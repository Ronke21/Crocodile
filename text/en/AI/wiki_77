<text>Paul Maurice Kelly (born 13 January 1955) is an Australian rock music singer-songwriter and guitarist. He has performed solo, and has led numerous groups, including the Dots, the Coloured Girls, and the Messengers. He has worked with other artists and groups, including associated projects Professor Ratbaggy and Stardust Five. Kelly&#x27;s music style has ranged from bluegrass to studio-oriented dub reggae, but his core output straddles folk, rock and country. His lyrics capture the vastness of the culture and landscape of Australia by chronicling life about him for over 30 years. David Fricke from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; calls Kelly &quot;one of the finest songwriters I have ever heard, Australian or otherwise&quot;. Kelly has said, &quot;Song writing is mysterious to me. I still feel like a total beginner. I don&#x27;t feel like I have got it nailed yet.&quot;

After growing up in Adelaide, Kelly travelled around Australia before settling in Melbourne in 1976. He became involved in the pub rock scene and drug culture and recorded two albums with the Dots. Kelly moved to Sydney by 1985, where he formed Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls. The band was renamed Paul Kelly and the Messengers, initially only for international releases, to avoid possible racial interpretations of the word &quot;coloured&quot;. At the end of the 1980s, Kelly returned to Melbourne, and in 1991 he disbanded the Messengers.

Kelly&#x27;s Top 40 singles include &quot;Billy Baxter&quot;, &quot;Before Too Long&quot;, &quot;Darling It Hurts&quot;, &quot;To Her Door&quot; (his highest-charting local hit in 1987), &quot;Dumb Things&quot; (appeared on United States charts in 1988) and &quot;Roll on Summer&quot;. Top-20 albums include &quot;Gossip&quot;, &quot;Under the Sun&quot;, &quot;Comedy&quot;, &quot;Songs from the South&quot; (1997 compilation), &quot;...Nothing but a Dream&quot;, &quot;Stolen Apples&quot;, &quot;Spring and Fall&quot;, &quot;The Merri Soul Sessions&quot;, &quot;Seven Sonnets and a Song&quot;, &quot;Death&#x27;s Dateless Night&quot; (with Charlie Owen), &quot;Life Is Fine&quot; (his first number-one album) and &quot;Nature&quot;. Kelly has won 14 Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Music Awards, including his induction into their hall of fame in 1997. Dan Kelly, his nephew, is a singer and guitarist in his own right. Dan performed with Kelly on &quot;Ways and Means&quot; and &quot;Stolen Apples&quot;. Both were members of Stardust Five, which released a self-titled album in 2006. On 22 September 2010, Kelly released his memoir, &quot;How to Make Gravy&quot;, which he described as &quot;it&#x27;s not traditional; it&#x27;s writing around the A–Z theme – I tell stories around the song lyrics in alphabetical order&quot;. His biographical film &quot;Paul Kelly: Stories of Me&quot;, directed by Ian Darling, was released to cinemas in October 2012.

In 2001, the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) listed the Top 30 Australian songs of all time, which included Kelly&#x27;s &quot;To Her Door&quot;, and &quot;Treaty&quot;, written by Kelly and members of Yothu Yindi. Aside from &quot;Treaty&quot;, Kelly wrote or co-wrote several songs on Indigenous Australian social issues and historical events. He provided songs for many other artists, tailoring them to their particular vocal range. The album &quot;Women at the Well&quot; from 2002 had 14 female artists record his songs in tribute.

Kelly was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2017 for distinguished service to the performing arts and to the promotion of the national identity through contributions as a singer, songwriter and musician. Kelly was married and divorced twice; he has three children and resides in St Kilda, a suburb of Melbourne.

==Early life and education==
Paul Maurice Kelly was born on 13 January 1955 in Adelaide, to John Erwin Kelly, a lawyer, and Josephine (née Filippini), the sixth of eight surviving children. According to &quot;Rip It Up&quot; magazine, &quot;legend has it&quot; that Kelly&#x27;s mother gave birth to him &quot;in a taxi outside North Adelaide&#x27;s Calvary Hospital&quot;.

Although Kelly was raised as a Roman Catholic, he later described himself as a non-believer. He is the great-great-grandson of Jeremiah Kelly, who emigrated from Ireland in 1852 and settled in Clare, South Australia. His paternal grandfather, Francis Kelly, established a law firm in 1917, which his father, John, joined in 1937.

John Kelly died in 1968 at the age of 52, after having been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease three years earlier. Paul Kelly was thirteen years old when his father died. Kelly described his father: &quot;I have good memories, he was the kind of father that, well, I missed him when he died very much. The older children were growing into him at the time he died. He was not well enough to play sport with me.&quot;

Kelly&#x27;s maternal grandfather was an Argentine-born, Italian-speaking opera singer, Count Ercole Filippini, a leading baritone for the La Scala Opera Company in Milan.

Filippini was touring Australia in 1914 with a Spanish opera company when World War I broke out; Filippini stayed and later married Anne McPharland, one of his students. As Countessa Anne Filippini, she was Australia&#x27;s first female symphony orchestra conductor. She sang the role of Marguerite in Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) Radio Perth&#x27;s performance of &quot;Faust&quot; in 1928.

Kelly&#x27;s grandparents started the Italo-Australian Opera Company, which toured the country in the 1920s.

Josephine raised the younger children alone after John&#x27;s death, but found time to assist others in need. Paul&#x27;s oldest sister, Anne, became a nun and went on to write hymns, while a younger sister, Mary-Jo, plays piano in Latin bands and teaches music.

His eldest brother, Martin, worked for Edmund Rice International, he passed in 2021 at the age of 69, with another brother, Tony, a drug and alcohol counsellor, who ran as an Australian Greens candidate in the 2001 and 2004 federal elections. Josephine Kelly moved to Brisbane, where she died in 2000 at the age of 76.

Kelly attended Rostrevor College, a Christian Brothers school, where he played trumpet and studied piano, became the first XI cricket captain, played in the first XVIII football (Australian rules), and was named dux of his senior year. He studied arts at Flinders University in 1973, but left after a term, disillusioned with academic life. He began writing prose and started a magazine with some friends.

Kelly spent several years working odd jobs, travelling around the country and learning guitar before he moved to Melbourne in 1976.

==Career==
===1974–1984: Early career and with the Dots===

While travelling around Australia, Paul Kelly made his first public performance in 1974 in Hobart. He later recalled:

His first published song, &quot;It&#x27;s the Falling Apart that Makes You&quot;, was written after listening to Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; at the age of 19, although in an interview with &quot;Drum Media&quot; he recalled writing his first song: &quot;It was an open-tuning and had four lines about catching trains. I have got a recording of it somewhere. It was called &#x27;Catching a Train&#x27;. I wrote a lot of songs about trains early on, trains and fires, and then I moved on to water&quot;.

In 1976, Kelly appeared on &quot;Debutantes&quot;, a compilation album featuring various Melbourne-based artists, and joined pub-rockers The High Rise Bombers from 1977 to 1978. The High Rise Bombers included Kelly (vocals, guitar, songwriter), Martin Armiger (guitar, vocals, songwriter), Lee Cass (bass guitar), Chris Dyson (guitar), Sally Ford (saxophone, songwriter), John Lloyd (drums), and Keith Shadwick (saxophone). Chris Langman (guitar, vocals) replaced Dyson in early 1978. [Langman never played with the High Rise Bombers and is incorrectly listed as a guitarist on the &quot;Melbourne Club&quot; album]. In August, after Armiger left for The Sports and Ford for the Kevins, Kelly formed Paul Kelly and the Dots with Langman and Lloyd. The High Rise Bombers recorded two tracks, &quot;She&#x27;s Got It&quot; and &quot;Domestic Criminal&quot;, which appeared on &quot;The Melbourne Club&quot;, a 1981 compilation by various artists on Missing Link Records. 

Kelly had already established himself as a respected songwriter—other Melbourne musicians would go to see him on their nights off. Richard Guilliatt, writing for &quot;The Monthly&quot;, later described Kelly from a 1979 performance at Richmond&#x27;s Kingston Hotel, the singer was &quot;a skinny guy with a head of black curls framing a pale face and a bent nose... singing with his eyes closed, one arm outstretched and the other resting on the body of the Fender Telecaster&quot;. Kelly was introduced to Hilary Brown at one of the Dots&#x27; gigs and they later married – the relationship is described in &quot;When I First Met Your Ma&quot; (1992). Brown&#x27;s father supplied Kelly with a gravy recipe – used on &quot;How to Make Gravy&quot; (1996). Their son, Declan, was born in 1980.

The Dots included various line-ups from 1978 to 1982. The band released their debut single &quot;Recognition&quot; in 1979, which did not reach the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart top 50. The Dots then signed to Mushroom Records, and at the record company&#x27;s insistence, were renamed Paul Kelly and the Dots. They issued &quot;Billy Baxter&quot; in November 1980, which peaked at No. 38. Rock music historian, Ian McFarlane described the single as a &quot;delightful, ska-tinged&quot; track. Kelly&#x27;s first television performance was &quot;Billy Baxter&quot; on the national pop show &quot;Countdown&quot;. Their debut album, &quot;Talk&quot;, followed in March 1981, which reached No. 44 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart. Late in 1981 Paul Kelly and the Dots recorded their second album, &quot;Manila&quot;, in the Philippines&#x27; capital. It was issued in August 1982, but had no chart success. Release was delayed by line-up changes and because Kelly was assaulted in Melbourne – he had his jaw broken.

In an October 1982 interview with &quot;The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, Kelly indicated he was more pleased with &quot;Manila&quot; than &quot;Talk&quot; as &quot;It has more unity ... with this one we didn&#x27;t have people dropping into the studio to play.&quot; Years later Kelly disavowed both Dots albums: &quot;I wish I could grab the other two and put &#x27;em in a big hole&quot;. The 1982 film, &quot;Starstruck&quot;, was directed by Gillian Armstrong and starred Jo Kennedy. Paul Kelly and the Dots supplied &quot;Rocking Institution&quot; for its soundtrack and Kelly added to the score. Kennedy released &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, a cover of Split Enz&#x27; &quot;She Got Body, She Got Soul&quot; as a shared single with &quot;Rocking Institution&quot;. Acting in a minor role in &quot;Starstruck&quot; was Kaarin Fairfax, who later became Kelly&#x27;s second wife. Kelly was without a recording contract after the Dots folded in 1982.

Paul Kelly Band was formed in 1983 with Michael Armiger (Martin Armiger&#x27;s younger brother, bass guitar), Chris Coyne (saxophone), Maurice Frawley (guitar) and Greg Martin (drums). By 1984 Michael Barclay (ex-the Zimmermen) replaced Martin on drums and Graham Lee (guitar, pedal steel guitar) joined. Kelly&#x27;s involvement in the Melbourne drug culture—he described his heroin addiction as &quot;a long period of occasional use&quot;—resulted in erratic performances. Problems with his marriage and drug use disrupted his career, and by 1984 the marriage had broken up. Hilary had moved to Sydney, initially leaving their young son with Kelly. He disbanded the group three months later and relocated to Sydney so he could share parenting responsibilities with Hilary while Declan grew up.

===1985–1991: Coloured Girls to Messengers===

Paul Kelly stayed with Don Walker (Cold Chisel) in Kings Cross – Walker had lived with Hilary&#x27;s sister – and wrote new songs on Walker&#x27;s piano. Kelly then moved into a flat with Paul Hewson (Dragon) in Elizabeth Bay. Both Walker and Hewson encouraged Kelly to continue with his song-writing. By January 1985, he recorded the self-funded album—at a cost of $3,500—&quot;Post&quot;. Session musicians included Michael Barclay (Weddings Parties Anything) on harmonies, guitarist Steve Connolly (the Zimmermen), and bass guitarist Ian Rilen (Rose Tattoo, X). They spent two weeks recording at Clive Shakespeare&#x27;s studio. Shakespeare engineered the album and co-produced with Kelly. It was released in May 1985 on the independent label White Records, and licensed to Mushroom Records.

Kelly dedicated &quot;Post&quot; to his former flatmate, Hewson, who had died of a heroin overdose in January. According to McFarlane: &quot;[it&#x27;s] a stark, highly personalised collection of acoustic songs that showcased the extraordinary breadth of Kelly&#x27;s songwriting skills.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (Australia) hailed &quot;Post&quot; as the best record of 1985. AllMusic&#x27;s Mike DeGagne felt &quot;While he focuses on life&#x27;s daily tragedies and tribulations, there is a missing element in the music, as it lacks any vigor or flash&quot;. A single, &quot;From St Kilda to Kings Cross&quot;, was released from the album, but did not chart. Russell Crowe, during his first trip to the US, visited the tourist venue of Death Valley and used &quot;Post&quot; to refocus himself: &quot;[his] concise insights and acerbic wisdom are exactly the music for strolling the bottom of ancient oceans, both literal and metaphoric&quot;. After recording &quot;Post&quot;, Kelly established a full-time band, which included Armiger, Barclay, and Connolly, bass guitarist Jon Schofield, and keyboardist Peter Bull.

Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls were named through a joke based on Lou Reed&#x27;s song &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;. Armiger soon left, and the Coloured Girls line-up stabilised in late 1985 as Barclay, Bull, Connolly, and Schofield. Stuart Coupe, Kelly&#x27;s manager, advised him to sign with Regular Records due to difficulty re-signing with Mushroom&#x27;s Michael Gudinski. Michelle Higgins, Mushroom&#x27;s public relations officer, was a Kelly supporter and locked herself into a Sebel Townhouse Hotel room—at Mushroom&#x27;s expense—for nearly a week in mid-1986, and refused to leave until Gudinski had signed Kelly to a two-album recording contract. Kelly performed for The Rock Party, a charity project initiated by The National Campaign Against Drug Abuse, which included other Australasian musicians. The Rock Party released a 12&quot; single, &quot;Everything to Live For&quot;, which was produced by Joe Wissert, Phil Rigger, and Phil Beazley.

In September, Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls released a 24-track double LP, &quot;Gossip&quot;. The album included remakes of four songs from &quot;Post&quot;, and also featured &quot;Maralinga (Rainy Land)&quot;, a song about the effects of British nuclear tests on the Maralinga Tjarutja (indigenous people of Maralinga, South Australia). &quot;Gossip&quot; peaked at No. 15, with singles chart success for &quot;Before Too Long&quot; which peaked at No. 15, and &quot;Darling It Hurts&quot; which reached No. 25. A single LP version of &quot;Gossip&quot; featuring 15 songs was issued in the United States by A&amp;M Records in July 1987. DeGagne noted that &quot;[it] bursts at the seams with blustery, distinguished tunes captivating both the somberness and the intrigue thrown forward from this fine Australian storyteller&quot;.

&quot;Gossip&quot; was co-produced by Kelly and Alan Thorne (Hoodoo Gurus, The Stems) who, according to music journalist Robert Forster (former The Go-Betweens singer-songwriter), helped the band create &quot;a sound that will not only influence future roots-rock bands but, through its directness, sparkle and dedication to the song, will also come to be seen as particularly Australian. Ultimately, it means the records these people made together are timeless&quot;. Due to possible racist connotations, the band changed its name for international releases to Paul Kelly and the Messengers. They made a US tour, initially supporting Crowded House and then headlining, travelling across the US by bus. &quot;Darling It Hurts&quot; peaked at No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart in 1987. &quot;The New York Times&quot; rock critic Jon Pareles wrote &quot;Mr. Kelly sang one smart, catchy three-minute song after another – dozens of them – as the band played with no-frills directness&quot; following the band&#x27;s performance at the Bottom Line Club in New York.

Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls&#x27; second album, &quot;Under the Sun&quot;, was released in late 1987 in Australia and New Zealand, and in early 1988 in North America and Europe (under the name Paul Kelly and the Messengers). On the Kent Music Report Albums Chart, it reached No. 19. The lead single &quot;To Her Door&quot;, written by Kelly, peaked at No. 14 on the related singles chart. Forster indicated that the song demonstrated one of Kelly&#x27;s finest qualities as a songwriter which is his unforced empathy. DeGagne observed a style similar to Elvis Costello and Steve Forbert, and said the album provided &quot;acoustically bright story songs and character-based tales with unlimited substance&quot;.

Another single, &quot;Dumb Things&quot;, was released in early 1989 and attained No. 36 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Singles Chart. In the US, it reached No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock chart. The song was included on the soundtrack for the 1988 Yahoo Serious film &quot;Young Einstein&quot;. The video, directed by Claudia Castle, won an ARIA Award for &#x27;Best Video&#x27;. Kelly met Kaarin Fairfax, his second wife, in 1988 and they married in 1993. From 1989 to 1992 Fairfax supplied backing vocals on tracks by Paul Kelly and the Messengers. In 1990, as country music artist Mary-Jo Starr, she released three singles and an album, &quot;Too Many Movies&quot;, using the Messengers and Kelly as session musicians. Michael Armiger, Connolly, and Frawley were in her backing tour band, The Drive-in Motel. Fairfax and Kelly&#x27;s two children are Madeleine and Memphis.

&quot;So Much Water So Close to Home&quot; was released in 1989 by Paul Kelly and the Messengers in all markets. It peaked at No. 10 on the ARIA Albums Chart, but none of its singles reached the ARIA Top 40 Singles Chart. Forster stated that, with &quot;Everything&#x27;s Turning to White&quot;, Kelly shows mastery in condensing a Raymond Carver tale of fishermen who discover a dead woman&#x27;s body but continue to fish before reporting their find. The same short story was used for the 2006 film, &quot;Jindabyne&quot;, for which Kelly composed the soundtrack. DeGagne preferred &quot;Everything&#x27;s Turning to White&quot; and &quot;Sweet Guy&quot; to the other album tracks, which &quot;seem a little weak in the content department&quot;. Kelly relocated back to Melbourne after having lived in Sydney for six years. Another US tour was undertaken, but there was no further chart success for albums or singles released in the US market.

In 1991 the band released &quot;Comedy&quot;, which peaked at No. 12 on the ARIA Albums Chart. DeGagne noticed &quot;a folk-filled tinge to each song, but the occasional quickened pace balances out these tunes rather nicely&quot;. &quot;From Little Things Big Things Grow&quot;, a seven-minute track from the album, was co-written by Kelly and Kev Carmody. It highlights the Gurindji Strike and Vincent Lingiari as part of the Indigenous Australian struggle for land rights and reconciliation. Forster indicates it has Dylanesque influences, and shows Kelly &quot;honing the skills of a fine balladeer and storyteller&quot;. A cover version that was released in May 2008 by The GetUp Mob, part of the GetUp! advocacy group, peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA singles charts. This version included samples from speeches by Prime Ministers Paul Keating in 1992 and Kevin Rudd in 2008. It featured vocals by Carmody and Kelly, as well as other Australian artists. Kelly collaborated with members of indigenous band Yothu Yindi to write &quot;Treaty&quot;, which peaked at No. 11 in September 1991.

&quot;To Her Door&quot; and &quot;Treaty&quot; were voted into the APRA Top 30 Australian songs of all time in 2001. Paul Kelly and the Messengers gave their last performance in August 1991, with Kelly set to pursue a solo career. He justified his decision: &quot;We forged a style together. But I felt if we had kept going it would have got formulaic and that&#x27;s why I broke it up. I wanted to try and start moving into other areas, start mixing things up&quot;. Paul Kelly and the Messengers&#x27; final album, &quot;Hidden Things&quot;, was a collection of previously released B-sides, stray non-LP tracks, radio sessions, and other rarities. It was released in May 1992, and reached No. 29. One track, &quot;Rally Around the Drum&quot;, written with Archie Roach, was about an indigenous tent boxing man.

===1992–99: Solo career and with others===
Since 1992 Paul Kelly has had a solo career, fronted the Paul Kelly Band, and worked in occasional collaborations with other songwriters and performers. In 1992 he was asked to compose songs for &quot;Funerals and Circuses&quot;, a Roger Bennett play about racial tensions in small-town Australia. Kelly took the role of a petrol attendant when the play premiered at the Adelaide Fringe Festival that year and was directed by his wife, Fairfax. Kelly co-wrote &quot;Hey Boys&quot; with Mark Seymour (Hunters &amp; Collectors) for the soundtrack of the 1992 Australian film, &quot;Garbo&quot;; when released as a single it peaked at No. 62. Kelly contributed songs and vocals to the soundtrack of the 1993 television series &quot;Seven Deadly Sins&quot;.

Kelly&#x27;s first post-Messengers solo release was the live double CD &quot;Live, May 1992&quot;, released in November 1992. AllMusic&#x27;s Brett Hartenbach noted that Kelly&#x27;s band had fleshed out his songs in the studio, but he was still able to show &quot;his vignettes of life, love, and the underbelly of both have plenty of power on their own&quot;. Kelly had relocated to Los Angeles and signed with Vanguard Records to tour the US as a solo artist. While in Los Angeles he produced fellow Australian Renée Geyer&#x27;s album &quot;Difficult Woman&quot; (1994). Kelly returned to Australia in 1993 and wrote a collection of lyrics, aptly titled &quot;Lyrics&quot;, which opens with a quote from Anton Chekhov: &quot;I don&#x27;t have what you would call a philosophy or coherent world view so I shall have to limit myself to describing how my heroes love, marry, give birth, die and speak.&quot;
His next album &quot;Wanted Man&quot;, released in 1994, reached No. 11. Kelly also composed music for the 1994 film &quot;Everynight ... Everynight&quot;, directed by Alkinos Tsilimidos. It is set in the notorious H division of Victoria&#x27;s Pentridge Prison. Kelly&#x27;s next solo releases were &quot;Deeper Water&quot; in 1995 and &quot;Live at the Continental and the Esplanade&quot; in 1996. Between March and May 1995 Kelly undertook a seven-week tour of North America, appearing on several dates with Liz Phair and Joe Jackson.

By 1996, Paul Kelly Band members included Stephen Hadley (bass, ex-Black Sorrows), Bruce Haymes (keyboards), Peter Luscombe (drums, ex-Black Sorrows), and Shane O&#x27;Mara (guitar). Spencer P. Jones (Beasts of Bourbon) was guest guitarist on some performances. This line-up issued the CD-EP &quot;How to Make Gravy&quot;, with the title track earning Kelly a &#x27;Song of the Year&#x27; nomination at the 1998 Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) Music Awards. APRA&#x27;s Debbie Kruger noted Kelly&#x27;s &quot;attraction to the theatrical&quot; where the same protagonist is described in &quot;To Her Door&quot;, &quot;Love Never Runs on Time&quot; (from &quot;Wanted Man&quot;) and &quot;How to Make Gravy&quot;.

In 1997, Kelly released his compilation album, &quot;Songs from the South: Paul Kelly&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, on Mushroom Records. The 20-track album peaked at No. 2, and has achieved quadruple platinum certification, indicating sales of over 280,000. Kelly won the ARIA Award in 1997 for &#x27;Best Male Artist&#x27;, having been previously nominated in 1993, 1995, and 1996. At 20 September 1997 ceremony, he was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Kelly won the &#x27;Best Male Artist&#x27; award again in 1998, and has been nominated for the same award a further seven times.

Kelly&#x27;s next album, &quot;Words and Music&quot;, appeared in 1998, which peaked at No. 17, and included three singles that did not reach the Top 40. Andrew Ford interviewed Kelly for ABC radio&#x27;s &quot;The Music Show&quot; in May. Ford found the album &quot;very exciting, very visceral ... you can almost smell the sex&quot;. Kelly admitted that he preferred R &amp; B music which deals with sex, love, and joy without becoming &quot;either banal or smug&quot;. He finds such songs more difficult to write but believes he has started to do so. 1998 also saw Kelly undertaking a three-week tour of Canada and the US to promote &quot;Words and Music&quot;.

&quot;Smoke&quot; was released by Paul Kelly with Uncle Bill; the latter is a Melbourne bluegrass band comprising Gerry Hale on guitar, dobro, mandolin, fiddle, and vocals; Adam Gare on fiddle, mandolin, and vocals; Peter Somerville on banjo and vocals; and Stuart Speed on double bass. The album featured a mix of old and new Kelly songs treated in classic bluegrass fashion. &quot;Our Sunshine&quot;, newly written, was a tribute to Ned Kelly, a famous Australian outlaw (not related). Kelly had previously recorded a Slim Dusty track with Uncle Bill, &quot;Thanks a Lot&quot;, for the compilation &quot;Where Joy Kills Sorrow&quot; (1997). &quot;Smoke&quot; was issued on Kelly&#x27;s new label, Gawdaggie, through EMI Records in October 1999, and peaked at No. 36. It won three awards from the Victorian Country Music Association: &#x27;Best Group (Open)&#x27;, &#x27;Best Group (Victorian)&#x27;, and &#x27;Album of the Year&#x27; in 2000. In September Kelly performed at the Spiegeltent at the Edinburgh Festival, as well as shows in London and Dublin.

In 1999 Kelly formed the band Professor Ratbaggy with Hadley (bass guitar, backing vocals), Haymes (keyboards, organ, backing vocals) and Luscombe (drums). Kelly provided guitars and vocals for their debut album, &quot;Professor Ratbaggy&quot;, on EMI Records. Songs were written jointly by all group members and their work was a more groove-oriented style compared to Kelly&#x27;s usual folk or rock formula, using samples, synthesiser and percussion. Kelly&#x27;s second anthology of lyrics entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Start Me Talking&quot; was first published in 1999, with subsequent songs appended in the 2004 edition. This second edition was added to the Victorian Certificate of Education English reading list for Year 12 (final year of secondary schooling) in 2006.

===2000–2009: Soundtracks and tribute albums===

During the 2000s Paul Kelly worked as a composer for film and TV scores and soundtracks, including &quot;Lantana&quot; (also as a member of Professor Ratbaggy), &quot;Silent Partner&quot;, and &quot;One Night the Moon&quot; in 2001, &quot;Fireflies&quot; in 2004, and &quot;Jindabyne&quot; in 2006. These works have resulted in five award wins: ARIA &#x27;Best Original Soundtrack&#x27; for &quot;Lantana&quot; (with Hadley, Haymes and O&#x27;Mara); Australian Film Institute (AFI) &#x27;Open Craft Award&#x27;, Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards &#x27;Best Music Score&#x27;, and Screen Music Award &#x27;Best Soundtrack Album&#x27; for &quot;One Night the Moon&quot; (with Mairead Hannan, Carmody, John Romeril, Deirdre Hannan, and Alice Garner); Valladolid International Film Festival &#x27;Best Music&#x27; award for &quot;Jindabyne&quot;; and six further nominations.

Kelly also acted in &quot;One Night the Moon&quot; alongside his then wife, Fairfax, and with their younger daughter Memphis. All three sing on the soundtrack, including together for the lullaby, &quot;One Night the Moon&quot;. According to Romaine Moreton, Australian Screen Online curator, the &quot;lullaby that the family sings, written by Paul Kelly, sets the tone of the film ... The song is used in this film as a vehicle to explore the characters&#x27; interior worlds, something very unusual for a film&quot;. Kelly and Fairfax separated before the film&#x27;s release.

&quot;Roll on Summer&quot; was released in 2000 as a four-track EP, which peaked at No. 40 on the ARIA singles charts. Kelly issued &quot;...Nothing but a Dream&quot; in 2001, returning to his core singer-songwriter style. It peaked at No. 7 on the albums chart, and achieved gold record status. The North American version of &quot;...Nothing but a Dream&quot; added all four tracks from the &quot;Roll on Summer&quot; EP as bonus tracks. Murray Bramwell appraised four Kelly-related works in &quot;Adelaide Review&quot;, &quot;each of them indicative of the rich variety of his gift&quot;. On the album &quot;...Nothing but a Dream&quot;, he preferred the opening track, &quot;If I Could Start Today Again&quot;, to the radio single, &quot;Somewhere in the City&quot;, and found the album generally to be &quot;full of familiar Kelly riffs and trademarks&quot;. On &quot;Silent Partner&quot; Kelly&#x27;s songwriting with Hale provides &quot;some splendid instrumentals&quot; with &quot;a delightfully airy sound&quot;. The &quot;Lantana&quot; soundtrack showed Kelly&#x27;s &quot;confidence as a composer and his strong grasp of a wide range of musical styles&quot;. Finally, &quot;One Night the Moon&quot; included Mairead Hannan&#x27;s &quot;richly melodic Irish airs&quot; which &quot;beautifully counterpoint Kelly&#x27;s work&quot; and Carmody&#x27;s &quot;distinctive ballads&quot;.

In March 2001 Kelly was a support act for Bob Dylan&#x27;s tour of Australia. Between August and November Kelly performed a series of acoustic shows in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, and France (the latter supporting Ani DiFranco). In 2002 he undertook a six-week tour of North America, which was followed by a tour of the UK and Ireland later that year. In 2002 and 2003 two tribute albums of Kelly&#x27;s songs were released: &quot;Women at the Well&quot; featured songs performed by female artists, including Bic Runga, Jenny Morris, Renée Geyer, Magic Dirt, Rebecca Barnard (Rebecca&#x27;s Empire), Christine Anu, and Kasey Chambers; and &quot;Stories of Me&quot;, which featured fellow songwriters James Reyne, Mia Dyson, and Jeff Lang. Chambers, a country music artist, sees Kelly as a role model: &quot;He&#x27;s the perfect example of the storyteller that I would love to be&quot;. In 2003 Kelly undertook a tour of North America, the UK, and Ireland, performing at the Edmonton International Fringe Festival and again at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

&quot;Ways &amp; Means&quot; was issued in 2004 and peaked at No. 13. Though identified as a solo record, it was more of a group effort, with a backing band, later dubbed the Boon Companions, co-writing most of the tracks. The Boon Companions consisted of Kelly&#x27;s nephew Dan Kelly on guitar, Peter Luscombe on drums, his brother Dan Luscombe on guitar and keyboards, and Bill McDonald on bass guitar. Bramwell was impressed with their live performance in May: &quot;Kelly steers and shapes not only his music, but the way he presents it. A live show is never just knocked together ... the details are always careful&quot;. In February ABC Television started broadcasting the series &quot;Fireflies&quot;, which featured a score by Kelly and Stephen Rae. The associated soundtrack CD, &quot;Fireflies: Songs of Paul Kelly&quot;, included tracks by Kelly, Paul Kelly and the Boon Companions, Professor Ratbaggy, and Paul Kelly with Uncle Bill. Sian Prior sang with the Boon Companions on the &quot;Fireflies&quot; track &quot;Los Cucumbros&quot;, which later appeared on &quot;Stardust Five&quot;. Prior, an opera singer, became Kelly&#x27;s girlfriend in 2002. They met when she interviewed him for &quot;Sunday Arts&quot; on ABC Radio. Prior is also a journalist and university lecturer.

In March 2004 Kelly performed across North America, including New York, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, and Los Angeles. This was followed by a more extensive series of shows between July and September throughout North America and Europe. In December, in Melbourne, Kelly performed 100 of his songs in alphabetical order over two nights. A similar set of shows were performed in a studio at Sydney Opera House in December 2006, these and similar sets became known as his A to Z shows. &quot;Foggy Highway&quot; was a second bluegrass-oriented album for Kelly, credited to Paul Kelly and the Stormwater Boys and issued in 2005. It peaked at No. 23 on the ARIA albums charts. The line-up for the majority of the tracks was Kelly, Mick Albeck (fiddle), James Gillard (bass guitar), Rod McCormack (guitar), Ian Simpson (banjo), and Trev Warner (mandolin). As with &quot;Smoke&quot; (his previous bluegrass release), &quot;Foggy Highway&quot; consisted of a mix of new compositions and rearranged Kelly classics. The Canadian edition of the release included a four-song bonus EP of out-takes.

In June 2005 Kelly put together &quot;Timor Leste – Freedom Rising&quot;, a collaboration of Australian artists donating new recordings, unreleased tracks, and b-sides to make connections between a wide range of music to raise money for environmental, health, and education projects in East Timor (Timor-Leste). Funds raised from the album went to Life, Love and Health and The Alola Foundation. On 26 March 2006 Kelly performed at the Commonwealth Games closing ceremony in Melbourne, singing &quot;Leaps and Bounds&quot; and &quot;Rally Around the Drum&quot;. On 8 October Paul Kelly and the Boon Companions, Hoodoo Gurus, and Sime Nugent performed at the Athenaeum Theatre in Melbourne to again raise funds for Life, Love and Health, and to help support their ongoing programs in Timor-Leste in response to the needs of the people during the humanitarian crisis.

Kelly formed Stardust Five in 2006, with the same line-up as Paul Kelly and the Boon Companions from &quot;Ways &amp; Means&quot;. They released their self-titled debut album in March, with each member contributing by composing the music and Kelly providing lyrics. The album has backing vocals by Prior on two tracks. Kelly toured North America again in 2006, appearing together with The Waifs at clubs and festivals in several US states and the Canadian province of Alberta. In November–December Kelly undertook his A-Z tour, a series of solo acoustic performances playing 100 of his songs in alphabetical order over four nights, at the Brisbane Powerhouse, Melbourne&#x27;s Spiegeltent, and at the Sydney Opera House.

In 2007 Kelly released &quot;Stolen Apples&quot;, containing songs based on religious themes; it peaked at No. 8, and achieved gold record status. Following the album&#x27;s recording, Dan Luscombe left to join The Drones. He was replaced by Ashley Naylor (Even) on guitar and Cameron Bruce (The Polaroids) on keyboards. A tour in support of the album saw Kelly perform the entire album plus selected hits from his catalogue. One of the last performances, on 20 September 2007 in Toowoomba, was filmed and released on DVD as &quot;Live Apples: Stolen Apples Performed Live in its Entirety Plus 16 More Songs&quot;, in April 2008.

Kelly made his first appearance at the Big Day Out concerts across Australia in early 2008, while in March he performed at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas. Kelly released &quot;Stolen Apples&quot; in Ireland and the UK in July, and followed with a tour there in August. In June &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper commemorated 50 years of Australian rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll (the anniversary of the release of Johnny O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s &quot;Wild One&quot;) by selecting the Top 50 Australian Albums. Kelly&#x27;s albums &quot;Gossip&quot; and &quot;Post&quot; rated at No. 7 and No. 30 on the list. Kelly was nominated as &#x27;Best Male Artist&#x27; for &quot;To Her Door (Live)&quot; and Best Music DVD for &quot;Live Apples&quot; at the 2008 ARIA Awards. In September he announced that he had reacquired the rights to his old catalogue, including those originally released by Mushroom Records—later bought out by Warner Bros. Records.

In November, as a result of the acquisition EMI released &quot;Songs from the South – Volume 2&quot;, a collection of Kelly&#x27;s songs from the last decade, following on from &quot;Songs from the South – Volume 1&quot;. The new compilation featured the first physical release of Kelly&#x27;s song, &quot;Shane Warne&quot;. Volume 1 and Volume 2 are available separately but also as a combined double album. EMI released a DVD, &quot;Paul Kelly – The Video Collection 1985–2008&quot;, a collection of Kelly&#x27;s home videos made over the past 23 years. Also included are several live performances. &quot;Songs from the South – Volume 2&quot; included one new song, &quot;Thoughts in the Middle of the Night&quot;, which he described as &quot;It&#x27;s a band song, we all wrote it together. There&#x27;s a poem by James Fenton, a British poet, called &quot;The Mistake&quot;, which is probably an influence on the lyrics. It&#x27;s a waking up in the middle of the night song, for anyone who&#x27;s woken up at 3 am and not been able to get back to sleep&quot;.

In the beginning of 2009 he supported Leonard Cohen&#x27;s tour of Australia – his first return in 24 years. Kelly&#x27;s duet with country singer Melinda Schneider, &quot;Still Here&quot;, won &#x27;Vocal Collaboration of the Year&#x27; at the 2009 CMAA Country Music Awards of Australia. In February, in response to hearing about the devastation to the Yarra Valley region of Victoria in Australia, Cohen and Kelly donated $200,000 to the Victorian Bushfire Appeal in support of those affected by the extensive Black Saturday bushfires that razed the area just weeks after their performance at the Rochford Winery for the &quot;A Day on the Green&quot; concert. Kelly performed at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 14 March for Sound Relief, a multi-venue rock music concert in support of victims of the bushfires. The event was held simultaneously with a concert at the Sydney Cricket Ground. All proceeds from the Melbourne concert went to the Red Cross Victorian Bushfire relief. Also performing at the Melbourne concert were Augie March, Bliss n Eso with Paris Wells, Gabriella Cilmi, Hunters &amp; Collectors, Jack Johnson, Chambers and Shane Nicholson with Troy Cassar-Daley, Kings of Leon, Jet, Midnight Oil, Liam Finn, Split Enz, and Wolfmother.

On 13 and 14 November, radio station Triple J presented a Kelly tribute concert—marking his 30th anniversary as a solo artist—at the Forum Theatre in Melbourne, and highlighted his contribution to Australian music. The line-up included Missy Higgins, John Butler, Paul Dempsey (Something for Kate), Katy Steele (Little Birdy), Bob Evans, Ozi Batla (The Herd), Dan Kelly, Clare Bowditch, Jae Laffer (The Panics), Adalita Srsen (Magic Dirt), Dan Sultan, and Megan Washington interpreting Kelly&#x27;s songs, with members of Augie March as the backing band and Ashley Naylor as musical director. A recording of the concerts was released by ABC Music as a DVD and a double CD, &quot;Before Too Long&quot;, with a bonus CD featuring original songs by Kelly, on 19 February 2010. Kelly&#x27;s national &#x27;More Songs from the South&#x27; tour in December 2009 included band members Vika Bull on vocals, Peter Luscombe on drums, Bill McDonald on bass guitar and backing vocals, Naylor on guitar, and Cameron Bruce on keyboards. Kelly contributed to the national magazine, &quot;The Monthly&quot;, from 2009 to 2010.

===2010–2013: &quot;How to Make Gravy&quot;, &quot;Stories of Me&quot; and &quot;Spring and Fall&quot;===

Paul Kelly published his memoir, &quot;How to Make Gravy&quot;, via Penguin Books (Australia) on 22 September 2010. &quot;It&#x27;s a mongrel memoir. It&#x27;s a bit hard to describe at the moment. It&#x27;s not traditional; it&#x27;s writing around the A-Z theme – I tell stories around the song lyrics in alphabetical order. It&#x27;s slow, so it will be a while coming, but I&#x27;ll get there&quot;. As a companion to his memoir, he issued an 8×CD box set, &quot;A – Z Recordings&quot;, with live performances from his A – Z Tours from 2004 to 2010. The 105 tracks are listed alphabetically, and were typically performed over four nights. The set includes a booklet of photographs. The related audio book on 16×CDs has Kelly joined by Australian actors, Cate Blanchett, Russell Crowe, Judy Davis, Hugh Jackman and Ben Mendelsohn each reading a chosen chapter.

Maurice Frawley, a guitarist for Kelly in various groups who co-wrote &quot;Look So Fine, Feel So Low&quot; (1987), died of cancer in May 2009. Kelly worked with Charlie Owen and others to create a 3×CD tribute album, &quot;Long Gone Whistle – The Songs of Maurice Frawley&quot;, which was released in August 2010. In July that year, Kelly performed at Splendour in the Grass. On 15 December 2010 he was inducted into The Age EG Awards Hall of Fame. In April 2011 Kelly performed at the East Coast Blues &amp; Roots Music Festival (Bluesfest), which was followed by appearances as a special guest at Dylan&#x27;s concerts in Sydney and Melbourne. Later that month, Kelly co-headlined a show with Neil Finn at Red Hill Auditorium in Perth; it was the first music concert at the new venue. In May his memoir, &quot;How to Make Gravy&quot;, was short-listed for the Prime Minister&#x27;s Literary Award in the non-fiction category; while in July it was co-winner of &#x27;Biography of the Year&#x27; at the Australian Book Industry Awards – with Anh Do&#x27;s &quot;The Happiest Refugee&quot;.

On 29 September 2012 Kelly performed &quot;How to Make Gravy&quot; and &quot;Leaps and Bounds&quot; at the AFL Grand Final although most of the performance was not broadcast on Seven Network&#x27;s pre-game segment. Nui Te Koha of &quot;Sunday Herald Sun&quot; declared &quot;Kelly, an integral part of Melbourne folklore and its music scene, and a noted footy tragic, deserved his place on the Grand Final stage – which has been long overdue ... broadcaster Seven&#x27;s refusal to show Kelly&#x27;s performance, except the last verse of &#x27;Leaps and Bounds&#x27;, was no laughing matter&quot;. On 19 October that year, Kelly issued a new studio album, &quot;Spring and Fall&quot;, which debuted at No. 8. It was recorded with Dan Kelly and Machine Translations&#x27; J Walker. Guest musicians include former band members Peter and Dan Luscombe, Vika and Linda Bull, and new collaborator, Laura Jean.
Also in October, a biographical film, &quot;Paul Kelly: Stories of Me&quot;, directed by Ian Darling, was released. Darling had worked on the project for two years and it included &quot;insights from family, friends, musicians and music journalists, as well as Kelly himself&quot;. &quot;The Australian Financial Review&quot;″s Katrina Strickland described the documentary as &quot;not a critique of his music, nor an intrusive look at his personal life&quot; which uses a &quot;much less linear approach to the life of a musician whose career has spanned four decades&quot;. After it appeared on ABC-TV in October of the following year, Andrew P. Street of &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted it &quot;brings an ambitious, complex young Kelly to life – making a relisten of his work essential&quot;.

===2013–2016: Collaborative albums===
During February and March 2013, Kelly and Neil Finn undertook a collaborative tour of Australia. Their performance on 10 March at the Sydney Opera House was recorded for the live album, &quot;Goin&#x27; Your Way&quot; (8 November 2013). It was issued as a 2× CD, which peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart; and also as a DVD, which peaked at No. 1 on the related ARIA Music DVD Chart. Later in March, Kelly toured New Zealand with Dan Kelly to promote &quot;Spring and Fall&quot; by playing in church venues.

&quot;Goin&#x27; Your Way&quot; was the first of several collaborative albums Kelly would release in the following years. &quot;The Merri Soul Sessions&quot; was released December 2014, and features contributions from the Bull sisters, Kira Puru, Clairy Browne and Dan Sultan. The ensemble would also tour together in late 2014 and early 2015. In 2016, Kelly would release two albums: &quot;Seven Sonnets and a Song&quot; in April, which was a musical recreation of selected works by William Shakespeare; and &quot;Death&#x27;s Dateless Night&quot; in October, a covers album with Charlie Owen.

===2017–present: &quot;Life Is Fine&quot; and &quot;Nature&quot;===

Kelly&#x27;s first solo album in five years, &quot;Life Is Fine&quot;, was released in August 2017. The album became his first number-one album and won him four ARIA Awards at that year&#x27;s ceremony. In November and December 2017, Kelly and his band undertook a seventeen-performance tour of thirteen metropolitan and regional Australian cities, as well as four performances in three cities in New Zealand to promote the release of &quot;Life is Fine&quot;. Supports on the tour included Steve Earle, Middle Kids, Busby Marou and The Eastern. Kelly was also a featured artist on the 2018 Groovin&#x27; the Moo festival.

In August 2018, Kelly announced the release of a new album, &quot;Nature&quot;, in October. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;With the One I Love&quot;, was released on the same day. He released another compilation album in November 2019, covering 1985–2019, &quot;Songs from the South: 1985-2019&quot;. In September 2019, he performed at the MCG in the pre-game show at the 2019 AFL Grand Final Day.

On 5 February 2020, Kelly released a single titled, &quot;Sleep, Australia, Sleep&quot;. The song addresses Australia&#x27;s response to climate change. Before the release of the single, the lyrics were published by The Sydney Morning Herald, with Kelly describing the song as &quot;a lament in the form of a lullaby. Paradoxically, it can also be heard as a wake up call - a critique of the widespread attitude amongst humans that we are the most important life form on the planet.&quot;

In September 2021, Kelly released a song inspired by Australian Rules footballer Eddie Betts and his battle with racism, titled &quot;Every Step of the Way&quot;. On 19 November 2021, Kelly released his twenty-eighth studio album, &quot;Paul Kelly&#x27;s Christmas Train&quot;.

In July 2023, Kelly released a book and song titled, &quot;Khawaja&quot;, inspired by Usman Khawaja.

In November 2023, Kelly was inducted into the South Australian Music Awards Hall of Fame.

==Musical style and songwriting==

Paul Kelly has been acknowledged as one of Australia&#x27;s best singer-songwriters. His music style has ranged from bluegrass to studio-oriented dub reggae, but his core output comfortably straddles folk, rock, and country. His lyrics capture Australia&#x27;s vastness both in culture and landscape; he has chronicled life about him for over 30 years and is described as the poet laureate of Australia. According to music writer Glenn A. Baker, his Australian-ness may be a reason Kelly has not achieved international success. David Fricke from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; calls Kelly &quot;one of the finest songwriters I have ever heard, Australian or otherwise.&quot;

Fellow songwriter Neil Finn (Crowded House) has said, &quot;There is something unique and powerful about the way Kelly mixes up everyday detail with the big issues of life, death, love and struggle – not a trace of pretence or fakery in there&quot;. Ross Clelland, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, described Kelly: &quot;[W]hile he was (rightly) lauded for his ability to sing of injustice without ranting, or deal with the darker sides of human nature non-judgementally, often overlooked was the fact he could write a damn fine melodic hook to go with those words&quot;. Tim Freedman (The Whitlams) acknowledges Kelly, Peter Garrett (Midnight Oil), and John Schumann (Redgum) as inspiring him by &quot;[furnishing] our suburbs with our own myths and social history&quot;. However, Kelly has been quoted as saying &quot;Song writing is mysterious to me. I still feel like a total beginner. I don&#x27;t feel like I have got it nailed yet&quot;. In 2007 Kelly donated his &#x27;Lee Oskar&#x27; harmonica to the Sydney Powerhouse Museum. The museum&#x27;s statement of significance cites Kelly&#x27;s talent as a songwriter, his distinctive voice, and his harmonica playing, particularly on &quot;Live, May 1992&quot;.
Kelly described his songwriting as &quot;a scavenging art, a desperate act. For me it&#x27;s a bit from here, a bit from there, fumbling around, never quite knowing what you&#x27;re doing ... Song writing is like a way of feeling connected to mystery.&quot; He has resisted the label of &#x27;storyteller&#x27; and insists that his songs are not strictly autobiographical; &quot;they come from imagining someone in a particular situation. Sometimes a sequence of events happens which makes it more a story, but other times it&#x27;s just that situation&quot;. Sometimes the same character is found in different songs, such as in &quot;To Her Door&quot;, &quot;Love Never Runs on Time&quot;, and &quot;How to Make Gravy&quot;.

Kelly has also provided songs for many other artists, tailoring them to their particular vocal range. &quot;Women at the Well&quot; (2002) had 14 female artists record his songs in tribute. According to Kelly, he adapted his song &quot;Foggy Highway&quot; for Renée Geyer because &quot;I admired her deep soul singing, ferocious and vulnerable ... When I heard the finished version ... the hairs rose up on the back of my neck.&quot; Kelly and The Stormwater Boys recorded it in a bluegrass style as the title track for the 2005 album &quot;Foggy Highway&quot;. Divinyls&#x27; lead singer Christina Amphlett recorded &quot;Before Too Long&quot;—she was attracted by the lyrics—she interpreted the song&#x27;s narrator as being a stalker, and provided a female perspective in a darkly menacing manner à-la &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;.

Kelly has written songs with and for numerous artists, including Mick Thomas, Geyer, Kate Ceberano, Vika and Linda Bull, Nick Cave, Nick Barker, Kasey Chambers, Yothu Yindi, Archie Roach, Gyan, Monique Brumby, Kelly Willis, Missy Higgins, and Troy Cassar-Daley. He has described how some songs he writes are suited to other vocal ranges. &quot;Quite often, I&#x27;m trying to write a certain kind of song and it&#x27;s more ambitious than what my voice will get to. That&#x27;s how I started writing songs with other people in mind&quot;. Kelly and Carmody&#x27;s &quot;From Little Things Big Things Grow&quot; was analysed by Sydney University&#x27;s Linguistics professor James R Martin. &quot;[They] render the story as a narrative ... with the familiar Orientation, Complication, Evaluation, Resolution and Coda staging&quot;. Martin finds that Kelly and Carmody made the point that when people exert their rights with support from friends, they may defeat those with prestige.

Kelly understands that co-writing with other songwriters lends power to his songs. &quot;You often write songs with collaborators that you would never write by yourself. It&#x27;s a way of dragging a song out of you that you wouldn&#x27;t have come up with&quot;. One of his collaborators, Linda Bull, described Kelly&#x27;s process: they would start with a simple chat. &quot;We&#x27;d just chuck ideas around and he&#x27;d pick the best bits. He&#x27;d take all the bluntness and crudeness out of it and make it beautiful; that&#x27;s his magic ... It&#x27;s conversations that you have &quot;. Forster summarised his 2009 review of Kelly&#x27;s compilation, &quot;Songs from the South&quot;, with &quot;[his songs] sound easy and approachable ... Then you think: If the songs are so simple and the ideas behind them so clear, why aren&#x27;t more people writing like Paul Kelly and sounding as good as he does?&quot; In 2010 Carmody and Kelly&#x27;s &quot;From Little Things Big Things Grow&quot; was added to the National Film and Sound Archive&#x27;s Sounds of Australia Registry.

==Personal life==
Kelly&#x27;s first marriage (1980–84) was to Hilary Brown; the couple had a son, Declan, who later worked as a radio presenter on 3RRR&#x27;s &quot;Against the Arctic&quot; from 2006. As of 2007, he was a DJ around Melbourne and played the drums. For &quot;Paul Kelly: Stories of Me&quot;, Declan recalled his feelings whenever he hears &quot;When I First Met Your Ma&quot;, which describes Kelly&#x27;s courtship of Hilary Brown. Brown remembered &quot;songs written especially for and about her&quot; but also about other women, she quipped &quot;There are too many girls out there! One for every song!&quot;

Kelly&#x27;s second marriage (1993–2001) was to actress Kaarin Fairfax. &quot;The Monthly&quot;″s Richard Guilliatt travelled with Kelly, his band and &quot;his new love and future wife, the diminutive&quot; Fairfax on a section of the group&#x27;s US tour prior to the release of &quot;Under the Sun&quot;. The couple have two daughters, Madeleine and Memphis. From 1989 to 1992, Fairfax supplied backing vocals on tracks by Paul Kelly and the Messengers. In 1990, as Mary-Jo Starr, a country music artist, Fairfax released three singles and an album called &quot;Too Many Movies&quot;. Memphis Kelly starred alongside her parents in the Rachel Perkins short film &quot;One Night the Moon&quot; (2001) for which Paul Kelly composed the score. After the couple separated in 2001, Madeleine and Memphis stayed with Fairfax, but Kelly maintained contact with his daughters. In 2010, Madeleine and Memphis formed a pop indie trio, Wishful, with Sam Humphrey; they were later joined by Harley Hamer and Caleb Williams. In March 2014, Wishful performed at the Port Fairy Folk Festival.

Kelly was in a relationship with Sian Prior, a journalist, university lecturer and opera singer, from 2002 to 2011. They met when Kelly was interviewed on her &quot;Sunday Arts&quot; ABC radio program. Kelly wrote &quot;You&#x27;re 39, You&#x27;re Beautiful and You&#x27;re Mine&quot; for Prior who was already 40 by the time he finished. Prior has played clarinet and provided backing vocals on some of Kelly&#x27;s songs, as well as with the Stardust Five. She has performed live with Kelly on several occasions, including clarinet on six tracks of his &quot;A – Z Recordings&quot; boxed set.

In his memoir, Kelly credited Prior with inspiring him to give up his long-term heroin addiction, &quot;I got lucky, I met a woman who said: &#x27;It&#x27;s me or it&#x27;. She gave me the number of a counsellor ... I thought about &#x27;it&#x27; every day for a long time. Less now&quot;. The couple had separated during the making of Kelly&#x27;s biopic, however the separation is not mentioned and Prior is not interviewed in the film. According to Prior after a date in 2011, &quot;[we] came home. He sat on the bed. &#x27;I&#x27;ve decided I want to be single again,&#x27; he told her. &#x27;Yes, I have been with other women.&#x27;&quot; The split occurred after she had filmed her interview and &quot;after the breakup, [she] requested the footage not be used. Her presence in Kelly&#x27;s life is as a footnote in the credits. It&#x27;s as if she was never there.&quot;

Siân Darling became Kelly&#x27;s partner. They met in 2014 performing in a theatre show called &quot;Funeral&quot;. The couple continue to live and work together from their St Kilda base. Darling is an artist, activist, curator and producer and has been working on Kelly&#x27;s professional management team since 2018. Her influence on Kelly&#x27;s work is noted in the Stuart Coupe biography. Darling is the subject of several songs and has produced and directed some of Kelly&#x27;s music videos: &quot;With the One I Love&quot;, &quot;Sleep Australia Sleep&quot; and &quot;When We&#x27;re Both Old and Mad&quot;. Darling produced the 2020 re-issue version of Carmody&#x27;s album &quot;Cannot Buy My Soul&quot;.

Kelly&#x27;s brother, Martin, is the father of Dan Kelly, a singer-guitarist. Dan has performed with his uncle on several of Kelly&#x27;s albums, including &quot;Ways and Means&quot;, as a member of Paul Kelly and the Boon Companions, and on &quot;Stolen Apples&quot;. Dan and Paul were both members of Stardust Five, which released &quot;Stardust Five&quot;.

Paul Kelly&#x27;s younger sister, Mary Jo Kelly, is a Melbourne-based pianist who performed with him on the track &quot;South of Germany&quot; for &quot;Paul Kelly Live at the Athenaeum, May 1992&quot; (1992). She has performed in Latin bands and worked as a music teacher at the Victorian College of the Arts Secondary School. Mary Jo provided piano on Archie Roach&#x27;s album &quot;Charcoal Lane&quot; (1990), which was produced by Kelly and Connolly.

==Awards and recognition==

Paul Kelly has won several awards, including 17 ARIA Awards from the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and five APRA Awards from either the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) alone or together with the Australian Guild of Screen Composers. APRA named &quot;To Her Door&quot;, solely written by Kelly, and &quot;Treaty&quot;, written by Kelly and members of Yothu Yindi, in their Top 30 best Australian songs of all time in 2001. Kelly was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 1997, alongside the Bee Gees and Graeme Bell. He has won six Country Music Awards from the Country Music Association of Australia, and four Mo Awards (Australian entertainment industry). Kelly was a Victorian State Finalist for the 2012 Australian of the Year Award. Kelly was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2017 for distinguished service to the performing arts and to the promotion of the national identity through contributions as a singer, songwriter and musician.

In August 2022, the City of Adelaide renamed a laneway in the city centre off Flinders Street Paul Kelly Lane. Previously named Pilgrim Lane after the adjacent Pilgrim Uniting Church, the lane is now called Paul Kelly Lane. It is the fourth such renaming after musicians associated with the city, the others being Sia Furler, No Fixed Address, and Cold Chisel.

<text>Paul John Kelly (born 11 October 1947) is an Australian political journalist, author and television and radio commentator from Sydney. He has worked in a variety of roles, principally for &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper and is currently its editor-at-large. Kelly also appears as a commentator on Sky News Australia and has written seven books on political events in Australia since the 1970s including on the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis. Recent works include &quot;The March of Patriots&quot;, which chronicles the creation of a modern Australia during the 1991–2007 era of prime ministers, Paul Keating and John Howard, and &quot;Triumph &amp; Demise&quot; which focuses on the leadership tensions at the heart of the Rudd-Gillard Labor governments of 2007 to 2011. Kelly presented the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) TV documentary series &quot;100 Years – The Australian Story&quot; (2001) and wrote a book of the same title.

In 2006, Kelly&#x27;s work was described by fellow Australian journalists Toby Creswell and Samantha Trenoweth as being &quot;distinguished for his broad and deep grasp of the inter-relationship of economics and political shifts, and his ability to place Australian domestic developments into an international and historical context&quot;.

==Life and career==
Paul John Kelly was born on 11 October 1947 in Sydney, New South Wales. He is the son of Joseph Kelly and Sybil (née Mackenzie). He completed a Bachelor of Arts degree and Diploma of Education at the University of Sydney in 1969. He worked in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department in Canberra from 1969 to 1971 before changing to journalism. He is a Doctor of Letters from the University of Melbourne.

He joined the Canberra Press Gallery in 1971 and became chief political correspondent for &quot;The Australian&quot; from 1974 to 1975. From 1976 to 1978 he was chief political correspondent for &quot;The National Times&quot;, then its deputy editor from 1978 to 1979. He became chief political correspondent for the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; from 1981 to 1984. He returned to &quot;The Australian&quot; and was its national affairs editor from 1985 to 1991, editor-in-chief from 1991 to 1996 and editor-at-large from 1996 to the present.

Aside from journalism, Kelly has written books describing political developments starting with &quot;The Unmaking of Gough&quot; (1976) on the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975 and Prime Minister Gough Whitlam (later titled &quot;The Dismissal : Australia&#x27;s Most Sensational Power Struggle : The Dramatic Fall of Gough Whitlam&quot;). He has written books on subsequent Prime Ministers, Bob Hawke (&quot;The Hawke Ascendency&quot;, 1984), Paul Keating (&quot;The End of Certainty&quot;, 1992) and John Howard (&quot;Howard&#x27;s Decade&quot;, 2006). His &quot;The March of Patriots: The Struggle for Modern Australia&quot; (2009) deals with economic and political developments under Keating and Howard as Australia entered the globalised age. &quot;Triumph &amp; Demise: The Broken Promise of a Labor Generation&quot; (2014) chronicles the rise and fall of the Australian Labor Party governments of Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard (2007–2013).

His book &quot;The Dismissal&quot; was used as the basis of the television miniseries &quot;The Dismissal&quot; shown on Network Ten from 6 March 1983. Kelly is a political commentator on radio and television (including &quot;Insiders&quot;) and presented the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) TV documentary series, &quot;100 Years – The Australian Story&quot; (2001) and wrote a book of the same title.

In November 1991, after the massacres at Santa Cruz (near Dili, East Timor), Kelly had supported Indonesian president Suharto and declared him to be a moderate with no alternative to his rule. Kelly&#x27;s support for Suharto continued to 1998 and earned criticism from fellow journalist John Pilger who compared it to the appeasement of Hitler in the 1930s.

In November 2012, Kelly criticised the decision of the Gillard government to create the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, calling it &quot;profoundly ignorant&quot; and &quot;a depressing example of populist politics&quot;.

==Personal life==
He is married to Margaret (née Leckie). They have two sons, Joseph and Daniel. Kelly was previously married to Australian Labor Party federal member of Parliament and minister Ros Kelly (née Raw).

Kelly opposed Australia&#x27;s same-sex marriage legislation, questioning the &quot;real ideology&quot; of the same-sex marriage campaign and its impact on &quot;religious freedom&quot;.

<text>Paul Kelly (born 28 July 1969) is a former Australian rules footballer, winner of the Brownlow Medal and captain of the Sydney Swans for ten seasons. He was and still is known to Swans fans everywhere as &quot;Captain Courageous&quot;.

Born and raised in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Kelly attended St Michaels School and initially played rugby league for Wagga Brothers but turned to Australian rules football at age 15. Recruited to the AFL by the Swans, Kelly made his debut in 1990 after being the best player in his school, and was appointed captain in 1993 at just 23 years of age, won the Brownlow Medal (the AFL&#x27;s highest individual honour) in 1995, won club best and fairests in 1992, 1993, 1996 and 1997, All-Australian selection in 1995, 1996 and 1997 (the last two as captain), and the AFL Players Association&#x27;s Robert Rose Award for Most Courageous Player in 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 2000.

Kelly led the Swans to the AFL Grand Final in 1996—its first since 1945—and was considered one of the best players in the competition during the mid-1990s, but from 1998 onwards was severely hampered by injuries. Kelly retired after 234 AFL games and served as the Swans runner in 2003 before retiring to his farm near Wagga Wagga. His autobiography, &quot;Swan Song&quot;, was published in 2003 and covers the period until his retirement from football. His No. 14 jumper was retired for 5 years, before it was brought out again, this time to be worn by Craig Bird. The current wearer of the no. 14 jumper at the Swans is co-captain Callum Mills.

In 2005, Kelly was on hand to present the premiership cup to Paul Roos and Barry Hall after the Swans&#x27; nailbiting 4-point Grand Final win.

In 2006, he presented the Brownlow Medal to former team mate, Adam Goodes.

He was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in July, 2007.

<doc id="43303" wikidata="Q381047" url="?curid=43303" title="NCSA Mosaic">
<text>NCSA Mosaic was among the first widely available web browsers, instrumental in popularizing the World Wide Web and the general Internet by integrating multimedia such as text and graphics. Mosaic was the first browser to display images inline with text (instead of a separate window).

Named for supporting multiple Internet protocols, including Hypertext Transfer Protocol, File Transfer Protocol, Network News Transfer Protocol, and Gopher, its intuitive interface, reliability, personal computer support, and simple installation all contributed to Mosaic&#x27;s initial popularity. Mistakenly described as the first graphical web browser, it was preceded by WorldWideWeb, the lesser-known Erwise, and ViolaWWW.

Mosaic was developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign beginning in late 1992, released in January 1993, with official development and support until January 1997. Mosaic lost market share to Netscape Navigator in late 1994, and had only a tiny fraction of users left by 1997, when the project was discontinued. Microsoft licensed one of the derivative commercial products, Spyglass Mosaic, to create Internet Explorer in 1995.

== History ==

In December 1991, the High Performance Computing Act of 1991 was passed, which provided funding for new projects at the NCSA, where after trying ViolaWWW, David Thompson demonstrated it to the NCSA software design group. This inspired Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina – two programmers working at NCSA – to create Mosaic. Andreessen and Bina began developing Mosaic in December 1992 for Unix&#x27;s X Window System, calling it &quot;xmosaic&quot;. Marc Andreessen announced the project&#x27;s first release, the &quot;alpha/beta version 0.5,&quot; on January 23, 1993. Version 1.0 was released on April 21, 1993. Ports to Microsoft Windows and Macintosh were released in September. A port of Mosaic to the Amiga was available by October 1993. NCSA Mosaic for Unix (X Window System) version 2.0 was released on November 10, 1993 and was notable for adding support for forms, thus enabling the creation of the first dynamic web pages. From 1994 to 1997, the National Science Foundation supported the further development of Mosaic.

Marc Andreessen, the leader of the team that developed Mosaic, left NCSA and, with James H. Clark, one of the founders of Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI), and four other former students and staff of the University of Illinois, started Mosaic Communications Corporation. Mosaic Communications eventually became Netscape Communications Corporation, producing Netscape Navigator. Mosaic&#x27;s popularity as a separate browser began to decrease after the 1994 release of Netscape Navigator, the relevance of which was noted in &quot;The HTML Sourcebook: The Complete Guide to HTML&quot;: &quot;Netscape Communications has designed an all-new WWW browser Netscape, that has significant enhancements over the original Mosaic program.&quot;

In 1994, SCO released Global Access, a modified version of SCO&#x27;s Open Desktop Unix, which became the first commercial product to incorporate Mosaic. However, by 1998, the Mosaic user base had almost completely evaporated as users moved to other web browsers.

==Licensing==
The licensing terms for NCSA Mosaic were generous for a proprietary software program. In general, non-commercial use was free of charge for all versions (with certain limitations). Additionally, the X Window System/Unix version publicly provided source code (source code for the other versions was available after agreements were signed). Despite persistent rumors to the contrary, however, Mosaic was never released as open source software during its brief reign as a major browser; there were always constraints on permissible uses without payment.

, license holders included these:
* Amdahl Corporation
* Fujitsu Limited (Product: Infomosaic, a Japanese version of Mosaic. Price: Yen5,000 (approx US$50)
* Infoseek Corporation (Product: No commercial Mosaic. May use Mosaic as part of a commercial database effort)
* Quadralay Corporation (Consumer version of Mosaic. Also using Mosaic in its online help and information product, GWHIS. Price: US$249)
* Quarterdeck Office Systems Inc.
* The Santa Cruz Operation Inc. (Product: Incorporating Mosaic into &quot;SCO Global Access&quot;, a communications package for Unix machines that works with SCO&#x27;s Open Server. Runs a graphical e-mail service and accesses newsgroups.)
* SPRY Inc. (Products: A communication suite: Air Mail, Air News, Air Mosaic, etc. Also producing Internet In a Box with O&#x27;Reilly &amp; Associates. Price: US$149–$399 for Air Series.)
* Spyglass, Inc. (Product: Spyglass Mosaic, essentially licensing the Mosaic name, as it was written from scratch not using NCSA&#x27;s Mosaic code. Relicensing to other vendors. Signed deal with Digital Equipment Corp. to ship Mosaic with all its machines. Signed a deal with Microsoft to license Spyglass&#x27; code to develop Internet Explorer)

==Features==
Robert Reid notes that Andreessen&#x27;s team hoped:

Mosaic is based on the libwww library and thus supported a wide variety of Internet protocols included in the library: Archie, FTP, gopher, HTTP, NNTP, telnet, WAIS.

Mosaic is not the first web browser for Microsoft Windows; this is Thomas R. Bruce&#x27;s little-known Cello. The Unix version of Mosaic was already famous before the Microsoft Windows, Amiga, and Mac versions were released. Other than displaying images embedded in the text (rather than in a separate window), Mosaic&#x27;s original feature set is similar to the browsers on which it was modeled, such as ViolaWWW. But Mosaic was the first browser written and supported by a team of full-time programmers, was reliable and easy enough for novices to install, and the inline graphics proved immensely appealing. Mosaic is said to have made the Internet accessible to the ordinary person.

Mosaic was the first browser to explore the concept of collaborative annotation in 1993 but never passed the test state.

Mosaic was the first browser that could submit forms to a server.

== Impact ==
Mosaic led to the Internet boom of the 1990s. Other browsers existed during this period, such as Erwise, ViolaWWW, MidasWWW, and tkWWW, but did not have the same effect as Mosaic on public use of the Internet.

In the October 1994 issue of &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, Gary Wolfe notes in the article titled &quot;The (Second Phase of the) Revolution Has Begun: Don&#x27;t look now, but Prodigy, AOL, and CompuServe are all suddenly obsolete – and Mosaic is well on its way to becoming the world&#x27;s standard interface&quot;:

Reid also refers to Matthew K. Gray&#x27;s website, Internet Statistics: Growth and Usage of the Web and the Internet, which indicates a dramatic leap in web use around the time of Mosaic&#x27;s introduction.

David Hudson concurs with Reid:

Ultimately, web browsers such as Mosaic became the &quot;killer applications&quot; of the 1990s. Web browsers were the first to bring a graphical interface to search tools the Internet&#x27;s burgeoning wealth of distributed information services. A mid-1994 guide lists Mosaic alongside the traditional, text-oriented information search tools of the time, Archie and Veronica, Gopher, and WAIS but Mosaic quickly subsumed and displaced them all. Joseph Hardin, the director of the NCSA group within which Mosaic was developed, said downloads were up to 50,000 a month in mid-1994.

In November 1992, there were twenty-six websites in the world and each one attracted attention. In its release year of 1993, Mosaic had a What&#x27;s New page, and about one new link was being added per day. This was a time when access to the Internet was expanding rapidly outside its previous domain of academia and large industrial research institutions. Yet it was the availability of Mosaic and Mosaic-derived graphical browsers themselves that drove the explosive growth of the Web to over 10,000 sites by August 1995 and millions by 1998. Metcalfe expressed the pivotal role of Mosaic this way:

== Legacy ==
Netscape Navigator was later developed by Netscape, which employed many of the original Mosaic authors; however, it intentionally shared no code with Mosaic. Netscape Navigator&#x27;s code descendant is Mozilla Firefox.

Spyglass, Inc. licensed the technology and trademarks from NCSA for producing its own web browser but never used any of the NCSA Mosaic source code. Microsoft licensed Spyglass Mosaic in 1995 for US$2 million, modified it, and renamed it Internet Explorer. After a later auditing dispute, Microsoft paid Spyglass $8 million. The 1995 user guide &quot;The HTML Sourcebook: The Complete Guide to HTML&quot;, specifically states, in a section called &quot;Coming Attractions&quot;, that Internet Explorer &quot;will be based on the Mosaic program&quot;. Versions of Internet Explorer before version 7 stated &quot;Based on NCSA Mosaic&quot; in the About box. Internet Explorer 7 was audited by Microsoft to ensure that it contained no Spyglass Mosaic code, and thus no longer credits Spyglass or Mosaic.

After NCSA stopped work on Mosaic, development of the NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System source code was continued by several independent groups. These independent development efforts include mMosaic (multicast Mosaic) which ceased development in early 2004, and Mosaic-CK and VMS Mosaic.

VMS Mosaic, a version specifically targeting OpenVMS operating system, is one of the longest-lived efforts to maintain Mosaic. Using the VMS support already built-in in original version (Bjorn S. Nilsson ported Mosaic 1.2 to VMS in the summer of 1993), developers incorporated a substantial part of the HTML engine from mMosaic, another defunct flavor of the browser. As of the most recent version (4.2), released in 2007, VMS Mosaic supported HTML 4.0, OpenSSL, cookies, and various image formats including GIF, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TGA, TIFF and JPEG 2000 image formats. The browser works on VAX, Alpha, and Itanium platforms.

Another long-lived version, Mosaic-CK, developed by Cameron Kaiser, was last released (version 2.7ck9) on July 11, 2010; a maintenance release with minor compatibility fixes (version 2.7ck10) was released on January 9, 2015, followed by another one (2.7ck11) in October 2015. The stated goal of the project is &quot;Lynx with graphics&quot; and runs on Mac OS X, Power MachTen, Linux and other compatible Unix-like OSs.

<doc id="43308" wikidata="Q984246" url="?curid=43308" title="John Gilmore (activist)">
<text>John Gilmore (born 1955) is an American activist. He is one of the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Cypherpunks mailing list, and Cygnus Solutions. He created the &quot;alt.*&quot; hierarchy in Usenet and is a major contributor to the GNU Project.

An outspoken civil libertarian, Gilmore has sued the Federal Aviation Administration, the United States Department of Justice, and others. He was the plaintiff in the prominent case &quot;Gilmore v. Gonzales&quot;, challenging secret travel-restriction laws, which he lost. He is an advocate for drug policy reform.

He co-authored the Bootstrap Protocol in 1985, which evolved into Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), the primary way local networks assign an IP address to devices.

== Life and career ==

As the fifth employee of Sun Microsystems and founder of Cygnus Support, he became wealthy enough to retire early and pursue other interests. He is also one of the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation based in San Francisco.

He is a frequent contributor to free software, and worked on several GNU projects, including maintaining the GNU Debugger in the early 1990s, initiating GNU Radio in 1998, starting Gnash media player in December 2005 to create a free software player for Flash movies, and writing the pdtar program which became GNU tar. Outside of the GNU project he founded the FreeS/WAN project, an implementation of IPsec, to promote the encryption of Internet traffic. He sponsored the EFF&#x27;s Deep Crack DES cracker, sponsored the Micropolis city building game based on SimCity, and is a proponent of opportunistic encryption.

Gilmore co-authored the Bootstrap Protocol (RFC 951) with Bill Croft in 1985. The Bootstrap Protocol evolved into DHCP, the method by which Ethernet and wireless networks typically assign devices an IP address.

On October 22, 2021, EFF announced that they had removed Gilmore from the Board following a governance dispute. The details of the dispute were not made public.

On June 23, 2024, Gilmore was selected as a board member of the Free Software Foundation.

== Activism ==
Gilmore owns the domain name toad.com, which is one of the 100 oldest active .com domains. It was registered on August 18, 1987. He runs the mail server at toad.com as an open mail relay. In October 2002, Gilmore&#x27;s ISP, Verio, cut off his Internet access for running an open relay, a violation of Verio&#x27;s terms of service. Many people contend that open relays make it too easy to send spam. Gilmore protests that his mail server was programmed to be essentially useless to spammers and other senders of mass email and he argues that Verio&#x27;s actions constitute censorship. He also notes that his configuration makes it easier for friends who travel to send email, although his critics counter that there are other mechanisms to accommodate people wanting to send email while traveling. The measures Gilmore took to make his server useless to spammers may or may not have helped, considering that in 2002, at least one mass-mailing worm that propagated through open relays — W32.Yaha — had been hard-coded to relay through the toad.com mail server.

Gilmore famously stated of Internet censorship that &quot;The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it&quot;.

He unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of secret regulations regarding travel security policies in &quot;Gilmore v. Gonzales&quot;.

Gilmore is also an advocate for the relaxing of drug laws and has given financial support to Students for Sensible Drug Policy, the Marijuana Policy Project, Erowid, MAPS, Flex Your Rights, and various other organizations seeking to end the war on drugs. He is a member of the boards of directors of MAPS and the Marijuana Policy Project. Until October 2021, he was also a board member of the EFF.

== Affiliations ==
Following the sale of AMPRNet address space in mid-2019, Gilmore, under amateur radio call sign W0GNU, was listed as a board member of Amateur Radio Digital Communications, a non-profit involved in the management of the  resources on behalf of the amateur radio community.

== Honours ==

Gilmore has received the Free Software Foundation&#x27;s Advancement of Free Software 2009 award.

<text>Cygnus Solutions, originally Cygnus Support, was founded in 1989 by John Gilmore, Michael Tiemann and David Henkel-Wallace to provide commercial support for free software. Its tagline was: &quot;Making free software affordable&quot;.

For years, employees of Cygnus Solutions were the maintainers of several key GNU software products, including the GNU Debugger and GNU Binutils (which included the GNU Assembler and Linker). It was also a major contributor to the GCC project and drove the change in the project&#x27;s management from having a single gatekeeper to having an independent committee. Cygnus developed BFD, and used it to help port GNU to many architectures, in a number of cases working under non-disclosure to produce tools used for initial bringup of software for a new chip design.

Cygnus was also the original developer of Cygwin, a POSIX layer and the GNU toolkit port to the Microsoft Windows operating system family, and of eCos, an embedded real-time operating system.

In the 2001 documentary film &quot;Revolution OS&quot;, Tiemann indicates that the name &quot;Cygnus&quot; was chosen from among several names that incorporated the acronym &quot;GNU&quot; such as &quot;magnum&quot;, &quot;wingnut&quot;, and &quot;lugnut&quot;. According to Stan Kelly-Bootle, it was recursively defined as &quot;Cygnus, your GNU Support&quot;.

On November 15, 1999, Cygnus Solutions announced its merger with Red Hat, and it ceased to exist as a separate company in early 2000. , a number of Cygnus employees continue to work for Red Hat, including Tiemann, who serves as Red Hat&#x27;s Vice President of Open Source Affairs, and formerly served as CTO.

<doc id="43311" wikidata="Q41264" url="?curid=43311" title="Johannes Vermeer">
<text>Johannes Vermeer ( , ; ; also known as Jan Vermeer; October 1632 – 15 December 1675) was a Dutch painter who specialized in domestic interior scenes of middle-class life. He is considered one of the greatest painters of the Dutch Golden Age. During his lifetime, he was a moderately successful provincial genre painter, recognized in Delft and The Hague. He produced relatively few paintings, primarily earning his living as an art dealer. He was not wealthy; at his death, his wife was left in debt.

Vermeer worked slowly and with great care, and frequently used very expensive pigments. He is particularly renowned for making masterful use of light in his work. &quot;Almost all his paintings&quot;, Hans Koningsberger wrote, &quot;are apparently set in two smallish rooms in his house in Delft; they show the same furniture and decorations in various arrangements and they often portray the same people, mostly women.&quot;

The modest celebrity he enjoyed during his life gave way to obscurity after his death. He was barely mentioned in Arnold Houbraken&#x27;s major source book on 17th-century Dutch painting (&quot;Grand Theatre of Dutch Painters and Women Artists&quot;, published 1718) and, as a result, was omitted from subsequent surveys of Dutch art for nearly two centuries. In the 19th century, Vermeer was rediscovered by Gustav Friedrich Waagen and Théophile Thoré-Bürger, who published an essay attributing 66 pictures to him, although only 34 paintings are universally attributed to him today. Since that time, Vermeer&#x27;s reputation has grown enormously.

==Pronunciation of name==
In Dutch, &quot;Vermeer&quot; is pronounced , and &quot;Johannes Vermeer&quot; as , with assimilating to the preceding voiceless as . The usual English pronunciation is , with , with a long first vowel, occurring in the UK. is also documented. Another pronunciation, , is attested from the UK.

==Life==

Relatively little was known about Vermeer&#x27;s life until recently. He seems to have been devoted exclusively to his art, living out his life in the city of Delft. Until the 19th century, the only sources of information were a few registers, official documents, and comments by other artists; for this reason, Thoré-Bürger named him &quot;The Sphinx of Delft&quot;. John Michael Montias added details on the family from the city archives of Delft in his &quot;Artists and Artisans in Delft: A Socio-Economic Study of the Seventeenth Century&quot; (1982).

===Youth and heritage===
Johannes Vermeer was baptized within the Reformed Church on 31 October 1632. His mother, Digna Baltens (–1670), was from Antwerp. Digna&#x27;s father, Balthasar Geerts, or Gerrits (born in Antwerp in or around 1573), led an enterprising life in metalworking, and was arrested for counterfeiting. Vermeer&#x27;s father, named Reijnier Janszoon, was a middle-class worker of silk or caffa (a mixture of silk and cotton or wool). He was the son of Jan Reyersz and Cornelia (Neeltge) Goris. As an apprentice in Amsterdam, Reijnier lived on fashionable Sint Antoniesbreestraat, a street with many resident painters at the time. In 1615, Reijnier married Digna. The couple moved to Delft and had a daughter named Gertruy who was baptized in 1620. In 1625, Reijnier was involved in a fight with a soldier named Willem van Bylandt who died from his wounds five months later. Around this time, Reijnier began dealing in paintings. In 1631, he leased an inn, which he called &quot;The Flying Fox&quot;. In 1635, he lived on Voldersgracht 25 or 26. In 1641, he bought a larger inn on the market square, named after the Flemish town &quot;Mechelen&quot;. The acquisition of the inn constituted a considerable financial burden. When Reijnier died in October 1652, Vermeer took over the operation of the family&#x27;s art business.

===Marriage and family===
In April 1653, Johannes Reijniersz Vermeer married a Catholic woman, Catharina Bolnes (Bolenes). The blessing took place in the quiet nearby village of Schipluiden. Vermeer&#x27;s new mother-in-law, Maria Thins, was initially opposed to the marriage as she was significantly wealthier than he, and it was probably she who insisted that Vermeer convert to Catholicism before the marriage on 5 April. The fact that Vermeer&#x27;s father was in considerable debt also did not help in discussions on the marriage. Leonaert Bramer, who was Catholic himself, put in a good word for Vermeer and it was this that led Maria to drop her oppositions. According to art historian Walter Liedtke, Vermeer&#x27;s conversion seems to have been made with conviction. His painting &quot;The Allegory of Faith&quot;, made between 1670 and 1672, placed less emphasis on the artists&#x27; usual naturalistic concerns and more on symbolic religious applications, including the sacrament of the Eucharist. Walter Liedtke, in &quot;Dutch Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art&quot;, suggests that it was made for a learned and devout Catholic patron, perhaps for his &quot;schuilkerk&quot;, or &quot;hidden church&quot;. At some point, the couple moved in with Catharina&#x27;s mother, who lived in a rather spacious house at Oude Langendijk, almost next to a hidden Jesuit church. There Vermeer lived for the rest of his life, producing paintings in the front room on the second floor. His wife gave birth to 15 children, four of whom were buried before being baptized but were registered as &quot;child of Johan Vermeer&quot;. The names of 10 of Vermeer&#x27;s children are known from wills written by relatives: Maertge, Elisabeth, Cornelia, Aleydis, Beatrix, Johannes, Gertruyd, Franciscus, Catharina, and Ignatius. Most of these names are those of saints; the youngest (Ignatius) was likely named after the Ignatius of Loyola.

===Career===

It is unclear where and with whom Vermeer apprenticed as a painter. There is some speculation that Carel Fabritius may have been his teacher, based upon a controversial interpretation of a text written in 1668 by printer Arnold Bon. Art historians have found no hard evidence to support this. Local authority Leonaert Bramer acted as a friend, but his style of painting is rather different from Vermeer&#x27;s. Liedtke suggests that Vermeer taught himself using information from one of his father&#x27;s connections. Some scholars think that Vermeer was trained under Catholic painter Abraham Bloemaert. Vermeer&#x27;s style is similar to that of some of the Utrecht Caravaggists, whose works are depicted as paintings-within-paintings in the backgrounds of several of his compositions.
On 29 December 1653, Vermeer became a member of the Guild of Saint Luke, a trade association for painters. The guild&#x27;s records make clear that Vermeer did not pay the usual admission fee. It was a year of plague, war, and economic crisis; Vermeer was not alone in experiencing difficult financial circumstances. In 1654, a terrible explosion, known as the Delft Thunderclap, occurred at a gunpowder store and destroyed a large section of the city. Pieter van Ruijven and his wife, Maria de Knuijt, were Vermeer&#x27;s patrons for the better part of the artist&#x27;s career. In 2023, Maria de Knuijt was identified by the curators of the 2023 exhibition of Vermeer&#x27;s works at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam as the main patron because of her long-standing and supportive relationship with the artist. It seems that Vermeer turned for inspiration to the art of the fijnschilders from Leiden. Vermeer was responding to the market of Gerard Dou&#x27;s paintings, who sold his paintings for exorbitant prices. Dou may have influenced Pieter de Hooch and Gabriel Metsu too. Vermeer also charged higher than average prices for his work, most of which were purchased by an unknown collector.

The influence of Johannes Vermeer on Metsu is unmistakable: the light from the left, the marble floor. (Adriaan Waiboer, however, suggests that Metsu requires more emotional involvement of the viewer.) Vermeer probably competed also with Nicolaes Maes, who produced genre works in a similar style. In 1662, Vermeer was elected head of the guild and was reelected in 1663, 1670, and 1671, evidence that he (like Bramer) was considered an established craftsman among his peers. Vermeer worked slowly, probably producing three paintings a year on order. Balthasar de Monconys visited him in 1663 to see some of his work, but Vermeer had no paintings to show. The diplomat and the two French clergymen who accompanied him were sent to Hendrick van Buyten, a baker who had a couple of Vermeer&#x27;s paintings as collateral.

In 1671, Gerrit van Uylenburgh organized the auction of Gerrit Reynst&#x27;s collection and offered 13 paintings and some sculptures to Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. Frederick accused them of being counterfeits and sent 12 back on the advice of Hendrick Fromantiou. Van Uylenburg then organized a counter-assessment, asking a total of 35 painters to pronounce on their authenticity, including Jan Lievens, Melchior de Hondecoeter, Gerbrand van den Eeckhout, and Johannes Vermeer.

===Wars and death===

In 1672, a severe economic downturn known as the Rampjaar struck the Dutch Republic, after French troops led by Louis XIV invaded the country from the south during the Franco-Dutch War. At the same time, troops from Münster and Cologne invaded the country from the east, causing more destruction. Many people panicked; courts, theaters, shops and schools were closed. Vermeer&#x27;s sale of that year was his last. Five years passed before circumstances improved. In 1674, Vermeer was listed as a member of the civic guards. In the summer of 1675, Vermeer borrowed 1,000 guilders in Amsterdam from Jacob Romboutsz (grandfather of Hendrick Sorgh), an Amsterdam silk trader, using his mother-in-law&#x27;s property as a surety.

On 15 December 1675, Vermeer died after a short illness. He was 43 years old. He was buried in the Protestant Old Church on 15 December 1675. In a petition to her creditors, Catharina Bolnes attributed her husband&#x27;s death to the stress of financial pressures, and described his death as follows: 

... during the ruinous war with France he not only was unable to sell any of his art but also, to his great detriment, was left sitting with the paintings of other masters that he was dealing in. As a result and owing to the great burden of his children having no means of his own, he lapsed into such decay and decadence, which he had so taken to heart that, as if he had fallen into a frenzy, in a day and a half he went from being healthy to being dead.

Catharina describes how the collapse of the art market had damaged Vermeer&#x27;s business as both a painter and an art dealer. She had to raise 11 children and therefore asked the High Court to relieve her of debts owed to Vermeer&#x27;s creditors. Pioneering Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who worked for the city council as a surveyor, was appointed trustee. The house had eight rooms on the first floor, the contents of which were listed in an inventory taken a few months after Vermeer&#x27;s death. In his studio, there were two chairs, two painter&#x27;s easels, three palettes, 10 canvases, a desk, an oak pull table, a small wooden cupboard with drawers, and &quot;rummage not worthy being itemized&quot;. Nineteen of Vermeer&#x27;s paintings were bequeathed to Catharina and her mother. The widow sold two more paintings to Hendrick van Buyten to pay off a substantial debt.

Vermeer had been a respected artist in Delft, but he was almost unknown outside his hometown. A local patron named Pieter van Ruijven had purchased much of his output, which kept Vermeer afloat financially but reduced the possibility of his fame spreading. Several factors contributed to his limited body of work. Vermeer never had any pupils, though one scholar has suggested that Vermeer taught his eldest daughter Maria to paint. Additionally, his family obligations with so many children may have taken up much of his time, as would acting as both an art dealer and inn-keeper in running the family businesses. His time spent serving as head of the guild and his extraordinary precision as a painter may have also limited his output.

==Style==

Vermeer may have first executed his paintings tonally like most painters of his time, using either monochrome shades of grey (&quot;grisaille&quot;) or a limited palette of browns and greys (&quot;dead coloring&quot;), over which he would apply more saturated colors (reds, yellows, and blues) in the form of transparent glazes. No drawings have been positively attributed to Vermeer, and his paintings offer few clues to preparatory methods.

There is no other 17th-century artist who employed the exorbitantly expensive pigment ultramarine (derived from natural lapis lazuli) either so lavishly or so early in his career. Vermeer used this pigment in not just elements that are naturally of this colour; he also used it early in a work, beneath subsequent earth colours such as umber and ochre, to subtly tint their shade. This working method most probably was inspired by Vermeer&#x27;s understanding of Leonardo&#x27;s observations that the surface of every object partakes of the colour of the adjacent object.

An example of Vermeer using ultramarine as an underpaint is in &quot;The Girl with the Wine Glass&quot;. The shadows of the red satin dress are underpainted in natural ultramarine, and, owing to this underlying blue paint layer, the red lake and vermilion mixture applied over it acquires a slightly purple, cool and crisp appearance.

Even after Vermeer&#x27;s evident financial breakdown following the so-called rampjaar (year of disaster) in 1672, he continued to employ natural ultramarine generously, such as in &quot;Lady Seated at a Virginal&quot;. This could suggest that Vermeer was supplied with materials by a collector and would coincide with John Michael Montias&#x27; theory that Pieter van Ruijven was Vermeer&#x27;s patron.

Vermeer&#x27;s works are largely genre pieces and portraits, with the exception of two cityscapes and two allegories. His subjects offer a cross-section of seventeenth-century Dutch society, ranging from the portrayal of a simple milkmaid at work, to the luxury and splendour of rich notables and merchantmen in their roomy houses. Besides these subjects, religious, poetical, musical, and scientific comments can also be found in his work.

===Painting materials===
One aspect of his meticulous painting technique was Vermeer&#x27;s choice of pigments. He is best known for his frequent use of the very expensive ultramarine (&quot;The Milkmaid&quot;) and also lead-tin-yellow (&quot;A Lady Writing a Letter&quot;), madder lake (&quot;Christ in the House of Martha and Mary&quot;), and vermilion. He also painted with ochres, bone black and azurite. The claim that he used Indian yellow in &quot;Woman Holding a Balance&quot; has been disproven by pigment analysis.

In Vermeer&#x27;s oeuvre, only about 20 pigments have been detected. Of these, seven principal pigments that Vermeer commonly employed are lead white, yellow ochre, vermilion, madder lake, green earth, raw umber, and ivory or bone black.

=== Theories of mechanical aid ===

Vermeer&#x27;s painting techniques have long been a source of debate, given their almost photorealistic attention to detail, despite Vermeer&#x27;s having had no formal training and despite only limited evidence that Vermeer had created any preparatory sketches or traces for his paintings.

In 2001, British artist David Hockney published the book &quot;Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters&quot;, in which he argued that Vermeer (among other Renaissance and Baroque artists including Hans Holbein and Diego Velázquez) used optics to achieve precise positioning in their compositions, and specifically some combination of curved mirrors, camera obscura, and camera lucida. This became known as the Hockney–Falco thesis, named after Hockney and Charles M. Falco, another proponent of the theory.

Philip Steadman published the book &quot;Vermeer&#x27;s Camera: Uncovering the Truth behind the Masterpieces&quot; in 2001, in which Steadman specifically claimed that Vermeer had used a camera obscura to create his paintings. Steadman noted that many of Vermeer&#x27;s paintings had been painted in the same room, and he found six of Vermeer&#x27;s paintings that would be precisely the right size if they had been painted from inside a camera obscura in the room&#x27;s back wall.

Supporters of these theories have pointed to evidence in some of Vermeer&#x27;s paintings, such as the often-discussed sparkling pearly highlights in Vermeer&#x27;s paintings, which they argue are the result of the primitive lens of a camera obscura producing halation. It was also postulated that a camera obscura was the mechanical cause of the &quot;exaggerated&quot; perspective seen in &quot;The Music Lesson&quot; (London, Royal Collection).

In 2008, American entrepreneur and inventor Tim Jenison developed the theory that Vermeer had used a camera obscura along with a &quot;comparator mirror&quot;, which is similar in concept to a camera lucida but much simpler and makes it easy to match colour values. Jenison later modified the theory to simply involve a concave mirror and a comparator mirror. He spent the next five years testing his theory by re-creating &quot;The Music Lesson&quot; himself using these tools, a process captured in the 2013 documentary film &quot;Tim&#x27;s Vermeer&quot;.

Several points were brought out by Jenison in support of this technique. First was Vermeer&#x27;s hyper-accurate rendition of light falloff along the wall. Neurobiologist Colin Blakemore, in an interview with Jenison, notes that human vision cannot process information about the absolute brightness of a scene. Another was the addition of several highlights and outlines consistent with matching the effects of chromatic aberration, particularly noticeable in primitive optics. Last, and perhaps most telling, is a noticeable curvature in the original painting&#x27;s rendition of the scrollwork on the virginal. This effect matched Jenison&#x27;s technique precisely, caused by exactly duplicating the view as seen from a curved mirror.

This theory remains disputed. There is no historical evidence regarding Vermeer&#x27;s interest in optics, and the detailed inventory of the artist&#x27;s belongings drawn up after his death includes no camera obscura or any similar device. However, Vermeer was in close connection with pioneer lens maker Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who was his executor after death.

==Works==

It is believed Vermeer produced a total of fewer than 50 paintings, of which 34 have survived. Only three Vermeer paintings were dated by the artist: &quot;The Procuress&quot; (1656; Gemäldegalerie, Dresden); &quot;The Astronomer&quot; (1668; Musée du Louvre, Paris); and &quot;The Geographer&quot; (1669; Städelsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt).

Vermeer&#x27;s mother-in-law, Maria Thins, owned Dirck van Baburen&#x27;s 1622 oil on canvas &quot;The Procuress&quot; (or a copy of it), which appears in the background of two of Vermeer&#x27;s paintings. The same subject was also painted by Vermeer. Almost all of Vermeer&#x27;s paintings are of contemporary subjects in a smaller format, with a cooler palette dominated by blues, yellows, and grays.Vermeer painted multiple artworks portraying a pure profile like the painting &quot;Woman with a Pearl Necklace&quot;, which was uncommon in Dutch art at the time. Practically all of his surviving works belong to this period, usually domestic interiors with one or two figures lit by a window on the left. They are characterized by a sense of compositional balance and spatial order, unified by a pearly light. Mundane domestic or recreational activities are imbued with a poetic timelessness (e.g., &quot;Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window&quot;, Dresden, Gemäldegalerie). Vermeer&#x27;s two townscapes have also been attributed to this period: &quot;View of Delft&quot; (The Hague, Mauritshuis) and &quot;The Little Street&quot; (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum).

A few of his paintings show a certain hardening of manner and are generally thought to represent his late works. From this period come &quot;The Allegory of Faith&quot; (c. 1670; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and &quot;The Love Letter&quot; (c. 1670; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam).

==Legacy==

Originally, Vermeer&#x27;s works were largely overlooked by art historians for two centuries after his death. A select number of connoisseurs in the Netherlands did appreciate his work, yet even so, many of his works were attributed to then better-known artists such as Metsu or Mieris. The Delft master&#x27;s modern rediscovery began about 1860, when German museum director Gustav Waagen saw &quot;The Art of Painting&quot; in the Czernin gallery in Vienna and recognized the work as a Vermeer, though it was attributed to Pieter de Hooch at that time. Research by Théophile Thoré-Bürger culminated in the publication of his catalogue raisonné of Vermeer&#x27;s works in the &quot;Gazette des Beaux-Arts&quot; in 1866. Thoré-Bürger&#x27;s catalogue drew international attention to Vermeer and listed more than 70 works by him, including many that Thoré-Bürger regarded as uncertain.

Upon the rediscovery of Vermeer&#x27;s work, several prominent Dutch artists modelled their style on his work, including Simon Duiker. Other artists who were inspired by Vermeer include Danish painter Wilhelm Hammershoi and American Thomas Wilmer Dewing. In the 20th century, Vermeer&#x27;s admirers included Salvador Dalí, who painted his own version of &quot;The Lacemaker&quot; (on commission from collector Robert Lehman) and pitted large copies of the original against a rhinoceros in some surrealist experiments. Dali also celebrated the master in &quot;The Ghost of Vermeer of Delft Which Can Be Used As a Table&quot;, 1934.

Han van Meegeren was a 20th-century Dutch painter who worked in the classical tradition. He became a master forger, motivated by a blend of aesthetic and financial reasons, creating and selling many new &quot;Vermeers&quot; before turning himself in for forgery to avoid being charged with capital treason for collaboration with the Nazis, specifically in selling what had been believed to be original artwork to the Nazis.

On the evening of 23 September 1971, a 21-year-old hotel waiter, Mario Pierre Roymans, stole Vermeer&#x27;s &quot;Love Letter&quot; from the Fine Arts Palace in Brussels, where it was on loan from the Rijksmuseum for the exhibition &quot;Rembrandt and his Age&quot;.

To mark the 26th anniversary of the opening of an exhibition at Washington, DC&#x27;s National Gallery of Art featuring Vermeer&#x27;s work, Google honored Vermeer with a Google Doodle on 12 November 2021.

A 2023 exhibition at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam featured 28 of Vermeer&#x27;s works, the most ever shown together. More than 650,000 people visited the exhibition, making it the museum&#x27;s most visited exhibition. Coinciding with the exhibition, the documentary film &quot;Close to Vermeer&quot; was released the same year. The film followed curators Gregor J. M. Weber and Pieter Roelofs as they sought loans of Vermeer&#x27;s artwork from museums around the world. Also released in 2023 was another movie about the exhibition at the Rijkmuseum: &quot;Vermeer: The Greatest Exhibition&quot;. (External links to both movies are below.)

==In popular culture==
Vermeer&#x27;s reputation and works have been featured in both literature and in films. Tracy Chevalier&#x27;s novel &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; (1999) and the 2003 film of the same name present a fictional account of Vermeer&#x27;s creation of the famous painting and his relationship with the equally fictional model.

Many artists are inspired by the famous painter. For example, culinary photographer Aimee Twigger draws on Vermeer&#x27;s chiaroscuro for her gustatory journeys through recipes.

<text>Cimarron is a novel by Edna Ferber, published in April 1930 and based on development in Oklahoma after the Land Rush. The book was adapted into a critically acclaimed film of the same name, released in 1931 through RKO Pictures. The story was again adapted for the screen by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and was released in 1960, to meager success.

==Background==

===The Land Rush===

The Oklahoma Land Rush (also called the Oklahoma Land Race and Cherokee Strip Land Run) plays a pivotal role in both the novel and film adaptations. &quot;Manifest destiny&quot; and the desperation of the settlers involved in the rush provides the opening drama and sets the stage for the twists and turns in the book. Every settler is desperate to stake his claim on the best piece of land (near water).

&quot;Cimarron&quot; involves two land runs. The first, for the Unassigned Lands, occurred on April 22, 1889. The second, for the Cherokee Outlet (commonly called the Cherokee Strip) occurred in 1893. The piece of land in question had been allotted to the Cherokee Nation as part of the 1828 Treaty of New Echota, while the rest of the Oklahoma Territory had been opened to settlers. As commerce grew across the area of Kansas and Oklahoma, cattlemen became increasingly annoyed by the presence of the Cherokee on prime land that they wanted to use to drive cattle from northern ranches to Texas. Some of this annoyance with the Native people can be attributed to the decision made by the Cherokees to side with the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. In the 1880s, the government attempted to lease the land for cattle ranching, but the Native Americans refused. Eventually, the Cherokee people did sell the land to the government.

Throughout the remaining years of the 1880s various cattle associations and ranches fought over the land. Disputes even turned deadly, as large cattle companies and small ranchers both claimed the land as their own. This eventually led to a ban on cattle ranching in the area, and in 1893 the land, 58 miles (93 km) wide by 225 miles (362 km) long, was opened to homesteaders. The land was divided into 42,000 claims, and each homesteader had to literally stake (put a stake with a white flag attached) their claim, and pick up a certificate back at the starting place. Nearly 100,000 people arrived for the rush, and over half of them would be sent back home after the day was through.

==Novel==
&quot;Cimarron&quot; derives its name from the Cimarron Territory. The Cimarron Territory was an unrecognized name for the No Man&#x27;s Land, an unsettled area of the West and Midwest, especially lands once inhabited by Native American tribes such as the Cherokee and Sioux. In 1886 the government declared such lands open to settlement. At the time of the novel&#x27;s opening, Oklahoma is one such &quot;Cimarron Territory,&quot; though in actuality the historical setting of the novel is somewhere in the Cherokee Outlet, also known as the Cherokee Strip, and probably the city of Guthrie, Oklahoma.

The novel is set in the Oklahoma of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It follows the lives of Yancey and Sabra Cravat, beginning with Yancey&#x27;s tale of his participation in the 1893 land rush. They emigrate from Wichita, Kansas, to the fictional town of Osage, Oklahoma with their son Cim and—unknowingly—a black boy named Isaiah. In Osage, the Cravats print their newspaper, the &quot;Oklahoma Wigwam&quot;, and build their fortune amongst Indian disputes, outlaws, and the discovery of oil in Oklahoma.

Upon its publication, &quot;Cimarron&quot; was a sensation in America and came to epitomize an era in American history. It was the best selling novel of 1930, as it provided readers an outlet to escape their present suffering in the Great Depression. This novel became Ferber&#x27;s third successful novel and paved the way for many more Ferber-penned historical epics, and it was published as an Armed Services Edition during WWII.

While it became seen as a triumphant feminist story detailing Sabra Cravat&#x27;s growth from a traditional American housewife into a successful leader and politician, Ferber has stated in her autobiography, &quot;A Peculiar Treasure&quot;, that the novel was originally intended as a satirical criticism of American womanhood and American sentimentality. Throughout the novel, Sabra&#x27;s practice of imperial domesticity can be seen in her attempts to &quot;civilize&quot; Native Americans by forcing them to adopt white values, and her fixation on expanding her own sphere of influence, which as a woman, was traditionally her home.

The character of Yancey Cravat is based on Temple Lea Houston, last child of Texas icon Sam Houston. Temple Houston was a brilliant trial lawyer known for his flamboyant courtroom theatrics. He was also a competent gunfighter who killed at least one man in a stand-up shootout.

==Films==

===1931 film===
Hollywood had long since taken notice of writer Edna Ferber&#x27;s talents. The first Ferber adaptation came in 1918 with the silent &quot;Our Mrs. McChesney&quot;, based on a play Ferber had written. &quot;So Big&quot; was released as a film the same year it was published as a novel, and adaptations of &quot;Gigolo&quot; and &quot;Show Boat&quot; also followed. With the advent of sound, Ferber adaptations had even more promise. Immediately following its publication, many production companies courted Ferber. Ferber ended up selling the film rights to RKO Pictures in 1930 for a record $125,000 (a large sum even for today).

Despite America being in the depths of the Depression, RKO immediately prepared for a big-budget picture, investing more than $1.5 million into Ferber&#x27;s novel &quot;Cimarron&quot;. Director Wesley Ruggles would direct stars Richard Dix and Irene Dunne with a script written by Howard Estabrook. Filming began in the summer of 1930 at the Jasmin Quinn Ranch outside of Los Angeles, California. The film was a massive production, especially the land rush scenes, which recalled the epic scenes of &quot;Intolerance&quot; some fifteen years earlier. More than 5,000 extras, twenty-eight cameramen, and numerous camera assistants and photographers were used to capture scenes of wagons racing across grassy hills and prairies. Cinematographer Edward Cronjager spent overtime planning out every scene in accordance to Ferber&#x27;s descriptions.

The film was premiered in New York City on January 26, 1931, to much praise, and a Los Angeles premiere followed on February 6. Three days later the film was released to theaters throughout the nation. Despite being a critical success, the high budget and ongoing Great Depression combined against the film. While it was a commercial success in line with other films of the day, RKO could not recoup their investment in the film.

===1960 film===

The remake of &quot;Cimarron&quot; included many changes from the Ferber novel and especially from the 1931 film. With the Civil Rights Movement gaining momentum, the script, written by Arnold Schulman, took a kinder approach to Native Americans. Schulman gave the people more dignity and recognized that they were losing land that was rightfully theirs through the 1893 land rush that was the film&#x27;s centerpiece. He also introduced several minor characters, such as journalist Sam Pegler (Robert Keith) and Wes Jennings (Vic Morrow), a prominent member of Cherokee Kid&#x27;s (Russ Tamblyn) gang.

In 1961 the film was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color (art directors George W. Davis and Addison Hehr) and Best Sound, but failed to win either. &quot;Cimarron&quot; marked the end of the Ferber adaptations.

<doc id="43313" wikidata="Q932629" url="?curid=43313" title="Halloween documents">
<text>The Halloween documents comprise a series of confidential Microsoft memoranda on potential strategies relating to free software, open-source software, and to Linux in particular, and a series of media responses to these memoranda. Both the leaked documents and the responses were published by open-source software advocate Eric S. Raymond in 1998.

The documents are associated with Halloween because many of them were originally leaked close to October 31 in different years.

==Overview==
The first Halloween document, requested by senior vice-president Jim Allchin for the attention of senior vice-president Paul Maritz and written by Microsoft program manager Vinod Valloppillil, was leaked to Eric Raymond in October 1998, who immediately published an annotated version on his web site. The document contained references to a second memorandum specifically dealing with Linux, and that document, authored by Vinod Valloppillil and Josh Cohen at Microsoft, was also obtained, annotated and published by Raymond. Microsoft later acknowledged the documents&#x27; authenticity. Marked &quot;Microsoft confidential&quot;, the documents identified open-source software, and in particular the Linux operating system, as a major threat to Microsoft&#x27;s domination of the software industry, and suggested tactics Microsoft could use to disrupt the progress of open-source software.

These documents acknowledged that free software products such as Linux were technologically competitive with some of Microsoft&#x27;s products, and set out a strategy to combat them. These views contradicted Microsoft&#x27;s public pronouncements on the subject.

Since the publication of the two original documents, other Microsoft memoranda on related topics have also been leaked and published.

==List of documents==
The documents are from a variety of sources. Only some are leaked internal memos (documents I, II, VII, VIII, and X). One is a public statement (document III). The others are responses by Eric Raymond to various columns, news articles, and other works.

===Documents I and II===
These are leaked reports for Microsoft&#x27;s own use, both written by Vinod Valloppillil, a program manager at Microsoft.

Document I provides a detailed introduction to the concepts behind open source software and its possible impact on Microsoft products and services. It outlines the strengths and weaknesses of open source software. Document II describes the basic architecture of the Linux system, and its relation to Unix and Windows NT.

Document I revealed that &quot;FUD&quot; (spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt) was a traditional Microsoft marketing strategy, acknowledged and understood internally. Examples of Microsoft&#x27;s FUD tactics are announcing nonexistent products or spreading rumors that competing products will crash Windows. Raymond suggests that the documents show that while Microsoft may have been dismissive of open source software in public, it privately considers it a serious competitor.

In discussing ways of competing with open source, Document I suggests that one reason that open source projects had been able to enter the server market is the market&#x27;s use of standardized protocols. The document then suggests that this can be stopped by &quot;extending these protocols and developing new protocols&quot; and &quot;de-commoditiz[ing] protocols &amp; applications&quot;. This policy has been internally nicknamed &quot;embrace, extend, extinguish&quot;. Document I also suggests that open source software &quot;is long-term credible ... FUD tactics can not be used to combat it&quot;, and &quot;Recent case studies (the Internet) provide very dramatic evidence ... that commercial quality can be achieved / exceeded by OSS projects.&quot;

Documents I and II were filed as evidence on January 16, 2007, in the case of &quot;Comes v. Microsoft&quot;.

===Document III===
The statement from Aurelia van den Berg, the Press and Public Relations manager of Microsoft Netherlands, puts forward Microsoft&#x27;s view on the first two documents. It says that the documents are not an &quot;official position&quot;, but that &quot;it is routine and appropriate&quot; to research competitors. This statement is only a brief response, but many points were later incorporated into an official response from Microsoft.

===Document VII===
This document is a summary of the results of a survey of developers and IT managers, carried out by Microsoft, describing reactions to Microsoft&#x27;s shared-source program. Eric Raymond provides commentary suggesting ways that the open-source community can promote itself based on the results of the survey. The results show favorable responses about both open-source and shared-source principles. It also describes low total cost of ownership (TCO) as a major reason for Linux adoption, in contradiction to many documents released by the company suggesting that Windows has a lower TCO than Linux solutions.

===Document VIII===
&quot;OSS and Government&quot;, aka &quot;Halloween VIII: Doing the Damage-Control Dance&quot;, is a memo from Group Vice President of Worldwide Sales, Orlando Ayala, to general managers of Microsoft regional subsidiaries. It describes the availability of support from Microsoft corporate for regional sales personnel facing competition from Linux in government markets.

===Document X===
An e-mail from consultant Mike Anderer to SCO Group&#x27;s Chris Sontag, also known as &quot;Halloween X: Follow The Money&quot;. The document describes, among other points, Microsoft&#x27;s channeling of $86 million (equivalent to $ million in ) to SCO.

<text>This is a list of [[free and open-source software]] (FOSS) [[Package manager|packages]], computer software licensed under free software licenses and open-source licenses. Software that fits the Free Software Definition may be more appropriately called free software; the GNU project in particular objects to their works being referred to as open-source. For more information about the philosophical background for open-source software, see free software movement and Open Source Initiative. However, nearly all software meeting the Free Software Definition also meets &quot;the Open Source Definition&quot; and vice versa. A small fraction of the software that meets either definition is listed here.

<text>This is a list of mail server software: mail transfer agents, mail delivery agents, and other computer software which provide e-mail.
==Product statistics==
All such figures are necessarily estimates because data about mail server share is difficult to obtain; there are few reliable primary sources—and no agreed methodologies for its collection.

Surveys probing Internet-exposed systems typically attempt to identify systems via their banner, or other identifying features. , Postfix and exim appeared to be the overwhelming leaders in mail server types, with greater than 92% share between them, having come to prominence before 2010 in each case. While such methods are effective at identifying mail server share for receiving systems, most large-scale sending environments are not listening for traffic on the public internet and will not be counted using such methodologies.

<text>An open mail relay is a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server configured in such a way that it allows anyone on the Internet to send e-mail through it, not just mail destined to or originating from known users. This used to be the default configuration in many mail servers; indeed, it was the way the Internet was initially set up, but open mail relays have become unpopular because of their exploitation by spammers and worms. Many relays were closed, or were placed on blacklists by other servers.

== History and technology ==
Until the 1990s, mail servers were commonly intentionally configured as open relays; in fact, this was frequently the installation default setting. The traditional store and forward method of relaying e-mail to its destination required that it was passed from computer to computer (through and beyond the Internet) via modems on telephone lines. For many early networks, such as UUCPNET, FidoNet and BITNET, lists of machines that were open relays were a core part of those networks. Filtering and speed of e-mail delivery were not priorities at that time and in any case the government and educational servers that were initially on the Internet were covered by a federal edict forbidding the transfer of commercial messages.

== Abuse by spammers ==
In the mid-1990s, with the rise of spamming, spammers resorted to re-routing their e-mail through third party e-mail servers to avoid detection and to exploit the additional resources of these open relay servers. Spammers would send one e-mail to the open relay and (effectively) include a large blind carbon copy list, then the open relay would relay that spam to the entire list. While this greatly reduced the bandwidth requirements for spammers at a time when Internet connections were limited, it forced each spam to be an exact copy and thus easier to detect. After abuse by spammers became widespread, operating an open relay came to be frowned upon among the majority of Internet server administrators and other prominent users. Open relays are recommended against in RFC 2505 and RFC 5321 (which defines SMTP). The exact copy nature of spam using open relays made it easy to create bulk e-mail detection systems such as Vipul&#x27;s Razor and the Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse. To counter this, spammers were forced to switch to using hash busters to make them less effective and the advantage of using open relays was removed since every copy of spam was &quot;unique&quot; and had to be sent individually.

Since open mail relays make no effort to authenticate the sender of an e-mail, open mail relays are vulnerable to address spoofing.

== Anti-spam efforts ==
Many Internet service providers use Domain Name System-based Blackhole Lists (DNSBL) to disallow mail from open relays. Once a mail server is detected or reported that allows third parties to send mail through them, they will be added to one or more such lists, and other e-mail servers using those lists will reject any mail coming from those sites. The relay need not actually be used for sending spam to be blacklisted; instead, it may be blacklisted after a simple test that just confirms open access.

This trend reduced the percentage of mail senders that were open relays from over 90% down to well under 1% over several years. This led spammers to adopt other techniques, such as the use of botnets of zombie computers to send spam.

One consequence of the new unacceptability of open relays was an inconvenience for some end users and certain Internet service providers. To allow customers to use their e-mail addresses at Internet locations other than the company&#x27;s systems (such as at school or work), many mail sites explicitly allowed open relaying so that customers could send e-mail via the ISP from any location. Once open relay became unacceptable because of abuse (and unusable because of blocking of open relays), ISPs and other sites had to adopt new protocols to allow remote users to send mail. These include smart hosts, SMTP-AUTH, POP before SMTP, and the use of virtual private networks (VPNs). The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has written a best current practices covering Email Submission Operations in RFC 5068.

Note that the above only becomes an issue if the user wishes to (or has to) continue to send e-mail remotely, using the &quot;same&quot; SMTP server which they were previously accessing locally. If they have valid access to some &quot;other&quot; SMTP server from their new, remote location, then they will typically be able to use that new server to send e-mails as if from their old address, even when this server is properly secured. (Although this may involve some reconfiguration of the user&#x27;s email client which may not be entirely straightforward.)

The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 makes it illegal to send spam through an open relay in the United States, but makes no provision on their use for personal e-mail or their operation in general; the effectiveness of the act has been questioned.

== Modern-day proponents ==
The most famous open mail relay operating today is probably that of John Gilmore, who argues that running an open relay is a freedom of speech issue. His server is included on many open relay blacklists (many of which are generated by &quot;automatic detection&quot;, that is, by anti-spam blacklisters sending an (unsolicited) test e-mail to other servers to see if they will be relayed). These measures cause much of his outgoing e-mail to be blocked. Along with his further deliberate configuration of the server, his open relay enables people to send e-mail without their IP address being directly visible to the recipient and thereby send e-mail anonymously. In 2002, his open relay, along with 24 others, was used by a computer worm to propagate itself.

John Gilmore and other open relay proponents declare that they do not support spam and spamming, but see bigger threat in attempts to limit Web capabilities that may block evolution of the new, next generation technologies. They compare the network communication restrictions with restrictions that some phone companies tried to place on their lines in the past, preventing transferring of computer data rather than speech.

== Closing relays ==
In order not to be considered &quot;open&quot;, an e-mail relay should be secure and configured to accept and forward only the following messages (details will vary from system to system — in particular, further restrictions may well apply):

* Messages from local IP addresses to local mailboxes
* Messages from local IP addresses to non-local mailboxes
* Messages from non-local IP addresses to local mailboxes
* Messages from clients that are authenticated and authorized

In particular, a properly secured SMTP mail relay should not accept and forward arbitrary e-mails from non-local IP addresses to non-local mailboxes by an unauthenticated or unauthorized user.

In general, any other rules an administrator chooses to enforce (for instance, based on what an e-mail gives as its own envelope from address) must be in addition to, rather than instead of, the above. If not, the relay is still effectively open (for instance, by the above rules): it is easy to forge e-mail header and envelope information, it is considerably harder to successfully forge an IP address in a TCP/IP transaction because of the three-way handshake that occurs as a connection is started.

Open relays have also resulted from security flaws in software, rather than misconfiguration by system administrators. In these cases, security patches need to be applied to close the relay.

Internet initiatives to close open relays have ultimately missed their intended purpose, because spammers have created distributed botnets of zombie computers that contain malware with mail relaying capability. The number of clients under spammers&#x27; control is now so great that previous anti-spam countermeasures that focused on closing open relays are no longer effective.

<text>William Warren Tunnicliffe (April 22, 1922 – September 12, 1996) is credited by Charles Goldfarb as being the first person (1967) to articulate the idea of separating the definition of formatting from the structure of content in electronic documents (separation of presentation and content).

In September 1967, during a meeting at the Canadian Government Printing Office, Tunnicliffe gave a presentation on the separation of information content of documents from their format. In the 1970s, Tunnicliffe led the development of a standard called &quot;GenCode&quot; for the publishing industry. He served as the first chair of the International Organization for Standardization committee that developed the first international standard for markup languages, ISO 8879.

Tunnicliffe was a member and former chairman of the Printing Industries of America, and held the rank of captain in the US Navy and Navy Reserves until 1982.

<text>In probability theory, a probability space or a probability triple formula_1 is a mathematical construct that provides a formal model of a random process or &quot;experiment&quot;. For example, one can define a probability space which models the throwing of a .

A probability space consists of three elements:
# A &quot;sample space&quot;, formula_2, which is the set of all possible outcomes of a random process under consideration.
# An event space, formula_3, which is a set of events, where an event is a subset of outcomes in the sample space.
# A &quot;probability function&quot;, formula_4, which assigns, to each event in the event space, a probability, which is a number between 0 and 1 (inclusive).

In order to provide a model of probability, these elements must satisfy probability axioms.

In the example of the throw of a standard die,

# The sample space formula_2 is typically the set formula_6 where each element in the set is a label which represents the outcome of the die landing on that label. For example, formula_7 represents the outcome that the die lands on 1.
# The event space formula_3 could be the set of all subsets of the sample space, which would then contain simple events such as formula_9 (&quot;the die lands on 5&quot;), as well as complex events such as formula_10 (&quot;the die lands on an even number&quot;).
# The probability function formula_4 would then map each event to the number of outcomes in that event divided by 6 – so for example, formula_9 would be mapped to formula_13, and formula_10 would be mapped to formula_15.

When an experiment is conducted, it results in exactly one outcome formula_16 from the sample space formula_2. All the events in the event space formula_3 that contain the selected outcome formula_16 are said to &quot;have occurred&quot;. The probability function formula_4 must be so defined that if the experiment were repeated arbitrarily many times, the number of occurrences of each event as a fraction of the total number of experiments, will most likely tend towards the probability assigned to that event.

The Soviet mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov introduced the notion of a probability space and the axioms of probability in the 1930s. In modern probability theory, there are alternative approaches for axiomatization, such as the algebra of random variables.

== Introduction ==

A probability space is a mathematical triplet formula_1 that presents a model for a particular class of real-world situations. As with other models, its author ultimately defines which elements formula_2, formula_3, and formula_4 will contain.
* The sample space formula_2 is the set of all possible outcomes. An outcome is the result of a single execution of the model. Outcomes may be states of nature, possibilities, experimental results and the like. Every instance of the real-world situation (or run of the experiment) must produce exactly one outcome. If outcomes of different runs of an experiment differ in any way that matters, they are distinct outcomes. Which differences matter depends on the kind of analysis we want to do. This leads to different choices of sample space.
* The σ-algebra formula_3 is a collection of all the events we would like to consider. This collection may or may not include each of the elementary events. Here, an &quot;event&quot; is a set of zero or more outcomes; that is, a subset of the sample space. An event is considered to have &quot;happened&quot; during an experiment when the outcome of the latter is an element of the event. Since the same outcome may be a member of many events, it is possible for many events to have happened given a single outcome. For example, when the trial consists of throwing two dice, the set of all outcomes with a sum of 7 pips may constitute an event, whereas outcomes with an odd number of pips may constitute another event. If the outcome is the element of the elementary event of two pips on the first die and five on the second, then both of the events, &quot;7 pips&quot; and &quot;odd number of pips&quot;, are said to have happened.
* The probability measure formula_4 is a set function returning an event&#x27;s probability. A probability is a real number between zero (impossible events have probability zero, though probability-zero events are not necessarily impossible) and one (the event happens almost surely, with almost total certainty). Thus formula_4 is a function formula_29 The probability measure function must satisfy two simple requirements: First, the probability of a countable union of mutually exclusive events must be equal to the countable sum of the probabilities of each of these events. For example, the probability of the union of the mutually exclusive events formula_30 and formula_31 in the random experiment of one coin toss, formula_32, is the sum of probability for formula_30 and the probability for formula_31, formula_35. Second, the probability of the sample space formula_2 must be equal to 1 (which accounts for the fact that, given an execution of the model, some outcome must occur). In the previous example the probability of the set of outcomes formula_37 must be equal to one, because it is entirely certain that the outcome will be either formula_30 or formula_31 (the model neglects any other possibility) in a single coin toss.

Not every subset of the sample space formula_2 must necessarily be considered an event: some of the subsets are simply not of interest, others cannot be &quot;measured&quot;. This is not so obvious in a case like a coin toss. In a different example, one could consider javelin throw lengths, where the events typically are intervals like &quot;between 60 and 65 meters&quot; and unions of such intervals, but not sets like the &quot;irrational numbers between 60 and 65 meters&quot;.

== Definition ==
In short, a probability space is a measure space such that the measure of the whole space is equal to one.

The expanded definition is the following: a probability space is a triple formula_41 consisting of:
* the sample space formula_2 – an arbitrary non-empty set,
* the σ-algebra formula_43 (also called σ-field) – a set of subsets of formula_2, called events, such that:
** formula_3 contains the sample space: formula_46,
** formula_3 is closed under complements: if formula_48, then also formula_49,
** formula_3 is closed under countable unions: if formula_51 for formula_52, then also formula_53
*** The corollary from the previous two properties and De Morgan&#x27;s law is that formula_3 is also closed under countable intersections: if formula_51 for formula_56, then also formula_57
* the probability measure formula_58 – a function on formula_3 such that:
** &quot;P&quot; is countably additive (also called σ-additive): if formula_60 is a countable collection of pairwise disjoint sets, then formula_61
** the measure of the entire sample space is equal to one: formula_62.

== Discrete case ==

Discrete probability theory needs only at most countable sample spaces formula_2. Probabilities can be ascribed to points of formula_2 by the probability mass function formula_65 such that formula_66. All subsets of formula_2 can be treated as events (thus, formula_68 is the power set). The probability measure takes the simple form

The greatest σ-algebra formula_68 describes the complete information. In general, a σ-algebra formula_70 corresponds to a finite or countable partition formula_71, the general form of an event formula_48 being formula_73. See also the examples.

The case formula_74 is permitted by the definition, but rarely used, since such formula_16 can safely be excluded from the sample space.

== General case ==

If is uncountable, still, it may happen that for some ; such are called atoms. They are an at most countable (maybe empty) set, whose probability is the sum of probabilities of all atoms. If this sum is equal to 1 then all other points can safely be excluded from the sample space, returning us to the discrete case. Otherwise, if the sum of probabilities of all atoms is between 0 and 1, then the probability space decomposes into a discrete (atomic) part (maybe empty) and a non-atomic part.

== Non-atomic case ==

If for all (in this case, Ω must be uncountable, because otherwise could not be satisfied), then equation () fails: the probability of a set is not necessarily the sum over the probabilities of its elements, as summation is only defined for countable numbers of elements. This makes the probability space theory much more technical. A formulation stronger than summation, measure theory is applicable. Initially the probabilities are ascribed to some &quot;generator&quot; sets (see the examples). Then a limiting procedure allows assigning probabilities to sets that are limits of sequences of generator sets, or limits of limits, and so on. All these sets are the σ-algebra formula_76. For technical details see Carathéodory&#x27;s extension theorem. Sets belonging to formula_76 are called measurable. In general they are much more complicated than generator sets, but much better than non-measurable sets.

== Complete probability space ==

A probability space formula_78 is said to be a complete probability space if for all formula_79 with formula_80 and all formula_81 one has formula_82. Often, the study of probability spaces is restricted to complete probability spaces.

== Examples ==

=== Discrete examples ===

==== Example 1 ====
If the experiment consists of just one flip of a fair coin, then the outcome is either heads or tails: formula_83. The σ-algebra formula_84 contains formula_85 events, namely: formula_86 (&quot;heads&quot;), formula_87 (&quot;tails&quot;), formula_88 (&quot;neither heads nor tails&quot;), and formula_89 (&quot;either heads or tails&quot;); in other words, formula_90. There is a fifty percent chance of tossing heads and fifty percent for tails, so the probability measure in this example is formula_91, formula_92, formula_93, formula_94.

==== Example 2 ====
The fair coin is tossed three times. There are 8 possible outcomes: (here &quot;HTH&quot; for example means that first time the coin landed heads, the second time tails, and the last time heads again). The complete information is described by the σ-algebra formula_95 of events, where each of the events is a subset of Ω.

Alice knows the outcome of the second toss only. Thus her incomplete information is described by the partition , where ⊔ is the &quot;disjoint union&quot;, and the corresponding σ-algebra formula_96. Bryan knows only the total number of tails. His partition contains four parts: ; accordingly, his σ-algebra formula_97 contains 24 = 16 events.

The two σ-algebras are incomparable: neither formula_98 nor formula_99; both are sub-σ-algebras of 2Ω.

==== Example 3 ====
If 100 voters are to be drawn randomly from among all voters in California and asked whom they will vote for governor, then the set of all sequences of 100 Californian voters would be the sample space Ω. We assume that sampling without replacement is used: only sequences of 100 &quot;different&quot; voters are allowed. For simplicity an ordered sample is considered, that is a sequence (Alice, Bryan) is different from (Bryan, Alice). We also take for granted that each potential voter knows exactly his/her future choice, that is he/she does not choose randomly.

Alice knows only whether or not Arnold Schwarzenegger has received at least 60 votes. Her incomplete information is described by the σ-algebra formula_100 that contains: (1) the set of all sequences in Ω where at least 60 people vote for Schwarzenegger; (2) the set of all sequences where fewer than 60 vote for Schwarzenegger; (3) the whole sample space Ω; and (4) the empty set ∅.

Bryan knows the exact number of voters who are going to vote for Schwarzenegger. His incomplete information is described by the corresponding partition and the σ-algebra formula_97 consists of 2101 events.

In this case, Alice&#x27;s σ-algebra is a subset of Bryan&#x27;s: formula_102. Bryan&#x27;s σ-algebra is in turn a subset of the much larger &quot;complete information&quot; σ-algebra 2Ω consisting of events, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of all potential voters in California.

=== Non-atomic examples ===

==== Example 4 ====
A number between 0 and 1 is chosen at random, uniformly. Here Ω = [0,1], formula_76 is the σ-algebra of Borel sets on Ω, and &quot;P&quot; is the Lebesgue measure on [0,1].

In this case, the open intervals of the form , where , could be taken as the generator sets. Each such set can be ascribed the probability of , which generates the Lebesgue measure on [0,1], and the Borel σ-algebra on Ω.

==== Example 5 ====
A fair coin is tossed endlessly. Here one can take Ω = {0,1}∞, the set of all infinite sequences of numbers 0 and 1. Cylinder sets may be used as the generator sets. Each such set describes an event in which the first &quot;n&quot; tosses have resulted in a fixed sequence , and the rest of the sequence may be arbitrary. Each such event can be naturally given the probability of 2−&quot;n&quot;.

These two non-atomic examples are closely related: a sequence leads to the number . This is not a one-to-one correspondence between {0,1}∞ and [0,1] however: it is an isomorphism modulo zero, which allows for treating the two probability spaces as two forms of the same probability space. In fact, all non-pathological non-atomic probability spaces are the same in this sense. They are so-called standard probability spaces. Basic applications of probability spaces are insensitive to standardness. However, non-discrete conditioning is easy and natural on standard probability spaces, otherwise it becomes obscure.

== Related concepts ==

=== Probability distribution ===
=== Random variables ===

A random variable &quot;X&quot; is a measurable function &quot;X&quot;: Ω → &quot;S&quot; from the sample space Ω to another measurable space &quot;S&quot; called the &quot;state space&quot;.

If &quot;A&quot; ⊂ &quot;S&quot;, the notation Pr(&quot;X&quot; ∈ &quot;A&quot;) is a commonly used shorthand for formula_104.

=== Defining the events in terms of the sample space ===
If Ω is countable, we almost always define formula_76 as the power set of Ω, i.e. formula_106 which is trivially a σ-algebra and the biggest one we can create using Ω. We can therefore omit formula_76 and just write (Ω,P) to define the probability space.

On the other hand, if Ω is uncountable and we use formula_106 we get into trouble defining our probability measure &quot;P&quot; because formula_76 is too &quot;large&quot;, i.e. there will often be sets to which it will be impossible to assign a unique measure. In this case, we have to use a smaller σ-algebra formula_76, for example the Borel algebra of Ω, which is the smallest σ-algebra that makes all open sets measurable.

=== Conditional probability ===

Kolmogorov&#x27;s definition of probability spaces gives rise to the natural concept of conditional probability. Every set with non-zero probability (that is, ) defines another probability measure

on the space. This is usually pronounced as the &quot;probability of &quot;B&quot; given &quot;A&quot;.

For any event such that , the function defined by for all events is itself a probability measure.

=== Independence ===

Two events, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are said to be independent if .

Two random variables, and , are said to be independent if any event defined in terms of is independent of any event defined in terms of . Formally, they generate independent σ-algebras, where two σ-algebras and , which are subsets of are said to be independent if any element of is independent of any element of .

=== Mutual exclusivity ===

Two events, and are said to be mutually exclusive or &quot;disjoint&quot; if the occurrence of one implies the non-occurrence of the other, i.e., their intersection is empty. This is a stronger condition than the probability of their intersection being zero.

If and are disjoint events, then . This extends to a (finite or countably infinite) sequence of events. However, the probability of the union of an uncountable set of events is not the sum of their probabilities. For example, if is a normally distributed random variable, then is 0 for any , but .

The event is referred to as &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, and the event as &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot;&quot;.

<text>A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a computer network that interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic region of the size of a metropolitan area. The term MAN is applied to the interconnection of local area networks (LANs) in a city into a single larger network which may then also offer efficient connection to a wide area network. The term is also used to describe the interconnection of several LANs in a metropolitan area through the use of point-to-point connections between them.

== History ==
By 1999, local area networks (LANs) were well established and providing data communication in buildings and offices. For the interconnection of LANs within a city, businesses relied primarily on the public switched telephone network. But while the telephone network was able to support the packet-based exchange of data that the various LAN protocols implemented, the bandwidth of the telephone network was already under heavy demand from circuit-switched voice, and the telephone exchanges were ill-designed to cope with the traffic spikes that LANs tended to produce.

To interconnect local area networks more effectively, it was suggested that office buildings are connected using the single-mode optical fiber lines, which were by that time widely used in long-haul telephone trunks. Such dark fibre links were in some cases already installed on customer premises and telephone companies started to offer their dark fibre within their subscriber packages. Fibre optic metropolitan area networks were operated by telephone companies as private networks for their customers and did not necessarily have full integration with the public wide area network (WAN) through gateways.

Besides the larger companies that connected their offices across metropolitan areas, universities and research institutions also adopted dark fibre as their metropolitan area network backbone. In West Berlin the BERCOM project built up a multifunctional broadband communications system to connect the mainframe computers that publicly funded universities and research institutions in the city housed. The BERCOM MAN project could progress at speed because the Deutsche Bundespost had already installed hundreds of miles of fibre optic cable in West Berlin. Like other metropolitan dark fibre networks at the time, the dark fibre network in West Berlin had a star topology with a hub somewhere in the city centre. The backbone of the dedicated BERCOM MAN for universities and research institutions was an optical fibre double ring that used a high-speed slotted ring protocol developed by the GMD Research Centre for Innovative Computer Systems and Telephony. The BERCOM MAN backbone could thus support two times 280 Mbit/s data transfer.
The productive use of dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) provided another impetus for the development of metropolitan area networks in the 2000s. Long haul DWDM, with ranges from 0 to 3000+ km, had been developed so that companies that stored large amounts of data on different sites could exchange data or establish mirrors of their file server. With the use of DWDM on the existing fibre optic MANs of carriers, companies no longer needed to connect their LANs with a dedicated fibre optic link. With DWDM companies could build dedicated MANs using the existing dark fibre network of a provider in a city. MANs thus became cheaper to build and maintain. The DWDM platforms provided by dark fibre providers in cities allow for a single fibre pair to be divided into 32 wavelengths. One wavelength could support between 10 Mbit/s and 10 Gbit/s. Thus companies that paid for a MAN to connect different office sites within a city could increase the bandwidths of their MAN backbone as part of their subscription. DWDM platforms also alleviated the need for protocol conversion to connect LANs in a city, because any protocol and any traffic type could be transmitted using DWDM. Effectively it gave companies wishing to establish a MAN choice of protocol.
Metro Ethernet uses a fibre optic ring as a Gigabit Ethernet MAN backbone within a larger city. The ring topology is implemented using Internet Protocol (IP) so that data can be rerouted if a link is congested or fails. In the US the Sprint was an early adopter of fibre optic rings that routed IP packets on the MAN backbone. Between 2002 and 2003 Sprint built three MAN rings to cover San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose, and in turn connected these three metro rings with a further two rings. The Sprint metro rings routed voice and data, were connected to several local telecom exchange points and totalled 189 miles of fibre optic cable. The metro rings also connected many cities that went on to become part of the Silicon Valley tech-hub, such as Fremont, Milpitas, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Redwood City, San Bruno, San Carlos, Santa Clara and Sunnyvale.

The metro Ethernet rings that did not route IP traffic instead used one of the various proprietary spanning tree protocol implementations; each MAN ring had a &quot;root bridge&quot;. Because layer 2 switching can not operate if there is a loop in the network, the protocols to support L2 MAN rings all need to block redundant links and thus block part of the ring. Capsuling protocols, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), were also deployed to address the drawbacks of operating L2 metro Ethernet rings.

Metro Ethernet was effectively the extension of Ethernet protocols beyond the local area network (LAN) and the ensuing investment in Ethernet led to the deployment of carrier Ethernet, where Ethernet protocols are used in wide area networks (WANs). The efforts of the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) in defining best practice and standards for metropolitan area networks thus also defined carrier Ethernet. While the IEEE tried to standardise the emerging Ethernet-based proprietary protocols, industry forums such as the MEF filled the gap and in January 2013 launched a certification for network equipment that can be configured to meet &quot;Carrier Ethernet 2.0&quot; specifications.

== Metropolitan Internet exchange points ==

Internet exchange points (IXs) have historically been important for the connection of MANs to the national or global Internet. The Boston Metropolitan Exchange Point (Boston MXP) enabled metro Ethernet providers, such as the HarvardNet to exchange data with national carriers, such as the Sprint Corporation and AT&amp;T. Exchange points also serve as low-latency links between campus area networks, thus the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Boston University could exchange data, voice and video using the Boston MXP. Further examples of metropolitan Internet exchanges in the USA that were operational include the Anchorage Metropolitan Access Point (AMAP), the Seattle Internet Exchange (SIX), the Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan Access Point (DFMAP) and the Denver Internet Exchange (IX-Denver). Verizon put into operation three regional metropolitan exchanges to interconnect MANs and give them access to the Internet. The MAE-West serves the MANs of San Jose, Los Angeles and California. The MAE-East interconnects the MANs of New York City, Washington, D.C., and Miami. While the MAE-Central interconnects the MANs of Dallas, Texas, and Illinois.

In larger cities several local providers may have built a dark fibre MAN backbone. In London, the metro Ethernet rings of several providers make up the London MAN infrastructure. Like other MANs, the London MAN primarily serves the needs of its urban customers, who typically need a high number of connections with low bandwidth, a fast transit to other MAN providers, as well as high bandwidth access to national and international long-haul providers. Within the MAN of larger cities, metropolitan exchange points now play a vital role. The London Internet Exchange (LINX) had by 2005 built up several exchange points across the Greater London region.

Cities that host one of the international Internet exchanges have become a preferred location for companies and data centres. The Amsterdam Internet Exchange (AMS-IX) is the world&#x27;s second-largest Internet exchange and has attracted companies to Amsterdam that are dependent on high-speed internet access. The Amsterdam metropolitan area network has benefited too from high-speed Internet access. Similarly Frankfurt has become a magnet for data centres of international companies because it hosts the non-profit DE-CIX, the largest Internet exchange in the world. The business model of the metro DE-CIX is to reduce the transit cost for local carriers by keeping data in the metropolitan area or region, while at the same time allowing long-haul low-latency peering globally with other major MANs.

<text>In mathematics, a Borel set is any set in a topological space that can be formed from open sets (or, equivalently, from closed sets) through the operations of countable union, countable intersection, and relative complement. Borel sets are named after Émile Borel.

For a topological space &quot;X&quot;, the collection of all Borel sets on &quot;X&quot; forms a σ-algebra, known as the Borel algebra or Borel σ-algebra. The Borel algebra on &quot;X&quot; is the smallest σ-algebra containing all open sets (or, equivalently, all closed sets).

Borel sets are important in measure theory, since any measure defined on the open sets of a space, or on the closed sets of a space, must also be defined on all Borel sets of that space. Any measure defined on the Borel sets is called a Borel measure. Borel sets and the associated Borel hierarchy also play a fundamental role in descriptive set theory.

In some contexts, Borel sets are defined to be generated by the compact sets of the topological space, rather than the open sets. The two definitions are equivalent for many well-behaved spaces, including all Hausdorff σ-compact spaces, but can be different in more pathological spaces.

== Generating the Borel algebra ==

In the case that &quot;X&quot; is a metric space, the Borel algebra in the first sense may be described &quot;generatively&quot; as follows.

For a collection &quot;T&quot; of subsets of &quot;X&quot; (that is, for any subset of the power set P(&quot;X&quot;) of &quot;X&quot;), let
* formula_1 be all countable unions of elements of &quot;T&quot;
* formula_2 be all countable intersections of elements of &quot;T&quot;
* formula_3

Now define by transfinite induction a sequence &quot;Gm&quot;, where &quot;m&quot; is an ordinal number, in the following manner:
* For the base case of the definition, let formula_4 be the collection of open subsets of &quot;X&quot;.
* If &quot;i&quot; is not a limit ordinal, then &quot;i&quot; has an immediately preceding ordinal &quot;i&quot; − 1. Let formula_5
* If &quot;i&quot; is a limit ordinal, set formula_6

The claim is that the Borel algebra is &quot;G&quot;ω1, where ω1 is the first uncountable ordinal number. That is, the Borel algebra can be &quot;generated&quot; from the class of open sets by iterating the operation
formula_7
to the first uncountable ordinal.

To prove this claim, any open set in a metric space is the union of an increasing sequence of closed sets. In particular, complementation of sets maps &quot;Gm&quot; into itself for any limit ordinal &quot;m&quot;; moreover if &quot;m&quot; is an uncountable limit ordinal, &quot;Gm&quot; is closed under countable unions.

For each Borel set &quot;B&quot;, there is some countable ordinal &quot;αB&quot; such that &quot;B&quot; can be obtained by iterating the operation over &quot;αB&quot;. However, as &quot;B&quot; varies over all Borel sets, &quot;αB&quot; will vary over all the countable ordinals, and thus the first ordinal at which all the Borel sets are obtained is &quot;ω&quot;1, the first uncountable ordinal.

The resulting sequence of sets is termed the Borel hierarchy.

=== Example ===
An important example, especially in the theory of probability, is the Borel algebra on the set of real numbers. It is the algebra on which the Borel measure is defined. Given a real random variable defined on a probability space, its probability distribution is by definition also a measure on the Borel algebra.

The Borel algebra on the reals is the smallest σ-algebra on R that contains all the intervals.

In the construction by transfinite induction, it can be shown that, in each step, the number of sets is, at most, the cardinality of the continuum. So, the total number of Borel sets is less than or equal to
formula_8

In fact, the cardinality of the collection of Borel sets is equal to that of the continuum (compare to the number of Lebesgue measurable sets that exist, which is strictly larger and equal to formula_9).

== Standard Borel spaces and Kuratowski theorems ==

Let &quot;X&quot; be a topological space. The Borel space associated to &quot;X&quot; is the pair (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;B&quot;), where &quot;B&quot; is the σ-algebra of Borel sets of &quot;X&quot;.

George Mackey defined a Borel space somewhat differently, writing that it is &quot;a set together with a distinguished σ-field of subsets called its Borel sets.&quot; However, modern usage is to call the distinguished sub-algebra the &quot;measurable sets&quot; and such spaces &quot;measurable spaces&quot;. The reason for this distinction is that the Borel sets are the σ-algebra generated by &quot;open&quot; sets (of a topological space), whereas Mackey&#x27;s definition refers to a set equipped with an &quot;arbitrary&quot; σ-algebra. There exist measurable spaces that are not Borel spaces, for any choice of topology on the underlying space.

Measurable spaces form a category in which the morphisms are measurable functions between measurable spaces. A function formula_10 is measurable if it pulls back measurable sets, i.e., for all measurable sets &quot;B&quot; in &quot;Y&quot;, the set formula_11 is measurable in &quot;X&quot;.

Theorem. Let &quot;X&quot; be a Polish space, that is, a topological space such that there is a metric &quot;d&quot; on &quot;X&quot; that defines the topology of &quot;X&quot; and that makes &quot;X&quot; a complete separable metric space. Then &quot;X&quot; as a Borel space is isomorphic to one of
# R, 
# Z, 
# a finite space. 
(This result is reminiscent of Maharam&#x27;s theorem.)

Considered as Borel spaces, the real line R, the union of R with a countable set, and Rn are isomorphic.

A standard Borel space is the Borel space associated to a Polish space. A standard Borel space is characterized up to isomorphism by its cardinality, and any uncountable standard Borel space has the cardinality of the continuum.

For subsets of Polish spaces, Borel sets can be characterized as those sets that are the ranges of continuous injective maps defined on Polish spaces. Note however, that the range of a continuous noninjective map may fail to be Borel. See analytic set.

Every probability measure on a standard Borel space turns it into a standard probability space.

== Non-Borel sets ==

An example of a subset of the reals that is non-Borel, due to Lusin, is described below. In contrast, an example of a non-measurable set cannot be exhibited, although the existence of such a set is implied, for example, by the axiom of choice.

Every irrational number has a unique representation by an infinite simple continued fraction

:formula_12

where formula_13 is some integer and all the other numbers formula_14 are &quot;positive&quot; integers. Let formula_15 be the set of all irrational numbers that correspond to sequences formula_16 with the following property: there exists an infinite subsequence formula_17 such that each element is a divisor of the next element. This set formula_15 is not Borel. However, it is analytic (all Borel sets are also analytic), and complete in the class of analytic sets. For more details see descriptive set theory and the book by A. S. Kechris (see References), especially Exercise (27.2) on page 209, Definition (22.9) on page 169, Exercise (3.4)(ii) on page 14, and on page 196.

It&#x27;s important to note, that while Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms (ZF) are sufficient to formalize the construction of formula_15, it cannot be proven in ZF alone that formula_15 is non-Borel. In fact, it is consistent with ZF that formula_21 is a countable union of countable sets, so that any subset of formula_21 is a Borel set.

Another non-Borel set is an inverse image formula_23 of an infinite parity function formula_24. However, this is a proof of existence (via the axiom of choice), not an explicit example.

==Alternative non-equivalent definitions==

According to Paul Halmos, a subset of a locally compact Hausdorff topological space is called a &quot;Borel set&quot; if it belongs to the smallest σ-ring containing all compact sets.

Norberg and Vervaat redefine the Borel algebra of a topological space formula_25 as the formula_26-algebra generated by its open subsets and its compact saturated subsets. This definition is well-suited for applications in the case where formula_25 is not Hausdorff. It coincides with the usual definition if formula_25 is second countable or if every compact saturated subset is closed (which is the case in particular if formula_25 is Hausdorff).

<doc id="43330" wikidata="Q845236" url="?curid=43330" title="Professional Association of Diving Instructors">
<text>The Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) is a recreational diving membership and diver training organization founded in 1966 by John Cronin and Ralph Erickson. PADI courses range from entry level to advanced recreational diver certification. Further, they provide several diving skills courses connected with specific equipment or conditions, some diving related informational courses and a range of recreational diving instructor certifications. They also offer various technical diving courses. As of 2020, PADI claims to have issued 28 million scuba certifications. The levels are not specified and may include minor specialisations. Some of the certifications align with WRSTC and ISO standards, and these are recognised worldwide. Some other certification is unique to PADI and has no equivalence anywhere, or may be part of other agencies&#x27; standards for certification for more general diving skill levels.

== History ==

In 1966, PADI was founded by John Cronin and Ralph Erickson. Cronin was originally a NAUI instructor who decided to form his own organization with Erickson, and to break diver training down into several modular courses instead of the single universal course then prevalent. Erickson developed continuing education scuba courses during this time and wrote the initial issue of the first trade magazine for scuba instructors, &quot;The Undersea Journal&quot;. Cronin got the idea for PADI&#x27;s Positive Identification Card at a trade show. PADI established the Master Scuba Diver certification, the industry&#x27;s first certification awarded for accumulation of specified certification and experience, and not based on a specific training program, in 1973, later launching the modular scuba program. By 1979, PADI was producing 100,000 certifications a year after previously hitting 25,000 a year. PADI was the first organization to use confined water or pool dives for training new divers and introduced the PADI Rescue Diver course and manual for rescue training during the 1980s.

In 1989, PADI founded Project AWARE to help conserve underwater environments. In 1992, Project AWARE Foundation became a registered nonprofit organization with an environmental mission and purpose. PADI continues to partner with PADI AWARE, supporting the organization with in-kind services, donations through its processes and connection to the PADI network of divers, dive professionals and dive centers. PADI AWARE information has been integrated in most courses and divers are offered the chance to exchange their normal certification card for an AWARE-certification card by making a donation to the program when sending in their application for a new certification.

In 2006, PADI was severely criticized by a Coroner&#x27;s court in the United Kingdom for providing what experts regarded as short and insufficient training. Although PADI training standards differ from those formerly prevalent in the United Kingdom under the BSAC system, PADI training standards are consistent with World Recreational Scuba Training Council standards.

On 9 August 2012, Lincolnshire Management and Providence Equity Partners jointly acquired PADI from Seidler Equity Partners. In 2015, Providence Equity Partners acquired majority stake of PADI from Lincolnshire Management.

In 2017, Providence Equity Partners LLC sold PADI to Canadian investment firm &quot;Altas Partners&quot; and French private equity firm &quot;Florac&quot; for 700 million USD, through an entity called Mandarin fish Holding.

In 2018, PADI launched PADI Travel, an online dive travel resource and booking platform for dive resort and live-aboard packages.

In 2021, PADI reported it had a membership of over 128,000 professional members and 6,600 dive centers, and had awarded more than 28 million diving certifications internationally. PADI operates in 186 countries and
territories. From 2015-2020, the average male to female membership split was approximately 63% to 37% respectively. The organization hosts Women&#x27;s Dive Day events across the globe in an effort to increase awareness for women divers.

==Training system==

PADI courses are performance-based diver training programs,
and at the introductory level emphasizes practical knowledge, safety and motor skills. The basics of diving physics and physiology are introduced during entry level programs. The details of these concepts are left for later courses when they are necessary for the required competences of the specific training. According to PADI, these practices fall within current modern learning philosophies and receive regular updates via peer review.

The PADI training system is composed of modules with standardized learning objectives divided into theory and practical skills development. Each module is a stand-alone course for which certification is provided to the participant on successful completion of the course. Theory is mainly conveyed by way of self-study using books or digital training using PADI E-Learning. All study options are supplemented with video and, in most cases, live instruction to help the participant visualize what they have read. Confirmation of the student diver&#x27;s level of competence in standardized knowledge review sessions is carried out by a scuba instructor using both written tests and personal observation during dives to verify the student&#x27;s knowledge and skills. Practical skills are obtained through confined water training (pools or relatively shallow water) and performance evaluations in open water.

PADI courses target four progressive experience demographics, designated by PADI as &quot;Youth&quot;, &quot;Beginner&quot;, &quot;Continuing Education&quot; and &quot;Professional&quot;. Options are available for students or instructors to attain additional certifications across a range of categories, including &quot;Essentials&quot;, &quot;Safety Focus&quot;, &quot;Advanced Skills&quot;, &quot;Cold Water&quot;, &quot;Conservation&quot;, &quot;Photography&quot;, &quot;Discovery&quot;, &quot;Freediving&quot; and &quot;Technical Diving&quot;.

For the youth demographic, the Padi Seal Team and Bubblemaker Programs are provided for students ages 8+.

As of 2023, the courses in &quot;Beginner&quot;, &quot;Continuing Education&quot; and &quot;Professional&quot; categories include:
===Training standards===

PADI training standards are generally inaccessible to the public via internet search, making an informed decision on whether a specific training course is appropriate to the diver&#x27;s needs difficult. Those few programs which comply with ISO standards can be assumed to at least nominally include all the requirements of the ISO standard, but not necessarily anything more. 
Some PADI courses, i.e. those which have no actual diving component, may be presented and assessed by a PADI Divemaster registered with PADI to run the specific course. Some additional training and course attendance is required. These courses do not include actual diving skills, just skills or knowledge that may be useful while diving or interesting in the context of diving.

Some PADI training standards have been found to be ambiguous of contradictory, For example, the PADI Advanced Open Water Diver course does not require direct instructor supervision of a student during &quot;adventure dives&quot;, which may include a diver&#x27;s first experience using a dry suit, while the standard for the PADI Dry Suit Diver course requires not only direct supervision of the student by the instructor, during open water dives, but also that open water dives must be preceded by a theory class, and a confined water skills training session, both of which must be satisfactorily completed before venturing into open water.

A PADI Open Water Instructor can be registered as a specialty instructor for several specialties, without demonstrating competence to teach or even perform those specialties, including Dry Suit Diver, which requires a significant skill set and understanding of the principles to be done safely.

===Workplace programs===
PADI offers a specialty program called Public Safety Diver for divers who are either employed in or serve as volunteers in the public safety diving sector principally within the United States. This certification is not recognised in some countries which have national standards for occupational diving qualifications and require registration with a national body.

===First aid programs===
PADI, via its subsidiary, &quot;Emergency First Response, Corp&quot;, distributes the following programs in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and first aid for both divers and non-divers: These may not be recognised by health and safety authorities in some jurisdictions where workplace first aid certification must be through a nationally or state accredited training provider.
* Primary Care (CPR)
* Secondary Care (First Aid)
* Care for Children
* Region-specific workplaces courses for countries including Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.

==Accreditation and memberships==
PADI courses are recognized, recommended and cited by the institutions and organizations listed below for both recreational diving and vocational training.

PADI courses are recommended for college credit in the US by ACE. PADI is a member of the United States Recreational Scuba Training Council (RSTC).

Recognition&#x27;s and equivalencies has been established between PADI and Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques, the Colombian Navy, and Fédération Française d&#x27;Études et de Sports Sous-Marins (FFESSM). PADI is also a registered training organisation in Australia. As of 2012, PADI rescue diver and divemaster programs are included on the United Kingdom&#x27;s Health and Safety Executive list of approved diving qualifications.

Those PADI courses aligning with standards published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for &#x27;Recreational diving services&#x27; were audited by the European Underwater Federation (EUF) Certification Body in 2004 and 2009, and were certified at both times as complying with these standards.

The relevant certifications may include: 
* EN 14153-1 / ISO 24801-1 - Part 1: Level 1 &quot;Supervised Diver&quot; (PADI equivalent – Scuba Diver)
* EN 14153-2 / ISO 24801-2 - Part 2: Level 2 &quot;Autonomous Diver&quot; (PADI equivalent – Open Water Diver)
* EN 14153-3 / ISO 24801-3 - Part 3: Level 3 &quot;Dive Leader&quot; (PADI equivalent – Divemaster)
* EN 14413-1 / ISO 24802-1 - Part 1: Level 1 Instructor (PADI equivalent – Assistant Instructor)
* EN 14413-2 / ISO 24802-2 - Part 2: Level 2 Instructor (PADI equivalent – Open Water Scuba Instructor)
* ISO 11107 Enriched air nitrox (EAN) diving (PADI equivalent – Enriched Air Diver)
* ISO 11121 introductory training programs to scuba diving. (PADI equivalent – Discover Scuba Diving)
Most PADI training programs are not directly covered by ISO standards.

PADI is a member of the following member councils of the World Recreational Scuba Training Council – the RSTC Canada, the RSTC Europe and the C-Card Council (Japan).

==Business strategy==
PADI is recognised as the largest recreational diver training agency with the largest rate of issue of diver certification, and the largest membership of professional instructors and dive leaders in recreational diving. They are a for-profit organization focused on efficiency of training of the largest number of customers.

To gain membership of PADI, a person must agree to follow PADI training standards, be reviewed by PADI for quality assurance, sign the membership agreement and pay the annual membership dues, for which they are allowed to buy PADI course materials, resell them to their customers, and use the PADI trademarks and logos for marketing their services.

In early 2024 PADI dive centers in Africa and the Middle East were prohibited from offering scuba diving training with certification from any agency other than PADI.
===Marketing===
PADI marketing puts an emphasis on convenience, fun and continued attendance on PADI courses. Risk management is largely by limitations on the certified diver&#x27;s recommended range of acceptable environmental and equipment options and providing profitable additional training programs to extend these options by small increments.

PADI offers dive shops and training centers the opportunity to affiliate with the PADI brand by becoming a member of the PADI Retailer and Resort Association (PADI RRA) which is a worldwide group of dive shops and resorts committed to selling PADI products and promoting the PADI diving and marketing philosophy. PADI Worldwide, Inc. contracts directly with member dive shops to join the RRA, and PADI Americas, Inc. administers the RRA in the United States.

A PADI 5 Star Dive Center is a dive center that exclusively offers PADI training and certification, has been a PADI dive center for at least 12 months, with no verified violations of PADI quality assurance over that period and no open QA investigations, and have been awarded all three of PADI&#x27;s dive center recognition awards (the criteria for which do not appear to be publicly available). The center must also advertise to recruit and retain customers. The center must have provided at least one course each of Advanced Open Water Diver, PADI Rescue Diver, and Divemaster or Assistant Instructor, in the previous year, and provide diving activities or travel apart from training. There is no mention or guarantee of better quality service compared to any other dive center.

A PADI Elite Instructor is a PADI instructor with no verified QA violations who certifies more than a specified number of divers per year.
===Quality assurance===

According to a statement by an attorney for PADI, PADI issues disclaimers on various documents, saying member shops are not agents of PADI, and PADI is no more than a professional organisation and certifying agency, and its members operate independently, and PADI is therefore not responsible for their actions or omissions.

In a civil case in Missoula, Montana, where PADI Open Water Diver Linnea Mills drowned during a PADI course where the PADI dive shop and PADI instructor allegedly contravened both PADI training standards, PADI business practices, and several other procedures generally considered safe recreational diving practice, PADI&#x27;s argument that Gull Dive and their staff were neither its agents nor employees, and that it could not be held responsible for the death of a client of Gull Dive was overruled by a judge, who stated that PADI exerted control over Gull Dive and its instructors by way of its membership agreement, which obliged members to follow its standards and instructions.

==Specialty training==
===Adaptive Support Diver===
Adaptive Support Diver is a course for divers who want to support a dive buddy with a physical or mental barrier to full independence as a recreational diver, and must rely on some support from one or more support divers for acceptable safety. The training is targeted on increasing the support diver&#x27;s awareness of the challenged diver&#x27;s abilities and limitations, and how to effectively assist in their management. Prerequisites are Open Water Diver, in date Emergency First Response primary and secondary care, and recommended PADI Peak Performance Buoyancy. The course covers diving with people with reduced mobility and supporting divers who are blind or have less obvious disabilities, and focuses on what disabled people can do, to help the support diver understand the use of adaptive techniques.

==Affiliates and sponsorships==
Since 2009, PADI and the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) have maintained a mutual support partnership. In Canada, PADI sponsors the Scouts Canada Scuba Program. Affiliates include:

* Emergency First Response provides CPR and First Aid training both for the lay person and in the workplace.
* Current Publishing Corporation develops marine science programs for high school and upper level educational facilities.
* Diving Science and Technology Corporation (DSAT) is the development arm for the Recreational Dive Planner and PADI&#x27;s Tec-Rec program.

===Citations in professional literature===

PADI&#x27;s instructional methodology is cited in EDUCAUSE&#x27;s 2012 book, &quot;Game Changers: Education and Information Technologies&quot; regarding badges as &quot;a symbol or indicator of an accomplishment, skill, quality, or interest. From the Boy and Girl Scouts to PADI diving instruction, to the more recently popular geolocation game Foursquare, badges have been successfully used to set goals, motivate behaviors, represent achievements, and communicate success in many contexts.&quot;

PADI&#x27;s environmental emphasis is cited in the 2007 book, &quot;New Frontiers in Marine Tourism&quot;, in its section, Dive Tourism, Sustainable Tourism and Social Responsibility: A Growing Agenda – Environmental management and education: the case of PADI, (Chapter Seven). &quot;PADI, as well as other diver certification organisations and individual businesses, has put significant resources into conservation and developed public awareness programs&quot;.

&quot;New Frontiers in Marine Tourism&quot; also cites in the section entitled Student Scholarships and Social Responsibility: A Growing Agenda for PADI, that &quot;The PADI Scholarship program … is a good example of the way that various disparate parts of an industry, each with limited resources, can pool their efforts to help more people from developing countries to enter the diving profession… PADI recognizes that good relations with the involvement of local people is essential both to business development and to environmental protection. The scholarship scheme makes entry into the dive business more possible for some students who have the backing of their dive center.&quot;

<doc id="43331" wikidata="Q94002" url="?curid=43331" title="Barbara Stanwyck">
<text>Barbara Stanwyck (; born Ruby Catherine Stevens; July 16, 1907 – January 20, 1990) was an American actress and dancer. A stage, film, and television star, during her 60-year professional career, she was known for her strong, realistic screen presence and versatility. She was a favorite of directors, including Cecil B. DeMille, Fritz Lang, and Frank Capra, and made 85 films in 38 years before turning to television.

Orphaned at the age of four and partially raised in foster homes, she always worked. One of her directors, Jacques Tourneur, said of her, &quot;She only lives for two things, and both of them are work.&quot; She made her debut on stage in the chorus as a Ziegfeld girl in 1923 at age 16, and within a few years was acting in plays. Her first lead role, which was in the hit &quot;Burlesque&quot; (1927), established her as a Broadway star.

In 1929, she began acting in talking pictures. Frank Capra chose her for his romantic drama &quot;Ladies of Leisure&quot; (1930). This led to additional leading roles which raised her profile, such as &quot;Night Nurse&quot; (1931), &quot;Baby Face&quot; (1933), and the controversial &quot;The Bitter Tea of General Yen&quot; (1933). In 1937, she played the title role in &quot;Stella Dallas&quot;, for which she earned her first Academy Award nomination for best actress. In 1939, she starred in &quot;Union Pacific&quot;. In 1941, she starred in two screwball comedies: &quot;Ball of Fire&quot; with Gary Cooper, and &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; with Henry Fonda. She received her second Academy Award nomination for &quot;Ball of Fire&quot;, and in the decades since its release &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; has come to be regarded as a comedic classic, with Stanwyck&#x27;s performance called one of the best in American comedy. Other successful films during this period are &quot;Meet John Doe&quot; (1940) and &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; (1941), reteaming her with Cooper and Fonda, respectively. By 1944, Stanwyck had become the highest-paid actress in the United States. She starred with Fred MacMurray in the seminal film noir &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1944), playing the wife who persuades an insurance salesman to kill her husband, for which she received her third Oscar nomination. In 1945, she starred as a homemaker columnist in the hit romantic comedy &quot;Christmas in Connecticut&quot;. The next year, she portrayed the title tragic femme fatale in &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot;. She garnered her fourth Oscar nomination for her performance as an invalid wife in the noir-thriller &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot; (1948). Stanwyck&#x27;s film career declined by the start of the 1950s, despite having a fair number of leading and major supporting roles in the decade, the most successful being &quot;Executive Suite&quot; (1954).

She transitioned to television by the 1960s, where she won three Emmy Awards, for &quot;The Barbara Stanwyck Show&quot; (1961), the Western series &quot;The Big Valley&quot; (1966), and the miniseries &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; (1983).

She received an Honorary Oscar in 1982, the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1986, and several other honorary lifetime awards. She was ranked as the 11th greatest female star of classic American cinema by the American Film Institute.

==Early life==
Stanwyck was born Ruby Catherine Stevens on July 16, 1907, in Brooklyn, New York. She was the fifth and youngest child in the working-class family of Kathryn Ann &quot;Kitty&quot; (née McPhee) and Byron E. Stevens. Both parents&#x27; families had been in North America since the 1740s. Her father, of English descent, was a native of Lanesville, Massachusetts, and her mother, of Scotch-Irish descent, was a Canadian immigrant from Sydney, Nova Scotia. She had three older sisters, Laura Mildred (called Millie, b. 1886), Viola Maud (b. 1889) and Mabel (b. 1890), and one older brother, Malcolm Byron (b. 1905). Prior to Stanwyck&#x27;s birth, the family had lived in Massachusetts and New Hampshire but relocated to Brooklyn in 1906 in search for work. 

In July 1911, four-year-old Stanwyck and her six-year-old brother were riding a streetcar with their heavily pregnant mother when a drunk passenger fell and knocked their mother off the vehicle. The accident induced early labor, which resulted in fatal sepsis. The mother&#x27;s death worsened Byron Stevens&#x27; alcoholism and he left the family some weeks later. In early 1912, he joined a work crew digging the Panama Canal. He died in a disease epidemic in the country some years later without ever having contacted his children again.

Stanwyck&#x27;s sisters were already adults, and while they stayed closely involved in their younger siblings&#x27; lives, they could not take care of them full-time. Instead, in the years following the disintegration of their family, Stanwyck and her brother lived in a series of unofficial foster homes in Brooklyn. As the foster homes could only accommodate one child at a time, the siblings were separated, which caused them additional distress. In around 1919, Stanwyck and her brother moved in with their older sister Viola Maud and her family.

Stanwyck attended Public School 152 in Brooklyn. She hated school with the exception of literature and received generally poor grades. She was bullied and routinely picked fights with the other students. 

Stanwyck started to dream about entering show business in childhood. Her sister Millie had become a successful vaudeville dancer and took Stanwyck with her on summer tours. She also idolized film star Pearl White, whose serial &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot; (1914) was popular at the time. As a teenager, Stanwyck began performing in local amateur theater and in shows at the neighborhood&#x27;s film theaters. 

After graduating from P.S. 152, Stanwyck decided to not go to high school. Starting at aged 14, she took a series of customer service and secretarial positions, which allowed her to gain financial independence while pursuing her goal of becoming a celebrated dancer.

==Career==
===Ziegfeld girl and Broadway success===

In 1923, a few months before her 16th birthday, Stanwyck auditioned for a place in the chorus at the Strand Roof, a nightclub over the Strand Theatre in Times Square. A few months later, she obtained a job as a dancer in the 1922 and 1923 seasons of the Ziegfeld Follies, dancing at the New Amsterdam Theater. For the next several years, she worked as a chorus girl, performing from midnight to seven in the morning at nightclubs owned by Texas Guinan. She also occasionally served as a dance instructor at a speakeasy for gays and lesbians owned by Guinan. One of her good friends during those years was pianist Oscar Levant, who described her as being &quot;wary of sophisticates and phonies&quot;.

Billy LaHiff, who owned a popular pub frequented by show people, introduced Stanwyck in 1926 to impresario Willard Mack, who was casting his play &quot;The Noose&quot;. Stanwyck successfully auditioned for the part of the chorus girl. As initially staged, the play was not a success. In an effort to improve it, Mack decided to expand Stanwyck&#x27;s part to include more pathos. &quot;The Noose&quot; re-opened in October 1926, and became one of the most successful plays of the season, running on Broadway for nine months and 197 performances. At the suggestion of David Belasco, Stanwyck changed her name to Barbara Stanwyck by combining the first name of the title character in the play &quot;Barbara Frietchie&quot; with the last name of the actress in the play, Jane Stanwyck; both were found on a 1906 theater program.

Stanwyck had her first leading role in &quot;Burlesque&quot; (1927), which was a critical and commercial success. Its producer Arthur Hopkins later described casting her because she had &quot;a sort of rough poignancy. She at once displayed more sensitive, easily expressed emotion than I had encountered since Pauline Lord.&quot; The same year, Stanwyck made her first film appearance as a fan dancer in &quot;Broadway Nights&quot; (1927). While playing in &quot;Burlesque&quot;, Stanwyck had begun a relationship with actor Frank Fay. Soon after marrying on August 26, 1928, the couple moved to Los Angeles, where Stanwyck hoped to pursue a career in films.

===Film career===

Stanwyck&#x27;s first sound film was &quot;The Locked Door&quot; (1929), followed by &quot;Mexicali Rose&quot;, released in the same year. Neither film was successful; nonetheless, Frank Capra chose Stanwyck for his film &quot;Ladies of Leisure&quot; (1930). Her work in that production established an enduring friendship with the director and led to future roles in his films. Other prominent roles followed, among them as a nurse who saves two little girls from the villainous chauffeur (Clark Gable) in &quot;Night Nurse&quot; (1931). In Edna Ferber&#x27;s novel brought to screen by William Wellman, she portrays small town teacher and valiant Midwest farm woman Selena in &quot;So Big!&quot; (1932). She followed with a performance as an ambitious woman &quot;sleeping&quot; her way to the top from &quot;the wrong side of the tracks&quot; in &quot;Baby Face&quot; (1933), a controversial pre-Code classic. In &quot;The Bitter Tea of General Yen&quot; (1933), another controversial pre-Code film by director Capra, Stanwyck portrays an idealistic Christian caught behind the lines of Chinese civil war kidnapped by warlord Nils Asther. A flop at the time, though it received some critical success, the lavish film is &quot;dark stuff, and it&#x27;s difficult to imagine another actress handling this ... philosophical conversion as fearlessly as Ms. Stanwyck does. She doesn&#x27;t make heavy weather of it.&quot;

Regarding her pre-Code work, Mick LaSalle, movie critic for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said &quot;If you&#x27;ve never seen Stanwyck in a pre-Code film, you&#x27;ve never seen Stanwyck&quot;. (The Code began to be enforced seriously beginning in July 1934.) Never in her career, including &quot;Double Indemnity,&quot; was she ever as hard-boiled as she was in the early 1930s. She had a wonderful quality of being both incredibly cool and yet blazingly passionate. Her cynicism was profound, and then, without warning, she would explode into shrieking, sobbing.&quot;

In &quot;Stella Dallas&quot; (1937) she plays the self-sacrificing title character who eventually allows her teenage daughter to live a better life somewhere else. She landed her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress when she was able to portray her character as vulgar, yet sympathetic as required by the movie. Next, she played Molly Monahan in &quot;Union Pacific&quot; (1939) with Joel McCrea. Stanwyck was reportedly one of the many actresses considered for the role of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), although she did not receive a screen test. In &quot;Meet John Doe&quot; she plays an ambitious newspaperwoman with Gary Cooper (1941).

In Preston Sturges&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; (1941), she plays a slinky, sophisticated con-woman who &quot;gives off an erotic charge that would straighten a boa constrictor&quot;, while falling in love with her intended mark, the guileless, wealthy herpetologist, played by Henry Fonda. Film critic David Thomson described Stanwyck as &quot;giving one of the best American comedy performances&quot;, and she was reviewed as brilliantly versatile in &quot;her bravura double performance&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; is among the top 100 movies of all time on &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&#x27;s&quot; lists, and is considered to be both a great comedy and a great romantic film with its placement at #55 on the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs list and #26 on its 100 Years...100 Passions list.

Next, she was the extremely successful, independent doctor Helen Hunt in &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; (1941), also with Fonda. Stanwyck then played nightclub performer Sugarpuss O&#x27;Shea in the Howard Hawks directed, but Billy Wilder written comedy &quot;Ball of Fire&quot; (1941). In this update of the Snow White and Seven Dwarfs tale, she gives professor Bertram Potts (played by Gary Cooper) a better understanding of &quot;modern English&quot; in the performance for which she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.
&quot;That is the kind of woman that makes whole civilizations topple.&quot; -- Kathleen Howard of Stanwyck&#x27;s character in &quot;Ball of Fire&quot;.

In &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1944), the seminal film noir thriller directed by Billy Wilder, she plays the sizzling blonde tramp/&quot;destiny in high heels&quot; who lures an infatuated insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray), into killing her husband. Stanwyck brings out the cruel nature of the &quot;grim, unflinching murderess&quot;, marking her as the &quot;most notorious femme fatale&quot; in the film noir genre. Her performance as the &quot;insolent, self-possessed wife is one of the screen&#x27;s definitive studies of villainy. &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; is usually considered to be among the top 100 films of all time, though it did not win any of its seven Academy Award nominations. It is the #38 film of all time on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list, as well as the #24 on its 100 Years...100 Thrills list and #84 on its 100 Years...100 Passions list.

She plays a columnist touted as the &quot;greatest cook in the country&quot; caught up in white lies while trying to pursue a romance in the comedy &quot;Christmas in Connecticut&quot; (1945). It was a hit upon release and remains a treasured holiday classic today. In 1946 she was &quot;liquid nitrogen&quot; as Martha, a manipulative murderess, starring with Van Heflin and newcomer Kirk Douglas in &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot;. Stanwyck was also the vulnerable, invalid wife that overhears her own murder being plotted in &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot; (1948) and the doomed concert pianist in &quot;The Other Love&quot; (1947). In the latter film&#x27;s soundtrack, the piano music is actually being performed by Ania Dorfmann, who drilled Stanwyck for three hours a day until the actress was able to synchronize the motion of her arms and hands to match the music&#x27;s tempo, giving a convincing impression that it is Stanwyck playing the piano.

Pauline Kael, a longtime film critic for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, admired the natural appearance of Stanwyck&#x27;s acting style on screen, noting that she &quot;seems to have an intuitive understanding of the fluid physical movements that work best on camera&quot;. In reference to the actress&#x27;s film work during the early sound era, Kael observed that the &quot;[e]arly talkies sentimentality ... only emphasizes Stanwyck&#x27;s remarkable modernism.&quot;

Stanwyck was known for her accessibility and kindness to the backstage crew on any film set. She knew the names of many of their wives and children. Frank Capra said of Stanwyck: &quot;She was destined to be beloved by all directors, actors, crews and extras. In a Hollywood popularity contest, she would win first prize, hands down.&quot; While working on 1954&#x27;s &quot;Cattle Queen of Montana&quot; (also starring Ronald Reagan) on location in Glacier National Park, she performed some of her own stunts, including a swim in the icy lake. At the age of 50, she performed an extremely difficult stunt in &quot;Forty Guns&quot;. The scene called for her character to fall from and be dragged by a horse, and the stunt was so dangerous that the film&#x27;s professional stuntman refused to perform it. She was later named an honorary member of the Hollywood Stuntmen&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

William Holden and Stanwyck were longtime friends and when they were presenting the Best Sound Oscar for 1977, he paused to pay a special tribute to her for saving his career when Holden was cast in the lead for &quot;Golden Boy&quot; (1939). After a series of unsteady daily performances, he was about to be fired, but Stanwyck staunchly defended him, successfully standing up to the film producers. Shortly after Holden&#x27;s death, Stanwyck recalled the moment when receiving her honorary Oscar: &quot;A few years ago, I stood on this stage with William Holden as a presenter. I loved him very much, and I miss him. He always wished that I would get an Oscar. And so, tonight, my golden boy, you got your wish.&quot;

===Television career===
As Stanwyck&#x27;s film career declined during the 1950s, she moved to television. In 1958, she guest-starred in &quot;Trail to Nowhere&quot;, an episode of the Western anthology series &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre&quot;, playing a wife who kills a man to avenge her husband. In 1961, she hosted an anthology drama series titled &quot;The Barbara Stanwyck Show&quot; that was not a ratings success but earned her an Emmy Award. The show ran for a total of 36 episodes. During this period, she also guest-starred on other television series such as &quot;The Untouchables&quot; and four episodes of &quot;Wagon Train&quot;.

She stepped back into film for the 1964 Elvis Presley film &quot;Roustabout&quot;, in which she plays a carnival owner.
 
The Western television series &quot;The Big Valley&quot;, which was broadcast on ABC from 1965 to 1969, made Stanwyck one of the most popular actresses on television, winning her another Emmy. She was billed in the series&#x27; opening credits as Miss Barbara Stanwyck for her role as Victoria, the widowed matriarch of the wealthy Barkley family.

In 1983, Stanwyck won an Emmy for &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;, her third such award. In 1985, she made three guest appearances in the primetime soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot; prior to the launch of its short-lived spinoff series &quot;The Colbys&quot;, in which she starred alongside Charlton Heston, Stephanie Beacham and Katharine Ross. Unhappy with the experience, Stanwyck remained with the series for only the first season, and her role as Constance Colby Patterson would be her last. It was rumored that Earl Hamner Jr., former producer of &quot;The Waltons&quot;, had initially wanted Stanwyck for the role of Angela Channing in the 1980s soap opera &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, and she turned it down, with the role going to her friend Jane Wyman, but Hamner assured Wyman that it was only a rumor.

==Personal life==

===Marriages and relationships===

While playing in &quot;The Noose&quot;, Stanwyck reportedly fell in love with her married co-star Rex Cherryman. When Cherryman took ill in early 1928, his doctor advised him to take a sea voyage, so Cherryman set sail for Le Havre intending to continue on to Paris, where he and Stanwyck had arranged to meet. While at sea he contracted septic poisoning and died shortly after arriving in France at the age of 31.

On August 26, 1928, Stanwyck married her &quot;Burlesque&quot; co-star Frank Fay. She and Fay later claimed that they had disliked each other at first, but became close after Cherryman&#x27;s death. Fay was Catholic so Stanwyck converted for their marriage. She was reportedly unable to have children, and one biographer alleges the cause of her infertility was a botched abortion at the age of 15 that resulted in complications. After moving to Hollywood, the couple adopted a ten-month-old boy on December 5, 1932. They named him Dion, later amending the name to Anthony Dion, nicknamed Tony. The marriage was troubled; Fay&#x27;s successful Broadway career did not translate to the big screen, whereas Stanwyck achieved Hollywood stardom. Fay was reportedly physically abusive to Stanwyck, especially when he was inebriated. Some claim that the marriage was the basis for dialogue written by William Wellman, a friend of the couple, for &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1937) starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March. The couple divorced on December 30, 1935. Stanwyck won custody of their son, whom she raised with a strict, authoritarian hand and demanding expectations. Stanwyck and her son became estranged after his childhood, meeting only a few times after he became an adult. He died in 2006. Wrote Richard Corliss, the child &quot;resembled her in just one respect: both were, effectively, orphans.&quot;

In 1936, while making the film &quot;His Brother&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1936), Stanwyck became involved with her co-star, Robert Taylor. Rather than a torrid romance, their relationship was more one of mentor and pupil. Stanwyck served as support and adviser to the younger Taylor, who had come from a small Nebraska town; she guided his career and acclimated him to the sophisticated Hollywood culture. The couple began living together, sparking newspaper reports. Stanwyck was hesitant to remarry after the failure of her first marriage, but their 1939 marriage was arranged with the help of Taylor&#x27;s studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, a common practice in Hollywood&#x27;s golden age. Louis B. Mayer had insisted that Stanwyck and Taylor marry and went as far as presiding over arrangements at the wedding. Stanwyck and Taylor enjoyed time together outdoors during the early years of their marriage and owned acres of prime West Los Angeles property. Their large ranch and home in the Mandeville Canyon section of Brentwood, Los Angeles, is still referred to by the locals as &quot;the old Robert Taylor ranch&quot;.

Stanwyck and Taylor decided in 1950 to divorce and, at his insistence, she proceeded with the official filing of the papers. There have been many rumors regarding the cause of the divorce, but after World War II Taylor attempted to create a life away from the entertainment industry, and Stanwyck did not share that goal. Taylor allegedly had extramarital affairs, and unsubstantiated rumors suggested that Stanwyck had also. After the divorce, they remained friendly and acted together in Stanwyck&#x27;s last feature film, &quot;The Night Walker&quot; (1964). She never remarried. According to her friend and &quot;Big Valley&quot; co-star Linda Evans, Stanwyck cited Taylor as the love of her life. She took his death in 1969 very hard, and took a long break from film and television work.

Stanwyck was one of the best-liked actresses in Hollywood and maintained friendships with many of her fellow actors (as well as crew members of her films and TV shows), including Joel McCrea and his wife Frances Dee, George Brent, Robert Preston, Henry Fonda (who had a longtime crush on her), James Stewart, Linda Evans, Joan Crawford, Jack Benny and his wife Mary Livingstone, William Holden, Gary Cooper, and Fred MacMurray. During filming of &quot;To Please a Lady&quot;, Stanwyck refused to leave her African-American maid Harriet Coray in a hotel only for African-American people and insisted that Harriet stay in the same hotel as she did. After much pressure from Stanwyck, Coray was allowed to stay in the best hotel in Indianapolis with Stanwyck and the rest of the cast and crew.

Stanwyck, at age 45, had a four-year romantic affair with 22-year-old actor Robert Wagner that had begun on the set of &quot;Titanic&quot; (1953) before Stanwyck ended the relationship. The affair is described in Wagner&#x27;s 2008 memoir &quot;Pieces of My Heart&quot;.

===Political views===
A conservative Republican, Stanwyck opposed the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt. She felt that if someone from her disadvantaged background had risen to success, others should be able to prosper without government intervention or assistance. For Stanwyck, &quot;hard work with the prospect of rich reward was the American way.&quot; She became an early member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals (MPA) after its founding in 1944. The mission of this group was to &quot;combat ... subversive methods [used in the industry] to undermine and change the American way of life.&quot; It opposed both communist and fascist influences in Hollywood. She publicly supported the investigations of the House Un-American Activities Committee, and her husband Robert Taylor testified as a friendly witness. Stanwyck supported Thomas E. Dewey in the 1944 and 1948 United States presidential elections.

A fan of Objectivist author Ayn Rand, Stanwyck persuaded Warner Bros. head Jack L. Warner to purchase the rights to &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; before it became a bestseller, and she wrote to Rand of her admiration of &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;.

===Religion===
Stanwyck was originally a Protestant, and was baptized in June 1916 by the Reverend J. Frederic Berg of the Protestant Dutch Reformed Church. She converted to Roman Catholicism when she married first husband Frank Fay but does not appear to have remained an adherent after the marriage ended.

===Brother===
Stanwyck&#x27;s older brother, Malcolm Byron Stevens (1905–1964), became an actor, using the name Bert Stevens. He appeared mostly in supporting roles, often uncredited. He appeared in two films that starred Stanwyck: &quot;The File on Thelma Jordon&quot; and &quot;No Man of Her Own&quot;, both released in 1950. He appeared in two episodes of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;: (Season 6 Episode 8 (1960): &quot;O Youth and Beauty!&quot; as uncredited Club Member) and (Season 7 Episode 21 (1962): &quot;Burglar Proof&quot; as uncredited Demonstration Guest). He also appeared in one episode of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;: (Season 2 Episode 25 (1964): &quot;The Ordeal of Mrs. Snow&quot; as uncredited Carl the Butler).

==Later years and death==
Stanwyck&#x27;s retirement years were active, with charity work outside the limelight.

In 1981, in her home in the exclusive Trousdale section of Beverly Hills, she was awakened during the night by an intruder who struck her on the head with his flashlight, forced her into a closet, and absconded with $40,000 in jewels.

In 1982, while filming &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;, Stanwyck inhaled special-effects smoke on the set that may have caused her to contract bronchitis, which was compounded by her cigarette-smoking habit. She began smoking at the age of nine and stopped just four years before her death.

Stanwyck died on January 20, 1990, at the age of 82, from congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. She had indicated that she wanted no funeral service. In accordance with her wishes, her remains were cremated and the ashes scattered from a helicopter over Lone Pine, California, where she had made some of her Western films.

<doc id="43333" wikidata="Q3058218" url="?curid=43333" title="Measurable space">
<text>In mathematics, a measurable space or Borel space is a basic object in measure theory. It consists of a set and a σ-algebra, which defines the subsets that will be measured.

It captures and generalises intuitive notions such as length, area, and volume with a set formula_1 of &#x27;points&#x27; in the space, but &quot;regions&quot; of the space are the elements of the σ-algebra, since the intuitive measures are not usually defined for points. The algebra also captures the relationships that might be expected of regions: that a region can be defined as an intersection of other regions, a union of other regions, or the space with the exception of another region.

==Definition==

Consider a set formula_1 and a σ-algebra formula_3 on formula_4 Then the tuple formula_5 is called a measurable space. The elements of formula_3 are called measurable sets within the measurable space.

Note that in contrast to a measure space, no measure is needed for a measurable space.

==Example==

Look at the set:
formula_7
One possible formula_8-algebra would be:
formula_9
Then formula_10 is a measurable space. Another possible formula_8-algebra would be the power set on formula_1:
formula_13
With this, a second measurable space on the set formula_1 is given by formula_15

==Common measurable spaces==

If formula_1 is finite or countably infinite, the formula_8-algebra is most often the power set on formula_18 so formula_19 This leads to the measurable space formula_20

If formula_1 is a topological space, the formula_8-algebra is most commonly the Borel formula_8-algebra formula_24 so formula_25 This leads to the measurable space formula_26 that is common for all topological spaces such as the real numbers formula_27

==Ambiguity with Borel spaces==

The term Borel space is used for different types of measurable spaces. It can refer to
* any measurable space, so it is a synonym for a measurable space as defined above 
* a measurable space that is Borel isomorphic to a measurable subset of the real numbers (again with the Borel formula_8-algebra)

<text>X.25 is an ITU-T standard protocol suite for packet-switched data communication in wide area networks (WAN). It was originally defined by the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT, now ITU-T) in a series of drafts and finalized in a publication known as &quot;The Orange Book&quot; in 1976. 

The protocol suite is designed as three conceptual layers, which correspond closely to the lower three layers of the seven-layer OSI Reference Model, although it was developed several years before the OSI model (1984). It also supports functionality not found in the OSI network layer. An X.25 WAN consists of packet-switching exchange (PSE) nodes as the networking hardware, and leased lines, plain old telephone service connections, or ISDN connections as physical links. 

X.25 was popular with telecommunications companies for their public data networks from the late 1970s to 1990s, which provided worldwide coverage. It was also used in financial transaction systems, such as automated teller machines, and by the credit card payment industry. However, most users have since moved to the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP). X.25 is still used, for example by the aviation industry.

==History==
The CCITT (later ITU-T), the organization responsible for international standardization of telecom services, began developing a standard for packet-switched data communication in the mid-1970s based upon a number of emerging data network projects. Participants in the design of X.25 included engineers from Canada, France, Japan, the UK, and the USA representing a mix of national PTTs (France, Japan, UK) and private operators (Canada, USA). In particular, the work of Rémi Després, contributed significantly to the standard, which was based on a virtual circuit service. A few minor changes, which complemented the proposed specification, were accommodated to enable Larry Roberts to join the agreement. Various updates and additions were worked into the standard, eventually recorded in the ITU series of technical books describing the telecommunication systems. These books were published every fourth year with different-colored covers. The X.25 specification is part of the larger set of X-Series.

=== How the CCITT standardized virtual circuits ===
The CCITT appointed a special Rapporteur on packet switching, Halvor Bothner-By, who held an initial meeting in January 1974. This resulted in a question, to be answered by study group (SG) VII for the next CCITT plenary in 1976, which was “Should the packet-node of operation be provided on public data networks and, if so, how should it be implemented?”. A list of packet switching networks “to be considered” was provided: ARPANET (of the ARPA in the USA), EIN (of the European COST), EPSS (of the British Post Office Telecommunications),RCP (of the French PTT), CYCLADES (of IRIA in France), the NPL network (of the NPL in the UK), the SWIFT network (of the international SWIFT society), and the SITA network (of the international SITA company).

The second Rapporteur meeting, hosted in Oslo by the Norwegian Telecommunications Administration in November 1974, gathered 24 participants, including representatives of other international organizations (ISO, IFIP, ECMA). A document submitted by France “with the active support of a number of European administrations” served as “main basis for discussion in this meeting”. It was then “agreed that two types of services should be considered, a ‘datagram’ service and a ‘virtual call’ service”.

At the third meeting, focus had moved from whether there should be packet-mode networks to whether there could be “a standard for the interface between the network and the computers”.

Starting in January 1975, several bilateral and multilateral meetings took place between network operators having commitments for a packet switching service, in view to draft a common interface specification. Meetings started between the Canadian DATAPAC and the French TRANSPAC, continued with the startup Telenet of the USA, and continued with the BPO of the UK.

In March 1975, Halvor Bothner-By produced a list of recommendations to be created, or simply updated, for a packet switching standard to become possible. It was used as a framework at a drafting meeting in Ottawa between engineers of the four operators wishing to have a standard as soon as possible in the USA, Canada, France, UK and Japan. They prepared contributions to be submitted to SG VII in their name by administrations having voting right in CCITT. One contribution was a X.2x interface specification, the first version of what will become X.25).

The fourth Rapporteur meeting, in May 1975 in Geneva, had 45 participants and 27 new documents. The Rapporteur asked whether packet switching recommendations should be issued &quot;with a view to making international interworking possible”, &quot;the French administration answered in the affirmative and Canada strongly supported the French proposal&quot;. No firm conclusion was however obtained yet.

The fifth Rapporteur meeting, in September 1975 in Geneva, had about 60 participants. After discussions on the proposed virtual circuit interface, numerous issues were left unresolved. Concerning datagrams, ‘It was proposed by Larry Roberts of the US delegation and supported by representatives from France and Canada respectively that the datagram classification be changed from “E” to “A”’, i.e., from essential &quot;to be available internationally” to additional that &quot;may be available in certain countries and internationally”. The Rapporteur&#x27;s last report expressed doubts “that a standard would be ready for adoption by SG VII”.

At the last meeting of the full SG VII before the CCITT plenary of September 1976, the available draft X.25 raised numerous clarification questions and/or and technical objections. SG VII&#x27;s chairman Vern MacDonald appointed an editor and provided a meeting facility for the weekend. After intense work during it, all issues had been dealt with. For an approval by the full study group, a challenge remained: copies of the updated X.25 draft had to be available in two languages. To get them in due time, Tony Rybczynski of DATAPAC and Paul Guinaudeau of TRANSPAC spent a full night to handwrite all negotiated amendments, and to assemble them with paste and scissors into clean documents. COM VII then reviewed distributed copies, and unanimously approved them for submission to the forthcoming CCITT plenary. At this plenary of September 1976, the X.25 recommendation and the other 10 of SG VII were unanimously approved.

As requested by the USA, an optional datagram service was added to the revised X.25 of 1980, together with an alignment of its link layer, now called LAPB, with a recent evolution of HDLC in ISO. In absence of any public network operator implementing this option, datagrams were finally deleted from X.25 in its update of 1984.

=== Worldwide public data networks ===

Publicly accessible X.25 networks, commonly called public data networks, were set up in many countries during the late 1970s and 1980s to lower the cost of accessing various online services. Examples include Iberpac, TRANSPAC, Compuserve, Tymnet, Telenet, Euronet, PSS, Datapac, Datanet 1 and AUSTPAC as well as the International Packet Switched Service. Their combined network had large global coverage during the 1980s and into the 1990s.

Beginning in the early 1990s, in North America, use of X.25 networks (predominated by Telenet and Tymnet) started to be replaced by Frame Relay services offered by national telephone companies. Most systems that required X.25 now use TCP/IP, however it is possible to transport X.25 over TCP/IP when necessary.

X.25 networks are still in use throughout the world. A variant called AX.25 is used widely by amateur packet radio. Racal Paknet, now known as Widanet, remains in operation in many regions of the world, running on an X.25 protocol base. In some countries, like the Netherlands or Germany, it is possible to use a stripped version of X.25 via the D-channel of an ISDN-2 (or ISDN BRI) connection for low-volume applications such as point-of-sale terminals; but, the future of this service in the Netherlands is uncertain.

X.25 is still used in the aeronautical business (especially in Asia) even though a transition to modern protocols is increasingly important as X.25 hardware becomes increasingly rare and costly. As recently as March 2006, the United States National Airspace Data Interchange Network has used X.25 to interconnect remote airfields with air route traffic control centers.

France was one of the last remaining countries where commercial end-user service based on X.25 operated. Known as Minitel it was based on Videotex, itself running on X.25. In 2002, Minitel had about 9 million users, and in 2011 it accounted for about 2 million users in France when France Télécom announced it would shut down the service by 30 June 2012. As planned, service was terminated 30 June 2012. There were 800,000 terminals in operation at the time. An X.25 service was still purchasable from BT in the United Kingdom in 2019.

==Architecture==
The general concept of the X.25 was to create a universal and global packet-switched network. Much of the X.25 system is a description of the rigorous error correction needed to achieve this, as well as more efficient sharing of capital-intensive physical resources.

The X.25 specification defines only the interface between a subscriber (DTE) and an X.25 network (DCE). X.75, a protocol very similar to X.25, defines the interface between two X.25 networks to allow connections to traverse two or more networks. X.25 does not specify how the network operates internally many X.25 network implementations used something very similar to X.25 or X.75 internally, but others used quite different protocols internally. The ISO protocol equivalent to X.25, ISO 8208, is compatible with X.25, but additionally includes provision for two X.25 DTEs to be directly connected to each other with no network in between. By separating the Packet-Layer Protocol, ISO 8208 permits operation over additional networks such as ISO 8802 LLC2 (ISO LAN) and the OSI data link layer.

X.25 originally defined three basic protocol levels or architectural layers. In the original specifications these were referred to as &quot;levels&quot; and also had a level number, whereas all ITU-T X.25 recommendations and ISO 8208 standards released after 1984 refer to them as &quot;layers&quot;. The layer numbers were dropped to avoid confusion with the OSI Model layers.

* Physical layer: This layer specifies the physical, electrical, functional and procedural characteristics to control the physical link between a DTE and a DCE. Common implementations use X.21, EIA-232, EIA-449 or other serial protocols.
* Data link layer: The data link layer consists of the link access procedure for data interchange on the link between a DTE and a DCE. In its implementation, the Link Access Procedure, Balanced (LAPB) is a data link protocol that manages a communication session and controls the packet framing. It is a bit-oriented protocol that provides error correction and orderly delivery.
* Packet layer: This layer defined a packet-layer protocol for exchanging control and user data packets to form a packet-switching network based on virtual calls, according to the Packet Layer Protocol.

The X.25 model was based on the traditional telephony concept of establishing reliable circuits through a shared network, but using software to create &quot;virtual calls&quot; through the network. These calls interconnect &quot;data terminal equipment&quot; (DTE) providing endpoints to users, which looked like point-to-point connections. Each endpoint can establish many separate virtual calls to different endpoints.

For a brief period, the specification also included a connectionless datagram service, but this was dropped in the next revision. The &quot;fast select with restricted response facility&quot; is intermediate between full call establishment and connectionless communication. It is widely used in query-response transaction applications involving a single request and response limited to 128 bytes of data carried each way. The data is carried in an extended call request packet and the response is carried in an extended field of the call reject packet, with a connection never being fully established.

Closely related to the X.25 protocol are the protocols to connect asynchronous devices (such as dumb terminals and printers) to an X.25 network: X.3, X.28 and X.29. This functionality was performed using a packet assembler/disassembler or PAD (also known as a &quot;triple-X device&quot;, referring to the three protocols used).

===Relation to the OSI Reference Model===
Although X.25 predates the OSI Reference Model (OSIRM), the physical layer of the OSI model corresponds to the X.25 &quot;physical layer&quot;, the data link layer to the X.25 &quot;data link layer&quot;, and the network layer to the X.25 &quot;packet layer&quot;. The X.25 &quot;data link layer&quot;, LAPB, provides a reliable data path across a data link (or multiple parallel data links, multilink) which may not be reliable itself. The X.25 &quot;packet layer&quot; provides the virtual call mechanisms, running over X.25 LAPB. The &quot;packet layer&quot; includes mechanisms to maintain virtual calls and to signal data errors in the event that the &quot;data link layer&quot; cannot recover from data transmission errors. All but the earliest versions of X.25 include facilities which provide for OSI network layer Addressing (NSAP addressing, see below).

===User device support===

X.25 was developed in the era of computer terminals connecting to host computers, although it also can be used for communications between computers. Instead of dialing directly “into” the host computer which would require the host to have its own pool of modems and phone lines, and require non-local callers to make long-distance calls the host could have an X.25 connection to a network service provider. Now dumb-terminal users could dial into the network&#x27;s local “PAD” (packet assembly/disassembly facility), a gateway device connecting modems and serial lines to the X.25 link as defined by the X.29 and X.3 standards.

Having connected to the PAD, the dumb-terminal user tells the PAD which host to connect to, by giving a phone-number-like address in the X.121 address format (or by giving a host name, if the service provider allows for names that map to X.121 addresses). The PAD then places an X.25 call to the host, establishing a virtual call. Note that X.25 provides for virtual calls, so &quot;appears&quot; to be a circuit switched network, even though in fact the data itself is packet switched internally, similar to the way TCP provides connections even though the underlying data is packet switched. Two X.25 hosts could, of course, call one another directly; no PAD is involved in this case. In theory, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether the X.25 caller and X.25 destination are both connected to the same carrier, but in practice it was not always possible to make calls from one carrier to another.

For the purpose of flow-control, a sliding window protocol is used with the default window size of 2. The acknowledgements may have either local or end to end significance. A D bit (Data Delivery bit) in each data packet indicates if the sender requires end to end acknowledgement. When D=1, it means that the acknowledgement has end to end significance and must take place only after the remote DTE has acknowledged receipt of the data. When D=0, the network is permitted (but not required) to acknowledge before the remote DTE has acknowledged or even received the data.

While the PAD function defined by X.28 and X.29 specifically supported asynchronous character terminals, PAD equivalents were developed to support a wide range of proprietary intelligent communications devices, such as those for IBM System Network Architecture (SNA).

===Error control===
Error recovery procedures at the packet layer assume that the data link layer is responsible for retransmitting data received in error. Packet layer error handling focuses on resynchronizing the information flow in calls, as well as clearing calls that have gone into unrecoverable states:

* Level 3 Reset packets, which re-initializes the flow on a virtual call (but does not break the virtual call).
* Restart packet, which clears down all virtual calls on the data link and resets all permanent virtual circuits on the data link.

==Addressing and virtual circuits==
X.25 supports two types of virtual circuits; virtual calls (VC) and permanent virtual circuits (PVC). Virtual calls are established on an as-needed basis. For example, a VC is established when a call is placed and torn down after the call is complete. VCs are established through a call establishment and clearing procedure. On the other hand, permanent virtual circuits are preconfigured into the network. PVCs are seldom torn down and thus provide a dedicated connection between end points.

VC may be established using X.121 addresses. The X.121 address consists of a three-digit data country code (DCC) plus a network digit, together forming the four-digit data network identification code (DNIC), followed by the national terminal number (NTN) of at most ten digits. Note the use of a single network digit, seemingly allowing for only 10 network carriers per country, but some countries are assigned more than one DCC to avoid this limitation. Networks often used fewer than the full NTN digits for routing, and made the spare digits available to the subscriber (sometimes called the sub-address) where they could be used to identify applications or for further routing on the subscribers networks.

NSAP addressing facility was added in the X.25(1984) revision of the specification, and this enabled X.25 to better meet the requirements of OSI Connection Oriented Network Service (CONS). Public X.25 networks were not required to make use of NSAP addressing, but, to support OSI CONS, were required to carry the NSAP addresses and other ITU-T specified DTE facilities transparently from DTE to DTE. Later revisions allowed multiple addresses in addition to X.121 addresses to be carried on the same DTE-DCE interface: Telex addressing (F.69), PSTN addressing (E.163), ISDN addressing (E.164), Internet Protocol addresses (IANA ICP), and local IEEE 802.2 MAC addresses.

PVCs are permanently established in the network and therefore do not require the use of addresses for call setup. PVCs are identified at the subscriber interface by their logical channel identifier (see below). However, in practice not many of the national X.25 networks supported PVCs.

One DTE-DCE interface to an X.25 network has a maximum of 4095 logical channels on which it is allowed to establish virtual calls and permanent virtual circuits, although networks are not expected to support a full 4095 virtual circuits. For identifying the channel to which a packet is associated, each packet contains a 12 bit logical channel identifier made up of an 8-bit logical channel number and a 4-bit logical channel group number. Logical channel identifiers remain assigned to a virtual circuit for the duration of the connection. Logical channel identifiers identify a specific logical channel between the DTE (subscriber appliance) and the DCE (network), and only has local significance on the link between the subscriber and the network. The other end of the connection at the remote DTE is likely to have assigned a different logical channel identifier. The range of possible logical channels is split into 4 groups: channels assigned to permanent virtual circuits, assigned to incoming virtual calls, two-way (incoming or outgoing) virtual calls, and outgoing virtual calls. (Directions refer to the direction of virtual call initiation as viewed by the DTE they all carry data in both directions.) The ranges allowed a subscriber to be configured to handle significantly differing numbers of calls in each direction while reserving some channels for calls in one direction. All international networks are required to implement support for permanent virtual circuits, two-way logical channels and one-way logical channels outgoing; one-way logical channels incoming is an additional optional facility. DTE-DCE interfaces are not required to support more than one logical channel. Logical channel identifier zero will not be assigned to a permanent virtual circuit or virtual call. The logical channel identifier of zero is used for packets which don&#x27;t relate to a specific virtual circuit (e.g. packet layer restart, registration, and diagnostic packets).

==Billing==
In public networks, X.25 was typically billed as a flat monthly service fee depending on link speed, and then a price-per-segment on top of this. Link speeds varied, typically from 2400 bit/s up to 2 Mbit/s, although speeds above 64 kbit/s were uncommon in the public networks. A segment was 64 bytes of data (rounded up, with no carry-over between packets), charged to the caller (or callee in the case of reverse charged calls, where supported). Calls invoking the &quot;Fast Select&quot; facility (allowing 128 bytes of data in call request, call confirmation and call clearing phases) would generally attract an extra charge, as might use of some of the other X.25 facilities. PVCs would have a monthly rental charge and a lower price-per-segment than VCs, making them cheaper only where large volumes of data are passed.

==X.25 packet types==
==X.25 details==
The network may allow the selection of the maximal length in range 16 to 4096 octets (2n values only) per virtual circuit by negotiation as part of the call setup procedure. The maximal length may be different at the two ends of the virtual circuit.
*Data terminal equipment constructs control packets which are encapsulated into data packets. The packets are sent to the data circuit-terminating equipment, using LAPB Protocol.
*Data circuit-terminating equipment strips the layer-2 headers in order to encapsulate packets to the internal network protocol.

===X.25 facilities===
X.25 provides a set of user facilities defined and described in ITU-T Recommendation X.2. The X.2 user facilities fall into five categories:

* Essential facilities;
* Additional facilities;
* Conditional facilities;
* Mandatory facilities; and,
* Optional facilities.

X.25 also provides X.25 and ITU-T specified DTE optional user facilities defined and described in ITU-T Recommendation X.7. The X.7 optional user facilities fall into four categories of user facilities that require:

* Subscription only;
* Subscription followed by dynamic invocation;
* Subscription or dynamic invocation; and,
* Dynamic invocation only.

===X.25 protocol versions===
The CCITT/ITU-T versions of the protocol specifications are for public data networks (PDN). The ISO/IEC versions address additional features for private networks (e.g. local area networks (LAN) use) while maintaining compatibility with the CCITT/ITU-T specifications.

The user facilities and other features supported by each version of X.25 and ISO/IEC 8208 have varied from edition to edition. Several major protocol versions of X.25 exist:

* CCITT Recommendation X.25 (1976) Orange Book
* CCITT Recommendation X.25 (1980) Yellow Book
* CCITT Recommendation X.25 (1984) Red Book
* CCITT Recommendation X.25 (1988) Blue Book
* ITU-T Recommendation X.25 (1993) White Book
* ITU-T Recommendation X.25 (1996) Grey Book

The X.25 Recommendation allows many options for each network to choose when deciding which features to support and how certain operations are performed. This means each network needs to publish its own document giving the specification of its X.25 implementation, and most networks required DTE appliance manufacturers to undertake protocol conformance testing, which included testing for strict adherence and enforcement of their network specific options. (Network operators were particularly concerned about the possibility of a badly behaving or misconfigured DTE appliance taking out parts of the network and affecting other subscribers.) Therefore, subscriber&#x27;s DTE appliances have to be configured to match the specification of the particular network to which they are connecting. Most of these were sufficiently different to prevent interworking if the subscriber didn&#x27;t configure their appliance correctly or the appliance manufacturer didn&#x27;t include specific support for that network. In spite of protocol conformance testing, this often lead to interworking problems when initially attaching an appliance to a network.

In addition to the CCITT/ITU-T versions of the protocol, four editions of ISO/IEC 8208 exist:

* ISO/IEC 8208:1987, First Edition, compatible with X.25 (1980) and (1984)
* ISO/IEC 8208:1990, Second Edition, compatible with 1st Ed. and X.25 (1988)
* ISO/IEC 8208:1995, Third Edition, compatible with 2nd Ed. and X.25 (1993)
* ISO/IEC 8208:2000, Fourth Edition, compatible with 3rd Ed. and X.25 (1996)

== Legacy ==
The X.25 protocol had a lot of overhead to deal with data loss, since circuits back then ran over poor-grade cabling and had a lot of single-bit errors to deal with. As circuits became more and more reliable, the overhead was no longer needed, and less expensive Frame Relay took over. Frame Relay has its technical base in X.25, but does not attempt to correct errors.

The world-wide public data networks based on X.25 helped grow IP as a protocol riding on top. 

X.25 was also available in niche applications such as Retronet that allow vintage computers to use the Internet.

<text>Katharine Houghton Hepburn (May 12, 1907 – June 29, 2003) was an American actress whose career as a Hollywood leading lady spanned six decades. She was known for her headstrong independence, spirited personality, and outspokenness, cultivating a screen persona that matched this public image, and regularly playing strong-willed, sophisticated women. She worked in a varied range of genres, from screwball comedy to literary drama, which earned her various accolades, including four Academy Awards for Best Actress—a record for any performer.

Raised in Connecticut by wealthy, progressive parents, Hepburn began to act while at Bryn Mawr College. Favorable reviews of her work on Broadway brought her to the attention of Hollywood. Her early years in film brought her international fame, including an Academy Award for Best Actress for her third film, &quot;Morning Glory&quot; (1933), but this was followed by a series of commercial failures culminating in the critically lauded box office failure &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938). Hepburn masterminded her comeback, buying out her contract with RKO Radio Pictures and acquiring the film rights to &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;, which she sold on the condition that she be the star. That comedy film was a box office success and landed her a third Academy Award nomination. In the 1940s, she was contracted to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where her career focused on an alliance with Spencer Tracy. The screen partnership spanned 26 years and produced nine films.

Hepburn challenged herself in the latter half of her life as she tackled Shakespearean stage productions and a range of literary roles. She found a niche playing mature, independent, and sometimes unmarried women such as in &quot;The African Queen&quot; (1951), a persona the public embraced. Hepburn received three more Academy Awards for her performances in &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot; (1967), &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; (1968), and &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; (1981). In the 1970s, she began appearing in television films, which later became her focus. She made her final screen appearance at the age of 87. After a period of inactivity and ill health, Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96.

Hepburn famously shunned the Hollywood publicity machine, and refused to conform to societal expectations of women. She was outspoken, assertive, athletic, and wore pants before it was fashionable. She married once, as a young woman, but thereafter lived independently. A 26-year relationship with her co-star Spencer Tracy was hidden from the public. With her unconventional lifestyle and the independent characters she brought to the screen, Hepburn came to epitomize the &quot;modern woman&quot; in 20th-century America and influenced changing popular perceptions of women. In 1999, she was named the greatest female star of classic Hollywood cinema by the American Film Institute.

== Early life and education ==
Katharine Houghton Hepburn was born on May 12, 1907, in Hartford, Connecticut, the second of six children. Her parents were Thomas Norval Hepburn (1879–1962), a urologist at Hartford Hospital, and Katharine Martha Houghton Hepburn (1878–1951), a feminist campaigner. Both parents fought for social change in the United States: Thomas Hepburn helped establish the New England Social Hygiene Association, which educated the public about venereal disease, while the elder Katharine headed the Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association and later campaigned for birth control with Margaret Sanger. As a child, Hepburn joined her mother on several &quot;Votes For Women&quot; demonstrations. The Hepburn children were raised to exercise freedom of speech and encouraged to think and debate on any topic they wished. Her parents were criticized by the community for their progressive views, which stimulated Hepburn to fight against barriers she encountered. Hepburn said she realized from a young age that she was the product of &quot;two very remarkable parents&quot;, and credited her &quot;enormously lucky&quot; upbringing with providing the foundation for her success. She remained close with her family throughout her life.

The young Hepburn was a tomboy who liked to call herself Jimmy and cut her hair short. Thomas Hepburn was eager for his children to use their minds and bodies to the limit and taught them to swim, run, dive, ride, wrestle, and play golf and tennis. Golf became a passion of Hepburn&#x27;s; she took daily lessons and became very adept, reaching the semi-final of the Connecticut Young Women&#x27;s Golf Championship. She loved swimming in Long Island Sound, and took ice-cold baths every morning in the belief that &quot;the bitterer the medicine, the better it was for you&quot;. Hepburn was a fan of films from a young age and went to see one every Saturday night. She would put on plays and perform for her neighbors with friends and siblings for 50 cents a ticket to raise money for the Navajo people.

In March 1921, Hepburn, 13, and her 15-year-old brother Tom were visiting New York, staying with a friend of their mother&#x27;s in Greenwich Village over the Easter break. On March 30, Hepburn discovered the body of her adored older brother dead from an apparent suicide. He had tied a curtain tie around a beam and hanged himself. The Hepburn family denied it was suicide and maintained that Tom&#x27;s death must have been an experiment that had gone wrong. The incident made the teenage Hepburn nervous, moody, and suspicious of people. She shied away from other children, dropped out of Oxford School (now Kingswood-Oxford School) and was tutored privately. For many years she used Tom&#x27;s birthday (November 8) as her own. It was not until her 1991 autobiography, &quot;Me: Stories of My Life&quot;, that Hepburn revealed her true birth date.

In 1924, Hepburn was admitted to Bryn Mawr College. She initially agreed to attend the institution to satisfy her mother, who had studied there, but ultimately found the experience to be unfulfilling. It was the first time she had been in school for several years, and she was self-conscious and uncomfortable with her classmates. She struggled with the scholastic demands of university, and once was suspended for smoking in her room. Hepburn was drawn to acting, but roles in college plays were conditional on good grades. Once her marks had improved, she began performing regularly. She performed the lead role in a production of &quot;The Woman in the Moon&quot; in her senior year, and the positive response it received cemented Hepburn&#x27;s plans to pursue a theatrical career. She graduated with a degree in history and philosophy in June 1928.

== Career ==

=== Breaking into theatre (1928–1932) ===
Hepburn left university determined to become an actress. The day after graduating, she traveled to Baltimore to meet Edwin H. Knopf, who ran a successful stock theatre company. Impressed by her eagerness, Knopf cast Hepburn in his current production, &quot;The Czarina&quot;. She received good reviews for her small role, and the &quot;Printed Word&quot; described her performance as &quot;arresting&quot;. She was given a part in the following week&#x27;s show, but her second performance was less well received. She was criticized for her shrill voice, so she left Baltimore to study with Frances Robinson-Duff, a renowned voice teacher in New York City.

Knopf decided to produce &quot;The Big Pond&quot; in New York, and appointed Hepburn the understudy to the leading lady. A week before opening, the lead was fired and replaced with Hepburn, which gave her a starring role only four weeks into her theatre career. On opening night, she turned up late, mixed her lines, tripped over her feet, and spoke too quickly to be understood. She was immediately fired, and the original leading lady rehired. Undeterred, Hepburn joined forces with the producer Arthur Hopkins and accepted the role of a schoolgirl in &quot;These Days&quot;. Her Broadway debut came on November 12, 1928, at the Cort Theatre, but reviews for the show were poor, and it closed after eight nights. Hopkins promptly hired Hepburn as the lead understudy in Philip Barry&#x27;s play &quot;Holiday&quot;. In early December, after only two weeks, she quit to marry Ludlow Ogden Smith, a college acquaintance. She planned to leave the theatre behind but began to miss the work and quickly resumed the understudy role in &quot;Holiday&quot;, which she held for six months.

In 1929, Hepburn turned down a role with the Theatre Guild to play the lead in &quot;Death Takes a Holiday&quot;. She felt the role was perfect, but again, she was fired. She went back to the Guild and took an understudy role for minimum pay in &quot;A Month in the Country&quot;. In the spring of 1930, Hepburn joined the Berkshire Playhouse theater company in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. She left halfway through the summer season and continued studying with a drama tutor. In early 1931, she was cast in the Broadway production of &quot;Art and Mrs. Bottle&quot;. She was released from the role after the playwright took a dislike to her, saying &quot;She looks a fright, her manner is objectionable, and she has no talent&quot;, but Hepburn was re-hired when no other actress could be found. It went on to be a small success.

Hepburn appeared in a number of plays with a summer stock company in Ivoryton, Connecticut, and she proved to be a hit. During the summer of 1931, Philip Barry asked her to appear in his new play, &quot;The Animal Kingdom&quot;, alongside Leslie Howard. They began rehearsals in November, Hepburn feeling sure the role would make her a star, but Howard disliked the actress and again she was fired. When she asked Barry why she had been let go, he responded, &quot;Well, to be brutally frank, you weren&#x27;t very good.&quot; This unsettled the self-assured Hepburn, but she continued to look for work. She took a small role in an upcoming play, but as rehearsals began, she was asked to read for the lead in the Greek fable &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Husband&quot;.

&quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Husband&quot; proved to be Hepburn&#x27;s breakout performance. Biographer Charles Higham states that the role was ideal for the actress, requiring an aggressive energy and athleticism, and she enthusiastically involved herself with its production. The play opened March 11, 1932, at the Morosco Theatre on Broadway. Hepburn&#x27;s first entrance called for her to leap down a narrow stairway with a stag over her shoulder, wearing a short silver tunic. The show ran for three months, and Hepburn received positive reviews. Richard Garland of the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s been many a night since so glowing a performance has brightened the Broadway scene.&quot;

=== Hollywood success (1932–1934) ===
A scout for the Hollywood agent Leland Hayward spotted Hepburn&#x27;s appearance in &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Husband&quot;, and asked her to test for the part of Sydney Fairfield in the upcoming RKO film &quot;A Bill of Divorcement&quot;. Director George Cukor was impressed by what he saw: &quot;There was this odd creature&quot;, he recalled, &quot;she was unlike anybody I&#x27;d ever heard.&quot; He particularly liked the manner in which she picked up a glass: &quot;I thought she was very talented in that action.&quot; Offered the role, Hepburn demanded $1,500 a week, a large amount for an unknown actress. Cukor encouraged the studio to accept her demands and they signed Hepburn to a temporary contract with a three-week guarantee. RKO head David O. Selznick recounted that he took a &quot;tremendous chance&quot; in casting the unusual actress.

Hepburn arrived in California in July 1932, at 25 years old. She starred in &quot;A Bill of Divorcement&quot; opposite John Barrymore, but showed no sign of intimidation. Although she struggled to adapt to the nature of film acting, Hepburn was fascinated by the industry from the start. The picture was a success and Hepburn received positive reviews. Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called her performance &quot;exceptionally fine ... Miss Hepburn&#x27;s characterization is one of the finest seen on the screen&quot;. The &quot;Variety&quot; review declared, &quot;Standout here is the smash impression made by Katharine Hepburn in her first picture assignment. She has a vital something that sets her apart from the picture galaxy.&quot; On the strength of &quot;A Bill of Divorcement&quot;, RKO signed her to a long-term contract. George Cukor became a lifetime friend and colleague—he and Hepburn made ten films together.

Hepburn&#x27;s second film was &quot;Christopher Strong&quot; (1933), the story of an aviator and her affair with a married man. The picture was not commercially successful, but Hepburn&#x27;s reviews were good. Regina Crewe wrote in the &quot;Journal-American&quot; that although her mannerisms were grating, &quot;they compel attention, and they fascinate an audience. She is a distinct, definite, positive personality.&quot; Hepburn&#x27;s third picture confirmed her as a major actress in Hollywood. For playing aspiring actress Eva Lovelace—a role intended for Constance Bennett—in &quot;Morning Glory&quot;, she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. She had seen the script on the desk of producer Pandro S. Berman and, convinced that she was born to play the part, insisted that the role be hers. Hepburn chose not to attend the awards ceremony—as she would not for the duration of her career—but was thrilled with the win. Her success continued with the role of Jo in the film &quot;Little Women&quot; (1933). The picture was a hit, one of the film industry&#x27;s biggest successes to date, and Hepburn won the Best Actress prize at the Venice Film Festival. &quot;Little Women&quot; was one of Hepburn&#x27;s personal favorites and she was proud of her performance, later saying, &quot;I defy anyone to be as good [as Jo] as I was&quot;.

By the end of 1933, Hepburn was a respected film actress, but she yearned to prove herself on Broadway. Jed Harris, one of the most successful theatre producers of the 1920s, was going through a career slump. He asked Hepburn to appear in the play &quot;The Lake&quot;, which she agreed to do for a low salary. Before she was given leave, RKO asked that she film &quot;Spitfire&quot; (1934). Hepburn&#x27;s role in the movie was Trigger Hicks, an uneducated mountain girl. Though it did well at the box office, &quot;Spitfire&quot; is widely considered one of Hepburn&#x27;s worst films, and she received poor reviews for the effort. Hepburn kept a photo of herself as Hicks in her bedroom throughout her life to &quot;[keep] me humble&quot;.

&quot;The Lake&quot; previewed in Washington, D.C., where there was a large advance sale. Harris&#x27; poor direction had eroded Hepburn&#x27;s confidence, and she struggled with the performance. Despite this, Harris moved the play to New York without further rehearsal. It opened at the Martin Beck Theatre on December 26, 1933, and Hepburn was roundly panned by the critics. Dorothy Parker quipped, &quot;She runs the gamut of emotions all the way from A to B.&quot; Already tied to a ten-week contract, she had to endure the embarrassment of rapidly declining box office sales. Harris decided to take the show to Chicago, saying to Hepburn, &quot;My dear, the only interest I have in you is the money I can make out of you.&quot; Hepburn did not want to continue in a failing show, so she paid Harris $14,000, most of her life savings, to close the production instead. She later referred to Harris as &quot;hands-down the most diabolical person I have ever met&quot;, and claimed this experience was important in teaching her to take responsibility for her career.

=== Career setbacks (1934–1938) ===
After the failure of &quot;Spitfire&quot; and &quot;The Lake&quot;, RKO cast Hepburn in &quot;The Little Minister&quot; (1934), based on a Victorian novel by James Barrie, in an attempt to repeat the success of &quot;Little Women&quot;. There was no such recurrence, and the picture was a commercial failure. The romantic drama &quot;Break of Hearts&quot; (1935) with Charles Boyer was poorly reviewed and also lost money. After three forgettable films, success returned to Hepburn with &quot;Alice Adams&quot; (1935), the story of a girl&#x27;s desperation to climb the social ladder. Hepburn loved the book and was delighted to be offered the role. The film was a hit, one of Hepburn&#x27;s personal favorites, and gave the actress her second Oscar nomination. She received the second most votes, after winner Bette Davis.

Given the choice of her next feature, Hepburn decided to star in George Cukor&#x27;s new project, &quot;Sylvia Scarlett&quot; (1935), which paired her for the first time with Cary Grant. Her hair was cut short for the part, as her character masquerades as a boy for much of the film. Critics disliked &quot;Sylvia Scarlett&quot; and it was unpopular with the public. She next played Mary Stuart in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Mary of Scotland&quot; (1936), which met with a similarly poor reception. &quot;A Woman Rebels&quot; (1936) followed, a Victorian-era drama where Hepburn&#x27;s character defied convention by having a child out of wedlock. &quot;Quality Street&quot; (1937) also had a period setting, this time a comedy. Neither movie was popular with the public, which meant she had made four unsuccessful pictures in a row.

Alongside a series of unpopular films, problems arose from Hepburn&#x27;s attitude. She had a difficult relationship with the press, with whom she could be rude and provocative. When asked if she had any children, she snapped back, &quot;Yes, I have five: two white and three colored.&quot; She would not give interviews and denied requests for autographs, which earned her the nickname &quot;Katharine of Arrogance&quot;. The public was also baffled by her boyish behavior and fashion choices, and she became a largely unpopular figure. Hepburn sensed that she needed to leave Hollywood, so she returned east to star in a theatrical adaptation of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. It had a successful tour, but, uncertain about the script and unwilling to risk failure after the disaster of &quot;The Lake&quot;, Hepburn decided against taking the show to Broadway. Towards the end of 1936, Hepburn vied for the role of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Producer David O. Selznick refused to offer her the part because he felt she had no sex appeal. He reportedly told Hepburn, &quot;I can&#x27;t see Rhett Butler chasing you for twelve years.&quot;

Hepburn&#x27;s next feature, &quot;Stage Door&quot; (1937), paired her with Ginger Rogers in a role that mirrored her own life—that of a wealthy society girl trying to make it as an actress. Hepburn was praised for her work at early previews, which gave her top billing over Rogers. The film was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, but it was not the box-office hit RKO had hoped for. Industry pundits blamed Hepburn for the small profit, but the studio continued its commitment to resurrecting her popularity. She was cast in Howard Hawks&#x27; screwball comedy &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938), where she played a flighty heiress who loses a leopard while trying to woo a palaeontologist (Cary Grant). She approached the physical comedy of the film with confidence, and took tips on comedic timing from her co-star Walter Catlett. &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; was acclaimed by critics, but it was nevertheless unsuccessful at the box office. With the genre and Grant both hugely popular at the time, biographer A. Scott Berg believes the blame lay with moviegoers&#x27; rejection of Hepburn.

After the release of &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;, the Independent Theatre Owners of America included Hepburn on a list of actors considered &quot;box office poison&quot;. Her reputation at a low, the next film RKO offered her was &quot;Mother Carey&#x27;s Chickens&quot;, a B movie with poor prospects. Hepburn turned it down, and instead opted to buy out her contract for $75,000. Many actors were afraid to leave the stability of the studio system at the time, but Hepburn&#x27;s personal wealth meant she could afford to be independent. She signed on for the film version of &quot;Holiday&quot; (1938) with Columbia Pictures, pairing her for the third time with Grant, to play a stifled society girl who finds joy with her sister&#x27;s fiancé. The comedy was positively reviewed, but it failed to draw much of an audience, and the next script offered to Hepburn came with a salary of $10,000—less than she had received at the start of her film career. Reflecting on this change in fortunes, Andrew Britton writes of Hepburn, &quot;No other star has emerged with greater rapidity or with more ecstatic acclaim. No other star, either, has become so unpopular so quickly for so long a time.&quot;

=== Revival (1939–1942) ===

Following this decline in her career, Hepburn took action to create her own comeback vehicle. She left Hollywood to look for a stage project, and signed on to star in Philip Barry&#x27;s new play, &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;. It was tailored to showcase the actress, with the character of socialite Tracy Lord incorporating a mixture of humor, aggression, nervousness, and vulnerability. Howard Hughes, Hepburn&#x27;s partner at the time, sensed that the play could be her ticket back to Hollywood stardom and bought her the film rights before it even debuted on stage. &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; first toured the United States, to positive reviews, and then opened in New York at the Shubert Theatre on March 28, 1939. It was a big hit, critically and financially, running for 417 performances and then going on a second successful tour.

Several of the major film studios approached Hepburn to produce the movie version of Barry&#x27;s play. She chose to sell the rights to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Hollywood&#x27;s number one studio, on the condition that she be the star. As part of the deal she also received the director of her choice, George Cukor, and picked James Stewart and Cary Grant (to whom she ceded top-billing) as co-stars. Before filming began, Hepburn shrewdly noted, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to make a grand entrance in this picture. Moviegoers ... think I&#x27;m too la-di-da or something. A lot of people want to see me fall flat on my face.&quot; Thus the film began with Grant knocking the actress flat on her backside. Berg describes how the character was crafted to have audiences &quot;laugh at her enough that they would ultimately sympathize with her&quot;, which Hepburn felt was crucial in &quot;recreating&quot; her public image. &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; was one of the biggest hits of 1940, breaking records at Radio City Music Hall. The review in &quot;Time&quot; declared, &quot;Come on back, Katie, all is forgiven.&quot; Herb Golden of &quot;Variety&quot; stated, &quot;It&#x27;s Katharine Hepburn&#x27;s picture ... The perfect conception of all flighty, but characterful, Main Line socialite gals rolled into one, the story without her is almost inconceivable.&quot; Hepburn was nominated for her third Academy Award for Best Actress, and won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress while Stewart won his only Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance.

Hepburn was also responsible for the development of her next project, the romantic comedy &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; about a political columnist and a sports reporter whose relationship is threatened by her self-centered independence. The idea for the film was proposed to her in 1941 by Garson Kanin, who recalled how Hepburn contributed to the script. She presented the finished product to MGM and demanded $250,000—half for her, half for the authors. Her terms accepted, Hepburn was also given the director and co-star of her choice, George Stevens and Spencer Tracy. On Hepburn and Tracy&#x27;s first day on set together, she allegedly told Tracy &quot;I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m too tall for you&quot; to which Tracy replied, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry Miss Hepburn, I&#x27;ll soon cut you down to my size.&quot; It started a relationship on screen and off that lasted until Tracy&#x27;s death in 1967 with them appearing in another eight films together. Released in 1942, &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; was another success. Critics praised the chemistry between the stars, and, says Higham, noted Hepburn&#x27;s &quot;increasing maturity and polish&quot;. The &quot;World-Telegram&quot; commended two &quot;brilliant performances&quot;, and Hepburn received a fourth Academy Award nomination. During the course of the movie, Hepburn signed a star contract with MGM.

=== Slowing in the 1940s (1942–1949) ===
In 1942, Hepburn returned to Broadway to appear in another Philip Barry play, &quot;Without Love&quot;, which was also written with the actress in mind. Critics were unenthusiastic about the production, but with Hepburn&#x27;s popularity at a high, it ran for 16 sold-out weeks. MGM was eager to reunite Tracy and Hepburn for a new picture and settled on &quot;Keeper of the Flame&quot; (1942). A dark mystery with a propaganda message on the dangers of fascism, the film was seen by Hepburn as an opportunity to make a worthy political statement. It received poor notices, but was a financial success, confirming the popularity of the Tracy–Hepburn pairing.

Since &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;, Hepburn had committed to a romantic relationship with Tracy and dedicated herself to helping the star, who suffered from alcoholism and insomnia. Her career slowed as a result, and she worked less for the remainder of the decade than she had done in the 1930s—notably by not appearing on-stage again until 1950. Her only appearance in 1943 was a cameo in the morale-building wartime film &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot;, playing herself. She took an atypical role in 1944, playing a Chinese peasant in the high-budget drama &quot;Dragon Seed&quot;. Hepburn was enthusiastic about the film, but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast. She then reunited with Tracy for the film version of &quot;Without Love&quot; (1945), after which she turned down a role in &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; to support Tracy through his return to Broadway. &quot;Without Love&quot; received poor reviews, but a new Tracy–Hepburn picture was a big event and it was popular on release, selling a record number of tickets over the Easter weekend in 1945.

Hepburn&#x27;s next film was &quot;Undercurrent&quot; (1946), a film noir with Robert Taylor and Robert Mitchum that was poorly received. A fourth film with Tracy came in 1947: a drama set in the American Old West entitled &quot;The Sea of Grass&quot;. Similarly to &quot;Keeper of the Flame&quot; and &quot;Without Love&quot;, a lukewarm response from critics did not stop it from being a financial success both at home and abroad. The same year, Hepburn portrayed Clara Wieck Schumann in &quot;Song of Love&quot;. She trained intensively with a pianist for the role. By the time of its release in October, Hepburn&#x27;s career had been significantly affected by her public opposition to the growing anti-communist movement in Hollywood. Viewed by some as dangerously progressive, she was not offered work for nine months and people reportedly threw things at screenings of &quot;Song of Love&quot;. Her next film role came unexpectedly, as she agreed to replace Claudette Colbert only days before shooting began on Frank Capra&#x27;s political drama &quot;State of the Union&quot; (1948). Tracy had long been signed to play the male lead, and so Hepburn was already familiar with the script and stepped up for the fifth Tracy–Hepburn picture. Critics responded positively to the film and it performed well at the box-office.

Tracy and Hepburn appeared onscreen together for a third consecutive year in the 1949 film &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot;. Like &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;, it was a &quot;battle of the sexes&quot; comedy and was written specifically for the duo by their friends Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon. A story of married lawyers who oppose each other in court, Hepburn described it as &quot;perfect for [Tracy] and me&quot;. Although her political views still prompted scattered picketing at theatres around the country, &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot; was a hit, favorably reviewed and the most profitable Tracy–Hepburn picture to date. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Bosley Crowther was full of praise for the film and hailed the duo&#x27;s &quot;perfect compatibility&quot;.

=== Professional expansion (1950–1952) ===
The 1950s saw Hepburn take on a series of professional challenges, and stretch herself further than at any other point in her life at an age when most other actresses began to retreat. Berg describes the decade as &quot;the heart of her vast legacy&quot; and &quot;the period in which she truly came into her own&quot;. In January 1950, Hepburn ventured into Shakespeare, playing Rosalind on stage in &quot;As You Like It&quot;. She hoped to prove that she could play already established material, and said, &quot;It&#x27;s better to try something difficult and flop than to play it safe all the time.&quot; It opened on Broadway at the Cort Theatre in New York to a capacity audience and was virtually sold out for 148 shows. The production then went on tour. Reviews for Hepburn varied, but she was noted as the only leading lady in Hollywood who was performing high-caliber material onstage.

In 1951, Hepburn filmed &quot;The African Queen&quot;, her first movie in Technicolor. She played Rose Sayer, a prim missionary living in German East Africa at the outbreak of World War I. Co-starring Humphrey Bogart, &quot;The African Queen&quot; was shot mostly on location in the Belgian Congo, an opportunity Hepburn embraced. It proved a difficult experience, however, and Hepburn became ill with dysentery during filming. Later in life, she released a memoir about the experience. The movie was released at the end of 1951 to popular support and critical acclaim, and gave Hepburn her fifth Best Actress nomination at the Academy Awards while garnering Bogart his only Academy Award for Best Actor. The first successful film she had made without Tracy since &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; a decade earlier, it proved that she could be a hit without him and fully reestablished her popularity.

Hepburn went on to make the sports comedy &quot;Pat and Mike&quot; (1952), the second film written specifically as a Tracy–Hepburn vehicle by Kanin and Gordon. She was a keen athlete, and Kanin later described this as his inspiration for the film: &quot;As I watched Kate playing tennis one day ... it occurred to me that her audience was missing a treat.&quot; Hepburn was under pressure to perform several sports to a high standard, many of which did not end up in the film. &quot;Pat and Mike&quot; was one of the team&#x27;s most popular and critically acclaimed films, and it was also Hepburn&#x27;s personal favorite of the nine films she made with Tracy. The performance brought her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.

In the summer of 1952, Hepburn appeared in London&#x27;s West End for a ten-week run of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;The Millionairess&quot;. Her parents had read Shaw to her when she was a child, which made the play a special experience for the actress. Two years of intense work had left her exhausted, however, and her friend Constance Collier wrote that Hepburn was &quot;on the verge of a nervous breakdown&quot;. Widely acclaimed, &quot;The Millionairess&quot; was taken to Broadway. In October 1952 it opened at the Shubert Theatre, where despite a lukewarm critical response it sold out its ten-week run. Hepburn subsequently tried to get the play adapted into a film: a script was written by Preston Sturges, and she offered to work for nothing and pay the director herself, but no studio picked up the project. She later referred to this as the biggest disappointment of her career.

=== Mid-career and Shakespeare (1953–1962) ===
&quot;Pat and Mike&quot; was the last film Hepburn completed on her MGM contract, making her free to select her own projects. She spent two years resting and traveling, before committing to David Lean&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Summertime&quot; (1955). The movie was filmed in Venice, with Hepburn playing an unmarried woman who has a passionate love affair. She described it as &quot;a very emotional part&quot; and found it fascinating to work with Lean. At her own insistence, Hepburn performed a fall into a canal and developed a chronic eye infection as a result. The role earned her another Academy Award nomination and has been cited as some of her finest work. Lean later said it was his personal favorite of the films he made, and Hepburn his favorite actress. The following year, Hepburn spent six months touring Australia with the Old Vic theatre company, playing Portia in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, Kate in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, and Isabella in &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;. The tour was successful and Hepburn earned significant plaudits for the effort.

Hepburn received an Academy Award nomination for the second year running for her work opposite Burt Lancaster in &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (1956). Again she played a lonely woman empowered by a love affair, and it became apparent that Hepburn had found a niche in playing mature, unmarried women. Hepburn said of playing such roles, &quot;With Lizzie Curry [&quot;The Rainmaker&quot;] and Jane Hudson [&quot;Summertime&quot;] and Rosie Sayer [&quot;The African Queen&quot;]—I was playing me. It wasn&#x27;t difficult for me to play those women, because I&#x27;m the maiden aunt.&quot; Less success that year came from &quot;The Iron Petticoat&quot; (1956), a reworking of the classic Greta Garbo comedy &quot;Ninotchka&quot;. Starring opposite Bob Hope, Hepburn played a cold-hearted Soviet pilot, in a performance Bosley Crowther called &quot;horrible&quot;. The film was a critical and commercial failure, and Hepburn considered it the worst movie of her career.

Tracy and Hepburn reunited on screen for the first time in five years for the office-based comedy &quot;Desk Set&quot; (1957). Berg notes that it worked as a hybrid of their earlier romantic-comedy successes, but it performed poorly at the box-office. That summer, Hepburn returned to Shakespeare. Appearing in Stratford, Connecticut, at the American Shakespeare Theatre, she repeated her Portia in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; and played Beatrice in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. The shows were positively received.

After two years away from the screen, Hepburn starred in a film adaptation of Tennessee Williams&#x27; controversial play &quot;Suddenly, Last Summer&quot; (1959) with Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift. The movie was shot in London and was &quot;a completely miserable experience&quot; for Hepburn. She clashed with director Joseph L. Mankiewicz during filming, which culminated with her spitting at him in disgust. The picture was a financial success, and her work as creepy aunt Violet Venable gave Hepburn her eighth Oscar nomination. Williams was pleased with the performance, writing, &quot;Kate is a playwright&#x27;s dream-actress. She makes dialogue sound better than it is by a matchless beauty and clarity of diction&quot;. He wrote &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1961) with Hepburn in mind, but the actress, although flattered, felt the play was wrong for her and declined the part, which went to Deborah Kerr.

Hepburn returned to Stratford in the summer of 1960 to play Viola in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, and Cleopatra in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. The &quot;New York Post&quot; wrote of her Cleopatra, &quot;Hepburn offers a highly versatile performance ... once or twice going in for her famous mannerisms and always being fascinating to watch.&quot; Hepburn herself was proud of the role. Her repertoire was further improved when she appeared in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s film version of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey Into Night&quot; (1962). It was a low-budget production, and she appeared in the film for a tenth of her established salary. She called it &quot;the greatest [play] this country has ever produced&quot; and the role of morphine-addicted Mary Tyrone &quot;the most challenging female role in American drama&quot;, and felt her performance was the best screen work of her career. &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey Into Night&quot; earned Hepburn an Oscar nomination and the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival. It remains one of her most praised performances.

=== Success in later years (1963–1970) ===
Following the completion of &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey Into Night&quot;, Hepburn took a break in her career to care for ailing Spencer Tracy. She did not work again until 1967&#x27;s &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot;, her ninth and final film with Tracy. The movie dealt with the subject of interracial marriage, with Hepburn&#x27;s niece, Katharine Houghton, playing her daughter. Tracy was dying by this point, suffering the effects of diabetes and heart disease, and Houghton later commented that her aunt was &quot;extremely tense&quot; during the production. Tracy died 17 days after filming his last scene. &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot; was a triumphant return for Hepburn and her most commercially successful picture to that point. She won her second Best Actress Award at the Oscars, 34 years after winning her first. Hepburn felt the award was not just for her but was also given to honor Tracy.

Hepburn quickly returned to acting after Tracy&#x27;s death, choosing to occupy herself as a remedy against grief. She received numerous scripts and chose to play Eleanor of Aquitaine in &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; (1968), a part she called &quot;fascinating&quot;. She read extensively in preparation for the role, in which she starred opposite Peter O&#x27;Toole. Filming took place in Montmajour Abbey in the south of France, an experience she loved despite being—according to director Anthony Harvey—&quot;enormously vulnerable&quot; throughout. John Russell Taylor of &quot;The Times&quot; suggested that Eleanor was &quot;the performance of her ... career&quot;, and proved that she was &quot;a growing, developing, still surprising actress&quot;. The movie was nominated in all the major categories at the 41st Academy Awards, and for the second year running Hepburn won the Oscar for Best Actress (shared with Barbra Streisand for &quot;Funny Girl&quot;). The role, combined with her performance in &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot;, also received a British Academy Film Award (BAFTA) for Best Actress. Hepburn&#x27;s next appearance was in &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot; (1969), which she filmed in Nice immediately after completing &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;. The picture was a failure critically and financially, and reviews targeted Hepburn for giving a misguided performance. By the end of 1969, she was voted the most popular female star in America by Quigley&#x27;s Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll, making a rare occurrence of an actress over 50 to achieve such a position.

From December 1969 to August 1970, Hepburn starred in the Broadway musical &quot;Coco&quot;, about the life of Coco Chanel. She admitted that before the show, she had never sat through a theatrical musical. She was not a strong singer, but found the offer irresistible and, as Berg puts it, &quot;what she lacked in euphony she made up for in guts&quot;. The actress took vocal lessons six times a week in preparation for the show. She was nervous about every performance and recalled &quot;wondering what the hell I was doing there&quot;. Reviews for the production were mediocre, but Hepburn herself was praised, and &quot;Coco&quot; was popular with the public—with its run twice extended. She later said &quot;Coco&quot; marked the first time she accepted that the public was not against her, but actually seemed to love her. Her work earned a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical.

=== Film, television, and theatre (1971–1983) ===

Hepburn stayed active throughout the 1970s, focusing on roles described by Andrew Britton as &quot;either a devouring mother or a batty old lady living [alone]&quot;. First she traveled to Spain to film a version of Euripides&#x27; &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; (1971) alongside Vanessa Redgrave. When asked why she had taken the role, she responded that she wanted to broaden her range and try everything while she still had time. The movie was poorly received, but the Kansas City Film Critics Circle named Hepburn&#x27;s performance the best from an actress that year. In 1971, she signed on to star in an adaptation of Graham Greene&#x27;s &quot;Travels with My Aunt&quot;, but was unhappy with early versions of the script and took to rewriting it herself. The studio disliked her changes, so Hepburn abandoned the project and was replaced with Maggie Smith. Her next film, an adaptation of Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot; (1973) directed by Tony Richardson, had a small release and received generally unfavorable reviews.

In 1973, Hepburn ventured into television for the first time, starring in a production of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;. She had been wary of the medium, but it proved to be one of the main television events of the year, scoring high in the Nielsen ratings. Hepburn received an Emmy Award nomination for playing wistful Southern mother Amanda Wingfield, which opened her mind to future work on the small screen. Her next project was the television movie &quot;Love Among the Ruins&quot; (1975), a London-based Edwardian drama with her friend Laurence Olivier. It received positive reviews and high ratings and earned Hepburn her only Emmy Award.

Hepburn made her only appearance at the Academy Awards in 1974, to present the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to Lawrence Weingarten. She received a standing ovation, and joked with the audience, &quot;I&#x27;m very happy I didn&#x27;t hear anyone call out, &#x27;It&#x27;s about time&#x27;.&quot; The following year, she was paired with John Wayne in the western &quot;Rooster Cogburn&quot;, a sequel to his Oscar-winning film &quot;True Grit&quot;. Echoing her &quot;African Queen&quot; character, Hepburn played a deeply religious unmarried woman who teams up with a masculine loner to avenge a family member&#x27;s death. The movie received mediocre reviews. Its casting was enough to draw some people to the box office, but it did not meet studio expectations and was only moderately successful.

In 1976, Hepburn returned to Broadway for a three-month run of Enid Bagnold&#x27;s play &quot;A Matter of Gravity&quot;. The role of eccentric Mrs. Basil was deemed a perfect showcase for the actress, and the play was popular despite poor reviews. It later went on a successful nationwide tour. During its Los Angeles run, Hepburn fractured her hip, but she chose to continue the tour performing in a wheelchair. That year, she was voted &quot;Favorite Motion Picture Actress&quot; by the People&#x27;s Choice Awards.

During the summer of 1976, Hepburn starred in the low-budget family film &quot;Olly Olly Oxen Free&quot;. The feature failed to find a major-studio distributor and was finally released independently in 1978. Because of its poor distribution, it played in relatively few theaters, resulting in one of the biggest misfires of Hepburn&#x27;s career. The screenwriter James Prideaux, who worked with Hepburn, later wrote that it &quot;died at the moment of release&quot; and referred to it as her &quot;lost film&quot;. Hepburn claimed the main reason she had done it was the opportunity to ride in a hot-air balloon. The television movie &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot; (1979), which was filmed in Wales, followed. It was the last of ten films Hepburn made with George Cukor, and gained her a third Emmy nomination.

By the 1980s, Hepburn had developed a noticeable tremor, giving her a permanently shaking head. She did not work for two years, saying in a television interview, &quot;I&#x27;ve had my day—let the kids scramble and sweat it out.&quot; During this period she saw the Broadway production &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;, and was impressed by its depiction of an elderly married couple coping with the difficulties of old age. Jane Fonda had purchased the screen rights for her father, actor Henry Fonda, and Hepburn sought to play opposite him in the role of quirky Ethel Thayer. &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; was a success, the second-highest-grossing film of 1981. It demonstrated how energetic the 74-year-old Hepburn was, as she dived fully clothed into Squam Lake and gave a lively singing performance. The film won her a second BAFTA and a record fourth Academy Award. Homer Dickens, in his book on Hepburn, notes that it was widely considered a sentimental win, &quot;a tribute to her enduring career&quot;.

Hepburn also returned to the stage in 1981. She received a second Tony nomination for her portrayal in &quot;The West Side Waltz&quot; of a septuagenarian widow with a zest for life. &quot;Variety&quot; observed that the role was &quot;an obvious and entirely acceptable version of [Hepburn&#x27;s] own public image&quot;. Walter Kerr of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of Hepburn and her performance, &quot;One mysterious thing she has learned to do is breathe unchallengeable life into lifeless lines.&quot; She hoped to make a film out of the production, but nobody purchased the rights. Hepburn&#x27;s reputation as one of America&#x27;s best loved actors was firmly established by this point, as she was named favorite movie actress in a survey by &quot;People&quot; magazine and again won the popularity award from People&#x27;s Choice.

=== Focus on television (1984–1994) ===
In 1984, Hepburn starred in the dark-comedy &quot;Grace Quigley&quot;, the story of an elderly woman who enlists a hitman (Nick Nolte) to kill her. Hepburn found humor in the morbid theme, but reviews were negative and the box-office was poor. In 1985, she presented a television documentary about the life and career of Spencer Tracy. The majority of Hepburn&#x27;s roles from this point were in television movies, which did not receive the critical praise of her earlier work in the medium, but remained popular with audiences. With each release, Hepburn would declare it her final screen appearance, but she continued to take on new roles. She received an Emmy nomination for 1986&#x27;s &quot;Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry&quot;, then two years later returned for the comedy &quot;Laura Lansing Slept Here&quot;, which allowed her to act with her grandniece, Schuyler Grant.

In 1991, Hepburn released her autobiography, &quot;Me: Stories of My Life&quot;, which topped best-seller lists for over a year. She returned to television screens in 1992 for &quot;The Man Upstairs&quot;, co-starring Ryan O&#x27;Neal, for which she received a Golden Globe nomination. In 1994, she worked opposite Anthony Quinn in &quot;This Can&#x27;t Be Love&quot;, which was largely based on Hepburn&#x27;s own life, with numerous references to her personality and career. These later roles have been described as &quot;a fictional version of the typically feisty Kate Hepburn character&quot; and critics have remarked that Hepburn was essentially playing herself.

Hepburn&#x27;s final appearance in a theatrically released film, and her first since &quot;Grace Quigley&quot; nine years earlier, was &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1994). At 87 years old, she played a supporting role, alongside Annette Bening and Warren Beatty. It was the only film of Hepburn&#x27;s career, other than the cameo appearance in &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot;, in which she did not play a leading role. Roger Ebert noted that it was the first time she had looked frail, but that the &quot;magnificent spirit&quot; was still there, and said her scenes &quot;steal the show&quot;. A writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; reflected on the actress&#x27;s final big-screen appearance: &quot;If she moved more slowly than before, in demeanor, she was as game and modern as she had ever been.&quot; Hepburn played her final role in the television film &quot;One Christmas&quot; (1994), for which she received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination at 87 years old.

== Personal life ==

=== Beliefs ===
In 1991, Hepburn told &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m an atheist, and that&#x27;s it. I believe there&#x27;s nothing we can know except that we should be kind to each other and do what we can for each other.&quot; Hepburn also aligned herself with liberalism.

=== Public image and character ===

Hepburn was known for being fiercely private, and would not give interviews or talk to fans for much of her career. She distanced herself from the celebrity life and was not interested in a social scene she saw as tedious and superficial. She wore casual clothes that went strongly against convention in an era of glamour. She rarely appeared in public, usually avoided restaurants and once wrestled a camera out of a photographer&#x27;s hand when he took her picture without asking. Despite her zeal for privacy, she enjoyed her fame and later confessed that she would not have liked the press to ignore her. The protective attitude toward her private life diminished as she aged; beginning with a two-hour-long interview on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; in 1973, Hepburn became much more open with the public.

Hepburn&#x27;s relentless energy and enthusiasm for life are often cited in biographies and her headstrong independence became key to her celebrity status. This self-assurance came with a tendency to be controlling and difficult; her friend Garson Kanin likened her to a schoolmistress and she was famously blunt and outspoken. Katharine Houghton commented that her aunt could be &quot;maddeningly self-righteous and bossy&quot;. Hepburn confessed to being, especially early in life, &quot;a &quot;me me me&quot; person&quot;. She saw herself as having a happy nature, reasoning &quot;I like life and I&#x27;ve been so lucky, why shouldn&#x27;t I be happy?&quot; A. Scott Berg knew Hepburn well in her later years and said that while she was demanding, she retained a sense of humility and humanity.

The actress led an active life, reportedly swimming and playing tennis every morning. In her eighties she was still playing tennis regularly, as indicated in her 1993 documentary &quot;All About Me&quot;. She also enjoyed painting, which became a passion later in life. Asked about politics, Hepburn told an interviewer, &quot;I always just say be on the affirmative and liberal side. Don&#x27;t be a &#x27;no&#x27; person&quot;. The anti-Communist attitude in 1940s Hollywood prompted her to political activity, as she joined the Committee for the First Amendment. Her name was mentioned at the hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee but Hepburn denied being a Communist sympathizer. Later in life, she openly promoted birth control and supported the legal right to abortion. She described herself as a &quot;dedicated Democrat&quot;. She practiced Albert Schweitzer&#x27;s theory of &quot;Reverence for Life&quot; but did not believe in religion or the afterlife. In 1991, Hepburn told a journalist, &quot;I&#x27;m an atheist, and that&#x27;s it. I believe there&#x27;s nothing we can know, except that we should be kind to each other and do what we can for other people&quot;. Her public declarations of these beliefs led the American Humanist Association to award her the Humanist Arts Award in 1985.

Hepburn liked to go barefoot and for her first acting role, in the play &quot;The Woman in the Moon&quot;, she insisted that her character Pandora should not wear shoes. Offscreen, she usually dressed in slacks and sandals, even for formal occasions, such as television interviews. She said, &quot;the thing that drove me out of skirts was the stocking situation ... That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve always worn pants ... that way you can always go barefoot&quot;.

=== Relationships ===

Hepburn&#x27;s only marriage was to Ludlow Ogden Smith, a socialite-businessman from Philadelphia whom she met while a student at Bryn Mawr. The couple wed on December 12, 1928, when she was 21 and he was 29. Smith changed his name to S. Ogden Ludlow at her behest so that she would not be &quot;Kate Smith&quot;, which she considered too plain. She never fully committed to the marriage and prioritized her career. The move to Hollywood in 1932 cemented the couple&#x27;s estrangement. Hepburn filed for divorce in Yucatán on April 30, 1934, and it was finalized on May 8. Hepburn often expressed her gratitude toward Smith for his financial and moral support in the early days of her career, and in her autobiography she called herself &quot;a terrible pig&quot; for exploiting his love. The pair remained friends until his death in 1979.

Soon after moving to California, Hepburn began a relationship with her agent, Leland Hayward, although they were both married. Hayward proposed to the actress after they had both divorced, but she declined, later explaining, &quot;I liked the idea of being my own single self.&quot; The affair lasted four years. In 1936, while she was touring &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; Hepburn began a relationship with entrepreneur Howard Hughes. She had been introduced to him a year earlier by their mutual friend Cary Grant. Hughes wished to marry her, and the tabloids reported their impending nuptials, but Hepburn stayed focused on resurrecting her failing career. They separated in 1938, when Hepburn left Hollywood after being labeled &quot;box office poison&quot;.

Hepburn stuck to her decision not to remarry and made a conscious choice not to have children. She believed that motherhood required a full-time commitment, and said it was not one she was willing to make. &quot;I would have been a terrible mother,&quot; she told Berg, &quot;because I&#x27;m basically a very selfish human being.&quot; She felt she had partially experienced parenthood through her much younger siblings, which fulfilled any need to have children of her own.

Rumors have existed since the 1930s that Hepburn was a lesbian or bisexual, which she often joked about. In 2007, William J. Mann released a biography of the actress in which he argued this was the case. In response to this speculation, her niece, Katharine Houghton said, &quot;I&#x27;ve never discovered any evidence whatsoever that she was a lesbian.&quot; However, in a 2017 documentary, columnist Liz Smith, who was a close friend, attested that she was.

==== Spencer Tracy ====

The most significant relationship of Hepburn&#x27;s life was with Spencer Tracy, her co-star in nine films. In her autobiography, she wrote, &quot;It was a unique feeling that I had for [Tracy]. I would have done anything for him.&quot; Lauren Bacall, a close friend, later wrote of how &quot;blindingly&quot; in love Hepburn was with the actor. The relationship has subsequently been publicized as one of Hollywood&#x27;s legendary love affairs.

Hepburn and Tracy met at MGM in 1941, when they were to begin filming &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;, when she was 34 and he was 41. Tracy was initially wary of Hepburn, unimpressed by her dirty fingernails and suspecting that she was a lesbian, but Hepburn said she &quot;knew right away that [she] found him irresistible&quot;. Tracy remained married throughout their relationship. Although he and his wife, Louise, had been living separate lives since the 1930s, there was never an official split and neither party pursued a divorce. Hepburn did not interfere.

With Tracy determined to conceal the relationship with Hepburn from his wife, it had to remain private. They were careful not to be seen in public together and maintained separate residences. Tracy suffered from a severe alcohol addiction and was extremely moody and frequently depressed; Hepburn described him as &quot;tortured&quot;, and she devoted herself to making his life easier. Reports from people who saw them together describe how Hepburn&#x27;s entire demeanor changed when around Tracy. She reportedly mothered and obeyed him, and he soon became dependent on her. They often spent significant stretches of time apart due to their work, especially in the 1950s when Hepburn frequently traveled abroad for film commitments.

Tracy&#x27;s alcoholism took an immense toll on his health and in the early 1960s, Hepburn took a five-year break in her career to care for him. She moved into Tracy&#x27;s house for this period and was with him when he died on June 10, 1967. Out of consideration for Tracy&#x27;s family, she did not attend his funeral. It was only after Louise Tracy&#x27;s death in 1983, that Hepburn began to speak publicly about her feelings for Tracy, though their relationship had been an open secret for many years. In response to the question of why she stayed with Tracy for so long, despite the nature of their relationship, she said, &quot;I honestly don&#x27;t know. I can only say that I could never have left him.&quot; She claimed to not know how he felt about her, and that they &quot;just passed twenty-seven years together in what was to me absolute bliss&quot;.

=== Final years and death ===

Hepburn stated in her eighties, &quot;I have no fear of death. Must be wonderful, like a long sleep.&quot; Her health began to deteriorate not long after her final screen appearance, and she was hospitalized in March 1993 for exhaustion. In the winter of 1996, she was hospitalized with pneumonia. By 1997, she had become very weak and was speaking and eating very little, and it was feared she would die. She showed signs of dementia in her final years. By 2000, she was regarded by her niece to be a &quot;private person&quot;. In July 2001, she was admitted to a hospital for pneumonia and a urinary tract infection. In May 2003, an aggressive tumor was found in Hepburn&#x27;s neck. The decision was made not to medically intervene, and she died from cardiac arrest on June 29, 2003, at the Hepburn family home in Fenwick, Connecticut. She was buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford. Hepburn requested there be no memorial service.

Hepburn&#x27;s death received considerable public attention. Many tributes were held on television, and newspapers and magazines dedicated issues to the actress. American president George W. Bush said Hepburn &quot;will be remembered as one of the nation&#x27;s artistic treasures&quot;. In honor of her extensive theatre work, the lights of Broadway were dimmed for the evening of July 1, 2003.

In 2004, in accordance with Hepburn&#x27;s wishes, her belongings were put up for auction with Sotheby&#x27;s in New York City. The event garnered $5.8 million, which Hepburn willed to her family.

== Acting style and screen persona ==


According to reports, Hepburn was not an instinctive actor. She liked to study the text and character carefully beforehand, making sure she knew them thoroughly, and then to rehearse as much as possible and film multiple takes of a scene. With a genuine passion for acting she committed heavily to each role and insisted on learning any necessary skills and performing stunts herself. She was known to learn not only her own lines but also those of her co-stars. Commenting on her motivation, Stanley Kramer said, &quot;Work, work, work. She can work till everyone drops.&quot; Hepburn involved herself in the production of each of her films, making suggestions for the script and stating her opinion on everything from costumes to lighting to camerawork.

The characters Hepburn played were, with very few exceptions, wealthy and intelligent, and often strong and independent. These tough characters tended to be humbled in some form and revealed to have a hidden vulnerability. Garson Kanin described what he called &quot;the formula for a Hepburn success: A high-class, or stuck-up ... girl is brought down to earth by an earthy type, or a lowbrow ... or a cataclysmic situation. It seems to have worked time and time again.&quot; Due to this repeated character arc, Hepburn embodied the &quot;contradictions&quot; of the &quot;nature and status of women&quot;, and the strong females she depicts are eventually &quot;restored to a safe position within the status quo&quot;. Film critic Molly Haskell has commented on the importance of this to Hepburn&#x27;s career: With an intimidating presence, it was necessary that her characters &quot;do some kind of self-abasement, to stay on the good side of the audience&quot;.

Hepburn is one of the most celebrated American actresses, but she has also been criticized for a lack of versatility. Her on-screen persona closely matched her own real personality, something Hepburn admitted herself. In 1991 she told a journalist, &quot;I think I&#x27;m always the same. I had a very definite personality, and I liked material that showed that personality.&quot; Playwright and author David Macaray has said, &quot;Picture Katharine Hepburn in every movie she ever starred in, and ask yourself if she&#x27;s not playing, essentially, the same part over and over ... Icon or no icon, let&#x27;s not confuse a truly fascinating and unique woman with a superior actress.&quot; Another repeated criticism is that her demeanor was too cold.

== Legacy ==
Hepburn is considered an important and influential cultural figure. Ros Horton and Sally Simmons included her in their book &quot;Women Who Changed The World&quot;, which honors 50 women who helped shape world history and culture. She is also named in &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; list of &quot;300 Women Who Changed the World&quot;, &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot;&#x27;s book &quot;100 Most Important Women of the 20th century&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Icons of the Century&quot;, and she is number 84 on VH1&#x27;s list of the &quot;200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons of All Time&quot;. In 1999, the American Film Institute named Hepburn the &quot;greatest American screen legend&quot; among females.

Regarding Hepburn&#x27;s film legacy, one of her biographers, Sheridan Morley, said she &quot;broke the mould&quot; for women in Hollywood, where she brought a new breed of strong-willed females to the screen. Film academic Andrew Britton wrote a monograph studying Hepburn&#x27;s &quot;key presence within classical Hollywood, a consistent, potentially radical disturbance&quot;, and pinpoints her &quot;central&quot; influence in bringing feminist issues to the screen.

Off screen, Hepburn&#x27;s lifestyle was ahead of her time, coming to symbolize the &quot;modern woman&quot; and playing a part in changing gender attitudes. Horton and Simmons write, &quot;Confident, intelligent and witty, four-time Oscar winner Katharine Hepburn defied convention throughout her professional and personal life ... Hepburn provided an image of an assertive woman whom [females] could watch and learn from.&quot; After Hepburn&#x27;s death, film historian Jeanine Basinger stated, &quot;What she brought us was a new kind of heroine—modern and independent. She was beautiful, but she did not rely on that.&quot; Mary McNamara, an entertainment journalist and reviewer for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;More than a movie star, Katharine Hepburn was the patron saint of the independent American female.&quot; She was not universally revered by feminists, however, who were angered by her public declarations that women &quot;cannot have it all&quot;, meaning a family and a career.

Hepburn&#x27;s legacy extends to fashion, where she pioneered wearing trousers at a time when it was a radical move for a woman. She helped make trousers acceptable for women, and fans began to imitate her clothing. In 1986 she received a lifetime achievement award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America in recognition of her influence on women&#x27;s fashion.

A number of Hepburn&#x27;s films have become classics of American cinema, with four of her pictures (&quot;The African Queen&quot;, &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;, &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;, and &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot;) featured on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest American Films of all time. &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot; and &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; were included in the AFI&#x27;s list of the Greatest American Comedies. She is considered one of the most distinctive voices in film history with her clipped vocal style and patrician accent.

=== Memorials ===
Hepburn has been honored with several memorials. The Turtle Bay community in New York City, where she maintained a residence for over 60 years, dedicated a garden in her name located in Dag Hammarskjöld Plaza in 1997. After Hepburn&#x27;s death in 2003, the intersection of East 49th Street and 2nd Avenue was renamed &quot;Katharine Hepburn Place&quot;. Three years later Bryn Mawr College, Hepburn&#x27;s alma mater, launched the Katharine Houghton Hepburn Center. It is dedicated to both the actress and her mother and encourages women to address important issues affecting their gender. The center awards the annual Katharine Hepburn Medal, which &quot;recognizes women whose lives, work and contributions embody the intelligence, drive and independence of the four-time-Oscar-winning actress&quot; and whose award recipients &quot;are chosen on the basis of their commitment and contributions to the Hepburn women&#x27;s greatest passions—civic engagement and the arts&quot;. The Katharine Hepburn Cultural Arts Center was opened in 2009 in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, the location of the Hepburn family beach home, which she loved and later owned. The building includes a performance space and a Katharine Hepburn Museum that features personal letters, film memorabilia, costumes, and many personal effects.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences library and the New York Public Library hold collections of Hepburn&#x27;s personal papers. Selections from the New York collection, which documents Hepburn&#x27;s theatrical career, were presented in a five-month exhibition, &quot;Katharine Hepburn: In Her Own Files&quot;, in 2009. Other exhibitions have been held to showcase Hepburn&#x27;s career. &quot;One Life: Kate, A Centennial Celebration&quot; was held at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington from November 2007 to September 2008. Kent State University exhibited a selection of her film and theatre costumes from October 2010 to September 2011 in &quot;Katharine Hepburn: Dressed for Stage and Screen&quot;. Hepburn has also been honored with her own postal stamp as part of the &quot;Legends of Hollywood&quot; stamp series. In 2015, the British Film Institute held a two-month retrospective of Hepburn&#x27;s work.

=== Characterizations ===
Hepburn is the subject of a one-woman play, &quot;Tea at Five&quot;, written by Matthew Lombardo. The first act features Hepburn in 1938, after being labeled &quot;box office poison&quot;, and the second act in 1983, where she reflects on her life and career. It premiered in 2002 at the Hartford Stage. Hepburn has been portrayed in &quot;Tea at Five&quot; by Kate Mulgrew, Tovah Feldshuh, Stephanie Zimbalist, and Charles Busch. A revised version of the play, eliminating the first act and expanding the second, premiered on June 28, 2019, at Boston&#x27;s Huntington Theater with Faye Dunaway playing Hepburn. Feldshuh also appeared as Hepburn in &quot;The Amazing Howard Hughes&quot;, a 1977 television movie, while Mearle Ann Taylor later portrayed her in &quot;The Scarlett O&#x27;Hara War&quot; (1980). In Martin Scorsese&#x27;s Howard Hughes biographical film &quot;The Aviator&quot;, Hepburn was portrayed by Cate Blanchett, which earned her the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. This marked the first instance where the portrayal of an Academy Award-winning actress itself won an Academy Award.

==Acting credits==
During her 66-year career, Hepburn appeared in 44 feature films, 8 television movies, and 33 plays. Her movie career covered a range of genres, including screwball comedies, period dramas, and adaptations of works by top American playwrights. She appeared on the stage in every decade from the 1920s to the 1980s, performing plays by Shakespeare and Shaw, and a Broadway musical.

<doc id="43339" wikidata="Q193446" url="?curid=43339" title="Packet switching">
<text>In telecommunications, packet switching is a method of grouping data into short messages in fixed format, i.e. &quot;packets,&quot; that are transmitted over a digital network. Packets are made of a header and a payload. Data in the header is used by networking hardware to direct the packet to its destination, where the payload is extracted and used by an operating system, application software, or higher layer protocols. Packet switching is the primary basis for data communications in computer networks worldwide.

During the early 1960s, American engineer Paul Baran developed a concept he called &quot;distributed adaptive message block switching&quot;, with the goal of providing a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunication messages as part of a research program at the RAND Corporation, funded by the United States Department of Defense. His ideas contradicted then-established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth, exemplified by the development of telecommunications in the Bell System. The new concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of Welsh computer scientist Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory in 1965. Davies coined the modern term &quot;packet switching&quot; and inspired numerous packet switching networks in the decade following, including the incorporation of the concept into the design of the ARPANET in the United States and the CYCLADES network in France. The ARPANET and CYCLADES were the primary precursor networks of the modern Internet.

==Concept==
A simple definition of packet switching is:
Packet switching allows delivery of variable bit rate data streams, realized as sequences of short messages in fixed format, i.e. &quot;packets&quot;, over a computer network which allocates transmission resources as needed using statistical multiplexing or dynamic bandwidth allocation techniques. As they traverse networking hardware, such as switches and routers, packets are received, buffered, queued, and retransmitted (stored and forwarded), resulting in variable latency and throughput depending on the link capacity and the traffic load on the network. Packets are normally forwarded by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in, first-out buffering, but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing, traffic shaping, or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service, such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket. Packet-based communication may be implemented with or without intermediate forwarding nodes (switches and routers). In case of a shared physical medium (such as radio or 10BASE5), the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme.

Packet switching contrasts with another principal networking paradigm, circuit switching, a method which pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session, each having a constant bit rate and latency between nodes. In cases of billable services, such as cellular communication services, circuit switching is characterized by a fee per unit of connection time, even when no data is transferred, while packet switching may be characterized by a fee per unit of information transmitted, such as characters, packets, or messages.

A packet switch has four components: input ports, output ports, routing processor, and switching fabric.

==History==

=== Invention and development ===

The concept of switching small blocks of data was first explored independently by Paul Baran at the RAND Corporation during the early 1960s in the US and Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in the UK in 1965.

In the late 1950s, the US Air Force established a wide area network for the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) radar defense system. Recognizing vulnerabilities in this network, the Air Force sought a system that might survive a nuclear attack to enable a response, thus diminishing the attractiveness of the first strike advantage by enemies (see Mutual assured destruction). In the early 1960s, Baran invented the concept of &quot;distributed adaptive message block switching&quot; in support of the Air Force initiative. The concept was first presented to the Air Force in the summer of 1961 as briefing B-265, later published as RAND report P-2626 in 1962, and finally in report RM 3420 in 1964. The reports describe a general architecture for a large-scale, distributed, survivable communications network. The proposal was composed of three key ideas: use of a decentralized network with multiple paths between any two points; dividing user messages into &quot;message blocks;&quot; and delivery of these messages by store and forward switching. Baran&#x27;s network design was focused on digital communication of voice messages using switches that were low-cost electronics.

Christopher Strachey, who became Oxford University&#x27;s first Professor of Computation, filed a patent application in the United Kingdom for time-sharing in February 1959. In June that year, he gave a paper &quot;Time Sharing in Large Fast Computers&quot; at the UNESCO Information Processing Conference in Paris where he passed the concept on to J. C. R. Licklider. Licklider (along with John McCarthy) was instrumental in the development of time-sharing. After conversations with Licklider about time-sharing with remote computers in 1965, Davies independently invented a similar data communication concept, using short messages in fixed format with high data transmission rates to achieve rapid communications. He went on to develop a more advanced design for a hierarchical, high-speed computer network including interface computers and communication protocols. He coined the term &quot;packet switching&quot;, and proposed building a commercial nationwide data network in the UK. He gave a talk on the proposal in 1966, after which a person from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) told him about Baran&#x27;s work. 

Roger Scantlebury, a member of Davies&#x27; team, presented their work (and referenced that of Baran) at the October 1967 Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP). At the conference, Scantlebury proposed packet switching for use in the ARPANET and persuaded Larry Roberts the economics were favorable to message switching. Davies had chosen some of the same parameters for his original network design as did Baran, such as a packet size of 1024 bits. To deal with packet permutations (due to dynamically updated route preferences) and datagram losses (unavoidable when fast sources send to a slow destinations), he assumed that &quot;all users of the network will provide themselves with some kind of error control&quot;, thus inventing what came to be known as the end-to-end principle. Davies proposed that a local-area network should be built at the laboratory to serve the needs of NPL and prove the feasibility of packet switching. After a pilot experiment in early 1969, the NPL Data Communications Network began service in 1970. Davies was invited to Japan to give a series of lectures on packet switching. The NPL team carried out simulation work on datagrams and congestion in networks on a scale to provide data communication across the United Kingdom.

Larry Roberts made the key decisions in the request for proposal to build the ARPANET. Roberts met Baran in February 1967, but did not discuss networks. He asked Frank Westervelt to explore the questions of message size and contents for the network, and to write a position paper on the intercomputer communication protocol including “conventions for character and block transmission, error checking and re transmission, and computer and user identification.&quot; Roberts revised his initial design, which was to connect the host computers directly, to incorporate Wesley Clark&#x27;s idea to use Interface Message Processors (IMPs) to create a message switching network, which he presented at SOSP. Roberts was known for making decisions quickly. Immediately after SOSP, he incorporated Davies&#x27; and Baran&#x27;s concepts and designs for packet switching to enable the data communications on the network.

A contemporary of Roberts&#x27; from MIT, Leonard Kleinrock had researched the application of queueing theory in the field of message switching for his doctoral dissertation in 1961–62 and published it as a book in 1964. Davies, in his 1966 paper on packet switching, applied Kleinorck&#x27;s techniques to show that &quot;there is an ample margin between the estimated performance of the [packet-switched] system and the stated requirement&quot; in terms of a satisfactory response time for a human user. This addressed a key question about the viability of computer networking. Larry Roberts brought Kleinrock into the ARPANET project informally in early 1967. Roberts and Taylor recognized the issue of response time was important, but did not apply Kleinrock&#x27;s methods to assess this and based their design on a store-and-forward system that was not intended for real-time computing. After SOSP, and after Roberts&#x27; direction to use packet switching, Kleinrock sought input from Baran and proposed to retain Baran and RAND as advisors. The ARPANET working group assigned Kleinrock responsibility to prepare a report on software for the IMP. In 1968, Roberts awarded Kleinrock a contract to establish a Network Measurement Center (NMC) at UCLA to measure and model the performance of packet switching in the ARPANET. 

Bolt Beranek &amp; Newman (BBN) won the contract to build the network. Designed principally by Bob Kahn, it was the first wide-area packet-switched network with distributed control. The BBN &quot;IMP Guys&quot; independently developed significant aspects of the network&#x27;s internal operation, including the routing algorithm, flow control, software design, and network control. The UCLA NMC and the BBN team also investigated network congestion. The Network Working Group, led by Steve Crocker, a graduate student of Kleinrock&#x27;s at UCLA, developed the host-to-host protocol, the Network Control Program, which was approved by Barry Wessler for ARPA, after he ordered certain more exotic elements to be dropped. In 1970, Kleinrock extended his earlier analytic work on message switching to packet switching in the ARPANET. His work influenced the development of the ARPANET and packet-switched networks generally. 

The ARPANET was demonstrated at the International Conference on Computer Communication (ICCC) in Washington in October 1972. However, fundamental questions about the design of packet-switched networks remained.

Roberts presented the idea of packet switching to communication industry professionals in the early 1970s. Before ARPANET was operating, they argued that the router buffers would quickly run out. After the ARPANET was operating, they argued packet switching would never be economic without the government subsidy. Baran had faced the same rejection and thus failed to convince the military into constructing a packet switching network in the 1960s.

The CYCLADES network was designed by Louis Pouzin in the early 1970s to study internetworking. It was the first to implement the end-to-end principle of Davies, and make the host computers responsible for the reliable delivery of data on a packet-switched network, rather than this being a service of the network itself. His team was thus first to tackle the highly-complex problem of providing user applications with a reliable virtual circuit service while using a best-effort service, an early contribution to what will be the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

Bob Metcalfe and others at Xerox PARC outlined the idea of Ethernet and the PARC Universal Packet (PUP) for internetworking.

In May 1974, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn described the Transmission Control Program, an internetworking protocol for sharing resources using packet-switching among the nodes. The specifications of the TCP were then published in (&quot;Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program&quot;), written by Vint Cerf, Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine in December 1974. 

The X.25 protocol, developed by Rémi Després and others, was built on the concept of virtual circuits. In the mid-late 1970s and early 1980s, national and international public data networks emerged using X.25 which was developed with participation from France, the UK, Japan, USA and Canada. It was complemented with X.75 to enable internetworking. 

Packet switching was shown to be optimal in the Huffman coding sense in 1978. 

In the late 1970s, the monolithic Transmission Control Program was layered as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), atop the Internet Protocol (IP). Many Internet pioneers developed this into the Internet protocol suite and the associated Internet architecture and governance that emerged in the 1980s.

For a period in the 1980s and early 1990s, the network engineering community was polarized over the implementation of competing protocol suites, commonly known as the Protocol Wars. It was unclear which of the Internet protocol suite and the OSI model would result in the best and most robust computer networks.

Leonard Kleinrock&#x27;s research work during the 1970s addressed packet switching networks, packet radio networks, local area networks, broadband networks, nomadic computing, peer-to-peer networks, and intelligent software agents. His theoretical work on hierarchical routing with student Farouk Kamoun became critical to the operation of the Internet. Kleinrock published hundreds of research papers, which ultimately launched a new field of research on the theory and application of queuing theory to computer networks.

Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) VLSI (very-large-scale integration) technology led to the development of high-speed broadband packet switching during the 1980s1990s.

=== The &quot;paternity dispute&quot; ===

Roberts claimed in later years that, by the time of the October 1967 SOSP, he already had the concept of packet switching in mind (although not yet named and not written down in his paper published at the conference, which a number of sources describe as &quot;vague&quot;), and that this originated with his old colleague, Kleinrock, who had written about such concepts in his Ph.D. research in 1961-2. In 1997, along with seven other Internet pioneers, Roberts and Kleinrock co-wrote &quot;Brief History of the Internet&quot; published by the Internet Society. In it, Kleinrock is described as having &quot;published the first paper on packet switching theory in July 1961 and the first book on the subject in 1964&quot;. Many sources about the history of the Internet began to reflect these claims as uncontroversial facts. This became the subject of what Katie Hafner called a &quot;paternity dispute&quot; in The New York Times in 2001.

The disagreement about Kleinrock&#x27;s contribution to packet switching dates back to a version of the above claim made on Kleinrock&#x27;s profile on the UCLA Computer Science department website sometime in the 1990s. Here, he was referred to as the &quot;Inventor of the Internet Technology&quot;. The webpage&#x27;s depictions of Kleinrock&#x27;s achievements provoked anger among some early Internet pioneers. The dispute over priority became a public issue after Donald Davies posthumously published a paper in 2001 in which he denied that Kleinrock&#x27;s work was related to packet switching. Davies also described ARPANET project manager Larry Roberts as supporting Kleinrock, referring to Roberts&#x27; writings online and Kleinrock&#x27;s UCLA webpage profile as &quot;very misleading&quot;. Walter Isaacson wrote that Kleinrock&#x27;s claims &quot;led to an outcry among many of the other Internet pioneers, who publicly attacked Kleinrock and said that his brief mention of breaking messages into smaller pieces did not come close to being a proposal for packet switching&quot;. 

Davies&#x27; paper reignited a previous dispute over who deserves credit for getting the ARPANET online between engineers at Bolt, Beranek, and Newman (BBN) who had been involved in building and designing the ARPANET IMP on the one side, and ARPA-related researchers on the other. This earlier dispute is exemplified by BBN&#x27;s Will Crowther, who in a 1990 oral history described Paul Baran&#x27;s packet switching design (which he called hot-potato routing), as &quot;crazy&quot; and non-sensical, despite the ARPA team having advocated for it. The reignited debate caused other former BBN employees to make their concerns known, including Alex McKenzie, who followed Davies in disputing that Kleinrock&#x27;s work was related to packet switching, stating &quot;... there is nothing in the entire 1964 book that suggests, analyzes, or alludes to the idea of packetization&quot;.

Former IPTO director Bob Taylor also joined the debate, stating that &quot;authors who have interviewed dozens of Arpanet pioneers know very well that the Kleinrock-Roberts claims are not believed&quot;. Walter Isaacson notes that &quot;until the mid-1990s Kleinrock had credited [Baran and Davies] with coming up with the idea of packet switching&quot;.

A subsequent version of Kleinrock&#x27;s biography webpage was copyrighted in 2009 by Kleinrock. He was called on to defend his position over subsequent decades. In 2023, he acknowledged that his published work in the early 1960s was about message switching and claimed he was thinking about packet switching. Primary sources and historians recognize Baran and Davies for independently inventing the concept of digital packet switching used in modern computer networking including the ARPANET and the Internet.

Kleinrock has received many awards for his ground-breaking applied mathematical research on packet switching, carried out in the 1970s, which was an extension of his pioneering work in the early 1960s on the optimization of message delays in communication networks. However, Kleinrock&#x27;s claims that his work in the early 1960s originated the concept of packet switching and that his work was a source of the packet switching concepts used in the ARPANET have affected sources on the topic, which has created methodological challenges in the historiography of the Internet. Historian Andrew L. Russell said &quot;&#x27;Internet history&#x27; also suffers from a third, methodological, problem: it tends to be too close to its sources. Many Internet pioneers are alive, active, and eager to shape the histories that describe their accomplishments. Many museums and historians are equally eager to interview the pioneers and to publicize their stories&quot;.

==Connectionless and connection-oriented modes==
Packet switching may be classified into connectionless packet switching, also known as datagram switching, and connection-oriented packet switching, also known as virtual circuit switching. Examples of connectionless systems are Ethernet, IP, and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Connection-oriented systems include X.25, Frame Relay, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), and TCP.

In connectionless mode each packet is labeled with a destination address, source address, and port numbers. It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet. This information eliminates the need for a pre-established path to help the packet find its way to its destination, but means that more information is needed in the packet header, which is therefore larger. The packets are routed individually, sometimes taking different paths resulting in out-of-order delivery. At the destination, the original message may be reassembled in the correct order, based on the packet sequence numbers. Thus a virtual circuit carrying a byte stream is provided to the application by a transport layer protocol, although the network only provides a connectionless network layer service.

Connection-oriented transmission requires a setup phase to establish the parameters of communication before any packet is transferred. The signaling protocols used for setup allow the application to specify its requirements and discover link parameters. Acceptable values for service parameters may be negotiated. The packets transferred may include a connection identifier rather than address information and the packet header can be smaller, as it only needs to contain this code and any information, such as length, timestamp, or sequence number, which is different for different packets. In this case, address information is only transferred to each node during the connection setup phase, when the route to the destination is discovered and an entry is added to the switching table in each network node through which the connection passes. When a connection identifier is used, routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection identifier in a table.

Connection-oriented transport layer protocols such as TCP provide a connection-oriented service by using an underlying connectionless network. In this case, the end-to-end principle dictates that the end nodes, not the network itself, are responsible for the connection-oriented behavior.

==Packet switching in networks==
In telecommunication networks, packet switching is used to optimize the usage of channel capacity and increase robustness. Compared to circuit switching, packet switching is highly dynamic, allocating channel capacity based on usage instead of explicit reservations. This can reduce wasted capacity caused by underutilized reservations at the cost of removing bandwidth guarantees. In practice, congestion control is generally used in IP networks to dynamically negotiate capacity between connections. Packet switching may also increase the robustness of networks in the face of failures. If a node fails, connections do not need to be interrupted, as packets may be routed around the failure.

Packet switching is used in the Internet and most local area networks. The Internet is implemented by the Internet Protocol Suite using a variety of link layer technologies. For example, Ethernet and Frame Relay are common. Newer mobile phone technologies (e.g., GSM, LTE) also use packet switching. Packet switching is associated with connectionless networking because, in these systems, no connection agreement needs to be established between communicating parties prior to exchanging data.

X.25, the international CCITT standard of 1976, is a notable use of packet switching in that it provides to users a service of flow-controlled virtual circuits. These virtual circuits reliably carry variable-length packets with data order preservation. DATAPAC in Canada was the first public network to support X.25, followed by TRANSPAC in France.

Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is another virtual circuit technology. It differs from X.25 in that it uses small fixed-length packets (cells), and that the network imposes no flow control to users.

Technologies such as MPLS and the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) create virtual circuits on top of datagram networks. MPLS and its predecessors, as well as ATM, have been called &quot;fast packet&quot; technologies. MPLS, indeed, has been called &quot;ATM without cells&quot;. Virtual circuits are especially useful in building robust failover mechanisms and allocating bandwidth for delay-sensitive applications.

==Packet-switched networks==

Donald Davies&#x27; work on data communications and computer network design became well known in the United States, Europe and Japan and was the &quot;cornerstone&quot; that inspired numerous packet switching networks in the decade following. 

The history of packet-switched networks can be divided into three overlapping eras: early networks before the introduction of X.25; the X.25 era when many postal, telephone, and telegraph (PTT) companies provided public data networks with X.25 interfaces; and the Internet era which initially competed with the OSI model.

===Early networks===
Research into packet switching at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) began with a proposal for a wide-area network in 1965, and a local-area network in 1966. ARPANET funding was secured in 1966 by Bob Taylor, and planning began in 1967 when he hired Larry Roberts. The NPL network followed by the ARPANET became operational in 1969, the first two networks to use packet switching. Larry Roberts said many of the packet switching networks built in the 1970s were similar &quot;in nearly all respects&quot; to Donald Davies&#x27; original 1965 design.

Before the introduction of X.25 in 1976, about twenty different network technologies had been developed. Two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core. In the datagram system, operating according to the end-to-end principle, the hosts have the responsibility to ensure orderly delivery of packets. In the virtual call system, the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host. This results in a simpler host interface but complicates the network. The X.25 protocol suite uses this network type.

====AppleTalk====
AppleTalk is a proprietary suite of networking protocols developed by Apple in 1985 for Apple Macintosh computers. It was the primary protocol used by Apple devices through the 1980s and 1990s. AppleTalk included features that allowed local area networks to be established &quot;ad hoc&quot; without the requirement for a centralized router or server. The AppleTalk system automatically assigned addresses, updated the distributed namespace, and configured any required inter-network routing. It was a plug-n-play system.

AppleTalk implementations were also released for the IBM PC and compatibles, and the Apple IIGS. AppleTalk support was available in most networked printers, especially laser printers, some file servers and routers.

The protocol was designed to be simple, autoconfiguring, and not require servers or other specialized services to work. These benefits also created drawbacks, as Appletalk tended not to use bandwidth efficiently. AppleTalk support was terminated in 2009.

====ARPANET====
The ARPANET was a progenitor network of the Internet and one of the first networks, along with ARPA&#x27;s SATNET, to run the TCP/IP suite using packet switching technologies.

====BNRNET====
BNRNET was a network which Bell-Northern Research developed for internal use. It initially had only one host but was designed to support many hosts. BNR later made major contributions to the CCITT X.25 project.

====Cambridge Ring====

The Cambridge Ring was an experimental ring network developed at the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge. It operated from 1974 until the 1980s.

==== CompuServe ====
CompuServe developed its own packet switching network, implemented on DEC PDP-11 minicomputers acting as network nodes that were installed throughout the US (and later, in other countries) and interconnected. Over time, the CompuServe network evolved into a complicated multi-tiered network incorporating ATM, Frame Relay, IP and X.25 technologies.

====CYCLADES====
The CYCLADES packet switching network was a French research network designed and directed by Louis Pouzin. First demonstrated in 1973, it was developed to explore alternatives to the early ARPANET design and to support network research generally. It was the first network to use the end-to-end principle and make the hosts responsible for reliable delivery of data, rather than the network itself. Concepts of this network influenced later ARPANET architecture.

====DECnet====
DECnet is a suite of network protocols created by Digital Equipment Corporation, originally released in 1975 in order to connect two PDP-11 minicomputers. It evolved into one of the first peer-to-peer network architectures, thus transforming DEC into a networking powerhouse in the 1980s. Initially built with three layers, it later (1982) evolved into a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol. The DECnet protocols were designed entirely by Digital Equipment Corporation. However, DECnet Phase II (and later) were open standards with published specifications, and several implementations were developed outside DEC, including one for Linux.

====DDX-1====
DDX-1 was an experimental network from Nippon PTT. It mixed circuit switching and packet switching. It was succeeded by DDX-2.

==== EIN ====
The European Informatics Network (EIN), originally called COST 11, was a project beginning in 1971 to link networks in Britain, France, Italy, Switzerland and Euratom. Six other European countries also participated in the research on network protocols. Derek Barber directed the project, and Roger Scantlebury led the UK technical contribution; both were from NPL. The contract for its implementation was awarded to an Anglo French consortium led by the UK systems house Logica and Sesa and managed by Andrew Karney. Work began in 1973 and it became operational in 1976 including nodes linking the NPL network and CYCLADES. Barber proposed and implemented a mail protocol for EIN. The transport protocol of the EIN helped to launch the INWG and X.25 protocols. EIN was replaced by Euronet in 1979.

====EPSS====
The Experimental Packet Switched Service (EPSS) was an experiment of the UK Post Office Telecommunications. It was the first public data network in the UK when it began operating in 1976. Ferranti supplied the hardware and software. The handling of link control messages (acknowledgements and flow control) was different from that of most other networks.

====GEIS====
As General Electric Information Services (GEIS), General Electric was a major international provider of information services. The company originally designed a telephone network to serve as its internal (albeit continent-wide) voice telephone network.

In 1965, at the instigation of Warner Sinback, a data network based on this voice-phone network was designed to connect GE&#x27;s four computer sales and service centers (Schenectady, New York, Chicago, and Phoenix) to facilitate a computer time-sharing service.

After going international some years later, GEIS created a network data center near Cleveland, Ohio. Very little has been published about the internal details of their network. The design was hierarchical with redundant communication links.

====IPSANET====
IPSANET was a semi-private network constructed by I. P. Sharp Associates to serve their time-sharing customers. It became operational in May 1976.

====IPX/SPX====
The Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) and Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX) are Novell networking protocols from the 1980s derived from Xerox Network Systems&#x27; IDP and SPP protocols, respectively which date back to the 1970s. IPX/SPX was used primarily on networks using the Novell NetWare operating systems.

====Merit Network====
Merit Network, an independent nonprofit organization governed by Michigan&#x27;s public universities, was formed in 1966 as the Michigan Educational Research Information Triad to explore computer networking between three of Michigan&#x27;s public universities as a means to help the state&#x27;s educational and economic development. With initial support from the State of Michigan and the National Science Foundation (NSF), the packet-switched network was first demonstrated in December 1971 when an interactive host-to-host connection was made between the IBM mainframe systems at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Wayne State University in Detroit. In October 1972, connections to the CDC mainframe at Michigan State University in East Lansing completed the triad. Over the next several years, in addition to host-to-host interactive connections, the network was enhanced to support terminal-to-host connections, host-to-host batch connections (remote job submission, remote printing, batch file transfer), interactive file transfer, gateways to the Tymnet and Telenet public data networks, X.25 host attachments, gateways to X.25 data networks, Ethernet attached hosts, and eventually TCP/IP; additionally, public universities in Michigan joined the network. All of this set the stage for Merit&#x27;s role in the NSFNET project starting in the mid-1980s.

====NPL====
Donald Davies of the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) designed and proposed a national commercial data network based on packet switching in 1965. The proposal was not taken up nationally but the following year, he designed a local network using &quot;interface computers&quot;, today known as routers, to serve the needs of NPL and prove the feasibility of packet switching.

By 1968 Davies had begun building the NPL network to meet the needs of the multidisciplinary laboratory and prove the technology under operational conditions. In 1969, the NPL, followed by the ARPANET, were the first two networks to use packet switching. By 1976, 12 computers and 75 terminal devices were attached, and more were added until the network was replaced in 1986. NPL was the first to use high-speed links.

====Octopus====
Octopus was a local network at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. It connected sundry hosts at the lab to interactive terminals and various computer peripherals including a bulk storage system.

====Philips Research====
Philips Research Laboratories in Redhill, Surrey developed a packet switching network for internal use. It was a datagram network with a single switching node.

====PUP====
PARC Universal Packet (PUP or Pup) was one of the two earliest internetworking protocol suites; it was created by researchers at Xerox PARC in the mid-1970s. The entire suite provided routing and packet delivery, as well as higher level functions such as a reliable byte stream, along with numerous applications. Further developments led to Xerox Network Systems (XNS).

====RCP====
RCP was an experimental network created by the French PTT. It was used to gain experience with packet switching technology before the specification of the TRANSPAC public network was frozen. RCP was a virtual-circuit network in contrast to CYCLADES which was based on datagrams. RCP emphasised terminal-to-host and terminal-to-terminal connection; CYCLADES was concerned with host-to-host communication. RCP influenced the X.25 specification, which was deployed on TRANSPAC and other public data networks.

====RETD====
Red Especial de Transmisión de Datos (RETD) was a network developed by Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España. It became operational in 1972 and thus was the first public network.

====SCANNET====
&quot;The experimental packet-switched Nordic telecommunication network SCANNET was implemented in Nordic technical libraries in the 1970s, and it included first Nordic electronic journal Extemplo. Libraries were also among first ones in universities to accommodate microcomputers for public use in the early 1980s.&quot;

====SITA HLN====
SITA is a consortium of airlines. Its High Level Network (HLN) became operational in 1969. Although organised to act like a packet-switching network, it still used message switching. As with many non-academic networks, very little has been published about it.

====SRCnet/SERCnet====

A number of computer facilities serving the Science Research Council (SRC) community in the United Kingdom developed beginning in the early 1970s. Each had their own star network (ULCC London, UMRCC Manchester, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory). There were also regional networks centred on Bristol (on which work was initiated in the late 1960s) followed in the mid-late 1970s by Edinburgh, the Midlands and Newcastle. These groups of institutions shared resources to provide better computing facilities than could be afforded individually. The networks were each based on one manufacturer&#x27;s standards and were mutually incompatible and overlapping. In 1981, the SRC was renamed the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC). In the early 1980s a standardisation and interconnection effort started, hosted on an expansion of the SERCnet research network and based on the Coloured Book protocols, later evolving into JANET.

====Systems Network Architecture====
Systems Network Architecture (SNA) is IBM&#x27;s proprietary networking architecture created in 1974. An IBM customer could acquire hardware and software from IBM and lease private lines from a common carrier to construct a private network.

====Telenet====
Telenet was the first FCC-licensed public data network in the United States. Telenet was incorporated in 1973 and started operations in 1975. It was founded by Bolt Beranek &amp; Newman with Larry Roberts as CEO as a means of making packet switching technology public. Telenet initially used a proprietary Virtual circuit host interface, but changed it to X.25 and the terminal interface to X.29 after their standardization in CCITT. It went public in 1979 and was then sold to GTE.

====Tymnet====
Tymnet was an international data communications network headquartered in San Jose, CA. In 1969, it began install a network based on minicomputers to connect timesharing terminals to its central computers. The network used store-and-forward and voice-grade lines. Routing was not distributed, rather it was established by a central supervisor on a call-by-call basis.

===X.25 era===
There were two kinds of X.25 networks. Some such as DATAPAC and TRANSPAC were initially implemented with an X.25 external interface. Some older networks such as TELENET and TYMNET were modified to provide a X.25 host interface in addition to older host connection schemes. DATAPAC was developed by Bell-Northern Research which was a joint venture of Bell Canada (a common carrier) and Northern Telecom (a telecommunications equipment supplier). Northern Telecom sold several DATAPAC clones to foreign PTTs including the Deutsche Bundespost. X.75 and X.121 allowed the interconnection of national X.25 networks.

====AUSTPAC====
AUSTPAC was an Australian public X.25 network operated by Telstra. Established by Telstra&#x27;s predecessor Telecom Australia in the early 1980s, AUSTPAC was Australia&#x27;s first public packet-switched data network and supported applications such as on-line betting, financial applications—the Australian Tax Office made use of AUSTPAC—and remote terminal access to academic institutions, who maintained their connections to AUSTPAC up until the mid-late 1990s in some cases. Access was via a dial-up terminal to a PAD, or, by linking a permanent X.25 node to the network.

====ConnNet====
ConnNet was a network operated by the Southern New England Telephone Company serving the state of Connecticut. Launched on March 11, 1985, it was the first local public packet-switched network in the United States.

====Datanet 1====
Datanet 1 was the public switched data network operated by the Dutch PTT Telecom (now known as KPN). Strictly speaking Datanet 1 only referred to the network and the connected users via leased lines (using the X.121 DNIC 2041), the name also referred to the public PAD service &quot;Telepad&quot; (using the DNIC 2049). And because the main Videotex service used the network and modified PAD devices as infrastructure the name Datanet 1 was used for these services as well.

====DATAPAC====
DATAPAC was the first operational X.25 network (1976). It covered major Canadian cities and was eventually extended to smaller centers.

====Datex-P====
Deutsche Bundespost operated the Datex-P national network in Germany. The technology was acquired from Northern Telecom.

==== Eirpac ====
Eirpac is the Irish public switched data network supporting X.25 and X.28. It was launched in 1984, replacing Euronet. Eirpac is run by Eircom.

====Euronet====
Nine member states of the European Economic Community contracted with Logica and the French company SESA to set up a joint venture in 1975 to undertake the &quot;Euronet&quot; development, using X.25 protocols to form virtual circuits. It was to replace EIN and established a network in 1979 linking a number of European countries until 1984 when the network was handed over to national PTTs.

====HIPA-NET====
Hitachi designed a private network system for sale as a turnkey package to multi-national organizations. In addition to providing X.25 packet switching, message switching software was also included. Messages were buffered at the nodes adjacent to the sending and receiving terminals. Switched virtual calls were not supported, but through the use of &quot;logical ports&quot; an originating terminal could have a menu of pre-defined destination terminals.

====Iberpac====
Iberpac is the Spanish public packet-switched network, providing X.25 services. It was based on RETD which was operational since 1972. Iberpac was run by Telefonica.

====IPSS====
In 1978, X.25 provided the first international and commercial packet-switching network, the International Packet Switched Service (IPSS).

====JANET====
JANET was the UK academic and research network, linking all universities, higher education establishments, and publicly funded research laboratories following its launch in 1984. The X.25 network, which used the Coloured Book protocols, was based mainly on GEC 4000 series switches, and ran X.25 links at up to in its final phase before being converted to an IP-based network in 1991. The JANET network grew out of the 1970s SRCnet, later called SERCnet.

====PSS====
Packet Switch Stream (PSS) was the Post Office Telecommunications (later to become British Telecom) national X.25 network with a DNIC of 2342. British Telecom renamed PSS Global Network Service (GNS), but the PSS name has remained better known. PSS also included public dial-up PAD access, and various InterStream gateways to other services such as Telex.

==== REXPAC ====
REXPAC was the nationwide experimental packet switching data network in Brazil, developed by the research and development center of Telebrás, the state-owned public telecommunications provider.

====SITA Data Transport Network====
SITA is a consortium of airlines. Its Data Transport Network adopted X.25 in 1981, becoming the world&#x27;s most extensive packet-switching network. As with many non-academic networks, very little has been published about it.

====TRANSPAC====
TRANSPAC was the national X.25 network in France. It was developed locally at about the same time as DATAPAC in Canada. The development was done by the French PTT and influenced by its preceding expreimental networkRCP. It began operation in 1978, and served commercial users and, after Minitel began, consumers.

====Tymnet====
Tymnet utilized virtual call packet switched technology including X.25, SNA/SDLC, BSC and ASCII interfaces to connect host computers (servers) at thousands of large companies, educational institutions, and government agencies. Users typically connected via dial-up connections or dedicated asynchronous serial connections. The business consisted of a large public network that supported dial-up users and a private network business that allowed government agencies and large companies (mostly banks and airlines) to build their own dedicated networks. The private networks were often connected via gateways to the public network to reach locations not on the private network. Tymnet was also connected to dozens of other public networks in the U.S. and internationally via X.25/X.75 gateways.

==== UNINETT ====
UNINETT was a wide-area Norwegian packet-switched network established through a joint effort between Norwegian universities, research institutions and the Norwegian Telecommunication administration. The original network was based on X.25; Internet protocols were adopted later.

====VENUS-P====
VENUS-P was an international X.25 network that operated from April 1982 through March 2006. At its subscription peak in 1999, VENUS-P connected 207 networks in 87 countries.

====XNS====
Xerox Network Systems (XNS) was a protocol suite promulgated by Xerox, which provided routing and packet delivery, as well as higher level functions such as a reliable stream, and remote procedure calls. It was developed from PARC Universal Packet (PUP).

===Internet era===

When Internet connectivity was made available to anyone who could pay for an Internet service provider subscription, the distinctions between national networks blurred. The user no longer saw network identifiers such as the DNIC. Some older technologies such as circuit switching have resurfaced with new names such as fast packet switching. Researchers have created some experimental networks to complement the existing Internet.

====CSNET====
The Computer Science Network (CSNET) was a computer network funded by the NSF that began operation in 1981. Its purpose was to extend networking benefits for computer science departments at academic and research institutions that could not be directly connected to ARPANET due to funding or authorization limitations. It played a significant role in spreading awareness of, and access to, national networking and was a major milestone on the path to the development of the global Internet.

====Internet2====
Internet2 is a not-for-profit United States computer networking consortium led by members from the research and education communities, industry, and government. The Internet2 community, in partnership with Qwest, built the first Internet2 Network, called Abilene, in 1998 and was a prime investor in the National LambdaRail (NLR) project. In 2006, Internet2 announced a partnership with Level 3 Communications to launch a brand new nationwide network, boosting its capacity from 10 to . In October, 2007, Internet2 officially retired Abilene and now refers to its new, higher capacity network as the Internet2 Network.

====NSFNET====
The National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) was a program of coordinated, evolving projects sponsored by the NSF beginning in 1985 to promote advanced research and education networking in the United States. NSFNET was also the name given to several nationwide backbone networks, operating at speeds of , (T1), and (T3), that were constructed to support NSF&#x27;s networking initiatives from 1985 to 1995. Initially created to link researchers to the nation&#x27;s NSF-funded supercomputing centers, through further public funding and private industry partnerships it developed into a major part of the Internet backbone.

====NSFNET regional networks====
In addition to the five NSF supercomputer centers, NSFNET provided connectivity to eleven regional networks and through these networks to many smaller regional and campus networks in the United States. The NSFNET regional networks were:
*BARRNet, the Bay Area Regional Research Network in Palo Alto, California;
*CERFnet, California Education and Research Federation Network in San Diego, California, serving California and Nevada;
*CICNet, the Committee on Institutional Cooperation Network via the Merit Network in Ann Arbor, Michigan and later as part of the T3 upgrade via Argonne National Laboratory outside of Chicago, serving the Big Ten Universities and the University of Chicago in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin;
*Merit/MichNet in Ann Arbor, Michigan serving Michigan, formed in 1966, still in operation ;
*MIDnet in Lincoln, Nebraska serving Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and South Dakota;
*NEARNET, the New England Academic and Research Network in Cambridge, Massachusetts, added as part of the upgrade to T3, serving Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, established in late 1988, operated by BBN under contract to MIT, BBN assumed responsibility for NEARNET on 1 July 1993;
*NorthWestNet in Seattle, Washington, serving Alaska, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, and Washington, founded in 1987;
*NYSERNet, New York State Education and Research Network in Ithaca, New York;
*JVNCNet, the John von Neumann National Supercomputer Center Network in Princeton, New Jersey, serving Delaware and New Jersey;
*SESQUINET, the Sesquicentennial Network in Houston, Texas, founded during the 150th anniversary of the State of Texas;
*SURAnet, the Southeastern Universities Research Association network in College Park, Maryland and later as part of the T3 upgrade in Atlanta, Georgia serving Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, sold to BBN in 1994; and
*Westnet in Salt Lake City, Utah and Boulder, Colorado, serving Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming.

====National LambdaRail====
The National LambdaRail (NRL) was launched in September 2003. It is a 12,000-mile high-speed national computer network owned and operated by the US research and education community that runs over fiber-optic lines. It was the first transcontinental 10 Gigabit Ethernet network. It operates with an aggregate capacity of up to and a bitrate. NLR ceased operations in March 2014.

==== TransPAC2, and TransPAC3====
TransPAC2 is a high-speed international Internet service connecting research and education networks in the Asia-Pacific region to those in the US. TransPAC3 is part of the NSF&#x27;s International Research Network Connections (IRNC) program.

====Very high-speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS)====
The Very high-speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS) came on line in April 1995 as part of a NSF sponsored project to provide high-speed interconnection between NSF-sponsored supercomputing centers and select access points in the United States. The network was engineered and operated by MCI Telecommunications under a cooperative agreement with the NSF. By 1998, the vBNS had grown to connect more than 100 universities and research and engineering institutions via 12 national points of presence with DS-3 (), OC-3c (), and OC-12 () links on an all OC-12 backbone, a substantial engineering feat for that time. The vBNS installed one of the first ever production OC-48 () IP links in February 1999 and went on to upgrade the entire backbone to OC-48.

In June 1999 MCI WorldCom introduced vBNS+ which allowed attachments to the vBNS network by organizations that were not approved by or receiving support from NSF. After the expiration of the NSF agreement, the vBNS largely transitioned to providing service to the government. Most universities and research centers migrated to the Internet2 educational backbone. In January 2006, when MCI and Verizon merged, vBNS+ became a service of Verizon Business.

<text>In computing, Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a secure network protocol suite that authenticates and encrypts packets of data to provide secure encrypted communication between two computers over an Internet Protocol network. It is used in virtual private networks (VPNs).

IPsec includes protocols for establishing mutual authentication between agents at the beginning of a session and negotiation of cryptographic keys to use during the session. IPsec can protect data flows between a pair of hosts (&quot;host-to-host&quot;), between a pair of security gateways (&quot;network-to-network&quot;), or between a security gateway and a host (&quot;network-to-host&quot;).
IPsec uses cryptographic security services to protect communications over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It supports network-level peer authentication, data origin authentication, data integrity, data confidentiality (encryption), and protection from replay attacks.

The protocol was designed by a committee instead of being designed via a competition. Some experts criticized it, stating that it is complex and with a lot of options, which has a devastating effect on a security standard. There is alleged interference of NSA to weaken its security features.

==History==
Starting in the early 1970s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency sponsored a series of experimental ARPANET encryption devices, at first for native ARPANET packet encryption and subsequently for TCP/IP packet encryption; some of these were certified and fielded. From 1986 to 1991, the NSA sponsored the development of security protocols for the Internet under its Secure Data Network Systems (SDNS) program. This brought together various vendors including Motorola who produced a network encryption device in 1988. The work was openly published from about 1988 by NIST and, of these, &quot;Security Protocol at Layer 3&quot; (SP3) would eventually morph into the ISO standard Network Layer Security Protocol (NLSP).

In 1992, the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) was funded by DARPA CSTO to implement IPv6 and to research and implement IP encryption in 4.4 BSD, supporting both SPARC and x86 CPU architectures. DARPA made its implementation freely available via MIT. Under NRL&#x27;s DARPA-funded research effort, NRL developed the IETF standards-track specifications (RFC 1825 through RFC 1827) for IPsec. NRL&#x27;s IPsec implementation was described in their paper in the 1996 USENIX Conference Proceedings. NRL&#x27;s open-source IPsec implementation was made available online by MIT and became the basis for most initial commercial implementations.

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) formed the IP Security Working Group in 1992 to standardize openly specified security extensions to IP, called &quot;IPsec&quot;. The NRL developed standards were published by the IETF as RFC 1825 through RFC 1827.

==Security architecture==
The initial IPv4 suite was developed with few security provisions. As a part of the IPv4 enhancement, IPsec is a layer 3 OSI model or internet layer end-to-end security scheme. In contrast, while some other Internet security systems in widespread use operate above the network layer, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) that operates above the transport layer and Secure Shell (SSH) that operates at the application layer, IPsec can automatically secure applications at the internet layer.

IPsec is an open standard as a part of the IPv4 suite and uses the following protocols to perform various functions:

* Authentication Header (AH) provides connectionless data integrity and data origin authentication for IP datagrams and provides protection against IP header modification attacks and replay attacks.
* Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) provides confidentiality, connectionless data integrity, data origin authentication, an anti-replay service (a form of partial sequence integrity), and limited traffic-flow confidentiality.

* Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) provides a framework for authentication and key exchange, with actual authenticated keying material provided either by manual configuration with pre-shared keys, Internet Key Exchange (IKE and IKEv2), Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys (KINK), or IPSECKEY DNS records. The purpose is to generate the security associations (SA) with the bundle of algorithms and parameters necessary for AH and/or ESP operations.

===Authentication Header===

The Security Authentication Header (AH) was developed at the US Naval Research Laboratory in the early 1990s and is derived in part from previous IETF standards&#x27; work for authentication of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) version 2. Authentication Header (AH) is a member of the IPsec protocol suite. AH ensures connectionless integrity by using a hash function and a secret shared key in the AH algorithm. AH also guarantees the data origin by authenticating IP packets. Optionally a sequence number can protect the IPsec packet&#x27;s contents against replay attacks, using the sliding window technique and discarding old packets.

* In IPv4, AH prevents option-insertion attacks. In IPv6, AH protects both against header insertion attacks and option insertion attacks.
* In IPv4, the AH protects the IP payload and all header fields of an IP datagram except for mutable fields (i.e. those that might be altered in transit), and also IP options such as the IP Security Option. Mutable (and therefore unauthenticated) IPv4 header fields are DSCP/ToS, ECN, Flags, Fragment Offset, TTL and Header Checksum.
* In IPv6, the AH protects most of the IPv6 base header, AH itself, non-mutable extension headers after the AH, and the IP payload. Protection for the IPv6 header excludes the mutable fields: DSCP, ECN, Flow Label, and Hop Limit.
AH operates directly on top of IP, using IP protocol number.

The following AH packet diagram shows how an AH packet is constructed and interpreted:

===Encapsulating Security Payload===

The IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) was developed at the Naval Research Laboratory starting in 1992 as part of a DARPA-sponsored research project, and was openly published by IETF SIPP Working Group drafted in December 1993 as a security extension for SIPP. This ESP was originally derived from the US Department of Defense SP3D protocol, rather than being derived from the ISO Network-Layer Security Protocol (NLSP). The SP3D protocol specification was published by NIST in the late 1980s, but designed by the Secure Data Network System project of the US Department of Defense. 
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) is a member of the IPsec protocol suite. It provides origin authenticity through source authentication, data integrity through hash functions and confidentiality through encryption protection for IP packets. ESP also supports encryption-only and authentication-only configurations, but using encryption without authentication is strongly discouraged because it is insecure.

Unlike Authentication Header (AH), ESP in transport mode does not provide integrity and authentication for the entire IP packet. However, in tunnel mode, where the entire original IP packet is encapsulated with a new packet header added, ESP protection is afforded to the whole inner IP packet (including the inner header) while the outer header (including any outer IPv4 options or IPv6 extension headers) remains unprotected.

ESP operates directly on top of IP, using IP protocol number 50.

The following ESP packet diagram shows how an ESP packet is constructed and interpreted:

===Security association===

The IPsec protocols use a security association, where the communicating parties establish shared security attributes such as algorithms and keys. As such, IPsec provides a range of options once it has been determined whether AH or ESP is used. Before exchanging data, the two hosts agree on which symmetric encryption algorithm is used to encrypt the IP packet, for example AES or ChaCha20, and which hash function is used to ensure the integrity of the data, such as BLAKE2 or SHA256. These parameters are agreed for the particular session, for which a lifetime must be agreed and a session key.

The algorithm for authentication is also agreed before the data transfer takes place and IPsec supports a range of methods. Authentication is possible through pre-shared key, where a symmetric key is already in the possession of both hosts, and the hosts send each other hashes of the shared key to prove that they are in possession of the same key. IPsec also supports public key encryption, where each host has a public and a private key, they exchange their public keys and each host sends the other a nonce encrypted with the other host&#x27;s public key. Alternatively if both hosts hold a public key certificate from a certificate authority, this can be used for IPsec authentication.

The security associations of IPsec are established using the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP). ISAKMP is implemented by manual configuration with pre-shared secrets, Internet Key Exchange (IKE and IKEv2), Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys (KINK), and the use of IPSECKEY DNS records. RFC 5386 defines Better-Than-Nothing Security (BTNS) as an unauthenticated mode of IPsec using an extended IKE protocol. C. Meadows, C. Cremers, and others have used formal methods to identify various anomalies which exist in IKEv1 and also in IKEv2.

In order to decide what protection is to be provided for an outgoing packet, IPsec uses the Security Parameter Index (SPI), an index to the security association database (SADB), along with the destination address in a packet header, which together uniquely identifies a security association for that packet. A similar procedure is performed for an incoming packet, where IPsec gathers decryption and verification keys from the security association database.

For IP multicast a security association is provided for the group, and is duplicated across all authorized receivers of the group. There may be more than one security association for a group, using different SPIs, thereby allowing multiple levels and sets of security within a group. Indeed, each sender can have multiple security associations, allowing authentication, since a receiver can only know that someone knowing the keys sent the data. Note that the relevant standard does not describe how the association is chosen and duplicated across the group; it is assumed that a responsible party will have made the choice.

==Keepalives==
To ensure that the connection between two endpoints has not been interrupted, endpoints exchange keepalive messages at regular intervals, which can also be used to automatically reestablish a tunnel lost due to connection interruption.
Dead Peer Detection (DPD) is a method of detecting a dead Internet Key Exchange (IKE) peer. The method uses IPsec traffic patterns to minimize the number of messages required to confirm the availability of a peer. DPD is used to reclaim the lost resources in case a peer is found dead and it is also used to perform IKE peer failover.

UDP keepalive is an alternative to DPD.

==Modes of operation==
The IPsec protocols AH and ESP can be implemented in a host-to-host transport mode, as well as in a network tunneling mode.
===Transport mode===
In transport mode, only the payload of the IP packet is usually encrypted or authenticated. The routing is intact, since the IP header is neither modified nor encrypted; however, when the authentication header is used, the IP addresses cannot be modified by network address translation, as this always invalidates the hash value. The transport and application layers are always secured by a hash, so they cannot be modified in any way, for example by translating the port numbers.

A means to encapsulate IPsec messages for NAT traversal (NAT-T) has been defined by RFC documents describing the NAT-T mechanism.

===Tunnel mode ===
In tunnel mode, the entire IP packet is encrypted and authenticated. It is then encapsulated into a new IP packet with a new IP header. Tunnel mode is used to create virtual private networks for network-to-network communications (e.g. between routers to link sites), host-to-network communications (e.g. remote user access) and host-to-host communications (e.g. private chat).

Tunnel mode supports NAT traversal.

== Algorithms ==
===Symmetric encryption algorithms===
Cryptographic algorithms defined for use with IPsec include:
* HMAC-SHA1/SHA2 for integrity protection and authenticity.
* TripleDES-CBC for confidentiality
* AES-CBC and AES-CTR for confidentiality.
* AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 providing confidentiality and authentication together efficiently.

Refer to RFC 8221 for details.

===Key exchange algorithms===
* Diffie–Hellman (RFC 3526)
* ECDH (RFC 4753)

===Authentication algorithms===
* RSA
* ECDSA (RFC 4754)
* PSK (RFC 6617)
* EdDSA (RFC 8420)

==Implementations==
The IPsec can be implemented in the IP stack of an operating system. This method of implementation is done for hosts and security gateways. Various IPsec capable IP stacks are available from companies, such as HP or IBM. An alternative is so called bump-in-the-stack (BITS) implementation, where the operating system source code does not have to be modified. Here IPsec is installed between the IP stack and the network drivers. This way operating systems can be retrofitted with IPsec. This method of implementation is also used for both hosts and gateways. However, when retrofitting IPsec the encapsulation of IP packets may cause problems for the automatic path MTU discovery, where the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size on the network path between two IP hosts is established. If a host or gateway has a separate cryptoprocessor, which is common in the military and can also be found in commercial systems, a so-called bump-in-the-wire (BITW) implementation of IPsec is possible.

When IPsec is implemented in the kernel, the key management and ISAKMP/IKE negotiation is carried out from user space. The NRL-developed and openly specified &quot;PF_KEY Key Management API, Version 2&quot; is often used to enable the application-space key management application to update the IPsec security associations stored within the kernel-space IPsec implementation. Existing IPsec implementations usually include ESP, AH, and IKE version 2. Existing IPsec implementations on Unix-like operating systems, for example, Solaris or Linux, usually include PF_KEY version 2.

Embedded IPsec can be used to ensure the secure communication among applications running over constrained resource systems with a small overhead.

==Standards status==
IPsec was developed in conjunction with IPv6 and was originally required to be supported by all standards-compliant implementations of IPv6 before RFC 6434 made it only a recommendation. IPsec is also optional for IPv4 implementations. IPsec is most commonly used to secure IPv4 traffic.

IPsec protocols were originally defined in RFC 1825 through RFC 1829, which were published in 1995. In 1998, these documents were superseded by RFC 2401 and RFC 2412 with a few incompatible engineering details, although they were conceptually identical. In addition, a mutual authentication and key exchange protocol Internet Key Exchange (IKE) was defined to create and manage security associations. In December 2005, new standards were defined in RFC 4301 and RFC 4309 which are largely a superset of the previous editions with a second version of the Internet Key Exchange standard IKEv2. These third-generation documents standardized the abbreviation of IPsec to uppercase &quot;IP&quot; and lowercase &quot;sec&quot;. &quot;ESP&quot; generally refers to RFC 4303, which is the most recent version of the specification.

Since mid-2008, an IPsec Maintenance and Extensions (ipsecme) working group is active at the IETF.

==Alleged NSA interference==
In 2013, as part of Snowden leaks, it was revealed that the US National Security Agency had been actively working to &quot;Insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems, IT systems, networks, and endpoint communications devices used by targets&quot; as part of the Bullrun program. There are allegations that IPsec was a targeted encryption system.

The OpenBSD IPsec stack came later on and also was widely copied. In a letter which OpenBSD lead developer Theo de Raadt received on 11 Dec 2010 from Gregory Perry, it is alleged that Jason Wright and others, working for the FBI, inserted &quot;a number of backdoors and side channel key leaking mechanisms&quot; into the OpenBSD crypto code. In the forwarded email from 2010, Theo de Raadt did not at first express an official position on the validity of the claims, apart from the implicit endorsement from forwarding the email. Jason Wright&#x27;s response to the allegations: &quot;Every urban legend is made more real by the inclusion of real names, dates, and times. Gregory Perry&#x27;s email falls into this category. ... I will state clearly that I did not add backdoors to the OpenBSD operating system or the OpenBSD Cryptographic Framework (OCF).&quot; Some days later, de Raadt commented that &quot;I believe that NETSEC was probably contracted to write backdoors as alleged. ... If those were written, I don&#x27;t believe they made it into our tree.&quot; This was published before the Snowden leaks.

An alternative explanation put forward by the authors of the Logjam attack suggests that the NSA compromised IPsec VPNs by undermining the Diffie-Hellman algorithm used in the key exchange. In their paper, they allege the NSA specially built a computing cluster to precompute multiplicative subgroups for specific primes and generators, such as for the second Oakley group defined in RFC 2409. As of May 2015, 90% of addressable IPsec VPNs supported the second Oakley group as part of IKE. If an organization were to precompute this group, they could derive the keys being exchanged and decrypt traffic without inserting any software backdoors.

A second alternative explanation that was put forward was that the Equation Group used zero-day exploits against several manufacturers&#x27; VPN equipment which were validated by Kaspersky Lab as being tied to the Equation Group and validated by those manufacturers as being real exploits, some of which were zero-day exploits at the time of their exposure. The Cisco PIX and ASA firewalls had vulnerabilities that were used for wiretapping by the NSA.

Furthermore, IPsec VPNs using &quot;Aggressive Mode&quot; settings send a hash of the PSK in the clear. This can be and apparently is targeted by the NSA using offline dictionary attacks.

<text>Telluride is the county seat and most populous town of San Miguel County in the southwestern portion of the U.S. state of Colorado. The town is a former silver mining camp on the San Miguel River in the western San Juan Mountains. The first gold mining claim was made in the mountains above Telluride in 1875, and early settlement of what is now Telluride followed. The town was founded in 1878.

Telluride sits in a box canyon. Steep forested mountains and cliffs surround it, with Bridal Veil Falls situated at the canyon&#x27;s head. Numerous weathered ruins of old mining operations dot the hillsides. A free gondola connects the town with its companion town, Mountain Village, at the base of the ski area. Telluride and the surrounding area have featured prominently in popular culture, and it is the subject of several popular songs. It is especially known for its ski resort and slopes during the winter, as well as an extensive festival schedule during the summer, including the Hot Air Balloon Festival, which traditionally occurs the first weekend in June.

The Telluride Historic District, which includes a significant portion of the town, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is also one of Colorado&#x27;s 20 National Historic Landmarks. The town population was 2,607 in the 2020 United States census.

== History ==
===Mining days===
Gold was first discovered in Colorado near present-day Denver, setting off the Pike&#x27;s Peak gold rush of 1858. The Smuggler gold vein above Telluride, and placer gold in the San Miguel River, were discovered in 1875. John Fallon made the first claim in Marshal Basin above Telluride in 1875 and settlement followed. The town of Columbia was founded in 1878. The Telluride, Colorado, post office opened at Columbia on July 26, 1880, since the United States Post Office Department would not approve the name Columbia. Columbia (Telluride since 1887) has been the seat of San Miguel County, Colorado, since the county was created on March 2, 1883. The Town of Columbia was incorporated on February 10, 1887, but the town changed its name to the Town of Telluride a few months later. The town was named after valuable ore compounds of the chemical element tellurium, a metalloid element which forms natural tellurides, the most notable of which are telluride ores of gold and silver. Although gold telluride minerals were never actually found in the mountains near Telluride, the area&#x27;s mines were rich in zinc, lead, copper, silver, and ores which contained gold in other forms.

Telluride began slowly because of its isolated location. In 1881, a toll road was opened by Otto Mears, which allowed wagons to go where only pack mules could go before. This increased the number of people in Telluride, but it was still expensive to get gold-rich ore out of the valley.

In June 1889, Butch Cassidy, before becoming associated with his gang, the &quot;Wild Bunch&quot;, robbed the San Miguel Valley Bank in Telluride. This was his first major recorded crime. He exited the bank with $24,580 (equal to $ today) and later became famous as a bank robber.

In 1891, the Rio Grande Southern Railroad, also begun by Mears, arrived in Telluride, eventually building a two-stall engine house, water facilities, a section house and a bunkhouse, sidings, and a depot. It continued further up the valley to end its Telluride branch at Pandora, serving the mines and the town until 1952. The cheaper and consistent transportation for passengers and freight allowed miners and goods to flow into the San Miguel town and ore to flow out to the mills and foundries elsewhere. This brought a brief but unprecedented boom to Telluride before the Panic of 1893.

Around the turn of the 20th century, there were serious labor disputes in the mines near Telluride. The Colorado National Guard was called out and there were deaths on both sides. Unions were formed as miners joined the Western Federation of Miners in 1896. 1899 brought big changes as union strike action led most mines to grant miners $3 a day for an 8-hour day&#x27;s work plus a boarding pay of $1 a day (equal to $ today). At this time, workers were putting in 10- to 12-hour days and the mines ran 24 hours a day. Work conditions were treacherous, with mines above , a lack of safety measures, and bitter weather in winter months. Even the boarding houses were precariously placed on the mountainsides.

Telluride&#x27;s labor unrest occurred against the backdrop of a statewide struggle between miners and mine owners. Bulkeley Wells was one mine operator considerably hostile to the union. The Telluride Miners&#x27; Union was led by Vincent St. John. The disappearance of mine guard William J. Barney, which Wells declared a &quot;murder&quot;, created much intrigue and national interest. The accusations, animosity, gunplay, and expulsions that followed were part of an ongoing struggle throughout Colorado&#x27;s mining communities which came to be called the Colorado Labor Wars.

In 1891, Telluride&#x27;s L. L. Nunn joined forces with George Westinghouse to build the Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant, an alternating current power station, near Telluride. The plant supplied power to the Gold King Mine away. This was the first successful demonstration of long-distance transmission of industrial-grade alternating current power and used two Westinghouse alternators, one working as a generator producing 3,000 volts, 133 Hertz, single-phase AC, and the other used as an AC motor. This hydroelectric AC power plant predated the Westinghouse plant at Niagara Falls by four years. Nunn and his brother Paul built power plants in Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Montana, Mexico, and the Ontario Power plant at Niagara Falls on the Canadian side. Nunn developed a keen interest in education as part of his electrical power companies, and in conjunction with Cornell University built the Telluride House at Cornell in 1909 to educate promising students in electrical engineering. Later, Nunn along with Charles Walcott, started the non-profit Telluride Association. Nunn founded Deep Springs College in 1917. 

Telluride&#x27;s most famous historic mines are the Tomboy, Pandora, Smuggler-Union, Nellie, and Sheridan mines. Beginning in 1939, the hard-rock mining operations in the Red Mountain and Telluride mining districts began a lengthy consolidation under the Idarado Mining Company (Idarado), now a division of Newmont Mining. The consolidation ended in 1953 with Idarado&#x27;s acquisition of the Telluride Mines. Idarado kept the underground workings and mill operations open at Telluride&#x27;s Pandora hard-rock mine until 1978. When the mine officially closed, the snow which tormented Telluride&#x27;s miners became the town&#x27;s new source of income, in the form of skiing and tourism. The documentary video &quot;the YX factor&quot; chronicles the transition from mining to skiing and the influx of &quot;hippies&quot; in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the words of local residents and commentators such as Peter Yarrow and Tom Hayden.

===Skiing era===
Mining was Telluride&#x27;s only industry until 1972 when the first ski lift was installed by Telluride Ski Resort founder Joseph T. Zoline and his Telluride Ski Corporation (Telco). Zoline bought the land for the future resort in 1969 and began to craft the slopes. Along with his mountain manager, Telluride native Bill &quot;Sr.&quot; Mahoney, they slowly and thoughtfully put together a plan for the sustained development of Telluride and the region. As mining phased out and a new service industry phased in, the local population changed sharply. Mining families fled Telluride to settle in places like Moab, Utah, where uranium mining offered hope of continued employment. Mining families were replaced by what locals referred to as &quot;hippies&quot;, young people with a 1960s worldview that often clashed with the values of Telluride&#x27;s old-timers. These newcomers were characterized as idle &quot;trust funders&quot; drawn to the town for a casual lifestyle and outdoor excitements such as hang gliding, mountain climbing, and kayaking.

The new population opposed town growth and economic expansion, including growth due to tourism and skiing. At one point, a serious effort was made to ban cars from the city limits and force visitors to use horse-drawn carts. The 1970s had fluctuating snowfalls and economic recession, but the town&#x27;s music and film festivals flourished. They exposed hundreds of thousands to the grandeur of the valley for the first time and created iconic associations with elite entertainers. Meanwhile, ski area founder Joe Zoline worked to develop one of the best mountains in North America for expert skiers, and created the infrastructure for tourism that respected Telluride&#x27;s need to stay small.

As the final ore carts were rolling out of the Pandora mine, tourists began to discover Telluride&#x27;s views, skiing, and autumn color changes. After the brutal snow drought of 1976 nearly wiped out the embryonic ski and lodging industry, the town started to rebound economically. In 1978, Ron Allred and his partner Jim Wells bought a stake in the ski area to form the Telluride Company. They expanded the infrastructure by adding a gondola connecting Telluride with the Mountain Village.

During the 1980s, Telluride developed a reputation as &quot;Colorado&#x27;s best-kept secret&quot;, which paradoxically made it one of the better-known resort communities. Wealthy skiers flocked to the mountain all winter, and sightseers kept hotel rooms full all summer. Telluride also became notorious in the drug counterculture as a drop point for Mexican smugglers and a favorite place for wealthy importers to enjoy downtime. The town was even featured in the hit song by Glenn Frey from &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, &quot;Smugglers Blues&quot;. Telluride was living up to its Wild West history. This type of attention helped differentiate it from Aspen. The festivals and Telluride&#x27;s bad-boy image attracted celebrities like Tom Cruise, Oprah Winfrey, and Oliver Stone. By the mid-1990s, Telluride had shed both its mining personality and drug image to establish itself as a premier resort town balancing modern culture with fascinating western history. In 2003, Prospect Bowl, an extension to the ski area opened, providing the resort with many new trails and runs. Most lifts in the area are high-speed quad chairs capable of holding four passengers. The highest lift on the mountain reaches .

==Geography==
Telluride has an elevation of in an isolated spot in Southwest Colorado. From the west, Colorado Route 145 is the most common way into Telluride; two other passes enter the town, Imogene Pass and Black Bear Pass.

On the eastern side of town, there are two waterfalls: Ingram Falls, which is visible from town, and Bridal Veil Falls and the Bridal Veil Hydroelectric plant, which are just out of sight from town to the right of Ingram. The power plant house was leased for some time by Eric Jacobson, who restored the house and the generator inside. The hydroelectric plant was built in 1895 to power the Smuggler-Union Mine.

The town is served by air transportation via Telluride Regional Airport (TEX), once the highest elevation commercial airport in the United States at . The airport is considered challenging by pilots because of frequent adverse weather conditions, high elevation, and the extremely rugged mountain terrain surrounding the airport on nearly all sides. Major airline service is provided seasonally into Montrose (MTJ), approximately north by road.

===Climate===
Telluride has a humid continental climate (Dfb). The coldest month is January, averaging , and the hottest July, which averages . Precipitation peaks as snow in winter and as thunderstorms in summer with a dry period in late spring. Telluride gets moderate precipitation all year due to its altitude, averaging of water equivalent precipitation, including inches of snow, each year.

==Transportation==
Telluride is served by Telluride Regional Airport. Scheduled flight options are limited, due to the airport&#x27;s somewhat short runway and frequent closures under bad weather, so most passengers going to Telluride use Montrose Regional Airport, to the north.

Free public transportation is provided in Telluride. The bus system, called &quot;Galloping Goose&quot;, makes a complete loop around the town. A gondola lift links Telluride with Mountain Village.

Telluride&#x27;s free gondola is the only one of its kind in North America. It stops at four stations: Telluride, St. Sophia, and two stops in Mountain Village. It was the first leg of a transportation agreement for the Telluride Region that was stipulated as part of the Mountain Village zoning expansion that would provide free gondola service from the Town of Telluride and the Mountain Village to the Aldasoro Development, the West Meadows Development, the Valley Floor Development, and the West Meadows Development to virtually eliminate the use or need for a car in the Telluride Region of San Miguel County. It is a 13-minute ride and reaches an elevation of at the San Sophia station.

Regional bus service is provided by the San Miguel Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART).

Telluride is part of Colorado&#x27;s Bustang intercity bus service network. It is on the Durango-Grand Junction Outrider line.
;Major highways
* State Highway 145 is part of the San Juan Skyway. It connects Telluride to Cortez and Naturita. This road also gives access to State Highway 62, the main route to Denver, Montrose and other important places in Colorado.

==In popular culture==

Clive Cussler&#x27;s 1998 novel &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; is partially set in Telluride. The novel features signs of an ancient civilization being found in an underground chamber next to a mine outside the city.

In Justin Cronin&#x27;s 2010 novel &quot;The Passage&quot;, Telluride is the site of a secret military compound used to test a purported &quot;longevity drug&quot; on death row inmates.

The production of &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot; directed by Quentin Tarantino began filming near Telluride in January 2015.

The Coen brothers 2018 film &quot;The Ballad of Buster Scruggs&quot; used Telluride as a filming location for the vignette &quot;All Gold Canyon&quot;, based on a short story by Jack London.

The Kia Telluride vehicle is named after the town.

<doc id="43351" wikidata="Q185905" url="?curid=43351" title="Ukiyo-e">
<text>Ukiyo-e (浮世絵) is a genre of Japanese art that flourished from the 17th through 19th centuries. Its artists produced woodblock prints and paintings of such subjects as female beauties; kabuki actors and sumo wrestlers; scenes from history and folk tales; travel scenes and landscapes; flora and fauna; and erotica. The term translates as &#x27;picture[s] of the floating world&#x27;.

In 1603, the city of Edo (Tokyo) became the seat of the ruling Tokugawa shogunate. The class (merchants, craftsmen and workers), positioned at the bottom of the social order, benefited the most from the city&#x27;s rapid economic growth. They began to indulge in and patronize the entertainment of kabuki theatre, geisha, and courtesans of the pleasure districts. The term (&#x27;floating world&#x27;) came to describe this hedonistic lifestyle. Printed or painted ukiyo-e works were popular with the class, who had become wealthy enough to afford to decorate their homes with them.

The earliest ukiyo-e works emerged in the 1670s, with Hishikawa Moronobu&#x27;s paintings and monochromatic prints of beautiful women. Colour prints were introduced gradually, and at first were only used for special commissions. By the 1740s, artists such as Okumura Masanobu used multiple woodblocks to print areas of colour. In the 1760s, the success of Suzuki Harunobu&#x27;s &quot;brocade prints&quot; led to full-colour production becoming standard, with ten or more blocks used to create each print. Some ukiyo-e artists specialized in making paintings, but most works were prints. Artists rarely carved their own woodblocks for printing; rather, production was divided between the artist, who designed the prints; the carver, who cut the woodblocks; the printer, who inked and pressed the woodblocks onto handmade paper; and the publisher, who financed, promoted, and distributed the works. As printing was done by hand, printers were able to achieve effects impractical with machines, such as the blending or gradation of colours on the printing block.

Specialists have prized the portraits of beauties and actors by masters such as Torii Kiyonaga, Utamaro, and Sharaku that were created in the late 18th century. The 19th century also saw the continuation of masters of the ukiyo-e tradition, with the creation of Hokusai&#x27;s &quot;The Great Wave off Kanagawa&quot;, one of the most well-known works of Japanese art, and Hiroshige&#x27;s &quot;The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō&quot;. Following the deaths of these two masters, and against the technological and social modernization that followed the Meiji Restoration of 1868, ukiyo-e production went into steep decline.

However, in the 20th century there was a revival in Japanese printmaking: the (&#x27;new prints&#x27;) genre capitalized on Western interest in prints of traditional Japanese scenes, and the (&#x27;creative prints&#x27;) movement promoted individualist works designed, carved, and printed by a single artist. Prints since the late 20th century have continued in an individualist vein, often made with techniques imported from the West.

Ukiyo-e was central to forming the West&#x27;s perception of Japanese art in the late 19th century, particularly the landscapes of Hokusai and Hiroshige. From the 1870s onward, Japonisme became a prominent trend and had a strong influence on the early French Impressionists such as Edgar Degas, Édouard Manet and Claude Monet, as well as influencing Post-Impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh, and Art Nouveau artists such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.
==History==

===Pre-history===

Japanese art since the Heian period (794–1185) had followed two principal paths: the nativist tradition, focusing on Japanese themes, best known by the works of the Tosa school; and Chinese-inspired in a variety of styles, such as the monochromatic ink wash paintings of Sesshū Tōyō and his disciples. The Kanō school of painting incorporated features of both.

Since antiquity, Japanese art had found patrons in the aristocracy, military governments, and religious authorities. Until the 16th century, the lives of the common people had not been a main subject of painting, and even when they were included, the works were luxury items made for the ruling samurai and rich merchant classes. Later works appeared by and for townspeople, including inexpensive monochromatic paintings of female beauties and scenes of the theatre and pleasure districts. The hand-produced nature of these limited the scale of their production, a limit that was soon overcome by genres that turned to mass-produced woodblock printing.

During a prolonged period of civil war in the 16th century, a class of politically powerful merchants developed. These , the predecessors of the Edo period&#x27;s , allied themselves with the court and had power over local communities; their patronage of the arts encouraged a revival in the classical arts in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In the early 17th century, Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543–1616) unified the country and was appointed shōgun with supreme power over Japan. He consolidated his government in the village of Edo (modern Tokyo), and required the territorial lords to assemble there in alternate years with their entourages. The demands of the growing capital drew many male labourers from the country, so that males came to make up nearly seventy percent of the population. The village grew during the Edo period (1603–1867) from a population of 1800 to over a million in the 19th century.

The centralized shogunate put an end to the power of the and divided the population into four social classes, with the ruling samurai class at the top and the merchant class at the bottom. While deprived of their political influence, those of the merchant class most benefited from the rapidly expanding economy of the Edo period, and their improved lot allowed for leisure that many sought in the pleasure districts—in particular Yoshiwara in Edo—and collecting artworks to decorate their homes, which in earlier times had been well beyond their financial means. The experience of the pleasure quarters was open to those of sufficient wealth, manners, and education.

Woodblock printing in Japan traces back to the in 770 CE. Until the 17th century, such printing was reserved for Buddhist seals and images. Movable type appeared around 1600, but as the Japanese writing system required about 100,000 type pieces, hand-carving text onto woodblocks was more efficient. In , calligrapher Hon&#x27;ami Kōetsu and publisher combined printed text and images in an adaptation of &quot;The Tales of Ise&quot; (1608) and other works of literature. During the Kan&#x27;ei era (1624–1643) illustrated books of folk tales called (&#x27;orange-green books&#x27;) were the first books mass-produced using woodblock printing. Woodblock imagery continued to evolve as illustrations to the genre of tales of hedonistic urban life in the new capital. The rebuilding of Edo following the Great Fire of Meireki in 1657 occasioned a modernization of the city, and the publication of illustrated printed books flourished in the rapidly urbanizing environment.

The term , which can be translated as &#x27;floating world&#x27;, was homophonous with the ancient Buddhist term , meaning &#x27;this world of sorrow and grief&#x27;. The newer term at times was used to mean &#x27;erotic&#x27; or &#x27;stylish&#x27;, among other meanings, and came to describe the hedonistic spirit of the time for the lower classes. Asai Ryōi celebrated this spirit in the novel (&quot;Tales of the Floating World&quot;, ):

===Emergence of ukiyo-e (late 17th – early 18th centuries)===

The earliest ukiyo-e artists came from the world of Japanese painting. painting of the 17th century had developed a style of outlined forms which allowed inks to be dripped on a wet surface and spread out towards the outlines—this outlining of forms was to become the dominant style of ukiyo-e.

Around 1661, painted hanging scrolls known as &quot;Portraits of Kanbun Beauties&quot; gained popularity. The paintings of the Kanbun era (1661–1673), most of which are anonymous, marked the beginnings of ukiyo-e as an independent school. The paintings of Iwasa Matabei (1578–1650) have a great affinity with ukiyo-e paintings. Scholars disagree whether Matabei&#x27;s work itself is ukiyo-e; assertions that he was the genre&#x27;s founder are especially common amongst Japanese researchers. At times Matabei has been credited as the artist of the unsigned Hikone screen, a folding screen that may be one of the earliest surviving ukiyo-e works. The screen is in a refined Kanō style and depicts contemporary life, rather than the prescribed subjects of the painterly schools.

In response to the increasing demand for ukiyo-e works, Hishikawa Moronobu (1618–1694) produced the first ukiyo-e woodblock prints. By 1672, Moronobu&#x27;s success was such that he began to sign his work—the first of the book illustrators to do so. He was a prolific illustrator who worked in a wide variety of genres, and developed an influential style of portraying female beauties. Most significantly, he began to produce illustrations, not just for books, but as single-sheet images, which could stand alone or be used as part of a series. The Hishikawa school attracted a large number of followers, as well as imitators such as Sugimura Jihei, and signalled the beginning of the popularization of a new artform.

Torii Kiyonobu I and Kaigetsudō Ando became prominent emulators of Moronobu&#x27;s style following the master&#x27;s death, though neither was a member of the Hishikawa school. Both discarded background detail in favour of focus on the human figure—kabuki actors in the of Kiyonobu and the Torii school that followed him, and courtesans in the of Ando and his Kaigetsudō school. Ando and his followers produced a stereotyped female image whose design and pose lent itself to effective mass production, and its popularity created a demand for paintings that other artists and schools took advantage of. The Kaigetsudō school and its popular &quot;Kaigetsudō beauty&quot; ended after Ando&#x27;s exile over his role in the Ejima-Ikushima scandal of 1714.

Kyoto native Nishikawa Sukenobu (1671–1750) painted technically refined pictures of courtesans. Considered a master of erotic portraits, he was the subject of a government ban in 1722, though it is believed he continued to create works that circulated under different names. Sukenobu spent most of his career in Edo, and his influence was considerable in both the Kantō and Kansai regions. The paintings of Miyagawa Chōshun (1683–1752) portrayed early 18th-century life in delicate colours. Chōshun made no prints. The Miyagawa school he founded in the early-18th century specialized in romantic paintings in a style more refined in line and colour than the Kaigetsudō school. Chōshun allowed greater expressive freedom in his adherents, a group that later included Hokusai.

===Colour prints (mid-18th century)===

Even in the earliest monochromatic prints and books, colour was added by hand for special commissions. Demand for colour in the early-18th century was met with prints hand-tinted with orange and sometimes green or yellow. These were followed in the 1720s with a vogue for pink-tinted and later the lacquer-like ink of the . In 1744, the were the first successes in colour printing, using multiple woodblocks—one for each colour, the earliest pink and vegetable green.

A great self-promoter, Okumura Masanobu (1686–1764) played a major role during the period of rapid technical development in printing from the late 17th to mid-18th centuries. He established a shop in 1707 and combined elements of the leading contemporary schools in a wide array of genres, though Masanobu himself belonged to no school. Amongst the innovations in his romantic, lyrical images were the introduction of geometrical perspective in the genre in the 1740s; the long, narrow prints; and the combination of graphics and literature in prints that included self-penned haiku poetry.

Ukiyo-e reached a peak in the late 18th century with the advent of full-colour prints, developed after Edo returned to prosperity under Tanuma Okitsugu following a long depression. These popular colour prints came to be called , or &#x27;brocade pictures&#x27;, as their brilliant colours seemed to bear resemblance to imported Chinese Shuchiang brocades, known in Japanese as . The first to emerge were expensive calendar prints, printed with multiple blocks on very fine (or finer than standard) paper with heavy, opaque inks. These prints had the number of days for each month hidden in the design, and were sent at the New Year as personalized greetings, bearing the name of the patron rather than the artist. The blocks for these prints were later re-used for commercial production, obliterating the patron&#x27;s name and replacing it with that of the artist.

The delicate, romantic prints of Suzuki Harunobu (1725–1770) were amongst the first to realize expressive and complex colour designs, printed with up to a dozen separate blocks to handle the different colours and half-tones. His restrained, graceful prints invoked the classicism of poetry and painting. The prolific Harunobu was the dominant ukiyo-e artist of his time. The success of Harunobu&#x27;s colourful from 1765 on led to a steep decline in demand for the limited palettes of and , as well as hand-coloured prints.

A trend against the idealism of the prints of Harunobu and the Torii school grew following Harunobu&#x27;s death in 1770. Katsukawa Shunshō (1726–1793) and his school produced portraits of kabuki actors with greater fidelity to the actors&#x27; actual features than had been the trend. Sometime-collaborators Koryūsai (1735 – ) and Kitao Shigemasa (1739–1820) were prominent depicters of women who also moved ukiyo-e away from the dominance of Harunobu&#x27;s idealism by focusing on contemporary urban fashions and celebrated real-world courtesans and geisha. Koryūsai was perhaps the most prolific ukiyo-e artist of the 18th century, and produced a larger number of paintings and print series than any predecessor. The Kitao school that Shigemasa founded was one of the dominant schools of the closing decades of the 18th century.

In the 1770s, Utagawa Toyoharu produced a number of perspective prints that demonstrated a mastery of Western perspective techniques that had eluded his predecessors in the genre. Toyoharu&#x27;s works helped pioneer the landscape as an ukiyo-e subject, rather than merely a background for human figures. In the 19th century, Western-style perspective techniques were absorbed into Japanese artistic culture, and deployed in the refined landscapes of such artists as Hokusai and Hiroshige, the latter a member of the Utagawa school that Toyoharu founded. This school was to become one of the most influential, and produced works in a far greater variety of genres than any other school.

===Peak period (late 18th century)===

While the late 18th century saw hard economic times, ukiyo-e saw a peak in quantity and quality of works, particularly during the Kansei era (1789–1791). The ukiyo-e of the period of the Kansei Reforms brought about a focus on beauty and harmony that collapsed into decadence and disharmony in the next century as the reforms broke down and tensions rose, culminating in the Meiji Restoration of 1868.

Especially in the 1780s, Torii Kiyonaga (1752–1815) of the Torii school depicted traditional ukiyo-e subjects like beauties and urban scenes, which he printed on large sheets of paper, often as multiprint horizontal diptychs or triptychs. His works dispensed with the poetic dreamscapes made by Harunobu, opting instead for realistic depictions of idealized female forms dressed in the latest fashions and posed in scenic locations. He also produced portraits of kabuki actors in a realistic style that included accompanying musicians and chorus.

A law went into effect in 1790 requiring prints to bear a censor&#x27;s seal of approval to be sold. Censorship increased in strictness over the following decades, and violators could receive harsh punishments. From 1799 even preliminary drafts required approval. A group of Utagawa-school offenders including Toyokuni had their works repressed in 1801, and Utamaro was imprisoned in 1804 for making prints of 16th-century political and military leader Toyotomi Hideyoshi.

Utamaro (–1806) made his name in the 1790s with his (&#x27;large-headed pictures of beautiful women&#x27;) portraits, focusing on the head and upper torso, a style others had previously employed in portraits of kabuki actors. Utamaro experimented with line, colour, and printing techniques to bring out subtle differences in the features, expressions, and backdrops of subjects from a wide variety of class and background. Utamaro&#x27;s individuated beauties were in sharp contrast to the stereotyped, idealized images that had been the norm. By the end of the decade, especially following the death of his patron Tsutaya Jūzaburō in 1797, Utamaro&#x27;s prodigious output declined in quality, and he died in 1806.

Appearing suddenly in 1794 and disappearing just as suddenly ten months later, the prints of the enigmatic Sharaku are amongst ukiyo-e&#x27;s best known. Sharaku produced striking portraits of kabuki actors, introducing a greater level of realism into his prints that emphasized the differences between the actor and the portrayed character. The expressive, contorted faces he depicted contrasted sharply with the serene, mask-like faces more common to artists such as Harunobu or Utamaro. Published by Tsutaya, Sharaku&#x27;s work found resistance, and in 1795 his output ceased as mysteriously as it had appeared; his real identity is still unknown. Utagawa Toyokuni (1769–1825) produced kabuki portraits in a style Edo townsfolk found more accessible, emphasizing dramatic postures and avoiding Sharaku&#x27;s realism.

A consistent high level of quality marks ukiyo-e of the late 18th-century, but the works of Utamaro and Sharaku often overshadow those other masters of the era. One of Kiyonaga&#x27;s followers, Eishi (1756–1829), abandoned his position as painter for shōgun Tokugawa Ieharu to take up ukiyo-e design. He brought a refined sense to his portraits of graceful, slender courtesans, and left behind a number of noted students. With a fine line, Eishōsai Chōki ( 1786–1808) designed portraits of delicate courtesans. The Utagawa school came to dominate ukiyo-e output in the late Edo period.

Edo was the primary centre of ukiyo-e production throughout the Edo period. Another major centre developed in the Kamigata region of areas in and around Kyoto and Osaka. In contrast to the range of subjects in the Edo prints, those of Kamigata tended to be portraits of kabuki actors. The style of the Kamigata prints was little distinguished from those of Edo until the late 18th century, partly because artists often moved back and forth between the two areas. Colours tend to be softer and pigments thicker in Kamigata prints than in those of Edo. In the 19th century, many of the prints were designed by kabuki fans and other amateurs.


===Late flowering: flora, fauna, and landscapes (19th century)===

The Tenpō Reforms of 1841–1843 sought to suppress outward displays of luxury, including the depiction of courtesans and actors. As a result, many ukiyo-e artists designed travel scenes and pictures of nature, especially birds and flowers. Landscapes had been given limited attention since Moronobu, and they formed an important element in the works of Kiyonaga and Shunchō. It was not until late in the Edo period that landscape came into its own as a genre, especially via the works of Hokusai and Hiroshige The landscape genre has come to dominate Western perceptions of ukiyo-e, though ukiyo-e had a long history preceding these late-era masters. The Japanese landscape differed from the Western tradition in that it relied more heavily on imagination, composition, and atmosphere than on strict observance of nature.

The self-proclaimed &quot;mad painter&quot; Hokusai (1760–1849) enjoyed a long, varied career. His work is marked by a lack of the sentimentality common to ukiyo-e, and a focus on formalism influenced by Western art. Among his accomplishments are his illustrations of Takizawa Bakin&#x27;s novel &quot;&quot;, his series of sketchbooks, the &quot;Hokusai Manga&quot;, and his popularization of the landscape genre with &quot;Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji&quot;, which includes his best-known print, &quot;The Great Wave off Kanagawa&quot;, one of the most famous works of Japanese art. In contrast to the work of the older masters, Hokusai&#x27;s colours were bold, flat, and abstract, and his subject was not the pleasure districts but the lives and environment of the common people at work. Established masters Eisen, Kuniyoshi, and Kunisada also followed Hokusai&#x27;s steps into landscape prints in the 1830s, producing prints with bold compositions and striking effects.

Though not often given the attention of their better-known forebears, the Utagawa school produced a few masters in this declining period. The prolific Kunisada (1786–1865) had few rivals in the tradition of making portrait prints of courtesans and actors. One of those rivals was Eisen (1790–1848), who was also adept at landscapes. Perhaps the last significant member of this late period, Kuniyoshi (1797–1861) tried his hand at a variety of themes and styles, much as Hokusai had. His historical scenes of warriors in violent combat were popular, especially his series of heroes from the (1827–1830) and (1847). He was adept at landscapes and satirical scenes—the latter an area rarely explored in the dictatorial atmosphere of the Edo period; that Kuniyoshia could dare tackle such subjects was a sign of the weakening of the shogunate at the time.

Hiroshige (1797–1858) is considered Hokusai&#x27;s greatest rival in stature. He specialized in pictures of birds and flowers, and serene landscapes, and is best known for his travel series, such as &quot;The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō&quot; and &quot;The Sixty-nine Stations of the Kisokaidō&quot;, the latter a cooperative effort with Eisen. His work was more realistic, subtly coloured, and atmospheric than Hokusai&#x27;s; nature and the seasons were key elements: mist, rain, snow, and moonlight were prominent parts of his compositions. Hiroshige&#x27;s followers, including adopted son Hiroshige II and son-in-law Hiroshige III, carried on their master&#x27;s style of landscapes into the Meiji era.


===Decline (late 19th century)===

Following the deaths of Hokusai and Hiroshige and the Meiji Restoration of 1868, ukiyo-e suffered a sharp decline in quantity and quality. The rapid Westernization of the Meiji period that followed saw woodblock printing turn its services to journalism, and face competition from photography. Practitioners of pure ukiyo-e became more rare, and tastes turned away from a genre seen as a remnant of an obsolescent era. Artists continued to produce occasional notable works, but by the 1890s the tradition was moribund.

Synthetic pigments imported from Germany began to replace traditional organic ones in the mid-19th century. Many prints from this era made extensive use of a bright red, and were called (&#x27;red pictures&#x27;). Artists such as Yoshitoshi (1839–1892) led a trend in the 1860s of gruesome scenes of murders and ghosts, monsters and supernatural beings, and legendary Japanese and Chinese heroes. His &quot;One Hundred Aspects of the Moon&quot; (1885–1892) depicts a variety of fantastic and mundane themes with a moon motif. Kiyochika (1847–1915) is known for his prints documenting the rapid modernization of Tokyo, such as the introduction of railways, and his depictions of Japan&#x27;s wars with China and with Russia. Earlier a painter of the Kanō school, in the 1870s Chikanobu (1838–1912) turned to prints, particularly of the imperial family and scenes of Western influence on Japanese life in the Meiji period.


===Introduction to the West===

Aside from Dutch traders, who had had trading relations dating to the beginning of the Edo period, Westerners paid little notice to Japanese art before the mid-19th century, and when they did they rarely distinguished it from other art from the East. Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg spent a year in the Dutch trading settlement Dejima, near Nagasaki, and was one of the earliest Westerners to collect Japanese prints. The export of ukiyo-e thereafter slowly grew, and at the beginning of the 19th century Dutch merchant-trader Isaac Titsingh&#x27;s collection drew the attention of connoisseurs of art in Paris.

The arrival in Edo of American Commodore Matthew Perry in 1853 led to the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854, which opened Japan to the outside world after over two centuries of seclusion. Ukiyo-e prints were amongst the items he brought back to the United States. Such prints had appeared in Paris from at least the 1830s, and by the 1850s were numerous; reception was mixed, and even when praised ukiyo-e was generally thought inferior to Western works which emphasized mastery of naturalistic perspective and anatomy. Japanese art drew notice at the International Exhibition of 1867 in Paris, and became fashionable in France and England in the 1870s and 1880s. The prints of Hokusai and Hiroshige played a prominent role in shaping Western perceptions of Japanese art. At the time of their introduction to the West, woodblock printing was the most common mass medium in Japan, and the Japanese considered it of little lasting value.

Early Europeans promoters and scholars of ukiyo-e and Japanese art included writer Edmond de Goncourt and art critic Philippe Burty, who coined the term &quot;Japonism&quot;. Stores selling Japanese goods opened, including those of Édouard Desoye in 1862 and art dealer Siegfried Bing in 1875. From 1888 to 1891 Bing published the magazine &quot;Artistic Japan&quot; in English, French, and German editions, and curated an ukiyo-e exhibition at the in 1890 attended by artists such as Mary Cassatt.

American Ernest Fenollosa was the earliest Western devotee of Japanese culture, and did much to promote Japanese art—Hokusai&#x27;s works featured prominently at his inaugural exhibition as first curator of Japanese art Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and in Tokyo in 1898 he curated the first ukiyo-e exhibition in Japan. By the end of the 19th century, the popularity of ukiyo-e in the West drove prices beyond the means of most collectors—some, such as Degas, traded their own paintings for such prints. Tadamasa Hayashi was a prominent Paris-based dealer of respected tastes whose Tokyo office was responsible for evaluating and exporting large quantities of ukiyo-e prints to the West in such quantities that Japanese critics later accused him of siphoning Japan of its national treasure. The drain first went unnoticed in Japan, as Japanese artists were immersing themselves in the classical painting techniques of the West.

Japanese art, and particularly ukiyo-e prints, came to influence Western art from the time of the early Impressionists. Early painter-collectors incorporated Japanese themes and compositional techniques into their works as early as the 1860s: the patterned wallpapers and rugs in Manet&#x27;s paintings were inspired by the patterned kimono found in ukiyo-e pictures, and Whistler focused his attention on ephemeral elements of nature as in ukiyo-e landscapes. Van Gogh was an avid collector, and painted copies in oil of prints by Hiroshige and Eisen. Degas and Cassatt depicted fleeting, everyday moments in Japanese-influenced compositions and perspectives. ukiyo-e&#x27;s flat perspective and unmodulated colours were a particular influence on graphic designers and poster makers. Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s lithographs displayed his interest not only in ukiyo-e&#x27;s flat colours and outlined forms, but also in their subject matter: performers and prostitutes. He signed much of this work with his initials in a circle, imitating the seals on Japanese prints. Other artists of the time who drew influence from ukiyo-e include Monet, La Farge, Gauguin, and Les Nabis members such as Bonnard and Vuillard. French composer Claude Debussy drew inspiration for his music from the prints of Hokusai and Hiroshige, most prominently in (1905). Imagist poets such as Amy Lowell and Ezra Pound found inspiration in ukiyo-e prints; Lowell published a book of poetry called &quot;Pictures of the Floating World&quot; (1919) on oriental themes or in an oriental style.

===Descendant traditions (20th century)===
The travel sketchbook became a popular genre beginning about 1905, as the Meiji government promoted travel within Japan to have citizens better know their country. In 1915, publisher Shōzaburō Watanabe introduced the term (&quot;new prints&quot;) to describe a style of prints he published that featured traditional Japanese subject matter and were aimed at foreign and upscale Japanese audiences. Prominent artists included Goyō Hashiguchi, called the &quot;Utamaro of the Taishō period&quot; for his manner of depicting women; Shinsui Itō, who brought more modern sensibilities to images of women; and Hasui Kawase, who made modern landscapes. Watanabe also published works by non-Japanese artists, an early success of which was a set of Indian- and Japanese-themed prints in 1916 by the English Charles W. Bartlett (1860–1940). Other publishers followed Watanabe&#x27;s success, and some artists such as Goyō and Hiroshi Yoshida set up studios to publish their own work.

Artists of the (&#x27;creative prints&#x27;) movement took control of every aspect of the printmaking process—design, carving, and printing were by the same pair of hands. Kanae Yamamoto (1882–1946), then a student at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, is credited with the birth of this approach. In 1904, he produced &quot;Fisherman&quot; using woodblock printing, a technique until then frowned upon by the Japanese art establishment as old-fashioned and for its association with commercial mass production. The foundation of the Japanese Woodcut Artists&#x27; Association in 1918 marks the beginning of this approach as a movement. The movement favoured individuality in its artists, and as such has no dominant themes or styles. Works ranged from the entirely abstract ones of Kōshirō Onchi (1891–1955) to the traditional figurative depictions of Japanese scenes of Un&#x27;ichi Hiratsuka (1895–1997). These artists produced prints not because they hoped to reach a mass audience, but as a creative end in itself, and did not restrict their print media to the woodblock of traditional ukiyo-e.

Prints from the late-20th and 21st centuries have evolved from the concerns of earlier movements, especially the movement&#x27;s emphasis on individual expression. Screen printing, etching, mezzotint, mixed media, and other Western methods have joined traditional woodcutting amongst printmakers&#x27; techniques.


==Style==


Early ukiyo-e artists brought with them a sophisticated knowledge of and training in the composition principles of classical Chinese painting; gradually these artists shed the overt Chinese influence to develop a native Japanese idiom. The early ukiyo-e artists have been called &quot;Primitives&quot; in the sense that the print medium was a new challenge to which they adapted these centuries-old techniques—their image designs are not considered &quot;primitive&quot;. Many ukiyo-e artists received training from teachers of the Kanō and other painterly schools.

A defining feature of most ukiyo-e prints is a well-defined, bold, flat line. The earliest prints were monochromatic, and these lines were the only printed element; even with the advent of colour this characteristic line continued to dominate. In ukiyo-e composition forms are arranged in flat spaces with figures typically in a single plane of depth. Attention was drawn to vertical and horizontal relationships, as well as details such as lines, shapes, and patterns such as those on clothing. Compositions were often asymmetrical, and the viewpoint was often from unusual angles, such as from above. Elements of images were often cropped, giving the composition a spontaneous feel. In colour prints, contours of most colour areas are sharply defined, usually by the linework. The aesthetic of flat areas of colour contrasts with the modulated colours expected in Western traditions and with other prominent contemporary traditions in Japanese art patronized by the upper class, such as in the subtle monochrome ink brushstrokes of zenga brush painting or tonal colours of the Kanō school of painting.

The colourful, ostentatious, and complex patterns, concern with changing fashions, and tense, dynamic poses and compositions in ukiyo-e are in striking contrast with many concepts in traditional Japanese aesthetics. Prominent amongst these, favours simplicity, asymmetry, and imperfection, with evidence of the passage of time; and values subtlety, humility, and restraint. Ukiyo-e can be less at odds with aesthetic concepts such as the racy, urbane stylishness of .

Ukiyo-e displays an unusual approach to graphical perspective, one that can appear underdeveloped when compared to European paintings of the same period. Western-style geometrical perspective was known in Japan—practised most prominently by the Akita ranga painters of the 1770s—as were Chinese methods to create a sense of depth using a homogeny of parallel lines. The techniques sometimes appeared together in ukiyo-e works, geometrical perspective providing an illusion of depth in the background and the more expressive Chinese perspective in the fore. The techniques were most likely learned at first through Chinese Western-style paintings rather than directly from Western works. Long after becoming familiar with these techniques, artists continued to harmonize them with traditional methods according to their compositional and expressive needs. Other ways of indicating depth included the Chinese tripartite composition method used in Buddhist pictures, where a large form is placed in the foreground, a smaller in the midground, and yet a smaller in the background; this can be seen in Hokusai&#x27;s &quot;Great Wave&quot;, with a large boat in the foreground, a smaller behind it, and a small Mt Fuji behind them.

There was a tendency since early ukiyo-e to pose beauties in what art historian called a &quot;serpentine posture&quot;, which involves the subjects&#x27; bodies twisting unnaturally while facing behind themselves. Art historian posited that this had its roots in traditional dance; countered that the poses were artistic licence taken by ukiyo-e artists, causing a seemingly relaxed pose to reach unnatural or impossible physical extremes. This remained the case even when realistic perspective techniques were applied to other sections of the composition.

===Themes and genres===
Typical subjects were female beauties (&quot;), kabuki actors (&quot;), and landscapes. The women depicted were most often courtesans and geisha at leisure, and promoted the entertainments to be found in the pleasure districts. The detail with which artists depicted courtesans&#x27; fashions and hairstyles allows the prints to be dated with some reliability. Less attention was given to accuracy of the women&#x27;s physical features, which followed the day&#x27;s pictorial fashions—the faces stereotyped, the bodies tall and lanky in one generation and petite in another. Portraits of celebrities were much in demand, in particular those from the kabuki and sumo worlds, two of the most popular entertainments of the era. While the landscape has come to define ukiyo-e for many Westerners, landscapes flourished relatively late in the ukiyo-e&#x27;s history.

Ukiyo-e prints grew out of book illustration—many of Moronobu&#x27;s earliest single-page prints were originally pages from books he had illustrated. books of illustrations were popular and continued be an important outlet for ukiyo-e artists. In the late period, Hokusai produced the three-volume &quot;One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji&quot; and the 15-volume &quot;Hokusai Manga&quot;, the latter a compendium of over 4000 sketches of a wide variety of realistic and fantastic subjects.

Traditional Japanese religions do not consider sex or pornography a moral corruption in the sense of most Abrahamic faiths, and until the changing morals of the Meiji era led to its suppression, shunga erotic prints were a major genre. While the Tokugawa regime subjected Japan to strict censorship laws, pornography was not considered an important offence and generally met with the censors&#x27; approval. Many of these prints displayed a high level a draughtsmanship, and often humour, in their explicit depictions of bedroom scenes, voyeurs, and oversized anatomy. As with depictions of courtesans, these images were closely tied to entertainments of the pleasure quarters. Nearly every ukiyo-e master produced shunga at some point. Records of societal acceptance of shunga are absent, though Timon Screech posits that there were almost certainly some concerns over the matter, and that its level of acceptability has been exaggerated by later collectors, especially in the West.

Scenes from nature have been an important part of Asian art throughout history. Artists have closely studied the correct forms and anatomy of plants and animals, even though depictions of human anatomy remained more fanciful until modern times. Ukiyo-e nature prints are called , which translates as &quot;flower-and-bird pictures&quot;, though the genre was open to more than just flowers or birds, and the flowers and birds did not necessarily appear together. Hokusai&#x27;s detailed, precise nature prints are credited with establishing as a genre.

The Tenpō Reforms of the 1840s suppressed the depiction of actors and courtesans. Aside from landscapes and , artists turned to depictions of historical scenes, such as of ancient warriors or of scenes from legend, literature, and religion. The 11th century &quot;Tale of Genji&quot; and the 13th-century &quot;Tale of the Heike&quot; have been sources of artistic inspiration throughout Japanese history, including in ukiyo-e. Well-known warriors and swordsmen such as Miyamoto Musashi (1584–1645) were frequent subjects, as were depictions of monsters, the supernatural, and heroes of Japanese and Chinese mythology.

From the 17th to 19th centuries, Japan isolated itself from the rest of the world. Trade, primarily with the Dutch and Chinese, was restricted to the island of Dejima near Nagasaki. Outlandish pictures called were sold to tourists of the foreigners and their wares. In the mid-19th century, Yokohama became the primary foreign settlement after 1859, from which Western knowledge proliferated in Japan. Especially from 1858 to 1862, prints documented, with various levels of fact and fancy, the growing community of world denizens with whom the Japanese were now coming in contact; triptychs of scenes of Westerners and their technology were particularly popular.

Specialized prints included , deluxe, limited-edition prints aimed at connoisseurs, of which a five-line poem was usually part of the design; and printed hand fans, which often suffer from having been handled.

==Production==

===Paintings===
Ukiyo-e artists often made both prints and paintings; some specialized in one or the other. In contrast with previous traditions, ukiyo-e painters favoured bright, sharp colours, and often delineated contours with ink, an effect similar to the linework in prints. Unrestricted by the technical limitations of printing, a wider range of techniques, pigments, and surfaces were available to the painter. Artists painted with pigments made from mineral or organic substances, such as safflower, ground shells, lead, and cinnabar, and later synthetic dyes imported from the West such as Paris green and Prussian blue. Silk or paper hanging scrolls, handscrolls, or folding screens were the most common surfaces.

===Print production===

Ukiyo-e prints were the works of teams of artisans in several workshops; it was rare for designers to cut their own woodblocks. Labour was divided into four groups: the publisher, who commissioned, promoted, and distributed the prints; the artists, who provided the design image; the woodcarvers, who prepared the woodblocks for printing; and the printers, who made impressions of the woodblocks on paper. Normally only the names of the artist and publisher were credited on the finished print.

Ukiyo-e prints were impressed on hand-made paper manually, rather than by mechanical press as in the West. The artist provided an ink drawing on thin paper, which was pasted to a block of cherry wood and rubbed with oil until the upper layers of paper could be pulled away, leaving a translucent layer of paper that the block-cutter could use as a guide. The block-cutter cut away the non-black areas of the image, leaving raised areas that were inked to leave an impression. The original drawing was destroyed in the process.

Prints were made with blocks face up so the printer could vary pressure for different effects, and watch as paper absorbed the water-based ink, applied quickly in even horizontal strokes. Amongst the printer&#x27;s tricks were embossing of the image, achieved by pressing an uninked woodblock on the paper to achieve effects, such as the textures of clothing patterns or fishing net. Other effects included burnishing rubbing the paper with agate to brighten colours; varnishing; overprinting; dusting with metal or mica; and sprays to imitate falling snow.

The ukiyo-e print was a commercial art form, and the publisher played an important role. Publishing was highly competitive; over a thousand publishers are known from throughout the period. The number peaked at around 250 in the 1840s and 1850s—200 in Edo alone—and slowly shrank following the opening of Japan until about 40 remained at the opening of the 20th century. The publishers owned the woodblocks and copyrights, and from the late 18th century enforced copyrights through the Picture Book and Print Publishers Guild. Prints that went through several pressings were particularly profitable, as the publisher could reuse the woodblocks without further payment to the artist or woodblock cutter. The woodblocks were also traded or sold to other publishers or pawnshops. Publishers were usually also vendors, and commonly sold each other&#x27;s wares in their shops. In addition to the artist&#x27;s seal, publishers marked the prints with their own seals—some a simple logo, others quite elaborate, incorporating an address or other information.

Print designers went through apprenticeship before being granted the right to produce prints of their own that they could sign with their own names. Young designers could be expected to cover part or all of the costs of cutting the woodblocks. As the artists gained fame, publishers usually covered these costs, and artists could demand higher fees.

In pre-modern Japan, people could go by numerous names throughout their lives, their childhood personal name different from their name as an adult. An artist&#x27;s name consisted of a —an artist surname—followed by an personal art name. The was most frequently taken from the school the artist belonged to, such as Utagawa or Torii, and the normally took a Chinese character from the master&#x27;s art name—for example, many students of Toyokuni () took the from his name, including Kunisada () and Kuniyoshi (). The names artists signed to their works can be a source of confusion as they sometimes changed names through their careers; Hokusai was an extreme case, using over a hundred names throughout his 70-year career.

The prints were mass-marketed, and by the mid-19th century, the total circulation of a print could run into the thousands. Retailers and travelling sellers promoted them at prices affordable to prosperous townspeople. In some cases, the prints advertised kimono designs by the print artist. From the second half of the 17th century, prints were frequently marketed as part of a series, each print stamped with the series name and the print&#x27;s number in that series. This proved a successful marketing technique, as collectors bought each new print in the series to keep their collections complete. By the 19th century, series such as Hiroshige&#x27;s &quot;Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō&quot; ran to dozens of prints.


====Colour print production====

While colour printing in Japan dates to the 1640s, early ukiyo-e prints used only black ink. Colour was sometimes added by hand, using a red lead ink in prints, or later in a pink safflower ink in prints. Colour printing arrived in books in the 1720s and in single-sheet prints in the 1740s, with a different block and printing for each colour. Early colours were limited to pink and green; techniques expanded over the following two decades to allow up to five colours. The mid-1760s brought full-colour prints made from ten or more woodblocks. To keep the blocks for each colour aligned correctly, registration marks called were placed on one corner and an adjacent side.

Printers first used natural colour dyes made from mineral or vegetable sources. The dyes had a translucent quality that allowed a variety of colours to be mixed from primary red, blue, and yellow pigments. In the 18th century, Prussian blue became popular, and was particularly prominent in the landscapes of Hokusai and Hiroshige, as was , where the printer produced gradations of colour or blended one colour into another. Cheaper and more consistent synthetic aniline dyes arrived from the West in 1864. The colours were harsher and brighter than traditional pigments. The Meiji government promoted their use as part of broader policies of Westernization.

==Criticism and historiography==

Contemporary records of ukiyo-e artists are rare. The most significant is the (&quot;Various Thoughts on ukiyo-e&quot;), a collection of commentaries and artist biographies. Ōta Nanpo compiled the first, no-longer-extant version around 1790. The work did not see print during the Edo era, but circulated in hand-copied editions that were subject to numerous additions and alterations; over 120 variants of the are known.

Before World War II, the predominant view of ukiyo-e stressed the centrality of prints; this viewpoint ascribes ukiyo-e&#x27;s founding to Moronobu. Following the war, thinking turned to the importance of ukiyo-e painting and making direct connections with 17th century paintings; this viewpoint sees Matabei as the genre&#x27;s originator, and is especially favoured in Japan. This view had become widespread among Japanese researchers by the 1930s, but the militaristic government of the time suppressed it, wanting to emphasize a division between the scroll paintings associated with the court, and the prints associated with the sometimes anti-authoritarian merchant class.

The earliest comprehensive historical and critical works on ukiyo-e came from the West. Ernest Fenollosa was Professor of Philosophy at the Imperial University in Tokyo from 1878, and was Commissioner of Fine Arts to the Japanese government from 1886. His &quot;Masters of &quot; of 1896 was the first comprehensive overview and set the stage for most later works with an approach to the history in terms of epochs: beginning with Matabei in a primitive age, it evolved towards a late-18th century golden age that began to decline with the advent of Utamaro, and had a brief revival with Hokusai and Hiroshige&#x27;s landscapes in the 1830s. Laurence Binyon, the Keeper of Oriental Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, wrote an account in &quot;Painting in the Far East&quot; in 1908 that was similar to Fenollosa&#x27;s, but placed Utamaro and Sharaku amongst the masters. Arthur Davison Ficke built on the works of Fenollosa and Binyon with a more comprehensive &quot;Chats on Japanese Prints&quot; in 1915. James A. Michener&#x27;s &quot;The Floating World&quot; in 1954 broadly followed the chronologies of the earlier works, while dropping classifications into periods and recognizing the earlier artists not as primitives but as accomplished masters emerging from earlier painting traditions. For Michener and his sometime collaborator Richard Lane, ukiyo-e began with Moronobu rather than Matabei. Lane&#x27;s &quot;Masters of the Japanese Print&quot; of 1962 maintained the approach of period divisions while placing ukiyo-e firmly within the genealogy of Japanese art. The book acknowledges artists such as Yoshitoshi and Kiyochika as late masters.

&#x27;s &quot;Traditional Woodblock Prints of Japan&quot; of 1964 placed ukiyo-e artists in three periods: the first was a primitive period that included Harunobu, followed by a golden age of Kiyonaga, Utamaro, and Sharaku, and then a closing period of decline following the declaration beginning in the 1790s of strict sumptuary laws that dictated what could be depicted in artworks. The book nevertheless recognizes a larger number of masters from throughout this last period than earlier works had, and viewed ukiyo-e painting as a revival of painting. further refined Takahashi&#x27;s analysis by identifying the decline as coinciding with the desperate attempts of the shogunate to hold on to power through the passing of draconian laws as its hold on the country continued to break down, culminating in the Meiji Restoration in 1868.

Ukiyo-e scholarship has tended to focus on the cataloguing of artists, an approach that lacks the rigour and originality that has come to be applied to art analysis in other areas. Such catalogues are numerous, but tend overwhelmingly to concentrate on a group of recognized geniuses. Little original research has been added to the early, foundational evaluations of ukiyo-e and its artists, especially with regard to relatively minor artists. While the commercial nature of ukiyo-e has always been acknowledged, evaluation of artists and their works has rested on the aesthetic preferences of connoisseurs and paid little heed to contemporary commercial success.

Standards for inclusion in the ukiyo-e canon rapidly evolved in the early literature. Utamaro was particularly contentious, seen by Fenollosa and others as a degenerate symbol of ukiyo-e&#x27;s decline; Utamaro has since gained general acceptance as one of the form&#x27;s greatest masters. Artists of the 19th century such as Yoshitoshi were ignored or marginalized, attracting scholarly attention only towards the end of the 20th century. Works on late-era Utagawa artists such as Kunisada and Kuniyoshi have revived some of the contemporary esteem these artists enjoyed. Many late works examine the social or other conditions behind the art, and are unconcerned with valuations that would place it in a period of decline.

Novelist Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki was critical of the superior attitude of Westerners who claimed a higher aestheticism in purporting to have discovered ukiyo-e. He maintained that ukiyo-e was merely the easiest form of Japanese art to understand from the perspective of Westerners&#x27; values, and that Japanese of all social strata enjoyed ukiyo-e, but that Confucian morals of the time kept them from freely discussing it, social mores that were violated by the West&#x27;s flaunting of the discovery.

Since the dawn of the 20th century historians of manga—Japanese comics and cartooning—have developed narratives connecting the art form to pre-20th century Japanese art. Particular emphasis falls on the &quot;Hokusai Manga&quot; as a precursor, though Hokusai&#x27;s book is not narrative, nor does the term &quot;manga&quot; originate with Hokusai. In English and other languages, the word &quot;manga&quot; is used in the restrictive sense of &quot;Japanese comics&quot; or &quot;Japanese-style comics&quot;, while in Japanese it indicates all forms of comics, cartooning, and caricature.

==Collection and preservation==

The ruling classes strictly limited the space permitted for the homes of the lower social classes; the relatively small size of ukiyo-e works was ideal for hanging in these homes. Little record of the patrons of ukiyo-e paintings has survived. They sold for considerably higher prices than prints—up to many thousands of times more, and thus must have been purchased by the wealthy, likely merchants and perhaps some from the samurai class. Late-era prints are the most numerous extant examples, as they were produced in the greatest quantities in the 19th century, and the older a print is the less chance it had of surviving. Ukiyo-e was largely associated with Edo, and visitors to Edo often bought what they called as souvenirs. Shops that sold them might specialize in products such as hand-held fans, or offer a diverse selection.

The ukiyo-e print market was highly diversified as it sold to a heterogeneous public, from dayworkers to wealthy merchants. Little concrete information is known about production and consumption habits. Detailed records in Edo were kept of a wide variety of courtesans, actors, and sumo wrestlers, but no such records pertaining to ukiyo-e remain—or perhaps ever existed. Determining what is understood about the demographics of ukiyo-e consumption has required indirect means.

Determining at what prices prints sold is a challenge for experts, as records of hard figures are scanty and there was great variety in the production quality, size, supply and demand, and methods, which went through changes such as the introduction of full-colour printing. How expensive prices can be considered is also difficult to determine as social and economic conditions were in flux throughout the period. In the 19th century, records survive of prints selling from as low as 16 to 100 for deluxe editions. Jun&#x27;ichi Ōkubo suggests that prices in the 1920s and 1930s of were likely common for standard prints. As a loose comparison, a bowl of soba noodles in the early 19th century typically sold for 16 .


The dyes in ukiyo-e prints are susceptible to fading when exposed even to low levels of light; this makes long-term display undesirable. The paper they are printed on deteriorates when it comes in contact with acidic materials, so storage boxes, folders, and mounts must be of neutral pH or alkaline. Prints should be regularly inspected for problems needing treatment, and stored at a relative humidity of 70% or less to prevent fungal discolourations.

The paper and pigments in ukiyo-e paintings are sensitive to light and seasonal changes in humidity. Mounts must be flexible, as the sheets can tear under sharp changes in humidity. In the Edo era, the sheets were mounted on long-fibred paper and preserved scrolled up in plain paulownia wood boxes placed in another lacquer wooden box. In museum settings, display times are heavily limited to prevent deterioration from exposure to light and environmental pollution, and care is taken in the unrolling and rerolling of scrolls, with scrolling causing concavities in the paper, and the unrolling and rerolling of the scrolls causing creasing. The humidity levels that scrolls are kept in are generally between 50 percent and 60 percent, as scrolls kept in too dry an atmosphere become brittle.

Because ukiyo-e prints were mass-produced, collecting them presents considerations different from the collecting of paintings. There is wide variation in the condition, rarity, cost, and quality of extant prints. Prints may have stains, foxing, wormholes, tears, creases, or dogmarks, the colours may have faded, or they may have been retouched. Carvers may have altered the colours or composition of prints that went through multiple editions. When cut after printing, the paper may have been trimmed within the margin. Values of prints depend on a variety of factors, including the artist&#x27;s reputation, print condition, rarity, and whether it is an original pressing—even high-quality later printings will fetch a fraction of the valuation of an original.

Ukiyo-e prints often went through multiple editions, sometimes with changes made to the blocks in later editions. Editions made from recut woodblocks also circulate, such as legitimate later reproductions, as well as pirate editions and other fakes. Takamizawa Enji (1870–1927), a producer of ukiyo-e reproductions, developed a method of recutting woodblocks to print fresh colour on faded originals, over which he used tobacco ash to make the fresh ink seem aged. These refreshed prints he resold as original printings. Amongst the defrauded collectors was American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who brought Takamizawa prints with him from Japan to the US, some of which he had sold before the truth was discovered.

Ukiyo-e artists are referred to in the Japanese style, the surname preceding the personal name, and well-known artists such as Utamaro and Hokusai by personal name alone. Dealers normally refer to ukiyo-e prints by the names of the standard sizes, most commonly the , the , and the —precise sizes vary, and paper was often trimmed after printing.


Many of the largest high-quality collections of ukiyo-e lie outside Japan. Examples entered the collection of the National Library of France in the first half of the 19th century. The British Museum began a collection in 1860 that by the late 20th century numbered items. The largest, surpassing items, resides in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, begun when Ernest Fenollosa donated his collection in 1912. The first exhibition in Japan of ukiyo-e prints was likely one presented by Kōjirō Matsukata in 1925, who amassed his collection in Paris during World War I and later donated it to the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo. The largest collection of ukiyo-e in Japan is the pieces in the Japan Ukiyo-e Museum in the city of Matsumoto.
