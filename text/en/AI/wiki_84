<text>Laurence Kerr Olivier, Baron Olivier ( ; 22 May 1907 – 11 July 1989) was an English actor and director. He and his contemporaries Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud made up a trio of male actors who dominated the British stage of the mid-20th century. He also worked in films throughout his career, playing more than fifty cinema roles. Late in his career he had considerable success in television roles.

Olivier&#x27;s family had no theatrical connections, but his father, a clergyman, decided that his son should become an actor. After attending a drama school in London, Olivier learned his craft in a succession of acting jobs during the late 1920s. In 1930 he had his first important West End success in Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Private Lives&quot;, and he appeared in his first film. In 1935 he played in a celebrated production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; alongside Gielgud and Peggy Ashcroft, and by the end of the decade he was an established star. In the 1940s, together with Richardson and John Burrell, Olivier was the co-director of the Old Vic, building it into a highly respected company. There his most celebrated roles included Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot; and Sophocles&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus&quot;.

In the 1950s Olivier was an independent actor-manager, but his stage career was in the doldrums until he joined the &quot;avant-garde&quot; English Stage Company in 1957 to play the title role in &quot;The Entertainer&quot;, a part he later played on film. From 1963 to 1973 he was the founding director of Britain&#x27;s National Theatre, running a resident company that fostered many future stars. His own parts there included the title role in &quot;Othello&quot; (1965), and Shylock in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (1970).

Among Olivier&#x27;s films are &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1939), &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1940) and a trilogy of Shakespeare films as actor/director: &quot;Henry V&quot; (1944), &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1948) and &quot;Richard III&quot; (1955). His later films included &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960), &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; (1968), &quot;Sleuth&quot; (1972), &quot;Marathon Man&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; (1978). His television appearances included an adaptation of &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot; (1960), &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; (1973), &quot;Love Among the Ruins&quot; (1975), &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1976), &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; (1981) and &quot;King Lear&quot; (1983).

Olivier&#x27;s honours included a knighthood (1947), a life peerage (1970) and the Order of Merit (1981). For his on-screen work he received an Academy Award, five British Academy Film Awards, five Emmy Awards and four Golden Globe Awards in addition to nominations for a Tony Award, two British Academy Television Awards and a Grammy Award. Olivier was awardered with two non-competitive Academy Honorary Awards in 1947 and 1979, Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1983 and BAFTA Fellowship in 1976. The National Theatre&#x27;s largest auditorium is named in his honour, and he is commemorated in the Laurence Olivier Awards, given annually by the Society of London Theatre. He was married three times, to the actresses Jill Esmond from 1930 to 1940, Vivien Leigh from 1940 to 1960, and Joan Plowright from 1961 until his death.

==Life and career==
===1907–1924: Early life and education===

Olivier was born in Dorking, Surrey, the youngest of the three children of the Reverend Gerard Kerr Olivier and Agnes Louise (&quot;née&quot; Crookenden). He had two older siblings: Sybille and Gerard Dacres &quot;Dickie&quot;. His great-great-grandfather was of French Huguenot descent, and Olivier came from a long line of Protestant clergymen. Gerard Olivier had begun a career as a schoolmaster, but in his thirties he discovered a strong religious vocation and was ordained as a priest of the Church of England. He belonged to the high church, ritualist wing of Anglicanism and was known as &quot;Father Olivier&quot;. Some Anglican congregations did not like this style, and the only church posts he was offered were temporary, usually deputising for regular incumbents in their absence. This meant a nomadic existence, and for Laurence&#x27;s first few years, he never lived in one place long enough to make friends.

In 1912, when Olivier was five, his father secured a permanent appointment as assistant rector at St Saviour&#x27;s, Pimlico. He held the post for six years, and a stable family life was at last possible. Olivier was devoted to his mother, but not to his father, whom he found a cold and remote parent, though he learned a great deal of the art of performing from him. As a young man Gerard Olivier had considered a stage career and was a dramatic and effective preacher. Olivier wrote that his father knew &quot;when to drop the voice, when to bellow about the perils of hellfire, when to slip in a gag, when suddenly to wax sentimental ... The quick changes of mood and manner absorbed me, and I have never forgotten them.&quot;
In 1916, after attending a series of preparatory schools, Olivier passed the singing examination for admission to the choir school of All Saints, Margaret Street, in central London. His elder brother was already a pupil and Olivier gradually settled in, though he felt himself to be something of an outsider. The church&#x27;s style of worship was (and remains) Anglo-Catholic, with emphasis on ritual, vestments and incense. The theatricality of the services appealed to Olivier, and the vicar encouraged the students to develop a taste for secular as well as religious drama. In a school production of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; in 1917, the ten-year-old Olivier&#x27;s performance as Brutus impressed an audience that included Lady Tree, the young Sybil Thorndike and Ellen Terry, who wrote in her diary, &quot;The small boy who played Brutus is already a great actor.&quot; He later won praise in other schoolboy productions, as Maria in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (1918) and Katherine in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; (1922).

From All Saints, Olivier went on to St Edward&#x27;s School, Oxford, from 1921 to 1924. He made little mark until his final year, when he played Puck in the school&#x27;s production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;; his performance was a tour de force that won him popularity among his fellow pupils. In January 1924, his brother left England to work in India as a rubber planter. Olivier missed him greatly and asked his father how soon he could follow. He recalled in his memoirs that his father replied, &quot;Don&#x27;t be such a fool, you&#x27;re not going to India, you&#x27;re going on the stage.&quot;

===1924–1929: Early acting career===
In 1924 Gerard Olivier, a habitually frugal man, told his son that he must gain not only admission to the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, but also a scholarship with a bursary to cover his tuition fees and living expenses. Olivier&#x27;s sister had been a student there and was a favourite of Elsie Fogerty, the founder and principal of the school. Olivier later speculated that it was on the strength of this connection that Fogerty agreed to award him the bursary.

One of Olivier&#x27;s contemporaries at the school was Peggy Ashcroft, who observed he was &quot;rather uncouth in that his sleeves were too short and his hair stood on end but he was intensely lively and great fun&quot;. By his own admission he was not a very conscientious student, but Fogerty liked him and later said that he and Ashcroft stood out among her many pupils.

After leaving the Central School in 1925, Olivier worked for small theatrical companies; his first stage appearance was in a sketch called &quot;The Unfailing Instinct&quot; at the Brighton Hippodrome in August 1925. Later that year, he was taken on by Sybil Thorndike (the daughter of a friend of Olivier&#x27;s father) and her husband Lewis Casson as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company. Olivier modelled his performing style on that of Gerald du Maurier, of whom he said, &quot;He seemed to mutter on stage but had such perfect technique. When I started I was so busy doing a du Maurier that no one ever heard a word I said. The Shakespearean actors one saw were terrible hams like Frank Benson.&quot; Olivier&#x27;s concern with speaking naturally and avoiding what he called &quot;singing&quot; Shakespeare&#x27;s verse was the cause of much frustration in his early career, as critics regularly decried his delivery.

In 1926, on Thorndike&#x27;s recommendation, Olivier joined the Birmingham Repertory Company. His biographer Michael Billington describes the Birmingham company as &quot;Olivier&#x27;s university&quot;, where in his second year he was given the chance to play a wide range of important roles, including Tony Lumpkin in &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot;, the title role in &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, and Parolles in &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;. Billington adds that the engagement led to &quot;a lifelong friendship with his fellow actor Ralph Richardson that was to have a decisive effect on the British theatre.&quot;

While playing the juvenile lead in &quot;Bird in Hand&quot; at the Royalty Theatre in June 1928, Olivier began a relationship with Jill Esmond, the daughter of the actors Henry V. Esmond and Eva Moore. Olivier later recounted that he thought &quot;she would most certainly do excellent well for a wife ... I wasn&#x27;t likely to do any better at my age and with my undistinguished track-record, so I promptly fell in love with her.&quot;

In 1928 Olivier created the role of Stanhope in R. C. Sherriff&#x27;s &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, in which he scored a great success at its single Sunday night premiere. He was offered the part in the West End production the following year, but turned it down in favour of the more glamorous role of Beau Geste in a stage adaptation of P. C. Wren&#x27;s 1929 novel of the same name. &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; became a long-running success; &quot;Beau Geste&quot; failed. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; commented, &quot;Mr. Laurence Olivier did his best as Beau, but he deserves and will get better parts. Mr. Olivier is going to make a big name for himself&quot;. For the rest of 1929 Olivier appeared in seven plays, all of which were short-lived. Billington ascribes this failure rate to poor choices by Olivier rather than mere bad luck.

===1930–1935: Rising star===
In 1930, with his impending marriage in mind, Olivier earned some extra money with small roles in two films. In April he travelled to Berlin to film the English-language version of &quot;The Temporary Widow&quot;, a crime comedy with Lilian Harvey, and in May he spent four nights working on another comedy, &quot;Too Many Crooks&quot;. During work on the latter film, for which he was paid £60 (), he met Laurence Evans, who became his personal manager. Olivier did not enjoy working in film, which he dismissed as &quot;this anaemic little medium which could not stand great acting&quot;, but financially it was much more rewarding than his theatre work.

Olivier and Esmond married on 25 July 1930 at All Saints, Margaret Street, although within weeks both realised they had erred. Olivier later recorded that the marriage was &quot;a pretty crass mistake. I insisted on getting married from a pathetic mixture of religious and animal promptings. ... She had admitted to me that she was in love elsewhere and could never love me as completely as I would wish.&quot; Olivier later recounted that following the wedding he did not keep a diary for ten years and never followed religious practices again, although he considered those facts to be &quot;mere coincidence&quot;, unconnected to the nuptials.

In 1930 Noël Coward cast Olivier as Victor Prynne in his new play &quot;Private Lives&quot;, which opened at the new Phoenix Theatre in London in September. Coward and Gertrude Lawrence played the lead roles, Elyot Chase and Amanda Prynne. Victor is a secondary character, along with Sybil Chase; the author called them &quot;extra puppets, lightly wooden ninepins, only to be repeatedly knocked down and stood up again&quot;. To make them credible spouses for Amanda and Elyot, Coward was determined that two outstandingly attractive performers should play the parts. Olivier played Victor in the West End and then on Broadway; Adrianne Allen was Sybil in London, but could not go to New York, where the part was taken by Esmond. In addition to giving the 23-year-old Olivier his first successful West End role, Coward became something of a mentor. In the late 1960s Olivier told Sheridan Morley:

In 1931 RKO Pictures offered Olivier a two-film contract at $1,000 a week (); he discussed the possibility with Coward, who, irked, told Olivier &quot;You&#x27;ve no artistic integrity, that&#x27;s your trouble; this is how you cheapen yourself.&quot; He accepted and moved to Hollywood, despite some misgivings. His first film was the drama &quot;Friends and Lovers&quot;, in a supporting role, before RKO loaned him to Fox Studios for his first film lead, a British journalist in a Russia under martial law in &quot;The Yellow Ticket&quot;, alongside Elissa Landi and Lionel Barrymore. The cultural historian Jeffrey Richards describes Olivier&#x27;s look as an attempt by Fox Studios to produce a likeness of Ronald Colman, and Colman&#x27;s moustache, voice and manner are &quot;perfectly reproduced&quot;. Olivier returned to RKO to complete his contract with the 1932 drama &quot;Westward Passage&quot;, which was a commercial failure. Olivier&#x27;s initial foray into American films had not provided the breakthrough he hoped for; disillusioned with Hollywood, he returned to London, where he appeared in two British films, &quot;Perfect Understanding&quot; with Gloria Swanson and &quot;No Funny Business&quot;—in which Esmond also appeared. He was tempted back to Hollywood in 1933 to appear opposite Greta Garbo in &quot;Queen Christina&quot;, but was replaced after two weeks of filming because of a lack of chemistry between the two.

Olivier&#x27;s stage roles in 1934 included Bothwell in Gordon Daviot&#x27;s &quot;Queen of Scots&quot;, which was only a moderate success for him and for the play, but led to an important engagement for the same management (Bronson Albery) shortly afterwards. In the interim he had a great success playing a thinly disguised version of the American actor John Barrymore in George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber&#x27;s &quot;Theatre Royal&quot;. His success was vitiated by his breaking an ankle two months into the run, in one of the athletic, acrobatic stunts with which he liked to enliven his performances.
In 1935, under Albery&#x27;s management, John Gielgud staged &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at the New Theatre, co-starring with Peggy Ashcroft, Edith Evans and Olivier. Gielgud had seen Olivier in &quot;Queen of Scots&quot;, spotted his potential, and gave him a major step up in his career. For the first weeks of the run Gielgud played Mercutio and Olivier played Romeo, after which they exchanged roles. The production broke all box-office records for the play, running for 189 performances. Olivier was enraged at the notices after the first night, which praised the virility of his performance but fiercely criticised his speaking of Shakespeare&#x27;s verse, contrasting it with his co-star&#x27;s mastery of the poetry. The friendship between the two men was prickly, on Olivier&#x27;s side, for the rest of his life.

===1936–1938: Old Vic and Vivien Leigh===
In May 1936 Olivier and Richardson jointly directed and starred in a new piece by J. B. Priestley, &quot;Bees on the Boatdeck&quot;. Both actors won excellent notices, but the play, an allegory of Britain&#x27;s decay, did not attract the public and closed after four weeks. Later in the same year Olivier accepted an invitation to join the Old Vic company. The theatre, in an unfashionable location south of the Thames, had offered inexpensive tickets for opera and drama under its proprietor Lilian Baylis since 1912. Her drama company specialised in the plays of Shakespeare, and many leading actors had taken very large cuts in their pay to develop their Shakespearean techniques there. Gielgud had been in the company from 1929 to 1931 and Richardson from 1930 to 1932. Among the actors whom Olivier joined in late 1936 were Edith Evans, Ruth Gordon, Alec Guinness and Michael Redgrave. In January 1937 Olivier took the title role in an uncut version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; in which once again his delivery of the verse was unfavourably compared with that of Gielgud, who had played the role on the same stage seven years previously to enormous acclaim. &quot;The Observer&quot;″s Ivor Brown praised Olivier&#x27;s &quot;magnetism and muscularity&quot; but missed &quot;the kind of pathos so richly established by Mr Gielgud&quot;. The reviewer in &quot;The Times&quot; found the performance &quot;full of vitality&quot;, but at times &quot;too light ... the character slips from Mr Olivier&#x27;s grasp&quot;.
After &quot;Hamlet&quot;, the company presented &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; in what the director, Tyrone Guthrie, summed up as &quot;a baddish, immature production of mine, with Olivier outrageously amusing as Sir Toby and a very young Alec Guinness outrageous and more amusing as Sir Andrew&quot;. &quot;Henry V&quot; was the next play, presented in May to mark the Coronation of George VI. A pacifist, as he then was, Olivier was as reluctant to play the warrior king as Guthrie was to direct the piece, but the production was a success and Baylis had to extend the run from four to eight weeks.

Following Olivier&#x27;s success in Shakespearean stage productions, he made his first foray into Shakespeare on film in 1936, as Orlando in &quot;As You Like It&quot;, directed by Paul Czinner, &quot;a charming if lightweight production&quot;, according to Michael Brooke of the British Film Institute&#x27;s (BFI&#x27;s) Screenonline. The following year Olivier appeared alongside Vivien Leigh in the historical drama &quot;Fire Over England&quot;. He had first met Leigh briefly at the Savoy Grill and then again when she visited him during the run of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, probably early in 1936, and the two had begun an affair sometime that year. Of the relationship, Olivier later said that &quot;I couldn&#x27;t help myself with Vivien. No man could. I hated myself for cheating on Jill, but then I had cheated before, but this was something different. This wasn&#x27;t just out of lust. This was love that I really didn&#x27;t ask for but was drawn into.&quot; While his relationship with Leigh continued he conducted an affair with the actress Ann Todd, and possibly had a brief affair with the actor Henry Ainley, according to the biographer Michael Munn.

In June 1937 the Old Vic company took up an invitation to perform &quot;Hamlet&quot; in the courtyard of the castle at Elsinore, where Shakespeare located the play. Olivier secured the casting of Leigh to replace Cherry Cottrell as Ophelia. Because of torrential rain the performance had to be moved from the castle courtyard to the ballroom of a local hotel, but the tradition of playing Hamlet at Elsinore was established, and Olivier was followed by, among others, Gielgud (1939), Redgrave (1950), Richard Burton (1954), Christopher Plummer (1964), Derek Jacobi (1979), Kenneth Branagh (1988) and Jude Law (2009). Back in London, the company staged &quot;Macbeth&quot;, with Olivier in the title role. The stylised production by Michel Saint-Denis was not well liked, but Olivier had some good notices among the bad. On returning from Denmark, Olivier and Leigh told their respective spouses about the affair and that their marriages were over; Esmond moved out of the marital house and in with her mother. After Olivier and Leigh made a tour of Europe in mid-1937 they returned to separate film projects—&quot;A Yank at Oxford&quot; for her and &quot;The Divorce of Lady X&quot; for him—and moved into a property together in Iver, Buckinghamshire.

Olivier returned to the Old Vic for a second season in 1938. For &quot;Othello&quot; he played Iago, with Richardson in the title role. Guthrie wanted to experiment with the theory that Iago&#x27;s villainy is driven by a suppressed love for Othello. Olivier was willing to co-operate, but Richardson was not; audiences and most critics failed to spot the supposed motivation of Olivier&#x27;s Iago, and Richardson&#x27;s Othello seemed underpowered. After that comparative failure, the company had a success with &quot;Coriolanus&quot; starring Olivier in the title role. The notices were laudatory, mentioning him alongside great predecessors such as Edmund Kean, William Macready and Henry Irving. The actor Robert Speaight described it as &quot;Olivier&#x27;s first incontestably great performance&quot;. This was Olivier&#x27;s last appearance on a London stage for six years.

===1938–1944: Hollywood and war years===

In 1938 Olivier joined Richardson to film the spy thriller &quot;Q Planes&quot;, released the following year. Frank Nugent, the critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, thought Olivier was &quot;not quite so good&quot; as Richardson, but was &quot;quite acceptable&quot;. In late 1938, lured by a salary of $50,000 (), the actor travelled to Hollywood to take the part of Heathcliff in the 1939 film &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, alongside Merle Oberon and David Niven. In less than a month Leigh had joined him, explaining that her trip was &quot;partially because Larry&#x27;s there and partially because I intend to get the part of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara&quot;—the role in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; in which she was eventually cast. Olivier did not enjoy making &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, and his approach to film acting, combined with a dislike for Oberon, led to tensions on set. The director, William Wyler, was a hard taskmaster, and Olivier learned to remove what Billington described as &quot;the carapace of theatricality&quot; to which he was prone, replacing it with &quot;a palpable reality&quot;. The resulting film was a commercial and critical success that earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor and created his screen reputation. Caroline Lejeune, writing for &quot;The Observer&quot;, considered that &quot;Olivier&#x27;s dark, moody face, abrupt style, and a certain fine arrogance towards the world in his playing are just right&quot; in the role, while the reviewer for &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that Olivier &quot;is a good embodiment of Heathcliff ... impressive enough on a more human plane, speaking his lines with real distinction, and always both romantic and alive.&quot;
After returning to London briefly in mid-1939, the couple returned to America, Leigh to film the final takes for &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, and Olivier to prepare for filming of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rebecca&quot;—although the couple had hoped to appear in it together. Instead, Joan Fontaine was selected for the role of Mrs de Winter, as the producer David O. Selznick thought that not only was she more suitable for the role, but that it was best to keep Olivier and Leigh apart until their divorces came through. Olivier followed &quot;Rebecca&quot; with &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, in the role of Mr. Darcy. To his disappointment Elizabeth Bennet was played by Greer Garson rather than Leigh. He received good reviews for both films and showed a more confident screen presence than he had in his early work. In January 1940 Olivier and Esmond were granted their divorce. In February, following another request from Leigh, her husband also applied for their marriage to be terminated.

On stage, Olivier and Leigh starred in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; on Broadway. It was an extravagant production, but a commercial failure. In &quot;The New York Times&quot; Brooks Atkinson praised the scenery but not the acting: &quot;Although Miss Leigh and Mr Olivier are handsome young people they hardly act their parts at all.&quot; The couple had invested almost all their savings in the project, and its failure was a grave financial blow. They were married in August 1940, at the San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara.

The war in Europe had been under way for a year and was going badly for Britain. After his wedding Olivier wanted to help the war effort. He telephoned Duff Cooper, the Minister of Information under Winston Churchill, hoping to get a position in Cooper&#x27;s department. Cooper advised him to remain where he was and speak to the film director Alexander Korda, who was based in the US at Churchill&#x27;s behest, with connections to British Intelligence. Korda—with Churchill&#x27;s support and involvement—directed &quot;That Hamilton Woman&quot;, with Olivier as Horatio Nelson and Leigh in the title role. Korda saw that the relationship between the couple was strained. Olivier was tiring of Leigh&#x27;s suffocating adulation, and she was drinking to excess. The film, in which the threat of Napoleon paralleled that of Hitler, was seen by critics as &quot;bad history but good British propaganda&quot;, according to the BFI.

Olivier&#x27;s life was under threat from the Nazis and pro-German sympathisers. The studio owners were concerned enough that Samuel Goldwyn and Cecil B. DeMille both provided support and security to ensure his safety. On the completion of filming, Olivier and Leigh returned to Britain. He had spent the previous year learning to fly and had completed nearly 250 hours by the time he left America. He intended to join the Royal Air Force but instead made another propaganda film, &quot;49th Parallel&quot;, narrated short pieces for the Ministry of Information, and joined the Fleet Air Arm because Richardson was already in the service. Richardson had gained a reputation for crashing aircraft, which Olivier rapidly eclipsed. Olivier and Leigh settled in a cottage just outside RNAS Worthy Down, where he was stationed with a training squadron; Noël Coward visited the couple and thought Olivier looked unhappy. Olivier spent much of his time taking part in broadcasts and making speeches to build morale, and in 1942 he was invited to make another propaganda film, &quot;The Demi-Paradise&quot;, in which he played a Soviet engineer who helps improve British-Russian relationships.
In 1943, at the behest of the Ministry of Information, Olivier began working on &quot;Henry V&quot;. Originally he had no intention of taking the directorial duties, but ended up directing and producing, in addition to taking the title role. He was assisted by an Italian internee, Filippo Del Giudice, who had been released to produce propaganda for the Allied cause. The decision was made to film the battle scenes in neutral Ireland, where it was easier to find the 650 extras. John Betjeman, the press attaché at the British embassy in Dublin, played a key liaison role with the Irish government in making suitable arrangements. The film was released in November 1944. Brooke, writing for the BFI, considers that it &quot;came too late in the Second World War to be a call to arms as such, but formed a powerful reminder of what Britain was defending.&quot; The music for the film was written by William Walton, &quot;a score that ranks with the best in film music&quot;, according to the music critic Michael Kennedy. Walton also provided the music for Olivier&#x27;s next two Shakespearean adaptations, &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1948) and &quot;Richard III&quot; (1955). &quot;Henry V&quot; was warmly received by critics. The reviewer for &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; wrote that the film combined &quot;new art hand-in-hand with old genius, and both superbly of one mind&quot;, in a film that worked &quot;triumphantly&quot;. The critic for &quot;The Times&quot; considered that Olivier &quot;plays Henry on a high, heroic note and never is there danger of a crack&quot;, in a film described as &quot;a triumph of film craft&quot;. There were Oscar nominations for the film, including Best Picture and Best Actor, but it won none and Olivier was instead presented with a &quot;Special Award&quot;. He was unimpressed, and later commented that &quot;this was my first absolute fob-off, and I regarded it as such.&quot;

===1944–1948: Co-directing the Old Vic===
Throughout the war Tyrone Guthrie had striven to keep the Old Vic company going, even after German bombing in 1942 left the theatre a near-ruin. A small troupe toured the provinces, with Sybil Thorndike at its head. By 1944, with the tide of the war turning, Guthrie felt it time to re-establish the company in a London base and invited Richardson to head it. Richardson made it a condition of accepting that he should share the acting and management in a triumvirate. Initially he proposed Gielgud and Olivier as his colleagues, but the former declined, saying, &quot;It would be a disaster, you would have to spend your whole time as referee between Larry and me.&quot; It was finally agreed that the third member would be the stage director John Burrell. The Old Vic governors approached the Royal Navy to secure the release of Richardson and Olivier; the Sea Lords consented, with, as Olivier put it, &quot;a speediness and lack of reluctance which was positively hurtful.&quot;
The triumvirate secured the New Theatre for their first season and recruited a company. Thorndike was joined by, among others, Harcourt Williams, Joyce Redman and Margaret Leighton. It was agreed to open with a repertory of four plays: &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;, &quot;Richard III&quot; and &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;. Olivier&#x27;s roles were the Button Moulder, Sergius, Richard and Astrov; Richardson played Peer, Bluntschli, Richmond and Vanya. The first three productions met with acclaim from reviewers and audiences; &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; had a mixed reception, although &quot;The Times&quot; thought Olivier&#x27;s Astrov &quot;a most distinguished portrait&quot; and Richardson&#x27;s Vanya &quot;the perfect compound of absurdity and pathos&quot;. In &quot;Richard III&quot;, according to Billington, Olivier&#x27;s triumph was absolute: &quot;so much so that it became his most frequently imitated performance and one whose supremacy went unchallenged until Antony Sher played the role forty years later&quot;. In 1945 the company toured Germany, where they were seen by many thousands of Allied servicemen; they also appeared at the Comédie-Française theatre in Paris, the first foreign company to be given that honour. The critic Harold Hobson wrote that Richardson and Olivier quickly &quot;made the Old Vic the most famous theatre in the Anglo-Saxon world.&quot;

The second season, in 1945, featured two double bills. The first consisted of &quot;Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2&quot;. Olivier played the warrior Hotspur in the first and the doddering Justice Shallow in the second. He received good notices, but by general consent the production belonged to Richardson as Falstaff. In the second double bill it was Olivier who dominated, in the title roles of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; and &quot;The Critic&quot;. In the two one-act plays his switch from searing tragedy and horror in the first half to farcical comedy in the second impressed most critics and audience members, though a minority felt that the transformation from Sophocles&#x27;s bloodily blinded hero to Sheridan&#x27;s vain and ludicrous Mr Puff &quot;smacked of a quick-change turn in a music hall&quot;. After the London season the company played both the double bills and &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; in a six-week run on Broadway.

The third, and final, London season under the triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson took the title role in &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;. Olivier would have preferred the roles to be reversed, but Richardson did not wish to attempt Lear. Olivier&#x27;s Lear received good but not outstanding reviews. In his scenes of decline and madness towards the end of the play some critics found him less moving than his finest predecessors in the role. The influential critic James Agate suggested that Olivier used his dazzling stage technique to disguise a lack of feeling, a charge that the actor strongly rejected, but which was often made throughout his later career. During the run of &quot;Cyrano&quot;, Richardson was knighted, to Olivier&#x27;s undisguised envy. The younger man received the accolade six months later, by which time the days of the triumvirate were numbered. The high profile of the two star actors did not endear them to the new chairman of the Old Vic governors, Lord Esher. He had ambitions to be the first head of the National Theatre and had no intention of letting actors run it. He was encouraged by Guthrie, who, having instigated the appointment of Richardson and Olivier, had come to resent their knighthoods and international fame.

In January 1947 Olivier began working on his second film as a director, &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1948), in which he also took the lead role. The original play was heavily cut to focus on the relationships, rather than the political intrigue. The film became a critical and commercial success in Britain and abroad, although Lejeune, in &quot;The Observer&quot;, considered it &quot;less effective than [Olivier&#x27;s] stage work. ... He speaks the lines nobly, and with the caress of one who loves them, but he nullifies his own thesis by never, for a moment, leaving the impression of a man who cannot make up his own mind; here, you feel rather, is an actor-producer-director who, in every circumstance, knows exactly what he wants, and gets it&quot;. Campbell Dixon, the critic for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; thought the film &quot;brilliant ... one of the masterpieces of the stage has been made into one of the greatest of films.&quot; &quot;Hamlet&quot; became the first non-American film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, while Olivier won the Award for Best Actor.

In 1948 Olivier led the Old Vic company on a six-month tour of Australia and New Zealand. He played Richard III, Sir Peter Teazle in Sheridan&#x27;s&quot; The School for Scandal&quot; and Antrobus in Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;, appearing alongside Leigh in the latter two plays. While Olivier was on the Australian tour and Richardson was in Hollywood, Esher terminated the contracts of the three directors, who were said to have &quot;resigned&quot;. Melvyn Bragg in a 1984 study of Olivier, and John Miller in the authorised biography of Richardson, both comment that Esher&#x27;s action put back the establishment of a National Theatre for at least a decade. Looking back in 1971, Bernard Levin wrote that the Old Vic company of 1944 to 1948 &quot;was probably the most illustrious that has ever been assembled in this country&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; said that the triumvirate&#x27;s years were the greatest in the Old Vic&#x27;s history; as &quot;The Guardian&quot; put it, &quot;the governors summarily sacked them in the interests of a more mediocre company spirit&quot;.

===1948–1951: Post-war work===

By the end of the Australian tour, both Leigh and Olivier were exhausted and ill, and he told a journalist, &quot;You may not know it, but you are talking to a couple of walking corpses.&quot; Later he would comment that he &quot;lost Vivien&quot; in Australia, a reference to Leigh&#x27;s affair with the Australian actor Peter Finch, whom the couple met during the tour. Shortly afterwards Finch moved to London, where Olivier auditioned him and put him under a long-term contract with Laurence Olivier Productions. Finch and Leigh&#x27;s affair continued on and off for several years.

Although it was common knowledge that the Old Vic triumvirate had been dismissed, they refused to be drawn on the matter in public, and Olivier even arranged to play a final London season with the company in 1949, as Richard III, Sir Peter Teazle, and Chorus in his own production of Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Antigone&quot; with Leigh in the title role. After that, he was free to embark on a new career as an actor-manager. In partnership with Binkie Beaumont he staged the English premiere of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, with Leigh in the central role of Blanche DuBois. The play was condemned by most critics, but the production was a considerable commercial success, and led to Leigh&#x27;s casting as Blanche in the 1951 film version. Gielgud, who was a devoted friend of Leigh&#x27;s, doubted whether Olivier was wise to let her play the demanding role of the mentally unstable heroine: &quot;[Blanche] was so very like her, in a way. It must have been a most dreadful strain to do it night after night. She would be shaking and white and quite distraught at the end of it.&quot;
The production company set up by Olivier took a lease on the St James&#x27;s Theatre. In January 1950 he produced, directed and starred in Christopher Fry&#x27;s verse play &quot;Venus Observed&quot;. The production was popular, despite poor reviews, but the expensive production did little to help the finances of Laurence Olivier Productions. After a series of box-office failures, the company balanced its books in 1951 with productions of Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; which the Oliviers played in London and then took to Broadway. Olivier was thought by some critics to be under par in both his roles, and some suspected him of playing deliberately below his usual strength so that Leigh might appear his equal. Olivier dismissed the suggestion, regarding it as an insult to his integrity as an actor. In the view of the critic and biographer W. A. Darlington, he was simply miscast both as Caesar and Antony, finding the former boring and the latter weak. Darlington comments, &quot;Olivier, in his middle forties when he should have been displaying his powers at their very peak, seemed to have lost interest in his own acting&quot;. Over the next four years Olivier spent much of his time working as a producer, presenting plays rather than directing or acting in them. His presentations at the St James&#x27;s included seasons by Ruggero Ruggeri&#x27;s company giving two Pirandello plays in Italian, followed by a visit from the Comédie-Française playing works by Molière, Racine, Marivaux and Musset in French. Darlington considers a 1951 production of &quot;Othello&quot; starring Orson Welles as the pick of Olivier&#x27;s productions at the theatre.

===1951–1954: Independent work===
While Leigh made &quot;Streetcar&quot; in 1951, Olivier joined her in Hollywood to film &quot;Carrie&quot;, based on the controversial novel &quot;Sister Carrie&quot;; although the film was plagued by troubles, Olivier received warm reviews and a BAFTA nomination. Olivier began to notice a change in Leigh&#x27;s behaviour, and he later recounted that &quot;I would find Vivien sitting on the corner of the bed, wringing her hands and sobbing, in a state of grave distress; I would naturally try desperately to give her some comfort, but for some time she would be inconsolable.&quot; After a holiday with Coward in Jamaica, she seemed to have recovered, but Olivier later recorded, &quot;I am sure that ... [the doctors] must have taken some pains to tell me what was wrong with my wife; that her disease was called manic depression and what that meant—a possibly permanent cyclical to-and-fro between the depths of depression and wild, uncontrollable mania. He also recounted the years of problems he had experienced because of Leigh&#x27;s illness, writing, &quot;throughout her possession by that uncannily evil monster, manic depression, with its deadly ever-tightening spirals, she retained her own individual canniness—an ability to disguise her true mental condition from almost all except me, for whom she could hardly be expected to take the trouble.&quot;

In January 1953 Leigh travelled to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to film &quot;Elephant Walk&quot; with Peter Finch. Shortly after filming started she suffered a breakdown, and returned to Britain where, between periods of incoherence, she told Olivier that she was in love with Finch, and had been having an affair with him; she gradually recovered over a period of several months. As a result of the breakdown, many of the Oliviers&#x27; friends learned of her problems. Niven said she had been &quot;quite, quite mad&quot;, and in his diary, Coward expressed the view that &quot;things had been bad and getting worse since 1948 or thereabouts.&quot;

For the Coronation season of 1953, Olivier and Leigh starred in the West End in Terence Rattigan&#x27;s Ruritanian comedy, &quot;The Sleeping Prince&quot;. It ran for eight months but was widely regarded as a minor contribution to the season, in which other productions included Gielgud in &quot;Venice Preserv&#x27;d&quot;, Coward in &quot;The Apple Cart&quot; and Ashcroft and Redgrave in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;.

Olivier directed his third Shakespeare film in September 1954, &quot;Richard III&quot; (1955), which he co-produced with Korda. The presence of four theatrical knights in the one film—Olivier was joined by Cedric Hardwicke, Gielgud and Richardson—led an American reviewer to dub it &quot;An-All-Sir-Cast&quot;. The critic for &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; described the film as a &quot;bold and successful achievement&quot;, but it was not a box-office success, which accounted for Olivier&#x27;s subsequent failure to raise the funds for a planned film of &quot;Macbeth&quot;. He won a BAFTA award for the role and was nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award, which Yul Brynner won.

===1955–1956: Last productions with Leigh===
In 1955 Olivier and Leigh were invited to play leading roles in three plays at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford. They began with &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, directed by Gielgud, with Olivier as Malvolio and Leigh as Viola. Rehearsals were difficult, with Olivier determined to play his conception of the role despite the director&#x27;s view that it was vulgar. Gielgud later commented:

The next production was &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Reviewers were lukewarm about the direction by Glen Byam Shaw and the designs by Roger Furse, but Olivier&#x27;s performance in the title role attracted superlatives. To J. C. Trewin, Olivier&#x27;s was &quot;the finest Macbeth of our day&quot;; to Darlington it was &quot;the best Macbeth of our time&quot;. Leigh&#x27;s Lady Macbeth received mixed but generally polite notices, although to the end of his life Olivier believed it to have been the best Lady Macbeth he ever saw.
In their third production of the 1955 Stratford season, Olivier played the title role in &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, with Leigh as Lavinia. Her notices in the part were damning, but the production by Peter Brook and Olivier&#x27;s performance as Titus received the greatest ovation in Stratford history from the first-night audience, and the critics hailed the production as a landmark in post-war British theatre. Olivier and Brook revived the production for a continental tour in June 1957; its final performance, which closed the old Stoll Theatre in London, was the last time Leigh and Olivier acted together.

Leigh became pregnant in 1956 and withdrew from the production of Coward&#x27;s comedy &quot;South Sea Bubble&quot;. The day after her final performance in the play she miscarried and entered a period of depression that lasted for months. In the same year Olivier directed and co-starred with Marilyn Monroe in a film version of &quot;The Sleeping Prince&quot;, retitled &quot;The Prince and the Showgirl&quot;. Although the filming was challenging because of Monroe&#x27;s behaviour, the film was appreciated by the critics.

===1957–1963: Royal Court and Chichester===
During the production of &quot;The Prince and the Showgirl&quot;, Olivier, Monroe and her husband, the American playwright Arthur Miller, went to see the English Stage Company&#x27;s production of John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; at the Royal Court. Olivier had seen the play earlier in the run and disliked it, but Miller was convinced that Osborne had talent, and Olivier reconsidered. He was ready for a change of direction; in 1981 he wrote:


Osborne was already at work on a new play, &quot;The Entertainer&quot;, an allegory of Britain&#x27;s post-colonial decline, centred on a seedy variety comedian, Archie Rice. Having read the first act—all that was completed by then—Olivier asked to be cast in the part. He had for years maintained that he might easily have been a third-rate comedian called &quot;Larry Oliver&quot;, and would sometimes play the character at parties. Behind Archie&#x27;s brazen façade there is a deep desolation, and Olivier caught both aspects, switching, in the words of the biographer Anthony Holden, &quot;from a gleefully tacky comic routine to moments of the most wrenching pathos&quot;. Tony Richardson&#x27;s production for the English Stage Company transferred from the Royal Court to the Palace Theatre in September 1957; after that it toured and returned to the Palace. The role of Archie&#x27;s daughter Jean was taken by three actresses during the various runs. The second of them was Joan Plowright, with whom Olivier began a relationship that endured for the rest of his life. Olivier said that playing Archie &quot;made me feel like a modern actor again&quot;. In finding an &quot;avant-garde&quot; play that suited him, he was, as Osborne remarked, far ahead of Gielgud and Ralph Richardson, who did not successfully follow his lead for more than a decade. Their first substantial successes in works by any of Osborne&#x27;s generation were Alan Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Forty Years On&quot; (Gielgud in 1968) and David Storey&#x27;s &quot;Home&quot; (Richardson and Gielgud in 1970).

Olivier received another BAFTA nomination for his supporting role in 1959&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot;. The same year, after a gap of two decades, Olivier returned to the role of Coriolanus, in a Stratford production directed by the 28-year-old Peter Hall. Olivier&#x27;s performance received strong praise from the critics for its fierce athleticism combined with an emotional vulnerability. In 1960 he made his second appearance for the Royal Court company in Ionesco&#x27;s absurdist play &quot;Rhinoceros&quot;. The production was chiefly remarkable for the star&#x27;s quarrels with the director, Orson Welles, who according to the biographer Francis Beckett suffered the &quot;appalling treatment&quot; that Olivier had inflicted on Gielgud at Stratford five years earlier. Olivier again ignored his director and undermined his authority. In 1960 and 1961 Olivier appeared in Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Becket&quot; on Broadway, first in the title role, with Anthony Quinn as the king, and later exchanging roles with his co-star.
Two films featuring Olivier were released in 1960. The first—filmed in 1959—was &quot;Spartacus&quot;, in which he portrayed the Roman general, Marcus Licinius Crassus. His second was &quot;The Entertainer&quot;, shot while he was appearing in &quot;Coriolanus&quot;; the film was well received by the critics, but not as warmly as the stage show had been. The reviewer for &quot;The Guardian&quot; thought the performances were good, and wrote that Olivier &quot;on the screen as on the stage, achieves the tour de force of bringing Archie Rice ... to life&quot;. For his performance, Olivier was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. He also made an adaptation of &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot; in 1960, winning an Emmy Award.

The Oliviers&#x27; marriage was disintegrating during the late 1950s. While directing Charlton Heston in the 1960 play &quot;The Tumbler&quot;, Olivier divulged that &quot;Vivien is several thousand miles away, trembling on the edge of a cliff, even when she&#x27;s sitting quietly in her own drawing room&quot;, at a time when she was threatening suicide. In May 1960 divorce proceedings started; Leigh reported the fact to the press and informed reporters of Olivier&#x27;s relationship with Plowright. The decree &quot;nisi&quot; was issued in December 1960, which enabled him to marry Plowright in March 1961. A son, Richard, was born in December 1961; two daughters followed, Tamsin Agnes Margaret—born in January 1963—and actress Julie-Kate, born in July 1966.

In 1961 Olivier accepted the directorship of a new theatrical venture, the Chichester Festival. For the opening season in 1962 he directed two neglected 17th-century English plays, John Fletcher&#x27;s 1638 comedy &quot;The Chances&quot; and John Ford&#x27;s 1633 tragedy &quot;The Broken Heart&quot;, followed by &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;. The company he recruited was forty strong and included Thorndike, Casson, Redgrave, Athene Seyler, John Neville and Plowright. The first two plays were politely received; the Chekhov production attracted rapturous notices. &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;It is doubtful if the Moscow Arts Theatre itself could improve on this production.&quot; The second Chichester season the following year consisted of a revival of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; and two new productions—Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Saint Joan&quot; and John Arden&#x27;s &quot;The Workhouse Donkey&quot;. In 1963 Olivier received another BAFTA nomination for his leading role as a schoolteacher accused of sexually molesting a student in the film &quot;Term of Trial&quot;.

===National Theatre===
====1963–1968====
At around the time the Chichester Festival opened, plans for the creation of the National Theatre were coming to fruition. The British government agreed to release funds for a new building on the South Bank of the Thames. Lord Chandos was appointed chairman of the National Theatre Board in 1962, and in August Olivier accepted its invitation to be the company&#x27;s first director. As his assistants, he recruited the directors John Dexter and William Gaskill, with Kenneth Tynan as literary adviser or &quot;dramaturge&quot;. Pending the construction of the new theatre, the company was based at the Old Vic. With the agreement of both organisations, Olivier remained in overall charge of the Chichester Festival during the first three seasons of the National; he used the festivals of 1964 and 1965 to give preliminary runs to plays he hoped to stage at the Old Vic.

The opening production of the National Theatre was &quot;Hamlet&quot; in October 1963, starring Peter O&#x27;Toole and directed by Olivier. O&#x27;Toole was a guest star, one of occasional exceptions to Olivier&#x27;s policy of casting productions from a regular company. Among those who made a mark during Olivier&#x27;s directorship were Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Alan Bates, Derek Jacobi and Anthony Hopkins. It was widely remarked that Olivier seemed reluctant to recruit his peers to perform with his company. Evans, Gielgud and Paul Scofield guested only briefly, and Ashcroft and Richardson never appeared at the National during Olivier&#x27;s time. Robert Stephens, a member of the company, observed, &quot;Olivier&#x27;s one great fault was a paranoid jealousy of anyone who he thought was a rival&quot;.

In his decade in charge of the National, Olivier acted in thirteen plays and directed eight. Several of the roles he played were minor characters, including a crazed butler in Feydeau&#x27;s &quot;A Flea in Her Ear&quot; and a pompous solicitor in Maugham&#x27;s &quot;Home and Beauty&quot;; the vulgar soldier Captain Brazen in Farquhar&#x27;s 1706 comedy &quot;The Recruiting Officer&quot; was a larger role but not the leading one.

Apart from his Astrov in the &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, familiar from Chichester, his first leading role for the National was Othello, directed by Dexter in 1964. The production was a box-office success and was revived regularly over the next five seasons. His performance divided opinion. Most of the reviewers and theatrical colleagues praised it highly; Franco Zeffirelli called it &quot;an anthology of everything that has been discovered about acting in the past three centuries.&quot; Dissenting voices included &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, which called it &quot;the kind of bad acting of which only a great actor is capable ... near the frontiers of self-parody&quot;; the director Jonathan Miller thought it &quot;a condescending view of an Afro Caribbean person&quot;. The burden of playing this demanding part at the same time as managing the new company and planning for the move to the new theatre took its toll on Olivier. To add to his load, he felt obliged to take over as Solness in &quot;The Master Builder&quot; when the ailing Redgrave withdrew from the role in November 1964. For the first time Olivier began to suffer from stage fright, which plagued him for several years. The National Theatre production of &quot;Othello&quot; was released as a film in 1965, which earned four Academy Award nominations, including another for Best Actor for Olivier.

During the following year Olivier concentrated on management, directing one production (&quot;The Crucible&quot;), taking the comic role of the foppish Tattle in Congreve&#x27;s &quot;Love for Love&quot;, and making one film, &quot;Bunny Lake is Missing&quot;, in which he and Coward were on the same bill for the first time since &quot;Private Lives&quot;. In 1966, his one play as director was &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; commented that the production &quot;restores one&#x27;s faith in the work as a masterpiece&quot;. In the same year Olivier portrayed the Mahdi, opposite Heston as General Gordon, in the film &quot;Khartoum&quot;.

In 1967 Olivier was caught in the middle of a confrontation between Chandos and Tynan over the latter&#x27;s proposal to stage Rolf Hochhuth&#x27;s &quot;Soldiers&quot;. As the play speculatively depicted Churchill as complicit in the assassination of the Polish prime minister Władysław Sikorski, Chandos regarded it as indefensible. At his urging the board unanimously vetoed the production. Tynan considered resigning over this interference with the management&#x27;s artistic freedom, but Olivier himself stayed firmly in place, and Tynan also remained. At about this time Olivier began a long struggle against a succession of illnesses. He was treated for prostate cancer and, during rehearsals for his production of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot; he was hospitalised with pneumonia. He recovered enough to take the heavy role of Edgar in Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;The Dance of Death&quot;, the finest of all his performances other than in Shakespeare, in Gielgud&#x27;s view.

====1968–1974====
Olivier had intended to step down from the directorship of the National Theatre at the end of his first five-year contract, having, he hoped, led the company into its new building. By 1968 because of bureaucratic delays construction work had not even begun, and he agreed to serve for a second five-year term. His next major role, and his last appearance in a Shakespeare play, was as Shylock in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, his first appearance in the work. He had intended Guinness or Scofield to play Shylock, but stepped in when neither was available. The production by Jonathan Miller, and Olivier&#x27;s performance, attracted a wide range of responses. Two different critics reviewed it for &quot;The Guardian&quot;: one wrote &quot;this is not a role which stretches him, or for which he will be particularly remembered&quot;; the other commented that the performance &quot;ranks as one of his greatest achievements, involving his whole range&quot;.

In 1969 Olivier appeared in two war films, portraying military leaders. He played Field Marshal French in the First World War film &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot;, for which he won another BAFTA award, followed by Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding in &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;. In June 1970 he became the first actor to be created a peer for services to the theatre. Although he initially declined the honour, Harold Wilson, the incumbent prime minister, wrote to him, then invited him and Plowright to dinner, and persuaded him to accept.
After this Olivier played three more stage roles: James Tyrone in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; (1971–72), Antonio in Eduardo de Filippo&#x27;s &quot;Saturday, Sunday, Monday&quot; and John Tagg in Trevor Griffiths&#x27;s &quot;The Party&quot; (both 1973–74). Among the roles he hoped to play, but could not because of ill-health, was Nathan Detroit in the musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;. In 1972 he took leave of absence from the National to star opposite Michael Caine in Joseph L. Mankiewicz&#x27;s film of Anthony Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;Sleuth&quot;, which &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; considered to be &quot;Olivier at his twinkling, eye-rolling best&quot;; both he and Caine were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, losing to Marlon Brando in &quot;The Godfather&quot;.

The last two stage plays Olivier directed were Jean Giradoux&#x27;s &quot;Amphitryon&quot; (1971) and Priestley&#x27;s &quot;Eden End&quot; (1974). By the time of &quot;Eden End&quot;, he was no longer director of the National Theatre; Peter Hall took over on 1 November 1973. The succession was tactlessly handled by the board, and Olivier felt that he had been eased out—although he had declared his intention to go—and that he had not been properly consulted about the choice of successor. The largest of the three theatres within the National&#x27;s new building was named in his honour, but his only appearance on the stage of the Olivier Theatre was at its official opening by the Queen in October 1976, when he made a speech of welcome, which Hall privately described as the most successful part of the evening.

===1975–1989: Later years and death===
Olivier spent the last 15 years of his life securing his finances and dealing with deteriorating health, which included thrombosis and dermatomyositis, a degenerative muscle disorder. Professionally, and to provide financial security, he made a series of advertisements for Polaroid cameras in 1972, although he stipulated that they must never be shown in Britain; he also took a number of cameo film roles, which were in &quot;often undistinguished films&quot;, according to Billington. Olivier&#x27;s move from leading parts to supporting and cameo roles came about because his poor health meant he could not get the necessary long insurance for larger parts, with only short engagements in films available.

Olivier&#x27;s dermatomyositis meant he spent the last three months of 1974 in hospital, and he spent early 1975 slowly recovering and regaining his strength. When strong enough, he was contacted by the director John Schlesinger, who offered him the role of a Nazi torturer in the 1976 film &quot;Marathon Man&quot;. Olivier shaved his pate and wore oversized glasses to enlarge the look of his eyes, in a role that the critic David Robinson, writing for &quot;The Times&quot;, thought was &quot;strongly played&quot;, adding that Olivier was &quot;always at his best in roles that call for him to be seedy or nasty or both&quot;. Olivier was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and won the Golden Globe of the same category.

In the mid-1970s Olivier became increasingly involved in television work, a medium of which he was initially dismissive. In 1973 he provided the narration for a 26-episode documentary, &quot;The World at War&quot;, which chronicled the events of the Second World War, and won a second Emmy Award for &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; (1973). In 1975 he won another Emmy for &quot;Love Among the Ruins&quot;. The following year he appeared in adaptations of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; and Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Collection&quot;. Olivier portrayed the Pharisee Nicodemus in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s 1977 miniseries &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;. In 1978 he appeared in the film &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot;, playing the role of Ezra Lieberman, an ageing Nazi hunter; he received his eleventh Academy Award nomination. Although he did not win the Oscar, he was presented with an Honorary Award for his lifetime achievement.

Olivier continued working in film into the 1980s, with roles in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1980), &quot;Inchon&quot; (1981), &quot;The Bounty&quot; (1984) and &quot;Wild Geese II&quot; (1985). He continued to work in television; in 1981 he appeared as Lord Marchmain in &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, winning another Emmy, and the following year he received his tenth and last BAFTA nomination in the television adaptation of John Mortimer&#x27;s stage play &quot;A Voyage Round My Father&quot;. In 1983 he played his last Shakespearean role as Lear in &quot;King Lear&quot;, for Granada Television, earning his fifth Emmy. He thought the role of Lear much less demanding than other tragic Shakespearean heroes: &quot;No, Lear is easy. He&#x27;s like all of us, really: he&#x27;s just a stupid old fart.&quot; When the production was first shown on American television, the critic Steve Vineberg wrote:

The same year he also appeared in a cameo alongside Gielgud and Richardson in &quot;Wagner&quot;, with Burton in the title role; his final screen appearance was as an elderly wheelchair-using soldier in Derek Jarman&#x27;s 1989 film &quot;War Requiem&quot;.

After being ill for the last 22 years of his life, Olivier died of renal failure on 11 July 1989 aged 82 at his home in the village of Ashurst, near Steyning, West Sussex. His cremation was held three days later; a memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey in October that year, where his ashes were later buried in Poets&#x27; Corner.

==Awards and honours==

Olivier was appointed Knight Bachelor in the 1947 Birthday Honours for services to the stage and to films. A life peerage as Baron Olivier, of Brighton in the County of Sussex, followed in the 1970 Birthday Honours for services to the theatre. (He had declined a similar offer in 1967.) Olivier was later appointed to the Order of Merit in 1981. He also received honours from foreign governments. In 1949, he was made Commander of the Danish Order of the Dannebrog; France appointed him , Legion of Honour, in 1953; the Italian government created him , Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, in 1953; and in 1971 he was granted the Order of Yugoslav Flag with Golden Wreath.

From academic and other institutions, Olivier received honorary doctorates from Tufts University in Massachusetts (1946), Oxford (1957) and Edinburgh (1964). He was also awarded the Danish Sonning Prize in 1966, the Gold Medallion of the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities in 1968; and the Albert Medal of the Royal Society of Arts in 1976.

For his work in films, Olivier received three Academy Awards: an honorary award for &quot;Henry V&quot; (1947), a Best Actor award for &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1948), and a second honorary award in 1979 to recognise his lifetime of contribution to the art of film. As the producer for &quot;Hamlet&quot; he also collected the award for Best Picture at the 1949 ceremony. In total, he was nominated for ten acting Oscars and one for the direction of &quot; Hamlet&quot;. He also won two British Academy Film Awards out of ten nominations, five Emmy Awards out of nine nominations, and three Golden Globe Awards out of six nominations. He was nominated once for a Tony Award (for best actor, as Archie Rice) but did not win.

In February 1960, for his contribution to the film industry, Olivier was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, with a star at 6319 Hollywood Boulevard; he is included in the American Theater Hall of Fame. In 1977, Olivier was awarded a British Film Institute Fellowship.

In addition to the naming of the National Theatre&#x27;s largest auditorium in Olivier&#x27;s honour, he is commemorated in the Laurence Olivier Awards, bestowed annually since 1984 by the Society of London Theatre. In 1991, Gielgud unveiled a memorial stone commemorating Olivier in Poets&#x27; Corner at Westminster Abbey. In 2007, the centenary of Olivier&#x27;s birth, a life-sized statue of him was unveiled on the South Bank, outside the National Theatre; the same year the BFI held a retrospective season of his film work.

==Technique and reputation==
Olivier&#x27;s acting technique was minutely crafted, and he was known for changing his appearance considerably from role to role. By his own admission, he was addicted to extravagant make-up, and unlike Richardson and Gielgud, he excelled at different voices and accents. His own description of his technique was &quot;working from the outside in&quot;; he said, &quot;I can never act as myself, I have to have a pillow up my jumper, a false nose or a moustache or wig... I cannot come on looking like me and be someone else.&quot; Rattigan described how at rehearsals Olivier &quot;built his performance slowly and with immense application from a mass of tiny details&quot;. This attention to detail had its critics: Agate remarked, &quot;When I look at a watch it is to see the time and not to admire the mechanism. I want an actor to tell me Lear&#x27;s time of day and Olivier doesn&#x27;t. He bids me watch the wheels go round.&quot;
Tynan remarked to Olivier, &quot;you aren&#x27;t really a contemplative or philosophical actor&quot;; Olivier was known for the strenuous physicality of his performances in some roles. He told Tynan this was because he was influenced as a young man by Douglas Fairbanks, Ramon Navarro and John Barrymore in films, and Barrymore on stage as Hamlet: &quot;tremendously athletic. I admired that greatly, all of us did. ... One thought of oneself, idiotically, skinny as I was, as a sort of Tarzan.&quot; According to Morley, Gielgud was widely considered &quot;the best actor in the world from the neck up and Olivier from the neck down.&quot; Olivier described the contrast thus: &quot;I&#x27;ve always thought that we were the reverses of the same coin... the top half John, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity.&quot;

Olivier, a classically trained actor, was known to have been distrustful of method acting. In his memoir, &quot;On Acting&quot;, he exhorts actors to &quot;have Stanislavski with you in your study or in your limousine... but don&#x27;t bring him onto the film set.&quot; During production of &quot;The Prince and the Showgirl&quot;, he quarrelled with Marilyn Monroe, who was trained under Lee Strasberg&#x27;s method, over her acting process. Similarly, an anecdote casts him as offering Dustin Hoffman, enduring physical travails while playing in &quot;Marathon Man&quot;, a curt suggestion: &quot;why don&#x27;t you just try acting?&quot; Hoffman disputes the details of this account, which he claims was distorted by a journalist: he had been up all night at the Studio 54 nightclub for personal rather than professional reasons and Olivier, who understood this, was joking.

Together with Richardson and Gielgud, Olivier was internationally recognised as one of the &quot;great trinity of theatrical knights&quot; who dominated the British stage during the middle and later decades of the 20th century. In an obituary tribute in &quot;The Times&quot;, Bernard Levin wrote, &quot;What we have lost with Laurence Olivier is &quot;glory&quot;. He reflected it in his greatest roles; indeed he walked clad in it—you could practically see it glowing around him like a nimbus... no one will ever play the roles he played as he played them; no one will replace the splendour that he gave his native land with his genius.&quot; Billington commented:

After Olivier&#x27;s death, Gielgud reflected, &quot;He followed in the theatrical tradition of Kean and Irving. He respected tradition in the theatre, but he also took great delight in breaking tradition, which is what made him so unique. He was gifted, brilliant, and one of the great controversial figures of our time in theatre, which is a virtue and not a vice at all.&quot;

Olivier said in 1963 that he believed he was born to be an actor, but his colleague Peter Ustinov disagreed; he commented that although Olivier&#x27;s great contemporaries were clearly predestined for the stage, &quot;Larry could have been a notable ambassador, a considerable minister, a redoubtable cleric. At his worst, he would have acted the parts more ably than they are usually lived.&quot; The director David Ayliff agreed that acting did not come instinctively to Olivier as it did to his great rivals. He observed, &quot;Ralph [Richardson] was a natural actor, he couldn&#x27;t stop being a perfect actor; Olivier did it through sheer hard work and determination.&quot; The American actor William Redfield had a similar view:

In comparing Olivier and the other leading actors of his generation, Ustinov wrote, &quot;It is of course vain to talk of who is and who is not the greatest actor. There is simply no such thing as a greatest actor, or painter or composer&quot;. Nonetheless, some colleagues, particularly film actors such as Spencer Tracy, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, came to regard Olivier as the finest of his peers. Peter Hall, though acknowledging Olivier as the head of the theatrical profession, thought Richardson the greater actor. Olivier&#x27;s claim to theatrical greatness lay not only in his acting, but as, in Hall&#x27;s words, &quot;the supreme man of the theatre of our time&quot;, pioneering Britain&#x27;s National Theatre. As Melvyn Bragg identified, &quot;no one doubts that the National is perhaps his most enduring monument&quot;.

<text>A country dance is any of a very large number of social dances of a type that originated in England in the British Isles; it is the repeated execution of a predefined sequence of figures, carefully designed to fit a fixed length of music, performed by a group of people, usually in couples, in one or more sets. The figures involve interaction with your partner and/or with other dancers, usually with a progression so that you dance with everyone in your set. It is common in modern times to have a &quot;caller&quot; who teaches the dance and then calls the figures as you dance. Country dances are done in many different styles.

As a musical form written in or time, the contredanse was used by Beethoven and Mozart.
Beethoven&#x27;s 6 Ecosaises WoO83 are dated to 1806. Mozart&#x27;s 6 Ländlerische Tänze, K.606 are dated to 1791.
Introduced to South America by French immigrants, Country Dance had great influence upon Latin American music as contradanza.

The &quot;Anglais&quot; (from the French word meaning &quot;English&quot;) or &quot;Angloise&quot; is another term for the English country dance. A Scottish country dance may be termed an . Irish set dance is also related.

==Characteristics==

A &quot;set&quot; is a formation of dancers. The most common formations are &quot;longways for as many as will&quot;, i.e. couples in long lines, and &quot;squares&quot;, consisting of four couples. The longways formation occurs in more than 12,000 modern contra dances; it was also the most popular formation in all the dance publications of the 18th and early 19th centuries. In 2003, Burleson&#x27;s Square Dancer&#x27;s Encyclopedia listed 5125 calls or figures. Circles and fixed-length longways sets are also very common, but the possible formations are limited only by the imagination of the choreographer.

Thomas Wilson, in 1808, wrote, &quot;A Country Dance is composed of an indefinite number of persons, not less than six, but as many more as chuse, but six are sufficient to perform any figure in the treatise.&quot; Wilson was writing about his own period. In fact, there are numerous dances for two couples, and quite a few for three or five dancers.

A &quot;figure&quot; is a pattern that the dancers trace along the floor, simple ones such as Circle Left are intuitive and can be danced with no prior knowledge, while complex moves such as Strip the willow need to be taught. The stepping and style of dancing varies by region and by period.

Wilson in 1820 wrote, &quot;Country Dance Figures are certain Movements or Directions formed in Circular, Half Circular, Serpentine, Angular, Straight Lines, etc. etc. drawn out into different Lengths, adapted to the various &quot;Strains&quot; of Country Dance Music.&quot; . Again, the possible figures are limited only by the imagination of the choreographer. Examples of some of the figures are provided in the Glossary of country dance terms.

The music most commonly associated with country dancing is folk/country/traditional/historical music, however, modern bands are experimenting with countless other genres.

While some dances may have originated on village greens, the vast majority were, and still are, written by dancing masters and choreographers.

Each dance consists of a series of figures, hopefully smoothly linked together, designed to fit to the chosen music. The most common form of music is 32 bar jigs or reels, but any music suitable for dancing can be used. In most dances the dancers will progress to a new position so that the next time through the music they are dancing with different people.

While English folk dance clubs generally embrace all types of country dance, American English country dance groups tend to exclude modern contra dances and square dances.
Country dancing is intended for general participation, unlike folk dances such as clogging, which are primarily concert dances, and ballroom dances in which dancers dance with their partners independently of others. Bright, rhythmic and simple, country dances have appeal as a refreshing finale to an evening of stately dances such as the minuet.

Historically, the term &quot;contra dance&quot; is another name for a country dance. Howe, in 1858, wrote that &quot;The term &#x27;Country Dance&#x27; is the one invariably used in all books on dancing that have been published in England during the last three centuries, while all works issued in France within the same period employ the term Contra Dance, or in French &quot;Contre Danse&quot;. As the authority is equally good in both cases, either term is therefore correct. The Country or Contra Dance has been one of the most popular amusements in the British Isles, France, and other continental countries from time immemorial&quot;. However, &quot;contra dance&quot; is most commonly used today to refer to a specific American genre called contra dance.

==History==

Country dances began to influence courtly dance in the 15th century and became particularly popular at the court of Elizabeth I of England. Many references to country dancing and titles shared with known 17th-century dances appear from this time, though few of these can be shown to refer to English country dance. While some early features resemble the morris dance and other early styles, the influence of the courtly dances of Continental Europe, especially those of Renaissance Italy, may also be seen, and it is probable that English country dance was affected by these at an early date. Little is known of these dances before the mid-17th century.

John Playford&#x27;s &quot;The English Dancing Master&quot; (1651) listed over a hundred tunes, each with its own figures. This was enormously popular, reprinted constantly for 80 years and much enlarged. Playford and his successors had a practical monopoly on the publication of dance manuals until 1711, and ceased publishing around 1728. During this period English country dances took a variety of forms including finite sets for two, three and four couples as well as circles and squares.

The country dance was introduced to the court of Louis XIV of France, where it became known as &quot;contredanse&quot;, and later to Germany and Italy. André Lorin, who visited the English court in the late 17th century, presented a manuscript of dances in the English manner to Louis XIV on his return to France. In 1706 Raoul Auger Feuillet published his &quot;Recüeil de Contredances&quot;, a collection of &quot;contredanses anglaises&quot; presented in a simplified form of Beauchamp-Feuillet notation and including some dances invented by the author as well as authentic English dances. This was subsequently translated into English by John Essex and published in England as &quot;For the Further Improvement of Dancing&quot;.

By the 1720s the term &quot;contradanse&quot; had come to refer to longways sets divided into groups of three or two couples, which would remain normative until English country dance&#x27;s eclipse. The earliest French works refer only to the longways form as &quot;contradanse&quot;, which allowed the false etymology of &quot;a dance in which lines dance opposite one another&quot;. The square-set type also had its vogue in France and spread to much of Europe, Russia and North America during the later 18th century as the quadrille and the cotillion. These usually require a group of eight people, a couple along each side. &quot;Les Lanciers&quot;, a descendant of the &quot;quadrille&quot;, and the &quot;Eightsome Reel&quot; are examples of this kind of dance. Dancing in square sets still survives in Ireland, under the name &quot;set dancing&quot; or &quot;figure dancing&quot;.

For some time English publishers issued annual collections of these dances in popular pocket-books. Jane Austen, Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy all loved country dancing and put detailed descriptions into their novels. But the vogue for the waltz and the quadrille ousted the country dance from English ballrooms in the early 19th century, though Scottish country dance remained popular.

==Influence==

The English country dance and the French &quot;contredanse&quot;, arriving independently in the American colonies, became the New England contra dance, which experienced a resurgence in the mid-20th century. The quadrille evolved into square dance in the United States while in Ireland it contributed to the development of modern Irish set dance. English country dance in Scotland developed its own flavour and became the separate Scottish country dance. English céilidh is a special case, being a convergence of English, Irish and Scottish forms. In addition certain English country dances survived independently in the popular repertoire. One such is the Virginia Reel, which is almost exactly the same as the &quot;Sir Roger de Coverley&quot;.

The &quot;contradanza&quot;, the Spanish and Spanish-American version of the French &quot;contradanse&quot;, became an internationally popular style of music and dance in the 18th century. The &quot;contradanza&quot; was popular in Spain and spread throughout Spanish America during the 18th century, where it took on folkloric forms that still exist in Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Panama and Ecuador. In Cuba during the 19th century the &quot;contradanza&quot; became an important genre, the ancestor of danzon, mambo and cha cha cha. Haitians fleeing the Haitian Revolution of 1791 brought to the Cuban version a Creole influence and a new syncopation.

The &quot;Engelska&quot; (Swedish for &quot;English&quot;) or Danish &quot;Engelsk&quot; is a 16-bar Scandinavian folk dance in . Its name comes from the adoption in Scandinavia of English country dances and contra dances in the early 19th century. In Denmark the description &quot;Engelsk&quot; was used for both line and square dances of English origin.

==Revival==

Only due to the efforts of Cecil Sharp, Mary Neal and the English Folk Dance and Song Society in the late 19th and early 20th century did a revival take place, so that for some time schoolchildren were taught country dances. In the early 20th century, traditional and historical dances began to be revived in England. Neal, one of the first to do so, was principally known for her work in ritual dances, but Cecil Sharp, in the six volumes of his &quot;Country Dance Book&quot;, published between 1909 and 1922, attempted to reconstruct English country dance as it was performed at the time of Playford, using the surviving traditional English village dances as a guide, as the manuals defined almost none of the figures described. Sharp and his students were, however, almost wholly concerned with English country dances as found in the early dance manuals: Sharp published 160 dances from the Playford manuals and 16 traditional village country dances. Sharp believed that the Playford dances, especially those with irregular forms, represented the original &quot;folk&quot; form of English country dance and that all later changes in the dance&#x27;s long history were corruptions. This view is no longer held.

The first collection of modern English country dances since the 1820s, &quot;Maggot Pie&quot;, was published in 1932, though only in the late 20th century did modern compositions become fully accepted. Reconstructions of historical dances and new compositions continue. Interpreters and composers of the 20th century include Douglas and Helen Kennedy, Pat Shaw, Tom Cook, Ken Sheffield, Charles Bolton, Michael Barraclough, Colin Hume, Gary Roodman, and Andrew Shaw.
The modern English country dance community in the United States consists primarily of liberal white professionals.

<doc id="43699" wikidata="Q312889" url="?curid=43699" title="Peter Minuit">
<text>Peter Minuit (also Pierre Minuit (French version), or Peter Minnewit (Dutch version)) (between 1580 and 1585 – August 5, 1638) was a Walloon (then part of the Spanish Netherlands) merchant born in Wesel, in present-day northwestern Germany. He was the 3rd Director of the Dutch North American colony of New Netherland from 1626 until 1631, and 3rd Governor of New Netherland. He founded the Swedish colony of New Sweden on the Delaware Peninsula in 1638.

Minuit is generally credited with orchestrating the purchase of Manhattan Island for the Dutch West India Company from representatives of the Lenape, the area&#x27;s indigenous people. Manhattan later became the site of the Dutch city of New Amsterdam, and the borough of Manhattan of modern-day New York City. A letter written by Dutch merchant Peter Schaghen to directors of the Dutch East India Company stated that Manhattan was purchased for &quot;60 guilders worth of trade&quot;, an amount worth ~$1,143 U.S. dollars as of 2020.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Peter Minuit was born in Wesel, Germany between 1580 and 1585 into a Calvinist family that had moved from the city of Tournai (presently part of Wallonia, Belgium) in the Southern Netherlands controlled by Spain, in order to avoid Spanish Catholic authorities, who were not favorably disposed toward Protestants. His surname means &quot;midnight&quot; in French.

His father, Johann Minuit, died in 1609 and Peter took over management of the household and his father&#x27;s business. Peter had a good reputation in Wesel, attested by the fact that he was several times appointed a guardian. He also assisted the poor during the Spanish occupation of 1614–1619.

Minuit married Gertrude Raedts from Cleve on August 20, 1613. Gertrude was from a wealthy family and she probably helped Peter Minuit establish himself as a broker. A will drawn up in 1615 in the Dutch city of Utrecht, mentions &quot;Peter Minnewit&quot; as a diamond cutter. Whether he traded in other items is unknown. He spelled his own surname as &quot;Minuit&quot;, but the spelling &quot;Minnewit&quot; shows the pronunciation. Thus in some old books &quot;Minnewit&quot; is used. 

By 1624, the city was in an economic decline and in 1625, he had left Wesel and like others, went to Holland. At first, Gertrude went to stay with her relatives in Cleve.

===As director of New Netherland===


Minuit joined the Dutch West India Company, probably in the mid-1620s, and was sent with his family to New Netherland in 1625 to search for tradable goods other than the animal pelts that then were the major product coming from New Netherland. He returned in the same year, and in 1626 was appointed the new director of New Netherland, taking over from Willem Verhulst. He sailed to North America and arrived in the colony on May 4, 1626. 

Minuit is credited with purchasing the island of Manhattan from Native Americans in exchange for traded goods valued at 60 guilders. The figure of 60 guilders comes from a letter by a representative of the Dutch States-General and member of the board of the Dutch West India Company, Pieter Janszoon Schagen, to the States-General in November 1626. In 1844, New York historian John Romeyn Brodhead converted the figure of Fl 60 (or 60 guilders) to US$24. By 2006 sixty guilders in 1626 was worth approximately $1,000 in current dollars, according to the Institute for Social History of Amsterdam.

According to researchers at the National Library of the Netherlands, &quot;The original inhabitants of the area were unfamiliar with the European notions and definitions of ownership rights. For the Indians, water, air and land could not be traded. Such exchanges would also be difficult in practical terms because many groups migrated between their summer and winter quarters. It can be concluded that both parties probably went home with totally different interpretations of the sales agreement.&quot;

A contemporary purchase of rights in nearby Staten Island, to which Minuit also was party, involved duffel cloth, iron kettles, axe heads, hoes, wampum, drilling awls, &quot;Jew&#x27;s harps&quot;, and &quot;diverse other wares&quot;. &quot;If similar trade goods were involved in the Manhattan arrangement&quot;, Burrows and Wallace surmise, &quot;then the Dutch were engaged in high-end technology transfer, handing over equipment of enormous usefulness in tasks ranging from clearing land to drilling wampum.&quot;

Minuit conducted politics in a measure of democracy in the colony during his time in New Netherland. He was highest judge in the colony, but in both civil and criminal affairs he was assisted by a council of five colonists. This advisory body would advise the director and jointly with him would develop, administer, and adjudicate a body of laws to help govern the colony. In addition there was a schout-fiscal, half-sheriff, half-attorney-general, and the customs officer. During Minuit&#x27;s administration, several mills were built, trade grew exponentially, and the population grew to almost 300.

In 1632, the Dutch West India Company (WIC) suspended Minuit from his post for reasons that are unclear, but probably for (perhaps unintentionally) abetting the landowning patroons who were engaging in illegal fur trade and otherwise enriching themselves against the interests and orders of the West India Company. He arrived back in Europe in August 1632 to explain his actions, but was dismissed and was succeeded as director by Wouter van Twiller. It is possible that Minuit had become the victim of the internal disputes over the rights that the board of directors had given to the patroons.

===Establishing the New Sweden colony===
After having lived in Emmerich (Duchy of Cleves) for several years, Minuit made arrangements with Samuel Blommaert and the Swedish government in 1637 to create the first Swedish colony in the New World. Located on the lower Delaware River within territory earlier claimed by the Dutch, it was called New Sweden. Minuit and his company arrived on the &quot;Fogel Grip&quot; and &quot;Kalmar Nyckel&quot; at Swedes&#x27; Landing, which is present-day Wilmington, Delaware, on 29 March, 1638. Minuit left the colony on 20 May, 1638 and sailed to the Caribbean island of St. Christopher, where he arrived on 15 June to barter salt, a ship&#x27;s cargo of wine and liquor for tobacco to make the voyage profitable.

== Death ==
During this voyage, Minuit drowned when the ship he was visiting (at the invitation of its Dutch captain, a friend of Minuit), &quot;The Flying Deer&quot;, was lost with all hands during a hurricane near St. Kitts. One ship sank near the Azores, another arrived without mast. The losses suffered, such as goods and Minuit, caused irreversible damage to Sweden&#x27;s colonization attempts. Two years later, Swedish Lt. Måns Nilsson Kling, whose rank was raised to captain, replaced Minuit as governor. Nine expeditions to the colony were carried out before the Dutch captured it in 1655.

Each night at midnight, LED lights around the pavilion&#x27;s perimeter glow in honor of Minuit.
*A marker in Inwood Hill Park at the supposed site of the purchase of Manhattan.
*A granite flagstaff base in Battery Park, which depicts the historic purchase
*A school and playground in East Harlem, which are named for him.
*An apartment building at 25 Claremont Avenue in Manhattan, which bears his name above the front entrance
*The Peter Minuit Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution
*A memorial on Moltkestraße in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany

===In popular culture===
*The beginning lines of Rodgers and Hart&#x27;s 1939 song &quot;Give It Back to the Indians&quot; recount the sale of Manhattan: &quot;Old Peter Minuit had nothing to lose when he bought the isle of Manhattan / For twenty-six dollars and a bottle of booze, and they threw in the Bronx and Staten / Pete thought he had the best of the bargain, but the poor red man just grinned / And he grunted &quot;ugh!&quot; (meaning &quot;okay&quot; in his jargon) for he knew poor Pete was skinned.&quot;
*Minuit was played by Groucho Marx in the 1957 comedy film &quot;The Story of Mankind&quot;.
*Minuit was played by Michael Landon in the 1970 film &quot;Swing Out, Sweet Land&quot;.
*Minuit is mentioned on the HBO drama &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;, where the character Edward Bader tells a joke featuring the line, &quot;&#x27;50 bucks?&#x27; the fella says. &#x27;Peter Stuyvesant only paid 24 for the entire island of Manhattan!&#x27;&quot;, while Steve Buscemi&#x27;s&#x27; character Enoch &#x27;Nucky&#x27; Thompson has to correct Bader and inform him that it was in fact Peter Minuit who bought Manhattan, not Stuyvesant.
*Bob Dylan mentions Minuit in his song &quot;Hard Times in New York Town&quot; (released on The Bootleg Series Volume 1) in the following line: &quot;Mister Hudson come a-sailing down the stream, / and old Mister Minuit paid for his dream.&quot; In the released recording of the song, however, Dylan spoonerizes &quot;Mister Minuit&quot; by mispronouncing his name as &quot;Minnie Mistuit.&quot; The official lyrics have the correct version of the name, except that Minuit is spelled &quot;Minuet.&quot;
*Minuit is mentioned in the first episode, &quot;Uno&quot;, of the AMC drama &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;. Jimmy McGill (the later titular Saul), while confronting lawyers at his brother&#x27;s law firm, accuses them of being &quot;like Peter Minuit&quot; and suggests that they &quot;throw in some beads and shells&quot; to the $26,000.00 being given to his brother.
*In &quot;Manahatta&quot;, a play by Mary Kathryn Nagle, Minuit is a featured character, depicted in his involvement in the colonization of Turtle Island.

<text>Flint, occasionally flintstone, is a sedimentary cryptocrystalline form of the mineral quartz, categorized as the variety of chert that occurs in chalk or marly limestone. Historically, flint was widely used to make stone tools and start fires.

Flint occurs chiefly as nodules and masses in sedimentary rocks, such as chalks and limestones. Inside the nodule, flint is usually dark grey or black, green, white, or brown in colour, and has a glassy or waxy appearance. A thin, oxidised layer on the outside of the nodules is usually different in colour, typically white and rough in texture. The nodules can often be found along streams and beaches.

Flint breaks and chips into sharp-edged pieces, making it useful in constructing a variety of cutting tools, such as knife blades and scrapers. The use of flint to make stone tools dates back more than three million years; flint&#x27;s extreme durability has made it possible to accurately date its use over this time. Flint is one of the primary materials used to define the Stone Age.
During the Stone Age, access to flint was so important for survival that people would travel or trade long distances to obtain the stone. Grime&#x27;s Graves was an important source of flint traded across Europe. Flint Ridge in Ohio was another important source of flint, and Native Americans extracted the flint from hundreds of quarries along the ridge. This &quot;Ohio Flint&quot; was traded across the eastern United States, and has been found as far west as the Rocky Mountains and south around the Gulf of Mexico.

When struck against steel, flint will produce enough sparks to ignite a fire with the correct tinder, or gunpowder used in weapons, namely the flintlock firing mechanism. Although it has been superseded in these uses by different processes (the percussion cap), or materials (ferrocerium), &quot;flint&quot; has lent its name as generic term for a fire starter.

==Origin==
The exact mode of formation of flint is not yet clear, but it is thought that it occurs as a result of chemical changes in compressed sedimentary rock formations during the process of diagenesis. One hypothesis is that a gelatinous material fills cavities in the sediment, such as holes bored by crustaceans or molluscs and that this becomes silicified. This hypothesis would certainly explain the complex shapes of flint nodules that are found. The source of dissolved silica in the porous media could be the spicules of silicious sponges (demosponges). Certain types of flint, such as that from the south coast of England and its counterpart on the French side of the Channel, contain trapped fossilised marine flora. Pieces of coral and vegetation have been found preserved inside the flint similar to insects and plant parts within amber. Thin slices of the stone often reveal this effect.
Flint sometimes occurs in large flint fields in Jurassic or Cretaceous beds, for example, in Europe. Puzzling giant flint formations known as paramoudra and flint circles are found around Europe but especially in Norfolk, England, on the beaches at Beeston Bump and West Runton.

The &quot;Ohio flint&quot; is the official gemstone of Ohio state. It is formed from limey debris that was deposited at the bottom of inland Paleozoic seas hundreds of millions of years ago that hardened into limestone and later became infused with silica. The flint from Flint Ridge is found in many hues like red, green, pink, blue, white, and grey, with the colour variations caused by minute impurities of iron compounds.

Flint can be coloured: sandy brown, medium to dark grey, black, reddish brown or an off-white grey.

==Uses==

===Tools or cutting edges===
Flint was used in the manufacture of tools during the Stone Age as it splits into thin, sharp splinters called flakes or blades (depending on the shape) when struck by another hard object (such as a hammerstone made of another material). This process is referred to as knapping.

Flint mining is attested since the Paleolithic, but became more common since the Neolithic (Michelsberg culture, Funnelbeaker culture). In Europe, some of the best toolmaking flint has come from Belgium (Obourg, flint mines of Spiennes), the coastal chalks of the English Channel, the Paris Basin, Thy in Jutland (flint mine at Hov), the Sennonian deposits of Rügen, Grimes Graves in England, the Upper Cretaceous chalk formation of Dobruja and the lower Danube (Balkan flint), the Cenomanian chalky marl formation of the Moldavian Plateau (Miorcani flint) and the Jurassic deposits of the Kraków area and Krzemionki in Poland, as well as of the Lägern (silex) in the Jura Mountains of Switzerland.

In 1938, a project of the Ohio Historical Society, under the leadership of H. Holmes Ellis began to study the knapping methods and techniques of Native Americans. Like past studies, this work involved experimenting with actual knapping techniques by creation of stone tools through the use of techniques like direct freehand percussion, freehand pressure and pressure using a rest. Other scholars who have conducted similar experiments and studies include William Henry Holmes, Alonzo W. Pond, Francis H. S. Knowles and Don Crabtree.

To reduce susceptibility to fragmentation, flint/chert may be heat-treated, being slowly brought up to a temperature of for 24 hours, then slowly cooled to room temperature. This makes the material more homogeneous and thus more and produces tools with a cleaner, sharper cutting edge. Heat treating was known to Stone Age artisans.

===To ignite fire or gunpowder===
When struck against steel, a flint edge produces sparks. The hard flint edge shaves off a particle of the steel that exposes iron, which reacts with oxygen from the atmosphere and can ignite the proper tinder.

Prior to the wide availability of steel, rocks of pyrite (FeS2) would be used along with the flint, in a similar (but more time-consuming) way. These methods remain popular in woodcraft, bushcraft, and amongst people practising traditional fire-starting skills.

====Flintlocks====
A later, major use of flint and steel was in the flintlock mechanism, used primarily in flintlock firearms, but also used on dedicated fire-starting tools. A piece of flint held in the jaws of a spring-loaded hammer, when released by a trigger, strikes a hinged piece of steel (&quot;frizzen&quot;) at an angle, creating a shower of sparks and exposing a charge of priming powder. The sparks ignite the priming powder and that flame, in turn, ignites the main charge, propelling the ball, bullet, or shot through the barrel. While the military use of the flintlock declined after the adoption of the percussion cap from the 1840s onward, flintlock rifles and shotguns remain in use amongst recreational shooters.

====Comparison with ferrocerium====

Flint and steel used to strike sparks were superseded in the 20th century by ferrocerium (sometimes referred to as &quot;flint&quot;, although not true flint, &quot;mischmetal&quot;, &quot;hot spark&quot;, &quot;metal match&quot;, or &quot;fire steel&quot;). This human-made material, when scraped with any hard, sharp edge, produces sparks that are much hotter than obtained with natural flint and steel, allowing use of a wider range of tinders. Because it can produce sparks when wet and can start fires when used correctly, ferrocerium is commonly included in survival kits. Ferrocerium is used in many cigarette lighters, where it is referred to as &quot;a flint&quot;.

====Fragmentation====

Flint&#x27;s utility as a fire starter is hampered by its property of uneven expansion under heating, causing it to fracture, sometimes violently, during heating. This tendency is enhanced by the impurities found in most samples of flint that may expand to a greater or lesser degree than the surrounding stone, and is similar to the tendency of glass to shatter when exposed to heat, and can become a drawback when flint is used as a building material.

===As a building material===

Flint, knapped or unknapped, has been used from antiquity (for example at the Late Roman fort of Burgh Castle in Norfolk) up to the present day as a material for building stone walls, using lime mortar, and often combined with other available stone or brick rubble. It was most common in those parts of southern England where no good building stone was available locally, and where brick-making was not widespread until the later Middle Ages. It is especially associated with East Anglia, but also used in chalky areas stretching through Hampshire, Sussex, Surrey and Kent to Somerset.

Flint was used in the construction of many churches, houses, and other buildings, for example, the large stronghold of Framlingham Castle. Many different decorative effects have been achieved by using different types of knapping or arrangement and combinations with stone (flushwork), especially in the 15th and early 16th centuries. Because knapping flints to a relatively flush surface and size is a highly skilled process with a high level of wastage, flint finishes typically indicate high status buildings.

During World War I, in the chalky-soil country of France, the British filled sandbags with flint and used these sandbags as breastworks.

===Ceramics===
Flint pebbles are used as the media in ball mills to grind glazes and other raw materials for the ceramics industry. The pebbles are hand-selected based on colour; those having a tint of red, indicating high iron content, are discarded. The remaining blue-grey stones have a low content of chromophoric oxides and so are less deleterious to the colour of the ceramic composition after firing.
Until recently calcined flint was also an important raw material in clay-based ceramic bodies produced in the UK. In clay bodies, calcined flint attenuates the shrinkage whilst drying, and modifies the fired thermal expansion. Flint can also be used in glazes as a network former.

<text>Edwin Beard Budding (25 August 1796 – 25 September 1846), an engineer born in Eastington, Stroud, Gloucestershire, was the English inventor of the lawnmower (1830) and adjustable spanner (1842).

==Lawnmower==

Budding had the idea of the lawnmower after seeing a machine in a local cloth mill that used a cutting cylinder (or bladed reel) mounted on a bench to trim the irregular nap from the surface of woolen cloth and give a smooth finish.
Budding&#x27;s mower was designed primarily to cut the lawn on sports grounds and extensive gardens, as a superior alternative to the scythe, and was granted a British patent on 31 August 1830. It took ten more years and further innovations to create a machine that could be worked by animals, and sixty years before a steam-powered lawn mower was built. 

The first machine produced was 19 inches in width with a frame made of wrought iron. The mower was pushed from behind with motive power coming from the rear land roller which drove gears to transfer the drive to the knives on the cutting cylinder; the ratio was 16:1. There was another roller placed in between the cutting cylinder and the land roller which was adjustable to alter the height of cut. On cutting, the grass clippings were hurled forward into a tray-like box. It was soon realized, however, that an extra handle was needed in front of the machine which could be used to help pull it along. Two of the earliest Budding machines sold went to Regent&#x27;s Park Zoological Gardens in London and the Oxford Colleges. 

In an agreement between John Ferrabee and Edwin Budding, dated 18 May 1830, Ferrabee paid the costs of development, obtained letters of patent and acquired rights to manufacture, sell and license other manufacturers in the production of lawn mowers. Budding realized that a similar device could be used to cut grass if the mechanism was mounted in a wheeled frame to make the blades rotate close to the lawn&#x27;s surface. Budding went into partnership with a local engineer, John Ferrabee, and together they made mowers in a factory at Thrupp near Stroud.

Examples of the early Budding type mowers can be seen in Stroud Museum, the London Science Museum and at Milton Keynes Museum.

==Adjustable spanner==

Budding is also credited with the invention of the screw adjustable spanner (adjustable crescent wrench) in 1842.

==Firearms==
Budding&#x27;s engineering and manufacturing skills also extended to the production of a five-shot percussion revolver having brass manually-rotated barrels in about 1830.

<text>Cryptocrystalline is a rock texture made up of such minute crystals that its crystalline nature is only vaguely revealed even microscopically in thin section by transmitted polarized light. Among the sedimentary rocks, chert and flint are cryptocrystalline. Carbonado, a form of diamond, is also cryptocrystalline. Volcanic rocks, especially of the felsic type such as felsites and rhyolites, may have a cryptocrystalline groundmass as distinguished from pure obsidian (felsic) or tachylyte (mafic), which are natural rock glasses. Agate and onyx are examples of cryptocrystalline silica (chalcedony). The quartz crystals in chalcedony are so tiny that they cannot be distinguished with the naked eye.

<text>Duct tape or duck tape is cloth- or scrim-backed pressure-sensitive tape, often coated with polyethylene. A variety of constructions exist using different backings and adhesives, and the term &quot;duct tape&quot; has been genericized to refer to all of them. A variation is heat-resistant foil tape useful for sealing heating and cooling ducts, produced because standard duct tape fails when used on heating ducts. 

Duct tape is generally silvery gray in color, but also available in other colors and printed designs, from whimsical yellow ducks to practical camouflage patterns. It is often confused with gaffer tape which is designed to be non-reflective and cleanly removed, unlike duct tape.

During World War II, Revolite (then a division of Johnson &amp; Johnson) developed an adhesive tape made from a rubber-based adhesive applied to a durable duck cloth backing. This tape resisted water and was used to seal some ammunition cases during that period.

&quot;Duck tape&quot; is recorded in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; as having been in use since 1899 and &quot;duct tape&quot; (described as &quot;perhaps an alteration of earlier duck tape&quot;) since 1965.

==History==
The first material called &quot;duck tape&quot; was long strips of plain non-adhesive cotton duck cloth used in making shoes stronger, for decoration on clothing, and for wrapping steel cables or electrical conductors to protect them from corrosion or wear. For instance, in 1902, steel cables supporting the Manhattan Bridge were first covered in linseed oil then wrapped in duck tape before being laid in place. In the 1910s, certain boots and shoes used canvas duck fabric for the upper or for the insole, and duck tape was sometimes sewn in for reinforcement. In 1936, the US-based Insulated Power Cables Engineers Association specified a wrapping of duck tape as one of many methods used to protect rubber-insulated power cables. In 1942, Gimbel&#x27;s department store offered venetian blinds that were held together with vertical strips of duck tape. 

Glue backed or impregnated adhesive tapes of various sorts were in use by the 1910s, including rolls of cloth tape with adhesive coating one side. White adhesive tape made of cloth soaked in rubber and zinc oxide was used in hospitals to bind wounds, but other tapes such as friction tape or electrical tape could be substituted in an emergency. In 1930, the magazine &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; described how to make adhesive tape at home using plain cloth tape soaked in a heated liquid mixture of rosin and rubber from inner tubes.

In 1923, tape pioneer Richard Gurley Drew at 3M invented masking tape, a paper-based tape with a mildly sticky adhesive intended to be temporarily used and removed rather than left in place permanently. In 1925, this became the &quot;Scotch&quot; brand masking tape. In 1930, Drew developed a transparent cellophane-based tape, dubbed Scotch tape. This tape was widely used beginning in the Great Depression to repair household items. Neither of these inventions was based on cloth tape.

The ultimate wide-scale adoption of duck tape, today generally referred to as duct tape, came from ordnance worker Vesta Stoudt. Stoudt was worried that problems with ammunition box seals could cost soldiers precious time in battle, so she wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1943 with the idea to seal the boxes with a fabric tape prototype which she had tested. The letter was forwarded to the War Production Board, which put Johnson &amp; Johnson on the job. The Revolite division of Johnson &amp; Johnson had made medical adhesive tapes based on duck cloth from 1927, and a team headed by Revolite&#x27;s Johnny Denoye and Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Bill Gross developed the new adhesive tape, designed to be ripped by hand, not cut with scissors.

Their new unnamed product was made of thin cotton duck coated in waterproof polyethylene (plastic) with a layer of rubber-based gray adhesive (branded as &quot;Polycoat&quot;) bonded to one side. It was easy to apply and remove and was soon adapted to repair military equipment quickly, including vehicles and weapons. This tape, colored in army-standard matte olive drab, was widely used by the soldiers.
After the war, the duck tape product was sold in hardware stores for household repairs. The Melvin A. Anderson Company of Cleveland, Ohio, acquired the rights to the tape in 1950. It was commonly used in construction to wrap air ducts. Following this application, the name &quot;duct tape&quot; came into use in the 1950s, along with tape products that were colored silvery gray like tin ductwork. Specialized heat- and cold-resistant tapes were developed for heating and air-conditioning ducts. By 1960, a St. Louis, Missouri, HVAC company, Albert Arno, Inc., trademarked the name &quot;Ductape&quot; for their &quot;flame-resistant&quot; duct tape, capable of holding together at .

In 1971, Jack Kahl bought the Anderson firm and renamed it Manco. In 1975, Kahl rebranded the duct tape made by his company. He was able to trademark the brand &quot;Duck Tape&quot; and market his product complete with a yellow cartoon duck logo. Manco chose the term &quot;Duck&quot;, the tape&#x27;s original name, as &quot;a play on the fact that people often refer to duct tape as &#x27;duck tape, and as a marketing differentiation to stand out against other sellers of duct tape. In 1979, the Duck Tape marketing plan involved sending out greeting cards with the duck branding, four times a year, to 32,000 hardware managers. This mass of communication combined with colorful, convenient packaging helped Duck Tape become popular. From a near-zero customer base, Manco eventually controlled 40% of the duct tape market in the US. Acquired by Henkel in 1998, Duck Tape was sold to Shurtape Technologies in 2009.
Shurtape introduced a strong, weather-resistant version called &quot;T-Rex Tape&quot;. &quot;Ultimate Duck&quot;, which had been Henkel&#x27;s top-of-the-line variety, is still sold in the United Kingdom. Ultimate Duck, T-Rex Tape, and the competing Gorilla Tape all advertise &quot;three-layer technology&quot;.

After profiting from Scotch Tape in the 1930s, 3M had produced military materiel during World War II and by 1946 had developed the first practical vinyl electrical tape. By 1977, the company was selling a heat-resistant duct tape for heating ducts. In the late 1990s, 3M&#x27;s tape division had an annual turnover of $300 million and was the US industry leader. In 2004, 3M released a semi-transparent duct tape, with a clear polyethylene film and white fiberglass mesh.

==Manufacture==

Modern duct tape is made variously from cotton, polyester, nylon, rayon or fiberglass mesh fabric to provide strength. The fabric, a very thin gauze called &quot;scrim&quot;, is laminated to a backing of low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The color of the LDPE is provided by various pigments; the usual gray color comes from powdered aluminum mixed into the LDPE. Two tape widths are common: and . Other widths are also offered. The largest commercial rolls of duct tape were made in 2005 for Henkel, with width, a roll diameter of and weighing .

== Common uses ==
Duct tape is commonly used in situations that require a strong, flexible, and very sticky tape. Some have a long-lasting adhesive and resistance to weathering.

A specialized version, gaffer tape, which does not leave a sticky residue when removed, is preferred by gaffers in the theatre, motion picture and television industries.

=== Ductwork ===
The product now commonly called duct tape has largely been displaced in HVAC uses with specialized foil tapes designed for sealing heating and ventilation ducts (sometimes referred to erroneously as &quot;duct tapes&quot;). 

Common duct tape carries no safety certifications such as UL or Proposition 65, which means the tape may burn violently, producing toxic smoke; it may cause ingestion and contact toxicity, it can have irregular mechanical strength, and its adhesive may have low life expectancy. Its use in ducts has been prohibited by the state of California and by building codes in many other places.

Research was conducted in 1998 on standard duct tape at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Environmental Energy Technologies Division, which concluded that under challenging but realistic conditions duct tape becomes brittle, fails, and may even fall off completely.

=== Spaceflight ===
According to NASA engineer Jerry Woodfill duct tape had been stowed on board every mission since early in the Gemini program.

NASA engineers and astronauts have used duct tape in their work, including in some emergency situations. One such usage occurred in 1970 when Woodfill was working in Mission Control, when the square carbon dioxide filters from Apollo 13&#x27;s failed command module had to be modified to fit round receptacles in the lunar module, which was being used as a lifeboat after an explosion en route to the Moon. A workaround used duct tape and other items on board Apollo 13, with the ground crew relaying instructions to the flight crew. The lunar module&#x27;s CO2 scrubbers started working again, saving the lives of the three astronauts on board.

Ed Smylie, who designed the scrubber modification in just two days, said later that he knew the problem was solvable when it was confirmed that duct tape was on the spacecraft: &quot;I felt like we were home free,&quot; he said in 2005. &quot;One thing a Southern boy will never say is, &#x27;I don&#x27;t think duct tape will fix it.

Duct tape, referred to as &quot;...good old-fashioned American gray tape...&quot; was used by the Apollo 17 astronauts on the Moon to improvise a repair to a damaged fender on the lunar rover, preventing possible damage from the spray of lunar dust as they drove.

=== Military ===
In the US submarine fleet, an adhesive cloth tape is called &quot;EB Green,&quot; as the duct tape used by Electric Boat was green. It is also called &quot;duck tape&quot;, &quot;riggers&#x27; tape&quot;, &quot;hurricane tape&quot;, or &quot;100-mph tape&quot;; a name that comes from the use of a specific variety of duct tape that was supposed to withstand up to winds. The tape is so named because it was used during the Vietnam War to repair or balance helicopter rotor blades.

=== Alternative uses ===
Duct tape&#x27;s widespread popularity and multitude of uses has earned it a strong place in popular culture, and has inspired a vast number of creative and imaginative applications.

Duct tape occlusion therapy (DTOT) is a method intended to treat warts by covering them with duct tape for an extended period. The evidence for its effectiveness is poor; thus, it is not recommended as routine treatment. However, other studies suggest the duct tape treatment is more effective than existing medical options. Duct tape is often used in shoe repair due to its resiliency.

Duct tape has been used to temporarily fix Apple&#x27;s iPhone 4 dropped call issue, as an alternative to Apple&#x27;s own rubber case.

==In popular culture==

The Duct Tape Guys (Jim Berg and Tim Nyberg) have written seven books about duct tape, . Their books have sold over 1.5 million copies and feature real and unusual uses of duct tape. In 1994 they coined the phrase &quot;it ain&#x27;t broke, it just lacks duct tape&quot;. 

The sitcom &quot;The Red Green Show&quot; title character often used duct tape (which he dubbed &quot;the handyman&#x27;s secret weapon&quot;) as both a shortcut to proper fastening as well as for unconventional uses. The series sometimes showcased fan duct tape creations. The series had a feature film based on it entitled &quot;Duct Tape Forever&quot; and several VHS/DVD compilations of the show&#x27;s use of the tape have been released. Since 2000, series star Steve Smith (as &quot;Red Green&quot;) has been the &quot;Ambassador of Scotch Duct Tape&quot; for 3M.

The Discovery Channel series &quot;MythBusters&quot; featured duct tape in a number of myths that involve non-traditional uses. Confirmed myths include suspending a car for a period of time, building a functional cannon, a two-person sailboat, a two-person canoe (with duct tape paddles), a two-person raft, Roman sandals, a chess set, a leak proof water canister, rope, a hammock that can support the weight of an adult male, holding a car in place, a bridge that spanned the width of a dry dock, and a full-scale functional trebuchet with duct tape as the only binder. In the episode &quot;Duct Tape Plane&quot;, the MythBusters repaired (and eventually replaced) the skin of a lightweight airplane with duct tape and flew it a few meters above a runway.

Garrison Keillor&#x27;s radio show &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; included comedic fictional commercials sponsored by the &quot;American Duct Tape Council&quot;.

In 2019 Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan created a concept art piece titled &quot;Comedian&quot; involving taping a banana to a wall using silver duct tape. The piece was exhibited briefly at the Art Basel in Miami.

==Duct tape alert==

The term &quot;duct tape alert&quot; refers to the recommendations made by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on February 10, 2003, that Americans should prepare for a biological, chemical, or radiological terrorist attack by assembling a &quot;disaster supply kit&quot;, including duct tape and plastic (presumably to attempt to seal one&#x27;s home against nuclear, chemical, and biological contaminants), among other items. The recommendations followed an increase in the Department&#x27;s official threat level to &quot;orange&quot;, or &quot;high risk&quot;, citing &quot;recent intelligence reports&quot;. According to press reports, the recommendations caused a surge in demand for duct tape.

<text>Radiation pressure (also known as light pressure) is mechanical pressure exerted upon a surface due to the exchange of momentum between the object and the electromagnetic field. This includes the momentum of light or electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength that is absorbed, reflected, or otherwise emitted (e.g. black-body radiation) by matter on any scale (from macroscopic objects to dust particles to gas molecules). The associated force is called the radiation pressure force, or sometimes just the force of light.

The forces generated by radiation pressure are generally too small to be noticed under everyday circumstances; however, they are important in some physical processes and technologies. This particularly includes objects in outer space, where it is usually the main force acting on objects besides gravity, and where the net effect of a tiny force may have a large cumulative effect over long periods of time. For example, had the effects of the Sun&#x27;s radiation pressure on the spacecraft of the &quot;Viking&quot; program been ignored, the spacecraft would have missed Mars orbit by about . Radiation pressure from starlight is crucial in a number of astrophysical processes as well. The significance of radiation pressure increases rapidly at extremely high temperatures and can sometimes dwarf the usual gas pressure, for instance, in stellar interiors and thermonuclear weapons. Furthermore, large lasers operating in space have been suggested as a means of propelling sail craft in beam-powered propulsion.

Radiation pressure forces are the bedrock of laser technology and the branches of science that rely heavily on lasers and other optical technologies. That includes, but is not limited to, biomicroscopy (where light is used to irradiate and observe microbes, cells, and molecules), quantum optics, and optomechanics (where light is used to probe and control objects like atoms, qubits and macroscopic quantum objects). Direct applications of the radiation pressure force in these fields are, for example, laser cooling (the subject of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics), quantum control of macroscopic objects and atoms (2012 Nobel Prize in Physics), interferometry (2017 Nobel Prize in Physics) and optical tweezers (2018 Nobel Prize in Physics).

Radiation pressure can equally well be accounted for by considering the momentum of a classical electromagnetic field or in terms of the momenta of photons, particles of light. The interaction of electromagnetic waves or photons with matter may involve an exchange of momentum. Due to the law of conservation of momentum, any change in the total momentum of the waves or photons must involve an equal and opposite change in the momentum of the matter it interacted with (Newton&#x27;s third law of motion), as is illustrated in the accompanying figure for the case of light being perfectly reflected by a surface. This transfer of momentum is the general explanation for what we term radiation pressure.

== Discovery ==

Johannes Kepler put forward the concept of radiation pressure in 1619 to explain the observation that a tail of a comet always points away from the Sun.

The assertion that light, as electromagnetic radiation, has the property of momentum and thus exerts a pressure upon any surface that is exposed to it was published by James Clerk Maxwell in 1862, and proven experimentally by Russian physicist Pyotr Lebedev in 1900 and by Ernest Fox Nichols and Gordon Ferrie Hull in 1901. The pressure is very small, but can be detected by allowing the radiation to fall upon a delicately poised vane of reflective metal in a Nichols radiometer (this should not be confused with the Crookes radiometer, whose characteristic motion is &quot;not&quot; caused by radiation pressure but by air flow caused by temperature differentials.)

== Theory ==

Radiation pressure can be viewed as a consequence of the conservation of momentum given the momentum attributed to electromagnetic radiation. That momentum can be equally well calculated on the basis of electromagnetic theory or from the combined momenta of a stream of photons, giving identical results as is shown below.

=== Radiation pressure from momentum of an electromagnetic wave ===

According to Maxwell&#x27;s theory of electromagnetism, an electromagnetic wave carries momentum. Momentum will be transferred to any surface it strikes that absorbs or reflects the radiation.

Consider the momentum transferred to a perfectly absorbing (black) surface. The energy flux (irradiance) of a plane wave is calculated using the Poynting vector , which is the cross product of the electric field vector &quot;E&quot; and the magnetic field&#x27;s auxiliary field vector (or &quot;magnetizing field&quot;) &quot;H&quot;. The magnitude, denoted by &quot;S&quot;, divided by the speed of light is the density of the linear momentum per unit area (pressure) of the electromagnetic field. So, dimensionally, the Poynting vector is , which is the speed of light, , times pressure, . That pressure is experienced as radiation pressure on the surface:
formula_1
where formula_2 is pressure (usually in pascals), formula_3 is the incident irradiance (usually in W/m2) and formula_4 is the speed of light in vacuum. Here, .

If the surface is planar at an angle &quot;α&quot; to the incident wave, the intensity across the surface will be geometrically reduced by the cosine of that angle and the component of the radiation force against the surface will also be reduced by the cosine of &quot;α&quot;, resulting in a pressure:
formula_5

The momentum from the incident wave is in the same direction of that wave. But only the component of that momentum normal to the surface contributes to the pressure on the surface, as given above. The component of that force tangent to the surface is not called pressure.

=== Radiation pressure from reflection ===
The above treatment for an incident wave accounts for the radiation pressure experienced by a black (totally absorbing) body. If the wave is specularly reflected, then the recoil due to the reflected wave will further contribute to the radiation pressure. In the case of a perfect reflector, this pressure will be identical to the pressure caused by the incident wave:

formula_6

thus &quot;doubling&quot; the net radiation pressure on the surface:

formula_7

For a partially reflective surface, the second term must be multiplied by the reflectivity (also known as reflection coefficient of intensity), so that the increase is less than double. For a diffusely reflective surface, the details of the reflection and geometry must be taken into account, again resulting in an increased net radiation pressure of less than double.

=== Radiation pressure by emission ===
Just as a wave reflected from a body contributes to the net radiation pressure experienced, a body that emits radiation of its own (rather than reflected) obtains a radiation pressure again given by the irradiance of that emission &quot;in the direction normal to the surface&quot; &quot;I&quot;e:
formula_8

The emission can be from black-body radiation or any other radiative mechanism. Since all materials emit black-body radiation (unless they are totally reflective or at absolute zero), this source for radiation pressure is ubiquitous but usually tiny. However, because black-body radiation increases rapidly with temperature (as the fourth power of temperature, given by the Stefan–Boltzmann law), radiation pressure due to the temperature of a very hot object (or due to incoming black-body radiation from similarly hot surroundings) can become significant. This is important in stellar interiors.

=== Radiation pressure in terms of photons ===

Electromagnetic radiation can be viewed in terms of particles rather than waves; these particles are known as photons. Photons do not have a rest-mass; however, photons are never at rest (they move at the speed of light) and acquire a momentum nonetheless which is given by:
formula_9
where is momentum, is the Planck constant, is wavelength, and is speed of light in vacuum. And is the energy of a single photon given by: 
formula_10

The radiation pressure again can be seen as the transfer of each photon&#x27;s momentum to the opaque surface, plus the momentum due to a (possible) recoil photon for a (partially) reflecting surface. Since an incident wave of irradiance over an area has a power of , this implies a flux of photons per second per unit area striking the surface. Combining this with the above expression for the momentum of a single photon, results in the same relationships between irradiance and radiation pressure described above using classical electromagnetics. And again, reflected or otherwise emitted photons will contribute to the net radiation pressure identically.

=== Compression in a uniform radiation field ===

In general, the pressure of electromagnetic waves can be obtained from the vanishing of the trace of the electromagnetic stress tensor: since this trace equals 3&quot;P&quot; − &quot;u&quot;, we get
formula_11
where is the radiation energy per unit volume.

This can also be shown in the specific case of the pressure exerted on surfaces of a body in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, at a temperature : the body will be surrounded by a uniform radiation field described by the Planck black-body radiation law and will experience a compressive pressure due to that impinging radiation, its reflection, and its own black-body emission. From that it can be shown that the resulting pressure is equal to one third of the total radiant energy per unit volume in the surrounding space.

By using Stefan–Boltzmann law, this can be expressed as
formula_12
where formula_13 is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant.

== Solar radiation pressure ==

Solar radiation pressure is due to the Sun&#x27;s radiation at closer distances, thus especially within the Solar System. While it acts on all objects, its net effect is generally greater on smaller bodies, since they have a larger ratio of surface area to mass. All spacecraft experience such a pressure, except when they are behind the shadow of a larger orbiting body.

Solar radiation pressure on objects near the Earth may be calculated using the Sun&#x27;s irradiance at 1 AU, known as the solar constant, or &quot;G&quot;SC, whose value is set at 1361 W/m2 as of 2011.

All stars have a spectral energy distribution that depends on their surface temperature. The distribution is approximately that of black-body radiation. This distribution must be taken into account when calculating the radiation pressure or identifying reflector materials for optimizing a solar sail, for instance.

Momentary or hours long solar pressures can indeed escalate due to release of solar flares and coronal mass ejections, but effects remain essentially immeasureable in relation to Earth&#x27;s orbit. However these pressures persist over eons, such that cumulatively having produced a measureable movement on the Earth-Moon system&#x27;s orbit.

=== Pressures of absorption and reflection ===

Solar radiation pressure at the Earth&#x27;s distance from the Sun, may be calculated by dividing the solar constant &quot;G&quot;SC (above) by the speed of light &quot;c&quot;. For an absorbing sheet facing the Sun, this is simply:
formula_14

This result is in pascals, equivalent to N/m2 (newtons per square meter). For a sheet at an angle &quot;α&quot; to the Sun, the effective area &quot;A&quot; of a sheet is reduced by a geometrical factor resulting in a force &quot;in the direction of the sunlight&quot; of:
formula_15

To find the component of this force normal to the surface, another cosine factor must be applied resulting in a pressure &quot;P&quot; on the surface of:
formula_16

Note, however, that in order to account for the net effect of solar radiation on a spacecraft for instance, one would need to consider the &quot;total&quot; force (in the direction away from the Sun) given by the preceding equation, rather than just the component normal to the surface that we identify as &quot;pressure&quot;.

The solar constant is defined for the Sun&#x27;s radiation at the distance to the Earth, also known as one astronomical unit (au). Consequently, at a distance of &quot;R&quot; astronomical units (&quot;R&quot; thus being dimensionless), applying the inverse-square law, we would find:
formula_17

Finally, considering not an absorbing but a perfectly reflecting surface, the pressure is &quot;doubled&quot; due to the reflected wave, resulting in:
formula_18

Note that unlike the case of an absorbing material, the resulting force on a reflecting body is given exactly by this pressure acting normal to the surface, with the tangential forces from the incident and reflecting waves canceling each other. In practice, materials are neither totally reflecting nor totally absorbing, so the resulting force will be a weighted average of the forces calculated using these formulas.

=== Radiation pressure perturbations ===
Solar radiation pressure is a source of orbital perturbations. It significantly affects the orbits and trajectories of small bodies including all spacecraft.

Solar radiation pressure affects bodies throughout much of the Solar System. Small bodies are more affected than large ones because of their lower mass relative to their surface area. Spacecraft are affected along with natural bodies (comets, asteroids, dust grains, gas molecules).

The radiation pressure results in forces and torques on the bodies that can change their translational and rotational motions. Translational changes affect the orbits of the bodies. Rotational rates may increase or decrease. Loosely aggregated bodies may break apart under high rotation rates. Dust grains can either leave the Solar System or spiral into the Sun.

A whole body is typically composed of numerous surfaces that have different orientations on the body. The facets may be flat or curved. They will have different areas. They may have optical properties differing from other aspects.

At any particular time, some facets are exposed to the Sun, and some are in shadow. Each surface exposed to the Sun is reflecting, absorbing, and emitting radiation. Facets in shadow are emitting radiation. The summation of pressures across all of the facets defines the net force and torque on the body. These can be calculated using the equations in the preceding sections.

The Yarkovsky effect affects the translation of a small body. It results from a face leaving solar exposure being at a higher temperature than a face approaching solar exposure. The radiation emitted from the warmer face is more intense than that of the opposite face, resulting in a net force on the body that affects its motion.

The YORP effect is a collection of effects expanding upon the earlier concept of the Yarkovsky effect, but of a similar nature. It affects the spin properties of bodies.

The Poynting–Robertson effect applies to grain-size particles. From the perspective of a grain of dust circling the Sun, the Sun&#x27;s radiation appears to be coming from a slightly forward direction (aberration of light). Therefore, the absorption of this radiation leads to a force with a component against the direction of movement. (The angle of aberration is tiny, since the radiation is moving at the speed of light, while the dust grain is moving many orders of magnitude slower than that.) The result is a gradual spiral of dust grains into the Sun. Over long periods of time, this effect cleans out much of the dust in the Solar System.

While rather small in comparison to other forces, the radiation pressure force is inexorable. Over long periods of time, the net effect of the force is substantial. Such feeble pressures can produce marked effects upon minute particles like gas ions and electrons, and are essential in the theory of electron emission from the Sun, of cometary material, and so on.

Because the ratio of surface area to volume (and thus mass) increases with decreasing particle size, dusty (micrometre-size) particles are susceptible to radiation pressure even in the outer Solar System. For example, the evolution of the outer rings of Saturn is significantly influenced by radiation pressure.

As a consequence of light pressure, Einstein in 1909 predicted the existence of &quot;radiation friction&quot;, which would oppose the movement of matter. He wrote: &quot;radiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backward acting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant &#x27;radiation friction&#x27; in brief.&quot;

=== Solar sails ===

Solar sailing, an experimental method of spacecraft propulsion, uses radiation pressure from the Sun as a motive force. The idea of interplanetary travel by light was mentioned by Jules Verne in his 1865 novel &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;.

A sail reflects about 90% of the incident radiation. The 10% that is absorbed is radiated away from both surfaces, with the proportion emitted from the unlit surface depending on the thermal conductivity of the sail. A sail has curvature, surface irregularities, and other minor factors that affect its performance.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has successfully unfurled a solar sail in space, which has already succeeded in propelling its payload with the IKAROS project.

== Cosmic effects of radiation pressure ==

Radiation pressure has had a major effect on the development of the cosmos, from the birth of the universe to ongoing formation of stars and shaping of clouds of dust and gasses on a wide range of scales.

=== Early universe ===

The photon epoch is a phase when the energy of the universe was dominated by photons, between 10 seconds and 380,000 years after the Big Bang.

=== Galaxy formation and evolution ===
The process of galaxy formation and evolution began early in the history of the cosmos. Observations of the early universe strongly suggest that objects grew from bottom-up (i.e., smaller objects merging to form larger ones). As stars are thereby formed and become sources of electromagnetic radiation, radiation pressure from the stars becomes a factor in the dynamics of remaining circumstellar material.

=== Clouds of dust and gases ===
The gravitational compression of clouds of dust and gases is strongly influenced by radiation pressure, especially when the condensations lead to star births. The larger young stars forming within the compressed clouds emit intense levels of radiation that shift the clouds, causing either dispersion or condensations in nearby regions, which influences birth rates in those nearby regions.

=== Clusters of stars ===

Stars predominantly form in regions of large clouds of dust and gases, giving rise to star clusters. Radiation pressure from the member stars eventually disperses the clouds, which can have a profound effect on the evolution of the cluster.

Many open clusters are inherently unstable, with a small enough mass that the escape velocity of the system is lower than the average velocity of the constituent stars. These clusters will rapidly disperse within a few million years. In many cases, the stripping away of the gas from which the cluster formed by the radiation pressure of the hot young stars reduces the cluster mass enough to allow rapid dispersal.

=== Star formation ===

Star formation is the process by which dense regions within molecular clouds in interstellar space collapse to form stars. As a branch of astronomy, star formation includes the study of the interstellar medium and giant molecular clouds (GMC) as precursors to the star formation process, and the study of protostars and young stellar objects as its immediate products. Star formation theory, as well as accounting for the formation of a single star, must also account for the statistics of binary stars and the initial mass function.

=== Stellar planetary systems ===
Planetary systems are generally believed to form as part of the same process that results in star formation. A protoplanetary disk forms by gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud, called a solar nebula, and then evolves into a planetary system by collisions and gravitational capture. Radiation pressure can clear a region in the immediate vicinity of the star. As the formation process continues, radiation pressure continues to play a role in affecting the distribution of matter. In particular, dust and grains can spiral into the star or escape the stellar system under the action of radiation pressure.

=== Stellar interiors ===

In stellar interiors the temperatures are very high. Stellar models predict a temperature of 15 MK in the center of the Sun, and at the cores of supergiant stars the temperature may exceed 1 GK. As the radiation pressure scales as the fourth power of the temperature, it becomes important at these high temperatures. In the Sun, radiation pressure is still quite small when compared to the gas pressure. In the heaviest non-degenerate stars, radiation pressure is the dominant pressure component.

=== Comets ===
Solar radiation pressure strongly affects comet tails. Solar heating causes gases to be released from the comet nucleus, which also carry away dust grains. Radiation pressure and solar wind then drive the dust and gases away from the Sun&#x27;s direction. The gases form a generally straight tail, while slower moving dust particles create a broader, curving tail.

== Laser applications of radiation pressure ==

=== Optical tweezers ===

Lasers can be used as a source of monochromatic light with wavelength formula_19. With a set of lenses, one can focus the laser beam to a point that is formula_19 in diameter (or formula_21).

The radiation pressure of a &quot;P&quot; = 30 mW laser with &quot;λ&quot; = 1064 nm can therefore be computed as follows.

Area:
formula_22

force:
formula_23

pressure:
formula_24

This is used to trap or levitate particles in optical tweezers.

=== Light–matter interactions ===
The reflection of a laser pulse from the surface of an elastic solid can give rise to various types of elastic waves that propagate inside the solid or liquid. In other words, the light can excite and/or amplify motion of, and in, materials. This is the subject of study in the field of optomechanics. The weakest waves are generally those that are generated by the radiation pressure acting during the reflection of the light. Such light-pressure-induced elastic waves have for example observed inside an ultrahigh-reflectivity dielectric mirror. These waves are the most basic fingerprint of a light-solid matter interaction on the macroscopic scale. In the field of &quot;cavity&quot; optomechanics, light is trapped and resonantly enhanced in optical cavities, for example between mirrors. This serves the purpose of gravely enhancing the power of the light, and the radiation pressure it can exert on objects and materials. Optical control (that is, manipulation of the motion) of a plethora of objects has been realized: from kilometers long beams (such as in the LIGO interferometer) to clouds of atoms, and from micro-engineered trampolines to superfluids.
Opposite to exciting or amplifying motion, light can also damp the motion of objects. Laser cooling is a method of cooling materials very close to absolute zero by converting some of material&#x27;s motional energy into light. Kinetic energy and thermal energy of the material are synonyms here, because they represent the energy associated with Brownian motion of the material. Atoms traveling towards a laser light source perceive a doppler effect tuned to the absorption frequency of the target element. The radiation pressure on the atom slows movement in a particular direction until the Doppler effect moves out of the frequency range of the element, causing an overall cooling effect.

An other active research area of laser–matter interaction is the radiation pressure acceleration of ions or protons from thin–foil targets. High ion energy beams can be generated for medical applications (for example in ion beam therapy) by the radiation pressure of short laser pulses on ultra-thin foils.

<text>Silicon dioxide, also known as silica, is an oxide of silicon with the chemical formula , commonly found in nature as quartz. In many parts of the world, silica is the major constituent of sand. Silica is one of the most complex and abundant families of materials, existing as a compound of several minerals and as a synthetic product. Examples include fused quartz, fumed silica, opal, and aerogels. It is used in structural materials, microelectronics, and as components in the food and pharmaceutical industries. All forms are white or colorless, although impure samples can be colored.

Silicon dioxide is a common fundamental constituent of glass.

==Structure==

In the majority of silicon dioxides, the silicon atom shows tetrahedral coordination, with four oxygen atoms surrounding a central Si atom (see 3-D Unit Cell). Thus, SiO2 forms 3-dimensional network solids in which each silicon atom is covalently bonded in a tetrahedral manner to 4 oxygen atoms. In contrast, CO2 is a linear molecule. The starkly different structures of the dioxides of carbon and silicon are a manifestation of the double bond rule.

Based on the crystal structural differences, silicon dioxide can be divided into two categories: crystalline and non-crystalline (amorphous). In crystalline form, this substance can be found naturally occurring as quartz, tridymite (high-temperature form), cristobalite (high-temperature form), stishovite (high-pressure form), and coesite (high-pressure form). On the other hand, amorphous silica can be found in nature as opal and diatomaceous earth. Quartz glass is a form of intermediate state between these structures.

All of these distinct crystalline forms always have the same local structure around Si and O. In α-quartz the Si–O bond length is 161 pm, whereas in α-tridymite it is in the range 154–171 pm. The Si–O–Si angle also varies between a low value of 140° in α-tridymite, up to 180° in β-tridymite. In α-quartz, the Si–O–Si angle is 144°.

===Polymorphism===
Alpha quartz is the most stable form of solid SiO2 at room temperature. The high-temperature minerals, cristobalite and tridymite, have both lower densities and indices of refraction than quartz. The transformation from α-quartz to beta-quartz takes place abruptly at 573 °C. Since the transformation is accompanied by a significant change in volume, it can easily induce fracturing of ceramics or rocks passing through this temperature limit. The high-pressure minerals, seifertite, stishovite, and coesite, though, have higher densities and indices of refraction than quartz. Stishovite has a rutile-like structure where silicon is 6-coordinate. The density of stishovite is 4.287 g/cm3, which compares to α-quartz, the densest of the low-pressure forms, which has a density of 2.648 g/cm3. The difference in density can be ascribed to the increase in coordination as the six shortest Si–O bond lengths in stishovite (four Si–O bond lengths of 176 pm and two others of 181 pm) are greater than the Si–O bond length (161 pm) in α-quartz.
The change in the coordination increases the ionicity of the Si–O bond.

Faujasite silica, another polymorph, is obtained by the of a low-sodium, ultra-stable Y zeolite with combined acid and thermal treatment. The resulting product contains over 99% silica, and has high crystallinity and specific surface area (over 800 m2/g). Faujasite-silica has very high thermal and acid stability. For example, it maintains a high degree of long-range molecular order or crystallinity even after boiling in concentrated hydrochloric acid.

===Molten SiO2===
Molten silica exhibits several peculiar physical characteristics that are similar to those observed in liquid water: negative temperature expansion, density maximum at temperatures ~5000 °C, and a heat capacity minimum. Its density decreases from 2.08 g/cm3 at 1950 °C to 2.03 g/cm3 at 2200 °C.

===Molecular SiO2===
The molecular SiO2 has a linear structure like . It has been produced by combining silicon monoxide (SiO) with oxygen in an argon matrix. 
The dimeric silicon dioxide, (SiO2)2 has been obtained by reacting O2 with matrix isolated dimeric silicon monoxide, (Si2O2). In dimeric silicon dioxide there are two oxygen atoms bridging between the silicon atoms with an Si–O–Si angle of 94° and bond length of 164.6 pm and the terminal Si–O bond length is 150.2 pm. The Si–O bond length is 148.3 pm, which compares with the length of 161 pm in α-quartz. The bond energy is estimated at 621.7 kJ/mol.

==Natural occurrence==
===Geology===

 is most commonly encountered in nature as quartz, which comprises more than 10% by mass of the Earth&#x27;s crust. Quartz is the only polymorph of silica stable at the Earth&#x27;s surface. Metastable occurrences of the high-pressure forms coesite and stishovite have been found around impact structures and associated with eclogites formed during ultra-high-pressure metamorphism. The high-temperature forms of tridymite and cristobalite are known from silica-rich volcanic rocks. In many parts of the world, silica is the major constituent of sand.

===Biology===
Even though it is poorly soluble, silica occurs in many plants such as rice. Plant materials with high silica phytolith content appear to be of importance to grazing animals, from chewing insects to ungulates. Silica accelerates tooth wear, and high levels of silica in plants frequently eaten by herbivores may have developed as a defense mechanism against predation.

Silica is also the primary component of rice husk ash, which is used, for example, in filtration and as supplementary cementitious material (SCM) in cement and concrete manufacturing.

Silicification in and by cells has been common in the biological world and it occurs in bacteria, protists, plants, and animals (invertebrates and vertebrates).

Prominent examples include:
*Tests or frustules (i.e. shells) of diatoms, Radiolaria, and testate amoebae.
*Silica phytoliths in the cells of many plants including Equisetaceae, many grasses, and a wide range of dicotyledons.
*The spicules forming the skeleton of many sponges.

==Uses==
===Structural use===
About 95% of the commercial use of silicon dioxide (sand) is in the construction industry, e.g. in the production of concrete (Portland cement concrete).

Certain deposits of silica sand, with desirable particle size and shape and desirable clay and other mineral content, were important for sand casting of metallic products. The high melting point of silica enables it to be used in such applications such as iron casting; modern sand casting sometimes uses other minerals for other reasons.

Crystalline silica is used in hydraulic fracturing of formations which contain tight oil and shale gas.

===Precursor to glass and silicon===
Silica is the primary ingredient in the production of most glass. As other minerals are melted with silica, the principle of freezing point depression lowers the melting point of the mixture and increases fluidity. The glass transition temperature of pure SiO2 is about 1475 K. When molten silicon dioxide SiO2 is rapidly cooled, it does not crystallize, but solidifies as a glass. Because of this, most ceramic glazes have silica as the main ingredient.

The structural geometry of silicon and oxygen in glass is similar to that in quartz and most other crystalline forms of silicon and oxygen, with silicon surrounded by regular tetrahedra of oxygen centres. The difference between the glass and crystalline forms arises from the connectivity of the tetrahedral units: Although there is no long-range periodicity in the glassy network, ordering remains at length scales well beyond the SiO bond length. One example of this ordering is the preference to form rings of 6-tetrahedra.

The majority of optical fibers for telecommunications are also made from silica. It is a primary raw material for many ceramics such as earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain.

Silicon dioxide is used to produce elemental silicon. The process involves carbothermic reduction in an electric arc furnace:
:&lt;chem&gt;SiO2 + 2 C -&gt; Si + 2 CO&lt;/chem&gt;

===Fumed silica===
Fumed silica, also known as pyrogenic silica, is prepared by burning SiCl4 in an oxygen-rich hydrogen flame to produce a &quot;smoke&quot; of SiO2. 
:&lt;chem&gt;SiCl4 + 2 H2 + O2 -&gt; SiO2 + 4 HCl&lt;/chem&gt;
It can also be produced by vaporizing quartz sand in a 3000 °C electric arc. Both processes result in microscopic droplets of amorphous silica fused into branched, chainlike, three-dimensional secondary particles which then agglomerate into tertiary particles, a white powder with extremely low bulk density (0.03-0.15 g/cm3) and thus high surface area. The particles act as a thixotropic thickening agent, or as an anti-caking agent, and can be treated to make them hydrophilic or hydrophobic for either water or organic liquid applications.
Silica fume is an ultrafine powder collected as a by-product of the silicon and ferrosilicon alloy production. It consists of amorphous (non-crystalline) spherical particles with an average particle diameter of 150 nm, without the branching of the pyrogenic product. The main use is as pozzolanic material for high performance concrete. Fumed silica nanoparticles can be successfully used as an anti-aging agent in asphalt binders.

===Food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical applications===
Silica, either colloidal, precipitated, or pyrogenic fumed, is a common additive in food production. It is used primarily as a flow or anti-caking agent in powdered foods such as spices and non-dairy coffee creamer, or powders to be formed into pharmaceutical tablets. It can adsorb water in hygroscopic applications. Colloidal silica is used as a fining agent for wine, beer, and juice, with the E number reference E551.

In cosmetics, silica is useful for its light-diffusing properties and natural absorbency.

Diatomaceous earth, a mined product, has been used in food and cosmetics for centuries. It consists of the silica shells of microscopic diatoms; in a less processed form it was sold as tooth powder. Manufactured or mined hydrated silica is used as the hard abrasive in toothpaste.

===Semiconductors===
Silicon dioxide is widely used in the semiconductor technology:

* for the primary passivation (directly on the semiconductor surface),
* as an original gate dielectric in MOS technology. Today when scaling (dimension of the gate length of the MOS transistor) has progressed below 10 nm, silicon dioxide has been replaced by other dielectric materials like hafnium oxide or similar with higher dielectric constant compared to silicon dioxide,
* as a dielectric layer between metal (wiring) layers (sometimes up to 8–10) connecting elements and
* as a second passivation layer (for protecting semiconductor elements and the metallization layers) typically today layered with some other dielectrics like silicon nitride.

Because silicon dioxide is a native oxide of silicon it is more widely used compared to other semiconductors like gallium arsenide or indium phosphide.

Silicon dioxide could be grown on a silicon semiconductor surface. Silicon oxide layers could protect silicon surfaces during diffusion processes, and could be used for diffusion masking.

Surface passivation is the process by which a semiconductor surface is rendered inert, and does not change semiconductor properties as a result of interaction with air or other materials in contact with the surface or edge of the crystal. The formation of a thermally grown silicon dioxide layer greatly reduces the concentration of electronic states at the silicon surface. SiO2 films preserve the electrical characteristics of p–n junctions and prevent these electrical characteristics from deteriorating by the gaseous ambient environment. Silicon oxide layers could be used to electrically stabilize silicon surfaces. The surface passivation process is an important method of semiconductor device fabrication that involves coating a silicon wafer with an insulating layer of silicon oxide so that electricity could reliably penetrate to the conducting silicon below. Growing a layer of silicon dioxide on top of a silicon wafer enables it to overcome the surface states that otherwise prevent electricity from reaching the semiconducting layer.

The process of silicon surface passivation by thermal oxidation (silicon dioxide) is critical to the semiconductor industry. It is commonly used to manufacture metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) and silicon integrated circuit chips (with the planar process).

===Other===
Hydrophobic silica is used as a defoamer component.

In its capacity as a refractory, it is useful in fiber form as a high-temperature thermal protection fabric.

Silica is used in the extraction of DNA and RNA due to its ability to bind to the nucleic acids under the presence of chaotropes.

Silica aerogel was used in the Stardust spacecraft to collect extraterrestrial particles.

Pure silica (silicon dioxide), when cooled as fused quartz into a glass with no true melting point, can be used as a glass fibre for fibreglass.

==Production==
Silicon dioxide is mostly obtained by mining, including sand mining and purification of quartz. 
Quartz is suitable for many purposes, while chemical processing is required to make a purer or otherwise more suitable (e.g. more reactive or fine-grained) product.

===Precipitated silica===
Precipitated silica or amorphous silica is produced by the acidification of solutions of sodium silicate. The gelatinous precipitate or silica gel, is first washed and then dehydrated to produce colorless microporous silica. The idealized equation involving a trisilicate and sulfuric acid is:
:&lt;chem&gt;Na2Si3O7 + H2SO4 -&gt; 3 SiO2 + Na2SO4 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

Approximately one billion kilograms/year (1999) of silica were produced in this manner, mainly for use for polymer composites – tires and shoe soles.

===On microchips===
Thin films of silica grow spontaneously on silicon wafers via thermal oxidation, producing a very shallow layer of about 1 nm or 10 Å of so-called native oxide.
Higher temperatures and alternative environments are used to grow well-controlled layers of silicon dioxide on silicon, for example at temperatures between 600 and 1200 °C, using so-called dry oxidation with O2
:&lt;chem&gt;Si + O2 -&gt; SiO2&lt;/chem&gt;

or wet oxidation with H2O.
:&lt;chem&gt;Si + 2 H2O -&gt; SiO2 + 2 H2&lt;/chem&gt;

The native oxide layer is beneficial in microelectronics, where it acts as electric insulator with high chemical stability. It can protect the silicon, store charge, block current, and even act as a controlled pathway to limit current flow.

===Laboratory or special methods===
==== From organosilicon compounds ====
Many routes to silicon dioxide start with an organosilicon compound, e.g., HMDSO, TEOS. Synthesis of silica is illustrated below using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). Simply heating TEOS at 680–730 °C results in the oxide:

:&lt;chem&gt;Si(OC2H5)4 -&gt; SiO2 + 2 O(C2H5)2&lt;/chem&gt;

Similarly TEOS combusts around 400 °C:

:&lt;chem&gt;Si(OC2H5)4 + 12 O2 -&gt; SiO2 + 10 H2O + 8 CO2&lt;/chem&gt;

TEOS undergoes hydrolysis via the so-called sol-gel process. The course of the reaction and nature of the product are affected by catalysts, but the idealized equation is:

:&lt;chem&gt;Si(OC2H5)4 + 2 H2O -&gt; SiO2 + 4 HOCH2CH3&lt;/chem&gt;

====Other methods====
Being highly stable, silicon dioxide arises from many methods. Conceptually simple, but of little practical value, combustion of silane gives silicon dioxide. This reaction is analogous to the combustion of methane:

:&lt;chem&gt;SiH4 + 2 O2 -&gt; SiO2 + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

However the chemical vapor deposition of silicon dioxide onto crystal surface from silane had been used using nitrogen as a carrier gas at 200–500 °C.

==Chemical reactions==
Silicon dioxide is a relatively inert material (hence its widespread occurrence as a mineral). Silica is often used as inert containers for chemical reactions. At high temperatures, it is converted to silicon by reduction with carbon.

Fluorine reacts with silicon dioxide to form SiF4 and O2 whereas the other halogen gases (Cl2, Br2, I2) are unreactive.

Most forms of silicon dioxide are attacked (&quot;etched&quot;) by hydrofluoric acid (HF) to produce hexafluorosilicic acid:
Stishovite does not react to HF to any significant degree. 
HF is used to remove or pattern silicon dioxide in the semiconductor industry.

Silicon dioxide acts as a Lux–Flood acid, being able to react with bases under certain conditions. As it does not contain any hydrogen, non-hydrated silica cannot directly act as a Brønsted–Lowry acid. While silicon dioxide is only poorly soluble in water at low or neutral pH (typically, 2 × 10−4 M for quartz up to 10−3 M for cryptocrystalline chalcedony), strong bases react with glass and easily dissolve it. Therefore, strong bases have to be stored in plastic bottles to avoid jamming the bottle cap, to preserve the integrity of the recipient, and to avoid undesirable contamination by silicate anions.

Silicon dioxide dissolves in hot concentrated alkali or fused hydroxide, as described in this idealized equation:
:&lt;chem&gt;SiO2 + 2 NaOH -&gt; Na2SiO3 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

Silicon dioxide will neutralise basic metal oxides (e.g. sodium oxide, potassium oxide, lead(II) oxide, zinc oxide, or mixtures of oxides, forming silicates and glasses as the Si-O-Si bonds in silica are broken successively). As an example the reaction of sodium oxide and SiO2 can produce sodium orthosilicate, sodium silicate, and glasses, dependent on the proportions of reactants:
:&lt;chem&gt;2 Na2O + SiO2 -&gt; Na4SiO4;&lt;/chem&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;Na2O + SiO2 -&gt; Na2SiO3;&lt;/chem&gt;

:formula_1 &lt;chem&gt;Na2O + SiO2 -&gt; glass&lt;/chem&gt;.

Examples of such glasses have commercial significance, e.g. soda–lime glass, borosilicate glass, lead glass. In these glasses, silica is termed the network former or lattice former. The reaction is also used in blast furnaces to remove sand impurities in the ore by neutralisation with calcium oxide, forming calcium silicate slag.
Silicon dioxide reacts in heated reflux under dinitrogen with ethylene glycol and an alkali metal base to produce highly reactive, pentacoordinate silicates which provide access to a wide variety of new silicon compounds. The silicates are essentially insoluble in all polar solvent except methanol.

Silicon dioxide reacts with elemental silicon at high temperatures to produce SiO:
:&lt;chem&gt;SiO2 + Si -&gt; 2 SiO&lt;/chem&gt;

===Water solubility===
The solubility of silicon dioxide in water strongly depends on its crystalline form and is three to four times higher for amorphous silica than quartz; as a function of temperature, it peaks around . This property is used to grow single crystals of quartz in a hydrothermal process where natural quartz is dissolved in superheated water in a pressure vessel that is cooler at the top. Crystals of 0.5–1  kg can be grown for 1–2 months. These crystals are a source of very pure quartz for use in electronic applications. Above the critical temperature of water and a pressure of or higher, water is a supercritical fluid and solubility is once again higher than at lower temperatures.

==Health effects==

Silica ingested orally is essentially nontoxic, with an of 5000 mg/kg (5 g/kg). A 2008 study following subjects for 15 years found that higher levels of silica in water appeared to decrease the risk of dementia. An increase of 10 mg/day of silica in drinking water was associated with a reduced risk of dementia of 11%.

Inhaling finely divided crystalline silica dust can lead to silicosis, bronchitis, or lung cancer, as the dust becomes lodged in the lungs and continuously irritates the tissue, reducing lung capacities. When fine silica particles are inhaled in large enough quantities (such as through occupational exposure), it increases the risk of systemic autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis compared to expected rates in the general population.

===Occupational hazard===
Silica is an occupational hazard for people who do sandblasting or work with powdered crystalline silica products. Amorphous silica, such as fumed silica, may cause irreversible lung damage in some cases but is not associated with the development of silicosis. Children, asthmatics of any age, those with allergies, and the elderly (all of whom have reduced lung capacity) can be affected in less time.

Crystalline silica is an occupational hazard for those working with stone countertops because the process of cutting and installing the countertops creates large amounts of airborne silica. Crystalline silica used in hydraulic fracturing presents a health hazard to workers.

===Pathophysiology===
In the body, crystalline silica particles do not dissolve over clinically relevant periods. Silica crystals inside the lungs can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome inside macrophages and dendritic cells and thereby result in production of interleukin, a highly pro-inflammatory cytokine in the immune system.

===Regulation===
Regulations restricting silica exposure &#x27;with respect to the silicosis hazard&#x27; specify that they are concerned only with silica, which is both crystalline and dust-forming.

In 2013, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration reduced the exposure limit to 50 μg/m3 of air. Prior to 2013, it had allowed 100 μg/m3 and in construction workers even 250 μg/m3.
In 2013, OSHA also required the &quot;green completion&quot; of fracked wells to reduce exposure to crystalline silica and restrict the exposure limit.

==Crystalline forms==
SiO2, more so than almost any material, exists in many crystalline forms. These forms are called polymorphs.
==Safety==
Inhaling finely divided crystalline silica can lead to severe inflammation of the lung tissue, silicosis, bronchitis, lung cancer, and systemic autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Inhalation of amorphous silicon dioxide, in high doses, leads to non-permanent short-term inflammation, where all effects heal.

<text>A Nichols radiometer was the apparatus used by Ernest Fox Nichols and Gordon Ferrie Hull in 1901 for the measurement of radiation pressure. 

It consisted of a pair of small silvered glass mirrors suspended in the manner of a torsion balance by a fine quartz fibre within an enclosure in which the air pressure could be regulated. The torsion head to which the fiber was attached could be turned from the outside using a magnet. A beam of light was directed first on one mirror and then on the other, and the opposite deflections observed with mirror and scale. By turning the mirror system around to receive the light on the unsilvered side, the influence of the air in the enclosure could be ascertained. This influence was found to be of almost negligible value at an air pressure of about . The radiant energy of the incident beam was deduced from its heating effect upon a small blackened silver disk, which was found to be more reliable than the bolometer when it was first used. With this apparatus, the experimenters were able to obtain an agreement between observed and computed radiation pressures within about 0.6%.

The original apparatus is at the Smithsonian Institution.

This apparatus is sometimes confused with the Crookes radiometer of 1873.

The original papers, with their historical context, have been re-printed in a chapter of the book &quot;Quantum Photonics: Pioneering Advances and Emerging Applications&quot;.

<doc id="43712" wikidata="Q200263" url="?curid=43712" title="Parsis">
<text>The Parsis or Parsees () are a Zoroastrian community in the Indian subcontinent. They are descended from Persian refugees who migrated to the Indian subcontinent during and after the Arab-Islamic conquest of Iran in the 7th century, when Zoroastrians were persecuted by the early Muslims. Representing the elder of the Indian subcontinent&#x27;s two Zoroastrian communities, the Parsi people are culturally, linguistically, and socially distinct from the Iranis, whose Zoroastrian ancestors migrated to British-ruled India from Qajar-era Iran. The word &quot;Parsi&quot; is derived from the Persian language, and literally translates to &quot;Persian&quot; ().

According to the 16th-century Parsi epic &quot;Qissa-i Sanjan&quot;, the immigration of Zoroastrian Persians to the Indian subcontinent from Greater Iran continued between the 8th century and the 10th century. The earliest of these migrants settled among the Hindus of present-day Gujarat after being granted refuge by Jadi Rana, the king of Sanjan.

Zoroastrianism had served as Iran&#x27;s state religion since at least the time of the Achaemenid Empire. However, the conquest of the Sasanian Empire by the Rashidun Caliphate marked the beginning of the Islamisation of Iran, which prompted much of the Zoroastrian-majority population to either convert to Islam or flee, though a number of Iranian figures stayed in active revolt against the Rashidun army and the later Islamic caliphates for almost 200 years after the collapse of the Sasanian Empire. Nevertheless, Zoroastrianism continued to decline, and most Iranians had become Muslims by the 10th century, shifting the concentration of the religion&#x27;s followers away from the Iranian plateau for the first time in recorded history.

The Gujarati-speaking Parsi community accounts for the oldest sustained presence of Zoroastrianism in India, and is legally differentiated from the Dari-speaking Irani community on the basis of the era of their migration to the country. Despite this legal distinction, the terms &quot;Parsi&quot; and &quot;Zoroastrian&quot; are commonly utilised interchangeably to denote both communities, which make up the world&#x27;s largest Zoroastrian population. Notably, no substantial differences exist between Parsi and Irani religious principles, convictions, and customs.

== Definition and identity ==
According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;,Parsi, also spelled Parsee, member of a group of followers in India of the Persian prophet Zoroaster. The Parsis, whose name means &quot;Persians&quot;, are descended from Persian Zoroastrians who emigrated to India to avoid religious persecution by the Muslims. They live chiefly in Mumbai and in a few towns and villages mostly to the south of Mumbai, but also a few minorities nearby in Karachi (Pakistan) and Chennai. There is a sizeable Parsee population in Pune as well in Bangalore. A few Parsee families also reside in Kolkata and Hyderabad. Although they are not, strictly speaking, a caste, since they are not Hindus, they form a well-defined community. The exact date of the Parsi migration is unknown. According to tradition, the Parsis initially settled at Hormuz on the Persian Gulf but finding themselves still persecuted they set sail for India, arriving in the 8th century. The migration may, in fact, have taken place as late as the 10th century, or in both. They settled first at Diu in Kathiawar but soon moved to South Gujarāt, where they remained for about 800 years as a small agricultural community.

The term &quot;Pārsi&quot;, which in the Persian language is a demonym meaning &quot;inhabitant of Pārs&quot; and hence &quot;ethnic Persian&quot;, is not attested in Indian Zoroastrian texts until the 17th century. Until that time, such texts consistently use the Persian-origin terms &quot;Zartoshti&quot; &quot;Zoroastrian&quot; or &quot;Vehdin&quot; &quot;[of] the good religion&quot;. The 12th-century &quot;Sixteen Shlokas&quot;, a Sanskrit text in praise of the Parsis, is the earliest attested use of the term as an identifier for Indian Zoroastrians.
The first reference to the Parsis in a European language is from 1322, when a French monk, Jordanus, briefly refers to their presence in Thane and Bharuch. Subsequently, the term appears in the journals of many European travelers, first French and Portuguese, later English, all of whom used a Europeanized version of an apparently local language term. For example, Portuguese physician Garcia de Orta observed in 1563 that &quot;there are merchants ... in the kingdom of Cambaia ... known as Esparcis. We Portuguese call them Jews, but they are not so. They are Gentios.&quot; In an early 20th-century legal ruling (see self-perceptions, below), Justices Davar and Beaman asserted (1909:540) that &quot;Parsi&quot; was also a term used in Iran to refer to Zoroastrians. notes that in much the same way as the word &quot;Hindu&quot; was used by Iranians to refer to anyone from the Indian subcontinent, &quot;Parsi&quot; was used by the Indians to refer to anyone from Greater Iran, irrespective of whether they were actually ethnic Persian people. In any case, the term &quot;Parsi&quot; itself is &quot;not necessarily an indication of their Iranian or &#x27;Persian&#x27; origin, but rather as indicator – manifest as several properties – of ethnic identity&quot;. Moreover, if heredity were the only factor in a determination of ethnicity, the Parsis would count as Parthians according to the &quot;Qissa-i Sanjan&quot;.

The term &quot;Parseeism&quot; or &quot;Parsiism&quot;, is attributed to Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron, who in the 1750s, when the word &quot;Zoroastrianism&quot; had yet to be coined, made the first detailed report of the Parsis and of Zoroastrianism, therein mistakenly assuming that the Parsis were the only remaining followers of the religion.

In addition to above, the term &quot;Parsi&quot; (Persian) existed even before they moved to India:
* The earliest reference to the Persians is found in the Assyrian inscription of Shalmaneser III (-824 BC).
* Darius the Great (521-486 BC) establishes this fact when he records his Parsi ancestry for posterity, &quot;parsa parsahya puthra ariya ariyachitra&quot;, meaning, &quot;a Persian, the son of a Persian, an Aryan, of Aryan family&quot; (Inscription at Naqsh-i-Rustam, near Persepolis, Iran).
* In Outlines of Persian History, Dasturji Hormazdyar Dastur Kayoji Mirza, Bombay 1987, pp. 3–4 writes, &quot;According to the Pahlavi text of Karnamak i Artakhshir i Papakan, the Indian astrologer refers to Artakhshir (Sasanian king, and the founder of the Empire) as khvatay parsikan &#x27;the king of the Persians&#x27;.
* Herodotus and Xenophon, the two great historians who lived in the third and fourth centuries BC, referred to Iranians as Persians.

== Origin ==
In ancient Persia, Zoroaster taught that good (Ohrmazd) and evil (Angra Mainyu) were opposite forces and the battle between them is more or less evenly matched. A person should always be vigilant to align with forces of light. According to the &quot;asha&quot; or the righteousness and &quot;druj&quot; or the wickedness, the person has chosen in their life they will be judged at the Chinvat bridge to grant passage to Paradise, Hammistagan (A limbo area) or Hell by the bridge remaining wide for a righteous soul and turning narrow as a sword for the wicked. A personified form of the soul that represents the person&#x27;s deeds takes the adjudged to their destination and they will abide there until the final apocalypse. After the final battle between good and evil, every soul&#x27;s walk through a river of fire ordeal for burning of their dross and together they receive a post resurrection paradise. The Zoroastrian holy book, called the &quot;Avesta&quot;, was written in the Avestan language, which is closely related to Vedic Sanskrit.

The &quot;Qissa-i Sanjan&quot; is a tale of the journey of the Parsis to India from Iran. It says they fled for reasons of religious freedom and they were allowed to settle in India thanks to the goodwill of a local prince. However, the Parsi community had to abide by three rules: they had to speak the local language, follow local marriage customs, and not carry any weapons. After showing the many similarities between their faith and local beliefs, the early community was granted a plot of land on which to build a fire temple.
=== As an ethnic community ===

Over the centuries since the first Zoroastrians arrived in India, the Parsis have integrated themselves into Indian society while simultaneously maintaining or developing their own distinct customs and traditions (and thus ethnic identity). This in turn has given the Parsi community a rather peculiar standing: they are mostly Indians in terms of national affiliation, language and history, but not typically Indian in terms of consanguinity or ethnicity, cultural, behavioural and religious practices. 

=== Self-perceptions ===

The definition of who is, and is not, a Parsi is a matter of great contention within the Zoroastrian community in India. It is generally accepted that a Parsi is a person who:

:(a) is directly descended from the original Persian refugees, and
:(b) has been formally admitted into the Zoroastrian religion, through the navjote ceremony.

In this sense, &quot;Parsi&quot; is an ethno-religious designator, whose definition is of contention among its members, similar to the identity question among Jews.

Some members of the community additionally contend that a child must have a Parsi father to be eligible for introduction into the faith, but this assertion is considered by most to be a violation of the Zoroastrian tenets of gender equality and may be a remnant of an old legal definition of the term Parsi.

An oft-quoted legal definition of Parsi is based on a 1909 ruling (since nullified) that not only stipulated that a person could not become a Parsi by converting to the Zoroastrian faith but also noted:

This definition was overturned several times. The equality principles of the Indian Constitution void the patrilineal restrictions expressed in the third clause. The second clause was contested and overturned in 1948. On appeal in 1950, the 1948 ruling was upheld and the entire 1909 definition was deemed an obiter dictum – a collateral opinion and not legally binding (re-affirmed in 1966).)

== Population ==


According to the 2011 census of India, there are 57,264 Parsis in India. According to the National Commission for Minorities, there are a &quot;variety of causes that are responsible for this steady decline in the population of the community&quot;, the most significant of which were childlessness and migration.

If Demographic trends project that by 2020 the Parsis will number only 23,000. The Parsis will then cease to be called a community and will be labeled a &#x27;tribe&#x27;.

One-fifth of the decrease in population is attributed to migration. There are sizeable Parsi communities in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and the United States. A slower birthrate than deathrate accounts for the rest: as of 2001, Parsis over the age of 60 make up for 31% of the community. Only 4.7% of the Parsi community are under 6 years of age, which translates to 7 births per year per 1000 individuals. Concerns have been raised in recent years over the rapidly declining population of the Parsi community in India.

===Ties to modern-day Iran===
Parsis have also been migrating to the traditional homeland of Iran and while the number of Parsis who have returned to Iran is small compared to the overall Zoroastrian community in Iran, their presence has helped to strengthen the ties between the Iranian and Indian Zoroastrian communities. The Parsis played a significant role in the modernization of Iran, particularly in the 20th century. They served as a reminder of Iran&#x27;s ancient heritage, which was crucial to Iranians. The Parsis also demonstrated to Iranians that it was possible to be both modern and culturally authentic, and that the revival of Zoroastrianism could be a way of modernizing Iranian culture while retaining its original identity.

Both Reza Shah and Muhammad Reza Shah played an active role in encouraging Parsis to invest in Iran and contribute to its economic development by inviting them to return to their homeland. During the Pahlavi dynasty in Iran, the relationship between Zoroastrianism and Iranian national identity was blurred. This was exemplified by Reza Shah&#x27;s adoption of Zoroastrian calendar names and placement of the Fravahar symbol on prominent government buildings. Additionally, he maintained a close relationship with the Zoroastrian parliamentary representative, Keikhosrow Shahrokh, who was entrusted by him with important governmental tasks.

Reza Shah was also sympathetic to Indian Zoroastrians (Parsis) and actively encouraged their return to Iran to invest and help develop the country&#x27;s economy. In 1932, he invited Dinshah Irani, a Parsi leader and founder of the Iranian Zoroastrian Anjoman and the Iran League in India, to visit Iran as part of a Parsi delegation. Irani was awarded honors by Reza Shah and entrusted with a message to take back to the Parsi community in India.&quot;You Parsis are as much the children of this soil as any other Iranis, and so you are as much entitled to have your proper share in its development as any other nationals.&quot;

&quot;We estimate Our Empire&#x27;s resources to be even greater than those of America, and in tapping them you can take your proper part. We do not want you to come all bag and baggage; just wait a little and watch.&quot;

&quot;If you find the proposition beneficial both to yourselves and to this land, then do come and We shall greet you with open arms, as We might.&quot;

&quot;Our dear brothers and sisters.&quot;

&quot;Iran is a vast country pregnant with many advantages and fresh fields waiting for development. We suggest that the Parsis, who are still the sons of Iran, though separated from her, should look upon this country of to-day as their own, and differentiate it from its immediate past, and strive to derive benefit from her developments.&quot;In the 1930s, Parsis discussed the idea of buying land in Iran to create a Parsi colony. Sir Hormusji C. Adenwala proposed raising funds in Bombay for this purpose, with support from the Iranian government and Reza Shah. Some Parsis had already resettled in Iran earlier since the time of Maneckji Hataria. The Iran League Quarterly provided information on legal and economic aspects of land purchase. Land near Bandar-e Shapur was suggested as particularly valuable due to government plans for the port. Similar plans were considered for other Parsi colonies in Iran, including Yazd and Kerman. Textile manufacturing was seen as a potential area for Parsi investment, leading to the establishment of the Khorsovi Textile Mill in Mashhad (based on joint Parsi and Iranian ownership agreements). There was also discussion of combining industrial and agricultural ventures in such colonies.

=== Other demographic statistics ===
The gender ratio among Parsis is unusual: as of 2001, the ratio of males to females was 1000 males to 1050 females (up from 1024 in 1991), due primarily to the high median age of the population (elderly women are more common than elderly men). As of 2001 the national average in India was 1000 males to 933 females.

Parsis have a high literacy rate; as of 2001, the literacy rate is 99.1%, the highest of any Indian community (the national average was 78.5%). 97.1% of Parsis reside in urban areas (the national average is 27.8%). Parsis mother tongue is Gujarati.
In the Greater Mumbai area, where the density of Parsis is highest, about 13% of Parsi females and about 24% of Parsi males do not marry.

== History ==
=== Arrival in the Indian subcontinent ===
According to the Qissa-i Sanjan, the only existing account of the early years of Zoroastrian refugees in India composed at least six centuries after their tentative date of arrival, the first group of immigrants originated from Greater Khorasan. This historical region of Central Asia is in part in northeastern Iran, where it constitutes modern Khorasan province, part of western/northern Afghanistan, and in part in three Central-Asian republics namely Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

According to the &quot;Qissa&quot;, the immigrants were granted permission to stay by the local ruler, Jadi Rana, on the condition that they adopt the local language (Gujarati) and that their women adopt local dress (the &quot;sari&quot;). The refugees accepted the conditions and founded the settlement of Sanjan, which is said to have been named after the city of their origin (Sanjan, near Merv, modern Turkmenistan). This first group was followed by a second group from Greater Khorasan within five years of the first, and this time having religious implements with them (the &quot;alat&quot;). In addition to these &quot;Khorasani&quot;s or &quot;Kohistani&quot;s &quot;mountain folk&quot;, as the two initial groups are said to have been initially called, at least one other group is said to have come overland from Sari, Iran.
Although the Sanjan group are believed to have been the first permanent settlers, the precise date of their arrival is a matter of conjecture. All estimates are based on the &quot;Qissa&quot;, which is vague or contradictory with respect to some elapsed periods. Consequently, three possible dates – 716, 765, and 936 – have been proposed as the year of landing, and the disagreement has been the cause of &quot;many an intense battle ... amongst Parsis&quot;. Since dates are not specifically mentioned in Parsi texts prior to the 18th century, any date of arrival is perforce a matter of speculation. The importance of the &quot;Qissa&quot; lies in any case not so much in its reconstruction of events than in its depiction of the Parsis – in the way they have come to view themselves – and in their relationship to the dominant culture. As such, the text plays a crucial role in shaping Parsi identity. But, &quot;even if one comes to the conclusion that the chronicle based on verbal transmission is not more than a legend, it still remains without doubt an extremely informative document for Parsee historiography.&quot;

The Sanjan Zoroastrians were certainly not the first Zoroastrians on the subcontinent. Sindh touching Balochistan, the easternmost periphery of the Iranian world, too had once been under coastal administration of the Sasanian Empire (226-651), which consequently maintained outposts there. Even following the loss of Sindh, the Iranians continued to play a major role in the trade links between the east and west. The 9th-century Arab historiographer Al-Masudi briefly notes Zoroastrians with fire temples in al-Hind and in al-Sindh. There is evidence of individual Parsis residing in Sindh in the tenth and twelfth centuries, but the current modern community is thought to date from British arrival in Sindh. Moreover, for the Iranians, the harbours of Gujarat lay on the maritime routes that complemented the overland Silk Road and there were extensive trade relations between the two regions. The contact between Iranians and Indians was already well established even prior to the Common Era, and both the Puranas and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; use the term &quot;Parasikas&quot; to refer to the peoples west of the Indus River.

&quot;Parsi legends regarding their ancestors&#x27; migration to India depict a beleaguered band of religious refugees escaping the new rule post the Muslim conquests in order to preserve their ancient faith.&quot; However, while Parsi settlements definitely arose along the western coast of the Indian subcontinent following the Arab conquest of Iran, it is not possible to state with certainty that these migrations occurred as a result of religious persecution against Zoroastrians. If the &quot;traditional&quot; 8th century date (as deduced from the &quot;Qissa&quot;) is considered valid, it must be assumed &quot;that the migration began while Zoroastrianism was still the predominant religion in Iran and economic factors predominated the initial decision to migrate.&quot; This would have been particularly the case if – as the &quot;Qissa&quot; suggests – the first Parsis originally came from the north-east (i.e. Central Asia) and had previously been dependent on Silk Road trade. Even so, in the 17th century, Henry Lord, a chaplain with the English East India Company, noted that the Parsis came to India seeking &quot;liberty of conscience&quot; but simultaneously arrived as &quot;merchantmen bound for the shores of India, in course of trade and merchandise.&quot;

=== Early years ===
The &quot;Qissa&quot; has little to say about the events that followed the establishment of Sanjan, and restricts itself to a brief note on the establishment of the &quot;Fire of Victory&quot; (Middle Persian: &quot;Atash Bahram&quot;) at Sanjan and its subsequent move to Navsari. According to Dhalla, the next several centuries were &quot;full of hardships&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;) before Zoroastrianism &quot;gained a real foothold in India and secured for its adherents some means of livelihood in this new country of their adoption&quot;.

Two centuries after their landing, the Parsis began to settle in other parts of Gujarat, which led to &quot;difficulties in defining the limits of priestly jurisdiction&quot;. These problems were resolved by 1290 through the division of Gujarat into five &quot;panthak&quot;s (districts), each under the jurisdiction of one priestly family and their descendants. (Continuing disputes regarding jurisdiction over the &quot;Atash Bahram&quot; led to the fire being moved to Udvada in 1742, where today jurisdiction is shared in rotation among the five &quot;panthak&quot; families.)

Inscriptions at the Kanheri Caves near Mumbai suggest that at least until the early 11th century, Middle Persian was still the literary language of the hereditary Zoroastrian priesthood. Nonetheless, aside from the &quot;Qissa&quot; and the Kanheri inscriptions, there is little evidence of the Parsis until the 12th and 13th century, when &quot;masterly&quot; Sanskrit translations and transcriptions of the Avesta and its commentaries began to be prepared. From these translations Dhalla infers that &quot;religious studies were prosecuted with great zeal at this period&quot; and that the command of Middle Persian and Sanskrit among the clerics &quot;was of a superior order&quot;.

From the 13th century to the late 16th century, the Zoroastrian priests of Gujarat sent (in all) twenty-two requests for religious guidance to their co-religionists in Iran, presumably because they considered the Iranian Zoroastrians &quot;better informed on religious matters than themselves, and must have preserved the old-time tradition more faithfully than they themselves did&quot;. These transmissions and their replies – assiduously preserved by the community as the &quot;rivayat&quot;s (epistles) – span the years 1478–1766 and deal with both religious and social subjects. From a superficial 21st century point of view, some of these &quot;ithoter&quot; (&quot;questions&quot;) are remarkably trivial – for instance, &quot;Rivayat&quot; 376: whether ink prepared by a non-Zoroastrian is suitable for copying Avestan language texts – but they provide a discerning insight into the fears and anxieties of the early modern Zoroastrians. Thus, the question of the ink is symptomatic of the fear of assimilation and the loss of identity, a theme that dominates the questions posed and continues to be an issue into the 21st century. So also the question of conversion of &quot;Juddin&quot;s (non-Zoroastrians) to Zoroastrianism, to which the reply (R237, R238) was: acceptable, even meritorious.

Nonetheless, &quot;the precarious condition in which they lived for a considerable period made it impracticable for them to keep up their former proselytizing zeal. The instinctive fear of disintegration and absorption in the vast multitudes among whom they lived created in them a spirit of exclusiveness and a strong desire to preserve the racial characteristics and distinctive features of their community. Living in an atmosphere surcharged with the Hindu caste system, they felt that their own safety lay in encircling their fold by rigid caste barriers&quot;. Even so, at some point (possibly shortly after their arrival in India), the Zoroastrians – perhaps determining that the social stratification that they had brought with them was unsustainable in the small community – did away with all but the hereditary priesthood (called the &quot;asronih&quot; in Sassanid Iran). The remaining estates – the &quot;(r)atheshtarih&quot; (nobility, soldiers, and civil servants), &quot;vastaryoshih&quot; (farmers and herdsmen), &quot;hutokshih&quot; (artisans and labourers) – were folded into an all-comprehensive class today known as the &quot;behdini&quot; (&quot;followers of &quot;daena&quot;&quot;, for which &quot;good religion&quot; is one translation). This change would have far reaching consequences. For one, it opened the gene pool to some extent since until that time inter-class marriages were exceedingly rare (this would continue to be a problem for the priesthood until the 20th century). For another, it did away with the boundaries along occupational lines, a factor that would endear the Parsis to the 18th- and 19th-century colonial authorities who had little patience for the unpredictable complications of the Hindu caste system (such as when a clerk from one caste would not deal with a clerk from another).

=== Age of opportunity ===
Following the commercial treaty in the early 17th century between Mughal emperor Jahangir and James I of England, the East India Company obtained the exclusive rights to reside and build factories in Surat and other areas. Many Parsis, who until then had been living in farming communities throughout Gujarat, moved to the English-run settlements to take the new jobs offered. In 1668 the English East India Company leased the Seven Islands of Bombay from Charles II of England. The company found the deep harbour on the east coast of the islands to be ideal for setting up their first port in the sub-continent, and in 1687 they transferred their headquarters from Surat to the fledgling settlement. The Parsis followed and soon began to occupy posts of trust in connection with government and public works.

Where literacy had previously been the exclusive domain of the priesthood, in the era of the British Raj, the British schools in India provided the new Parsi youth with the means not only to learn to read and write but also to be educated in the greater sense of the term and become familiar with the quirks of the British establishment. These capabilities were enormously useful to Parsis since they allowed them to &quot;represent themselves as being like the British,&quot; which they did &quot;more diligently and effectively than perhaps any other South Asian community&quot;. While the colonial authorities often saw the other Indians &quot;as passive, ignorant, irrational, outwardly submissive but inwardly guileful&quot;, the Parsis were seen to have the traits that the authorities tended to ascribe to themselves. Johan Albrecht de Mandelslo (1638) saw them as &quot;diligent&quot;, &quot;conscientious&quot;, and &quot;skillful&quot; in their mercantile pursuits. Similar observations would be made by James Mackintosh, Recorder of Bombay from 1804 to 1811, who noted that &quot;the Parsees are a small remnant of one of the mightiest nations of the ancient world, who, flying from persecution into India, were for many ages lost in obscurity and poverty, till at length they met a just government under which they speedily rose to be one of the most popular mercantile bodies in Asia&quot;.

One of these was an enterprising agent named Rustom Maneck. In 1702, Maneck, who had probably already amassed a fortune under the Dutch and Portuguese, was appointed the first broker to the East India Company (acquiring the name &quot;Seth&quot; in the process), and in the following years &quot;he and his Parsi associates widened the occupational and financial horizons of the larger Parsi community&quot;. Thus, by the mid-18th century, the brokerage houses of the Bombay Presidency were almost all in Parsi hands. As James Forbes, the Collector of Broach (now Bharuch), would note in his &quot;Oriental Memoirs&quot; (1770): &quot;many of the principal merchants and owners of ships at Bombay and Surat are Parsees.&quot; &quot;Active, robust, prudent and persevering, they now form a very valuable part of the Company&#x27;s subjects on the western shores of Hindustan where they are highly esteemed&quot;.In the 18th century, Parsis with their skills in ship building and trade greatly benefited with trade between India and China. The trade was mainly in timber, silk, cotton and opium. For example Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy acquired most of his wealth through trade in cotton and opium Gradually certain families &quot;acquired wealth and prominence (Sorabji, Modi, Cama, Wadia, Jeejeebhoy, Readymoney, Dadyseth, Petit, Patel, Mehta, Allbless, Tata, etc.), many of which would be noted for their participation in the public life of the city, and for their various educational, industrial, and charitable enterprises.&quot;).

Through his largesse, Maneck helped establish the infrastructure that was necessary for the Parsis to set themselves up in Bombay and in doing so &quot;established Bombay as the primary centre of Parsi habitation and work in the 1720s&quot;. Following the political and economic isolation of Surat in the 1720s and 1730s that resulted from troubles between the (remnant) Mughal authorities and the increasingly dominant Marathas, a number of Parsi families from Surat migrated to the new city. While in 1700 &quot;fewer than a handful of individuals appear as merchants in any records; by mid-century, Parsis engaged in commerce constituted one of important commercial groups in Bombay&quot;. Maneck&#x27;s generosity is incidentally also the first documented instance of Parsi philanthropy. In 1689, Anglican chaplain John Ovington reported that in Surat the family &quot;assist the poor and are ready to provide for the sustenance and comfort of such as want it. Their universal kindness, either employing such as are ready and able to work, or bestowing a seasonable bounteous charity to such as are infirm and miserable, leave no man destitute of relief, nor suffer a beggar in all their tribe&quot;.
In 1728 Rustom&#x27;s eldest son Naoroz (later Naorojee) founded the Bombay Parsi Panchayet (in the sense of an instrument for self-governance and not in the sense of the trust it is today) to assist newly arriving Parsis in religious, social, legal and financial matters. Using their vast resources, the Maneck Seth family gave their time, energy and not inconsiderable financial resources to the Parsi community, with the result that by the mid-18th century, the Panchayat was the accepted means for Parsis to cope with the exigencies of urban life and the recognized instrument for regulating the affairs of the community. Nonetheless, by 1838 the Panchayat was under attack for impropriety and nepotism. In 1855 the &quot;Bombay Times&quot; noted that the Panchayat was utterly without the moral or legal authority to enforce its statutes (the &quot;Bundobusts&quot; or codes of conduct) and the council soon ceased to be considered representative of the community. In the wake of a July 1856 ruling by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that it had no jurisdiction over the Parsis in matters of marriage and divorce, the Panchayat was reduced to little more than a Government-recognized &quot;Parsi Matrimonial Court&quot;. Although the Panchayat would eventually be reestablished as the administrator of community property, it ultimately ceased to be an instrument for self-governance.

At about the same time as the role of the Panchayat was declining, a number of other institutions arose that would replace the Panchayat&#x27;s role in contributing to the sense of social cohesiveness that the community desperately sought. By the mid-19th century, the Parsis were keenly aware that their numbers were declining and saw education as a possible solution to the problem. In 1842 Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy established the Parsi Benevolent Fund with the aim of improving, through education, the condition of the impoverished Parsis still living in Surat and its environs. In 1849 the Parsis established their first school (co-educational, which was a novelty at the time, but would soon be split into separate schools for boys and girls) and the education movement quickened. The number of Parsi schools multiplied, but other schools and colleges were also freely attended. Accompanied by better education and social cohesiveness, the community&#x27;s sense of distinctiveness grew, and in 1854 Dinshaw Maneckji Petit founded the Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund with the aim of improving conditions for his less fortunate co-religionists in Iran. The fund succeeded in convincing a number of Iranian Zoroastrians to emigrate to India (where they are known today as Iranis) and the efforts of its emissary Maneckji Limji Hataria were instrumental in obtaining a remission of the jizya for their co-religionists in 1882.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Parsis had emerged as &quot;the foremost people in India in matters educational, industrial, and social. They came in the vanguard of progress, amassed vast fortunes, and munificently gave away large sums in charity&quot;. Near the end of the 19th century, the total number of Parsis in colonial India was 85,397, of which 48,507 lived in Bombay, constituting around 6.7% of the total population of the city, according to the 1881 census. This would be the last time that the Parsis would be considered a numerically significant minority in the city.

Nonetheless, the legacy of the 19th century was a sense of self-awareness as a community. The typically Parsi cultural symbols of the 17th and 18th centuries such as language (a Parsi variant of Gujarati), arts, crafts, and sartorial habits developed into Parsi theatre, literature, newspapers, magazines, and schools. The Parsis now ran community medical centres, ambulance corps, Scouting troops, clubs, and Masonic Lodges. They had their own charitable foundations, housing estates, legal institutions, courts, and governance. They were no longer weavers and petty merchants, but now were established and ran banks, mills, heavy industry, shipyards, and shipping companies. Moreover, even while maintaining their own cultural identity they did not fail to recognize themselves as nationally Indian, as Dadabhai Naoroji, the first Asian to occupy a seat in the British Parliament would note: &quot;Whether I am a Hindu, a Mohammedan, a Parsi, a Christian, or of any other creed, I am above all an Indian. Our country is India; our nationality is Indian&quot;. While having an outsized role in the Indian independence movement, the majority of Parsis opposed the partition of undivided India.

== Change in religious education ==

In the 1860s and 1870s, the linguist Martin Haug interpreted Zoroastrian scripture in Christian terms, and compared the &quot;yazata&quot;s to the angels of Christianity. In this scheme, the Amesha Spentas are the arch-angel retinue of Ahura Mazda, with the &quot;hamkars&quot; as the supporting host of lesser angels.

At the time Haug wrote his translations, the Parsi (i.e. Indian Zoroastrian) community was under intense pressure from English and American missionaries, who severely criticized the Zoroastrians for—as John Wilson portrayed it in 1843—&quot;polytheism&quot;, which the missionaries argued was much less worth than their own &quot;monotheism&quot;. At the time, Zoroastrianism lacked theologians of its own, and so the Zoroastrians were poorly equipped to make their own case. In this situation, Haug&#x27;s counter-interpretation came as a welcome relief, and was (by-and-large) gratefully accepted as legitimate.

Haug&#x27;s interpretations were subsequently disseminated as Zoroastrian ones, which then eventually reached the west where they were seen to corroborate Haug. Like most of Haug&#x27;s interpretations, this comparison is today so well entrenched that a gloss of &#x27;yazata&#x27; as &#x27;angel&#x27; is almost universally accepted; both in publications intended for a general audience as well as in (non-philological) academic literature.

The migration of Parsis to India caused a lack of religious knowledge, which led to doubts in several matters, which made them send men to Iran during the Muslim rule in order to learn the religion from the Zoroastrians in Iran. However, according to the orientalist Arthur Christensen and several Arab historians, the Zoroastrian doctrine changed after the fall of the Sassanid state because the Zoroastrian clerics tried to save their religion from extinction by modifying it to resemble the religion of the Muslims. So that the Zoroastrians would not have a reason to convert to Islam, but this did not succeed in preventing the Zoroastrians from converting to Islam, and it also caused the emergence of a new version of Zoroastrianism that resembled Islam and differed from Zoroastrianism in the Sassanid era.

The main components of Zoroastrianism as practiced by the Parsi community are the concepts of purity and pollution (nasu), initiation (navjot), daily prayers, worship at Fire Temples, marriage, funerals, and general worship via practicing good thoughts, words and deeds.

== Religious practices ==
=== Purity and pollution ===
The balance between good and evil is correlated to the idea of purity and pollution. Purity is held to be of the very essence of godliness. Pollution&#x27;s very point is to destroy purity through the death of a human. In order to adhere to purity it is the duty of Parsis to continue to preserve purity within their body as God created them. A Zoroastrian priest spends his entire life dedicated to following a holy life.

=== &quot;Navjote&quot; ===
Zoroastrians are not initiated by infant baptism. Children are initiated into the faith when they are old enough to recite some required prayers along with the priest at the time of the Navjote ceremony, ideally before they reach puberty. Though there is no actual age by which a child must be initiated into the faith (preferably after seven years), Navjote cannot be performed on an adult. While the Parsi traditionally do not do adult Navjote (except in cases where it is performed for descendants of Parsi wanting to join the faith), the Iranian Zoroastrian equivalent, the sedreh-pushti can be done at any age for those wanting to convert.

The initiation begins with a ritual bath, then a spiritual cleansing prayer; the child changes into white pajama pants, a shawl, and a small cap. Following introductory prayers, the child is given the sacred items that are associated with Zoroastrianism: a sacred shirt and cord, sudre, and kusti. The child then faces the main priest and fire is brought in to represent God. Once the priest finishes with the prayers, the child&#x27;s initiation is complete and he or she has become part of the community and religion.

=== Marriage ===
Marriage is very important to the members of the Parsi community, believing that in order to continue the expansion of God&#x27;s kingdom they must procreate. Up until the mid-19th century child marriages were common even though the idea of child marriage was not part of the religious doctrine. Consequently, when social reform started happening in India, the Parsi community discontinued the practice. There are, however, rising problems over the availability of brides. More and more women in the Parsi community are becoming well educated and are therefore either delaying marriage or not partaking at all. Women within the Parsi community in India are 97% literate; 42% have completed high school or college and 29% have an occupation in which they earn a substantial amount of money. The wedding ceremony begins much like the initiation with a cleansing bath. The bride and groom then travel to the wedding in florally decorated cars. The priests from both families facilitate the wedding. The couple begin by facing one another with a sheet to block their view of each another. Wool is passed over the two seven times to bind them together. The two are then supposed to throw rice to their partner symbolizing dominance. The religious element comes in next when the two sit side by side to face the priest. 

=== Funerals ===

The pollution that is associated with death has to be handled carefully. A separate part of the home is designated to house the corpse for funeral proceedings before being taken away. The priest comes to say prayers that are for the cleansing of sins and to affirm the faith of the deceased. Fire is brought to the room and prayers are begun. The body is washed and inserted clean within a sudre and kusti. The ceremony then begins, and a circle is drawn around the body into which only the bearers may enter. As they proceed to the cemetery they walk in pairs and are connected by white fabric. A dog is essential in the funeral process because it is able to see death. The body is taken to the tower of death where the vultures feed on it. Once the bones are bleached by the sun they are pushed into the circular opening in the center. The mourning process is four days long, and rather than creating graves for the dead, charities are established in honor of the person.

=== Temples ===

Zoroastrian festivals were originally held outside in the open air; temples were not common until later. Most of the temples were built by wealthy Parsis who needed centers that housed purity. As stated before, fire is considered to represent the presence of Ahura Mazda, and there are two distinct differences for the types of fire for the different temples. The first type of temple is the Atash Behram, which is the highest level of fire. The fire is prepared for an entire year before it can be installed, and once it is, it is cared for to the highest possible degree. There are only eight such temples located within India. The second type of fire temple is called a Dar-i Mihr, and the preparation process is not as intense. There are about 160 of these located throughout India.

== Factions within the community ==
=== Calendrical differences ===
Until about the 12th century, all Zoroastrians followed the same 365-day religious calendar, which had remained largely unmodified since the calendar reforms of Ardashir I (&quot;r.&quot; 226-241 AD). Since that calendar did not compensate for the fractional days that go to make up a full solar year, with time it was no longer accordant with the seasons.

Sometime between 1125 and 1250 (&quot;cf.&quot; ), the Parsis inserted an embolismic month to level out the accumulating fractional days. However, the Parsis were the only Zoroastrians to do so (and did it only once), with the result that, from then on, the calendar in use by the Parsis and the calendar in use by Zoroastrians elsewhere diverged by a matter of thirty days. The calendars still had the same name, &quot;Shahenshahi&quot; (imperial), presumably because none were aware that the calendars were no longer the same.

In 1745 the Parsis in and around Surat switched to the &quot;Kadmi&quot; or &quot;Kadimi&quot; calendar on the recommendation of their priests who were convinced that the calendar in use in the ancient homeland must be correct. Moreover, they denigrated the &quot;Shahenshahi&quot; calendar as being &quot;royalist&quot;.

In 1906 attempts to bring the two factions together resulted in the introduction of a third calendar based on an 11th-century Seljuk model: the &quot;Fasili&quot;, or &quot;Fasli&quot;, calendar had leap days intercalated every four years and it had a New Year&#x27;s day that fell on the day of the vernal equinox. Although it was the only calendar always in harmony with the seasons, most members of the Parsi community rejected it on the grounds that it was not in accord with the injunctions expressed in Zoroastrian tradition (&quot;Dēnkard&quot; 3.419).

Today the majority of Parsis are adherents of the Parsi version of the &quot;Shahenshahi&quot; calendar although the &quot;Kadmi&quot; calendar does have its adherents among the Parsi communities of Surat and Bharuch. The &quot;Fasli&quot; calendar does not have a significant following among Parsis, but, by virtue of being compatible with the &quot;Bastani&quot; calendar (an Iranian development with the same salient features as the &quot;Fasli&quot; calendar), it is predominant among the Zoroastrians of Iran.

==== Effect of the calendar disputes ====
Since some of the Avesta prayers contain references to the names of the months, and some other prayers are used only at specific times of the year, the issue of which calendar is &quot;correct&quot; also has theological ramifications.

To further complicate matters, in the late 18th century (or early 19th century) a highly influential head-priest and staunch proponent of the &quot;Kadmi&quot; calendar, Phiroze Kaus Dastur of the Dadyseth Atash-Behram in Bombay, became convinced that the pronunciation of prayers as recited by visitors from Iran was correct, while the pronunciation as used by the Parsis was not. He accordingly went on to alter some (but not all) of the prayers, which in due course came to be accepted by all adherents of the &quot;Kadmi&quot; calendar as the more ancient (and thus presumably correct). However, scholars of Avestan language and linguistics attribute the difference in pronunciation to a vowel-shift that occurred only in Iran and that the Iranian pronunciation as adopted by the &quot;Kadmi&quot;s is actually more recent than the pronunciation used by the non-&quot;Kadmi&quot; Parsis.

The calendar disputes were not always purely academic, either. In the 1780s, emotions over the controversy ran so high that violence occasionally erupted. In 1783 a &quot;Shahenshahi&quot; resident of Bharuch named Homaji Jamshedji was sentenced to death for kicking a young &quot;Kadmi&quot; woman and so causing her to miscarry.

Of the eight Atash-Behrams (the highest grade of fire temple) in India, three follow the &quot;Kadmi&quot; pronunciation and calendar, the other five are &quot;Shahenshahi&quot;. The &quot;Fassali&quot;s do not have their own Atash-Behram.

=== &quot;Ilm-e-Khshnoom&quot; ===

The &quot;Ilm-e-Kshnoom&quot; (&#x27;science of ecstasy&#x27;, or &#x27;science of bliss&#x27;) is a school of Parsi-Zoroastrian philosophy based on a mystic and esoteric, rather than literal, interpretation of religious texts. According to adherents of the sect, they are followers of the Zoroastrian faith as preserved by a clan of 2000 individuals called the &quot;Saheb-e-Dilan&quot; (&#x27;Masters of the Heart&#x27;) who are said to live in complete isolation in the mountainous recesses of the Caucasus (alternatively, in the Alborz range, around Mount Damavand).

There are few obvious indications that a Parsi might be a follower of the Kshnoom. Although their &quot;Kusti&quot; prayers are very similar to those used by the &quot;Fassali&quot;s, like the rest of the Parsi community the followers of Kshnoom are divided with respect to which calendar they observe. There are also other minor differences in their recitation of the liturgy, such as repetition of some sections of the longer prayers. Nonetheless, the Kshnoom are extremely conservative in their ideology and prefer isolation even with respect to other Parsis.

The largest community of followers of the Kshnoom lives in Jogeshwari, a suburb of Bombay, where they have their own fire temple (Behramshah Nowroji Shroff Daremeher), their own housing colony (Behram Baug) and their own newspaper (&quot;Parsi Pukar&quot;). There is a smaller concentration of adherents in Surat, where the sect was founded in the last decades of the 19th century.

=== Issues relating to the deceased ===

It has been traditional, in Mumbai and Karachi at least, for dead Parsis to be taken to the Towers of Silence where the corpses are quickly eaten by the city&#x27;s vultures. The reason given for this practice is that earth, fire, and water are considered sacred elements which should not be defiled by the dead. Therefore, burial and cremation have always been prohibited in Parsi culture. However, in modern day Mumbai and Karachi the population of vultures has drastically reduced due to extensive urbanization and the unintended consequence of treating humans and livestock with antibiotics, and the anti-inflammatory diclofenac, which harm vultures and have led to the Indian vulture crisis. As a result, the bodies of the deceased are taking much longer to decompose. Solar panels have been installed in the Towers of Silence to speed up the decomposition process, but this has been only partially successful especially during monsoons. In Peshawar a Parsi graveyard was established in the late 19th century, which still exists; this cemetery is unique as there is no Tower of Silence. Nevertheless, the majority of Parsis still use the traditional method of disposing of their loved ones and consider this as the last act of charity by the deceased on earth.

The Tower of Silence in Mumbai is located at Doongerwadi at Malabar Hill. In Karachi, the Tower of Silence is located in Parsi Colony, near the Chanesar Goth and Mehmoodabad localities.

==Archaeogenetics==
Genealogical DNA tests have brought mixed results. Some studies support the Parsi contention that they have maintained their Persian roots by avoiding intermarriage with local populations.

A study published in &quot;Genome Biology&quot; based on high density SNP data has shown that the Parsis are genetically closer to Iranian populations than to their South Asian neighbours. They also share the highest number of haplotypes with present-day Iranians; the admixture of the Parsis with Indian populations was estimated have occurred approximately 1,200 years ago. It is also found that Parsis are genetically closer to Neolithic Iranians than to modern Iranians who had recently received some genes from the Near East.

In that 2002 study of the Y-chromosome (patrilineal) DNA of the Parsis of Pakistan, it was determined that Parsis are genetically closer to Iranians than to their neighbours. A 2023 study was the first to delve deeply into maternal ancestry with high-resolution mitochondrial markers. They conducted a detailed phylogenetic analysis to infer their maternal genetic affinity. This revealed the Parsi mitogenomes, characterized by the mtDNA haplogroup M3a1 + 204, share a clade with both Middle Eastern and South Asian modern individuals in both the Maximum Likelihood tree and Bayesian phylogenetic tree. This haplogroup was also prevalent among the medieval Swat valley population and was observed in two Roopkund A individuals. In the phylogenetic network, these samples share a haplotype with both South Asian and Middle Eastern samples. Thus, the maternal ancestry of the first Parsi settlers includes genetic components similar to South Asian and Middle Eastern populations.

In 2017, a research study discovered that Parsis exhibit a stronger genetic affinity with Neolithic Iranians than with modern Iranians, who have experienced more recent admixture from the Near East. The study also identified 48% of South-Asian-specific mitochondrial lineages in ancient samples, which could be attributed to the assimilation of local females during the initial settlement or may be representative of mitochondrial lineages that have become extinct in Iran. That would make the population genetics of Parsis about 3/4 Iranian and 1/4 Indian.

The genetic studies of Parsis of Pakistan show sharp contrast between genetic data obtained from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y-chromosome DNA (Y-DNA), different from most populations. Historical records suggests that they had moved from Iran to India, first to Gujarat and then to Mumbai and Karachi. According to Y-DNA, they resemble the Iranian population, which supports historical records. When the mtDNA pool is compared to Iranians and Gujaratis (their putative parental populations), it contrasted Y-DNA data. Parsis have a high frequency of haplogroup M (55%), similar to Indians, which is just 1.7% in combined Iranian sample. According to the research findings, there is a noticeable contrast between the maternal and paternal components of the Parsi population. Despite their small population size, the high diversity observed in both the Y-DNA and mtDNA lineages suggests that a strong drift effect is improbable. The studies suggest a male-mediated migration of Parsi ancestors from Iran to Gujarat where they admixed with the local female population during initial settlements, which ultimately resulted in loss of Iranian mtDNA.

The absence of lung cancer-related DNA mutational signals among Parsis both point to the community&#x27;s distinctive non-smoking social practises, which have been practised for millennia. Additionally Parsis have high prevalence of longevity as a genetic feature. Parsis have however been shown to have high rates of breast cancer bladder cancer, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

== Notable Parsi people ==
D. L. Sheth, the former director of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), lists Indian communities that constituted the middle class and were traditionally &quot;urban and professional&quot; (following professions such as doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers, etc.) immediately after Indian partition in 1947. This list included the Kashmiri Pandits, the Nagar Brahmins from Gujarat, the Brahmins from Southern India, the Punjabi Khatris and Kayastha from northern India, the Chitpavans and CKPs from Maharashtra; Bengali Probasis and Bhadraloks, the Parsis, as well as the upper echelons of the Indian Muslim and Indian Christian communities throughout the country. According to Pavan K. Varma, &quot;Education was a common thread that bound together this pan-Indian elite&quot;; almost all of the members of these communities could read and write in English and were educated beyond regular schooling institutions.

The Parsis have made considerable contributions to the history and development of India, all the more remarkable considering their small numbers. As the maxim &quot;Parsi, thy name is charity&quot; alludes to, their most prominent contribution is their philanthropy.

Although their people&#x27;s name Parsi comes from the Persian-language word for a Persian person, in Sanskrit the term means &quot;one who gives alms&quot;.

Mahatma Gandhi would note in a much misquoted statement, &quot;I am proud of my country, India, for having produced the splendid Zoroastrian stock, in numbers beneath contempt, but in charity and philanthropy perhaps unequaled and certainly unsurpassed.&quot;

Several landmarks in Mumbai are named after Parsis, including Nariman Point. The Malabar Hill in Mumbai, is a home to several prominent Parsis. Parsis prominent in the Indian independence movement include Pherozeshah Mehta, Dadabhai Naoroji, and Bhikaiji Cama.

Particularly notable Parsis in the fields of science and industry include physicist Homi J. Bhabha, nuclear scientist Homi N. Sethna, industrialists J. R. D. Tata and Jamsetji Tata, regarded as the &quot;Father of Indian Industry&quot;, and construction tycoon Pallonji Mistry. The families Godrej, Mistry family, Tata, Petit, Cowasjee, Poonawalla, and Wadia are important industrial Parsi families.
Other notable Parsi business persons include Ratan Tata, Cyrus Mistry, Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata, Dinshaw Maneckji Petit, Ness Wadia, Neville Wadia, Jehangir Wadia and Nusli Wadiaall of them related through marriage to Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan. Mohammad Ali Jinnah&#x27;s wife Rattanbai Petit, was born into two of the Parsi PetitTata families, and their daughter Dina Jinnah was married to Parsi industrialist Neville Wadia, the scion of the Wadia family. Other notable businessmen include Cyrus Poonawalla and his son Adar Poonawalla. The husband of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and son-in-law of Jawaharlal Nehru, Feroze Gandhi, was a Parsi with ancestral roots in Bharuch.

The Parsi community has given India several distinguished military officers. Field Marshal Sam Hormusji Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw, Military Cross, the architect of India&#x27;s victory in the 1971 war, was the first officer of the Indian Army to be appointed a Field Marshal. Admiral Jal Cursetji was the first Parsi to be appointed Chief of the Naval Staff of the Indian Navy. Air Marshal Aspy Engineer served as India&#x27;s second Chief of Air Staff, post-independence, and Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major served as the 18th Chief of Air Staff. Vice Admiral RF Contractor served as the 17th Chief of the Indian Coast Guard. Lieutenant Colonel Ardeshir Burjorji Tarapore was killed in action in the 1965 Indo-Pakistan war and was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India&#x27;s highest military award for gallantry in action.

The Parsi community has produced several notable sports figures who have made significant contributions to their respective fields. In cricket, Nari Contractor, Rusi Modi, Farokh Engineer and Polly Umrigar were renowned for their exceptional skills and leadership. In music, rock musician Freddie Mercury; composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji; conductor Zubin Mehta.

In literature and journalism, they boast authors Rohinton Mistry, Firdaus Kanga, Bapsi Sidhwa, Ardashir Vakil, and investigative journalists Ardeshir Cowasjee, Russi Karanjia, and Behram Contractor. The film industry features screenwriter and photographer Sooni Taraporevala, actors Boman Irani, Erick Avari, actresses Nina Wadia and Persis Khambatta, and Thailand&#x27;s cinematic pioneer Rattana Pestonji.

Educational and legal achievements include educator Jamshed Bharucha, suffragist, cultural studies theorist Homi K. Bhabha, and first female barrister Mithan Jamshed Lam, Pakistan&#x27;s first Parsi Supreme Court Justice Dorab Patel, and constitutional experts Fali S. Nariman and Nani Ardeshir Palkhivala, along with former Attorney-General of India Soli Sorabjee, and Supreme Court Justice Rohinton F. Nariman, India&#x27;s first female photojournalist, Homai Vyarawalla, also hails from this community, as does Naxalite leader and intellectual Kobad Ghandy.

<text>John Sidney McCain III (August 29, 1936 – August 25, 2018) was an American statesman and naval officer who represented the state of Arizona in Congress for over 35 years, first as a Representative from 1983 to 1987, and then as a U.S. senator from 1987 until his death in 2018. He was the Republican Party&#x27;s nominee in the 2008 U.S. presidential election.

McCain was a son of Admiral John S. McCain Jr. and grandson of Admiral John S. McCain Sr. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958 and received a commission in the U.S. Navy. McCain became a naval aviator and flew ground-attack aircraft from aircraft carriers. During the Vietnam War, he almost died in the 1967 USS &quot;Forrestal&quot; fire. While on a bombing mission during Operation Rolling Thunder over Hanoi in October 1967, McCain was shot down, seriously injured, and captured by the North Vietnamese. He was a prisoner of war until 1973. McCain experienced episodes of torture and refused an out-of-sequence early release. He sustained wounds that left him with lifelong physical disabilities. McCain retired from the Navy as a captain in 1981 and moved to Arizona.

In 1982, McCain was elected to the House of Representatives, where he served two terms. Four years later, he was elected to the Senate, where he served six terms. While generally adhering to conservative principles, McCain also gained a reputation as a &quot;maverick&quot; for his willingness to break from his party on certain issues, including LGBT rights, gun regulations, and campaign finance reform where his stances were more moderate than those of the party&#x27;s base. McCain was investigated and largely exonerated in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as one of the Keating Five; he then made regulating the financing of political campaigns one of his signature concerns, which eventually resulted in passage of the McCain–Feingold Act in 2002. He was also known for his work in the 1990s to restore diplomatic relations with Vietnam. McCain chaired the Senate Commerce Committee from 1997 to 2001 and 2003 to 2005, where he opposed pork barrel spending and earmarks. He belonged to the bipartisan &quot;Gang of 14&quot;, which played a key role in alleviating a crisis over judicial nominations.

McCain entered the race for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination, but lost a heated primary season contest to George W. Bush. He secured the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, beating fellow candidates Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee, though he lost the general election to Barack Obama. McCain subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the Obama administration, especially with regard to foreign policy matters. In 2015, he became Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He refused to support then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election and later became a vocal critic of the Trump administration. While McCain opposed the Obama-era Affordable Care Act (ACA), he cast the deciding vote against the American Health Care Act of 2017, which would have partially repealed the ACA. After being diagnosed with glioblastoma in 2017, he reduced his role in the Senate to focus on treatment, dying from the disease in 2018.

== Early life and military career (1936–1981) ==
=== Early life and education ===

John Sidney McCain III was born on August 29, 1936, at Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone, to naval officer John S. McCain Jr. and Roberta Wright McCain. He had an older sister, Sandy, and a younger brother, Joe. At that time, the Panama Canal was under U.S. control, and he was granted U.S. citizenship at the age of eleven months.

His father and his paternal grandfather, John S. McCain Sr., were also Naval Academy graduates and both became four-star admirals in the United States Navy. The McCain family moved with their father as he took various naval postings in the United States and in the Pacific. As a result, the younger McCain attended a total of about 20 schools. In 1951, the family settled in Northern Virginia, and McCain attended Episcopal High School, a private preparatory boarding school in Alexandria. He excelled at wrestling and graduated in 1954. He referred to himself as an Episcopalian as recently as June 2007, after which date he said he came to identify as a Baptist.

Following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, McCain entered the United States Naval Academy, where he was a friend and informal leader for many of his classmates and sometimes stood up for targets of bullying. He also fought as a lightweight boxer. He earned the nickname &quot;John Wayne&quot; &quot;for his attitude and popularity with the opposite sex.&quot; McCain did well in academic subjects that interested him, such as literature and history, but studied only enough to pass subjects that gave him difficulty, such as mathematics. He came into conflict with higher-ranking personnel and did not always obey the rules. &quot;He collected demerits the way some people collect stamps.&quot; His class rank (894 of 899) was not indicative of his intelligence nor his IQ, which had been tested to be 128 and 133. McCain graduated in 1958.

=== Naval training, first marriage, and Vietnam War assignment ===

McCain began his early military career when he was commissioned as an ensign, and started two and a half years of training at Pensacola to become a naval aviator. While there, he earned a reputation as a man who partied. He completed flight school in 1960, and became a naval pilot of ground-attack aircraft; he was assigned to A-1 Skyraider squadrons aboard the aircraft carriers and in the Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas. McCain began as a sub-par flier who was at times careless and reckless; during the early to mid-1960s, two of his flight missions crashed, and a third mission collided with power lines, but he received no major injuries. His aviation skills improved over time, and he was seen as a good pilot, albeit one who tended to &quot;push the envelope&quot; in his flying.

On July 3, 1965, McCain was 28 when he married Carol Shepp, who had worked as a runway model and secretary. McCain adopted her two young children, Douglas and Andrew. He and Carol then had a daughter, Sidney. The same year, he was a one-day champion on the game show &quot;Jeopardy&quot;!

McCain requested a combat assignment, and was assigned to the aircraft carrier flying A-4 Skyhawks. His combat duty began in mid-1967, when &quot;Forrestal&quot; was assigned to a bombing campaign, Operation Rolling Thunder, during the Vietnam War. Stationed in the Gulf of Tonkin, McCain and his fellow pilots became frustrated by micromanagement from Washington; he later wrote, &quot;In all candor, we thought our civilian commanders were complete idiots who didn&#x27;t have the least notion of what it took to win the war.&quot;

On July 29, 1967, McCain was a lieutenant commander when he was near the center of the USS &quot;Forrestal&quot; fire. He escaped from his burning jet and was trying to help another pilot escape when a bomb exploded; McCain was struck in the legs and chest by fragments. The ensuing fire killed 134 sailors. With the &quot;Forrestal&quot; out of commission, McCain volunteered for assignment with the , another carrier employed in Operation Rolling Thunder. There, he was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal and the Bronze Star Medal for missions flown over North Vietnam.

=== Prisoner of war ===

McCain was taken prisoner of war on October 26, 1967. He was flying his 23rd bombing mission over North Vietnam when his A-4E Skyhawk was shot down by a missile over Hanoi. McCain fractured both arms and a leg when he ejected from the aircraft, and nearly drowned after he parachuted into Trúc Bạch Lake. Some North Vietnamese pulled him ashore, then others crushed his shoulder with a rifle butt and bayoneted him. McCain was then transported to Hanoi&#x27;s main Hỏa Lò Prison, nicknamed the &quot;Hanoi Hilton&quot;.

Although McCain was seriously wounded and injured, his captors refused to treat him. They beat and interrogated him and he was given medical care only when the North Vietnamese discovered that his father was an admiral. His status as a prisoner of war (POW) made the front pages of major American newspapers.

McCain spent six weeks in the hospital, where he received marginal care. He had lost , he was in a chest cast, and his gray hair had turned white. McCain was sent to a different camp on the outskirts of Hanoi. In December 1967, McCain was placed in a cell with two other Americans, who did not expect him to live more than a week. In March 1968, McCain was placed in solitary confinement, where he remained for two years.

In mid-1968, his father John S. McCain Jr. was named commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater, and the North Vietnamese offered McCain early release because they wanted to appear merciful for propaganda purposes, and also to show other POWs that elite prisoners were willing to be treated preferentially. McCain refused repatriation unless every man taken in before him was also released. Such early release was prohibited by the POWs&#x27; interpretation of the military Code of Conduct, which states in Article III: &quot;I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy.&quot; To prevent the enemy from using prisoners for propaganda, officers were to agree to be released in the order in which they were captured.

Beginning in August 1968, McCain was subjected to severe torture. He was bound and beaten every two hours, and he was suffering from heat exhaustion and dysentery. Further injuries brought McCain to &quot;the point of suicide&quot;, but his preparations were interrupted by guards. Eventually, McCain made an anti-U.S. propaganda &quot;confession&quot;. He had always felt that his statement was dishonorable, but as he later wrote: &quot;I had learned what we all learned over there: every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine.&quot; Many U.S. POWs were tortured and maltreated to extract &quot;confessions&quot; and propaganda statements; virtually all eventually yielded something. McCain received two to three beatings weekly because of his continued refusal to sign additional statements.

McCain refused to meet various anti-war groups seeking peace in Hanoi, wanting to give neither them nor the North Vietnamese a propaganda victory. From late 1969, treatment of McCain and many of the other POWs became more tolerable, while McCain continued to resist the camp authorities. McCain and other prisoners cheered the U.S. &quot;Christmas Bombing&quot; campaign of December 1972, viewing it as a forceful measure to push North Vietnam to terms.

McCain was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for five and a half years, until his release on March 14, 1973, along with 108 other prisoners of war. His wartime injuries left him permanently incapable of raising his arms above his head. After the war, McCain, accompanied by his family, returned to the site on a few occasions.

=== Commanding officer, liaison to Senate, and second marriage ===

McCain was reunited with his family when he returned to the United States. His wife Carol had been severely injured by an automobile accident in December 1969. She was then four inches shorter, in a wheelchair or on crutches, and substantially heavier than when he had last seen her. As a returned POW, he became a celebrity of sorts.


McCain underwent treatment for his injuries that included months of physical therapy. He attended the National War College at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C., during 1973–1974. He was rehabilitated by late 1974, and his flight status was reinstated. In 1976, he became Commanding Officer of a training squadron stationed in Florida. He improved the unit&#x27;s flight readiness and safety records, and won the squadron its first-ever Meritorious Unit Commendation. During this period in Florida, he had extramarital affairs, and his marriage began to falter, about which he later stated: &quot;The blame was entirely mine&quot;.

McCain served as the Navy&#x27;s liaison to the U.S. Senate beginning in 1977. In retrospect, he said that this represented his &quot;real entry into the world of politics, and the beginning of my second career as a public servant.&quot; His key behind-the-scenes role gained congressional financing for a new supercarrier against the wishes of the Carter administration.

In April 1979, McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley, a teacher from Phoenix, Arizona, whose father had founded a large beer distributorship. They began dating, and he urged his wife, Carol, to grant him a divorce, which she did in February 1980; the uncontested divorce took effect in April 1980. The settlement included two houses and financial support for her ongoing medical treatments due to her 1969 car accident; they remained on good terms. McCain and Hensley were married on May 17, 1980, with Senators William Cohen and Gary Hart attending as groomsmen. McCain&#x27;s children did not attend, and several years passed before they reconciled. John and Cindy McCain entered into a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family&#x27;s assets under her name; they kept their finances separate and filed separate income tax returns.
McCain decided to leave the Navy. It was doubtful whether he would ever be promoted to the rank of full admiral, as he had poor annual physicals and had not been given a major sea command. His chances of being promoted to rear admiral were better, but he declined that prospect, as he had already made plans to run for Congress and said he could &quot;do more good there.&quot;

McCain retired from the Navy as a captain on April 1, 1981. He was designated as disabled and awarded a disability pension. Upon leaving the military, he moved to Arizona. His numerous military decorations and awards include: the Silver Star, two Legion of Merits, Distinguished Flying Cross, three Bronze Star Medals, two Purple Hearts, two Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medals, and the Prisoner of War Medal.

== House and Senate elections and career (1982–2000) ==
=== U.S. Representative ===

McCain set his sights on becoming a representative because he was interested in current events, was ready for a new challenge, and had developed political ambitions. Living in Phoenix, he went to work for his new father-in-law&#x27;s large Anheuser-Busch beer distributorship. As vice president of public relations at the distributorship, he gained political support among the local business community, meeting powerful figures such as banker Charles Keating Jr., real estate developer Fife Symington III (later Governor of Arizona) and newspaper publisher Darrow &quot;Duke&quot; Tully. In 1982, McCain ran as a Republican for an open seat in Arizona&#x27;s 1st congressional district, which was being vacated by 30-year incumbent Republican John Jacob Rhodes. A newcomer to the state, McCain was termed a carpetbagger. McCain responded to a voter making that charge with what a &quot;Phoenix Gazette&quot; columnist later described as &quot;the most devastating response to a potentially troublesome political issue I&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;:

McCain won a highly contested primary election with the assistance of local political endorsements, his Washington connections, and money that his wife lent to his campaign. He then easily won the general election in the heavily Republican district.

In 1983, McCain was elected to lead the incoming group of Republican representatives, and was assigned to the House Committee on Interior Affairs. Also that year, he opposed creation of a federal Martin Luther King Jr. Day, but admitted in 2008: &quot;I was wrong and eventually realized that, in time to give full support [in 1990] for a state holiday in Arizona.&quot;

At this point, McCain&#x27;s politics were mainly in line with those of President Ronald Reagan; this included support for Reaganomics, and he was active on Indian Affairs bills. He supported most aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including its hardline stance against the Soviet Union and policy towards Central American conflicts, such as backing the Contras in Nicaragua. McCain opposed keeping U.S. Marines deployed in Lebanon, citing unattainable objectives, and subsequently criticized President Reagan for pulling out the troops too late; in the interim, the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing killed hundreds. McCain won re-election to the House easily in 1984, and gained a spot on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1985, he made his first return trip to Vietnam, and also traveled to Chile where he met with its military junta ruler, General Augusto Pinochet.

=== Growing family ===

In 1984, McCain and Cindy had their first child, daughter Meghan, followed two years later by son John IV and in 1988 by son James. In 1991, Cindy brought an abandoned three-month-old girl needing medical treatment to the U.S. from a Bangladeshi orphanage run by Mother Teresa. The McCains decided to adopt her and named her Bridget.

=== First two terms in the U.S. Senate ===

McCain&#x27;s Senate career began in January 1987, after he defeated his Democratic opponent, former state legislator Richard Kimball, by 20 percentage points in the 1986 election. McCain succeeded Arizona native, conservative icon, and the 1964 Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater upon Goldwater&#x27;s retirement as U.S. senator from Arizona for 30 years. In January 1988, McCain voted in favor of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, and voted to override President Reagan&#x27;s veto of that legislation the following March.

Senator McCain became a member of the Armed Services Committee, with which he had formerly done his Navy liaison work; he also joined the Commerce Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee. He continued to support the Native American agenda. As first a House member and then a senator—and as a lifelong gambler with close ties to the gambling industry—McCain was one of the main authors of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which codified rules regarding Native American gambling enterprises. McCain was also a strong supporter of the Gramm–Rudman legislation that enforced automatic spending cuts in the case of budget deficits.

McCain soon gained national visibility. He delivered a well-received speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention, was mentioned by the press as a short list vice-presidential running mate for Republican nominee George H. W. Bush, and was named chairman of Veterans for Bush.

==== Keating Five ====

McCain became embroiled in a scandal during the 1980s, as one of five United States senators comprising the so-called Keating Five. Between 1982 and 1987, McCain had received $112,000 in lawful political contributions from Charles Keating Jr. and his associates at Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, along with trips on Keating&#x27;s jets that McCain belatedly repaid, in 1989. In 1987, McCain was one of the five senators whom Keating contacted to prevent the government&#x27;s seizure of Lincoln, and McCain met twice with federal regulators to discuss the government&#x27;s investigation of Lincoln. In 1999, McCain said: &quot;The appearance of it was wrong. It&#x27;s a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators, because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence. And it was the wrong thing to do.&quot; In the end, McCain was cleared by the Senate Ethics Committee of acting improperly or violating any law or Senate rule, but was mildly rebuked for exercising &quot;poor judgment&quot;.

In his 1992 re-election bid, the Keating Five affair was not a major issue, and he won handily, gaining 56 percent of the vote to defeat Democratic community and civil rights activist Claire Sargent and independent former governor, Evan Mecham.

==== Political independence ====
McCain developed a reputation for independence during the 1990s. He took pride in challenging party leadership and establishment forces, becoming difficult to categorize politically.

As a member of the 1991–1993 Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, chaired by fellow Vietnam War veteran and Democrat, John Kerry, McCain investigated the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue, to determine the fate of U.S. service personnel listed as missing in action during the Vietnam War. The committee&#x27;s unanimous report stated there was &quot;no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia.&quot; Helped by McCain&#x27;s efforts, in 1995 the U.S. normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam. McCain was vilified by some POW/MIA activists who, despite the committee&#x27;s unanimous report, believed many Americans were still held against their will in Southeast Asia. From January 1993 until his death, McCain was Chairman of the International Republican Institute, an organization that supports the emergence of political democracy worldwide.

In 1993 and 1994, McCain voted to confirm President Clinton&#x27;s nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, whom he considered qualified. He later explained that &quot;under our Constitution, it is the president&#x27;s call to make.&quot; McCain had also voted to confirm nominees of presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, including Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.

==== Campaign finance reform ====
McCain attacked what he saw as the corrupting influence of large political contributions—from corporations, labor unions, other organizations, and wealthy individuals—and he made this his signature issue. Starting in 1994, he worked with Democratic Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold on campaign finance reform; their McCain–Feingold bill attempted to put limits on &quot;soft money&quot;. The efforts of McCain and Feingold were opposed by some of the moneyed interests targeted, by incumbents in both parties, by those who felt spending limits impinged on free political speech and might be unconstitutional as well, and by those who wanted to counterbalance the power of what they saw as media bias. Despite sympathetic coverage in the media, initial versions of the McCain–Feingold Act were filibustered and never came to a vote.

The term &quot; Republican&quot; was frequently applied to McCain, and he also used it himself. In 1993, McCain opposed military operations in Somalia. Another target of his was pork barrel spending by Congress, and he actively supported the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, which gave the president power to veto individual spending items but was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1998.

In the 1996 presidential election, McCain was again on the short list of possible vice-presidential picks, this time for Republican nominee Bob Dole. While Dole instead selected Jack Kemp, he chose McCain to deliver the nominating speech for him in the presidential roll call vote at the 1996 Republican National Convention. The following year, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named McCain as one of the &quot;25 Most Influential People in America&quot;.

In 1997, McCain became chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee&#x27;s purview, but in response said the small contributions he received were not part of the big-money nature of the campaign finance problem. McCain took on the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation to increase cigarette taxes to fund anti-smoking campaigns, discourage teenage smokers, increase money for health research studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs. Supported by the Clinton administration but opposed by the industry and most Republicans, the bill failed to gain cloture.

=== Start of third term in the U.S. Senate ===

In November 1998, McCain won re-election to a third Senate term in a landslide over his Democratic opponent, environmental lawyer Ed Ranger. In the February 1999 Senate trial following the impeachment of Bill Clinton, McCain voted to convict the president on both the perjury and obstruction of justice counts, saying Clinton had violated his sworn oath of office. In March 1999, McCain voted to approve the NATO bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, saying that the ongoing genocide of the Kosovo War must be stopped and criticizing past Clinton administration inaction. Later in 1999, McCain shared the Profile in Courage Award with Feingold for their work in trying to enact their campaign finance reform, although the bill was still failing repeated attempts to gain cloture.

In August 1999, McCain&#x27;s memoir &quot;Faith of My Fathers&quot;, co-authored with Mark Salter, was published; a reviewer observed that its appearance &quot;seems to have been timed to the unfolding Presidential campaign.&quot; The most successful of his writings, it received positive reviews, became a bestseller, and was later made into a TV film. The book traces McCain&#x27;s family background and childhood, covers his time at Annapolis and his service before and during the Vietnam War, concluding with his release from captivity in 1973. According to one reviewer, it describes &quot;the kind of challenges that most of us can barely imagine. It&#x27;s a fascinating history of a remarkable military family.&quot;

== 2000 presidential campaign ==
McCain announced his candidacy for president on September 27, 1999, in Nashua, New Hampshire, saying he was staging &quot;a fight to take our government back from the power brokers and special interests, and return it to the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve&quot;. The frontrunner for the Republican nomination was Texas Governor George W. Bush, who had the political and financial support of most of the party establishment, whereas McCain was supported by many moderate Republicans and some conservative Republicans.

McCain focused on the New Hampshire primary, where his message appealed to independents. He traveled on a campaign bus called the Straight Talk Express. He held many town hall meetings, answering every question voters asked, in a successful example of &quot;retail politics&quot;, and he used free media to compensate for his lack of funds. One reporter later recounted that, &quot;McCain talked all day long with reporters on his Straight Talk Express bus; he talked so much that sometimes he said things that he shouldn&#x27;t have, and that&#x27;s why the media loved him.&quot; On February 1, 2000, he won New Hampshire&#x27;s primary with 49 percent of the vote to Bush&#x27;s 30 percent. The Bush campaign and the Republican establishment feared that a McCain victory in the crucial South Carolina primary might give his campaign unstoppable momentum.

&quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; wrote that the McCain–Bush primary contest in South Carolina &quot;has entered national political lore as a low-water mark in presidential campaigns&quot;, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a painful symbol of the brutality of American politics&quot;. A variety of interest groups, which McCain had challenged in the past, ran negative ads. Bush borrowed McCain&#x27;s earlier language of reform, and declined to dissociate himself from a veterans activist who accused McCain (in Bush&#x27;s presence) of having &quot;abandoned the veterans&quot; on POW/MIA and Agent Orange issues.

Incensed, McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to Bill Clinton, which Bush said was &quot;about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary&quot;. An anonymous smear campaign began against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, and audience plants. The smears claimed that McCain had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains&#x27; dark-skinned daughter was adopted from Bangladesh), that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, that he was a homosexual, and that he was a &quot;Manchurian Candidate&quot; who was either a traitor or mentally unstable from his POW days. The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with the attacks.

McCain lost South Carolina on February 19, with 42 percent of the vote to Bush&#x27;s 53 percent, in part because Bush mobilized the state&#x27;s evangelical voters and outspent McCain. The win allowed Bush to regain lost momentum. McCain said of the rumor spreaders, &quot;I believe that there is a special place in hell for people like those.&quot; According to one acquaintance, the South Carolina experience left him in a &quot;very dark place&quot;.

McCain&#x27;s campaign never completely recovered from his South Carolina defeat, although he did rebound partially by winning in Arizona and Michigan a few days later. He made a speech in Virginia Beach that criticized Christian leaders, including Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, as divisive conservatives, declaring &quot;we embrace the fine members of the religious conservative community. But that does not mean that we will pander to their self-appointed leaders.&quot; McCain lost the Virginia primary on February 29, and on March7 lost nine of the thirteen primaries on Super Tuesday to Bush. With little hope of overcoming Bush&#x27;s delegate lead, McCain withdrew from the race on March 9, 2000. He endorsed Bush two months later.

== Senate career (2000–2008) ==
=== Remainder of third Senate term ===

McCain began 2001 by breaking with the new administration on a number of matters, including HMO reform, climate change, and gun control legislation; McCain–Feingold was opposed by Bush as well. In May 2001, McCain was one of only two Senate Republicans to vote against the Bush tax cuts. Besides the differences with Bush on ideological grounds, there was considerable antagonism between the two remaining from the previous year&#x27;s campaign. When a Republican senator, Jim Jeffords, became an Independent, thereby throwing control of the Senate to the Democrats, McCain defended Jeffords against &quot;self-appointed enforcers of party loyalty&quot;. Indeed, there was speculation at the time, and in years since, about McCain himself leaving the Republican Party, but McCain had always adamantly denied that he ever considered doing so. Beginning in 2001, McCain used political capital gained from his presidential run, as well as improved legislative skills and relationships with other members, to become one of the Senate&#x27;s most influential members.

After the September 11 attacks in 2001, McCain supported Bush and the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan. He and Democratic senator Joe Lieberman wrote the legislation that created the 9/11 Commission, while he and Democratic senator Fritz Hollings co-sponsored the Aviation and Transportation Security Act that federalized airport security.

In March 2002, McCain–Feingold, officially known as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, passed in both Houses of Congress and was signed into law. It was McCain&#x27;s greatest legislative achievement.

Meanwhile, in discussions over proposed U.S. action against Iraq, McCain was a strong supporter of the Bush administration&#x27;s position. He stated that Iraq was &quot;a clear and present danger&quot; to the U.S., and voted for the Iraq War Resolution in October 2002. He predicted that U.S. forces would be treated as liberators by many Iraqi people. In May 2003, McCain voted against the second round of Bush tax cuts, saying it was unwise at a time of war. By November 2003, after a trip to Iraq, he was publicly questioning Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, saying that more U.S. troops were needed; the following year, McCain announced that he had lost confidence in Rumsfeld.

In October 2003, McCain and Lieberman co-sponsored the Climate Stewardship Act that would have introduced a cap and trade system aimed at returning greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels; the bill was defeated with 55 votes to 43 in the Senate. They reintroduced modified versions of the Act two additional times, for the final time in January 2007 with the co-sponsorship of Barack Obama, among others.

In the 2004 U.S. presidential election campaign, McCain was frequently mentioned for the vice-presidential slot, only this time as part of the Democratic ticket under nominee John Kerry. McCain said that Kerry had never formally offered him the position and that he would not have accepted it. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, McCain supported Bush for re-election, praising Bush&#x27;s management of the War on Terror since the September 11 attacks. At the same time, he defended Kerry&#x27;s Vietnam War record. By August 2004, McCain had the best favorable-to-unfavorable rating (55 percent to 19 percent) of any national politician; he campaigned for Bush much more than he had four years previously, though the two remained situational allies rather than friends.

McCain was also up for re-election as senator, in 2004. He defeated little-known Democratic schoolteacher Stuart Starky with his biggest margin of victory, garnering 77 percent of the vote.

=== Start of fourth Senate term ===

In May 2005, McCain led the so-called Gang of 14 in the Senate, which established a compromise that preserved the ability of senators to filibuster judicial nominees, but only in &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot;. The compromise took the steam out of the filibuster movement, but some Republicans remained disappointed that the compromise did not eliminate filibusters of judicial nominees in all circumstances. McCain subsequently cast Supreme Court confirmation votes in favor of John Roberts and Samuel Alito, calling them &quot;two of the finest justices ever appointed to the United States Supreme Court.&quot;

Breaking from his 2001 and 2003 votes, McCain supported the Bush tax cut extension in May 2006, saying not to do so would amount to a tax increase. Working with Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy, McCain was a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform, which would involve legalization, guest worker programs, and border enforcement components. The Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act was never voted on in 2005, while the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 passed the Senate in May 2006 but failed in the House. In June 2007, President Bush, McCain, and others made the strongest push yet for such a bill, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, but it aroused intense grassroots opposition among talk radio listeners and others, some of whom furiously characterized the proposal as an &quot;amnesty&quot; program, and the bill twice failed to gain cloture in the Senate.

By the middle of the 2000s (decade), the increased Indian gaming that McCain had helped bring about was a $23 billion industry. He was twice chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, in 1995–1997 and 2005–2007, and his Committee helped expose the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal. By 2005 and 2006, McCain was pushing for amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act which would have limited creation of off-reservation casinos, and also limited the movement of tribes across state lines to build casinos.

Owing to his time as a POW, McCain was recognized for his sensitivity to the detention and interrogation of detainees in the War on Terror. An opponent of the Bush administration&#x27;s use of torture and detention without trial at Guantánamo Bay, saying: &quot;some of these guys are terrible, terrible killers and the worst kind of scum of humanity. But, one, they deserve to have some adjudication of their cases... even Adolf Eichmann got a trial&quot;. In October 2005, McCain introduced the McCain Detainee Amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill for 2005, and the Senate voted 90–9 to support the amendment. It prohibits inhumane treatment of prisoners, including prisoners at Guantánamo, by confining military interrogations to the techniques in the U.S. Army Field Manual on Interrogation. Although Bush had threatened to veto the bill if McCain&#x27;s amendment was included, the President announced in December 2005 that he accepted McCain&#x27;s terms and would &quot;make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture, whether it be here at home or abroad&quot;. This stance, among others, led to McCain being named by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2006 as one of America&#x27;s 10 Best Senators. McCain voted in February 2008 against a bill containing a ban on waterboarding, which provision was later narrowly passed and vetoed by Bush. However, the bill in question contained other provisions to which McCain objected, and his spokesman stated: &quot;This wasn&#x27;t a vote on waterboarding. This was a vote on applying the standards of the [Army] field manual to CIA personnel.&quot;

Meanwhile, McCain continued questioning the progress of the war in Iraq. In September 2005, he remarked upon Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers&#x27; optimistic outlook on the war&#x27;s progress: &quot;Things have not gone as well as we had planned or expected, nor as we were told by you, General Myers.&quot; In August 2006, he criticized the administration for continually understating the effectiveness of the insurgency: &quot;We [have] not told the American people how tough and difficult this could be.&quot; From the beginning, McCain strongly supported the Iraq troop surge of 2007. The strategy&#x27;s opponents labeled it &quot;McCain&#x27;s plan&quot; and University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato said, &quot;McCain owns Iraq just as much as Bush does now.&quot; The surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year, even within the Republican Party, as McCain&#x27;s presidential campaign was underway; faced with the consequences, McCain frequently responded, &quot;I would much rather lose a campaign than a war.&quot; In March 2008, McCain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in Iraq, as he made his eighth trip to that country since the war began.

== 2008 presidential campaign ==


McCain formally announced his intention to run for President of the United States on April 25, 2007, in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. He stated that: &quot;I&#x27;m not running for president to be somebody, but to do something; to do the hard but necessary things, not the easy and needless things.&quot;

McCain&#x27;s oft-cited strengths as a presidential candidate for 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives, his ability to reach across the aisle, his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and an expectation that he would capture Bush&#x27;s top fundraisers. During the 2006 election cycle, McCain had attended 346 events and helped raise more than $10.5 million on behalf of Republican candidates. McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions, while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make. Despite being considered the front-runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began, McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in national Republican polls as the year progressed.

McCain had fundraising problems in the first half of 2007, due in part to his support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was unpopular among the Republican base electorate. Large-scale campaign staff downsizing took place in early July, but McCain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race. Later that month, the candidate&#x27;s campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed. McCain slumped badly in national polls, often running third or fourth with 15 percent or less support.

The Arizona senator subsequently resumed his familiar position as a political underdog, riding the Straight Talk Express and taking advantage of free media such as debates and sponsored events. By December 2007, the Republican race was unsettled, with none of the top-tier candidates dominating the race and all of them possessing major vulnerabilities with different elements of the Republican base electorate. McCain was showing a resurgence, in particular with renewed strength in New Hampshire—the scene of his 2000 triumph—and was bolstered further by the endorsements from &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, the &quot;New Hampshire Union Leader&quot;, and almost two dozen other state newspapers, as well as from Senator Lieberman (now an Independent Democrat). McCain decided not to campaign significantly in the January 3, 2008, Iowa caucuses, which saw a win by former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee.

McCain&#x27;s comeback plan paid off when he won the New Hampshire primary on January 8, defeating former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney in a close contest, to once again become one of the front-runners in the race. In mid-January, McCain placed first in the South Carolina primary, narrowly defeating Mike Huckabee. Pundits credited the third-place finisher, Tennessee&#x27;s former U.S. Senator Fred Thompson, with drawing votes from Huckabee in South Carolina, thereby giving a narrow win to McCain.
A week later, McCain won the Florida primary, beating Romney again in a close contest; Giuliani then dropped out and endorsed McCain.

On February 5, McCain won both the majority of states and delegates in the Super Tuesday Republican primaries, giving him a commanding lead toward the Republican nomination. Romney departed from the race on February7. McCain&#x27;s wins in the March4 primaries clinched a majority of the delegates, and he became the presumptive Republican nominee.

Had he been elected, he would have become the first president physically born outside the United States. This raised a potential legal issue, since the United States Constitution requires the president to be a natural-born citizen. A bipartisan legal review, and a unanimous but non-binding Senate resolution, both concluded that he was a natural-born citizen. However, other legal scholars came to the opposite conclusion that although he was a citizen, at the time of his birth he was not a natural-born citizen, because the 1937 law that made him a citizen was passed one year after his birth.

If inaugurated in 2009 at the age of 72 years and 144 days, he would have been the oldest person to become president. McCain addressed concerns about his age and past health issues, stating in 2005 that his health was &quot;excellent&quot;. He had been treated for melanoma and an operation in 2000 for that condition left a noticeable mark on the left side of his face. McCain&#x27;s prognosis appeared favorable, according to independent experts, especially because he had already survived without a recurrence for more than seven years. In May 2008, McCain&#x27;s campaign briefly let the press review his medical records, and he was described as appearing cancer-free, having a strong heart, and in general being in good health.

McCain clinched enough delegates for the nomination and his focus shifted toward the general election, while Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton fought a prolonged battle for the Democratic nomination. McCain introduced various policy proposals, and sought to improve his fundraising. Cindy McCain, who accounted for most of the couple&#x27;s wealth with an estimated net worth of $100 million, made part of her tax returns public in May. After facing criticism about lobbyists on staff, the McCain campaign issued new rules in May 2008 to avoid conflicts of interest, causing five top aides to leave.

When Obama became the Democrats&#x27; presumptive nominee in early June, McCain proposed joint town hall meetings, but Obama instead requested more traditional debates for the fall. In July, a staff shake-up put Steve Schmidt in full operational control of the McCain campaign. Rick Davis remained as campaign manager but with a reduced role. Davis had also managed McCain&#x27;s 2000 presidential campaign; in 2005 and 2006, U.S. intelligence warned McCain&#x27;s Senate staff about Davis&#x27;s Russian links but gave no further warnings.

Throughout the summer of 2008, Obama typically led McCain in national polls by single-digit margins, and also led in several key swing states. McCain reprised his familiar underdog role, which was due at least in part to the overall challenges Republicans faced in the election year. McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign, and the restrictions that go with it, while criticizing his Democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976. The Republican&#x27;s broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead, compared to Obama&#x27;s.

On August 29, 2008, McCain revealed Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his surprise choice for a running mate. McCain was only the second U.S. major-party presidential nominee (after Walter Mondale, who chose Geraldine Ferraro) to select a woman as his running mate and the first Republican to do so. On September 3, 2008, McCain and Palin became the Republican Party&#x27;s presidential and vice presidential nominees at the 2008 Republican National Convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota. McCain surged ahead of Obama in national polls following the convention, as the Palin pick energized core Republican voters who had previously been wary of him. However, by the campaign&#x27;s own later admission, the rollout of Palin to the national media went poorly, and voter reactions to Palin grew increasingly negative, especially among independents and other voters concerned about her qualifications.

McCain&#x27;s decision to choose Sarah Palin as his running mate was criticized; &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist David Brooks said that &quot;he took a disease that was running through the Republican party – anti-intellectualism, disrespect for facts – and he put it right at the centre of the party&quot;. Laura McGann in &quot;Vox&quot; says that McCain gave the &quot;reality TV politics&quot; and Tea Party movement more political legitimacy, as well as solidifying &quot;the Republican Party&#x27;s comfort with a candidate who would say absurdities... unleashing a political style and a values system that animated the Tea Party movement and laid the groundwork for a Trump presidency.&quot; Although McCain later expressed regret for not choosing the independent Senator Joe Lieberman (who had previously been Al Gore&#x27;s running mate in 2000, while still elected as a Democrat) as his VP candidate instead, he consistently defended Palin&#x27;s performances at his events.

On September 24, McCain said he was temporarily suspending his campaign activities, called on Obama to join him, and proposed delaying the first of the general election debates with Obama, to work on the proposed U.S. financial system bailout before Congress, which was targeted at addressing the subprime mortgage crisis and the financial crisis of 2007–2008. McCain&#x27;s intervention helped to give dissatisfied House Republicans an opportunity to propose changes to the plan that was otherwise close to agreement. After Obama declined McCain&#x27;s suspension suggestion, McCain went ahead with the debate on September 26. On October 1, McCain voted in favor of a revised $700 billion rescue plan. Another debate was held on October 7; like the first one, polls afterward suggested that Obama had won it. A final presidential debate occurred on October 15. Down the stretch, McCain was outspent by Obama by a four-to-one margin.

During and after the final debate, McCain compared Obama&#x27;s proposed policies to socialism and often invoked &quot;Joe the Plumber&quot; as a symbol of American small business dreams that would be thwarted by an Obama presidency. He barred using the Jeremiah Wright controversy in ads against Obama, but the campaign did frequently criticize Obama regarding his purported relationship with Bill Ayers. McCain&#x27;s rallies became increasingly vitriolic, with attendees denigrating Obama and displaying a growing anti-Muslim and anti-African-American sentiment. During a campaign rally in Minnesota, Gayle Quinnell, a McCain supporter, told him she did not trust Obama because &quot;he&#x27;s an Arab&quot;. McCain replied, &quot;No ma&#x27;am. He&#x27;s a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.&quot; McCain&#x27;s response was considered one of the finer moments of the campaign and was still being viewed several years later as a marker for civility in American politics, particularly in light of the anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant animus of the Donald Trump presidency. Meghan McCain said that she cannot &quot;go a day without someone bringing up (that) moment,&quot; and noted that at the time &quot;there were a lot of people really trying to get my dad to go (against Obama) with... you&#x27;re a Muslim, you&#x27;re not an American aspect of that,&quot; but that her father had refused. &quot;I can remember thinking that it was a morally amazing and beautiful moment, but that maybe there would be people in the Republican Party that would be quite angry,&quot; she said.

The election took place on November 4, and Barack Obama was declared the projected winner at about 11:00 pm Eastern Standard Time; McCain delivered his concession speech in Phoenix, Arizona, about twenty minutes later. In it, he noted the historic and special significance of Obama being elected the nation&#x27;s first African American president. McCain remarked, &quot;Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans; and please believe me when I say, no association has ever meant more to me than that.&quot; In the end, McCain won 173 electoral votes to Obama&#x27;s 365; McCain failed to win most of the battleground states and lost some traditionally Republican ones. McCain gained 46 percent of the nationwide popular vote, compared to Obama&#x27;s 53 percent.

== Senate career after 2008 ==
=== Remainder of fourth Senate term ===

Following his defeat, McCain returned to the Senate amid varying views about what role he might play there. McCain indicated that he intended to run for re-election to his Senate seat in 2010. As the inauguration neared, Obama consulted with McCain on a variety of matters, to an extent rarely seen between a president-elect and his defeated rival, and President Obama&#x27;s inauguration speech contained an allusion to McCain&#x27;s theme of finding a purpose greater than oneself.

Nevertheless, McCain emerged as a leader of the Republican opposition to the Obama economic stimulus package of 2009, saying it incorporated federal policy changes that had nothing to do with near-term job creation and would expand the growing federal budget deficit. McCain also voted against Obama&#x27;s Supreme Court nomination of Sonia Sotomayor—saying that while undeniably qualified, &quot;I do not believe that she shares my belief in judicial restraint&quot;—and by August 2009 was siding more often with his Republican Party on closely divided votes than ever before in his senatorial career. McCain reasserted that the War in Afghanistan was winnable and criticized Obama for a slow process in deciding whether to send additional troops there.

McCain also harshly criticized Obama for scrapping construction of the U.S. missile defense complex in Poland, declined to enter negotiations over climate change legislation similar to what he had proposed in the past, and strongly opposed the Obama health care plan. McCain led a successful filibuster of a measure that would allow repeal of the military&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy towards gays. Factors involved in McCain&#x27;s new direction included Senate staffers leaving, a renewed concern over national debt levels and the scope of federal government, a possible Republican primary challenge from conservatives in 2010, and McCain&#x27;s campaign edge being slow to wear off. As one longtime McCain advisor said, &quot;A lot of people, including me, thought he might be the Republican building bridges to the Obama Administration. But he&#x27;s been more like the guy blowing up the bridges.&quot;

In early 2010, a primary challenge from radio talk show host and former U.S. Congressman J. D. Hayworth materialized in the Senate election in Arizona and drew support from some but not all elements of the Tea Party movement. With Hayworth using the campaign slogan &quot;The Consistent Conservative&quot;, McCain said—despite his own past use of the term on a number of occasions—&quot;I never considered myself a maverick. I consider myself a person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities.&quot; The primary challenge coincided with McCain reversing or muting his stance on some issues such as the bank bailouts, closing of the Guantánamo Bay detention camp, campaign finance restrictions, and gays in the military.

When the health care plan, now called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed Congress and became law in March 2010, McCain strongly opposed the landmark legislation not only on its merits but also on the way it had been handled in Congress. As a consequence, he warned that congressional Republicans would not work with Democrats on anything else: &quot;There will be no cooperation for the rest of the year. They have poisoned the well in what they&#x27;ve done and how they&#x27;ve done it.&quot; McCain became a vocal defender of Arizona SB 1070, the April 2010 tough anti-illegal immigration state law that aroused national controversy, saying that the state had been forced to take action given the federal government&#x27;s inability to control the border. In the August 24 primary, McCain beat Hayworth by a 56 to 32 percent margin. McCain easily defeated Democratic Tucson city councilman Rodney Glassman in the general election.

In the lame duck session of the 111th Congress, McCain voted for the compromise Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, but against the DREAM Act (which he had once sponsored) and the New START Treaty. Most prominently, he continued to lead the eventually losing fight against &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; repeal. In his opposition, he sometimes fell into anger or hostility on the Senate floor, and called its passage &quot;a very sad day&quot; that would compromise the battle effectiveness of the military.

=== Fifth Senate term ===

While control of the House of Representatives went over to the Republicans in the 112th Congress, the Senate stayed Democratic and McCain continued to be the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. As the Arab Spring took center stage, McCain urged that the embattled Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, step down and thought the U.S. should push for democratic reforms in the region despite the associated risks of religious extremists gaining power. McCain was an especially vocal supporter of the 2011 military intervention in Libya. In April of that year he visited the Anti-Gaddafi forces and National Transitional Council in Benghazi, the highest-ranking American to do so, and said that the rebel forces were &quot;my heroes&quot;. In June, he joined with Senator Kerry in offering a resolution that would have authorized the military intervention, and said: &quot;The administration&#x27;s disregard for the elected representatives of the American people on this matter has been troubling and counterproductive.&quot; In August, McCain voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011 that resolved the U.S. debt ceiling crisis. In November, McCain and Senator Carl Levin were leaders in efforts to codify in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 that terrorism suspects, no matter where captured, could be detained by the U.S. military and its tribunal system; following objections by civil libertarians, some Democrats, and the White House, McCain and Levin agreed to language making it clear that the bill would not pertain to U.S. citizens.

In the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries, McCain endorsed former 2008 rival Mitt Romney and campaigned for him, but compared the contest to a Greek tragedy due to its drawn-out nature with massive super PAC-funded attack ads damaging all the contenders. He labeled the Supreme Court&#x27;s 2010 &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot; decision as &quot;uninformed, arrogant, naïve&quot;, and, decrying its effects and the future scandals he thought it would bring, said it would become considered the court&#x27;s &quot;worst decision... in the 21st century&quot;. McCain took the lead in opposing the defense spending sequestrations brought on by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and gained attention for defending State Department aide Huma Abedin against charges brought by a few House Republicans that she had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.

McCain continued to be one of the most frequently appearing guests on the Sunday morning news talk shows.
He became one of the most vocal critics of the Obama administration&#x27;s handling of the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, saying it was a &quot;debacle&quot; that featured either &quot;a massive cover-up or incompetence that is not acceptable&quot; and that it was worse than the Watergate scandal. As an outgrowth of this strong opposition, he and a few other senators were successful in blocking the planned nomination of Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton as U.S. Secretary of State; McCain&#x27;s friend John Kerry was nominated instead.

Regarding the Syrian civil war that had begun in 2011, McCain repeatedly argued for the U.S. intervening militarily in the conflict on the side of the anti-government forces. He staged a visit to rebel forces inside Syria in May 2013, the first senator to do so, and called for arming the Free Syrian Army with heavy weapons and for the establishment of a no-fly zone over the country. Following reports that two of the people he posed for pictures with had been responsible for the kidnapping of eleven Lebanese Shiite pilgrims the year before, McCain disputed one of the identifications and said he had not met directly with the other. Following the 2013 Ghouta chemical weapons attack, McCain argued again for strong American military action against the government of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and in September 2013 cast a Foreign Relations committee vote in favor of Obama&#x27;s request to Congress that it authorize a military response. McCain took the lead in criticizing a growing non-interventionist movement within the Republican Party, exemplified by his March 2013 comment that Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz and Representative Justin Amash were &quot;wacko birds&quot;.

During 2013, McCain was a member of a bi-partisan group of senators, the &quot;Gang of Eight&quot;, which announced principles for another try at comprehensive immigration reform. The resulting Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 passed the Senate by a 68–32 margin, but faced an uncertain future in the House. In July 2013, McCain was at the forefront of an agreement among senators to drop filibusters against Obama administration executive nominees without Democrats resorting to the &quot;nuclear option&quot; that would disallow such filibusters altogether. However, the option would be imposed later in the year anyway, to the senator&#x27;s displeasure. These developments and some other negotiations showed that McCain had become the leader of a power center in the Senate for cutting deals in an otherwise bitterly partisan environment. They also led some observers to conclude that the &quot;maverick&quot; McCain had returned.

McCain was publicly skeptical about the Republican strategy that precipitated the U.S. federal government shutdown of 2013 and U.S. debt-ceiling crisis of 2013 to defund or delay the Affordable Care Act; in October 2013 he voted in favor of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, which resolved them and said, &quot;Republicans have to understand we have lost this battle, as I predicted weeks ago, that we would not be able to win because we were demanding something that was not achievable.&quot; He was one of nine Republican senators who voted for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 at the end of the year. By early 2014, McCain&#x27;s apostasies were enough that the Arizona Republican Party formally censured him for having what they saw as a liberal record that had been &quot;disastrous and harmful&quot;. McCain remained stridently opposed to many aspects of Obama&#x27;s foreign policy, however, and in June 2014, following major gains by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, decried what he saw as a U.S. failure to protect its past gains in Iraq and called on the president&#x27;s entire national security team to resign. McCain said, &quot;Could all this have been avoided?... The answer is absolutely yes. If I sound angry it&#x27;s because I am angry.&quot;

McCain was a supporter of the Euromaidan protests against Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych and his government, and appeared in Independence Square in Kyiv in December 2013. Following the overthrow of Yanukovych and subsequent 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, McCain became a vocal supporter of providing arms to Ukrainian military forces, saying the sanctions imposed against Russia were not enough. In 2014, McCain led the opposition to the appointments of Colleen Bell, Noah Mamet, and George Tsunis to the ambassadorships in Hungary, Argentina, and Norway, respectively, arguing they were unqualified. Unlike many Republicans, McCain supported the release and contents of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture in December 2014, saying &quot;The truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow. It sometimes causes us difficulties at home and abroad. It is sometimes used by our enemies in attempts to hurt us. But the American people are entitled to it, nonetheless.&quot; He added that the CIA&#x27;s practices following the September 11 attacks had &quot;stained our national honor&quot; while doing &quot;much harm and little practical good&quot; and that &quot;Our enemies act without conscience. We must not.&quot; He opposed the Obama administration&#x27;s December 2014 decision to normalize relations with Cuba.

The 114th United States Congress assembled in January 2015 with Republicans in control of the Senate, and McCain achieved one of his longtime goals when he became chairman of the Armed Services Committee. In this position, he led the writing of proposed Senate legislation that sought to modify parts of the Goldwater–Nichols Act of 1986 to return responsibility for major weapons systems acquisition back to the individual armed services and their secretaries and away from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. As chair, McCain tried to maintain a bipartisan approach and forged a good relationship with ranking member Jack Reed. In April 2015, McCain announced that he would run for a sixth term in Arizona&#x27;s 2016 Senate election. During 2015, McCain strongly opposed the Obama administration&#x27;s proposed comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear program (later finalized as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)), saying that Secretary of State Kerry was &quot;delusional&quot; and &quot;giv[ing] away the store&quot; in negotiations with Iran. McCain supported the Saudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen against the Houthis and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh.

McCain accused President Obama of being &quot;directly responsible&quot; for the Orlando nightclub shooting &quot;because when he pulled everybody out of Iraq, al-Qaeda went to Syria, became ISIS, and ISIS is what it is today thanks to Barack Obama&#x27;s failures.&quot;

During the 2016 Republican primaries, McCain said he would support the Republican nominee even if it was Donald Trump, in spite of his personal disagreements with Trump.

However, following Mitt Romney&#x27;s 2016 anti-Trump speech, McCain endorsed the sentiments expressed in that speech, saying he had serious concerns about Trump&#x27;s &quot;uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on national security issues&quot;. Relations between the two had been fraught since early in Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign, when McCain referred to a room full of Trump supporters as &quot;crazies&quot;, and the real estate mogul then said of McCain: &quot;He insulted me, and he insulted everyone in that room... He is a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren&#x27;t captured... perhaps he was a war hero, but right now he&#x27;s said a lot of very bad things about a lot of people.&quot; This was widely condemned by much of the Republican Party, with Senator Marco Rubio referring to Trump&#x27;s comments as &quot;offensive rantings&quot;, commentator Rick Santorum tweeting that &quot;@SenJohnMcCain is an American hero, period&quot;, and Governor Scott Walker using the comments as the basis for his denunciation of Trump in a campaign event in Sioux City. Following Trump becoming the presumptive nominee of the party on May 3, McCain said that Republican voters had spoken and he would support Trump.

McCain himself faced a primary challenge from Kelli Ward, a fervent Trump supporter, and then was expected to face a potentially strong challenge from Democratic Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick in the general election. The senator privately expressed worry over the effect that Trump&#x27;s unpopularity among Hispanic voters might have on his own chances but also was concerned with more conservative pro-Trump voters; he thus kept his endorsement of Trump in place but tried to speak of him as little as possible given their disagreements. However McCain defeated Ward in the primary by a double-digit percentage point margin and gained a similar lead over Kirkpatrick in general election polls, and when the Donald Trump &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; controversy broke, he felt secure enough to on October8 withdraw his endorsement of Trump. McCain stated that Trump&#x27;s &quot;demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults&quot; made it &quot;impossible to continue to offer even conditional support&quot; and added that he would not vote for Hillary Clinton, but would instead &quot;write in the name of some good conservative Republican who is qualified to be president.&quot; McCain defeated Kirkpatrick, securing a sixth term as United States Senator from Arizona.

In November 2016, McCain obtained a copy of a dossier regarding the Trump presidential campaign&#x27;s links to Russia compiled by Christopher Steele. In December 2016, McCain passed on the dossier to FBI Director James Comey. McCain later wrote that he felt the dossier&#x27;s &quot;allegations were disturbing&quot; but unverifiable by himself, so he let the FBI investigate.

=== Sixth and final Senate term ===
McCain chaired the January 5, 2017, hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee where Republican and Democratic senators and intelligence officers, including James R. Clapper Jr., the Director of National Intelligence, Michael S. Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command presented a &quot;united front&quot; that &quot;forcefully reaffirmed the conclusion that the Russian government used hacking and leaks to try to influence the presidential election.&quot;

McCain visited the American missile destroyer USS John S McCain, which docked in Vietnam on 2 June 2017.

In June 2017, McCain voted to support President Trump&#x27;s controversial arms deal with Saudi Arabia.

Repeal and replacement of Obamacare was a centerpiece of McCain&#x27;s 2016 re-election campaign, and in July 2017, he said, &quot;Have no doubt: Congress must replace Obamacare, which has hit Arizonans with some of the highest premium increases in the nation and left 14 of Arizona&#x27;s 15 counties with only one provider option on the exchanges this year.&quot;

In September 2017, as the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar became ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya Muslim minority, McCain announced moves to scrap planned future military cooperation with Myanmar.

In October 2017, McCain praised President Trump&#x27;s decision to decertify Iran&#x27;s compliance with the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA) while not yet withdrawing the U.S. from the agreement, saying that the Obama-era policy failed &quot;to meet the multifaceted threat Iran poses. The goals President Trump presented in his speech today are a welcomed long overdue change.&quot;

==== Brain tumor diagnosis and surgery ====
On July 14, 2017, McCain underwent a minimally invasive craniotomy at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, to remove a blood clot above his left eye. His absence prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to delay a vote on the Better Care Reconciliation Act. Five days later, Mayo Clinic doctors announced the presence of a glioblastoma, which is a very aggressive cancerous brain tumor. Even with treatment, average survival time is approximately 14 months. McCain was a survivor of previous cancers, including melanoma.

President Donald Trump publicly wished Senator McCain well, as did many others, including former president Obama. On July 19, McCain&#x27;s senatorial office issued a statement that he &quot;appreciates the outpouring of support he has received over the last few days. He is in good spirits as he continues to recover at home ... and is confident that any future treatment will be effective.&quot;

==== Return to the Senate ====
McCain returned to the Senate on July 25, less than two weeks after brain surgery. He cast a deciding vote allowing the Senate to begin consideration of bills to replace the Affordable Care Act. He delivered a speech criticizing the party-line voting process and urged a &quot;return to regular order&quot; using the usual committee hearings and deliberations. On July 28, he cast the decisive vote against the Republicans&#x27; final proposal that month, the so-called &quot;skinny repeal&quot; option, which failed 49–51. McCain supported the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

McCain did not vote in the Senate after December 2017, remaining in Arizona to undergo cancer treatment. On April 15, 2018, he underwent surgery for an infection relating to diverticulitis.

== Death and funeral ==
On August 24, 2018, McCain&#x27;s family announced that he would no longer receive treatment for his cancer. He died the following day at his home in Cornville, Arizona.

McCain lay in state in the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix on August 29, which would have been his 82nd birthday. This was followed by a service at North Phoenix Baptist Church on August 30. His remains were then moved to Washington, D.C., to lie in state in the United States Capitol rotunda on August 31, which was followed by a service at the Washington National Cathedral on September 1. He was a &quot;lifelong Episcopalian&quot; who attended, but did not join, a Southern Baptist church for at least 17 years; memorial services were scheduled in both denominations.

Prior to his death, McCain requested that former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama deliver eulogies at his funeral and asked that neither President Donald Trump nor his former running mate Sarah Palin attend any of the services. McCain himself planned the funeral arrangements and selected his pallbearers for the service in Washington, including former vice president and former Delaware Senator (and future president) Joe Biden, former Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold, former Secretary of Defense William Cohen, actor Warren Beatty, and Russian dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza.

Multiple foreign leaders attended McCain&#x27;s service: Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko, Speaker of Taiwan&#x27;s Congress Su Jia-chyuan, National Defense Minister of Canada Harjit Sajjan, defense minister Jüri Luik and foreign minister Sven Mikser of Estonia, Foreign Minister of Latvia Edgars Rinkēvičs, Foreign Minister of Lithuania Linas Antanas Linkevičius, and Foreign Affairs Minister of Saudi Arabia Adel al-Jubeir.

Dignitaries who gave eulogies at the Memorial Service in Washington National Cathedral included Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Henry Kissinger, Joe Lieberman, and his daughter Meghan McCain. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described the service as the biggest meeting of anti-Trump figures during his presidency.
Those who attended the funeral included former United States presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton; First Ladies Michelle Obama, Laura Bush, Hillary Clinton; and former vice presidents Joe Biden, Dick Cheney, Al Gore, and Dan Quayle. Former president Jimmy Carter and former vice president Walter Mondale did not attend; former president George H. W. Bush was too ill to attend the service; and President Trump was not invited. Other attendees included Tom Brokaw, Charlie Rose, Bob Dole, Madeleine Albright, John Kerry, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Mitt Romney, Lindsey Graham, Warren Beatty, Elizabeth Warren, Jay Leno, and Kamala Harris. President Trump&#x27;s daughter and son-in-law Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner attended to the displeasure of Meghan McCain.
On September 2, the funeral cortege traveled from Washington, D.C., through Annapolis, Maryland, to the Naval Academy. A private service was held at the Naval Academy Chapel and McCain was buried at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) announced that he would introduce a resolution to rename the Russell Senate Office Building after McCain. A quarter peal of Grandsire Caters in memory of McCain was rung by the bellringers of Washington National Cathedral the day following his death. Another memorial quarter peal was rung on September6 on the Bells of Congress at the Old Post Office in Washington.

President Trump reportedly rejected the White House&#x27;s plans to release a statement praising McCain&#x27;s life and initially said nothing about McCain himself in a tweet that extended condolences to McCain&#x27;s family. The flag at the White House, which had been lowered to half-staff the day of McCain&#x27;s death (August 25), was raised back to full-staff at 12:01 a.m. on August 27. Trump reportedly felt that media coverage of McCain&#x27;s death was excessive given that McCain was never elected president. Following public backlash from the American Legion and AMVETS, Trump ordered the White House flag back to half-staff later on August 27. Trump issued a statement praising McCain&#x27;s service to the country, and he signed a proclamation ordering flags to be flown at half-staff until McCain&#x27;s interment.

== Political positions ==

Various advocacy groups have given McCain scores or grades as to how well his votes align with the positions of each group. CrowdPac, which rates politicians based on donations made and received, gave Senator McCain a score of 4.3C with 10C being the most conservative and 10L being the most liberal.

The non-partisan &quot;National Journal&quot; rates a Senator&#x27;s votes by what percentage of the Senate voted more liberally than him or her, and what percentage more conservatively, in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005–2006 (as reported in the 2008 &quot;Almanac of American Politics&quot;), McCain&#x27;s average ratings were as follows: economic policy: 59 percent conservative and 41 percent liberal; social policy: 54 percent conservative and 38 percent liberal; and foreign policy: 56 percent conservative and 43 percent liberal. In 2012, the &quot;National Journal&quot; gave McCain a composite score of 73 percent conservative and 27 percent liberal, while in 2013 he received a composite score of 60 percent conservative and 40 percent liberal.

Columnists such as Robert Robb and Matthew Continetti used a formulation devised by William F. Buckley Jr. to describe McCain as &quot;conservative&quot; but not &quot;a conservative&quot;, meaning that while McCain usually tended towards conservative positions, he was not &quot;anchored by the philosophical tenets of modern American conservatism&quot;. Following his 2008 presidential election loss, McCain began adopting more orthodox conservative views; the magazine &quot;National Journal&quot; rated McCain along with seven of his colleagues as the &quot;most conservative&quot; Senators for 2010 and he achieved a 100 percent rating from the American Conservative Union for that year. During Barack Obama&#x27;s presidency, McCain was one of the top five Republicans most likely to vote with Obama&#x27;s position on significant votes; McCain voted with Obama&#x27;s position on such votes more than half the time in 2013 and was &quot;censured by the Arizona Republican party for a so-called &#x27;liberal&#x27; voting record&quot;.

From the late 1990s until 2008, McCain was a board member of Project Vote Smart which was set up by Richard Kimball, his 1986 Senate opponent. The project provides non-partisan information about the political positions of McCain and other candidates for political office. Additionally, McCain used his Senate website to describe his political positions.

In his 2008 speech to the CPAC McCain stated that he believed in &quot;small government; fiscal discipline; low taxes; a strong defense, judges who enforce, and not make, our laws; the social values that are the true source of our strength; and, generally, the steadfast defense of our rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&quot;

In his 2018 memoir &quot;The Restless Wave&quot; he described himself as &quot;a proponent of lower taxes, less government, free markets, free trade, defense readiness, and democratic internationalism.&quot;

== Cultural and political image ==

McCain&#x27;s personal character was a dominant feature of his public image. This image includes the military service of both himself and his family, the circumstances and tensions surrounding the end of his first marriage and beginning of second, his maverick political persona, his temper, his admitted problem of occasional ill-considered remarks, and his close ties to his children from both his marriages. Perhaps the most egregious of McCain&#x27;s &quot;occasional ill-considered remarks&quot; was his widely condemned 2000 comment that, &quot;I hate the gooks. I will hate them as long as I live.&quot; Although McCain claimed he was referring only to his captors and guards, his comments were poorly received by the Asian-American community. His use of a racial slur was also seen as a continuation of a long history of anti-Asian sentiment in America. In his years as a Senator, McCain took more than 20 trips to Vietnam, repeatedly visiting the place of his captivity. After his death, former Vietnamese ambassador to the United States described him as &quot;a great friend to Vietnam.&quot;

McCain&#x27;s political appeal was more nonpartisan and less ideological compared to many other national politicians. His stature and reputation stemmed partly from his service in the Vietnam War. He also carried physical vestiges of his war wounds, as well as his melanoma surgery. When campaigning, he quipped: &quot;I am older than dirt and have more scars than Frankenstein.&quot;

Writers often extolled McCain for his courage not just in war but in politics, and wrote sympathetically about him. McCain&#x27;s shift of political stances and attitudes during and especially after the 2008 presidential campaign, including his self-repudiation of the maverick label, left many writers expressing sadness and wondering what had happened to the McCain they thought they had known. By 2013, some aspects of the older McCain had returned, and his image became that of a kaleidoscope of contradictory tendencies, including as a Republican in Name Only or a &quot;traitor&quot; to his party and, as one writer listed, &quot;the maverick, the former maverick, the curmudgeon, the bridge builder, the war hero bent on transcending the call of self-interest to serve a cause greater than himself, the sore loser, old bull, last lion, loose cannon, happy warrior, elder statesman, lion in winter.&quot;

In his own estimation, McCain was straightforward and direct, but impatient. His other traits included a penchant for lucky charms, and a sense of humor that sometimes backfired spectacularly, as when he made a joke in 1998 about the Clintons that was widely deemed not fit to print in newspapers: &quot;Do you know why Chelsea Clinton is so ugly? – Because Janet Reno is her father.&quot; McCain subsequently apologized profusely, and the Clinton White House accepted his apology. McCain did not shy away from addressing his shortcomings, and he apologized for them. He was known for sometimes being prickly and hot-tempered with Senate colleagues, but his relations with his own Senate staff were more cordial, and inspired loyalty towards him. He formed a strong bond with two senators, Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham, over hawkish foreign policy and overseas travel, and they became dubbed the &quot;Three Amigos&quot;.

McCain acknowledged having said intemperate things in years past, though he also said that many stories have been exaggerated. One psychoanalytic comparison suggested that McCain was not the first presidential candidate to have a temper, and cultural critic Julia Keller argued that voters want leaders who are passionate, engaged, fiery, and feisty. McCain employed both profanity and shouting on occasion, although such incidents became less frequent over the years. Lieberman made this observation: &quot;It is not the kind of anger that is a loss of control. He is a very controlled person.&quot; Senator Thad Cochran, who knew McCain for decades and had battled him over earmarks, expressed concern about a McCain presidency: &quot;He is erratic. He is hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me.&quot; Yet Cochran supported McCain for president when it was clear he would win the nomination. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; editorial board called McCain a patriot, who although sometimes wrong was fearless, and that he deserves to be thought of among the few US senators in history, whose names are more recognizable than some presidents.

All McCain&#x27;s family members were on good terms with him, and he defended them against some of the negative consequences of his high-profile political lifestyle. His family&#x27;s military tradition extends to the latest generation: son John Sidney IV (&quot;Jack&quot;) graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 2009, becoming the fourth generation John S. McCain to do so, and is a helicopter pilot; son James served two tours with the Marines in the Iraq War; and son Doug flew jets in the navy. His daughter Meghan became a blogging and Twittering presence in the debate about the future of the Republican Party following the 2008 elections, and showed some of his maverick tendencies. In 2017 Meghan joined the cast of the popular ABC talk show &quot;The View&quot; as a co-host. Senator McCain himself also appeared as a guest on the program.

McCain appeared in several television shows and films while he was a sitting senator. He made uncredited cameo appearances in &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; and &quot;24&quot; and had two uncredited cameos in &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;. McCain also hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 2002 and appeared in two episodes in 2008.

== Awards and honors ==

In addition to his military honors and decorations, McCain was granted a number of civilian awards and honors.

In 1997, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named McCain as one of the &quot;25 Most Influential People in America&quot;.
In 1999, McCain shared the Profile in Courage Award with Senator Russ Feingold for their work towards campaign finance reform. The following year, the same pair shared the Paul H. Douglas Award for Ethics in Government. In 2005, The Eisenhower Institute awarded McCain the Eisenhower Leadership Prize. The prize recognizes individuals whose lifetime accomplishments reflect Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s legacy of integrity and leadership. In 2006, the Bruce F. Vento Public Service Award was bestowed upon McCain by the National Park Trust. The same year, McCain was awarded the Henry M. Jackson Distinguished Service Award by the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, in honor of Senator Henry M. &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson. In 2007, the World Leadership Forum presented McCain with the Policymaker of the Year Award; it is given internationally to someone who has &quot;created, inspired or strongly influenced important policy or legislation&quot;. In 2010, President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia awarded McCain the Order of National Hero, an award never previously given to a non-Georgian. In 2015, the Kyiv Patriarchate awarded McCain its own version of the Order of St. Vladimir. In 2016, Allegheny College awarded McCain, along with Vice President Joe Biden, its Prize for Civility in Public Life. In August 2016, Petro Poroshenko, the President of Ukraine, awarded McCain with the highest award for foreigners, the Order of Liberty. In 2017, Hashim Thaçi, the President of Kosovo, awarded McCain the &quot;Urdhër i Lirisë&quot; (Order of Freedom) medal for his contribution to the freedom and independence of Kosovo, and its partnership with the U.S. McCain also received the Liberty Medal from the National Constitution Center in 2017. In the spring of 2018 McCain was decorated with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun from the Japanese Emperor for &#x27;strengthening bilateral relations and promoting friendship between Japan and the United States&#x27;. In 2022, President Biden posthumously awarded McCain the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

McCain received several honorary degrees, including from Colgate University (LL.D; 2000), The Citadel (DPA; 2002), Wake Forest University (LL.D; May 20, 2002), the University of Southern California (DHL; May 2004), Northwestern University (LL.D; June 17, 2005), Liberty University (2006), The New School (2006), and the Royal Military College of Canada (D.MSc June 27, 2013). He was also made an Honorary Patron of the University Philosophical Society at Trinity College Dublin in 2005.

On July 11, 2018, , originally named in honor of the Senator&#x27;s father and grandfather, was rededicated in the Senator&#x27;s name also.

On November 29, 2017, the Phoenix City Council unanimously voted to name Terminal 3 at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in Honor of the Senator which opened on January 7, 2019, after his death in August 2018.

== Commemoration ==
On April 4, 2019, the Kyiv City Council renamed a street that had previously been named after the NKVD agent Ivan Kudria to &quot;John McCain Street&quot;.

There is also John McCain Street in the city of Kryvyi Rih. The cities of Vinnytsia and Sumy have Senator McCain Street.

A John McCain memorial was built in Hanoi, now a symbol of McCain&#x27;s relationship with Vietnam, and the relationship of the U.S. to Vietnam.

<text>The prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is a game theory thought experiment involving two rational agents, each of whom can either cooperate for mutual benefit or betray their partner (&quot;defect&quot;) for individual gain. The dilemma arises from the fact that while defecting is rational for each agent, cooperation yields a higher payoff for each. The puzzle was designed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher in 1950 during their work at the RAND Corporation. They invited economist Armen Alchian and mathematician John Williams to play a hundred rounds of the game, observing that Alchian and Williams often chose to cooperate. When asked about the results, John Nash remarked that rational behavior in the iterated version of the game can differ from that in a single-round version. This insight anticipated a key result in game theory: cooperation can emerge in repeated interactions, even in situations where it is not rational in a one-off interaction. 

Albert W. Tucker later named the game the &quot;prisoner&#x27;s dilemma&quot; by framing the rewards in terms of prison sentences. The prisoner&#x27;s dilemma models many real-world situations involving strategic behavior. In casual usage, the label &quot;prisoner&#x27;s dilemma&quot; is applied to any situation in which two entities can gain important benefits by cooperating or suffer by failing to do so, but find it difficult or expensive to coordinate their choices.

== Premise ==

William Poundstone described this &quot;typical contemporary version&quot; of the game in his 1993 book &quot;Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;:

Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of speaking to or exchanging messages with the other. The police admit they don&#x27;t have enough evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge. They plan to sentence both to a year in prison on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the police offer each prisoner a Faustian bargain. If he testifies against his partner, he will go free while the partner will get three years in prison on the main charge. Oh, yes, there is a catch ... If &quot;both&quot; prisoners testify against each other, both will be sentenced to two years in jail. The prisoners are given a little time to think this over, but in no case may either learn what the other has decided until he has irrevocably made his decision. Each is informed that the other prisoner is being offered the very same deal. Each prisoner is concerned only with his own welfare—with minimizing his own prison sentence.

This leads to three different possible outcomes for prisoners A and B:
# If A and B both remain silent, they will each serve one year in prison.
# If one testifies against the other but the other doesn’t, the one testifying will be set free while the other serves three years in prison.
# If A and B testify against each other, they will each serve two years.

==Strategy for the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma==

Two prisoners are separated into individual rooms and cannot communicate with each other. It is assumed that both prisoners understand the nature of the game, have no loyalty to each other, and will have no opportunity for retribution or reward outside of the game. The normal game is shown below:

Regardless of what the other decides, each prisoner gets a higher reward by betraying the other (&quot;defecting&quot;). The reasoning involves analyzing both players&#x27; best responses: B will either cooperate or defect. If B cooperates, A should defect, because going free is better than serving 1 year. If B defects, A should also defect, because serving 2 years is better than serving 3. So, either way, A should defect since defecting is A&#x27;s best response regardless of B&#x27;s strategy. Parallel reasoning will show that B should defect.
Defection always results in a better payoff than cooperation, so it is a strictly dominant strategy for both players. Mutual defection is the only strong Nash equilibrium in the game. Since the collectively ideal result of mutual cooperation is irrational from a self-interested standpoint, this Nash equilibrium is not Pareto efficient.

==Generalized form==
The structure of the traditional prisoner&#x27;s dilemma can be generalized from its original prisoner setting. Suppose that the two players are represented by the colors red and blue and that each player chooses to either &quot;cooperate&quot; or &quot;defect&quot;.

If both players cooperate, they both receive the reward formula_1 for cooperating. If both players defect, they both receive the punishment payoff formula_2. If Blue defects while Red cooperates, then Blue receives the temptation payoff formula_3, while Red receives the &quot;sucker&#x27;s&quot; payoff, formula_4. Similarly, if Blue cooperates while Red defects, then Blue receives the sucker&#x27;s payoff formula_4, while Red receives the temptation payoff formula_3.

This can be expressed in normal form:

and to be a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma game in the strong sense, the following condition must hold for the payoffs:

The payoff relationship implies that mutual cooperation is superior to mutual defection, while the payoff relationships and imply that defection is the dominant strategy for both agents.

==The iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma==

If two players play the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma more than once in succession, remember their opponent&#x27;s previous actions, and are allowed to change their strategy accordingly, the game is called the iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma.

In addition to the general form above, the iterative version also requires that , to prevent alternating cooperation and defection giving a greater reward than mutual cooperation.

The iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is fundamental to some theories of human cooperation and trust. Assuming that the game effectively models transactions between two people that require trust, cooperative behavior in populations can be modeled by a multi-player iterated version of the game. In 1975, Grofman and Pool estimated the count of scholarly articles devoted to it at over 2,000. The iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is also called the &quot;peace-war game&quot;.

=== General strategy ===
If the iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is played a finite number of times and both players know this, then the dominant strategy and Nash equilibrium is to defect in all rounds. The proof is inductive: one might as well defect on the last turn, since the opponent will not have a chance to later retaliate. Therefore, both will defect on the last turn. Thus, the player might as well defect on the second-to-last turn, since the opponent will defect on the last no matter what is done, and so on. The same applies if the game length is unknown but has a known upper limit.

For cooperation to emerge between rational players, the number of rounds must be unknown or infinite. In that case, &quot;always defect&quot; may no longer be a dominant strategy. As shown by Robert Aumann in a 1959 paper, rational players repeatedly interacting for indefinitely long games can sustain cooperation. Specifically, a player may be less willing to cooperate if their counterpart did not cooperate many times, which causes disappointment. Conversely, as time elapses, the likelihood of cooperation tends to rise, owing to the establishment of a &quot;tacit agreement&quot; among participating players. In experimental situations, cooperation can occur even when both participants know how many iterations will be played.

According to a 2019 experimental study in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot; that tested what strategies real-life subjects used in iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma situations with perfect monitoring, the majority of chosen strategies were always to defect, tit-for-tat, and grim trigger. Which strategy the subjects chose depended on the parameters of the game.

===Axelrod&#x27;s tournament and successful strategy conditions===
Interest in the iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma was kindled by Robert Axelrod in his 1984 book &quot;The Evolution of Cooperation&quot;, in which he reports on a tournament that he organized of the &quot;N&quot;-step prisoner&#x27;s dilemma (with &quot;N&quot; fixed) in which participants have to choose their strategy repeatedly and remember their previous encounters. Axelrod invited academic colleagues from around the world to devise computer strategies to compete in an iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma tournament. The programs that were entered varied widely in algorithmic complexity, initial hostility, capacity for forgiveness, and so forth.

Axelrod discovered that when these encounters were repeated over a long period of time with many players, each with different strategies, greedy strategies tended to do very poorly in the long run while more altruistic strategies did better, as judged purely by self-interest. He used this to show a possible mechanism for the evolution of altruistic behavior from mechanisms that are initially purely selfish, by natural selection.

The winning deterministic strategy was tit for tat, developed and entered into the tournament by Anatol Rapoport. It was the simplest of any program entered, containing only four lines of BASIC, and won the contest. The strategy is simply to cooperate on the first iteration of the game; after that, the player does what his or her opponent did on the previous move. Depending on the situation, a slightly better strategy can be &quot;tit for tat with forgiveness&quot;: when the opponent defects, on the next move, the player sometimes cooperates anyway, with a small probability (around 1–5%, depending on the lineup of opponents). This allows for occasional recovery from getting trapped in a cycle of defections.

After analyzing the top-scoring strategies, Axelrod stated several conditions necessary for a strategy to succeed:

* Nice: The strategy will not be the first to defect (this is sometimes referred to as an &quot;optimistic&quot; algorithm), i.e., it will not &quot;cheat&quot; on its opponent for purely self-interested reasons first. Almost all the top-scoring strategies were nice.
* Retaliating: The strategy must sometimes retaliate. An example of a non-retaliating strategy is Always Cooperate, a very bad choice that will frequently be exploited by &quot;nasty&quot; strategies.
* Forgiving: Successful strategies must be forgiving. Though players will retaliate, they will cooperate again if the opponent does not continue to defect. This can stop long runs of revenge and counter-revenge, maximizing points.
* Non-envious: The strategy must not strive to score more than the opponent.

In contrast to the one-time prisoner&#x27;s dilemma game, the optimal strategy in the iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma depends upon the strategies of likely opponents, and how they will react to defections and cooperation. For example, if a population consists entirely of players who always defect, except for one who follows the tit-for-tat strategy, that person is at a slight disadvantage because of the loss on the first turn. In such a population, the optimal strategy is to defect every time. More generally, given a population with a certain percentage of always-defectors with the rest being tit-for-tat players, the optimal strategy depends on the percentage and number of iterations played.

===Other strategies===

Deriving the optimal strategy is generally done in two ways:
* Bayesian Nash equilibrium: If the statistical distribution of opposing strategies can be determined an optimal counter-strategy can be derived analytically.
* Monte Carlo simulations of populations have been made, where individuals with low scores die off, and those with high scores reproduce (a genetic algorithm for finding an optimal strategy). The mix of algorithms in the final population generally depends on the mix in the initial population. The introduction of mutation (random variation during reproduction) lessens the dependency on the initial population; empirical experiments with such systems tend to produce tit-for-tat players, but no analytic proof exists that this will always occur.
In the strategy called win-stay, lose-switch, faced with a failure to cooperate, the player switches strategy the next turn. In certain circumstances, Pavlov beats all other strategies by giving preferential treatment to co-players using a similar strategy.

Although tit-for-tat is considered the most robust basic strategy, a team from Southampton University in England introduced a more successful strategy at the 20th-anniversary iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma competition. It relied on collusion between programs to achieve the highest number of points for a single program. The university submitted 60 programs to the competition, which were designed to recognize each other through a series of five to ten moves at the start. Once this recognition was made, one program would always cooperate and the other would always defect, assuring the maximum number of points for the defector. If the program realized that it was playing a non-Southampton player, it would continuously defect in an attempt to minimize the competing program&#x27;s score. As a result, the 2004 Prisoners&#x27; Dilemma Tournament results show University of Southampton&#x27;s strategies in the first three places (and a number of positions towards the bottom), despite having fewer wins and many more losses than the GRIM strategy. The Southampton strategy takes advantage of the fact that multiple entries were allowed in this particular competition and that a team&#x27;s performance was measured by that of the highest-scoring player (meaning that the use of self-sacrificing players was a form of minmaxing).

Because of this new rule, this competition also has little theoretical significance when analyzing single-agent strategies as compared to Axelrod&#x27;s seminal tournament. But it provided a basis for analyzing how to achieve cooperative strategies in multi-agent frameworks, especially in the presence of noise.

Long before this new-rules tournament was played, Richard Dawkins, in his book &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, pointed out the possibility of such strategies winning if multiple entries were allowed, but remarked that Axelrod would most likely not have allowed them if they had been submitted. It also relies on circumventing the rule that no communication is allowed between players, which the Southampton programs arguably did with their preprogrammed &quot;ten-move dance&quot; to recognize one another, reinforcing how valuable communication can be in shifting the balance of the game.

Even without implicit collusion between software strategies, tit-for-tat is not always the absolute winner of any given tournament; more precisely, its long-run results over a series of tournaments outperform its rivals, but this does not mean it is the most successful in the short term. The same applies to tit-for-tat with forgiveness and other optimal strategies.

This can also be illustrated using the Darwinian ESS simulation. In such a simulation, tit-for-tat will almost always come to dominate, though nasty strategies will drift in and out of the population because a tit-for-tat population is penetrable by non-retaliating nice strategies, which in turn are easy prey for the nasty strategies. Dawkins showed that here, no static mix of strategies forms a stable equilibrium, and the system will always oscillate between bounds.

===Stochastic iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma===

In a stochastic iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma game, strategies are specified in terms of &quot;cooperation probabilities&quot;. In an encounter between player &quot;X&quot; and player &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;X&quot;″s strategy is specified by a set of probabilities &quot;P&quot; of cooperating with &quot;Y&quot;. &quot;P&quot; is a function of the outcomes of their previous encounters or some subset thereof. If &quot;P&quot; is a function of only their most recent &quot;n&quot; encounters, it is called a &quot;memory-n&quot; strategy. A memory-1 strategy is then specified by four cooperation probabilities: formula_7, where &quot;Pcd&quot; is the probability that &quot;X&quot; will cooperate in the present encounter given that the previous encounter was characterized by &quot;X&quot; cooperating and &quot;Y&quot; defecting. If each of the probabilities are either 1 or 0, the strategy is called deterministic. An example of a deterministic strategy is the tit-for-tat strategy written as formula_8, in which &quot;X&quot; responds as &quot;Y&quot; did in the previous encounter. Another is the win-stay, lose switch strategy written as formula_9. It has been shown that for any memory-n strategy there is a corresponding memory-1 strategy that gives the same statistical results, so that only memory-1 strategies need be considered.

If formula_2 is defined as the above 4-element strategy vector of &quot;X&quot; and formula_11 as the 4-element strategy vector of &quot;Y&quot; (where the indices are from &quot;Y&quot;&#x27;s point of view), a transition matrix &quot;M&quot; may be defined for &quot;X&quot; whose &quot;ij&quot;-th entry is the probability that the outcome of a particular encounter between &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; will be &quot;j&quot; given that the previous encounter was &quot;i&quot;, where &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; are one of the four outcome indices: &quot;cc&quot;, &quot;cd&quot;, &quot;dc&quot;, or &quot;dd&quot;. For example, from &quot;X&quot;″s point of view, the probability that the outcome of the present encounter is &quot;cd&quot; given that the previous encounter was &quot;cd&quot; is equal to formula_12. Under these definitions, the iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma qualifies as a stochastic process and &quot;M&quot; is a stochastic matrix, allowing all of the theory of stochastic processes to be applied.

One result of stochastic theory is that there exists a stationary vector &quot;v&quot; for the matrix &quot;v&quot; such that formula_13. Without loss of generality, it may be specified that &quot;v&quot; is normalized so that the sum of its four components is unity. The &quot;ij&quot;-th entry in formula_14 will give the probability that the outcome of an encounter between &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; will be &quot;j&quot; given that the encounter &quot;n&quot; steps previous is &quot;i&quot;. In the limit as &quot;n&quot; approaches infinity, &quot;M&quot; will converge to a matrix with fixed values, giving the long-term probabilities of an encounter producing &quot;j&quot; independent of &quot;i&quot;. In other words, the rows of formula_15 will be identical, giving the long-term equilibrium result probabilities of the iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma without the need to explicitly evaluate a large number of interactions. It can be seen that &quot;v&quot; is a stationary vector for formula_14 and particularly formula_15, so that each row of formula_15 will be equal to &quot;v&quot;. Thus, the stationary vector specifies the equilibrium outcome probabilities for &quot;X&quot;. Defining formula_19 and formula_20 as the short-term payoff vectors for the {&quot;cc,cd,dc,dd&quot;} outcomes (from &quot;X&quot;″s point of view), the equilibrium payoffs for &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; can now be specified as formula_21 and formula_22, allowing the two strategies &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; to be compared for their long-term payoffs.

====Zero-determinant strategies====

In 2012, William H. Press and Freeman Dyson published a new class of strategies for the stochastic iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma called &quot;zero-determinant&quot; (ZD) strategies. The long term payoffs for encounters between &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; can be expressed as the determinant of a matrix which is a function of the two strategies and the short term payoff vectors: formula_23 and formula_24, which do not involve the stationary vector &quot;v&quot;. Since the determinant function formula_25 is linear in formula_26, it follows that formula_27 (where formula_28). Any strategies for which formula_29 are by definition a ZD strategy, and the long-term payoffs obey the relation formula_30.

Tit-for-tat is a ZD strategy which is &quot;fair&quot;, in the sense of not gaining advantage over the other player. But the ZD space also contains strategies that, in the case of two players, can allow one player to unilaterally set the other player&#x27;s score or alternatively force an evolutionary player to achieve a payoff some percentage lower than his own. The extorted player could defect, but would thereby hurt himself by getting a lower payoff. Thus, extortion solutions turn the iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma into a sort of ultimatum game. Specifically, &quot;X&quot; is able to choose a strategy for which formula_31, unilaterally setting &quot;sy&quot; to a specific value within a particular range of values, independent of &quot;Y&quot;″s strategy, offering an opportunity for &quot;X&quot; to &quot;extort&quot; player &quot;Y&quot; (and vice versa). But if &quot;X&quot; tries to set &quot;sx&quot; to a particular value, the range of possibilities is much smaller, consisting only of complete cooperation or complete defection.

An extension of the iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is an evolutionary stochastic iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, in which the relative abundance of particular strategies is allowed to change, with more successful strategies relatively increasing. This process may be accomplished by having less successful players imitate the more successful strategies, or by eliminating less successful players from the game, while multiplying the more successful ones. It has been shown that unfair ZD strategies are not evolutionarily stable. The key intuition is that an evolutionarily stable strategy must not only be able to invade another population (which extortionary ZD strategies can do) but must also perform well against other players of the same type (which extortionary ZD players do poorly because they reduce each other&#x27;s surplus).

Theory and simulations confirm that beyond a critical population size, ZD extortion loses out in evolutionary competition against more cooperative strategies, and as a result, the average payoff in the population increases when the population is larger. In addition, there are some cases in which extortioners may even catalyze cooperation by helping to break out of a face-off between uniform defectors and win–stay, lose–switch agents.

While extortionary ZD strategies are not stable in large populations, another ZD class called &quot;generous&quot; strategies is both stable and robust. When the population is not too small, these strategies can supplant any other ZD strategy and even perform well against a broad array of generic strategies for iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, including win–stay, lose–switch. This was proven specifically for the donation game by Alexander Stewart and Joshua Plotkin in 2013. Generous strategies will cooperate with other cooperative players, and in the face of defection, the generous player loses more utility than its rival. Generous strategies are the intersection of ZD strategies and so-called &quot;good&quot; strategies, which were defined by Ethan Akin to be those for which the player responds to past mutual cooperation with future cooperation and splits expected payoffs equally if he receives at least the cooperative expected payoff. Among good strategies, the generous (ZD) subset performs well when the population is not too small. If the population is very small, defection strategies tend to dominate.

===Continuous iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma===
Most work on the iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma has focused on the discrete case, in which players either cooperate or defect, because this model is relatively simple to analyze. However, some researchers have looked at models of the continuous iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, in which players are able to make a variable contribution to the other player. Le and Boyd found that in such situations, cooperation is much harder to evolve than in the discrete iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. In a continuous prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, if a population starts off in a non-cooperative equilibrium, players who are only marginally more cooperative than non-cooperators get little benefit from assorting with one another. By contrast, in a discrete prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, tit-for-tat cooperators get a big payoff boost from assorting with one another in a non-cooperative equilibrium, relative to non-cooperators. Since nature arguably offers more opportunities for variable cooperation rather than a strict dichotomy of cooperation or defection, the continuous prisoner&#x27;s dilemma may help explain why real-life examples of tit-for-tat-like cooperation are extremely rare even though tit-for-tat seems robust in theoretical models.

==Real-life examples==
Many instances of human interaction and natural processes have payoff matrices like the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma&#x27;s. It is therefore of interest to the social sciences, such as economics, politics, and sociology, as well as to the biological sciences, such as ethology and evolutionary biology. Many natural processes have been abstracted into models in which living beings are engaged in endless games of prisoner&#x27;s dilemma.

===Environmental studies===
In environmental studies, the dilemma is evident in crises such as global climate change. It is argued all countries will benefit from a stable climate, but any single country is often hesitant to curb  emissions. The immediate benefit to any one country from maintaining current behavior is perceived to be greater than the purported eventual benefit to that country if all countries&#x27; behavior was changed, therefore explaining the impasse concerning climate-change in 2007.

An important difference between climate-change politics and the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is uncertainty; the extent and pace at which pollution can change climate is not known. The dilemma faced by governments is therefore different from the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma in that the payoffs of cooperation are unknown. This difference suggests that states will cooperate much less than in a real iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, so that the probability of avoiding a possible climate catastrophe is much smaller than that suggested by a game-theoretical analysis of the situation using a real iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma.

Thomas Osang and Arundhati Nandy provide a theoretical explanation with proofs for a regulation-driven win-win situation along the lines of Michael Porter&#x27;s hypothesis, in which government regulation of competing firms is substantial.

===Animals===
Cooperative behavior of many animals can be understood as an example of the iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. Often animals engage in long-term partnerships; for example, guppies inspect predators cooperatively in groups, and they are thought to punish non-cooperative inspectors.

Vampire bats are social animals that engage in reciprocal food exchange. Applying the payoffs from the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma can help explain this behavior.

===Psychology===
In addiction research and behavioral economics, George Ainslie points out that addiction can be cast as an intertemporal prisoner&#x27;s dilemma problem between the present and future selves of the addict. In this case, &quot;defecting&quot; means relapsing, where not relapsing both today and in the future is by far the best outcome. The case where one abstains today but relapses in the future is the worst outcome: in some sense, the discipline and self-sacrifice involved in abstaining today have been &quot;wasted&quot; because the future relapse means that the addict is right back where they started and will have to start over. Relapsing today and tomorrow is a slightly &quot;better&quot; outcome, because while the addict is still addicted, they haven&#x27;t put the effort in to trying to stop. The final case, where one engages in the addictive behavior today while abstaining tomorrow, has the problem that (as in other prisoner&#x27;s dilemmas) there is an obvious benefit to defecting &quot;today&quot;, but tomorrow one will face the same prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, and the same obvious benefit will be present then, ultimately leading to an endless string of defections.

In &quot;The Science of Trust&quot;, John Gottman defines good relationships as those where partners know not to enter into mutual defection behavior, or at least not to get dynamically stuck there in a loop. In cognitive neuroscience, fast brain signaling associated with processing different rounds may indicate choices at the next round. Mutual cooperation outcomes entail brain activity changes predictive of how quickly a person will cooperate in kind at the next opportunity; this activity may be linked to basic homeostatic and motivational processes, possibly increasing the likelihood of short-cutting into mutual cooperation.

===Economics===
The prisoner&#x27;s dilemma has been called the &quot;E. coli&quot; of social psychology, and it has been used widely to research various topics such as oligopolistic competition and collective action to produce a collective good.

Advertising is sometimes cited as a real example of the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. When cigarette advertising was legal in the United States, competing cigarette manufacturers had to decide how much money to spend on advertising. The effectiveness of Firm A&#x27;s advertising was partially determined by the advertising conducted by Firm B. Likewise, the profit derived from advertising for Firm B is affected by the advertising conducted by Firm A. If both Firm A and Firm B chose to advertise during a given period, then the advertisement from each firm negates the other&#x27;s, receipts remain constant, and expenses increase due to the cost of advertising. Both firms would benefit from a reduction in advertising. However, should Firm B choose not to advertise, Firm A could benefit greatly by advertising. Nevertheless, the optimal amount of advertising by one firm depends on how much advertising the other undertakes. As the best strategy is dependent on what the other firm chooses there is no dominant strategy, which makes it slightly different from a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. The outcome is similar, though, in that both firms would be better off were they to advertise less than in the equilibrium.

Sometimes cooperative behaviors do emerge in business situations. For instance, cigarette manufacturers endorsed the making of laws banning cigarette advertising, understanding that this would reduce costs and increase profits across the industry.

Without enforceable agreements, members of a cartel are also involved in a (multi-player) prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. &quot;Cooperating&quot; typically means agreeing to a price floor, while &quot;defecting&quot; means selling under this minimum level, instantly taking business from other cartel members. Anti-trust authorities want potential cartel members to mutually defect, ensuring the lowest possible prices for consumers.

===Sport===
Doping in sport has been cited as an example of a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. Two competing athletes have the option to use an illegal and/or dangerous drug to boost their performance. If neither athlete takes the drug, then neither gains an advantage. If only one does, then that athlete gains a significant advantage over the competitor, reduced by the legal and/or medical dangers of having taken the drug. But if both athletes take the drug, the benefits cancel out and only the dangers remain, putting them both in a worse position than if neither had doped.

===International politics===
In international relations theory, the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is often used to demonstrate why cooperation fails in situations when cooperation between states is collectively optimal but individually suboptimal. A classic example is the security dilemma, whereby an increase in one state&#x27;s security (such as increasing its military strength) leads other states to fear for their own security out of fear of offensive action. Consequently, security-increasing measures can lead to tensions, escalation or conflict with one or more other parties, producing an outcome which no party truly desires. The security dilemma is particularly intense in situations when it is hard to distinguish offensive weapons from defensive weapons, and offense has the advantage in any conflict over defense.

The prisoner&#x27;s dilemma has frequently been used by realist international relations theorists to demonstrate the why all states (regardless of their internal policies or professed ideology) under international anarchy will struggle to cooperate with one another even when all benefit from such cooperation.

Critics of realism argue that iteration and extending the shadow of the future are solutions to the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. When actors play the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma once, they have incentives to defect, but when they expect to play it repeatedly, they have greater incentives to cooperate.

===Multiplayer dilemmas===
Many real-life dilemmas involve multiple players. Although metaphorical, Garrett Hardin&#x27;s tragedy of the commons may be viewed as an example of a multi-player generalization of the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma: each villager makes a choice for personal gain or restraint. The collective reward for unanimous or frequent defection is very low payoffs and the destruction of the commons.

The commons are not always exploited: William Poundstone, in a book about the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, describes a situation in New Zealand where newspaper boxes are left unlocked. It is possible for people to take a paper without paying (defecting), but very few do, feeling that if they do not pay then neither will others, destroying the system. Subsequent research by Elinor Ostrom, winner of the 2009 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, hypothesized that the tragedy of the commons is oversimplified, with the negative outcome influenced by outside influences. Without complicating pressures, groups communicate and manage the commons among themselves for their mutual benefit, enforcing social norms to preserve the resource and achieve the maximum good for the group, an example of effecting the best-case outcome for prisoner&#x27;s dilemma.

=== Academic settings ===

The prisoner&#x27;s dilemma has been used in various academic settings to illustrate the complexities of cooperation and competition. One notable example is the classroom experiment conducted by sociology professor Dan Chambliss at Hamilton College in the 1980s. Starting in 1981, Chambliss proposed that if no student took the final exam, everyone would receive an A, but if even one student took it, those who didn&#x27;t would receive a zero. In 1988, John Werner, a first-year student, successfully organized his classmates to boycott the exam, demonstrating a practical application of game theory and the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma concept.

Nearly 25 years later, a similar incident occurred at Johns Hopkins University in 2013. Professor Peter Fröhlich&#x27;s grading policy scaled final exams according to the highest score, meaning that if everyone received the same score, they would all get an A. Students in Fröhlich&#x27;s classes organized a boycott of the final exam, ensuring that no one took it. As a result, every student received an A, successfully solving the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma in a mutually optimal way without iteration. These examples highlight how the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma can be used to explore cooperative behavior and strategic decision-making in educational contexts.

==Related games==
===Closed-bag exchange===

Douglas Hofstadter suggested that people often find problems such as the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma problem easier to understand when it is illustrated in the form of a simple game, or trade-off. One of several examples he used was &quot;closed bag exchange&quot;:
===&quot;Friend or Foe?&quot;===
&quot;Friend or Foe?&quot; is a game show that aired from 2002 to 2003 on the Game Show Network in the US. On the game show, three pairs of people compete. When a pair is eliminated, they play a game similar to the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma to determine how the winnings are split. If they both cooperate (Friend), they share the winnings 50–50. If one cooperates and the other defects (Foe), the defector gets all the winnings, and the cooperator gets nothing. If both defect, both leave with nothing. Notice that the reward matrix is slightly different from the standard one given above, as the rewards for the &quot;both defect&quot; and the &quot;cooperate while the opponent defects&quot; cases are identical. This makes the &quot;both defect&quot; case a weak equilibrium, compared with being a strict equilibrium in the standard prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. If a contestant knows that their opponent is going to vote &quot;Foe&quot;, then their own choice does not affect their own winnings. In a specific sense, &quot;Friend or Foe&quot; has a rewards model between prisoner&#x27;s dilemma and the game of Chicken.

This is the rewards matrix:
This payoff matrix has also been used on the British television programs &quot;Trust Me&quot;, &quot;Shafted&quot;, &quot;The Bank Job&quot; and &quot;Golden Balls&quot;, and on the American game show &quot;Take It All&quot;, as well as for the winning couple on the reality shows &quot;Bachelor Pad&quot; and &quot;Love Island&quot;. Game data from the &quot;Golden Balls&quot; series has been analyzed by a team of economists, who found that cooperation was &quot;surprisingly high&quot; for amounts of money that would seem consequential in the real world but were comparatively low in the context of the game.

===Iterated snowdrift===
Researchers from the University of Lausanne and the University of Edinburgh have suggested that the &quot;Iterated Snowdrift Game&quot; may more closely reflect real-world social situations, although this model is actually a chicken game. In this model, the risk of being exploited through defection is lower, and individuals always gain from taking the cooperative choice. The snowdrift game imagines two drivers who are stuck on opposite sides of a snowdrift, each of whom is given the option of shoveling snow to clear a path or remaining in their car. A player&#x27;s highest payoff comes from leaving the opponent to clear all the snow by themselves, but the opponent is still nominally rewarded for their work.

This may better reflect real-world scenarios, the researchers giving the example of two scientists collaborating on a report, both of whom would benefit if the other worked harder. &quot;But when your collaborator doesn&#x27;t do any work, it&#x27;s probably better for you to do all the work yourself. You&#x27;ll still end up with a completed project.&quot;

===Coordination games===
In coordination games, players must coordinate their strategies for a good outcome. An example is two cars that abruptly meet in a blizzard; each must choose whether to swerve left or right. If both swerve left, or both right, the cars do not collide. The local left- and right-hand traffic convention helps to co-ordinate their actions.

Symmetrical co-ordination games include Stag hunt and Bach or Stravinsky.

===Asymmetric prisoner&#x27;s dilemmas===
A more general set of games is asymmetric. As in the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, the best outcome is cooperation, and there are motives for defection. Unlike the symmetric prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, though, one player has more to lose and/or more to gain than the other. Some such games have been described as a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma in which one prisoner has an alibi, hence the term &quot;alibi game&quot;.

In experiments, players getting unequal payoffs in repeated games may seek to maximize profits, but only under the condition that both players receive equal payoffs; this may lead to a stable equilibrium strategy in which the disadvantaged player defects every X game, while the other always co-operates. Such behavior may depend on the experiment&#x27;s social norms around fairness.

==Software==

Several software packages have been created to run simulations and tournaments of the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, some of which have their source code available:
* The source code for the second tournament run by Robert Axelrod (written by Axelrod and many contributors in Fortran)
* Prison, a library written in Java, last updated in 1998
* Axelrod-Python, written in Python
* Evoplex, a fast agent-based modeling program released in 2018 by Marcos Cardinot

==In fiction==
Hannu Rajaniemi set the opening scene of his &quot;The Quantum Thief&quot; trilogy in a &quot;dilemma prison&quot;. The main theme of the series has been described as the &quot;inadequacy of a binary universe&quot; and the ultimate antagonist is a character called the All-Defector. The first book in the series was published in 2010, with the two sequels, &quot;The Fractal Prince&quot; and &quot;The Causal Angel&quot;, published in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

A game modeled after the iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is a central focus of the 2012 video game &quot;Zero Escape: Virtue&#x27;s Last Reward&quot; and a minor part in its 2016 sequel &quot;Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma&quot;.

In &quot;The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; by Trenton Lee Stewart, the main characters start by playing a version of the game and escaping from the &quot;prison&quot; altogether. Later, they become actual prisoners and escape once again.

In &quot;The Adventure Zone: Balance&quot; during &quot;The Suffering Game&quot; subarc, the player characters are twice presented with the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma during their time in two liches&#x27; domain, once cooperating and once defecting.

In the eighth novel from the author James S. A. Corey, &quot;Tiamat&#x27;s Wrath&quot;, Winston Duarte explains the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma to his 14-year-old daughter, Teresa, to train her in strategic thinking.

The 2008 film &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; includes a scene loosely based on the problem in which the Joker rigs two ferries, one containing prisoners and the other containing civilians, arming both groups with the means to detonate the bomb on each other&#x27;s ferries, threatening to detonate them both if they hesitate.

==In reality TV==
In episode 9 of the second series of the Australian reality TV show &quot;The Traitors&quot;, three &quot;traitors&quot; reached the End Game. They participated in the &quot;Traitor&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;: they were given a choice to Share or Steal the prize pot. If all three traitors chose to share, then each would receive a third of the pot. If one or two traitors chose to steal and one or two chose to share, then those who shared would win nothing and the pot would be divided among those who stole. If all three chose to steal, then no one would win anything.

== In moral philosophy ==
The prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is commonly used as a thinking tool in moral philosophy as an illustration of the potential tension between the benefit of the individual and the benefit of the community.

Both the one-shot and the iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma have applications in moral philosophy. Indeed, many of the moral situations, such as genocide, are not easily repeated more than once. Moreover, in many situations, the previous rounds&#x27; outcomes are unknown to the players, since they are not necessarily the same (e.g. interaction with a panhandler on the street).

The philosopher David Gauthier uses the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma to show how morality and rationality can conflict.

Some game theorists have criticized the use of the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma as a thinking tool in moral philosophy. Kenneth Binmore argued that the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma does not accurately describe the game played by humanity, which he argues is closer to a coordination game. Brian Skyrms shares this perspective.

Steven Kuhn suggests that these views may be reconciled by considering that moral behavior can modify the payoff matrix of a game, transforming it from a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma into other games.

=== Pure and impure prisoner&#x27;s dilemma ===
A prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is considered &quot;impure&quot; if a mixed strategy may give better expected payoffs than a pure strategy. This creates the interesting possibility that the moral action from a utilitarian perspective (i.e., aiming at maximizing the good of an action) may require randomization of one&#x27;s strategy, such as cooperating with 80% chance and defecting with 20% chance.

<doc id="43719" wikidata="Q542" url="?curid=43719" title="Sport of athletics">
<text>Athletics is a group of sporting events that involves competitive running, jumping and throwing. The most common types of athletics competitions are track and field, road running, cross-country running, and racewalking.

The results of racing events are decided by finishing position (or time, where measured), while the jumps and throws are won by the athlete that achieves the highest or furthest measurement from a series of attempts. The simplicity of the competitions, and the lack of a need for expensive equipment, makes athletics one of the most common types of sports in the world. Athletics is mostly an individual sport, with the exception of relay races and competitions which combine athletes&#x27; performances for a team score, such as cross country.

Organized athletics are traced back to the ancient Olympic Games from 776 BC. The rules and format of the modern events in athletics were defined in Western Europe and North America in the 19th and early 20th century, and were then spread to other parts of the world. Most modern top level meetings are held under the auspices of World Athletics, the global governing body for the sport of athletics, or its member continental and national federations.

The athletics meeting forms the backbone of the Summer Olympics and most other major multi-sport events. The foremost international athletics meeting is the World Athletics Championships, which incorporates track and field, marathon running and race walking. Other top level competitions in athletics include the World Athletics Indoor Championships, World Athletics Cross Country Championships and the World Athletics Road Running Championships. Athletes with a physical disability compete at the Summer Paralympics and the World Para Athletics Championships.

The most prestigious global season-long leagues in the sport are the Diamond League for track and field athletes, and the World Marathon Majors in marathon running.

The word athletics is derived from the Ancient Greek (, &quot;combatant in public games&quot;) from (, &quot;prize&quot;) or (, &quot;competition&quot;). Initially, the term described athletic contests in general – i.e. sporting competition based primarily on human physical feats. In the 19th century, the term athletics acquired a more narrow definition in Europe and came to describe sports involving competitive running, walking, jumping and throwing. This definition continues to be prominent in the United Kingdom and the former British Empire. Related words in Germanic and Romance languages also have a similar meaning.

In many parts of North America, athletics is commonly understood as encompassing sports in general, aligning with its historical usage. The term &quot;athletics&quot; is seldom used specifically to denote the sport of athletics in this region. Instead, &quot;track and field&quot; is the preferred term used in the United States and Canada to describe athletics events, which include race-walking and marathon running (although cross-country running is typically categorized as a distinct sport).

==History==

===Ancient===

Athletic contests in running, walking, jumping and throwing are among the oldest of all sports and their roots are prehistoric. Athletics events were depicted in the Ancient Egyptian tombs in Saqqara, with illustrations of running at the Heb Sed festival and high jumping appearing in tombs from as early as of 2250 BC. The Tailteann Games were an ancient Celtic festival in Ireland, founded , and the thirty-day meeting included running and stone-throwing among its sporting events. The original and only event at the first Olympics in 776 BC was a stadium-length running event known as the &quot;stadion&quot;. This later expanded to include throwing and jumping events within the ancient pentathlon. Athletics competitions also took place at other Panhellenic Games, which were founded later around 500 BC.

===Modern era===
The Cotswold Olympic Games, a sports festival which emerged in 17th century England, featured athletics in the form of sledgehammer throwing contests. Annually, from 1796 to 1798, L&#x27;Olympiade de la République was held in revolutionary France, and is an early forerunner to the modern Olympic Games. The premier event of this competition was a running event, but various ancient Greek disciplines were also on display. The 1796 Olympiade marked the introduction of the metric system into the sport.

Athletics competitions were held about 1812 at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and in 1840 in Shrewsbury, Shropshire at the Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt. The Royal Military Academy at Woolwich held an organised competition in 1849, and a regular series of closed meetings open only to undergraduates, was held by Exeter College, Oxford, from 1850. The annual Wenlock Olympian Games, first held in 1850 in Wenlock, England, incorporated athletics events into its sports programme.

The first modern-style indoor athletics meetings were recorded shortly after in the 1860s, including a meet at Ashburnham Hall in London which featured four running events and a triple jump competition.

The Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) was established in England in 1880 as the first national body for the sport of athletics and began holding its own annual athletics competition – the AAA Championships. The United States also began holding an annual national competition – the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships – first held in 1876 by the New York Athletic Club. Athletics became codified and standardized via the English AAA and other general sports organisations in the late 19th century, such as the Amateur Athletic Union (founded in the US in 1888) and the (founded in France in 1889).

An athletics competition was included in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 and it has been as one of the foremost competitions at the quadrennial multi-sport event ever since. Originally for men only, the 1928 Olympics saw the introduction of women&#x27;s events in the athletics programme. Athletics is part of the Paralympic Games since the inaugural Games in 1960. Athletics has a very high-profile during major championships, especially the Olympics, even among casual sports fans, but otherwise is less popular though it maintains a dedicate fan base. Big city marathons such as New York, Boston, Chicago, London and Tokyo are major televised events in their respective cities, and often attract thousands of entrants and tens of thousands of spectators, for whom the event is usually free as it takes place on normal city roads. A small number of half marathons and road mile races, including the Great North Run, attract similar attention.

An international governing body, the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF), was founded in 1912. It enforced amateur sport status on competitions during much of the 20th century. Professional competition continued at a low level, becoming increasingly more common as the century progressed. The International Track Association briefly formed a professional track and field circuit in the United States in the 1970s. Athletes used their increasing status to push for remuneration and the IAAF responded with the IAAF Golden Events series and the establishment an outdoor World Championships in 1983, including track and field, racewalking and a marathon event. In modern times, athletes can receive money for racing, putting an end to the so-called &quot;amateurism&quot; that existed before. The global body updated the name to the International Association of Athletics Federations in 2001, moving away from its amateur origins, before taking on its current name World Athletics in 2019. 

The Comité International Sports des Sourds had been formed by 1922, to govern international deaf sports, including athletics.

The first organized international competitions for athletes with a physical disability (not deaf) began in 1952, when the first international Stoke Mandeville Games were organized for World War II veterans. This only included athletes in a wheelchair. This inspired the first Paralympic Games, held in 1960. Competitions would over time be expanded to include mainly athletes with amputation, cerebral palsy and visual impairment, in addition to wheelchair events.

==Events==

World Athletics, the sport&#x27;s governing body, defines athletics in six disciplines: track and field, road running, race walking, cross country running, mountain running, and trail running. Mountain running was added in 2003 and trail running was added in 2015. 

All forms of athletics are individual sports with the exception of relay races. However, athletes&#x27; performances are often tallied together by country at international championships, and, in the case of cross country and road races, finishing positions or times of the top athletes from a team may be combined to declare a team victor.

Several further forms of competitive running exist outside of the governance of World Athletics. The International Skyrunning Federation (ISF) governs high-altitude mountain running, defined as skyrunning, and is affiliated with the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation rather than World Athletics. Competitive stair climbing events, usually hosted in skyscrapers, has two common names: vertical running (as described by the ISF) and tower running (as described by the Towerrunning World Association). Snowshoe running is a winter sport governed by the World Snowshoe Federation, which is similarly to cross country running but has athletes wearing snowshoes to race over deep snow on an obstacle-free course. The International Association of Ultrarunners organises ultra running as an affiliate of World Athletics, but these long-distance forms of competition fit within World Athletics disciplines, albeit with additional distance.

Athletics, specifically the distance running discipline, also forms a significant portion of a number of other organised sports, most notable the triathlon family of sports and modern pentathlon. In both cases, the rules of the sport broadly mirror those of World Athletics, but the details are set by the international federation of the sports themselves.

===Track and field===


Track and field competitions emerged in the late 19th century and were typically contested between athletes who were representing rival educational institutions, military organisations and sports clubs. Participating athletes may compete in one or more events, according to their specialities. Men and women compete separately. Track and field comes in both indoor and outdoor formats, with most indoor competitions occurring in winter, while outdoor events are mostly held in summer. The sport is defined by the venue in which the competitions are held – the athletics stadium.

A variety of running events are held on the track which fall into three broad distance categories: sprints, middle-distance, and long-distance track events. Relay races feature teams comprising four runners each, who must pass a baton to their teammate after a specified distance with the aim of being the first team to finish. Hurdling events and the steeplechase are a variation upon the flat running theme in that athletes must clear obstacles on the track during the race. The field events come in two types – jumping and throwing competitions. In throwing events, athletes are measured by how far they hurl an implement, with the common events being the shot put, discus, javelin, and hammer throw. There are four common jumping events: the long jump and triple jump are contests measuring the horizontal distance an athlete can jump, while the high jump and pole vault are decided on the height achieved. Combined events, which include the decathlon (typically competed by men) and heptathlon (typically competed by women), are competitions where athletes compete in a number of different track and field events, with each performance going toward a final points tally.

The most prestigious track and field contests occur within athletics championships and athletics programmes at multi-sport events. The Olympic athletics competition and World Championships in Athletics, and the Paralympic athletics competition and World Para Athletics Championships, are the highest and most prestigious levels of competition in track and field. Track and field events have become the most prominent part of major athletics championships and many famous athletes within the sport of athletics come from this discipline. Discrete track and field competitions are found at national championships-level and also at annual, invitational track and field meets. Meetings range from elite competitions – such as those in the IAAF Diamond League series – to basic all comers track meets, inter-sports club meetings and schools events, which form the grassroots of track and field.

===Road running===
Road running competitions are running events (predominantly long distance) which are mainly conducted on courses of paved or tarmac roads, although major events often finish on the track of a main stadium. In addition to being a common recreational sport, the elite level of the sport – particularly marathon races – are one of the most popular aspects of athletics. Road racing events can be of virtually any distance, but the most common and well known are the marathon, half marathon, 10 km and 5 km. The marathon is the only road running event featured at the IAAF World Championships in Athletics and the Summer Olympics, although there is also an annual IAAF World Half Marathon Championships. The marathon is also the only road running event featured at the World Para Athletics Championships and the Summer Paralympics. The World Marathon Majors series includes the six most prestigious marathon competitions at the elite level – the Berlin, Boston, Chicago, London, New York City and Tokyo Marathons.

The sport of road running finds its roots in the activities of footmen: male servants who ran alongside the carriages of aristocrats around the 18th century, and who also ran errands over distances for their masters. Foot racing competitions evolved from wagers between aristocrats, who pitted their footman against that of another aristocrat in order to determine a winner. The sport became professionalised as footmen were hired specifically on their athletic ability and began to devote their lives to training for the gambling events. The amateur sports movement in the late 19th century marginalised competitions based on the professional, gambling model. The 1896 Summer Olympics saw the birth of the modern marathon and the event led to the growth of road running competitions through annual events such as the Boston Marathon (first held in 1897) and the Lake Biwa Marathon and Fukuoka Marathons, which were established in the 1940s. The 1970s running boom in the United States made road running a common pastime and also increased its popularity at the elite level.

Ekiden contests – which originated in Japan and remain very popular there – are a relay race variation on the marathon, being in contrast to the typically individual sport of road running.

===Cross country running===
Cross country running is the most naturalistic of the sports in athletics as competitions take place on open-air courses over surfaces such as grass, woodland trails, and earth. It is both an individual and team sport, as runners are judged on an individual basis and a points scoring method is used for teams. Competitions are typically long distance races of or more which are usually held in autumn and winter. Cross country&#x27;s most successful athletes often compete in long-distance track and road events as well.

The Crick Run in England in 1838 was the first recorded instance of an organised cross country competition. The sport gained popularity in British, then American schools in the 19th century and culminated in the creation of the first International Cross Country Championships in 1903. The annual IAAF World Cross Country Championships was inaugurated in 1973 and this remains the highest level of competition for the sport. A number of continental cross country competitions are held, with championships taking place in Asia, Europe, North America and South America. The sport has retained its status at the scholastic level, particularly in the United Kingdom and United States. At the professional level, the foremost competitions come under the banner of the IAAF Cross Country Permit Meetings.

While cross country competitions are no longer held at the Olympics, having featured in the athletics programme from 1912 to 1924, it has been present as one of the events within the modern pentathlon competition since the 1912 Summer Olympics. One variation on traditional cross country is mountain running, which incorporates significant uphill and downhill sections as an additional challenge to the course. Fell running and Orienteering are other competitive sports similar to cross country, although they feature an element of navigation which is absent from the set courses of cross country.

===Racewalking===
Racewalking is a form of competitive walking that usually takes place on open-air roads, although running tracks are also occasionally used. Racewalking is the only sport in athletics in which judges monitor athletes on their technique. Racewalkers must always have a foot in contact with the ground and their advancing leg must be straightened, not bent at the knee – failure to follow these rules results in disqualification from the race.

Racewalking finds its roots in the sport of pedestrianism which emerged in the late 18th century in England. Spectators would gamble on the outcome of the walking competitions. The sport took on an endurance aspect and competitions were held over long distances or walkers would have to achieve a certain distance within a specified time frame, such as Centurion contests of walking within 24 hours. During this period, racewalking was frequently held on athletics tracks for ease of measurement, and the 1908 Summer Olympics in London saw the introduction of the 3500-metre and 10-mile walks. Racewalking was briefly dropped from the Olympic programme in 1928, but the men&#x27;s 50 kilometres race walk has been held at every Olympic Games but one since 1932. The men&#x27;s 20 kilometres race walk was added to the Olympic athletics schedule in 1956 and the women&#x27;s event was first held in 1992. The most common events in modern competition are over 10 km, 20 km and 50 km on roads, although women&#x27;s 3 km and men&#x27;s 5 km are held on indoor tracks.

The highest level racewalking competitions occur at the IAAF World Championships in Athletics and at the Summer Olympics, although the sport also has its own separate major competition – the IAAF World Race Walking Cup – which has been held since 1961. The IAAF World Race Walking Challenge forms the primary seasonal competition – athletes earn points for their performances at ten selected racewalking competitions and the highest scoring walkers are entered into that year&#x27;s IAAF Race Walking Challenge Final.

== Categories ==
The significant variation in people&#x27;s abilities in the sport of athletics has led to the creation of numerous competitive categories, in order that athletes are pitted against rivals of a similar kind or ability, and to include groups of people who would otherwise not be competitive in open-to-all events. The eligibility of athletes for a given category is occasionally a source of controversy among the sport&#x27;s participants, officials and spectators, with disputes typically being rooted in deliberate cheating in order to gain a competitive advantage or differing cultural perspectives over the eligibility of a category.

Beyond the primary categories based on physical attributes, some competitions have further eligibility criteria based on nationality, community membership or occupation.

===Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s divisions===
The foremost division of this kind is by sex[ling]: in athletics, men and women almost exclusively compete against people of the same sex. In contrast to the men&#x27;s division, the development of the women&#x27;s division has caused regular dispute in terms of eligibility. Several intersex athletes had success in the women&#x27;s division in the early 20th century, such as Stanisława Walasiewicz and Mary Weston (later Mark), and the IAAF responded by introducing sex verification for all athletes in the women&#x27;s category, beginning with the disqualification of sprinter Foekje Dillema in 1950 after she refused to be tested. Olympic champion Ewa Kłobukowska became the first athlete to publicly fail the test in 1967 and the humiliation she suffered as a result of the announcement led to sex tests becoming a confidential process. Hurdler Maria José Martínez-Patiño failed a test and was disqualified in 1985, but publicly fought the ban in court and was reinstated in 1988. In 1991, the IAAF replaced the sex chromatin test with general medical tests for athletes of all divisions, due to changes in ethical and scientific viewpoints.

The question of eligibility for the women&#x27;s division continued to be a contentious and public issue into the 21st century, with Caster Semenya and Dutee Chand bearing periods of ineligibility and taking the IAAF to the Court of Arbitration for Sport over their bans under the hyperandrogenism rules. An increasing number of trans men and trans women began to compete in the women&#x27;s division in the 2010s, which caused other athletes in the division to raise questions of fairness in competition.

The dispute reached new heights in 2019 with the United Nations Human Rights Council issuing a statement that the IAAF was breaching &quot;international human rights norms and standards&quot; through its practice of allowing some athletes to compete in the women&#x27;s division only once they had lowered their testosterone levels through medical intervention. The IAAF and several prominent women athletes, such as Paula Radcliffe, said this was required in order to prevent a situation where countries deliberately sought out athletes who were intersex, transgender or had a difference in sex development in order to succeed in women&#x27;s sport. Others have argued for the abolition of gender verification testing, with academic Maren Behrensen citing the harm to tested athletes&#x27; social and emotional well-being, the inaccuracy of the medical tests, the difficulty of determining the exact performance advantage provided by a given condition, and the moral risk of &quot;gender-engineering&quot; by setting a biological definition for a female athlete.

===Age===
Age is a significant determiner of ability to compete in athletics, with athletic ability generally increasing through childhood and adolescence, peaking in early adulthood, then gradually declining from around the age of 30 onwards. As a result, numerous age categories have been created to encourage younger and older athletes to engage in competition. At international level, there are three major categories for young athletes: under-23, under-20 (formerly junior), and under-18 (formerly youth). Beyond international rules, different youth categories are in use in the sport, often in the form of two-year or single age groupings. Age categories are more extensive for older athletes and these are commonly organised under the umbrella of masters athletics, which has age groups spanning five years for all athletes aged 35 and above. There is no limit to the number of age groupings, hence Stanisław Kowalski holds a world record for men aged 105 years and over. For competitions where age is not taken into account, this is known as senior or open class athletics; in international rules there remain some restrictions on younger people competing in endurance events for health reasons .

Athletes&#x27; eligibility for a competitive age grouping is typically assessed through official documentation, such as birth records or passports. Instances of age cheating have occurred at all of the IAAF&#x27;s global age category championships. One prominent incident was Olympic medalist Thomas Longosiwa, who provided a falsified passport to compete at the 2006 World Junior Championships in Athletics at age 24. Age falsification for youth categories is mostly limited to less developed parts of the world, such as Africa and South Asia, which have less stringent controls on official documentation and many mature athletes engaging in high school competition due to disruptions to education. The same regions of the world also present issues with age verification in masters age categories, with examples such as Indian distance runners Dharampal Singh Gudha and Fauja Singh (both claiming to be over 100 years old) reaching mainstream attention.

===Athletes with disabilities===
Athletes with physical disabilities have competed at separate international events since 1952. The International Paralympic Committee governs the competitions in athletics, and hosts the Paralympic Games, which have continued since 1960.

Competitors at elite level competitions, are classified by disability, to arrange athletes with a similar disability in the same event. A classified T12 athlete for example, is a track athlete with a visual impairment.
* F = Field athletes
* T = Track athletes
* 11–13 – visual impairment. Compete with a sighted guide.
* 20 – Intellectual disability
* 31–38 – cerebral palsy
* 40–46 – amputation, and others (including athletes with dwarfism)
* 51–58 – Wheelchair

Operating independently of the Paralympic movement, deaf athletes have a long-established tradition of organised athletics, with the first major world competition being included at the 1924 Deaflympics. The primary impediments to the inclusion of deaf athletes in mainstream athletics are sound based elements of the sport, such as the starter&#x27;s pistol. This can be a disadvantage even in Paralympic sport, as shown in by the example of Olivia Breen who failed to hear a false start in a cerebral palsy class race at the 2012 Paralympics.

In wheelchair racing athletes compete in lightweight racing chairs. Most major marathons have wheelchair divisions and the elite racers consistently beat the runners on foot. The speed of wheel chair racers has caused difficulties for race organisers in properly staggering their start times compared to runners. A collision between Josh Cassidy (a wheelchair racer) and Tiki Gelana (a leading female marathoner) at the 2013 London Marathon brought the issue into the spotlight again.

Occasionally, athletes with a disability reach a level at which they can compete against able-bodied athletes. Legally blind Marla Runyan ran in the 2000 and 2004 Olympics and won a gold medal in the 1500 metres at the 1999 Pan American Games. Oscar Pistorius, a double amputee, was a semi-finalist at the 2011 World Championships and won a silver medal as part of South Africa&#x27;s 4 × 400 metres relay team. In masters athletics it is far more common to make an accommodation for athletes with a disability. Blind Ivy Granstrom set numerous Masters world records while being guided around the track.

The disability categories have caused dispute among athletes, with some athletes being accused of exaggerating their level of disability in order to compete in less challenging categories. Athletes with intellectual disabilities were banned from competition in all Paralympic sports in response to verification issues and cheating at the 2000 Summer Paralympics and the intellectual disability athletics programme was only restored twelve years later at the 2012 Summer Paralympics.

==Venues==
Professional athletics almost exclusively takes place in one of three types of venue: stadiums, set courses on grass or woodland, and road-based courses. Such venues ensure that events take place in a relatively standardised manner, as well as improving the safety of athletes and enjoyment for spectators. At a more basic level, many forms of athletics demand very little in terms of venue requirements; almost any open space or area of field can provide a suitable venue for basic running, jumping and throwing competitions.

===Athletics stadium===

A standard outdoor track is in the shape of a stadium, 400 metres in length, and has at least eight lanes 1.22 m in width (small arenas might have six lanes). Older track facilities may have nonstandard track lengths, such as 440 yards (402.3 m; 1/4 mile) (common in the United States). Historically, tracks were covered by a dirt running surface. Modern All-weather running tracks are covered by a synthetic weather-resistant running surface, which typically consists of rubber (either black SBR or colored EPDM granules), bound by polyurethane or latex resins. Older tracks may be cinder-covered. The facilities can be called track and field stadiums or athletics stadiums.

A standard indoor track is designed similarly to an outdoor track, but is only 200 metres in length and has between four and eight lanes, each with width between 0.90 m and 1.10 m. Often, the bends of an indoor track will be banked to compensate for the small turning radius. However, because of space limitations, indoor tracks may have other nonstandard lengths, such as 160-yard (146.3 m) indoor track at Madison Square Garden used for the Millrose Games. Because of space limitations, meetings held at indoor facilities do not hold many of athletics events typically contested outdoors.

===Cross country courses===

There is no standardised form of cross country course and each venue is significantly defined by the environment it contains – some may be relatively flat and featureless, while others may be more challenging with natural obstacles, tight turns, and undulating ground. While a small number of purpose-built courses exist, the vast majority of cross country running courses are created by cordoning a specific area within any open natural land, typically a park, woodland or greenspace near a settlement.

At the elite and professional level, courses must be looped and each lap must be between 1750 m and 2000 m in length. Severe obstacles such as deep ditches, high barriers and thick undergrowth not normally present; the course should be able to be completed whilst remaining on foot throughout. In order to maintain the sport&#x27;s distinction from road running, the usage of unnatural or macadamised surfaces is generally kept to a minimum or avoided entirely.

Because the majority of races take place on areas of grass, soil, mud or earth, weather conditions can significantly affect the difficulty of cross country courses, as snow and rain reduces traction and can create areas of standing water.

===Road courses===

The surface of road races is highly important and the IAAF dictate that the courses must be along man-made roads, bicycle paths or footpaths. Courses set along major roads of cities are typical of road running events, and traffic is usually cordoned off from the area during the competition. While soft ground, such as grass, is generally avoided, races may start and finish on soft ground or within an athletics stadium. Road racing courses come in two primary types: looped and point-to-point. Courses may be measured and designed to cover a standardised distance, such as , or they may simply follow a set route between two landmarks.

Road running courses over 5 km usually offer drinks or refreshment stations for runners at designated points alongside the course and medical professionals are present at the courses of major races due to the health risks involved with long-distance running.

Elite road walks are conducted on closed loop courses (usually loops of 2,000 or 2,500 meters). Refreshment stations are also present over long distance walking competitions, with drinks being available on every lap for races longer than 10 km.

==Organizations==

In 1912, the formation of the international governing body for athletics, the International Amateur Athletics Federation, began. In recognition of the movement of the sport from amateurism towards professionalism that began in the late 1970s, the word &quot;amateur&quot; was dropped from the name, and the organization was rebranded as the International Association of Athletics Federations in 2001. In late 2019, another rebranding began, with World Athletics as the new title of the governing body.

World Athletics has 215 member nations and territories, which are divided into six continental areas (or area associations). The six association areas are for Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, North and Central America and Caribbean and South America. The sports within athletics do not have their own independent governing bodies at either international or continental level; instead, all fall under the athletics authorities.
*   AAA – Asian Athletics Association
*   CAA – Confederation of African Athletics
*   CONSUDATLE – South American Athletics Confederation
*   NACACAA – North America, Central America and Caribbean Athletic Association
*   EAA – European Athletics Association
*   OAA – Oceania Athletics Association

National level athletics organisations are responsible for the regulation of the sport within their respective countries and most major competitions have some form of permit or approval from their national body.
==Competitions==

Athletics competitions can be broadly divided into three types: international championships, national championships, and annual meetings and races. Athletics at international championships, or Games, represent the pinnacle of competition within the sport, and they are contested between athletes representing their country or region. The organisation of these competitions is usually overseen by either a world, continental, or regional athletics governing body. Athletes gain entry into these competitions by earning selection from their national athletics governing body, which is generally done by assessing athletes via their past achievements or performances at a national selection event. National championships are annual competitions endorsed by a national governing body which serve the purpose of deciding the country&#x27;s best athlete in each event. Annual one-day meetings and races form the most basic level of competition and are the most common format of athletics contests. These events are often invitational and are organised by sports organisations, sports promoters, or other institutions.

Competitions typically feature only one of the sports within athletics. However, major outdoor international athletics championships and athletics competitions held as part of multi-sport events usually feature a combination of track and field, road running and racewalking events

===International competitions===
====Multi-sport events====

The modern Summer Olympics was the first event at which a global athletics competition took place. All the four major sports within athletics have featured in the Olympic athletics programme since its inception in 1896, although cross country has since been dropped. The Olympic competition is the most prestigious athletics contest, and many athletics events are among the most watched events at the Summer Olympics. A total of 47 athletics events are held at the Olympics, 24 for men and 23 for women (as of London 2012). The events within the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s programmes are either identical or have a similar equivalent, with the sole exception being that men contest the 50 km race walk.

Following the model of the Olympics, various other multi-sport events arose during the 20th century, which included athletics as a core sport within the programme from the outset. These included the Commonwealth Games, the Central American and Caribbean Games, Universiade, and many others.

The Summer Paralympics include athletes with a physical disability. Track and field, and road events have featured in the Paralympic athletics programme since its inception in 1960. The Paralympic competition is the most prestigious athletics contest where athletes with a physical disability compete. Athletics at the Paralympic Games also include wheelchair racing where athletes compete in lightweight racing chairs. Athletes with a visual impairment compete with a sighted guide. At the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, for the first time at an international athletics event, the guides received medals, such as the pilots in cycling, and the guides at the Paralympic Winter Games have done for a while.

====World championships====
The World Athletics Championships is the primary global athletics championships held by World Athletics. The biennial competition was first held in 1983 and now features an event programme which is identical to the Olympics. Thus, road running, racewalking and track and field are the sports which feature at the competition. Cross country running has its own discrete global championships – the World Athletics Cross Country Championships – which has been held annually since 1973. The World Athletics Indoor Championships is a biennial athletics championships which features solely indoor track and field events. The foremost separate road running event is the annual World Athletics Half Marathon Championships (formerly &quot;IAAF World Half Marathon Championships&quot;). While not having official world championship status, the biennial World Athletics Race Walking Team Championships fulfils a similar role for the sport of racewalking. Outdoor track and field is the only sport in athletics that does not have a its own distinct global championship which is separate from other types of athletics, although the IAAF Continental Cup (a quadrennial competition between continental teams) is composed entirely of outdoor track and field events.

Other world championships include the World Athletics U20 Championships and the 2017 defunct World Youth Championships in Athletics, which are for athletes under-19 and under-17, respectively. World Masters Athletics conducts the World Masters Athletics Championships for athletes in 5-year age divisions over the age of 35. The now defunct IAAF World Road Relay Championships served as the global event for ekiden marathon relay races. 

Elite athletes with a physical disability compete at the World Para Athletics Championships.

====Area/Continental championships====
African, Asian, European, North &amp; Central and Caribbean (NACAC), Oceania and South American Athletics Championships are held regularly in a variety of configurations. For example, the Oceania Area Championships in Athletics are combined with the Oceania U20 Athletics Championships. Most of the main regions hold separate cross-country, road-running and marathon championships.

There is the Pan American Combined Events Cup. Central American and Caribbean Championships are organised by the Central American and Caribbean Athletic Confederation (the CACAC)).
==Culture and media==

Athletics, and its athletes in particular, has been artistically depicted since ancient times – one of the surviving instances include runners and high jumpers in the motifs of Ancient Egyptian tombs dating from 2250 BC. Athletics was much respected in Ancient Greece and the events within the ancient pentathlon provided inspiration for large statues such as the Discobolus and Discophoros, and for motifs on countless vase and pottery works. Aristotle discussed the significance of the pentathlon in his treatise &quot;Rhetoric&quot; and reflected on the athlete aesthetic of the period: &quot;a body capable of enduring all efforts, either of the racecourse or of bodily strength...This is why the athletes in the pentathlon are most beautiful&quot;.

Films about athletics are overwhelmingly focused on running events: the 1962 film &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot; (based on the book of the same name) explores cross country running as a means of escape. &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, perhaps one of the most well-known athletics films, is a fictionalised account of Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams&#x27;s chase for sprint gold medals at the 1924 Olympics. Track and field has been the subject of American films such as &quot;Personal Best&quot; (1981) and &quot;Across the Tracks&quot; (1991). Biopics are found within the genre, including &quot;Prefontaine&quot; (regarding Steve Prefontaine) and &quot;Jim Thorpe – All-American&quot; (1951) featuring Burt Lancaster as Thorpe. Documentaries are also common with examples such as 2007 film &quot;Spirit of the Marathon&quot;, which follows runners&#x27; preparations for the 2005 Chicago Marathon.

Books on the subject are predominantly non-fiction, and tend towards the forms of training manuals and historical accounts of athletics. The story of the four-minute mile has been a particularly popular subject, spawning books such as &quot;The Perfect Mile&quot; and &quot;3:59.4: The Quest to Break the Four Minute Mile&quot;.

Athletics journalism has spawned a number of dedicated periodicals including &quot;Athletics Weekly&quot; and &quot;Race Walking Record&quot;, both of which were first published in England in the early 1940s, and &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; which was first published in the United States in 1948. &quot;Runner&#x27;s World&quot; has been in print since 1966 and the &quot;Track &amp; Field Magazine of Japan&quot; (&quot;Rikujyo Kyogi Magazine&quot;) is another long-running publication.

Athletics events have been selected as a main motif in numerous collectors&#x27; coins. One of the recent samples is the €10 Greek Running commemorative coin, minted in 2003 to commemorate the 2004 Summer Olympics. In the obverse of the coin, a modern athlete figure appears in the foreground, shown in the starting position, while in the background two ancient runners are carved in a manner that gives the appearance of a coin that is &quot;worn&quot; by time. This scene originally appeared on a black-figure vase of the 6th century BC.

<doc id="43720" wikidata="Q184865" url="?curid=43720" title="Hammer throw">
<text>The hammer throw is one of the four throwing events in regular outdoor track and field competitions, along with the discus throw, shot put and javelin.

The hammer used in this sport is not like any of the tools also called by that name. It consists of a metal ball attached by a steel wire to a grip. These three components are each separate and can move independently. Both the size and weight of the ball vary between men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s events. The women&#x27;s hammer weighs for college and professional meets while the men&#x27;s hammer weighs . 

==History==
Tradition traces it to the Tailteann Games in Tara, Ireland, around the year 1830 BC. Some time later the Celtic warrior Culchulainn reputedly took a chariot axle with a wheel still attached, spun it around and hurled it a long way. The wheel was later replaced by a rock with a wooden handle attached. A sledgehammer began to be used for the sport in Scotland and England during the Middle Ages. In current times, the hammer has changed to the more modern 16 lb. ball attached to a wire and a handle, but the Scottish Highland Games still feature the older style of hammer throw with the rock and the solid wood handle.
While the men&#x27;s hammer throw has been part of the Olympics since 1900, the International Association of Athletics Federations did not start ratifying women&#x27;s marks until 1995. Women&#x27;s hammer throw was first included in the Olympics at the 2000 summer games in Sydney, Australia, after having been included in the World Championships a year earlier.

==Competition==

The men&#x27;s hammer weighs and the women&#x27;s weighs , with the wire in either case no more than in length. Like the other throwing events, the competition is decided by who can throw the implement the farthest.

The throwing motion starts with the thrower swinging the hammer back-and-forth about two times to generate momentum. The thrower then makes three, four or (rarely) five full rotations using a complex heel-toe foot movement, spinning the hammer in a circular path and increasing its angular velocity with each rotation. Rather than spinning the hammer horizontally, it is instead spun in a plane that angles up towards the direction in which it will be launched. The thrower releases the hammer as its velocity is upward and toward the target.
Throws are made from a &quot;throwing circle&quot;. The thrower is not allowed to step outside the throwing circle before the hammer has landed and may only enter and exit from the rear of the throwing circle. The hammer must land within a 34.92º &quot;throwing sector&quot; that is centered on the throwing circle. The sector angle was chosen because it provides a sector whose bounds are easy to measure and lay out on a field (10 metres out from the center of the ring, 6 metres across). A violation of the rules results in a foul and the throw not being counted.

 the men&#x27;s hammer world record is held by Yuriy Sedykh, who threw at the 1986 European Athletics Championships in Stuttgart, West Germany on 30 August. The world record for the women&#x27;s hammer is held by Anita Włodarczyk, who threw during the Kamila Skolimowska Memorial on 28 August 2016. Sedykh&#x27;s 1986 world record has been noted for its longevity, and for dating from &quot;a time when track and field was starting to realize the scale of performance-enhancing drug use&quot; (AP). According to Russian doping whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, Sedykh was a heavy user of steroids, which Sedykh denied.

The throwing distance depends on the velocity and height at which the hammer is released, but also on other factors that are not under the athlete&#x27;s control. In particular, Earth&#x27;s rotation affects it via the location&#x27;s latitude (due to the centrifugal force, the hammer will fly a bit further in a location closer to the equator) and to a lesser extent also via the throw&#x27;s azimuth (i.e. its compass direction, due to Coriolis forces). According to a 2023 study, such effects are large enough that the top 20 world-record rankings for both men and women at the time could somewhat change if they were adjusted for latitude and azimuth.

== Safety issues ==
Hammer throwing has been described as involving &quot;inherent danger [...]. Athletes, coaches, and spectators participating in the event are at risk; steel hammers [...] are hurled through the air at great speeds, [travel] far distances, and [are] sometimes difficult to spot in flight.&quot; For example, hammer throws resulted in four deaths in Europe in 2000 alone, and have caused deaths and permanent brain damage injuries in the United States too.

To mitigate such risks, a C-shaped &quot;hammer cage&quot; was introduced, which is built around the throwing circle, preventing the hammer from flying off in unwanted directions. In 2004, the IAAF changed its rules to increase the mandatory height of hammer cages to 10m and reduce their &quot;danger zone&quot; angle to around 53°. The change also moved the cage gates further away from the throwing circle, thus reducing the risk of a misdirected hammer bouncing back on the thrower.

<doc id="43722" wikidata="Q184654" url="?curid=43722" title="Decathlon">
<text>The decathlon is a combined event in athletics consisting of 10 track and field events. The word &quot;decathlon&quot; was formed, in analogy to the word &quot;pentathlon&quot;, from Greek δέκα (&quot;déka&quot;, meaning &quot;ten&quot;) and ἄθλος (&quot;áthlos&quot;, or ἄθλον, &quot;áthlon&quot;, meaning &quot;contest&quot; or &quot;prize&quot;). Events are held over two consecutive days and the winners are determined by the combined performance in all. Performance is judged on a points system in each event, not by the position achieved. The decathlon is contested mainly by male athletes, while female athletes typically compete in the heptathlon.

Traditionally, the title of &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Athlete&quot; has been given to the person who wins the decathlon. This began when Gustav V of Sweden told Jim Thorpe, &quot;Sir, you are the world&#x27;s greatest athlete&quot; after Thorpe won the decathlon at the Stockholm Olympics in 1912.

The event is similar to the pentathlon held at the ancient Greek Olympics, and also similar to a competition called an &quot;all-around&quot;, which was contested at the United States amateur championships in 1884. Another all-around was held at the 1904 Summer Olympics. The modern decathlon first appeared at the 1912 Games.

In modern athletics, the 10 events are: 100 metres, 400 metres, 1500 metres, 110 metre hurdles, long jump, high jump, pole vault, discus throw, javelin throw, and shotput. The current official decathlon world record holder is French athlete Kevin Mayer, who scored a total of 9,126 points at the 2018 Décastar in France.

==Historical background==
The decathlon developed from the ancient pentathlon competitions held at the ancient Greek Olympics. Pentathlons involved five disciplines – long jump, discus throw, javelin throw, sprint and a wrestling match. Introduced in Olympia during 708 BC, this competition was extremely popular for many centuries.

A ten-event competition known as the &quot;all-around&quot; or &quot;all-round&quot; championship, similar to the modern decathlon, was first contested at the United States amateur championships in 1884 and reached a consistent form by 1890. While an all-around event was held at the 1904 Summer Olympics, whether it was an official Olympic event has been disputed.

The modern decathlon first appeared in the Olympic athletics program at the 1912 Games in Stockholm.

== Format ==

=== Men&#x27;s decathlon ===
The vast majority of international and top-level men&#x27;s decathlons are divided into a two-day competition, with the track and field events held in the order below. Traditionally, all decathletes who finish the event, rather than just the winner or medal-winning athletes, do a round of honour together after the competition. The current world record holder is Kevin Mayer from France with 9126 points which he set on September 16, 2018, in Talence, France.
; Day 1
* 100 metres
* Long jump
* Shot put
* High jump
* 400 metres

;Day 2
* 110 metres hurdles
* Discus throw
* Pole vault
* Javelin throw
* 1500 metres
=== Women&#x27;s decathlon ===
At major championships, the women&#x27;s equivalent of the decathlon is the seven-event heptathlon; before 1981 it was the five-event pentathlon. However, in 2001, the IAAF (now World Athletics) approved scoring tables for a women&#x27;s decathlon; the current world record holder is Austra Skujytė of Lithuania, with 8,358. Women&#x27;s disciplines differ from men&#x27;s in the same way as for standalone events: the shot, discus, and javelin weigh less, and the sprint hurdles use lower hurdles over 100 m rather than 110 m. The points tables used are the same as for the heptathlon in the shared events. In some women&#x27;s decathlon competitions, the schedule differs from the men&#x27;s decathlon, with the field events switched between day one and day two. This rule was initially instituted to avoid scheduling conflicts when men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s decathlon competitions take place simultaneously, however by 2024 the rule was revised to allow conducting the women&#x27;s decathlon using the men&#x27;s event order. The inaugural Women&#x27;s Decathlon World Championships used the men&#x27;s ordering of events.

; Women&#x27;s decathlon reversed field event order (optional)
; Day 1
* 100 metres
* Discus throw
* Pole vault
* Javelin throw
* 400 metres

;Day 2
* 100 metres hurdles
* Long jump
* Shot put
* High jump
* 1500 metres
=== One hour ===
The one-hour decathlon is a special type of decathlon in which the athletes have to start the last of ten events (1500 m) within sixty minutes of the start of the first event. The world record holder is Czech decathlete Robert Změlík, who achieved 7,897 points at a meeting in Ostrava, Czechoslovakia, in 1992.

=== Masters athletics ===
In Masters athletics, performance scores are age graded before being applied to the standard scoring table. This way, marks that would be competitive within an age division can get rated, even if those marks would not appear on the scale designed for younger age groups. Additionally, like women, the age divisions use different implement weights and lower hurdles. Based on this system, German Rolf Geese in the M60 division and American Robert Hewitt in the M80 divisions have set their respective world records over 8,000 points. Using the same scale, Nadine O&#x27;Connor scored 10,234 points in the W65 division, the highest decathlon score ever recorded.

== Points system ==
The 2001 IAAF points tables use the following formulae:
* Points = for track events (faster time produces a higher score)
* Points = for field events (greater distance or height produces a higher score)

, , and are parameters that vary by discipline, as shown in the adjacent table, while is the performance by the athlete, measured in seconds (running), metres (throwing), or centimetres (jumping).

The decathlon tables should not be confused with the scoring tables compiled by Bojidar Spiriev, to allow comparison of the relative quality of performances by athletes in different events. On those tables, for example, a decathlon score of 9,006 points equates to 1,265 &quot;comparison points&quot;, the same number as a triple jump of 18 m.

=== Benchmarks ===

Split evenly between the events, the following table shows the benchmark levels needed to earn 1,000, 900, 800, and 700 points in each sport.

=== Calculator ===

== Records ==

The official decathlon world record holder is Kevin Mayer of France, with a score of 9,126 points set during the 2018 Décastar in Talence, France, which was ratified by World Athletics.
The previous record from Ashton Eaton (9,045 points):


=== Decathlon bests ===
The total decathlon score for all world records in the respective events would be 12,636. The total decathlon score for all the best performances achieved during decathlons is 10,669. The &quot;Difference&quot; column shows the difference in points between the decathlon points that the individual current world record would be awarded and the points awarded to the current decathlon record for that event. The relative differences in points are much higher in throwing events than in running and jumping events.

Decathlon bests are only recognized when an athlete completes the ten-event competition with a score of over 7,000 points.

<text>Eddie Blazonczyk, Sr. (July 12, 1941 – May 21, 2012) was an American polka musician and founder of the band The Versatones. He was inducted into the International Polka Hall of Fame in 1970, and was a 1998 National Heritage Fellowship recipient. He has been called &quot;one of the most important figures in the creation of the contemporary Polish-American polka sound.&quot; He released more than 60 albums.

==History==
Eddie Blazonczyk was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Polish immigrant parents of Goral heritage.

Before becoming a polka artist, and founding Chicago-based Bel-Aire Records in 1963, Eddie Blazonczyk recorded under the name Eddy Bell for Mercury Records, Versa Records, and Lucky Four Records, all three labels based in Chicago. During this period Blazonczyk toured with Buddy Holly, Gene Vincent and Brenda Lee. The records he made for these labels were rockabilly sides, and novelty songs. &quot;The Great Great Pumpkin&quot;, released on Lucky Four #1012, is probably the most noteworthy of these recordings. This recording is still occasionally heard around Halloween and is highly sought by record collectors. Lenny LaCour, the owner of Lucky Four Records, encouraged Blazonczyk, at the age of 22, to specialize in polka music, rather than to continue as a rockabilly singer. Blazonczyk has said, &quot;I took his advice, and never regretted it.&quot;

He is credited with inventing the rhythmic polka subgenre known as &quot;Chicago push,&quot; although ironically the name given to the style comes from bands who came after and were inspired by Blazonczyk, notably the Chicago Push. Musicologist Norm Cohen wrote that &quot;in his illustrious career, Blazonczyk and his Versatones were the primary ambassadors of Polish-American polka, touring constantly and playing well over 200 road gigs per year.&quot;

The Versatones played a mix of both traditional and original tunes, with Blazonczyk singing in both Polish and English. The band consisted of a fiddler and concertina player, two trumpeter/clarinetists, a drummer and Blazonczyk himself on vocals and electric bass. Though his focus remained on the polka genre, Blazonczyk was a fan of rock, country, bluegrass and Cajun music and liked to incorporate those styles into his music when he felt it was appropriate.

Blazonczyk retired from performing in 2002. At that time, he turned over responsibility for his band, The Versatones, to his son, Eddie Blazonczyk Jr. The Versatones played their last performance on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 2011.

==Death==
Blazonczyk died of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome on May 21, 2012.

==Awards and honors==
Blazonczyk was nominated for 11 Grammy Awards, and his album &quot;Another Polka Celebration&quot; won the 1986 Grammy for Best Polka Recording. He was a recipient of the 1998 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the highest honor in the folk and traditional arts in the United States.

<text>Frank John Yankovic (July 28, 1915 – October 14, 1998) was an American accordion player and polka musician. Known as &quot;America&#x27;s Polka King&quot;, Yankovic was considered the premier artist to play in the Slovenian style during his long career. He was not related to fellow accordionist &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, although the two collaborated.

==Background==
Yankovic was born in Davis (West Virginia) to Slovene immigrant parents: Andrew Yankovic (&quot;Andrej Jankovič&quot;, 1879–1949) from Kal and Rose T. Yankovic (née &quot;Terezija Mele&quot;, 1886–1968) from Cerknica, who married in 1910. Yankovic was raised in the Collinwood neighborhood on Cleveland&#x27;s East Side. He recorded over 200 songs and sold over 30 million records in his career. In 1986, he was awarded the first-ever Grammy in the Best Polka Recording category. He rarely strayed from Slovenian-style polka, but did record with country guitarist Chet Atkins and pop singer Don Everly. He also recorded a version of the &quot;Too Fat Polka&quot; with comedian Drew Carey.

==History==
Yankovic&#x27;s father, a blacksmith, and his mother, a cook, met in a lumber camp in West Virginia where they both worked. When Yankovic was young, his father moved to Cleveland to escape authorities who learned of his bootlegging, and the rest of the family followed shortly thereafter. While living in Cleveland, he became enthralled by the brass bands that played at Slovenian social functions. His mother took on boarders to help with the family finances, including a man named Max Zelodec who performed Slovenian tunes on a button box. Yankovic acquired an accordion at age 9, and received a few lessons from Zelodec. By the late 1920s, in his early teenage years, he was a working musician, playing for community events. In the 1930s, he formed a business relationship with Joe Trolli and began making radio appearances on stations such as WJAY and WGAR. As his reputation spread, he sought opportunities to make records, but the major labels turned him down. His first records were made for the Yankee and Joliet labels operated by Fred Wolf, and the expenses were paid for by Yankovic himself.

In 1940, he married his first wife June, and they began to raise a family. However, the expenses of family life quickly overcame the incoming money from his music career, so he opened a tavern, calling it the Yankovic Bar. It became a popular hangout for local musicians, and he continued to run it until he sold it in 1948, dedicating himself to the accordion.

Yankovic enlisted in the armed forces in 1943 and cut numerous records while on leave, prior to his departure for Europe. Yankovic was assigned duty in 1943 in the infantry as a flame-thrower operator. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge where a severe case of frostbite nearly required the amputation of his hands and feet. Fortunately, he was able to beat the resulting gangrene before that became necessary, and was awarded a Purple Heart. The doctors urged him to have his fingers amputated, but he refused, as that would have ended his music career. After getting out of the hospital, he and four other musicians were assigned to special services to entertain the troops, including General George Patton and his Third United States Army.

Yankovic hit the national scene when he earned two platinum singles for &quot;Just Because&quot; (1947) and &quot;Blue Skirt Waltz&quot; (1949). Others who recorded the Blue Skirt Waltz were the Tunemixers and Guy Lombardo both in 1949, Lawrence Welk (Myron Floren) in 1958, Jim Ed Brown and the Browns in 1960, Hank Thompson in 1962, and Bobby Vinton in 1976. Yankovic found a Bohemian Waltz called &quot;Cervenou Sukynku,&quot; (written by Vaclav Blaha) or loosely translated, &quot;Red Skirt Waltz.&quot; Yankovic asked Mitchell Parrish (&quot;Stardust&quot;, &quot;Sleighride&quot;) to write new lyrics to the melody. Parrish changed &quot;red&quot; to &quot;blue&quot;. Yankovic sold over 2.5 million records and with the Tunemixers version and Guy Lombardo&#x27;s version, it sold over 4 million records total in 1949. It was the second Cleveland-style song to sell over one million recordings.
Columbia Records initially refused to record &quot;Just Because&quot;, because other versions of the song had been around for years without much success; only allowing it when Yankovic said that he would buy the first 10,000 records. Yankovic obtained the title of America&#x27;s Polka King after beating Louis Bashell, Romy Gosz, Harold Loeffelmacher and the Six Fat Dutchmen, Whoopee John Wilfahrt, and Lawrence Duchow in a battle of the bands in Milwaukee at the Milwaukee Arena on June 9, 1948.

In 1950, he made his Hollywood debut and collaborated with Doris Day as a singer.

In 1970, a house fire destroyed the gold records for &quot;Just Because&quot; and &quot;Blue Skirt Waltz&quot;.

Yankovic also hosted the television series &quot;Polka Time&quot; for Buffalo, New York-based WKBW-TV for 26 weeks in 1962. He commuted from Cleveland to host each episode, which aired live. He also hosted a similar show at WGN-TV Chicago at about the same time.

He won a Grammy Award in 1986 for his album &quot;70 Years of Hits&quot;. He was the first winner in the Polka category. The NARAS (Grammy) organization dropped the category in 2008.

He performed with musical comedian and fellow accordionist &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, although the two are not related. Al, who also performs polka music among many other styles, has jokingly hypothesized that he was given accordion lessons as a child because his parents thought that &quot;there should be at least one more accordion-playing Yankovic in the world.&quot; Al performed accordion and the backing vocal part on &quot;Who Stole the Kishka?&quot; on one of Frankie&#x27;s final records, &quot;Songs of the Polka King, Vol. 1&quot;. A portion of Frankie&#x27;s &quot;The Tick Tock Polka&quot; is included in the song &quot;Polka Face&quot; on Weird Al&#x27;s &quot;Alpocalypse&quot;; it was used as a lead-in for Weird Al&#x27;s take on &quot;Tik Tok&quot; by Ke$ha.

==Death==
Yankovic died on October 14, 1998, in New Port Richey, Florida, from heart failure, at the age of 83. He is buried in Cleveland&#x27;s Calvary Cemetery. Hundreds of friends, family, his loyal fans and fellow musicians attended his memorial service. At his peak, Yankovic traveled extensively and performed 325 shows a year. He sold 30 million records during his lifetime.

==Honors==

Frankie Yankovic visited Cerknica, the hometown of his parents, in 1952 or 1953 and again in 1995. On the second occasion, a special reception was organized in his honor in Rakov Škocjan. He was presented with a commemorative certificate in recognition of his significant contributions to promoting Slovene culture worldwide. Additionally, he received an oil painting by the academic painter Tomaž Perko to remember his time in Cerknica.

In Bob Dolgan&#x27;s 2006 biography of Yankovic, Frankie&#x27;s longtime drummer Dave Wolnik observed that &quot;Yankovic didn&#x27;t have a street named for him in his own hometown&quot;. This launched a campaign by the National Cleveland-Style Polka Hall of Fame and Museum and City Councilman Michael Polensek, and in a ceremony on August 21, 2007, the square at the intersection of Waterloo Rd. and East 152nd St. in Cleveland (), not far from where Yankovic grew up, was named in his honor.

<text>The Whigs were a political party in the Parliaments of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom. Between the 1680s and the 1850s, the Whigs contested power with their rivals, the Tories. The Whigs became the Liberal Party when the faction merged with the Peelites and Radicals in the 1850s. Many Whigs left the Liberal Party in 1886 over the issue of Irish Home Rule to form the Liberal Unionist Party, which merged into the Conservative Party in 1912.

The Whigs began as a political faction that opposed absolute monarchy and Catholic emancipation, supporting constitutional monarchism and parliamentary government, but also Protestant supremacy. They played a central role in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and were the standing enemies of the Roman Catholic Stuart kings and pretenders. The period known as the Whig Supremacy (1714–1760) was enabled by the Hanoverian succession of George I in 1714 and the failure of the Jacobite rising of 1715 by Tory rebels. The Whigs took full control of the government in 1715 and thoroughly purged the Tories from all major positions in government, the army, the Church of England, the legal profession, and local political offices. The first great leader of the Whigs was Robert Walpole, who maintained control of the government from 1721 to 1742, and whose protégé, Henry Pelham, led the government from 1743 to 1754. Great Britain approximated a one-party state under the Whigs until King George III came to the throne in 1760 and allowed Tories back in. But the Whig Party&#x27;s hold on power remained strong for many years thereafter. Thus historians have called the period from roughly 1714 to 1783 the &quot;long period of Whig oligarchy&quot;. During the American Revolution, the Whigs were the party more sympathetic to American independence and the creation of a democracy in the United States.

By 1784, both the Whigs and Tories had become formal political parties, with Charles James Fox becoming the leader of a reorganized Whig Party arrayed against William Pitt the Younger&#x27;s new Tories. The foundation of both parties depended more on the support of wealthy politicians than on popular votes. Although there were elections to the House of Commons, only a few men controlled most of the voters.

Both parties slowly evolved during the 18th century. In the beginning, the Whig Party generally tended to support the aristocratic families, the continued disenfranchisement of Catholics and toleration of nonconformist Protestants (dissenters such as the Presbyterians), while the Tories generally favoured the minor gentry and people who were (relatively speaking) smallholders; they also supported the legitimacy of a strongly established Church of England. (The so-called High Tories preferred high church Anglicanism, or Anglo-Catholicism. Some, particularly adherents of the non-juring schism, openly or covertly supported the exiled House of Stuart&#x27;s claim to the throne—a position known as Jacobitism.) Later, the Whigs came to draw support from the emerging industrial reformists and the mercantile class while the Tories came to draw support from farmers, landowners, royalists and (relatedly) those who favoured imperial military spending.

By the first half of the 19th century, the Whig manifesto had come to encompass the supremacy of parliament, the abolition of slavery, the expansion of the franchise (suffrage) and an acceleration of the move toward complete equal rights for Catholics (a reversal of the party&#x27;s late-17th-century position, which had been militantly anti-Catholic).

== Name ==
The term &quot;Whig&quot; began as a short form of &quot;whiggamore&quot;, a term originally used by people in the north of England to refer to (cattle) drovers from western Scotland who came to Leith to buy corn. The Gaelic-speaking Scottish cattle drivers would call out &quot;Chuig&quot; or &quot;Chuig an bothar&quot;—meaning &quot;away&quot; or &quot;to the road&quot;; this sounded to the English like &quot;Whig&quot;, and they came to use the word &quot;Whig&quot; or &quot;Whiggamore&quot; derisively to refer to these people. During the English Civil Wars, when Charles I reigned, the term &quot;Whig&quot; was picked up and used by the English to refer derisively to a radical faction of the Scottish Covenanters who called themselves the Kirk Party (see the Whiggamore Raid). It was later applied to Scottish Presbyterian rebels who were against the king&#x27;s Episcopalian order in Scotland.

The word &quot;Whig&quot; entered English political discourse during the Exclusion Bill crisis of 1679–1681: there was controversy about whether King Charles II&#x27;s brother, James, Duke of York, should be allowed to succeed to the throne on Charles&#x27;s death, and &quot;Whig&quot; became a term of abuse for members of the Country Party, which sought to remove James from the line of succession on the grounds that he was a Roman Catholic (Samuel Johnson, a fervent Tory, often joked that &quot;the first Whig was the Devil&quot;.).

Eventually, Country Party politicians themselves would start describing their own faction as the &quot;Whigs&quot;.

In &quot;The History of England&quot;, , David Hume wrote:
== Origins ==

===The parliamentarian faction===

The precursor to the Whigs was Denzil Holles&#x27; parliamentarian faction, which was characterised by its opposition to absolute monarchism.

=== Exclusion Crisis ===

Under Lord Shaftesbury&#x27;s leadership, the Whigs (also known as the Country Party) sought to exclude the Duke of York (who later became King James II) from the throne due to his Roman Catholicism, his favouring of monarchical absolutism, and his connections to France. They believed the heir presumptive, if allowed to inherit the throne, would endanger the Protestant religion, liberty and property.

The first Exclusion Bill was supported by a substantial majority on its second reading in May 1679. In response, King Charles prorogued Parliament and then dissolved it, but the subsequent elections in August and September saw the Whigs&#x27; strength increase. This new parliament did not meet for thirteen months, because Charles wanted to give passions a chance to die down. When it met in October 1680, an Exclusion Bill was introduced and passed in the Commons without major resistance, but was rejected in the Lords. Charles dissolved Parliament in January 1681, but the Whigs did not suffer serious losses in the ensuing election. The next Parliament first met in March at Oxford, but Charles dissolved it after only a few days, when he made an appeal to the country against the Whigs and determined to rule without Parliament. In February, Charles had made a deal with the French King Louis XIV, who promised to support him against the Whigs. Without Parliament, the Whigs gradually crumbled, mainly due to government repression following the discovery of the Rye House Plot. The Whig peers, the Earl of Melville, the Earl of Leven, and Lord Shaftesbury, and Charles II&#x27;s illegitimate son the Duke of Monmouth, being implicated, fled to and regrouped in the United Provinces. Algernon Sidney, Sir Thomas Armstrong and William Russell, Lord Russell, were executed for treason. The Earl of Essex committed suicide in the Tower of London over his arrest for treason, whilst Lord Grey of Werke escaped from the Tower.

=== Glorious Revolution ===

After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Queen Mary II and King William III governed with both Whigs and Tories, despite the fact that many of the Tories still supported the deposed Roman Catholic James II. William saw that the Tories were generally friendlier to royal authority than the Whigs and he employed both groups in his government. His early ministry was largely Tory, but gradually the government came to be dominated by the so-called Junto Whigs, a group of younger Whig politicians who led a tightly organised political grouping. The increasing dominance of the Junto led to a split among the Whigs, with the so-called Country Whigs seeing the Junto as betraying their principles for office. The Country Whigs, led by Robert Harley, gradually merged with the Tory opposition in the later 1690s.

== History ==

=== 18th century ===
Although William&#x27;s successor Anne had considerable Tory sympathies and excluded the Junto Whigs from power, after a brief and unsuccessful experiment with an exclusively Tory government she generally continued William&#x27;s policy of balancing the parties, supported by her moderate Tory ministers, the Duke of Marlborough and Lord Godolphin. However, as the War of the Spanish Succession went on and became less and less popular with the Tories, Marlborough and Godolphin were forced to rely more and more on the Junto Whigs, so that by 1708 they headed an administration of the Parliament of Great Britain dominated by the Junto. Anne herself grew increasingly uncomfortable with this dependence on the Whigs, especially as her personal relationship with the Duchess of Marlborough deteriorated. This situation also became increasingly uncomfortable to many of the non-Junto Whigs, led by the Duke of Somerset and the Duke of Shrewsbury, who began to intrigue with Robert Harley&#x27;s Tories. In the spring of 1710, Anne dismissed Godolphin and the Junto ministers, replacing them with Tories.

The Whigs now moved into opposition and particularly decried the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, which they attempted to block through their majority in the House of Lords. The Tory administration led by Harley and the Viscount Bolingbroke persuaded the Queen to create twelve new Tory peers to force the treaty through.

==== Liberal ideals ====

The Whigs primarily advocated the supremacy of Parliament, while calling for toleration for Protestant dissenters. They adamantly opposed a Catholic as king. They opposed the Catholic Church because they saw it as a threat to liberty, or as Pitt the Elder stated: &quot;The errors of Rome are rank idolatry, a subversion of all civil as well as religious liberty, and the utter disgrace of reason and of human nature&quot;.

Ashcraft and Goldsmith (1983) have traced in detail, in the period 1689 to 1710, the major influence of the liberal political ideas of John Locke on Whig political values, as expressed in widely cited manifestos such as &quot;Political Aphorisms: or, the True Maxims of Government Displayed&quot;, an anonymous pamphlet that appeared in 1690 and was widely cited by Whigs. The 18th-century Whigs borrowed the concepts and language of universal rights employed by political theorists Locke and Algernon Sidney (1622–1682). By the 1770s the ideas of Adam Smith, a founder of classical liberalism became important. As Wilson and Reill (2004) note: &quot;Adam Smith&#x27;s theory melded nicely with the liberal political stance of the Whig Party and its middle-class constituents&quot;.

Samuel Johnson (1709–1784), a leading London intellectual, repeatedly denigrated the &quot;vile&quot; Whigs and praised the Tories, even during times of Whig political supremacy. In his great &quot;Dictionary&quot; (1755), Johnson defined a Tory as &quot;one who adheres to the ancient Constitution of the state and the apostolical hierarchy of the Church of England, opposed to a Whig&quot;. He linked 18th-century Whiggism with 17th-century revolutionary Puritanism, arguing that the Whigs of his day were similarly inimical to the established order of church and state. Johnson recommended that strict uniformity in religious externals was the best antidote to the objectionable religious traits that he linked to Whiggism.

==== Protectionism ====
At their inception, the Whigs were protectionist in economic policy, with free trade policies being advocated by Tories. The Whigs were opposed to the pro-French policies of the Stuart kings Charles II and James II as they believed that such an alliance with the Catholic absolute monarchy of France endangered liberty and Protestantism. The Whigs claimed that trade with France was bad for England and developed an economic theory of overbalance, that is a deficit of trade with France was bad because it would enrich France at England&#x27;s expense.

In 1678, the Whigs passed the Prohibition of 1678 that banned certain French goods from being imported into England. The economic historian William Ashley claimed that this Act witnessed the &quot;real starting-point in the history of Whig policy in the matter of trade&quot;. It was repealed upon the accession of James II by a Tory-dominated House of Commons but upon the accession of William III in 1688 a new Act was passed that prohibited the importation of French goods. In 1704, the Whigs passed the Trade with France Act that renewed protectionism against France. In 1710, Queen Anne appointed the predominantly Tory Harley Ministry, which favoured free trade. When the Tory minister Lord Bolingbroke proposed a commercial treaty with France in 1713 that would have led to freer trade, the Whigs were vehemently against it and it had to be abandoned.

In 1786, Pitt&#x27;s government negotiated the Eden Agreement, a commercial treaty with France which led to freer trade between the two countries. All of the Whig leaders attacked this on traditional Whig anti-French and protectionist grounds. Fox claimed that France was England&#x27;s natural enemy and that it was only at Britain&#x27;s expense that she could grow. Edmund Burke, Richard Sheridan, William Windham and Charles Grey all spoke out against the trade agreement on the same grounds.

Ashley claimed that &quot;[t]he traditional policy of the Whig party from before the Revolution [of 1688] down to the time of Fox was an extreme form of Protectionism&quot;. The Whigs&#x27; protectionism of this period is today increasingly cited with approval by heterodox economists such as Ha-Joon Chang, who wish to challenge contemporary prevailing free trade orthodoxies via precedents from the past.

Later on, several members from the Whig party came to oppose the protectionism of the Corn Laws, but trade restrictions were not repealed even after the Whigs returned to power in the 1830s.

==== Whig Supremacy ====

With the succession of Elector George Louis of Hanover as king in 1714, the Whigs returned to government with the support of some Hanoverian Tories. The Jacobite rising of 1715 discredited much of the Tory party as treasonous Jacobites, and the Septennial Act ensured that the Whigs became the dominant party, establishing the Whig oligarchy. Between 1717 and 1720 the Whig Split led to a division in the party. Government Whigs led by the former soldier James Stanhope were opposed by Robert Walpole and his allies. While Stanhope was backed by George I, Walpole and his supporters were closer to the Prince of Wales. Following his success in defeating the government over the Peerage Bill in 1719, Walpole was invited back into government the following year. He was able to defend the government in the Commons when the South Sea Bubble collapsed. When Stanhope died unexpectedly in 1721, Walpole replaced him as leader of the government and became known as the first Prime Minister. In the 1722 general election the Whigs swept to a decisive victory.

Between 1714 and 1760, the Tories struggled as an active political force, but always retained a considerable presence in the House of Commons. The governments of Walpole, Henry Pelham and his older brother the Duke of Newcastle dominated between 1721 and 1757 (with a brief break during the also-Whig Carteret ministry). The leading entities in these governments consistently referred to themselves as &quot;Whigs&quot;.

==== George III&#x27;s accession ====
This arrangement changed during the reign of George III, who hoped to restore his own power by freeing himself from the great Whig magnates. Thus George promoted his old tutor Lord Bute to power and broke with the old Whig leadership surrounding the Duke of Newcastle. After a decade of factional chaos, with distinct Bedfordite, Chathamite, Grenvillite and Rockinghamite factions successively in power and all referring to themselves as &quot;Whigs&quot;, a new system emerged with two separate opposition groups. The Rockingham Whigs claimed the mantle of Old Whigs as the purported successors of the party of the Pelhams and the great Whig families. With such noted intellectuals as Edmund Burke behind them, the Rockingham Whigs laid out a philosophy which for the first time extolled the virtues of faction, or at least their faction. The other group were the followers of Lord Chatham, who as the great political hero of the Seven Years&#x27; War generally took a stance of opposition to party and faction.

The Whigs were opposed by the government of Lord North which they accused of being a Tory administration. While it largely consisted of individuals previously associated with the Whigs, many old Pelhamites as well as the Bedfordite Whig faction formerly led by the Duke of Bedford and elements of that which had been led by George Grenville, it also contained elements of the Kings&#x27; Men, the group formerly associated with Lord Bute and which was generally seen as Tory-leaning.

==== American impact ====
The association of Toryism with Lord North&#x27;s government was also influential in the American colonies and writings of British political commentators known as the Radical Whigs did much to stimulate colonial republican sentiment. Early activists in the colonies called themselves Whigs, seeing themselves as in alliance with the political opposition in Britain, until they turned to independence and started emphasising the label Patriots. In contrast, the American Loyalists, who supported the monarchy, were consistently also referred to as Tories.

Later, the United States Whig Party was founded in 1833 on the basis of opposition to a strong presidency, initially the presidency of Andrew Jackson, analogous to the British Whig opposition to a strong monarchy. The True Whig Party, which for a century dominated Liberia, was named for the American party rather than directly for the British one.

==== Two-party system ====

Dickinson reports the following:
The North administration left power in March 1782 following the American Revolution and a coalition of the Rockingham Whigs and the former Chathamites, now led by the Earl of Shelburne, took its place. After Rockingham&#x27;s unexpected death in July 1782, this uneasy coalition fell apart, with Charles James Fox, Rockingham&#x27;s successor as faction leader, quarrelling with Shelburne and withdrawing his supporters from the government. The following Shelburne administration was short-lived and Fox returned to power in April 1783, this time in an unexpected coalition with his old enemy Lord North. Although this pairing seemed unnatural to many at the time, it was to last beyond the demise of the coalition in December 1783. The coalition&#x27;s untimely fall was brought about by George III in league with the House of Lords and the King now brought in Chatham&#x27;s son William Pitt the Younger as his prime minister.

It was only now that a genuine two-party system can be seen to emerge, with Pitt and the government on the one side, and the ousted Fox-North coalition on the other. On 17 December 1783, Fox stated in the House of Commons that &quot;[i]f [...] a change must take place, and a new ministry is to be formed and supported, not by the confidence of this House or the public, but the sole authority of the Crown, I, for one, shall not envy that hon. gentleman his situation. From that moment I put in my claim for a monopoly of Whig principles&quot;. Although Pitt is often referred to as a Tory and Fox as a Whig, Pitt always considered himself to be an independent Whig and generally opposed the development of a strict partisan political system. Fox&#x27;s supporters saw themselves as legitimate heirs of the Whig tradition and they strongly opposed Pitt in his early years in office, notably during the regency crisis revolving around the King&#x27;s temporary insanity in 1788–1789, when Fox and his allies supported full powers as regent for their ally, the Prince of Wales.

The opposition Whigs were split by the onset of the French Revolution. While Fox and some younger members of the party such as Charles Grey and Richard Brinsley Sheridan were sympathetic to the French revolutionaries, others led by Edmund Burke were strongly opposed. Although Burke himself was largely alone in defecting to Pitt in 1791, much of the rest of the party, including the influential House of Lords leader the Duke of Portland, Rockingham&#x27;s nephew Lord Fitzwilliam and William Windham, were increasingly uncomfortable with the flirtations of Fox and his allies with radicalism and the French Revolution. They split in early 1793 with Fox over the question of support for the war with France and by the end of the year they had openly broken with Fox. By the summer of the next year, large portions of the opposition had defected and joined Pitt&#x27;s government.

=== 19th century ===

Many of the Whigs who had joined with Pitt would eventually return to the fold, joining again with Fox in the Ministry of All the Talents following Pitt&#x27;s death in 1806. The followers of Pitt—led until 1809 by Fox&#x27;s old colleague the Duke of Portland—rejected the label of Tories and preferred to call themselves The Friends of Mr. Pitt. After the fall of the Talents ministry in 1807, the Foxite Whigs remained out of power for the better part of 25 years. The accession of Fox&#x27;s old ally, the Prince of Wales, to the regency in 1811 did not change the situation, as the Prince had broken entirely with his old Foxite Whig companions. The members of the government of Lord Liverpool from 1812 to 1827 called themselves Whigs.

==== Structure and appeal ====
By 1815, the Whigs were still far from being a &quot;party&quot; in the modern sense. They had no definite programme or policy and were by no means even united. Generally, they stood for reducing crown patronage, sympathy towards nonconformists, support for the interests of merchants and bankers and a leaning towards the idea of a limited reform of the voting system. Most Whig leaders, such as Lord Grey, Lord Grenville, Lord Althorp, William Lamb (later Lord Melbourne) and Lord John Russell, were still rich landowners. The most prominent exception was Henry Brougham, the talented lawyer, who had a relatively modest background.

Hay argues that Whig leaders welcomed the increasing political participation of the English middle classes in the two decades after the defeat of Napoleon in 1815. The fresh support strengthened their position in Parliament. Whigs rejected the Tory appeals to governmental authority and social discipline and extended political discussion beyond Parliament. Whigs used a national network of newspapers and magazines as well as local clubs to deliver their message. The press organised petitions and debates and reported to the public on government policy, while leaders such as Henry Brougham (1778–1868) built alliances with men who lacked direct representation. This new approach to the grass roots helped to define Whiggism and opened the way for later success. Whigs thereby forced the government to recognise the role of public opinion in parliamentary debate and influenced views of representation and reform throughout the 19th century.

==== Return to power ====

Whigs restored their unity by supporting moral reforms, especially the abolition of slavery. They triumphed in 1830 as champions of Parliamentary reform. They made Lord Grey prime minister 1830–1834 and the Reform Act 1832 championed by Grey became their signature measure. It broadened the franchise and ended the system of &quot;rotten and pocket boroughs&quot; (where elections were controlled by powerful families) and instead redistributed power on the basis of population. It added 217,000 voters to an electorate of 435,000 in England and Wales. Only the upper and middle classes voted, so this shifted power away from the landed aristocracy to the urban middle classes. In 1832, the party abolished enslavement in the British Empire with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. It purchased and freed the slaves, especially those in the Caribbean sugar islands. After parliamentary investigations demonstrated the horrors of child labour, limited reforms were passed in 1833. The Whigs also passed the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 that reformed the administration of relief to the poor and the Marriage Act 1836 that allowed civil marriages.

It was around this time that the great Whig historian Thomas Babington Macaulay began to promulgate what would later be coined the Whig view of history, in which all of English history was seen as leading up to the culminating moment of the passage of Lord Grey&#x27;s reform bill. This view led to serious distortions in later portrayals of 17th-century and 18th-century history, as Macaulay and his followers attempted to fit the complex and changing factional politics of the Restoration into the neat categories of 19th-century political divisions.

In 1836, a private gentleman&#x27;s Club was constructed in Pall Mall, Piccadilly as a consequence of the successful Reform Act 1832. The Reform Club was founded by Edward Ellice Sr., MP for Coventry and Whig Whip, whose riches came from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company but whose zeal was chiefly devoted to securing the passage of the Reform Act 1832. This new club, for members of both Houses of Parliament, was intended to be a forum for the radical ideas which the First Reform Bill represented: a bastion of liberal and progressive thought that became closely associated with the Liberal Party, who largely succeeded the Whigs in the second half of the 19th century.

Until the decline of the Liberal Party in the early 20th century, it was &quot;de rigueur&quot; for Liberal MPs and peers to be members of the Reform Club, being regarded as an unofficial party headquarters. However, in 1882 the National Liberal Club was established under William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s chairmanship, designed to be more &quot;inclusive&quot; towards Liberal grandees and activists throughout the United Kingdom.

==== Transition to the Liberal Party ====
The Liberal Party (the term was first used officially in 1868, but had been used colloquially for decades beforehand) arose from a coalition of Whigs, free trade Tory followers of Robert Peel and free trade Radicals, first created, tenuously under the Peelite Earl of Aberdeen in 1852 and put together more permanently under the former Canningite Tory Lord Palmerston in 1859. Although the Whigs at first formed the most important part of the coalition, the Whiggish elements of the new party progressively lost influence during the long leadership of former Peelite William Ewart Gladstone. Subsequently, the majority of the old Whig aristocracy broke from the party over the issue of Irish home rule in 1886 to help form the Liberal Unionist Party, which in turn would merge with the Conservative Party by 1912. However, the Unionist support for trade protection in the early twentieth century under Joseph Chamberlain (probably the least Whiggish character in the Liberal Unionist party) further alienated the more orthodox Whigs. By the early twentieth century &quot;Whiggery&quot; was largely irrelevant and without a natural political home. One of the last active politicians to celebrate his Whiggish roots was the Liberal Unionist statesman Henry James.

== In popular culture ==
The colours of the Whig Party (blue and buff, a yellow-brown colour named after buff leather) were particularly associated with Charles James Fox.

Poet Robert Burns in &quot;Here&#x27;s a health to them that&#x27;s awa&quot; wrote:
&quot;The British Whig March&quot; for piano was written by Oscar Telgmann in Kingston, Ontario, .

Punk band The Men That Will Not Be Blamed for Nothing have a song named &quot;Doing It for the Whigs&quot;.

<text>Linear programming (LP), also called linear optimization, is a method to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model whose requirements and objective are represented by linear relationships. Linear programming is a special case of mathematical programming (also known as mathematical optimization).

More formally, linear programming is a technique for the optimization of a linear objective function, subject to linear equality and linear inequality constraints. Its feasible region is a convex polytope, which is a set defined as the intersection of finitely many half spaces, each of which is defined by a linear inequality. Its objective function is a real-valued affine (linear) function defined on this polytope. A linear programming algorithm finds a point in the polytope where this function has the largest (or smallest) value if such a point exists.

Linear programs are problems that can be expressed in standard form as
:formula_1
Here the components of formula_2 are the variables to be determined, formula_3 and formula_4 are given vectors, and formula_5 is a given matrix. The function whose value is to be maximized (formula_6 in this case) is called the objective function. The constraints formula_7 and formula_8 specify a convex polytope over which the objective function is to be optimized.

Linear programming can be applied to various fields of study. It is widely used in mathematics and, to a lesser extent, in business, economics, and some engineering problems. There is a close connection between linear programs, eigenequations, John von Neumann&#x27;s general equilibrium model, and structural equilibrium models (see dual linear program for details).
Industries that use linear programming models include transportation, energy, telecommunications, and manufacturing. It has proven useful in modeling diverse types of problems in planning, routing, scheduling, assignment, and design.

== History ==

The problem of solving a system of linear inequalities dates back at least as far as Fourier, who in 1827 published a method for solving them, and after whom the method of Fourier–Motzkin elimination is named.

In the late 1930s, Soviet mathematician Leonid Kantorovich and American economist Wassily Leontief independently delved into the practical applications of linear programming. Kantorovich focused on manufacturing schedules, while Leontief explored economic applications. Their groundbreaking work was largely overlooked for decades.

The turning point came during World War II when linear programming emerged as a vital tool. It found extensive use in addressing complex wartime challenges, including transportation logistics, scheduling, and resource allocation. Linear programming proved invaluable in optimizing these processes while considering critical constraints such as costs and resource availability.

Despite its initial obscurity, the wartime successes propelled linear programming into the spotlight. Post-WWII, the method gained widespread recognition and became a cornerstone in various fields, from operations research to economics. The overlooked contributions of Kantorovich and Leontief in the late 1930s eventually became foundational to the broader acceptance and utilization of linear programming in optimizing decision-making processes.

Kantorovich&#x27;s work was initially neglected in the USSR. About the same time as Kantorovich, the Dutch-American economist T. C. Koopmans formulated classical economic problems as linear programs. Kantorovich and Koopmans later shared the 1975 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. In 1941, Frank Lauren Hitchcock also formulated transportation problems as linear programs and gave a solution very similar to the later simplex method. Hitchcock had died in 1957, and the Nobel Memorial Prize is not awarded posthumously.

From 1946 to 1947 George B. Dantzig independently developed general linear programming formulation to use for planning problems in the US Air Force. In 1947, Dantzig also invented the simplex method that, for the first time efficiently, tackled the linear programming problem in most cases. When Dantzig arranged a meeting with John von Neumann to discuss his simplex method, von Neumann immediately conjectured the theory of duality by realizing that the problem he had been working in game theory was equivalent. Dantzig provided formal proof in an unpublished report &quot;A Theorem on Linear Inequalities&quot; on January 5, 1948. Dantzig&#x27;s work was made available to public in 1951. In the post-war years, many industries applied it in their daily planning.

Dantzig&#x27;s original example was to find the best assignment of 70 people to 70 jobs. The computing power required to test all the permutations to select the best assignment is vast; the number of possible configurations exceeds the number of particles in the observable universe. However, it takes only a moment to find the optimum solution by posing the problem as a linear program and applying the simplex algorithm. The theory behind linear programming drastically reduces the number of possible solutions that must be checked.

The linear programming problem was first shown to be solvable in polynomial time by Leonid Khachiyan in 1979, but a larger theoretical and practical breakthrough in the field came in 1984 when Narendra Karmarkar introduced a new interior-point method for solving linear-programming problems.

== Uses ==
Linear programming is a widely used field of optimization for several reasons. Many practical problems in operations research can be expressed as linear programming problems. Certain special cases of linear programming, such as &quot;network flow&quot; problems and &quot;multicommodity flow&quot; problems, are considered important enough to have much research on specialized algorithms. A number of algorithms for other types of optimization problems work by solving linear programming problems as sub-problems. Historically, ideas from linear programming have inspired many of the central concepts of optimization theory, such as &quot;duality,&quot; &quot;decomposition,&quot; and the importance of &quot;convexity&quot; and its generalizations. Likewise, linear programming was heavily used in the early formation of microeconomics, and it is currently utilized in company management, such as planning, production, transportation, and technology. Although the modern management issues are ever-changing, most companies would like to maximize profits and minimize costs with limited resources.

&quot;Standard form&quot; is the usual and most intuitive form of describing a linear programming problem. It consists of the following three parts:
* A linear (or affine) function to be maximized
: e.g. formula_9
* Problem constraints of the following form
: e.g.
:: formula_10
* Non-negative variables
: e.g.
:: formula_11

The problem is usually expressed in &quot;matrix form&quot;, and then becomes:
: formula_12

Other forms, such as minimization problems, problems with constraints on alternative forms, and problems involving negative variables can always be rewritten into an equivalent problem in standard form.

=== Example ===

Suppose that a farmer has a piece of farm land, say &quot;L&quot; hectares, to be planted with either wheat or barley or some combination of the two. The farmer has &quot;F&quot; kilograms of fertilizer and &quot;P&quot; kilograms of pesticide. Every hectare of wheat requires &quot;F&quot;1 kilograms of fertilizer and &quot;P&quot;1 kilograms of pesticide, while every hectare of barley requires &quot;F&quot;2 kilograms of fertilizer and &quot;P&quot;2 kilograms of pesticide. Let S1 be the selling price of wheat and S2 be the selling price of barley, per hectare. If we denote the area of land planted with wheat and barley by &quot;x&quot;1 and &quot;x&quot;2 respectively, then profit can be maximized by choosing optimal values for &quot;x&quot;1 and &quot;x&quot;2. This problem can be expressed with the following linear programming problem in the standard form:
In matrix form this becomes:
: maximize formula_13
: subject to formula_14

== Augmented form (slack form) ==
Linear programming problems can be converted into an &quot;augmented form&quot; in order to apply the common form of the simplex algorithm. This form introduces non-negative &quot;slack variables&quot; to replace inequalities with equalities in the constraints. The problems can then be written in the following block matrix form:
: Maximize formula_15:
: formula_16
:formula_17
where formula_18 are the newly introduced slack variables, formula_2 are the decision variables, and formula_15 is the variable to be maximized.

=== Example ===
The example above is converted into the following augmented form:
where formula_21 are (non-negative) slack variables, representing in this example the unused area, the amount of unused fertilizer, and the amount of unused pesticide.

In matrix form this becomes:
: Maximize formula_15:
: formula_23

== Duality ==

Every linear programming problem, referred to as a &quot;primal&quot; problem, can be converted into a dual problem, which provides an upper bound to the optimal value of the primal problem. In matrix form, we can express the &quot;primal&quot; problem as:

: Maximize cTx subject to &quot;A&quot;x ≤ b, x ≥ 0;
:: with the corresponding symmetric dual problem,
: Minimize bTy subject to &quot;A&quot;Ty ≥ c, y ≥ 0.

An alternative primal formulation is:

: Maximize cTx subject to &quot;A&quot;x ≤ b;
:: with the corresponding asymmetric dual problem,
: Minimize bTy subject to &quot;A&quot;Ty = c, y ≥ 0.

There are two ideas fundamental to duality theory. One is the fact that (for the symmetric dual) the dual of a dual linear program is the original primal linear program. Additionally, every feasible solution for a linear program gives a bound on the optimal value of the objective function of its dual. The weak duality theorem states that the objective function value of the dual at any feasible solution is always greater than or equal to the objective function value of the primal at any feasible solution. The strong duality theorem states that if the primal has an optimal solution, x*, then the dual also has an optimal solution, y*, and cTx*=bTy*.

A linear program can also be unbounded or infeasible. Duality theory tells us that if the primal is unbounded then the dual is infeasible by the weak duality theorem. Likewise, if the dual is unbounded, then the primal must be infeasible. However, it is possible for both the dual and the primal to be infeasible. See dual linear program for details and several more examples.

== Variations ==

=== Covering/packing dualities ===

A covering LP is a linear program of the form:
: Minimize: bTy,
: subject to: &quot;A&quot;Ty ≥ c, y ≥ 0,
such that the matrix &quot;A&quot; and the vectors b and c are non-negative.

The dual of a covering LP is a packing LP, a linear program of the form:
: Maximize: cTx,
: subject to: &quot;A&quot;x ≤ b, x ≥ 0,
such that the matrix &quot;A&quot; and the vectors b and c are non-negative.

==== Examples ====
Covering and packing LPs commonly arise as a linear programming relaxation of a combinatorial problem and are important in the study of approximation algorithms. For example, the LP relaxations of the set packing problem, the independent set problem, and the matching problem are packing LPs. The LP relaxations of the set cover problem, the vertex cover problem, and the dominating set problem are also covering LPs.

Finding a fractional coloring of a graph is another example of a covering LP. In this case, there is one constraint for each vertex of the graph and one variable for each independent set of the graph.

== Complementary slackness ==
It is possible to obtain an optimal solution to the dual when only an optimal solution to the primal is known using the complementary slackness theorem. The theorem states:

Suppose that x = (x1, x2, ... , x&quot;n&quot;) is primal feasible and that y = (y1, y2, ... , y&quot;m&quot;) is dual feasible. Let (w1, w2, ..., w&quot;m&quot;) denote the corresponding primal slack variables, and let (z1, z2, ... , z&quot;n&quot;) denote the corresponding dual slack variables. Then x and y are optimal for their respective problems if and only if
* x&quot;j&quot; z&quot;j&quot; = 0, for &quot;j&quot; = 1, 2, ... , &quot;n&quot;, and
* w&quot;i&quot; y&quot;i&quot; = 0, for &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, ... , &quot;m&quot;.

So if the &quot;i&quot;-th slack variable of the primal is not zero, then the &quot;i&quot;-th variable of the dual is equal to zero. Likewise, if the &quot;j&quot;-th slack variable of the dual is not zero, then the &quot;j&quot;-th variable of the primal is equal to zero.

This necessary condition for optimality conveys a fairly simple economic principle. In standard form (when maximizing), if there is slack in a constrained primal resource (i.e., there are &quot;leftovers&quot;), then additional quantities of that resource must have no value. Likewise, if there is slack in the dual (shadow) price non-negativity constraint requirement, i.e., the price is not zero, then there must be scarce supplies (no &quot;leftovers&quot;).

== Theory ==

=== Existence of optimal solutions ===
Geometrically, the linear constraints define the feasible region, which is a convex polytope. A linear function is a convex function, which implies that every local minimum is a global minimum; similarly, a linear function is a concave function, which implies that every local maximum is a global maximum.

An optimal solution need not exist, for two reasons. First, if the constraints are inconsistent, then no feasible solution exists: For instance, the constraints x ≥ 2 and x ≤ 1 cannot be satisfied jointly; in this case, we say that the LP is &quot;infeasible&quot;. Second, when the polytope is unbounded in the direction of the gradient of the objective function (where the gradient of the objective function is the vector of the coefficients of the objective function), then no optimal value is attained because it is always possible to do better than any finite value of the objective function.

=== Optimal vertices (and rays) of polyhedra ===
Otherwise, if a feasible solution exists and if the constraint set is bounded, then the optimum value is always attained on the boundary of the constraint set, by the &quot;maximum principle&quot; for &quot;convex functions&quot; (alternatively, by the &quot;minimum&quot; principle for &quot;concave functions&quot;) since linear functions are both convex and concave. However, some problems have distinct optimal solutions; for example, the problem of finding a feasible solution to a system of linear inequalities is a linear programming problem in which the objective function is the zero function (i.e., the constant function taking the value zero everywhere). For this feasibility problem with the zero-function for its objective-function, if there are two distinct solutions, then every convex combination of the solutions is a solution.

The vertices of the polytope are also called &quot;basic feasible solutions&quot;. The reason for this choice of name is as follows. Let &quot;d&quot; denote the number of variables. Then the fundamental theorem of linear inequalities implies (for feasible problems) that for every vertex x* of the LP feasible region, there exists a set of &quot;d&quot; (or fewer) inequality constraints from the LP such that, when we treat those &quot;d&quot; constraints as equalities, the unique solution is x*. Thereby we can study these vertices by means of looking at certain subsets of the set of all constraints (a discrete set), rather than the continuum of LP solutions. This principle underlies the simplex algorithm for solving linear programs.

== Algorithms ==


=== Basis exchange algorithms ===

==== Simplex algorithm of Dantzig ====

The simplex algorithm, developed by George Dantzig in 1947, solves LP problems by constructing a feasible solution at a vertex of the polytope and then walking along a path on the edges of the polytope to vertices with non-decreasing values of the objective function until an optimum is reached for sure. In many practical problems, &quot;stalling&quot; occurs: many pivots are made with no increase in the objective function. In rare practical problems, the usual versions of the simplex algorithm may actually &quot;cycle&quot;. To avoid cycles, researchers developed new pivoting rules.

In practice, the simplex algorithm is quite efficient and can be guaranteed to find the global optimum if certain precautions against &quot;cycling&quot; are taken. The simplex algorithm has been proved to solve &quot;random&quot; problems efficiently, i.e. in a cubic number of steps, which is similar to its behavior on practical problems.

However, the simplex algorithm has poor worst-case behavior: Klee and Minty constructed a family of linear programming problems for which the simplex method takes a number of steps exponential in the problem size. In fact, for some time it was not known whether the linear programming problem was solvable in polynomial time, i.e. of complexity class P.

==== Criss-cross algorithm ====
Like the simplex algorithm of Dantzig, the criss-cross algorithm is a basis-exchange algorithm that pivots between bases. However, the criss-cross algorithm need not maintain feasibility, but can pivot rather from a feasible basis to an infeasible basis. The criss-cross algorithm does not have polynomial time-complexity for linear programming. Both algorithms visit all 2&quot;D&quot; corners of a (perturbed) cube in dimension &quot;D&quot;, the Klee–Minty cube, in the worst case.

=== Interior point ===
In contrast to the simplex algorithm, which finds an optimal solution by traversing the edges between vertices on a polyhedral set, interior-point methods move through the interior of the feasible region.

==== Ellipsoid algorithm, following Khachiyan ====
This is the first worst-case polynomial-time algorithm ever found for linear programming. To solve a problem which has &quot;n&quot; variables and can be encoded in &quot;L&quot; input bits, this algorithm runs in formula_24 time. Leonid Khachiyan solved this long-standing complexity issue in 1979 with the introduction of the ellipsoid method. The convergence analysis has (real-number) predecessors, notably the iterative methods developed by Naum Z. Shor and the approximation algorithms by Arkadi Nemirovski and D. Yudin.

==== Projective algorithm of Karmarkar ====

Khachiyan&#x27;s algorithm was of landmark importance for establishing the polynomial-time solvability of linear programs. The algorithm was not a computational break-through, as the simplex method is more efficient for all but specially constructed families of linear programs.

However, Khachiyan&#x27;s algorithm inspired new lines of research in linear programming. In 1984, N. Karmarkar proposed a projective method for linear programming. Karmarkar&#x27;s algorithm improved on Khachiyan&#x27;s worst-case polynomial bound (giving formula_25). Karmarkar claimed that his algorithm was much faster in practical LP than the simplex method, a claim that created great interest in interior-point methods. Since Karmarkar&#x27;s discovery, many interior-point methods have been proposed and analyzed.

==== Vaidya&#x27;s 87 algorithm ====

In 1987, Vaidya proposed an algorithm that runs in formula_26 time.

==== Vaidya&#x27;s 89 algorithm ====
In 1989, Vaidya developed an algorithm that runs in formula_27 time. Formally speaking, the algorithm takes formula_28 arithmetic operations in the worst case, where formula_29 is the number of constraints, formula_30 is the number of variables, and formula_31 is the number of bits.

==== Input sparsity time algorithms ====
In 2015, Lee and Sidford showed that linear programming can be solved in formula_32 time, where formula_33 denotes the soft O notation, and formula_34 represents the number of non-zero elements, and it remains taking formula_35 in the worst case.

==== Current matrix multiplication time algorithm ====
In 2019, Cohen, Lee and Song improved the running time to formula_36 time, formula_37 is the exponent of matrix multiplication and formula_38 is the dual exponent of matrix multiplication. formula_38 is (roughly) defined to be the largest number such that one can multiply an formula_40 matrix by a formula_41 matrix in formula_42 time. In a followup work by Lee, Song and Zhang, they reproduce the same result via a different method. These two algorithms remain formula_43 when formula_44 and formula_45. The result due to Jiang, Song, Weinstein and Zhang improved formula_46 to formula_47.

=== Comparison of interior-point methods and simplex algorithms ===

The current opinion is that the efficiencies of good implementations of simplex-based methods and interior point methods are similar for routine applications of linear programming. However, for specific types of LP problems, it may be that one type of solver is better than another (sometimes much better), and that the structure of the solutions generated by interior point methods versus simplex-based methods are significantly different with the support set of active variables being typically smaller for the latter one.

== Open problems and recent work ==

There are several open problems in the theory of linear programming, the solution of which would represent fundamental breakthroughs in mathematics and potentially major advances in our ability to solve large-scale linear programs.
* Does LP admit a strongly polynomial-time algorithm?
* Does LP admit a strongly polynomial-time algorithm to find a strictly complementary solution?
* Does LP admit a polynomial-time algorithm in the real number (unit cost) model of computation?

This closely related set of problems has been cited by Stephen Smale as among the 18 greatest unsolved problems of the 21st century. In Smale&#x27;s words, the third version of the problem &quot;is the main unsolved problem of linear programming theory.&quot; While algorithms exist to solve linear programming in weakly polynomial time, such as the ellipsoid methods and interior-point techniques, no algorithms have yet been found that allow strongly polynomial-time performance in the number of constraints and the number of variables. The development of such algorithms would be of great theoretical interest, and perhaps allow practical gains in solving large LPs as well.

Although the Hirsch conjecture was recently disproved for higher dimensions, it still leaves the following questions open.
* Are there pivot rules which lead to polynomial-time simplex variants?
* Do all polytopal graphs have polynomially bounded diameter?

These questions relate to the performance analysis and development of simplex-like methods. The immense efficiency of the simplex algorithm in practice despite its exponential-time theoretical performance hints that there may be variations of simplex that run in polynomial or even strongly polynomial time. It would be of great practical and theoretical significance to know whether any such variants exist, particularly as an approach to deciding if LP can be solved in strongly polynomial time.

The simplex algorithm and its variants fall in the family of edge-following algorithms, so named because they solve linear programming problems by moving from vertex to vertex along edges of a polytope. This means that their theoretical performance is limited by the maximum number of edges between any two vertices on the LP polytope. As a result, we are interested in knowing the maximum graph-theoretical diameter of polytopal graphs. It has been proved that all polytopes have subexponential diameter. The recent disproof of the Hirsch conjecture is the first step to prove whether any polytope has superpolynomial diameter. If any such polytopes exist, then no edge-following variant can run in polynomial time. Questions about polytope diameter are of independent mathematical interest.

Simplex pivot methods preserve primal (or dual) feasibility. On the other hand, criss-cross pivot methods do not preserve (primal or dual) feasibilitythey may visit primal feasible, dual feasible or primal-and-dual infeasible bases in any order. Pivot methods of this type have been studied since the 1970s. Essentially, these methods attempt to find the shortest pivot path on the arrangement polytope under the linear programming problem. In contrast to polytopal graphs, graphs of arrangement polytopes are known to have small diameter, allowing the possibility of strongly polynomial-time criss-cross pivot algorithm without resolving questions about the diameter of general polytopes.

== Integer unknowns ==
If all of the unknown variables are required to be integers, then the problem is called an integer programming (IP) or integer linear programming (ILP) problem. In contrast to linear programming, which can be solved efficiently in the worst case, integer programming problems are in many practical situations (those with bounded variables) NP-hard. 0–1 integer programming or binary integer programming (BIP) is the special case of integer programming where variables are required to be 0 or 1 (rather than arbitrary integers). This problem is also classified as NP-hard, and in fact the decision version was one of Karp&#x27;s 21 NP-complete problems.

If only some of the unknown variables are required to be integers, then the problem is called a mixed integer (linear) programming (MIP or MILP) problem. These are generally also NP-hard because they are even more general than ILP programs.

There are however some important subclasses of IP and MIP problems that are efficiently solvable, most notably problems where the constraint matrix is totally unimodular and the right-hand sides of the constraints are integers or – more general – where the system has the total dual integrality (TDI) property.

Advanced algorithms for solving integer linear programs include:
* cutting-plane method
* Branch and bound
* Branch and cut
* Branch and price
* if the problem has some extra structure, it may be possible to apply delayed column generation.
Such integer-programming algorithms are discussed by Padberg and in Beasley.

== Integral linear programs ==

A linear program in real variables is said to be integral if it has at least one optimal solution which is integral, i.e., made of only integer values. Likewise, a polyhedron formula_48 is said to be integral if for all bounded feasible objective functions &quot;c&quot;, the linear program formula_49 has an optimum formula_50 with integer coordinates. As observed by Edmonds and Giles in 1977, one can equivalently say that the polyhedron formula_51 is integral if for every bounded feasible integral objective function &quot;c&quot;, the optimal &quot;value&quot; of the linear program formula_49 is an integer.

Integral linear programs are of central importance in the polyhedral aspect of combinatorial optimization since they provide an alternate characterization of a problem. Specifically, for any problem, the convex hull of the solutions is an integral polyhedron; if this polyhedron has a nice/compact description, then we can efficiently find the optimal feasible solution under any linear objective. Conversely, if we can prove that a linear programming relaxation is integral, then it is the desired description of the convex hull of feasible (integral) solutions.

Terminology is not consistent throughout the literature, so one should be careful to distinguish the following two concepts,
* in an &quot;integer linear program,&quot; described in the previous section, variables are forcibly constrained to be integers, and this problem is NP-hard in general,
* in an &quot;integral linear program,&quot; described in this section, variables are not constrained to be integers but rather one has proven somehow that the continuous problem always has an integral optimal value (assuming &quot;c&quot; is integral), and this optimal value may be found efficiently since all polynomial-size linear programs can be solved in polynomial time.

One common way of proving that a polyhedron is integral is to show that it is totally unimodular. There are other general methods including the integer decomposition property and total dual integrality. Other specific well-known integral LPs include the matching polytope, lattice polyhedra, submodular flow polyhedra, and the intersection of two generalized polymatroids/&quot;g&quot;-polymatroids – e.g. see Schrijver 2003.

<text>Year 295 ([[Roman numerals|CCXCV]]) was a common year starting on Tuesday of the Julian calendar, the 295th Year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 295th year of the 1st millennium, the 95th year and last 6 years of the 3rd century, and the 6th year of the 290s decade. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of [[Nummius Tuscus|Tuscus]] and [[Gaius Annius Anullinus|Anullinus]] (or, less frequently, year 1048 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 295 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>Year 296 ([[Roman numerals|CCXCVI]]) was a leap year starting on Wednesday of the Julian calendar. In the Roman Empire, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Diocletian and Constantius (or, less frequently, year 1049 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 296 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Roman Empire ====
* In this or the previous year, Caesar Constantius I assembles two invasion fleets with the intent of overthrowing the usurper Allectus, who is based in Britain. The first is under the command of Asclepiodotus, Maximian&#x27;s long-serving Praetorian Prefect. Asclepiodotus sails from the mouth of the Seine, and lands near the Isle of Wight, where his forces defeat Allectus in Hampshire. Allectus is killed in the fighting. Constantius leaves Boulogne with his fleet, and occupies London, where he slaughters some of Allectus&#x27; Frankish mercenaries. With this victory, the Romano-British regime first established by Carausius is overthrown, and Britain is re-incorporated into the rest of the empire.
* Having supervised the Rhine frontier during Constantius&#x27; invasion of Britain, Maximian then marches into Spain, where he fights Frankish pirates. He then crosses into North Africa to contend with the rebellion of the Quinquegentiani.
* The Persian king Narseh invades Roman-held Upper Mesopotamia and Arsacid western Armenia, the latter territory being under the leadership of the pro-Roman king Tiridates III. With only a small army, Caesar Galerius fights three holding actions against Narseh&#x27;s army in Mesopotamia. Somewhere in the open plains between Carrhae and Callinicum, Galerius&#x27; army suffers a defeat against the Persian army, which is both more numerous and contains superior numbers of high-quality cavalry. Nevertheless, Galerius succeeds in blunting the Persian offensive.

=== By topic ===
==== Religion ====
* April 22 – Pope Caius dies after a 13-year reign and is succeeded by Marcellinus as the 29th pope of Rome.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Yu Bing (or Jijian), Chinese politician (d. 344)

== Deaths ==

<text>In telecommunications and computer networking, a network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network. A packet consists of control information and user data; the latter is also known as the &quot;payload&quot;. Control information provides data for delivering the payload (e.g., source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, or sequencing information). Typically, control information is found in packet headers and trailers.

In packet switching, the bandwidth of the transmission medium is shared between multiple communication sessions, in contrast to circuit switching, in which circuits are preallocated for the duration of one session and data is typically transmitted as a continuous bit stream.

== Terminology ==
In the seven-layer OSI model of computer networking, &quot;packet&quot; strictly refers to a protocol data unit at layer 3, the network layer. A data unit at layer 2, the data link layer, is a &quot;frame&quot;. In layer 4, the transport layer, the data units are &quot;segments&quot; and &quot;datagrams&quot;. Thus, in the example of TCP/IP communication over Ethernet, a TCP segment is carried in one or more IP packets, which are each carried in one or more Ethernet frames.

== Architecture ==
The basis of the packet concept is the postal letter: the header is like the envelope, the payload is the entire content inside the envelope, and the footer would be your signature at the bottom.

Network design can achieve two major results by using packets: &quot;error detection&quot; and &quot;multiple host addressing&quot;.

== Framing ==
Communications protocols use various conventions for distinguishing the elements of a packet and for formatting the user data. For example, in Point-to-Point Protocol, the packet is formatted in 8-bit bytes, and special characters are used to delimit elements. Other protocols, like Ethernet, establish the start of the header and data elements by their location relative to the start of the packet. Some protocols format the information at a bit level instead of a byte level.

== Contents ==
A packet may contain any of the following components:

;Addresses
:The routing of network packets requires two network addresses, the source address of the sending host, and the destination address of the receiving host.

;Error detection and correction
:Error detection and correction is performed at various layers in the protocol stack. Network packets may contain a checksum, parity bits or cyclic redundancy checks to detect errors that occur during transmission.

:At the transmitter, the calculation is performed before the packet is sent. When received at the destination, the checksum is recalculated, and compared with the one in the packet. If discrepancies are found, the packet may be corrected or discarded. Any packet loss due to these discards is dealt with by the network protocol.

:In some cases, modifications of the network packet may be necessary while routing, in which cases checksums are recalculated.

;Hop limit
:Under fault conditions, packets can end up traversing a closed circuit. If nothing was done, eventually the number of packets circulating would build up until the network was congested to the point of failure. Time to live is a field that is decreased by one each time a packet goes through a network hop. If the field reaches zero, routing has failed, and the packet is discarded.

:Ethernet packets have no time-to-live field and so are subject to broadcast storms in the presence of a switching loop.

;Length
:There may be a field to identify the overall packet length. However, in some types of networks, the length is implied by the duration of the transmission.

;Protocol identifier
:It is often desirable to carry multiple communication protocols on a network. A protocol identifier field specifies a packet&#x27;s protocol and allows the protocol stack to process many types of packets.

;Priority
:Some networks implement quality of service which can prioritize some types of packets above others. This field indicates which packet queue should be used; a high-priority queue is emptied more quickly than lower-priority queues at points in the network where congestion is occurring. 

;Payload
:In general, the payload is the data that is carried on behalf of an application. It is usually of variable length, up to a maximum that is set by the network protocol and sometimes the equipment on the route. When necessary, some networks can break a larger packet into smaller packets.

== Examples ==

=== Internet protocol ===
IP packets are composed of a header and payload. The header consists of fixed and optional fields. The payload appears immediately after the header. An IP packet has no trailer. However, an IP packet is often carried as the payload inside an Ethernet frame, which has its own header and trailer.

Per the end-to-end principle, IP networks do not provide guarantees of delivery, non-duplication, or in-order delivery of packets. However, it is common practice to layer a reliable transport protocol such as Transmission Control Protocol on top of the packet service to provide such protection.

=== NASA Deep Space Network ===
The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) packet telemetry standard defines the protocol used for the transmission of spacecraft instrument data over the deep-space channel. Under this standard, an image or other data sent from a spacecraft instrument is transmitted using one or more packets.

=== MPEG packetized stream ===
Packetized elementary stream (PES) is a specification associated with the MPEG-2 standard that allows an elementary stream to be divided into packets. The elementary stream is packetized by encapsulating sequential data bytes from the elementary stream between PES packet headers.

A typical method of transmitting elementary stream data from a video or audio encoder is to first create PES packets from the elementary stream data and then to encapsulate these PES packets inside an MPEG transport stream (TS) packets or an MPEG program stream (PS). The TS packets can then be transmitted using broadcasting techniques, such as those used in an ATSC and DVB.

=== NICAM ===
In order to provide mono &quot;compatibility&quot;, the NICAM signal is transmitted on a subcarrier alongside the sound carrier. This means that the FM or AM regular mono sound carrier is left alone for reception by monaural receivers. The NICAM packet (except for the header) is scrambled with a nine-bit pseudo-random bit-generator before transmission. Making the NICAM bitstream look more like white noise is important because this reduces signal patterning on adjacent TV channels.

<text>Year 293 ([[Roman numerals|CCXCIII]]) was a common year starting on Sunday of the Julian calendar. In the Roman Empire, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] (or, less frequently, year 1046 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 293 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Roman Empire ====
* March 1 – Emperors Diocletian and Maximian appoint Constantius I and Galerius as Caesars. This is considered the beginning of the Tetrarchy, known as the &quot;Quattuor Principes Mundi&quot; (&quot;Four Rulers of the World&quot;). (Some sources and scholars date Galerius&#x27; elevation to May 21.)
* Constantius retakes some of the Gallic territories from the usurper Carausius. He conquers the crucial port of Bononia (modern Boulogne).
* Towards the end of the year, Carausius is murdered by his finance minister Allectus, who proclaims himself the new emperor of Britain.
* In this or the following year, Constantius defeats the Franks in Batavia (Netherlands).
* Galerius begins a series of two campaigns in Upper Egypt against the rebel cities of Coptos and Boresis as well as the Blemmyes and Meroitic Nubians.
* Over the course of his reign, but especially from the time of the Tetrarchy&#x27;s creation, Diocletian divides the large provinces of the early empire into smaller administrative units, and he groups these new smaller provinces into dioceses. He also accelerates the third-century trend whereby the administration and military of the provinces are increasingly divided between governors and generals (&quot;duces&quot;) respectively, whereas formerly governors had also been in charge of the legions. This expansion of imperial personnel increases Diocletian&#x27;s control over the empire and weakens the power of individual officials and officers. Moreover, Diocletian expands the retinues of the individual emperors to have more ministers and secretaries, thus establishing what will become known as the late Roman Consistorium.

==== Persia ====
* King Bahram II of the Persian Empire dies after a 17-year reign; his son Bahram III ascends to the throne. After four months, Bahram III&#x27;s great-uncle Narseh, the king of Persarmenia, marches on the Persian capital Ctesiphon with the support of a faction of the nobility and the eastern Satraps. Bahram is overthrown and Narseh is declared the new King of Kings.

==== China ====
* Tuoba Fu succeeds his uncle Tuoba Chuo, as chieftain of the Chinese Tuoba Clan.

=== By topic ===
==== Religion ====
* Probus succeeds Rufinus, as Bishop of Byzantium.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
== Deaths ==
* Bahram II, king of the Sassanid Empire
* Bahram III, king of the Sassanid Empire
* Carausius, Roman general and usurper 
* Tuoba Chuo, Chinese chieftain of the Tuoba tribe
* Yuwen Mohuai, Chinese chieftain of the Yuwen tribe

==== Roman Empire ====
* Winter: The emperors Diocletian and Maximian convene in Milan.
* An uneasy peace is established between the emperors Diocletian and Maximian on the one hand, and the rival emperor Carausius on the other.
* Perhaps in cooperation with the forces of Maximian, Carausius campaigns successfully against Germanic raids in Gaul and Britain. Also during his reign, Carausius begins building the forts of the Saxon Shore.

==== Northern Europe ====
* The Alemanni, having been expelled from part of their territory by the Burgundians, seek to regain their lost lands. These peoples had unsuccessfully invaded Gaul in tandem in 285/6, and the Alemanni had likely been weakened by the Roman counter-invasions of 287 and 288.
* A force of Goths defeat the Burgundians.
* The Tervingian Goths and Taifali fight the Vandals and Gepids.

==== Africa ====
* The Blemmyes invade the Kingdom of Kush.

==== Persian Empire ====
* King Bahram II fights against a coalition consisting of his brother Hormizd of Sakastan, the Kushano-Sasanians, and the Gilans.

==== China ====
* War of the Eight Princes: After the death of Emperor Sima Yan (Jin Wudi), a civil war breaks out among the princes and dukes of the Jin Dynasty. The struggle devastates and depopulates the provinces of northern China.

==== Roman Empire ====
* On the same day that he is made consul, Maximian launches a campaign against an invasion of Gaul by the Alemanni. After defeating this invasion, he then invades Alemannia itself, entering across the Upper Rhine and returning to Roman territory via the Upper Danube.
* Around this time, the future emperor Constantius defeats and captures a Germanic king, the latter having prepared an ambush against the Romans.
* Diocletian signs a peace treaty with King Bahram II of Persia, and installs the pro-Roman Arsacid Tiridates III as king over the western portion of Armenia.
* Diocletian re-organizes the Mesopotamian frontier, and fortifies various locations including the city of Circesium (modern Busayrah) on the Euphrates. Around this time, he begins the construction of the Strata Diocletiana. Throughout his reign, similar fortification efforts are conducted on the other frontiers as well, with fortifications constructed or restored behind, on and beyond the borders. Conscription and the number of legions increase, although the legions themselves are reformed into smaller and more flexible units. At some point in time, Diocletian may have also established the late Roman military system of Comitatenses (field army units) and Limitanei (border units), but some scholars date this development to the reign of Constantine I (r. 306–337).
* September – The first Indiction begins.

<text>Year 274 ([[Roman numerals|CCLXXIV]]) was a common year starting on Thursday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Aurelianus and Capitolinus (or, less frequently, year 1027 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 274 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Roman Empire ====
* Battle of Châlons: The Emperor Aurelian invades Gaul to campaign against the Gallic Empire (Gaul and Britain). In the Catalaunian Plains, the Romano-Gallic Emperor Tetricus I surrenders to Aurelian and leaves his army without an emperor. The Gallic army is then crushed by Aurelian in a major battle. With the conquests of the Palmyrene Empire and the Gallic Empire, the Roman Empire is united again. However, the heavy losses incurred by the Gallic forces compromises the Rhine frontier.
* Rome greets Aurelian as &quot;Restitutor Orbis&quot; (&quot;Restorer of the World&quot;) and accords him a magnificent triumph (victory procession), which is graced by his captives Zenobia, Tetricus I, and his son Tetricus II. 
* Aurelian reforms the Roman currency, replacing the denarius with a new version of the antoninianus that has a slightly improved silver-to-copper ratio. This overhaul of the currency system causes hyper-inflation. 
* Germanic tribes take advantage of the destroyed Roman forces of the Rhine to raid Gaul.
* December 25 – Aurelian has the Temple of the Sun dedicated to Sol Invictus, on the third day after the solstice and day of rebirth of the sun. This religion, which is in essence monotheistic, becomes the state religion of Rome.

==== Africa ====
* The Kingdom of Aksum attains great prosperity thanks to its control of Red Sea trade.

=== By topic ===
==== Religion ====
* March 2 – Mani, a sage of Persia, dies at Gundeshapur after 30 years of preaching his &quot;heresy&quot; at the court of the late Sassanian King Shapur I and on long journeys to Khorasan, India and China. He is executed or allowed to die in prison, and claims to be a prophet of God. Mani combines Zoroastrian dualism with Christian theology, and his disciples gain wide support for Manichaeism, despite opposition from Roman Emperors.
* December 30 – Pope Felix I dies in Rome after a 5-year reign.

==== Transportation ====
* Japanese shipwrights build a 100-foot oar-powered vessel for Emperor Ōjin. The Japanese will not use sails for another seven centuries.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Li Xiong, Chinese emperor of Cheng Han (d. 334)
* Shi Le, Chinese emperor of the Jie state (d. 333)

== Deaths ==
* March 2 – Mani, prophet and founder of Manichaeism (b. 216)
* June 19 – Xun Yi (or Jingqian), Chinese official and politician
* August 25 – Yang Yan (or Qiongzhi), Chinese empress (b. 238)
* August/September – Lu Kang (or Youjie), Chinese general and politician (b. 226)
* September – Bahram I, king of the Sassanid Empire
* December 30 – Felix I, bishop of Rome
* Cao Fang, deposed Chinese emperor of the Cao Wei state (b. 232)
* After 274 – Septimia Zenobia, queen of the Palmyrene Empire (b. 240)

=== By place ===
==== Roman Empire ====
* Emperor Aurelian launches a two-pronged invasion of the Palmyrene Empire, sending his commander Marcus Aurelius Probus to restore Roman rule in Egypt while he marches into Asia Minor. 
* As part of a strategy of clemency, Aurelian spares Tyana after capturing the city. This strategy encourages units under Zenobia to defect to Aurelian.
* Battle of Immae: Aurelian defeats the Palmyrene heavy cavalry (&quot;clibanarii&quot;) near Antioch. Queen Zenobia flees under cover of darkness to Emesa (Syria).
* Aurelian supports the bishops of Italy in deposing the bishop of Antioch, Paul of Samosata, who had been a supporter of Zenobia. This is the first recorded instance of an imperial intervention in an ecclesiastical dispute.
* Battle of Emesa: Aurelian decisively defeats the Palmyrene army. 
* Aurelian besieges Palmyra. Zenobia attempts to escape to Persia but is captured on the Euphrates. Palmyra surrenders soon after.
* Following a series of trials held in Emesa, Cassius Longinus and other advisors of Zenobia are executed for conspiring against Aurelian.

<text>Year 276 ([[Roman numerals|CCLXXVI]]) was a leap year starting on Saturday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Tacitus and Aemilianus (or, less frequently, year 1029 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 276 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Roman Empire ====
* Emperor Tacitus doubles the silver content of the aurelianianus, and halves its tariffing to 2.5 d.c. They carry the value marks X.I.
* Tacitus campaigns successfully against the Goths who have invaded Asia Minor, and his half-brother, the praetorian prefect Marcus Annius Florianus, continues the campaign. 
* Tacitus&#x27; cousin Maximinus administers Syria in a harsh manner, and is assassinated by local men of power, who are joined in the conspiracy by the faction responsible for having assassinated Aurelian in the previous year. 
* Tacitus dies in Tyana, Cappadocia. He either dies of illness, or is murdered by the faction responsible for having assassinated Aurelian and Maximinus.
* Florianus becomes Roman Emperor with the support of the Senate, but a general in the east, Marcus Aurelius Probus, usurps power against him. Florianus breaks off his campaign against the Goths and marches east from the Bosporus with support from the Roman legions in Britain, Gaul, Spain and Italy.
* Florianus holds power for some weeks and fights indecisively against Probus in Cilicia, but his soldiers, many of whom are from the colder Rhine and Danube frontiers, suffer from heat and disease. He is overthrown and then assassinated by his own troops near Tarsus (Turkey), in collusion with Probus. Probus, age 44, is proclaimed new Emperor of Rome.
* Probus returns the aurelianianus to the tariffing of Aurelian.
* Probus invites the faction responsible for the murders of Aurelian and Tacitus to a banquet, only to massacre them. He then arrests a surviving conspirator and has him burned alive.

==== Sassanid Empire ====
* King Bahram I of Persia dies after a 3-year reign, in which the Zoroastrian priests at Ctesiphon (Iran) put pressure on him to persecute Buddhists, Christians, and Manichaeans. He is succeeded by his son Bahram II.

==== Asia ====
* Mahasena reigns in Ceylon. Orthodox and unpopular, he tries to introduce Mahayana Buddhism to the country.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Gregory the Elder, bishop of Nazianzus (approximate date)
* Guo Pu, Chinese historian, poet and writer (d. 324)
* Wang Dao, Chinese politician and statesman (d. 339)
* Yuan of Jin, Chinese emperor of the Jin Dynasty (d. 323)

== Deaths ==
* Bahram I, king of the Sassanid Empire
* Marcus Annius Florianus, Roman emperor
* Marcus Claudius Tacitus, Roman Emperor

<text>Year 275 ([[Roman numerals|CCLXXV]]) was a common year starting on Friday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Aurelianus and Marcellinus (or, less frequently, year 1028 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 275 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
=== By place ===

==== Roman Empire ====
* Emperor Aurelian puts down unrest in Gaul, and defeats Germanic incursions into Gaul and Raetia (these problems have been caused by Aurelian&#x27;s defeat and overthrow of the Gallic Empire).
* The Goths begin to raid Thrace and Asia Minor. Aurelian begins a campaign against the Goths in Thrace.
* c. November – Aurelian is assassinated near Byzantium (Turkey). Aurelian has developed a reputation for punishing corruption with severity, and his secretary Eros is under suspicion. As a result, Eros, fearing for his life, has forged a list of high-ranking officers marked for execution. In this way, the secretary tricks the officers into assassinating Aurelian, and they then flee into Asia Minor to avoid the wrath of the soldiers.
* November/December – Marcus Claudius Tacitus is proclaimed Emperor by the imperial field army (other sources give him as proclaimed September 25 by the Senate). His half brother Marcus Annius Florianus becomes praetorian prefect.
* Tacitus marches into Asia Minor to fight the Goths and track down the faction responsible for assassinating Aurelian.

==== Asia ====
* The Pallava dynasty begins in Southern India.
* Approximate date – Himyar king Shammar Yahri&#x27;sh conquers Hadhramaut, Najran and Tihamah, unifying the territory later known as Yemen.
