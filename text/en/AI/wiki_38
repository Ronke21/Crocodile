<text>In mathematics and theoretical computer science, a type theory is the formal presentation of a specific type system. Type theory is the academic study of type systems. 

Some type theories serve as alternatives to set theory as a foundation of mathematics. Two influential type theories that have been proposed as foundations are: 

* Typed λ-calculus of Alonzo Church
* Intuitionistic type theory of Per Martin-Löf

Most computerized proof-writing systems use a type theory for their foundation. A common one is Thierry Coquand&#x27;s Calculus of Inductive Constructions.

==History==

Type theory was created to avoid a paradox in a mathematical equation based on naive set theory and formal logic. Russell&#x27;s paradox (first described in Gottlob Frege&#x27;s The Foundations of Arithmetic) is that, without proper axioms, it is possible to define the set of all sets that are not members of themselves; this set both contains itself and does not contain itself. Between 1902 and 1908, Bertrand Russell proposed various solutions to this problem.

By 1908, Russell arrived at a ramified theory of types together with an axiom of reducibility, both of which appeared in Whitehead and Russell&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; published in 1910, 1912, and 1913. This system avoided contradictions suggested in Russell&#x27;s paradox by creating a hierarchy of types and then assigning each concrete mathematical entity to a specific type. Entities of a given type were built exclusively of subtypes of that type, thus preventing an entity from being defined using itself. This resolution of Russell&#x27;s paradox is similar to approaches taken in other formal systems, such as Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.

Type theory is particularly popular in conjunction with Alonzo Church&#x27;s lambda calculus. One notable early example of type theory is Church&#x27;s simply typed lambda calculus. Church&#x27;s theory of types helped the formal system avoid the Kleene–Rosser paradox that afflicted the original untyped lambda calculus. Church demonstrated that it could serve as a foundation of mathematics and it was referred to as a higher-order logic.

In the modern literature, &quot;type theory&quot; refers to a typed system based around lambda calculus. One influential system is Per Martin-Löf&#x27;s intuitionistic type theory, which was proposed as a foundation for constructive mathematics. Another is Thierry Coquand&#x27;s calculus of constructions, which is used as the foundation by Coq, Lean, and other computer proof assistants. Type theory is an active area of research, one direction being the development of homotopy type theory.

==Applications==

===Mathematical foundations===
The first computer proof assistant, called Automath, used type theory to encode mathematics on a computer. Martin-Löf specifically developed intuitionistic type theory to encode &quot;all&quot; mathematics to serve as a new foundation for mathematics. There is ongoing research into mathematical foundations using homotopy type theory.

Mathematicians working in category theory already had difficulty working with the widely accepted foundation of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. This led to proposals such as Lawvere&#x27;s Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets (ETCS). Homotopy type theory continues in this line using type theory. Researchers are exploring connections between dependent types (especially the identity type) and algebraic topology (specifically homotopy).

===Proof assistants===

Much of the current research into type theory is driven by proof checkers, interactive proof assistants, and automated theorem provers. Most of these systems use a type theory as the mathematical foundation for encoding proofs, which is not surprising, given the close connection between type theory and programming languages:
* LF is used by Twelf, often to define other type theories;
* many type theories which fall under higher-order logic are used by the HOL family of provers and PVS;
* computational type theory is used by NuPRL;
* calculus of constructions and its derivatives are used by Coq, Matita, and Lean;
* UTT (Luo&#x27;s Unified Theory of dependent Types) is used by Agda which is both a programming language and proof assistant

Many type theories are supported by LEGO and Isabelle. Isabelle also supports foundations besides type theories, such as ZFC. Mizar is an example of a proof system that only supports set theory.

===Programming languages===
Any static program analysis, such as the type checking algorithms in the semantic analysis phase of compiler, has a connection to type theory. A prime example is Agda, a programming language which uses UTT (Luo&#x27;s Unified Theory of dependent Types) for its type system.

The programming language ML was developed for manipulating type theories (see LCF) and its own type system was heavily influenced by them.

===Linguistics===
Type theory is also widely used in formal theories of semantics of natural languages, especially Montague grammar and its descendants. In particular, categorial grammars and pregroup grammars extensively use type constructors to define the types (&quot;noun&quot;, &quot;verb&quot;, etc.) of words.

The most common construction takes the basic types formula_1 and formula_2 for individuals and truth-values, respectively, and defines the set of types recursively as follows:
* if formula_3 and formula_4 are types, then so is formula_5;
* nothing except the basic types, and what can be constructed from them by means of the previous clause are types.

A complex type formula_5 is the type of functions from entities of type formula_3 to entities of type formula_4. Thus one has types like formula_9 which are interpreted as elements of the set of functions from entities to truth-values, i.e. indicator functions of sets of entities. An expression of type formula_10 is a function from sets of entities to truth-values, i.e. a (indicator function of a) set of sets. This latter type is standardly taken to be the type of natural language quantifiers, like &quot; everybody&quot; or &quot;nobody&quot; (Montague 1973, Barwise and Cooper 1981).

Type theory with records is a formal semantics representation framework, using &quot;records&quot; to express &quot;type theory types&quot;. It has been used in natural language processing, principally computational semantics and dialogue systems.

===Social sciences===
Gregory Bateson introduced a theory of logical types into the social sciences; his notions of double bind and logical levels are based on Russell&#x27;s theory of types.

==Logic==
A type theory is a mathematical logic, which is to say it is a collection of rules of inference that result in judgments. Most logics have judgments asserting &quot;The proposition formula_11 is true&quot;, or &quot;The formula formula_11 is a well-formed formula&quot;. A type theory has judgments that define types and assign them to a collection of formal objects, known as terms. A term and its type are often written together as formula_13.

===Terms===
A term in logic is recursively defined as a constant symbol, variable, or a function application, where a term is applied to another term. Constant symbols could include the natural number formula_14, the Boolean value formula_15, and functions such as the successor function formula_16 and conditional operator formula_17. Thus some terms could be formula_14, formula_19, formula_20, and formula_21.

===Judgments===
Most type theories have 4 judgments:

* &quot;formula_22 is a type&quot;
* &quot;formula_2 is a term of type formula_22&quot;
* &quot;Type formula_25 is equal to type formula_26&quot;
* &quot;Terms formula_27 and formula_28 both of type formula_22 are equal&quot;

Judgments may follow from assumptions. For example, one might say &quot;assuming formula_30 is a term of type formula_31 and formula_32 is a term of type formula_33, it follows that formula_34 is a term of type formula_33&quot;. Such judgments are formally written with the turnstile symbol formula_36.

formula_37

If there are no assumptions, there will be nothing to the left of the turnstile.

formula_38

The list of assumptions on the left is the &quot;context&quot; of the judgment. Capital greek letters, such as formula_39 and formula_40, are common choices to represent some or all of the assumptions. The 4 different judgments are thus usually written as follows.

Some textbooks use a triple equal sign formula_41 to stress that this is judgmental equality and thus an extrinsic notion of equality. The judgments enforce that every term has a type. The type will restrict which rules can be applied to a term.

===Rules of Inference===
A type theory&#x27;s inference rules say what judgments can be made, based on the existence of other judgments. Rules are expressed as a Gentzen-style deduction using a horizontal line, with the required input judgments above the line and the resulting judgment below the line. For example, the following inference rule states a substitution rule for judgmental equality.formula_42The rules are syntactic and work by rewriting. The metavariables formula_39, formula_40, formula_2, formula_25, and formula_26 may actually consist of complex terms and types that contain many function applications, not just single symbols.

To generate a particular judgment in type theory, there must be a rule to generate it, as well as rules to generate all of that rule&#x27;s required inputs, and so on. The applied rules form a proof tree, where the top-most rules need no assumptions. One example of a rule that does not require any inputs is one that states the type of a constant term. For example, to assert that there is a term formula_14 of type formula_33, one would write the following.formula_50

==== Type inhabitation ====

Generally, the desired conclusion of a proof in type theory is one of type inhabitation. The decision problem of type inhabitation (abbreviated by formula_51) is: 
:Given a context formula_39 and a type formula_53, decide whether there exists a term formula_2 that can be assigned the type formula_53 in the type environment formula_39.
Girard&#x27;s paradox shows that type inhabitation is strongly related to the consistency of a type system with Curry–Howard correspondence. To be sound, such a system must have uninhabited types.

A type theory usually has several rules, including ones to:
* create a judgment (known as a &quot;context&quot; in this case)
* add an assumption to the context (context &quot;weakening&quot;)
* rearrange the assumptions
* use an assumption to create a variable
* define reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity for judgmental equality
* define substitution for application of lambda terms
* list all the interactions of equality, such as substitution
* define a hierarchy of type universes
* assert the existence of new types

Also, for each &quot;by rule&quot; type, there are 4 different kinds of rules

* &quot;type formation&quot; rules say how to create the type
* &quot;term introduction&quot; rules define the canonical terms and constructor functions, like &quot;pair&quot; and &quot;S&quot;.
* &quot;term elimination&quot; rules define the other functions like &quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot;, and &quot;R&quot;.
* &quot;computation&quot; rules specify how computation is performed with the type-specific functions.

For examples of rules, an interested reader may follow Appendix A.2 of the &quot;Homotopy Type Theory&quot; book, or read Martin-Löf&#x27;s Intuitionistic Type Theory.

==Connections to foundations==
The logical framework of a type theory bears a resemblance to intuitionistic, or constructive, logic. Formally, type theory is often cited as an implementation of the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation of intuitionistic logic. Additionally, connections can be made to category theory and computer programs.

===Intuitionistic logic===
When used as a foundation, certain types are interpreted to be propositions (statements that can be proven), and terms inhabiting the type are interpreted to be proofs of that proposition. When some types are interpreted as propositions, there is a set of common types that can be used to connect them to make a Boolean algebra out of types. However, the logic is not classical logic but intuitionistic logic, which is to say it does not have the law of excluded middle nor double negation.

Under this intuitionistic interpretation, there are common types that act as the logical operators:
Because the law of excluded middle does not hold, there is no term of type formula_57. Likewise, double negation does not hold, so there is no term of type formula_58.

It is possible to include the law of excluded middle and double negation into a type theory, by rule or assumption. However, terms may not compute down to canonical terms and it will interfere with the ability to determine if two terms are judgementally equal to each other.

==== Constructive mathematics ====
Per Martin-Löf proposed his intuitionistic type theory as a foundation for constructive mathematics. Constructive mathematics requires when proving &quot;there exists an formula_30 with property formula_60&quot;, one must construct a particular formula_30 and a proof that it has property formula_62. In type theory, existence is accomplished using the dependent product type, and its proof requires a term of that type.

An example of a non-constructive proof is proof by contradiction. The first step is assuming that formula_30 does not exist and refuting it by contradiction. The conclusion from that step is &quot;it is not the case that formula_30 does not exist&quot;. The last step is, by double negation, concluding that formula_30 exists. Constructive mathematics does not allow the last step of removing the double negation to conclude that formula_30 exists.

Most of the type theories proposed as foundations are constructive, and this includes most of the ones used by proof assistants. It is possible to add non-constructive features to a type theory, by rule or assumption. These include operators on continuations such as call with current continuation. However, these operators tend to break desirable properties such as canonicity and parametricity.

===Curry-Howard correspondence===
The Curry–Howard correspondence is the observed similarity between logics and programming languages. The implication in logic, &quot;A formula_67 B&quot; resembles a function from type &quot;A&quot; to type &quot;B&quot;. For a variety of logics, the rules are similar to expressions in a programming language&#x27;s types. The similarity goes farther, as applications of the rules resemble programs in the programming languages. Thus, the correspondence is often summarized as &quot;proofs as programs&quot;.

The opposition of terms and types can also be viewed as one of &quot;implementation&quot; and &quot;specification&quot;. By program synthesis, (the computational counterpart of) type inhabitation can be used to construct (all or parts of) programs from the specification given in the form of type information.

====Type inference====
Many programs that work with type theory (e.g., interactive theorem provers) also do type inferencing. It lets them select the rules that the user intends, with fewer actions by the user.

===Research areas===

==== Category theory ====

Although the initial motivation for category theory was far removed from foundationalism, the two fields turned out to have deep connections. As John Lane Bell writes: &quot;In fact categories can &quot;themselves&quot; be viewed as type theories of a certain kind; this fact alone indicates that type theory is much more closely related to category theory than it is to set theory.&quot; In brief, a category can be viewed as a type theory by regarding its objects as types (or &quot;sorts&quot; ), i.e. &quot;Roughly speaking, a category may be thought of as a type theory shorn of its syntax.&quot; A number of significant results follow in this way:
* cartesian closed categories correspond to the typed λ-calculus (Lambek, 1970);
* C-monoids (categories with products and exponentials and one non-terminal object) correspond to the untyped λ-calculus (observed independently by Lambek and Dana Scott around 1980);
* locally cartesian closed categories correspond to Martin-Löf type theories (Seely, 1984).

The interplay, known as categorical logic, has been a subject of active research since then; see the monograph of Jacobs (1999) for instance.

==== Homotopy type theory ====
Homotopy type theory attempts to combine type theory and category theory. It focuses on equalities, especially equalities between types. Homotopy type theory differs from intuitionistic type theory mostly by its handling of the equality type. In 2016, cubical type theory was proposed, which is a homotopy type theory with normalization.

==Definitions==
=== Terms and types ===

==== Atomic terms ====
The most basic types are called atoms, and a term whose type is an atom is known as an atomic term. Common atomic terms included in type theories are natural numbers, often notated with the type formula_33, Boolean logic values (formula_15/formula_70), notated with the type formula_31, and formal variables, whose type may vary. For example, the following may be atomic terms.

* formula_72
* formula_73
* formula_74
* formula_75

====Function terms====
In addition to atomic terms, most modern type theories also allow for functions. Function types introduce an arrow symbol, and are defined inductively: If formula_76 and formula_53 are types, then the notation formula_78 is the type of a function which takes a parameter of type formula_76 and returns a term of type formula_53. Types of this form are known as &quot;simple&quot; types.

Some terms may be declared directly as having a simple type, such as the following term, formula_81, which takes in two natural numbers in sequence and returns one natural number.

formula_82

Strictly speaking, a simple type only allows for one input and one output, so a more faithful reading of the above type is that formula_81 is a function which takes in a natural number and returns a function of the form formula_84. The parentheses clarify that formula_81 does not have the type formula_86, which would be a function which takes in a function of natural numbers and returns a natural number. The convention is that the arrow is right associative, so the parentheses may be dropped from formula_81&#x27;s type.

==== Lambda terms ====
New function terms may be constructed using lambda expressions, and are called lambda terms. These terms are also defined inductively: a lambda term has the form formula_88, where formula_89 is a formal variable and formula_2 is a term, and its type is notated formula_78, where formula_76 is the type of formula_89, and formula_53 is the type of formula_2. The following lambda term represents a function which doubles an input natural number.

formula_96

The variable is formula_97 and (implicit from the lambda term&#x27;s type) must have type formula_98. The term formula_99 has type formula_98, which is seen by applying the function application inference rule twice. Thus, the lambda term has type formula_84, which means it is a function taking a natural number as an argument and returning a natural number.

A lambda term is often referred to as an anonymous function because it lacks a name. The concept of anonymous functions appears in many programming languages.

=== Inference Rules ===

==== Function application ====
The power of type theories is in specifying how terms may be combined by way of inference rules. Type theories which have functions also have the inference rule of function application: if formula_2 is a term of type formula_78, and formula_104 is a term of type formula_76, then the application of formula_2 to formula_104, often written formula_108, has type formula_53. For example, if one knows the type notations formula_110, formula_111, and formula_112, then the following type notations can be deduced from function application.
* formula_113
* formula_114
* formula_115

Parentheses indicate the order of operations; however, by convention, function application is left associative, so parentheses can be dropped where appropriate. In the case of the three examples above, all parentheses could be omitted from the first two, and the third may simplified to formula_116.

==== Reductions ====
Type theories that allow for lambda terms also include inference rules known as formula_117-reduction and formula_118-reduction. They generalize the notion of function application to lambda terms. Symbolically, they are written

* formula_119 (formula_117-reduction).
* formula_121, if formula_122 is not a free variable in formula_2 (formula_118-reduction).

The first reduction describes how to evaluate a lambda term: if a lambda expression formula_88 is applied to a term formula_104, one replaces every occurrence of formula_89 in formula_2 with formula_104. The second reduction makes explicit the relationship between lambda expressions and function types: if formula_130 is a lambda term, then it must be that formula_2 is a function term because it is being applied to formula_89. Therefore, the lambda expression is equivalent to just formula_2, as both take in one argument and apply formula_2 to it.

For example, the following term may be formula_117-reduced.

formula_136

In type theories that also establish notions of equality for types and terms, there are corresponding inference rules of formula_117-equality and formula_118-equality.

===Common terms and types===
====Empty type====
The empty type has no terms. The type is usually written formula_139 or formula_140. One use for the empty type is proofs of type inhabitation. If for a type formula_3, it is consistent to derive a function of type formula_142, then formula_3 is &quot;uninhabited&quot;, which is to say it has no terms.

====Unit type====
The unit type has exactly 1 canonical term. The type is written formula_144 or formula_145 and the single canonical term is written formula_146. The unit type is also used in proofs of type inhabitation. If for a type formula_3, it is consistent to derive a function of type formula_148, then formula_3 is &quot;inhabited&quot;, which is to say it must have one or more terms.

====Boolean type====
The Boolean type has exactly 2 canonical terms. The type is usually written formula_150 or formula_151 or formula_152. The canonical terms are usually formula_15 and formula_70.

====Natural numbers====
Natural numbers are usually implemented in the style of Peano Arithmetic. There is a canonical term formula_155 for zero. Canonical values larger than zero use iterated applications of a successor function formula_156.

=== Type constructors ===
Some type theories allow for types of complex terms, such as functions or lists, to depend on the types of its arguments; these are called type constructors. For example, a type theory could have the dependent type formula_157, which should correspond to lists of terms, where each term must have type formula_3. In this case, formula_159 has the kind formula_160, where formula_161 denotes the universe of all types in the theory. 

====Product type====
The product type, formula_162, depends on two types, and its terms are commonly written as ordered pairs formula_163. The pair formula_163 has the product type formula_165, where formula_76 is the type of formula_104 and formula_53 is the type of formula_2. Each product type is then usually defined with eliminator functions formula_170 and formula_171.

* formula_172 returns formula_104, and
* formula_174 returns formula_2.

Besides ordered pairs, this type is used for the concepts of logical conjunction and intersection.

====Sum type====
The sum type is written as either formula_176 or formula_177. In programming languages, sum types may be referred to as tagged unions. Each type formula_178 is usually defined with constructors formula_179 and formula_180, which are injective, and an eliminator function formula_181 such that

* formula_182 returns formula_183, and
* formula_184 returns formula_185.

The sum type is used for the concepts of logical disjunction and union.

=== Polymorphic types ===
Some theories also allow terms to have their definitions depend on types. For instance, an identity function of any type could be written as formula_186. The function is said to be polymorphic in formula_187, or generic in formula_30.

As another example, consider a function formula_189, which takes in a formula_157 and a term of type formula_3, and returns the list with the element at the end. The type annotation of such a function would be formula_192, which can be read as &quot;for any type formula_3, pass in a formula_157 and an formula_3, and return a formula_157&quot;. Here formula_189 is polymorphic in formula_3.

====Products and sums====
With polymorphism, the eliminator functions can be defined generically for &quot;all&quot; product types as formula_199 and formula_200.

* formula_172 returns formula_104, and
* formula_174 returns formula_2.

Likewise, the sum type constructors can be defined for all valid types of sum members as formula_205 and formula_206, which are injective, and the eliminator function can be given as formula_207 such that

* formula_182 returns formula_183, and
* formula_184 returns formula_185.

=== Dependent typing ===
Some theories also permit types to be dependent on terms instead of types. For example, a theory could have the type formula_212, where formula_213 is a term of type formula_33 encoding the length of the vector. This allows for greater specificity and type safety: functions with vector length restrictions or length matching requirements, such as the dot product, can encode this requirement as part of the type. 

There are foundational issues that can arise from dependent types if a theory is not careful about what dependencies are allowed, such as Girard&#x27;s Paradox. The logician Henk Barendegt introduced the lambda cube as a framework for studying various restrictions and levels of dependent typing.

==== Dependent products and sums ====
Two common type dependencies, dependent product and dependent sum types, allow for the theory to encode BHK intuitionistic logic by acting as equivalents to universal and existential quantification; this is formalized by Curry–Howard Correspondence. As they also connect to products and sums in set theory, they are often written with the symbols formula_215 and formula_216, respectively.

Sum types are seen in dependent pairs, where the second type depends on the value of the first term. This arises naturally in computer science where functions may return different types of outputs based on the input. For example, the Boolean type is usually defined with an eliminator function formula_17, which takes three arguments and behaves as follows.
* formula_218 returns formula_30, and
* formula_220 returns formula_32.
Ordinary definitions of formula_17 require formula_30 and formula_32 to have the same type. If the type theory allows for dependent types, then it is possible to define a dependent type formula_225 such that

* formula_226 returns formula_76, and
* formula_228 returns formula_53.

The type of formula_17 may then be written as formula_231.
====Identity type====
Following the notion of Curry-Howard Correspondence, the identity type is a type introduced to mirror propositional equivalence, as opposed to the judgmental (syntactic) equivalence that type theory already provides.

An identity type requires two terms of the same type and is written with the symbol formula_232. For example, if formula_233 and formula_234 are terms, then formula_235 is a possible type. Canonical terms are created with a reflexivity function, formula_236. For a term formula_2, the call formula_238 returns the canonical term inhabiting the type formula_239.

The complexities of equality in type theory make it an active research topic; homotopy type theory is a notable area of research that mainly deals with equality in type theory.

====Inductive types====
Inductive types are a general template for creating a large variety of types. In fact, all the types described above and more can be defined using the rules of inductive types. Two methods of generating inductive types are induction-recursion and induction-induction. A method that only uses lambda terms is Scott encoding.

Some proof assistants, such as Coq and Lean, are based on the calculus for inductive constructions, which is a calculus of constructions with inductive types.

==Differences from set theory==
The most commonly accepted foundation for mathematics is first-order logic with the language and axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice, abbreviated ZFC. Type theories having sufficient expressibility may also act as a foundation of mathematics. There are a number of differences between these two approaches.

* Set theory has both rules and axioms, while type theories only have rules. Type theories, in general, do not have axioms and are defined by their rules of inference.
* Classical set theory and logic have the law of excluded middle. When a type theory encodes the concepts of &quot;and&quot; and &quot;or&quot; as types, it leads to intuitionistic logic, and does not necessarily have the law of excluded middle.
* In set theory, an element is not restricted to one set. The element can appear in subsets and unions with other sets. In type theory, terms (generally) belong to only one type. Where a subset would be used, type theory can use a predicate function or use a dependently-typed product type, where each element formula_30 is paired with a proof that the subset&#x27;s property holds for formula_30. Where a union would be used, type theory uses the sum type, which contains new canonical terms.
* Type theory has a built-in notion of computation. Thus, &quot;1+1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; are different terms in type theory, but they compute to the same value. Moreover, functions are defined computationally as lambda terms. In set theory, &quot;1+1=2&quot; means that &quot;1+1&quot; is just another way to refer the value &quot;2&quot;. Type theory&#x27;s computation does require a complicated concept of equality.
* Set theory encodes numbers as sets. Type theory can encode numbers as functions using Church encoding, or more naturally as inductive types, and the construction closely resembles Peano&#x27;s axioms.
* In type theory, proofs are types whereas in set theory, proofs are part of the underlying first-order logic.

Proponents of type theory will also point out its connection to constructive mathematics through the BHK interpretation, its connection to logic by the Curry–Howard isomorphism, and its connections to Category theory.

===Properties of type theories===
Terms usually belong to a single type. However, there are set theories that define &quot;subtyping&quot;.

Computation takes place by repeated application of rules. Many types of theories are strongly normalizing, which means that any order of applying the rules will always end in the same result. However, some are not. In a normalizing type theory, the one-directional computation rules are called &quot;reduction rules&quot;, and applying the rules &quot;reduces&quot; the term. If a rule is not one-directional, it is called a &quot;conversion rule&quot;.

Some combinations of types are equivalent to other combinations of types. When functions are considered &quot;exponentiation&quot;, the combinations of types can be written similarly to algebraic identities. Thus, formula_242, formula_243, formula_244, formula_245, formula_246.

===Axioms===
Most type theories do not have axioms. This is because a type theory is defined by its rules of inference. This is a source of confusion for people familiar with Set Theory, where a theory is defined by both the rules of inference for a logic (such as first-order logic) and axioms about sets.

Sometimes, a type theory will add a few axioms. An axiom is a judgment that is accepted without a derivation using the rules of inference. They are often added to ensure properties that cannot be added cleanly through the rules.

Axioms can cause problems if they introduce terms without a way to compute on those terms. That is, axioms can interfere with the normalizing property of the type theory.

Some commonly encountered axioms are:
* &quot;Axiom K&quot; ensures &quot;uniqueness of identity proofs&quot;. That is, that every term of an identity type is equal to reflexivity.
* &quot;Univalence Axiom&quot; holds that equivalence of types is equality of types. The research into this property led to cubical type theory, where the property holds without needing an axiom.
* &quot;Law of Excluded Middle&quot; is often added to satisfy users who want classical logic, instead of intuitionistic logic.

The Axiom of Choice does not need to be added to type theory, because in most type theories it can be derived from the rules of inference. This is because of the constructive nature of type theory, where proving that a value exists requires a method to compute the value. The Axiom of Choice is less powerful in type theory than most set theories, because type theory&#x27;s functions must be computable and, being syntax-driven, the number of terms in a type must be countable. (See .)

* some forms of combinatory logic
* others defined in the lambda cube (also known as pure type systems)
* others under the name typed lambda calculus

===Active research===
* Homotopy type theory explores equality of types
* is an implementation of homotopy type theory

==See also==
* Class (set theory)
* Type–token distinction

==Further reading==
* 
* Covers type theory in depth, including polymorphic and dependent type extensions. Gives categorical semantics.
* Provides a historical survey of the developments of the theory of types with a focus on the decline of the theory as a foundation of mathematics over the four decades following the publication of the second edition of &#x27;Principia Mathematica&#x27;.
* Intended as a type theory counterpart of Paul Halmos&#x27;s (1960) &quot;Naïve Set Theory&quot;
* 
* A good introduction to simple type theory for computer scientists; the system described is not exactly Church&#x27;s STT though. Book review 
* 
* Montague, R. (1973) &quot;The proper treatment of quantification in ordinary English&quot;. In K. J. J. Hintikka, J. M. E. Moravcsik, and P. Suppes (eds.), &quot;Approaches to Natural Language&quot; (Synthese Library, 49), Dordrecht: Reidel, 221–242; reprinted in Portner and Partee (eds.) 2002, pp. 17–35.

<doc id="40283" wikidata="Q15318" url="?curid=40283" title="Melting point">
<text>The melting point (or, rarely, liquefaction point) of a substance is the temperature at which it changes state from solid to liquid. At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. The melting point of a substance depends on pressure and is usually specified at a standard pressure such as 1 atmosphere or 100 kPa.

When considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the freezing point or crystallization point. Because of the ability of substances to supercool, the freezing point can easily appear to be below its actual value. When the &quot;characteristic freezing point&quot; of a substance is determined, in fact, the actual methodology is almost always &quot;the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice, that is, the melting point.&quot;

==Examples==

For most substances, melting and freezing points are approximately equal. For example, the melting and freezing points of mercury is . However, certain substances possess differing solid-liquid transition temperatures. For example, agar melts at and solidifies from ; such direction dependence is known as hysteresis. The melting point of ice at 1 atmosphere of pressure is very close to ; this is also known as the ice point. In the presence of nucleating substances, the freezing point of water is not always the same as the melting point. In the absence of nucleators water can exist as a supercooled liquid down to before freezing.

The metal with the highest melting point is tungsten, at ; this property makes tungsten excellent for use as electrical filaments in incandescent lamps. The often-cited carbon does not melt at ambient pressure but sublimes at about ; a liquid phase only exists above pressures of and estimated (see carbon phase diagram). Hafnium carbonitride (HfCN) is a refractory compound with the highest known melting point of any substance to date and the only one confirmed to have a melting point above at ambient pressure. Quantum mechanical computer simulations predicted that this alloy (HfN0.38C0.51) would have a melting point of about 4,400 K. This prediction was later confirmed by experiment, though a precise measurement of its exact melting point has yet to be confirmed. At the other end of the scale, helium does not freeze at all at normal pressure even at temperatures arbitrarily close to absolute zero; a pressure of more than twenty times normal atmospheric pressure is necessary.

==Melting point measurements==
Many laboratory techniques exist for the determination of melting points.
A Kofler bench is a metal strip with a temperature gradient (range from room temperature to 300 °C). Any substance can be placed on a section of the strip, revealing its thermal behaviour at the temperature at that point. Differential scanning calorimetry gives information on melting point together with its enthalpy of fusion.
A basic melting point apparatus for the analysis of crystalline solids consists of an oil bath with a transparent window (most basic design: a Thiele tube) and a simple magnifier. Several grains of a solid are placed in a thin glass tube and partially immersed in the oil bath. The oil bath is heated (and stirred) and with the aid of the magnifier (and external light source) melting of the individual crystals at a certain temperature can be observed. A metal block might be used instead of an oil bath. Some modern instruments have automatic optical detection.

The measurement can also be made continuously with an operating process. For instance, oil refineries measure the freeze point of diesel fuel &quot;online&quot;, meaning that the sample is taken from the process and measured automatically. This allows for more frequent measurements as the sample does not have to be manually collected and taken to a remote laboratory.

===Techniques for refractory materials===
For refractory materials (e.g. platinum, tungsten, tantalum, some carbides and nitrides, etc.) the extremely high melting point (typically considered to be above, say, 1,800 °C) may be determined by heating the material in a black body furnace and measuring the black-body temperature with an optical pyrometer. For the highest melting materials, this may require extrapolation by several hundred degrees. The spectral radiance from an incandescent body is known to be a function of its temperature. An optical pyrometer matches the radiance of a body under study to the radiance of a source that has been previously calibrated as a function of temperature. In this way, the measurement of the absolute magnitude of the intensity of radiation is unnecessary. However, known temperatures must be used to determine the calibration of the pyrometer. For temperatures above the calibration range of the source, an extrapolation technique must be employed. This extrapolation is accomplished by using Planck&#x27;s law of radiation. The constants in this equation are not known with sufficient accuracy, causing errors in the extrapolation to become larger at higher temperatures. However, standard techniques have been developed to perform this extrapolation.

Consider the case of using gold as the source (mp = 1,063 °C). In this technique, the current through the filament of the pyrometer is adjusted until the light intensity of the filament matches that of a black-body at the melting point of gold. This establishes the primary calibration temperature and can be expressed in terms of current through the pyrometer lamp. With the same current setting, the pyrometer is sighted on another black-body at a higher temperature. An absorbing medium of known transmission is inserted between the pyrometer and this black-body. The temperature of the black-body is then adjusted until a match exists between its intensity and that of the pyrometer filament. The true higher temperature of the black-body is then determined from Planck&#x27;s Law. The absorbing medium is then removed and the current through the filament is adjusted to match the filament intensity to that of the black-body. This establishes a second calibration point for the pyrometer. This step is repeated to carry the calibration to higher temperatures. Now, temperatures and their corresponding pyrometer filament currents are known and a curve of temperature versus current can be drawn. This curve can then be extrapolated to very high temperatures.

In determining melting points of a refractory substance by this method, it is necessary to either have black body conditions or to know the emissivity of the material being measured. The containment of the high melting material in the liquid state may introduce experimental difficulties. Melting temperatures of some refractory metals have thus been measured by observing the radiation from a black body cavity in solid metal specimens that were much longer than they were wide. To form such a cavity, a hole is drilled perpendicular to the long axis at the center of a rod of the material. These rods are then heated by passing a very large current through them, and the radiation emitted from the hole is observed with an optical pyrometer. The point of melting is indicated by the darkening of the hole when the liquid phase appears, destroying the black body conditions. Today, containerless laser heating techniques, combined with fast pyrometers and spectro-pyrometers, are employed to allow for precise control of the time for which the sample is kept at extreme temperatures. Such experiments of sub-second duration address several of the challenges associated with more traditional melting point measurements made at very high temperatures, such as sample vaporization and reaction with the container.

==Thermodynamics==

For a solid to melt, heat is required to raise its temperature to the melting point. However, further heat needs to be supplied for the melting to take place: this is called the heat of fusion, and is an example of latent heat.

From a thermodynamics point of view, at the melting point the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of the material is zero, but the enthalpy (&quot;H&quot;) and the entropy (&quot;S&quot;) of the material are increasing (ΔH, ΔS &gt; 0). Melting phenomenon happens when the Gibbs free energy of the liquid becomes lower than the solid for that material. At various pressures this happens at a specific temperature. It can also be shown that:

: formula_1

Here &quot;T&quot;, &quot;ΔS&quot; and &quot;ΔH&quot; are respectively the temperature at the melting point, change of entropy of melting and the change of enthalpy of melting.

The melting point is sensitive to extremely large changes in pressure, but generally this sensitivity is orders of magnitude less than that for the boiling point, because the solid-liquid transition represents only a small change in volume. If, as observed in most cases, a substance is more dense in the solid than in the liquid state, the melting point will increase with increases in pressure. Otherwise the reverse behavior occurs. Notably, this is the case of water, as illustrated graphically to the right, but also of Si, Ge, Ga, Bi. With extremely large changes in pressure, substantial changes to the melting point are observed. For example, the melting point of silicon at ambient pressure (0.1 MPa) is 1415 °C, but at pressures in excess of 10 GPa it decreases to 1000 °C.

Melting points are often used to characterize organic and inorganic compounds and to ascertain their . The melting point of a pure substance is always higher and has a smaller range than the melting point of an impure substance or, more generally, of mixtures. The higher the quantity of other components, the lower the melting point and the broader will be the melting point range, often referred to as the &quot;pasty range&quot;. The temperature at which melting begins for a mixture is known as the &quot;solidus&quot; while the temperature where melting is complete is called the &quot;liquidus&quot;. Eutectics are special types of mixtures that behave like single phases. They melt sharply at a constant temperature to form a liquid of the same composition. Alternatively, on cooling a liquid with the eutectic composition will solidify as uniformly dispersed, small (fine-grained) mixed crystals with the same composition.

In contrast to crystalline solids, glasses do not possess a melting point;
on heating they undergo a smooth glass transition into a viscous liquid.
Upon further heating, they gradually soften, which can be characterized by certain softening points.

==Freezing-point depression==
The freezing point of a solvent is depressed when another compound is added, meaning that a solution has a lower freezing point than a pure solvent. This phenomenon is used in technical applications to avoid freezing, for instance by adding salt or ethylene glycol to water.

==Carnelley&#x27;s rule==
In organic chemistry, Carnelley&#x27;s rule, established in 1882 by Thomas Carnelley, states that &quot;high molecular symmetry is associated with high melting point&quot;. Carnelley based his rule on examination of 15,000 chemical compounds. For example, for three structural isomers with molecular formula C5H12 the melting point increases in the series isopentane −160 °C (113 K) n-pentane −129.8 °C (143 K) and neopentane −16.4 °C (256.8 K). Likewise in xylenes and also dichlorobenzenes the melting point increases in the order meta, ortho and then para. Pyridine has a lower symmetry than benzene hence its lower melting point but the melting point again increases with diazine and triazines. Many cage-like compounds like adamantane and cubane with high symmetry have relatively high melting points.

A high melting point results from a high heat of fusion, a low entropy of fusion, or a combination of both. In highly symmetrical molecules the crystal phase is densely packed with many efficient intermolecular interactions resulting in a higher enthalpy change on melting.
==Predicting the melting point of substances (Lindemann&#x27;s criterion)==
An attempt to predict the bulk melting point of crystalline materials was first made in 1910 by Frederick Lindemann. The idea behind the theory was the observation that the average amplitude of thermal vibrations increases with increasing temperature. Melting initiates when the amplitude of vibration becomes large enough for adjacent atoms to partly occupy the same space. The Lindemann criterion states that melting is expected when the vibration root mean square amplitude exceeds a threshold value.

Assuming that all atoms in a crystal vibrate with the same frequency &quot;ν&quot;, the average thermal energy can be estimated using the equipartition theorem as
:formula_2
where &quot;m&quot; is the atomic mass, &quot;ν&quot; is the frequency, &quot;u&quot; is the average vibration amplitude, &quot;k&quot;B is the Boltzmann constant, and &quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature. If the threshold value of &quot;u2&quot; is &quot;c2a2&quot; where &quot;c&quot; is the Lindemann constant and &quot;a&quot; is the atomic spacing, then the melting point is estimated as
:formula_3
Several other expressions for the estimated melting temperature can be obtained depending on the estimate of the average thermal energy. Another commonly used expression for the Lindemann criterion is
:formula_4
From the expression for the Debye frequency for &quot;ν&quot;,
:formula_5
where &quot;θ&quot;D is the Debye temperature and &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant. Values of &quot;c&quot; range from 0.15 to 0.3 for most materials.

=== Databases and automated prediction ===
In February 2011, Alfa Aesar released over 10,000 melting points of compounds from their catalog as open data and similar data has been mined from patents. The Alfa Aesar and patent data have been summarized in (respectively) random forest and support vector machines.

<doc id="40284" wikidata="Q495933" url="?curid=40284" title="Cam (mechanism)">
<text>A cam is a rotating or sliding piece in a mechanical linkage used especially in transforming rotary motion into linear motion. It is often a part of a rotating wheel (e.g. an eccentric wheel) or shaft (e.g. a cylinder with an irregular shape) that strikes a lever at one or more points on its circular path. The cam can be a simple tooth, as is used to deliver pulses of power to a steam hammer, for example, or an eccentric disc or other shape that produces a smooth reciprocating (back and forth) motion in the &quot;follower&quot;, which is a lever making contact with the cam. A cam timer is similar, and these were widely used for electric machine control (an electromechanical timer in a washing machine being a common example) before the advent of inexpensive electronics, microcontrollers, integrated circuits, programmable logic controllers and digital control.

== Camshaft ==
The cam can be seen as a device that converts rotational motion to reciprocating (or sometimes oscillating) motion. A common example is the camshaft of an automobile, which takes the rotary motion of the engine and converts it into the reciprocating motion necessary to operate the intake and exhaust valves of the cylinders.

== Displacement diagram ==

Cams can be characterized by their displacement diagrams, which reflect the changing position a follower would make as the surface of the cam moves in contact with the follower. In the example shown, the cam rotates about an axis. These diagrams relate angular position, usually in degrees, to the radial displacement experienced at that position. Displacement diagrams are traditionally presented as graphs with non-negative values. A simple displacement diagram illustrates the follower motion at a constant velocity rise followed by a similar return with a dwell in between as depicted in figure 2. The rise is the motion of the follower away from the cam center, dwell is the motion where the follower is at rest, and return is the motion of the follower toward the cam center.

A common type is in the valve actuators in internal combustion engines. Here, the cam profile is commonly symmetric and at rotational speeds generally met with, very high acceleration forces develop. Ideally, a convex curve between the onset and maximum position of lift reduces acceleration, but this requires impractically large shaft diameters relative to lift. Thus, in practice, the points at which lift begins and ends mean that a tangent to the base circle appears on the profile. This is continuous with a tangent to the tip circle. In designing the cam, the lift and the dwell angle are given. If the profile is treated as a large base circle and a small tip circle, joined by a common tangent, giving lift , the relationship can be calculated, given the angle between one tangent and the axis of symmetry ( being ), while is the distance between the centres of the circles (required), and is the radius of the base (given) and that of the tip circle (required):

: and 

==Disc or plate cam ==
The most commonly used cam is the cam plate (also known as &quot;disc cam&quot; or &quot;radial cam&quot;)
which is cut out of a piece of flat metal or plate. Here, the follower moves in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the camshaft. Several key terms are relevant in such a construction of plate cams: base circle, prime circle (with radius equal to the sum of the follower radius and the base circle radius), pitch curve which is the radial curve traced out by applying the radial displacements away from the prime circle across all angles, and the lobe separation angle (LSA – the angle between two adjacent intake and exhaust cam lobes).

The base circle is the smallest circle that can be drawn to the cam profile.

A once common, but now outdated, application of this type of cam was automatic machine tool programming cams. Each tool movement or operation was controlled directly by one or more cams. Instructions for producing programming cams and cam generation data for the most common makes of machine, were included in engineering references well into the modern CNC era.

This type of cam is used in many simple electromechanical appliances controllers, such as dishwashers and clothes washing machines, to actuate mechanical switches that control the various parts.
==Cylindrical cam==

A cylindrical cam, or barrel cam, is a cam in which the follower rides on the surface of a cylinder. In the most common type, the follower rides in a groove cut into the surface of a cylinder. These cams are principally used to convert rotational motion to linear motion perpendicular to the rotational axis of the cylinder. A cylinder may have several grooves cut into the surface and drive several followers. Cylindrical cams can provide motions that involve more than a single rotation of the cylinder and generally provide positive positioning, removing the need for a spring or other provision to keep the follower in contact with the control surface.

Applications include machine tool drives, such as reciprocating saws, and shift control barrels in sequential transmissions, such as on most modern motorcycles.

A special case of this cam is a constant lead, where the position of the follower is linear with rotation, as in a lead screw. The purpose and detail of implementation influence whether this application is called a cam or a screw thread, but in some cases, the nomenclature may be ambiguous.

Cylindrical cams may also be used to reference an output to two inputs, where one input is the rotation of the cylinder and the other is the position of the follower along the cam. The output is radial to the cylinder. These were once common for special functions in control systems, such as fire control mechanisms for guns on naval vessels and mechanical analog computers.

An example of a cylindrical cam with two inputs is provided by a duplicating lathe, an example of which is the Klotz axe handle lathe, which cuts an axe handle to a form controlled by a pattern acting as a cam for the lathe mechanism.

== Face cam ==
A face cam produces motion by using a follower riding on the face of a disk. The most common type has the follower ride in a slot so that the captive follower produces radial motion with positive positioning without the need for a spring or other mechanism to keep the follower in contact with the control surface. A face cam of this type generally has only one slot for a follower on each face. In some applications, a single element, such as a gear, a barrel cam or other rotating element with a flat face, may do duty as a face cam in addition to other purposes.

Face cams may provide repetitive motion with a groove that forms a closed curve or may provide function generation with a stopped groove. Cams used for function generation may have grooves that require several revolutions to cover the complete function, and in this case, the function generally needs to be invertible so that the groove does not self intersect, and the function output value must differ enough at corresponding rotations that there is sufficient material separating the adjacent groove segments. A common form is the constant lead cam, where the displacement of the follower is linear with rotation, such as the scroll plate in a scroll chuck. Non-invertible functions, which require the groove to self-intersect, can be implemented using special follower designs.
A variant of the face cam provides motion parallel to the axis of cam rotation. A common example is the traditional sash window lock, where the cam is mounted to the top of the lower sash, and the follower is the hook on the upper sash. In this application, the cam is used to provide a mechanical advantage in forcing the window shut, and also provides a self-locking action, like some worm gears, due to friction.

Face cams may also be used to reference a single output to two inputs, typically where one input is the rotation of the cam and the other is the radial position of the follower. The output is parallel to the axis of the cam. These were once common is mechanical analog computation and special functions in control systems.

A face cam that implements three outputs for a single rotational input is the stereo phonograph, where a relatively constant lead groove guides the stylus and tonearm unit, acting as either a rocker-type (tonearm) or linear (linear tracking turntable) follower, and the stylus alone acting as the follower for two orthogonal outputs to representing the audio signals. These motions are in a plane radial to the rotation of the record and at angles of 45 degrees to the plane of the disk (normal to the groove faces). The position of the tonearm was used by some turntables as a control input, such as to turn the unit off or to load the next disk in a stack, but was ignored in simple units.

==Heart shaped cam==
This type of cam, in the form of a symmetric heart, is used to return a shaft holding the cam to a set position by pressure from a roller. They were used on early models of Post Office Master clocks to synchronise the clock time with Greenwich Mean Time when the activating follower was pressed onto the cam automatically via a signal from an accurate time source.

==Snail drop cam==
This type of cam was used for example in mechanical timekeeping clocking-in clocks to drive the day advance mechanism at precisely midnight and consisted of a follower being raised over 24 hours by the cam in a spiral path which terminated at a sharp cut off at which the follower would drop down and activate the day advance. Where timing accuracy is required as in clocking-in clocks these were typically ingeniously arranged to have a roller cam follower to raise the drop weight for most of its journey to near its full height, and only for the last portion of its travel for the weight to be taken over and supported by a solid follower with a sharp edge. This ensured that the weight dropped at a precise moment, enabling accurate timing. This was achieved by the use of two snail cams mounted coaxially with the roller initially resting on one cam and the final solid follower on the other but not in contact with its cam profile. Thus the roller cam initially carried the weight, until at the final portion of the run the profile of the non-roller cam rose more than the other causing the solid follower to take the weight.

== Linear cam ==
A linear cam is one in which the cam element moves in a straight line rather than rotates. The cam element is often a plate or block but may be any cross-section. The key feature is that the input is a linear motion rather than rotational. The cam profile may be cut into one or more edges of a plate or block, may be one or more slots or grooves in the face of an element, or may even be a surface profile for a cam with more than one input. The development of a linear cam is similar to, but not identical to, that of a rotating cam.
A common example of a linear cam is a key for a pin tumbler lock. The pins act as followers. This behavior is exemplified when the key is duplicated in a key duplication machine, where the original key acts as a control cam for cutting the new key.

==History==
Cam mechanisms appeared in China at around 600 BC in the form of a crossbow trigger-mechanism with a cam-shaped swing arm. However, the trigger mechanism did not rotate around its own axis and traditional Chinese technology generally made little use of continuously rotating cams. Nevertheless, later research showed that such cam mechanisms did in fact rotate around its own axis. Likewise, more recent research indicates that cams were used in water-driven trip hammers by the latter half of the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC – 8 AD) as recorded in the Huan Zi Xin Lun. Complex pestles were also mentioned in later records such as the Jin Zhu Gong Zan and the Tian Gong Kai Wu, amongst many other records of water-driven pestles. During the Tang dynasty, the wooden clock within the water-driven astronoical device, the spurs inside a water-driven armillary sphere, the automated alarm within a five-wheeled sand-driven clock, artificial paper figurines within a revolving lantern, all utilized cam mechanisms. The Chinese hodometer which utilized a bell and gong mechanism is also a cam, as described in the Song Shi. In the book Nongshu, the vertical wheel of a water-driven wind box is also a cam. Out of these examples, the water-driven pestle and the water driven wind box both have two cam mechanisms inside. Cams that rotated continuously and functioned as integral machine elements were built into Hellenistic water-driven automata from the 3rd century BC.

The cam and camshaft later appeared in mechanisms by Al-Jazari, who used them in his automata, described in 1206. The cam and camshaft appeared in European mechanisms from the 14th century. Waldo J Kelleigh of Electrical Apparatus Company patented the adjustable cam in the United States in 1956 for its use in mechanical engineering and weaponry.

<text>William Butler Ogden (June 15, 1805 – August 3, 1877) was an American politician and railroad executive who served as the first Mayor of Chicago. He was referred to as &quot;the Astor of Chicago.&quot; He was, at one time, the city&#x27;s richest citizen.
He brought the Galena &amp; Chicago Union RR out of insolvency and was its first president in 1847.
He created the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway from the failed remains of the Chicago, St.Paul, Fond du Lac and was its first president in 1859.
He spearheaded the 1st transcontinental railroad as the Union Pacific and was its first president in 1862 [although he relinquished that position due to health.]

==Early life==
Ogden was born on June 15, 1805, in Walton, New York. He was the son of Abraham Ogden (1771–1825) and Abigail (née Weed) Ogden (1788–1850).

When still a teenager, his father died and Ogden took over the family real estate business. He assisted Charles Butler, his brother-in-law, with business matters related to opening a new building for New York University, attending the law school for a brief period himself.

The first political position Ogden held was as Postmaster of Walton, New York, having been appointed by President Andrew Jackson to the position.

He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Delaware Co.) in 1835.

During his career in New York politics, Ogden was a Jacksonian Democrat. However, Ogden was also an advocate of government funding for infrastructural improvements, aspiring to see the federal government financially back the construction of a railroad from New York to Chicago. He told colleagues that such a railroad would be &quot;the most splendid system of internal communication ever yet devised by man.&quot; He had been elected to the New York Senate on a platform supporting state funding for the construction of the New York and Erie Railroad. The bill he backed to accomplish this was passed.

One of Ogden&#x27;s brothers-in-law purchased a tract of land in Chicago for $100,000 in 1834. Ogden went to survey this area in 1835, and wrote back that his relative had &quot;been guilty of the grossest folly&quot; as the land held no value due to being boggy and swampy. However, he sold 1/3 of the land for more than the entire tract been purchased for after the muddy environment dried up in summer. Ogden chose to stay in Chicago rather than return to New York.

While Ogden&#x27;s initial concern in Chicago was based in his land interests there, he believed that he could not afford to stay out of the politics of the city, as he believed growing western towns such as Chicago were dependent on government assistance.

Shortly after moving to Chicago in 1836, Ogden joined the committee responsible for drafting the city charter to be submitted to the state legislature.

In 1837, he was elected the first mayor of Chicago, serving a single one-year term. From 1840 through 1841, he served on the Chicago Common Council as an alderman from the 6th Ward. From 1847 through 1848, he served as an alderman from the 9th Ward.

Ogden was a booster of Chicago both during and after his tenures in elected office. At the time he came to Chicago, its buildings were largely wood cabins, it lacked sidewalks and decent bridges, it had no paved roads, and it lacked water supply infrastructure. As a politician he advocated for the city to raise tax revenue for new roads, plank sidewalks, and bridges (which he presented designs of his own for). He also used his own wealth to fund improvements to the city&#x27;s infrastructure.

===Railroad career===
Ogden was a leading promoter and investor in the Illinois and Michigan Canal, then switched his loyalty to railroads. Throughout his later life, Ogden was heavily involved in the building of several railroads. 
&quot;In 1847, Ogden announced a plan to build a railway out of Chicago, but no capital was forthcoming. Eastern investors were wary of Chicago&#x27;s reputation for irrational boosterism, and Chicagoans did not want to divert traffic from their profitable canal works. So Ogden and his partner J. Young Scammon solicited subscriptions from the farmers and small businessmen whose land lay adjacent to the proposed rail. Farmer&#x27;s wives used the money they earned from selling eggs to buy shares of stock on a monthly payment plan. By 1848, Ogden and Scammon had raised $350,000—enough to begin laying track. The Galena and Chicago Union Railroad was profitable from the start and eventually extended out to Wisconsin, bringing grain from the Great Plains into the city. As president of Union Pacific, Ogden extended the reach of Chicago&#x27;s rail lines to the West coast.&quot;

In 1853, the Chicago Land Company, of which Ogden was a trustee, purchased land at a bend in the Chicago River and began to cut a channel, formally known as North Branch Canal, but also referred to as Ogden&#x27;s Canal. The resulting island is now known as Goose Island.

In 1857, Ogden created the Chicago Dock and Canal Company. Ogden designed the first swing bridge in Chicago and donated the land for Rush Medical Center. Ogden was also a founder of the Chicago Board of Trade.

Ogden served on the board of the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad and lobbied with many others for congressional approval and funding of the transcontinental railroad. After the 1862 Pacific Railroad Act, Ogden was named as the first president of the Union Pacific Railroad. Ogden was a good choice for the first president, but his railroad experience was most likely not the primary reason he was chosen; Ogden was a clever man who had many political connections. When Ogden came to lead the Union Pacific, the railroad was not fully funded and had not yet laid a single mile of track. The railroad existed largely on paper created by an act of Congress. As part of the 1862 Pacific Railroad Act, Congress named several existing railroad companies to complete portions of the project. Several key areas needed to link the East (Chicago) to the West had none, and hence the Union Pacific was formed by Congress.

During the early days of railroading Ogden had begun building Northwestern railroads connecting Chicago with cities like Janesville, Fond du Lac and St. Paul/St. Anthony. In 1856 this was the Chicago, St. Anthony and Fond du Lac Railroad but the financial panic beginning in 1857 caused the collapse of this project. Fortunately Ogden&#x27;s long time personal reputation and character helped him get many supporters putting together resources to reorganize as the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway the following year of which he was president from 1859 to 1868. 

While his failing health precluded as active a participation as in his earlier years, his Vice President, Perry Smith and Supt. George L Dunlap carried over from the Fond du Lac era, kept things progressing until 1864 when a Grand Consolidation took place with the Galena &amp; Chicago Union Railroad. This new C&amp;NW was able to cross Iowa to the Missouri River at Council Bluffs and join with Ogden&#x27;s other project, the Union Pacific Transcontinental railroad in Omaha. By 1867 he could see his beloved Chicago connected by rail with California.

Ogden was a fierce supporter of the transcontinental railroad at a time of great unrest for the country and was quoted as saying:

This project must be carried through by even-handed wise consideration and a patriotic course of policy which shall inspire capitalists of the country with confidence. Speculation is as fatal to it as secession is to the Union. Whoever speculates will damn this project.

As history now shows, eventually Ogden and many others got their wish.

===Later life===
On October 8, 1871, Ogden lost most of his prized possessions in the Great Chicago Fire. He also owned a lumber company in Peshtigo, Wisconsin, which burned the same day.

==Personal life==

He married Marianna Tuttle Arnot (1825–1904). Marianna was the daughter of Scottish born John Arnot and Harriet (née Tuttle) Arnot. In New York, he named his home in the Highbridge, Bronx (named after the bridge now called Aqueduct Bridge over the Harlem River connecting Manhattan and the Bronx) Villa Boscobel.

Ogden died at his home in the Bronx on Friday, August 3, 1877. The funeral was held August 6, 1877, with several prominent pallbearers including, Gouverneur Morris III, William A. Booth, Parke Godwin, Oswald Ottendorfer, William C. Sheldon, Martin Zborowski, and Andrew H. Green. He was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx.

Ogden, who had no children, left behind an estate valued at $10 million in 1877. Some of the money was used to fund a graduate school of science at the Old University of Chicago. Much was left to his niece Eleanor Wheeler, who married Alexander C. McClurg.

===Legacy===
Namesakes of William B. Ogden include a stretch of U.S. Highway 34, called Ogden Avenue in Chicago and its suburbs, Ogden International School of Chicago, which is located on Walton Street in Chicago, and Ogden Slip, a man-made harbor near the mouth of the Chicago River. Ogden Avenue in The Bronx is also named after him, as is Ogden, Iowa. The Arnot-Odgen Memorial Hospital, founded by his wife Mariana, also bears his namesake. Following his death, William B. Ogden left money to his hometown of Walton, New York, which was used for the construction of a library, completed in 1897, which bears his name, the William B. Ogden Free Library, and is still in use today.

<text>John Wentworth (March 5, 1815 – October 16, 1888), nicknamed Long John, was the editor of the &quot;Chicago Democrat,&quot; publisher of an extensive Wentworth family genealogy, a two-term mayor of Chicago, and a six-term member of the United States House of Representatives (serving tenured in that body both before and after his service as mayor).

After growing up in New Hampshire, he joined the migration west and moved to the developing city of Chicago in 1836, where he made his adult life. Wentworth was affiliated with the Democratic Party until 1855; then he changed to the Republican Party. After retiring from politics, he wrote a three-volume genealogy of the Wentworth family in the United States.

==Early life and education==
John Wentworth was born in Sandwich, New Hampshire. He was educated at the New Hampton Literary Institute and at the academy of Dudley Leavitt. Known as &quot;Long John&quot; he was 6 foot 6 inches in height. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1836.

==Migration west and career==
Later that year, Wentworth joined a migration west and moved to Chicago, arriving in the city on October 25, 1836. He became managing editor of Chicago&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Chicago Democrat,&quot; eventually becoming its owner and publisher. He owned the paper for 25 years.

Wentworth was admitted to the bar in 1841.

He started a law practice and entered politics. He was a business partner of Illinois financier Jacob Bunn, and the two men were two of the incorporators of the Chicago Secure Depository Company.

==Marriage and family==
In 1844, he married Roxanna Marie Loomis. 

In later years, his nephew Moses J. Wentworth handled his business affairs, and would eventually manage his estate as well.

==Political career==

Wentworth served two separate one-year terms as mayor of Chicago (1857–1858 and 1860–1861) as well as three separate stints in the United States House of Representatives totaling six terms (1843–1851; 1853–1855; 1865–1867). The first five of his congressional terms were as a Democrat, while the final was as a Republican. His first mayoral term was as a Republican, while his second was as a Democrat.

===Early political career===
Wentworth started his political involvement as a Jacksonian democrat, and promoted these views in the &quot;Chicago Democrat&quot;. After he supported the 1837 mayoral candidacy of William Ogden, including throwing the newspaper behind Ogden&#x27;s candidacy, he was appointed by Odgen to serve in the post of city printer.

===U.S. Congressman from Illinois&#x27;s 4th district (1843–1851)===
Wentworth, having become active in Democratic politics, was elected in 1842 to represent Illinois&#x27;s 4th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. He took office in March 1843. He was re-elected in 1844, 1846, and1848.

===U.S. Congressman from Illinois&#x27;s 2nd district (1853–1855)===
Wentworth returned to the U.S. House of Representatives in March 1853, having been elected in 1852 to represent Illinois&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. He did not run for re-election 1854, and left office in March 1855.

According to city historians in Sandwich, Illinois, Wentworth was one of the key individuals who was responsible for the city getting a railroad stop. The town, which at the time, was called &quot;Newark Station&quot;, was given the station, and in turn, the town gave Wentworth the honor of naming the town, which he subsequently named after his hometown, Sandwich, New Hampshire. It is also to note that the boundary line dispute with Wisconsin would have cut through present-day Sandwich, as it straddles the northern border with neighboring LaSalle County, which would have been the State Line had Wentworth not been successful in moving the line north

===Chicago mayoralties (1857–1858; 1860–1861)===
Wentworth returned to Chicago and affiliated with the Republican Party. Running as a Republican, he elected the mayor of Chicago in 1857. He served two terms, 1857–1858 and 1860–1861 (being elected to his second term in the 1860 Chicago mayoral election). In his second term, he again affiliated with the Democratic Party.

As mayor Wentworth instituted the use of chain gangs of prisoners in the city as laborers.

In July 1857, while serving as mayor of Chicago, Wentworth was charged with assaulting an attorney named Charles Cameron, who was attempting to communicate with his incarcerated client. Cameron testified that Wentworth &quot;seized him by the coat collar and shirt bosom&quot; and forcibly removed him from the prison, alleging that he had resisted officers. Wentworth, after requesting the case be delayed twice, refused to appear in court. The Judge found in favor of Cameron and charged Wentworth amounts of $25 &quot;and costs&quot; of $200.
In his effort to clean up the city&#x27;s morals, he hired spies to determine who was frequenting Chicago&#x27;s brothels. In 1857, Wentworth led a raid on &quot;the Sands,&quot; Chicago&#x27;s red-light district, which resulted in the burning of the area.

In 1862, many of the city&#x27;s Republicans had hoped to nominate him as the Republican nominee for mayor, but Charles N. Holden successfully defeated these efforts and secured the nomination for himself.

===U.S. Congressman from Illinois&#x27;s 1st district (1865–1867)===
In 1864, Wentworth ran for Congress as a Republican, and was elected for his last term (serving March 4, 1865March 3, 1867) representing Illinois&#x27;s 1st congressional district. While he was in the House, there was a controversial vote to settle a boundary issue between Wisconsin and Illinois, with Wisconsin claiming land as far as the tip of Lake Michigan. Wentworth was promised that if he voted to give the land including Chicago to Wisconsin, he would be appointed to the US Senate. Wentworth declined the offer.

===Chicago Board of Education (1860–1863; 1867–1871)=== 
From 1860 until 1863, Wentworth served on the Chicago Board of Education. Wentworth again served on the Chicago Board of Education from 1867 until 1871. Per some sources, he was board president in 1869, while other sources name S.A. Briggs as having held the office that year instead.

==Later life==
After retiring from Congress, beginning in 1868 Wentworth lived at his country estate at 5441 South Harlem Avenue in Chicago. He owned about of land in what is today part of the Chicago neighborhood of Garfield Ridge and suburban Summit.

When an author left a manuscript of a history of Chicago with Wentworth for his suggestions, he reportedly removed what did not refer to him and returned the manuscript to its author with the note, &quot;Here is your expurgated and correct history of Chicago.&quot;

==Family historian==
Wentworth researched and wrote &quot;The Wentworth Genealogy – English and American&quot; twice, which he published privately. The first two-volume edition, also known as the &quot;private edition&quot;, published in 1871, was followed by a second, corrected, edition in 1878, which was published in three volumes, for a total of 2241 pages. The total reported cost for both editions was $40,000. The first of the 1878 volumes chronicles the ancestry of Elder William Wentworth, the first of this family in New England, and his first five generations of New World descendants. The second and third volumes discuss the &quot;Elder&#x27;s&quot; many descendants and others of the name. John was a fourth great-grandson of William.

==Death==
Wentworth died at his estate in 1888, aged 73. He was buried in Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago.
At his request, his tombstone was a sixty-foot tall granite obelisk that was imported from New Hampshire on two railroad cars. It was, at the time, the tallest tombstone in the west.

<text>Hiram College ( ) is a private liberal arts college in Hiram, Ohio, United States. It was founded in 1850 as the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute by Amos Sutton Hayden and other members of the Disciples of Christ Church. The college is nonsectarian and coeducational. It is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Among its alumni is James A. Garfield, who also served as a college instructor and principal before he was President of the United States.

==History==
On June 12, 1849, representatives of the Disciples of Christ voted to establish an academic institution, which would later become Hiram College. On November 7 that year, they chose the village of Hiram as the site for the school because the founders considered this area of the Western Reserve to be &quot;healthful and free of distractions&quot;. The following month, on December 20, the founders accepted the suggestion of Isaac Errett and named the school the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute.

The institute&#x27;s original charter was authorized by the state legislature on March 1, 1850, and the school opened several months later, on November 27. Many of the students came from the surrounding farms and villages of the Western Reserve, but Hiram soon gained a national reputation and students began arriving from other states. On February 20, 1867, the Institute incorporated as a college and changed its name to Hiram College.

During the years before it was renamed Hiram College, 1850–1867, the school had seven principals, the equivalent of today&#x27;s college presidents. The two that did the most in establishing and defining the nature of the institution were Disciple minister Amos Sutton Hayden, who led the school through its first six years, and James A. Garfield, who had been a student at the institute from 1851 to 1853 and then returned in 1856 as a teacher. As principal, Garfield expanded the institute&#x27;s curriculum. He left the Institute in 1861 and in 1880 was elected the 20th President of the United States.

In 1870, one of Garfield&#x27;s best friends and former students, Burke A. Hinsdale, was appointed Hiram&#x27;s president. Although there were two before him, Hinsdale is considered the college&#x27;s first permanent president because the others served only briefly. The next president to have a major impact on the college was Ely V. Zollars, who increased enrollment significantly, established a substantial endowment and created a program for the construction of campus buildings. Later presidents who served for at least 10 years were Miner Lee Bates, Kenneth I. Brown, Paul H. Fall, Elmer Jagow, and G. Benjamin Oliver.

In 1931, shortly before Hiram celebrated the 100th anniversary of Garfield&#x27;s birth, there was a debate in the community about changing the name of the school to Garfield College. There were strong advocates on both sides of the issue. Among the 2,000 guests at the centennial celebration were three generations of Garfield&#x27;s family, including two of his sons. The idea of changing the college&#x27;s name was not mentioned at the event and the idea was abandoned.

=== James H. Barrow Field Station ===
In 1967, Paul and Maxine Frohring donated their recently acquired 75 acres of land in Garrettsville to Hiram College to promote wildlife research. James H. Barrow, a biology professor at the college, founded the Hiram Biological Station on the land, causing the place to later be named in his honor in 1985. Originally, the property had a beech-maple forest, a stream and a bog, but over the years it grew into over 500 acres containing forests, fields, ponds, wetlands, and more. The Frohring Forest–150 acres of mature beech-maple trees–Silver Creek, Eagle Creek, and the Observation Pond–which has many waterfowl species, along with a pair of trumpeter swans–are some of the Field Stations’ most well-known natural attractions. The property also contains multiple public hiking trails, and eleven facilities for different uses such as teaching, housing animals, research, and so on. Two of the most notable buildings are the Frohring Laboratory, which uses geothermal heating and cooling and was the first LEED certified building at Hiram, and also houses a miniature indoor aquarium with different breeds of fish, amphibians, reptiles, and occasionally mammals. The other is the Endangered Waterfowl Conservation Facility, which houses multiple different breeds of endangered birds and allows students to gain valuable hands-on experience. 

A unique program established by the Field Station is the Grassland Program. Beginning in 2011, Land Stewardship Manager Emliss Ricks has been working on establishing grasslands in three locations on the property. The first location is a one-acre prairie to maintain the natural plant diversity, and it was established by the late botany professor Matt Hils. The second location is twenty acres, and the main objective here is to protect Silver Creek’s watershed, increase plant diversity, and provide a habitat for diverse species. The third location is three acres and is located by State Route 82 to act as a display for those passing by.

==Academics==
As of the 2019–20 academic year, Hiram&#x27;s student body consists of 1,116 undergraduates from 27 states and 11 foreign countries. Of the 81 full–time faculty, 95% hold a Ph.D. or other terminal degree in their field.

Hiram specializes in the education of undergraduate students, though the college does have a small graduate program. Hiram confers the BA, BSN, and MA degrees. The college offers 33 majors and 40 minors for traditional undergraduates, in addition to pre-professional programs for specific fields. Interdisciplinary studies have also been a part of Hiram&#x27;s curriculum for decades.

Hiram&#x27;s curriculum requires all students to complete one course in each of nine academic areas: creative methods, interpretive methods, modeling methods, experimental scientific methods, social and cultural analysis, experiencing the world, understanding diversity at home, interdisciplinary, and ethics and social responsibility. Its education plan also includes international study and independent study opportunities, and faculty–guided research projects. Currently, almost all majors require some form of extensive independent project or apprenticeship experience.

Hiram&#x27;s academic program consists of five schools: Arts, Humantities &amp; Culture; Business &amp; Communication; Education, Civil Leadership &amp; Social Change; Health &amp; Medical Humanities; and Science &amp; Technology.

The college&#x27;s curriculum is currently marketed under the name Hiram Connect, which involves four steps: First Year Colloquium/Foundations of the Liberal Arts, Declaration of Major, Experiential Learning, and a Capstone Project.

Hiram has five &quot;Centers of Distinction&quot; for interdisciplinary studies: Center for Integrated Entrepreneurship, Center for Scientific Engagement, Center for Literature and Medicine, Garfield Institute for Public Leadership, and Lindsay-Crane Center for Writing and Literature.

===Reputation and rankings===
Hiram was ranked #167 among National Liberal Arts Colleges by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in 2012. At the same time, Hiram is currently ranked #67 among Liberal Arts Colleges by &quot;Washington Monthly&quot;. Also, in 2018, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Hiram at #644 among all colleges and universities in the U.S, and #29 in Ohio. Hiram has regularly been included in &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; Best Colleges guide, and is one of 40 schools included in Loren Pope&#x27;s book &quot;Colleges That Change Lives&quot;.

Hiram is a member of the Annapolis Group, which has been critical of the college rankings process. Hiram is among the signatories of the &quot;Presidents Letter&quot;.

==Student life==
===Athletics===

The school&#x27;s sports teams are called the Terriers. They participate in NCAA Division III and the North Coast Athletic Conference. In men&#x27;s volleyball and men&#x27;s wrestling, sports not sponsored by the NCAC, Hiram competes in the Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference. Stunt, an all-female cheerleading discipline included in the NCAA Emerging Sports for Women program, competes in the Great Midwest Athletic Conference.

Hiram will join the Presidents&#x27; Athletic Conference (PAC) for administrative purposes on July 1, 2024, coinciding with its move to that conference as a men&#x27;s volleyball associate. It will continue to compete in other NCAC sports through the 2024–25 school year before fully joining the PAC. Hiram had been a full PAC member from 1971 to 1989.

The Hiram College basketball team won the gold medal in the collegiate division of the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis. It was the first time that basketball was part of an Olympics; it was included as a demonstration sport and no foreign teams participated.

The Cleveland Browns held their training camp at Hiram College from 1952 through 1974, making it the longest–tenured training site in the team&#x27;s history.

The 2014 Hiram vs. Mount St. Joseph women&#x27;s basketball game was named the Best Moment at the 2015 ESPY Awards. The game featured terminally ill Mount St. Joseph player Lauren Hill in the first of her four college games, which set the all-time attendance record for an NCAA women&#x27;s game below the Division I level.

===Residence life===
The college&#x27;s residential complexes include Booth-Centennial, East Hall, Whitcomb Hall, Miller Hall, Bowler Hall, and the Townhouses.

===Student clubs and organizations===
Student Senate is the elected student governing body of the college. It serves as a liaison between students and the school&#x27;s administration, and oversees all student clubs and organizations, collectively called the Associated Student Organizations (ASO). The Kennedy Center Programming Board (KCPB) falls under the auspices of Student Senate, and is responsible for planning educational, social, recreational, and cultural programs.

Hiram has close to 70 registered student clubs and organizations in eight categories: Academic, Greek Social, Musical, Political and Activism, Publications and Communications, Religious, Special Interest and Service, and Sports and Recreation. Fraternities and sororities are not permitted on campus, but there are six Greek social clubs: Delta Chi Lambda, Kappa Sigma Pi, Lambda Lambda Lambda, Phi Beta Gamma, Phi Gamma Epsilon, Phi Kappa Chi, and Greek Social.

Since 1971, Hiram has maintained a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the national honor society for the liberal arts. The school has also had a chapter of Omicron Delta Kappa (ODK), a national leadership honor society, since 1962.

<doc id="40290" wikidata="Q295275" url="?curid=40290" title="Joseph Medill">
<text>Joseph Medill (April 6, 1823 – March 16, 1899) was a Canadian-American newspaper editor, publisher, and Republican Party politician. He was co-owner and managing editor of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and he was Mayor of Chicago from after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 until 1873.

==Early life==
Joseph Medill was born April 6, 1823, in Saint John, New Brunswick, British North America, to Margaret and William Medill. His parents were Scots-Irish. In 1832, the family moved to Massillon, Ohio. He grew up on a farm and was taught English grammar, Latin, logic and philosophy from Reverend Hawkins, a clergyman of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Canton. He graduated from the Massillon Academy in 1843. He read law under Hiram Griswold and was admitted to the Ohio Bar in 1846.

==Early career==

After joining the bar, he started a law practice with George W. McIlvaine. They dissolved their practice after three years.

==Publishing career==
In 1855, Medill sold his interest in the &quot;Leader&quot; to Cowles and bought the &quot;Tribune&quot; in partnership with Dr. Ray and Alfred Cowles (Edwin&#x27;s brother).

==Political activity==
Medill was a leading Republican in Chicago. Under Medill, the &quot;Tribune&quot; became the leading Republican newspaper in Chicago. Medill was strongly anti-slavery, supporting both the Free-Soil cause and Abolitionism. Medill was a major supporter of Abraham Lincoln in the 1850s. Medill and the &quot;Tribune&quot; were instrumental in Lincoln&#x27;s presidential nomination, and were equally supportive of the Union cause during the American Civil War. The &quot;Tribune&quot;s chief adversary through this period was the &quot;Chicago Times&quot;, which supported the Democrats.

Medill was among Chicago&#x27;s Protestant elites (see, WASP). His rabid anti-Irish sentiment was published daily in The Chicago Tribune. He regularly dismissed the Irish as lazy and shiftless. “Who does not know that the most depraved, debased, worthless and irredeemable drunkards and sots which curse the community are Irish Catholics?” This came even as Irish laborers worked feverishly to complete Chicago&#x27;s stately St. Patrick&#x27;s church at Adams and Desplaines Streets in the mid-1850s.

In 1864, Medill left the &quot;Tribune&quot; editorship for political activity, which occupied him for the next ten years. He was appointed by President Grant to the first Civil Service Commission. In 1870, he was elected as a delegate to the Illinois Constitutional convention.

Medill joined with Samuel Snowden Hayes and Rosell Hough (prominent Chicago Democrats) in order to oppose conditions of military draft laws during the American Civil War, feeling that the government was demanding too many troops to be drafted out of Cook County. On February 23, 1865, they met with President Lincoln. On February 27, they had a meeting with both Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. Stanton rejected their concerns. Lincoln castigated them, particularly chewing-out Medill. Lincoln argued that Chicagoans and Medill&#x27;s newspaper had been most uncompromising in their opposition to the south&#x27;s stance on slavery, and therefore should muster the men demanded of them to supply the Union with troops. 

===Mayoralty===
In 1871, after the Great Chicago Fire, Medill was elected mayor of Chicago as the candidate of the emergency fusion &quot;Union Fireproof&quot; party, defeating Charles C. P. Holden, and served as mayor for two years.

Medill was sworn in as mayor on December 4, 1871.

As mayor, Medill gained more power for the mayor&#x27;s office, created Chicago&#x27;s first public library, enforced blue laws, and reformed the police and fire departments.

During his mayoralty, Medill worked successfully to have the Illinois General Assembly modify the city charter to increase mayoral authority. As mayor-elect, on December 4, 1871, he tapped Judge Murray F. Tuley to draft a &quot;Mayor&#x27;s Bill&quot; to be submitted to the General Assembly in its next session. After successful lobbying by Medill and Tuley, the bill passed on March 9, 1872. It went into effect July 1, 1872, and provided the mayor with the new authority to,
*Serve as presiding officer of the Chicago City Council; to appoint all unelected city officials with the advice and consent of the City Council
*Remove all unelected city officials, with only the requirement that they provide the City Council with reasons for such a removal
*Appoint the standing committees of the City Council and serve as an ex officio member of those committees
*Veto any ordinance, including all or part of an appropriations ordinance, with a two-thirds vote of the City Council required to override such as veto
*Exercise special police powers

In his first year as mayor, Medill received very little legislative resistance from the Chicago City Council. While he vetoed what was an unprecedented eleven City Council ordinances that year, most narrowly were involved with specific financial practices considered wasteful and none of the vetoes were overridden. He used his new powers to appoint the members of the newly constituted Chicago Board of Education and the commissioners of its constituted public library. His appointments were approved unanimously by the City Council.

Medill sought funding for the recovery of Chicago. Medill had strongly lobbied on behalf of the city to receive state financial aid, taking advantage of his connections with state legislators in the state capitol of Springfield, Illinois. While, at the time, state law prohibited the direct appropriation of state funds to the city, Medill was able to get the legislature to pass a special act reimbursing the city for $2.9 million the city had expended on the state-owned Illinois and Michigan Canal. Medill also sought federal financial help. Medill took advantage of his connections in Washington, D.C., to seek such aid. In his third month in office, he wrote Vice President Schuyler Colfax to urge the passage of a tariff rebate that would help increase the supply of inexpensive material for the reconstruction of the city. Despite strong opposition from lumber interests, the legislation succeeded in passing. Medill also convinced President Grant to give a personal $1,000 contribution to aid the city&#x27;s reconstruction. More than $5 million in gifts and loans were collected from people and cities across the world.

Taking Medill&#x27;s lead, on February 12, 1872, the City Council approved 26-6 an ordinance that prohibited the construction of wood frame buildings in city limits.

Medill was a strong Republican loyalist who supported President Grant for re-election in 1872. This caused a breach with Tribune editor, Horace White after White supported the breakaway Liberal Republicans, reformists who nominated Horace Greeley for president.

In his second year as mayor, tensions arose as he began to further utilize the new powers given to the mayor. At the first 1873 meeting of the City Council, Medill announced that he would be using the power to select the chairmen of members of the council committees. He appointed his loyalists to lead most important committees, while aldermen of wards consisting of immigrant populations received lesser consideration for appointments. In the first three months of 1873 alone, Medill practiced his veto power on five City Council ordinances.

Medill and his police superintendent Elmer Washburn cracked down on gambling.

Medill met not only resistance from a City Council divided over his exercise of power and aspects of his agenda, but also resistance from citizens. Anton C. Hesing derided him as &quot;Joseph I, Dictator&quot;.

The stress of the job of mayor impaired Medill&#x27;s health. In August 1873, he appointed Lester L. Bond as Acting Mayor for the remaining 3½ months of his term, and went to Europe on a convalescent tour.

==Personal life==
Medill married Katherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Patrick on September 2, 1852, and they had three daughters, Katherine, Elinor and Josephine. Medill died on March 16, 1899, at the age of 75 in San Antonio, Texas. He was buried at Graceland Cemetery in Chicago.

==Legacy and honors==
During World War II, the Liberty ship was built in Panama City, and named in his honor.

The Medill School of Journalism, Media, and Integrated Marketing Communications at Northwestern University is also named in his honor.

==Relations==
The family tree omits Medill&#x27;s third daughter, Josephine, who died in 1892.

<doc id="40291" wikidata="Q295333" url="?curid=40291" title="Carter Harrison III">
<text>Carter Henry Harrison III (February 15, 1825October 28, 1893) was an American politician who served as mayor of Chicago, Illinois, from 1879 until 1887 and from 1893 until his assassination. He previously served two terms in the United States House of Representatives. Harrison was the first cousin twice removed of President William Henry Harrison, whose grandson, Benjamin Harrison, had also been president until just months prior to the assassination. He was also the father of Carter Harrison IV, who would follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps, and would serve five terms as the mayor of Chicago himself.

==Early life, education, and career==
Harrison was born on a plantation on February 15, 1825, in rural Fayette County, Kentucky near Lexington, Kentucky to Carter Henry Harrison II and Caroline Russell. He was birthed in his family&#x27;s home, a log cabin (as one obituary would remark, &quot;he saw the light in a log hut in a canebrake in Fayette County.&quot;) When Harrison was merely eight months old, his father died.

Harrison&#x27;s family had a long Southern lineage, dating back to early colonial Virginia. He had ancestry in the Harrison family of Virginia, the Randolph family of Virginia, Carter family of Virginia, and Cabell family of Virginia. Harrison was a descendent of Richard A. Harrison, (a lieutenant general to Oliver Cromwell during the First English Civil War who had been involved in carrying out the execution of Charles I). His great-great grandfather was Carter Henry Harrison I (who was a brother of founding father Benjamin Harrison V and a cousin of president Thomas Jefferson). He was a cousin of Vice President John C. Breckinridge, and was also related to presidents William Henry Harrison and Benjamin Harrison.

Harrison was educated by private tutors. At the age of fifteen, he began to be tutored by Louis Marshall. Harrison graduated from Yale College in 1845 as a member of Scroll and Key. He graduated from Yale in 1851. Following graduation, he traveled the world and studied in Europe from 1851 to 1853. His travels took him to England, Ireland, Scotland, and elsewhere. He also visited Egypt and accompanied Bayard Taylor to explore Syria and Asia Minor. After his world travels, he entered Transylvania College in Lexington in 1853, where he earned a law degree in 1855.

==Move to Chicago, and early career in the city==
In 1855, Harrison wed his first wife , Sophy Preston, in 1855. While traveling North for their honeymoon, Harrison stopped in Chicago and decided to settle there. He had decided to settle in Chicago because he saw it as a land of opportunity. At the time, he inherited the Kentucky plantation and almost 100 slaves but sold it away in order to be done with slavery. 

After settling in Chicago, Harrison invested in real estate in Chicago, and became a millionaire. Harrison was also admitted to the bar in 1855, and commenced practice once he settled in Chicago.

The first property that Harrison bought in Chicago was the Adams house located at the corners of Clark and Harrison Street

==Cook County Board of Commissioners (1871–1875)==
After the Great Chicago Fire, Harrison became involved in politics. In the coinciding county elections, Harrison himself was elected to the Cook County Board of Commissioners. Harrison had run on a &quot;union&quot; ticket (dubbed the &quot;Fireproof Ticket&quot;) that featured members of the Democratic and Republican parties. Harrison had been the leading figure in the formation of the Union–Fireproof Ticket and served as the chair of its nominating convention. The ticket ran candidates in both the Cook County and Chicago municipal elections (including in the the mayoral election). The ticket&#x27;s mayoral nominee, Joseph Medill, won election. Harrison had been key in convincing Medill to run for mayor. Later, during Harrison&#x27;s own career in citywide politics, Medill, publisher of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, would come to be a political rival of Harrison&#x27;s.

In addition to being included on Union–Fireproof ticket, Harrison was also included as a county board nominee on the joint slate nominated by both the Cook County Democratic Party and Cook County Republican Party in the 1871 county and Chicago municipal elections (who partnered due to the extenuating circumstances of the fire).

Harrison served a single term on the county board, for three years

==U.S. House of Representatives (1875–1879)==
Harrison represented Illinois&#x27;s 2nd congressional district for two terms (from 1875 until 1879). During the relevant period, with exception of the 6th ward, the district represented all of Chicago&#x27;s &quot;West Division&quot; wards (the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th wards). During his time in congress, Harrison was noted for his flamboyant oration.

===Unsuccessful 1872 campaign===
Early into his tenure on the county board, Harrison ran an unsuccessful campaign in 1872 as the Democratic nominee in Illinois&#x27;s 2nd congressional district for election to the 43rd United States Congress. Harrison faced Republican nominee Jasper D. Ward. The district had a strong Republican lean. Harrison, while unsuccessful, managed to greatly outperform previous Democratic nominees in the district. Harrison won 42.14% of the vote to Ward&#x27;s 57.86%. Harrison led his opponent in the 8th and 9th wards, but trailed him in the other wards.

The congressional election coincided with the 1872 United States presidential election. Harrison (the Democratic congressional nominee) was listed on a local ticket that also included Liberal Republican Party presidential nominee Horace Greeley.

===First term (1875–1877)===
Due to his strong performance in his 1872 congressional campaign, in 1874 Harrison was again nominated in the 2nd congressional district by the Democratic Party for congress, and in a re-match against Ward won election 44th United States Congress by a margin of only eight votes. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; would blame local Republicans&#x27; alignment with the Citizens Union ticket in the 1873 local Chicago elections as detrimental to Ward&#x27;s re-election, as in the eyes of many voters it had placed Republicans on the less popular side of the &quot;beer question&quot; (positioning them in support of enforcing Sunday temperance blue laws (laws banning the sale of alcohol on Sundays). Many voters who typically voted Republican had in 1873 voted for the People&#x27;s Party instead of the Citizens Union ticket due to the &quot;beer question&quot; At the time he was elected, he had been out-of-country visiting Europe with his family (traveling to Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and the Tyrol). After learning of his election, he returned to the United States to take office.

In 1875, during his first term in Congress, Harrison and his family again traveled to Europe. After accompanying his family through Northern Europe, Harrison returned to the United States while the rest of his family continued their trip. However, Harrison traveled to Europe again after his first wife died there.

===Second term (1877–1879)===
While he was out-of-country due to the death of his wife, he was re-elected in 1876 to the 45th United States Congress. He won 50.89% of the vote against Republican opponent George R. Davis.

Scandal occurred in his second term in congress when, as chairman of the Committee on Reform of the Civil Service, Harrison had pushed through the payment of benefits to four self-proclaimed Union Army veterans purporting disabilities from wartime injuries despite the fact that their claims had previously been rejected. None of these individuals had actually seen active service, and none of them had suffered serious injuries. 

in 1878, Harrison lost re-election to congress. He was defeated by Miles Kehoe for re-nomination at the district&#x27;s Democratic nominating convention.

==First mayoralty (1879–1887)==
During his first mayoralty, Harrison was elected mayor of Chicago for four consecutive two-year terms (in 1879, 1881, 1883, and 1885).

After he campaigned in 1879 with a pet eagle, he became affectionately nicknamed &quot;the Eagle&quot;.

He was sworn in for his first term on April 28, 1879.

During his first mayoralty, he surpassed his predecessor Monroe Heath&#x27;s title as the longest serving mayor Chicago had had up to that time.

===Leadership and popularity===
Harrison has been described as a practitioner of charismatic authority. He governed the city in cooperation with a fractious Democratic Party organization.

While Harrison garnered both business and working class support, the evangelical middle class generally disapproved of Harrison.

===Infrastructure and public safety===
At the time he took office, Chicago had nearly a half-million residents. However, it was still a developing city. Harrison would later remark that, when he took office as mayor, &quot;there were not ten miles of paved street in the whole city over which a light vehicle could move rapidly without injury to wheel or axle.” Long a booster of his adopted city, Harrison was known to refer to Chicago as his &quot;bride&quot;. Harrison significantly increased the city&#x27;s number of paved roads and sidewalks in its downtown and increased the size and improved the efficiency of its fire department. Harrison also forced utility companies operating in the central business district to bury their wires. Harrison fought the Illinois Central Railroad&#x27;s right to the lakefront, a legal battle which was ultimately taken by the State of Illinois to Supreme Court of the United States in &quot;Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Illinois&quot;. He also worked to persuade railroads to begin elevating their tracks to eliminate level crossings. He also attempted to push measures in the City Council that would have required locomotives, steamships and tugboats to burn anthracite, which burned cleaner. He also attempted to have the city build new and longer public water system intake pipes.

===Haymarket affair===
Harrison&#x27;s first mayoral tenure was a period that saw many events which brought the city national and international attention. One such event was the Haymarket affair. Early on the evening of the Haymarket affair in 1886, Harrison had casually observed the then still peaceful demonstration of anarchists and trade unionists and advised the police to leave the demonstrators alone; he then left the scene before the riot and anarchist bomb-throwing occurred. A significant reason for his ability to attend the rally unbothered was that, while Harrison came from a Protestant background, he needed the votes of and thus made appeals to the city&#x27;s large ethnic White Catholic population as well as its rapidly growing numbers of trade unionists. His administration gave the impression of being more favorable to trade unions and strikes than those of previous Chicago mayors as well as other mayors of the time, although his police force routinely put down striking workers and trade union activists when they interfered with the businesses hiring replacements.

In the aftermath, Harrison spoke against anti-socialist sentiments being published in the media. Harrison argued that socialists were not sympathetic with bomb throwers, and remarked that socialists were representatives of the country&#x27;s &quot;workers, thinkers, and writers.&quot;

===1884 Democratic National Convention===
Harrison was a delegate to the 1880 and 1884 Democratic National Conventions. At the 1884 convention, held in Chicago, Harrison supported the successful candidacy of Grover Cleveland, and delivered the seconding speech for Cleveland&#x27;s nomination at the convention. Harrison was also alleged to have ordered the Chicago police to fill the convention hall&#x27;s convention hall with as many men sympathetic to Cleveland&#x27;s candidacy as they could find on the street.

===1884 gubernatorial campaign===
Heading encouragement from other Democrats, in 1884 Harrison ran as the party&#x27;s nominee for governor of Illinois. While a reluctant nominee, he conducted an energetic and effective campaign. He lost to Republican incumbent Richard J. Oglesby. The result was unsurprising, considering that the state of Illinois had a strong Republican lean at the time. However, Harrison had managed to decrease the Republican margin of victory in the gubernatorial election from the 40,000 margin of the previous election to 14,500.

===End of tenure===
Towards the end of his fourth term, public approval of Harrison had significantly declined, which hurt his prospects of being re-elected to a fifth term in the 1887 mayoral election. Much of the dissatisfaction with Harrison came from disapproval of his handling of the Haymarket Riot. Harrison&#x27;s handling of the Haymarket Riot had also harmed his standing with conservative business groups. Furthermore, Harrison&#x27;s prospects of re-election to a fifth term was weighed down by a scandal involving criminal charges of election fraud against some of his supporters (for conduct during the previous mayoral election). Even though the charges against these individuals were did not implicate Harrison in misconduct, there was still concern that public awareness of the scandal would muddy Harrison&#x27;s public image due to his proximity to the indicted individuals. Harrison&#x27;s loss of public favor had led the prospect of re-nominating him to lose losing support within city&#x27;s Democratic Party. . Initially, Harrison maintained intention to be re-elected, and unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the United Labor Party to support him for re-election and to partner with the city Democratic Party to nominate a joint-slate. Harrison proposed a fusion nomination arrangement that would have seen the parties nominate identical tickets. Harrison&#x27;s failure to persuade Chicago&#x27;s United Labor Party to partner with city Democrats further harmed Harrison&#x27;s support within the local Democratic party.

Recognizing that he would have difficulty being re-nominated by the Democratic Party, Harrison decided to retire at the end of his fourth term, opting against seeking re-election in 1887. The Democratic Party voted at its convention to nomiante DeWitt Clinton Cregier. However, Cregier declined the nomination, refusing to run. After this (and despite his declared intent to retire) the party voted to re-nominate Harrison. Harrison initially accepted the nomination. However, before he could begin campaigning, his wife (Elizabeth died. Experiencing great grief over his wife&#x27;s passing, he withdrew from the election, and instead embark on international travels. His tenure as mayor formally ended on April 18, 1887. 

==Post-mayoralty==
On July 26, 1887 Harrison embarked on international travels,ref name=&quot;TopekaDailyPress1&quot;/&gt; taking a sixteen-month world tour. He concluded this trip on November 8, 1888. Harrison documented his travels in letters he wrote that were published in newspapers. He compiled his travel writings into a book, which was published under the title &quot;A Race With The Sun&quot;. After returning to Chicago, Harrison continued to be withdrawn from politics for several years. During this time, he focused on his business ventures and authoring literature. In 1890, Harrison and his daughter took a vacation trip from Chicago to Yellowstone National Park and Alaska. His letters from the trip were first published in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and later compiled into an 1891 book, &quot;A Summer&#x27;s Outing and The Old Man&#x27;s Story&quot;.

In 1891, Harrison became the owner and editor of the &quot;Chicago Times&quot;. THis marked a return to political engagement, as he used this newspaper to advocate for labor unions and the many Catholic and immigrant communities in Chicago.

===Unsuccessful 1891 mayoral campaign===
Harrison unsuccessfully sought to stage a comeback, running in the 1891 Chicago mayoral election. Failing to receive the Democratic nomination (with incumbent mayor DeWitt Clinton Cregier being renominated instead), Harrison ran an independent campaign for mayor. The election became a four-candidate race between Harrison, Creiger, Republican nominee Hempstead Washburne, and Citizens nominee Elmer Washburn (a former head of the United States Secret Service and Chicago Police Department). Hempstead Washburne won the election, receiving only a few hundred more votes than runner-up Cregier and a few thousand more votes than Harrison. Elmer Washburn placed a more distant fourth.

==Second mayoralty (1893)==
Harrison was again elected mayor in 1893, in time for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition being held in the city. Harrison stated that his desire was to show the world the &quot;true&quot; Chicago during the world&#x27;s fair.

Harrison was sworn-in for his fifth nonconsecutive term on April 17, 1893. Harrison&#x27;s first acts after being sworn-in were to immediately submit vetoes of several ordinances that the council had already passed, one which served the interests of the Midland Elevated Railway (which stockbroker James R. Keene held significant stake in) and another which would have granted the Hygeia Springs Company permission to supply water into the city. (which would have advanced controversial project by Wisconsin businessman James C. McElroy to pipe water from the famed springs in Waukesha, Wisconsin to the grounds of the world&#x27;s fair). Mayor Washburne had similarly vetoed the same ordinances in his final act as mayor. All vetoes were sustained.

Harrison appointed 1st Ward Alderman &quot;Bathhouse&quot; John Coughlin to sit on the reception committee for the world&#x27;s fair. This appointment was a small part in Harrison&#x27;s plan to create a centralized Democratic Party machine consisting of empowered ward committeemen and precinct captains that would answer to the local Democratic Party. The plan would not be accomplished until Anton Cermak came to power in Chicago politics in the 1920s.

==Assassination==


On October 28, 1893, a few months into his fifth term and just two days before the close of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, Harrison was murdered in his home by Patrick Eugene Prendergast, an office-seeker who had supported Harrison&#x27;s re-election under the idea that Harrison would reward him with an appointment to a post within his mayoral administration. Harrison was buried in Chicago&#x27;s Graceland Cemetery. As part of his funeral services, Harrison lay in state in the City Hall. A celebration planned for the close of the Exposition was cancelled and replaced by a large public memorial service for Harrison. Prendergast was sentenced to death for the crime and hanged on July 13, 1894.

While Harrison died at a time when the elites, Protestants, and Republicans of all kinds greatly disliked him, he never lost his core supporters of labor unions, Catholics and immigrants. He was Chicago&#x27;s first mayor to be elected five times; eventually his son Carter Harrison IV was also elected mayor five times.

Harrison&#x27;s career and assassination are closely associated with the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, and are discussed at some length as a subplot to the two main stories (about the fair and serial killer H. H. Holmes) in Erik Larson&#x27;s best-selling 2003 non-fiction book &quot;The Devil in the White City&quot;.

==Political positions==
Harrison was a populist Democrat.

Harrison did not disapprove of liquor consumption or gambling.

Hailing from a border state and wed to a woman who hailed from the Deep South, during the American Civil War, Harrison had occasionally openly expressed sympathy towards the Confederate cause, leading him to be derided as a Copperhead.

Harrison saw the city&#x27;s strength as being in its neighborhoods, and viewed it as a city of neighborhoods.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and late engagement===
On April 12, 1855, Harrison married his first wife, the former Sophie Preston. She hailed from the Preston family, a distinguished southern family. Harrison and his first wife, Sophie, had ten children together. Six of their children died either in infancy or early childhood.

Harrison became a widower after Sophie died in Europe in 1876. After being widowed, Harrison married Margarette (alternatively spelled &quot;Margaret&quot; or &quot;Marguerite&quot;) E. Stearns in 1882. Stearns was a member of one of Chicago&#x27;s earliest and most wealthy families, being the daughter of Chicago pioneer Marcus C. Stearns. He was widowed again when she died in 1887.

At the time of his assassination, Harrison was engaged to a young New Orleans heiress named Annie Howard, daughter of Louisiana State Lottery Company organizer Charles T. Howard, who had been worth an estimated $3,000,000, $700,000 of which she had inherited from him after his death.

===Children===
Harrison and his first wife, Sophie, had ten children together. Six of their children died either in infancy or early childhood. 

The four children whom survived to adulthood were Lina, Carter IV, William Preston, and Sophie.

Lina married Heaton Owsley, and became the step-mother of Jack Owsley (who became a noted American football player and coach, as well as a successful businessman). She and Owsley had a daughter who they also named Lina Harrison Owsley. This daughter of the Owsleys (granddaughter of Mayor Harrison) performed as an opera singer, studying opera under Hermann Devriès. In 1912, she married Paul Bartlett, a noted painter.

Carter IV served as mayor of Chicago from 1887–1805 and 1911–1915. He married Edith Ogden (who would garner note as the author of children&#x27;s fairytale books) in 1887. Together, they had three children. Their firstborn died in infancy in 1889. Their other two children survived to adulthood: son Carter V (born in 1891) and daughter Edith II (born 1896).

==Legacy==
The Carter H. Harrison Medal is one of two medals &quot;granted to sworn members of the fire and police departments who have performed distinguished acts of bravery in the protection of life or property&quot;, the other being the Lambert Tree Award.

A statue of Harrison is in Union Park on Chicago&#x27;s Near West Side, about two blocks from the Ashland Avenue home where he lived and was murdered in 1893. It was erected in 1907. The plaque on the statue is a quote from Harrison&#x27;s address to the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, given hours before he died.

<text>Carter Henry Harrison IV (April 23, 1860 – December 25, 1953) was an American newspaper publisher and Democratic politician who served a total of five terms as mayor of Chicago (1897–1905 and 1911–1915) but failed in his attempt to become his party&#x27;s presidential nominee in 1904. Descended from aristocratic Virginia families and the son of five-term Chicago mayor Carter Harrison III, this Carter Harrison (IV) became the first native Chicagoan elected its mayor.

==Biography==

Harrison was born on April 23, 1860, in Chicago.

He was a member of many organizations including the Freemasons, Knights Templar, Society of the Cincinnati, Sons of the Revolution, Sons of the American Revolution, Society of Colonial Wars, Veterans of Foreign Wars, American Legion, and the Military Order of the World Wars.

Like his father, Carter Harrison III, Harrison gained election to five terms as Chicago&#x27;s mayor. Educated in Saxe-Altenburg, Germany, Harrison returned to Chicago to help his brother run the &quot;Chicago Times&quot;, which their father bought in 1891. He had been a practicing lawyer before joining his family in running the &quot;Times&quot;. Under the Harrisons the paper became a resolute supporter of the Democratic Party, and was the only local newspaper to support the Pullman strikers in the mid-1890s. Harrison served as the newspapers editor. He stopped working at the newspaper in 1895.

===First mayoralty===
Harrison was first elected mayor in the 1897 Chicago mayoral election. He would win election to three consecutive additional two-year terms in 1899, 1901, and 1903.

Harrison was sworn in as mayor on April 15, 1897.

Like his father, Harrison did not believe in trying to legislate morality. As mayor, Harrison believed that Chicagoans&#x27; two major desires were to make money and to spend it. During his administrations, Chicago&#x27;s vice districts blossomed, and special maps were printed to enable tourists to find their way from brothel to brothel. The name of one Chicago saloon-keeper of the time supposedly entered the English language as a term for a strong or laced drink intended to render unconsciousness: Mickey Finn.

However, Harrison was seen as more of a reformer than his father, which helped him garner the middle class votes his father had lacked. One of Harrison&#x27;s biggest enemies was Charles Yerkes, whose plans to monopolize Chicago&#x27;s streetcar lines were vigorously attacked by the mayor. This was the beginning of the Chicago Traction Wars, which would become a major focus of his administration. During his final term in office, Harrison established the Chicago Vice Commission and worked to close down the Levee district, starting with the Everleigh Club brothel on October 24, 1911.

Despite prolonged and damaging international press coverage blaming his lax municipal enforcement for the 602 lives lost in the Iroquois Theatre fire on December 30, 1903 (still the deadliest single-building fire in U.S. history), Harrison hoped to become the 1904 Democratic nominee for President of the United States. However, the nomination went to Alton B. Parker, who was soundly defeated by Theodore Roosevelt.

Harrison declined to seek a fifth consecutive mayoral term in 1905, and was succeeded by fellow Democrat Edward Fitzsimmons Dunne on April 10, 1905.

===Between mayoralties===
In 1907, attempting to stage a return to office, Harrison unsuccessfully challenged Dunne for the Democratic mayoral nomination.

===Second mayoralty===
In 1911, Harrison was elected to a four-year term as mayor. He as sworn in for his fifth nonconsecutive term as mayor on April 17, 1911.

In 1914, Harrison convinced the city council to establish a Commission for the Encouragement of Local Art to purchase works of art by Chicago artists. Harrison personally purchased artwork from painters such as Victor Higgins and Walter Ufer.

Harrison sought a sixth overall term as mayor in 1915, but was defeated in the Democratic primary by Robert Sweitzer, who went on to lose the general election to Republican William Hale Thompson. Harrison was succeeded in office by Thompson on April 26, 1915.

In 1915, when Harrison left office, Chicago had essentially reached its modern size in land area, and had a population of 2,400,000; the city was moving inexorably into its status as a major modern metropolis. He and his father had collectively been mayors of the city for 21 of the previous 36 years.

===Post-mayoralty===
From 1933 through 1944, Harrison served as the Internal Revenue Service collector for district of Chicago, having been appointed to the position by president Franklin D. Roosevelt on July 28, 1933.

Harrison served as the president of a commission which advocated for local arts.

Harrison published two autobiographies. One of these, a memoir entitled &quot;Growing Up with Chicago&quot;, was published in 1944.

Harrison died on December 25, 1953, in Chicago at his Chicago apartment, and is buried in Graceland Cemetery.

His papers are held by Chicago&#x27;s Newberry Library.

==Ancestry and personal life==
Harrison was a descendant of Robert Carter I, Benjamin Harrison IV, William Randolph, and Isham Randolph of Dungeness.

His wife, Edith Ogden Harrison, was a well-known writer of children&#x27;s books and fairy tales in the first two decades of the 20th century.

In 1907 Harrison became a hereditary member of the Virginia Society of the Cincinnati.

<text>The Nikkei 225, or , more commonly called the Nikkei or the Nikkei index (), is a stock market index for the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). It is a price-weighted index, operating in the Japanese Yen (JP¥), and its components are reviewed twice a year. The Nikkei 225 measures the performance of 225 highly capitalised and liquid publicly owned companies in Japan from a wide array of industry sectors. Since 2017, the index is calculated every five seconds. It was originally launched by the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1950, and was taken over by the &quot;Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot; (&quot;The Nikkei&quot;) newspaper in 1970, when the Tokyo Exchange switched to the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), which is weighed by market capitalisation rather than stock prices.

==History==
The Nikkei 225 began to be calculated on 7 September 1950, retroactively calculated back to 16 May 1949, when the average price of its component stocks was 176.21 yen. Since July 2017, the index is updated every 5 seconds during trading sessions.

The Nikkei 225 Futures, introduced at Singapore Exchange (SGX) in 1986, the Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE) in 1988, Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in 1990, is now an internationally recognized futures index.

The Nikkei average has deviated sharply from the textbook model of stock averages, which grow at a steady exponential rate. During the Japanese asset price bubble, the average hit its bubble-era record high on 29 December 1989, when it reached an intraday high of 38,957.44, before closing at 38,915.87, having grown sixfold during the decade. Subsequently, it lost nearly all these gains, reaching a post-bubble intraday low of 6,994.90 on 28 October 2008 — 82% below its peak nearly 19 years earlier. The 1989 record high held for 34 years, until it was surpassed in 2024 (see below).

On 15 March 2011, the second working day after the massive earthquake in the northeast part of Japan, the index dropped over 10% to finish at 8,605.15, a loss of 1,015 points. The index continued to drop throughout 2011, bottoming out at 8,160.01 on 25 November, putting it at its lowest close since 31 March 2009. The Nikkei fell over 17% in 2011, finishing the year at 8,455.35, its lowest year-end closing value in nearly thirty years, when the index finished at 8,016.70 in 1982.

The Nikkei started 2013 near 10,600, hitting a peak of 15,942 in May. However, shortly afterward, it plunged by almost 10% before rebounding, making it the most volatile stock market index among the developed markets. By 2015, it had reached over 20,000 mark, marking a gain of over 10,000 in two years, making it one of the fastest growing stock market indices in the world. However, by 2018, the index growth was more moderate at around the 22,000 mark.

There was concern that the rise since 2013 was artificial and due to purchases by the Bank of Japan (&quot;BOJ&quot;). From a start in 2013, by end 2017, the BOJ owned circa 75% of all Japanese Exchange Traded Funds (&quot;ETFs&quot;), and were a top 10 shareholder of 90% of the Nikkei 225 constituents.

On 15 February 2021, the Nikkei average breached the 30,000 benchmark, its highest level in 30 years, due to the levels of monetary stimulus and asset purchase programs executed by the Bank of Japan to mitigate the financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 22 February 2024, the Nikkei reached an intraday high of 39,156.97 and closed at 39,098.68, finally surpassing its 1989 record high, an important milestone since the Japanese asset price bubble. On 4 March 2024, the index surpassed 40,000 (intraday and closing) for the first time in history.

On 5 August 2024, amid a global stock market decline, the Nikkei dropped by more than 4,200 points, surpassing 1987&#x27;s Black Monday as its biggest single-day drop in history. The following day, it bounced back by more than 3,200 points, the largest single-day gain in history.

<text>Stephen Smale (born July 15, 1930) is an American mathematician, known for his research in topology, dynamical systems and mathematical economics. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966 and spent more than three decades on the mathematics faculty of the University of California, Berkeley (1960–1961 and 1964–1995), where he currently is Professor Emeritus, with research interests in algorithms, numerical analysis and global analysis.

==Education and career==
Smale was born in Flint, Michigan and entered the University of Michigan in 1948. Initially, he was a good student, placing into an honors calculus sequence taught by Bob Thrall and earning himself A&#x27;s. However, his sophomore and junior years were marred with mediocre grades, mostly Bs, Cs and even an F in nuclear physics. Smale obtained his Bachelor of Science degree in 1952. Despite his grades, with some luck, Smale was accepted as a graduate student at the University of Michigan&#x27;s mathematics department. Yet again, Smale performed poorly in his first years, earning a C average as a graduate student. When the department chair, Hildebrandt, threatened to kick Smale out, he began to take his studies more seriously. Smale finally earned his PhD in 1957, under Raoul Bott, beginning his career as an instructor at the University of Chicago.

Early in his career, Smale was involved in controversy over remarks he made regarding his work habits while proving the higher-dimensional Poincaré conjecture. He said that his best work had been done &quot;on the beaches of Rio.&quot; He has been politically active in various movements in the past, such as the Free Speech movement and member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. In 1966, having travelled to Moscow under an NSF grant to accept the Fields Medal, he held a press conference there to denounce the American position in Vietnam, Soviet intervention in Hungary and Soviet maltreatment of intellectuals. After his return to the US, he was unable to renew the grant. At one time he was subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee.

In 1960, Smale received a Sloan Research Fellowship and was appointed to the Berkeley mathematics faculty, moving to a professorship at Columbia the following year. In 1964 he returned to a professorship at Berkeley, where he has spent the main part of his career. He became a professor emeritus at Berkeley in 1995 and took up a post as professor at the City University of Hong Kong. He also amassed over the years one of the finest private mineral collections in existence. Many of Smale&#x27;s mineral specimens can be seen in the book &quot;The Smale Collection: Beauty in Natural Crystals&quot;.

From 2003 to 2012, Smale was a professor at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago; starting August 1, 2009, he became a Distinguished University Professor at the City University of Hong Kong.

In 1988, Smale was the recipient of the Chauvenet Prize of the MAA. In 2007, Smale was awarded the Wolf Prize in mathematics.

==Research==
Smale proved that the oriented diffeomorphism group of the two-dimensional sphere has the same homotopy type as the special orthogonal group of matrices. Smale&#x27;s theorem has been reproved and extended a few times, notably to higher dimensions in the form of the Smale conjecture, as well as to other topological types.

In another early work, he studied the immersions of the two-dimensional sphere into Euclidean space. By relating immersion theory to the algebraic topology of Stiefel manifolds, he was able to fully clarify when two immersions can be deformed into one another through a family of immersions. Directly from his results it followed that the standard immersion of the sphere into three-dimensional space can be deformed (through immersions) into its negation, which is now known as sphere eversion. He also extended his results to higher-dimensional spheres, and his doctoral student Morris Hirsch extended his work to immersions of general smooth manifolds. Along with John Nash&#x27;s work on isometric immersions, the Hirsch–Smale immersion theory was highly influential in Mikhael Gromov&#x27;s early work on development of the h-principle, which abstracted and applied their ideas to contexts other than that of immersions.

In the study of dynamical systems, Smale introduced what is now known as a Morse–Smale system. For these dynamical systems, Smale was able to prove Morse inequalities relating the cohomology of the underlying space to the dimensions of the (un)stable manifolds. Part of the significance of these results is from Smale&#x27;s theorem asserting that the gradient flow of any Morse function can be arbitrarily well approximated by a Morse–Smale system without closed orbits. Using these tools, Smale was able to construct &quot;self-indexing&quot; Morse functions, where the value of the function equals its Morse index at any critical point. Using these self-indexing Morse functions as a key tool, Smale resolved the generalized Poincaré conjecture in every dimension greater than four. Building on these works, he also established the more powerful h-cobordism theorem the following year, together with the full classification of simply-connected smooth five-dimensional manifolds.

Smale also introduced the horseshoe map, inspiring much subsequent research. He also outlined a research program carried out by many others. Smale is also known for injecting Morse theory into mathematical economics, as well as recent explorations of various theories of computation.

In 1998 he compiled a list of 18 problems in mathematics to be solved in the 21st century, known as Smale&#x27;s problems. This list was compiled in the spirit of Hilbert&#x27;s famous list of problems produced in 1900. In fact, Smale&#x27;s list contains some of the original Hilbert problems, including the Riemann hypothesis and the second half of Hilbert&#x27;s sixteenth problem, both of which are still unsolved. Other famous problems on his list include the Poincaré conjecture (now a theorem, proved by Grigori Perelman), the P = NP problem, and the Navier–Stokes equations, all of which have been designated Millennium Prize Problems by the Clay Mathematics Institute.

<doc id="40295" wikidata="Q128993" url="?curid=40295" title="Hawker Siddeley Nimrod">
<text>The Hawker Siddeley Nimrod is a retired maritime patrol aircraft developed and operated by the United Kingdom. It was an extensive modification of the de Havilland Comet, the world&#x27;s first operational jet airliner. It was originally designed by de Havilland&#x27;s successor firm, Hawker Siddeley; further development and maintenance work was undertaken by Hawker Siddeley&#x27;s own successor companies, British Aerospace and, later, BAE Systems.

Designed in response to a requirement issued by the Royal Air Force (RAF) to replace its fleet of ageing Avro Shackletons, the &quot;Nimrod MR1&quot;/&quot;MR2&quot;s were fixed-wing aerial platforms primarily for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations; secondary roles included maritime surveillance and anti-surface warfare. It served from the early 1970s until March 2010. The intended replacement was to be extensively rebuilt Nimrod MR2s, designated Nimrod MRA4. Due to considerable delays, repeated cost overruns, and financial cutbacks, the development of the MRA4 was abandoned in 2010.

The RAF also operated three Nimrod R1, an electronic intelligence gathering (ELINT) variant. A dedicated airborne early warning platform, the Nimrod AEW3, was in development from late 1970s to the mid-1980s; however, much like the MRA4, considerable problems were encountered in development and thus the project was cancelled in 1986 in favour of an off-the-shelf solution in the Boeing E-3 Sentry. All Nimrod variants had been retired by mid-2011.

==Development==
===MR1===
On 4 June 1964, the British Government issued Air Staff Requirement 381, which sought a replacement for the aging Avro Shackleton maritime patrol aircraft of the Royal Air Force (RAF). Such a replacement had been necessitated by the rapidly-approaching fatigue life limitations accumulated across the Shackleton fleet. A great deal of interest in the requirement was received from both British and foreign manufacturers, who offered aircraft including the Lockheed P-3 Orion, the Breguet Atlantic and derivatives of the Hawker Siddeley Trident, BAC One-Eleven, Vickers VC10 and de Havilland Comet. On 2 February 1965, Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced the intention to order Hawker Siddeley&#x27;s maritime patrol version of the Comet, the HS.801 as a replacement for Shackleton Mk 2.

The Nimrod design was based on the Comet 4 civil airliner which had reached the end of its commercial life (the first two prototype Nimrods, XV148 and XV147, were built from two final unfinished Comet 4C airframes). The Comet&#x27;s turbojet engines were replaced by Rolls-Royce Spey turbofans for better fuel efficiency, particularly at the low altitudes required for maritime patrol. Major fuselage changes were made, including an internal weapons bay, an extended nose for radar, a new tail with electronic warfare (ESM) sensors mounted in a bulky fairing, and a MAD (magnetic anomaly detector) boom. After the first flight in May 1967, the RAF ordered 46 Nimrod MR1s. The first example (XV230) entered service in October 1969. A total of five squadrons using the type were established; four were permanently based in the UK and a fifth was initially based in Malta.

===R1===
Three Nimrod aircraft were adapted for the signals intelligence role, replacing the Comet C2s and Canberras of No. 51 Squadron in May 1974. The R1 was visually distinguished from the MR2 by the lack of a MAD boom. It was fitted with an array of rotating dish aerials in the aircraft&#x27;s bomb bay, with further dish aerials in the tailcone and at the front of the wing-mounted fuel tanks. It had a flight crew of four (two pilots, a flight engineer and one navigator) and up to 25 crew operating the SIGINT equipment.

Only since the end of the Cold War has the role of the aircraft been officially acknowledged; they were once described as &quot;radar calibration aircraft&quot;. The R1s have not suffered the same rate of fatigue and corrosion as the MR2s. One R1 was lost in a flying accident since the type&#x27;s introduction; this occurred in May 1995 during a flight test after major servicing, at RAF Kinloss. To replace this aircraft an MR2 was selected for conversion to R1 standard, and entered service in December 1996.

The Nimrod R1 was based initially at RAF Wyton, Cambridgeshire, and later at RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, and flown by 51 Sqn. The two remaining Nimrod R1s were originally planned to be retired at the end of March 2011, but operational requirements forced the RAF to deploy one to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus on 16 March in support of Operation Ellamy. The last flight of the type was on 28 June 2011 from RAF Waddington, in the presence of the Chief of the Air Staff, ACM Sir Stephen Dalton. XV 249, the former MR2, is now on display at the RAF Museum Cosford, West Midlands. The R1 was replaced by three Boeing RC-135W &quot;Rivet Joint&quot; aircraft, acquired under the Airseeker project; the first aircraft was delivered in late 2013.

===MR2===

Starting in 1975, 35 aircraft were upgraded to MR2 standard, being re-delivered from August 1979. The upgrade included extensive modernisation of the aircraft&#x27;s electronic suite. Changes included the replacement of the 1950s ASV Mk 21 radar used by the Shackleton and Nimrod MR1 with the new EMI Searchwater radar, a new acoustic processor (GEC-Marconi AQS-901) capable of handling more modern sonobuoys, a new mission data recorder (Hanbush) and a new Electronic Support Measures (Yellow Gate) which included new pods on the wingtips.

Provision for in-flight refuelling was introduced during the Falklands War (as the &quot;MR2P&quot;), as well as hardpoints to allow the Nimrod to carry the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile to counter enemy Argentine Air Force maritime surveillance aircraft. In preparation for operations in the Gulf War theatre, several MR2s were fitted with new communications and ECM equipment to deal with anticipated threats; at the time these modified aircraft were given the designation &quot;MR2P(GM) (Gulf Mod)&quot;.

The Nimrod MR2 carried out three main roles: Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Anti-Surface Unit Warfare (ASUW) and Search and Rescue (SAR). Its extended range enabled the crew to monitor maritime areas far to the north of Iceland and up to out into the Western Atlantic. With Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR), range and endurance was greatly extended. The crew consisted of two pilots and one flight engineer, two navigators (one tactical navigator and a routine navigator), one Air Electronics Officer (AEO), the sonobuoy sensor team of two Weapon System Operators (WSOp ACO) and four Weapon System Operators (WSOp EW) to manage passive and active electronic warfare systems.

Until 2010, the Nimrod MR2 was based at RAF Kinloss in Scotland (120, 201 and 206 Squadrons), and RAF St Mawgan in Cornwall (42 and 38(R) Squadrons). Following Options for Change, 42 Squadron was disbanded and its number reassigned to 38(R) Squadron. The Nimrod MR2 aircraft was withdrawn on 31 March 2010, a year earlier than planned, for financial reasons. The last official flight of a Nimrod MR2 took place on 26 May 2010, with XV229 flying from RAF Kinloss to Kent International Airport to be used as an evacuation training airframe at the nearby MOD Defence Fire Training and Development Centre.

===AEW3===
In the mid-1970s a modified Nimrod was proposed for the Airborne Early Warning (AEW) mission – again as a replacement for the Lancaster-derived, piston-engined Shackleton AEW.2. Eleven existing Nimrod airframes were to be converted by British Aerospace to house the GEC Marconi radars in a bulbous nose and tail. The Nimrod AEW3 project was plagued by cost over-runs and problems with the GEC 4080M computer used. Eventually, the MoD recognised that the cost of developing the radar system to achieve the required level of performance was prohibitive and the probability of success very uncertain, and in December 1986 the project was cancelled. The RAF eventually received seven Boeing E-3 Sentry aircraft instead.

===MRA4===

The Nimrod MRA4 was intended to replace the capability provided by the MR2. It was essentially a new aircraft, with current-generation Rolls-Royce BR710 turbofan engines, a new larger wing, and fully refurbished fuselage. The project was subject to delays, cost over-runs, and contract re-negotiations. The type had been originally intended to enter service in 2003 but was cancelled in 2010 as a result of the Strategic Defence and Security Review, at which point it was £789 million over-budget; the development airframes were also scrapped. Some functions were allocated to other assets, with Hercules transport aircraft and E-3 Sentry Airborne Early Warning aircraft given some tasks, but the cancellation of the MRA4 resulted in a significant gap in long-range maritime patrol and search-and rescue capability.

In July 2016, the Ministry of Defence announced the purchase of nine Boeing P-8A Poseidon aircraft for the RAF. The RAF declared the P-8 had reached initial operating capability (IOC) on 1 April 2020, by which time two of the planes had been delivered. The nine aircraft will be based at RAF Lossiemouth.

==Design==

===Overview===
The Nimrod was the first jet-powered MPA to enter service, being powered by the Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engine. Aircraft in this role had been commonly propelled by piston or turboprop powerplants instead to maximise fuel economy and enable maximum patrol time on station. Advantages of the Nimrod&#x27;s turbofan engines included greater speed and altitude capabilities, and it was more capable of evading detection by submarines, as propeller-driven aircraft are more detectable underwater by standard acoustic sensors. The Nimrods had a flight endurance of ten hours without aerial refuelling. The MR2s were later fitted to receive mid-air refuelling in response to demands of the Falklands War.
At the start of a patrol mission all four engines would normally be running; as the aircraft&#x27;s weight was reduced by fuel consumption, up to two engines could be shut down, allowing the remaining engines to be operated more efficiently. Instead of relying on ram air to restart an inactive engine, compressor air could be crossfed from a live engine to a starter turbine. The crossfeed duct was later discovered to be a potential fire hazard. Similarly, the two hydraulic systems on board were designed to be powered by the two inner engines that would always be running. Electrical generation was designed to far exceed the consumption of existing equipment to accommodate additional systems installed over the Nimrod&#x27;s service life.

The standard Nimrod fleet carried out three basic operational roles during their RAF service: Anti-Submarine Warfare duties typically involved surveillance over an allocated area of the North Atlantic to detect the presence of Soviet submarines in that area and to track their movements. In the event of war, reconnaissance information gathered during these patrols would be shared with other allied aircraft to enable coordinated strikes at both submarines and surface targets. Search and rescue (SAR) missions were another important duty of the RAF&#x27;s Nimrod fleet, operating under the Air Rescue Coordination Centre at RAF Kinloss and were a common sight in both military and civil maritime incidents. Throughout the Nimrod&#x27;s operational life, a minimum of one aircraft was held in a state of readiness to respond to SAR demands at all times.

===Avionics===
The Nimrod featured a crew of up to 25 personnel, although a typical crew numbered roughly 12, most of whom operated the various onboard sensor suites and specialist detection equipment. A significant proportion of the onboard sensor equipment was housed outside the pressure shell inside the Nimrod&#x27;s distinctive pannier lower fuselage. Sensor systems included radar, ESM radar detection and sonar.The Nimrod and its detection capabilities were an important component of Britain&#x27;s military defence during the height of the Cold War.

The Nimrod&#x27;s navigational functions were computerised, and were managed from a central tactical compartment housed in the forward cabin. Various functions such as weapons control and information from sensors such as the large forward doppler radar were displayed and controlled at the tactical station. The flight systems and autopilot could be directly controlled by navigator&#x27;s stations in the tactical compartment, giving the navigator nearly complete aircraft control. The navigational systems comprised digital, analogue, and electro-mechanical elements. The computers were integrated with most of the Nimrod&#x27;s guidance systems such as the air data computer, astrocompass, inertial guidance and doppler radar. Navigation information could also be manually input by the operators.

Upon entry into service, the Nimrod was hailed as possessing advanced electronic equipment such as onboard digital computers. The increased capability of these electronic systems allowed the RAF&#x27;s fleet of 46 Nimrod aircraft to provide equal coverage to that of the larger fleet of retiring Avro Shackletons. The design philosophy of these computerised systems was that of a &#x27;man-machine partnership&#x27;; while onboard computers performed much of the data sift and analysis processes, decisions and actions on the basis of that data remained in the operator&#x27;s hands. To support the Nimrod&#x27;s anticipated long lifespan, onboard computers were designed to be capable of integrating with various new components, systems, and sensors that could be added in future upgrades. After a mission, gathered information could be extracted for review purposes and for further analysis.

===Armaments and equipment===
The Nimrod featured a sizeable bomb bay in which, in addition to armaments such as torpedoes and missiles, could be housed a wide variety of specialist equipment for many purposes, such as up to 150 sonobuoys for ASW purposes or multiple air-deployed dinghies and droppable survival packs such as Lindholme Gear for SAR missions; additional fuel tanks and cargo could also be carried in the bomb bay during ferrying flights. Other armaments equippable in the bomb bay include mines, bombs, and nuclear depth charges; later munitions included the Sting Ray torpedo and Harpoon missile for increased capability.
The Nimrod could also be fitted with two detachable pylons mounted underneath the wings to be used with missiles such as the Martel; two specialised pylons were later added to enable the equipping of AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, used for self-defence purposes against hostile aircraft. A powerful remote-controlled searchlight was installed underneath the starboard wing for SAR operations. For reconnaissance missions, the aircraft was also equipped with a pair of downward-facing cameras suited to low and high-altitude photography. In later years a newer electro-optical camera system was installed for greater imaging quality.

Various new ECMs and electronic support systems were retrofitted onto the Nimrod fleet in response to new challenges and to increase the type&#x27;s defensive capabilities; additional equipment also provided more effective means of identification and communication. A number of modifications were introduced during the 1991 Gulf War; a small number of MR2s were fitted with improved Link 11 datalinks, new defensive ECM equipment including the first operational use of a towed radar decoy, and a forward looking infrared turret under the starboard wing.

==Operational history==

===Introduction to service===
The Nimrod first entered squadron service with the RAF at RAF St Mawgan in Cornwall in October 1969. These initial aircraft, designated as Nimrod MR1, were intended as a stop-gap measure, and thus were initially equipped with many of the same sensors and equipment as the Shackletons they were supplementing. While some improvements were implemented on the MR1 fleet to enhance their detection capabilities, the improved Nimrod MR2 variant entered service in August 1979 following a lengthy development process. The majority of the Nimrod fleet operated from RAF Kinloss in Scotland.
Operationally, each active Nimrod would form a single piece of a complex submarine detection and monitoring mission. An emphasis on real-time intelligence sharing was paramount to these operations; upon detecting a submarine, Nimrod aircrews would inform Royal Navy frigates and other NATO-aligned vessels to pursuit in an effort to continuously monitor Soviet submarines. The safeguarding of the Royal Navy&#x27;s &quot;Resolution&quot;-class ballistic missile submarines, which were the launch platform for Britain&#x27;s nuclear deterrent, was viewed as being of the utmost priority.

===Falklands War===
Nimrods were first deployed to Wideawake airfield on Ascension Island on 5 April 1982, the type at first being used to fly local patrols around Ascension to guard against potential Argentine attacks, and to escort the British Task Force as it sailed south towards the Falklands, with Nimrods also being used to provide search and rescue as well as communications relay support of the Operation Black Buck bombing raids by Avro Vulcans. As the Task Force neared what would become the combat theatre and the threat from Argentine submarines rose, the more capable Nimrod MR2s took on operations initially performed by older Nimrod MR1s. Aviation author Chris Chant has claimed that the Nimrod R1 also conducted electronic intelligence missions operating from Punta Arenas in neutral Chile. The Chilean government allowed an RAF Nimrod R1 to fly signals reconnaissance sorties from the Desventuradas Islands, gathering information on Argentine Air Force movements.

The addition of air-to-air refuelling probes allowed operations to be carried out in the vicinity of the Falklands, while the aircraft&#x27;s armament was supplemented by the addition of general-purpose bombs, BL755 cluster bombs and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. The use of air-to-air refuelling allowed extremely long reconnaissance missions to be mounted, one example being a 19-hour 5-minute patrol conducted on 15 May 1982 (XV232 Airborne: 0803, Landing: 0308), which passed within of the Argentine coast to confirm that Argentine surface vessels were not at sea. Another long-range flight was carried out by an MR2 on the night of 20/21 May, covering a total of , the longest distance flight carried out during the Falklands War. In all, Nimrods flew 111 missions from Ascension in support of British operations during the Falklands War.

===Gulf War===
A detachment of three Nimrod MR2s was deployed to Seeb in Oman in August 1990 as a result of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, carrying out patrols over the Gulf of Oman and Persian Gulf. Due to the level of threats present in the Gulf theatre, operational Nimrods were quickly retrofitted with a Marconi towed active decoy. Once hostilities commenced, the Nimrod detachment, by now increased to five aircraft, concentrated on night patrols, with daylight patrols carried out by US Navy Lockheed P-3 Orions. Nimrods were used to guide Westland Lynx helicopters and Grumman A-6 Intruder attack aircraft against Iraqi patrol vessels, being credited with assisting in sinking or damaging 16 Iraqi vessels.
After the ground offensive against Iraqi forces had ended, Britain elected to maintain an RAF presence in the region through assets such as the Nimrod and other aircraft. Nimrod R1s operated from August 1990 to March 1991 from Cyprus, providing almost continuous flying operations from the start of the ground offensive. Each R1 was retrofitted with the same Marconi towed active decoy as well as under wing chaff/flare dispensers, reportedly sourced from the Tornado fleet.

===Afghanistan and Iraq War===
Nimrods were again deployed to the Middle East as part of the British contribution to the US-led invasion of Afghanistan; missions in this theatre involved the Nimrods performing lengthy overland flights for intelligence-gathering purposes. On 2 September 2006, 14 UK military personnel were killed when a Nimrod MR2 was destroyed in a midair explosion following an onboard fire over Afghanistan. It was the single greatest loss of British military lives since the Falklands War. The outbreak of the Iraq War in March 2003 saw the RAF&#x27;s Nimrods being used for operations over Iraq, using the aircraft&#x27;s sensors to detect hostile forces and to direct attacks by friendly coalition forces.

===Search and rescue===
While the Nimrod MR1/MR2 was in service, one aircraft from each of the squadrons on rotation was available for search and rescue operations at one-hour standby. The standby aircraft carried two sets of Lindholme Gear in the weapons bay. Usually one other Nimrod airborne on a training mission would also carry a set of Lindholme Gear. As well as using the aircraft sensors to find aircraft or ships in distress, it was used to find survivors in the water, with a capability to search areas of up to . The main role would normally be to act as on-scene rescue coordinator to control ships, fixed-wing aircraft, and helicopters in the search area.

The Nimrod was most often featured in the media in relation to its search-and-rescue role, such as in the reporting of major rescue incidents. In August 1979, several Nimrods were involved in locating yachting competitors during the disaster-stricken 1979 Fastnet race and coordinated with helicopters in searches for survivors from lost vessels. In March 1980, the &quot;Alexander L. Kielland&quot;, a Norwegian semi-submersible drilling rig, capsized whilst working in the Ekofisk oil field killing 123 people; six different Nimrods searched for survivors and took turns to provide rescue co-ordination, involving the control of 80 surface ships and 20 British and Norwegian helicopters. In an example of its search capabilities, in September 1977 when an attempted crossing of the North Atlantic in a Zodiac inflatable dinghy went wrong, a Nimrod found the collapsed dinghy and directed a ship to it.

===Operation Tapestry===
The Nimrods were often used to enforce Operation Tapestry. Tapestry is a codeword for the activities by ships and aircraft that protect the United Kingdom&#x27;s Sovereign Sea Areas, including the protection of fishing rights and oil and gas extraction. Following the establishment of a Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) at the beginning of 1977 the Nimrod fleet was given the task of patrolling the area. The aircraft would locate, identify, and photograph vessels operating in the EEZ. The whole area was routinely patrolled. In addition to surveillance, the aircraft would communicate with all oil and gas platforms. During the Icelandic Cod Wars of 1972 and 1975–1976, the Nimrod fleet closely cooperated with Royal Navy surface vessels to protect British civilian fishing ships.

==Accidents and incidents==
Five Nimrods were lost in accidents during the type&#x27;s service with the RAF:

*On 17 November 1980, a Nimrod MR2 XV256 crashed near RAF Kinloss after three engines failed following multiple birdstrikes. Both pilots were killed but the remaining crew survived.
*On 3 June 1984, a Nimrod MR2 XV257 stationed at RAF St Mawgan suffered extensive damage when a reconnaissance flare ignited in the bomb bay during flight. The aircraft successfully returned to base but was subsequently written off due to fire damage. There were no casualties.
*On 16 May 1995, a Nimrod R1 XW666 ditched in the Moray Firth from Lossiemouth after an engine caught fire during a post-servicing test flight from RAF Kinloss. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) inquiry identified a number of technical issues as the cause. There were no casualties.
*On 2 September 1995, a Nimrod MR2 XV239 crashed into Lake Ontario while participating in the Canadian International Air Show, killing the seven crew members.
*On 2 September 2006, a Nimrod MR2 XV230 crashed near Kandahar in Afghanistan, killing all 14 servicemen on board – the largest loss of UK military personnel in a single event since the Falklands War. This was the first Nimrod to enter service, originally as an MR1 but upgraded to MR2 standard in the 1980s. On 23 February 2007, the Ministry of Defence grounded all Nimrod MR2s while fuel pumps were inspected, but stressed that the inspection was not necessarily related to this crash.
* On 5 November 2007, XV235 was involved in a midair incident over Afghanistan when the crew noticed a fuel leak during air-to-air refuelling. After transmitting a mayday call, the crew landed the aircraft successfully. The incident came only a month before the issue of the report of a Board of Enquiry into 2 September 2006 fatal accident to XV230 in (likely) similar circumstances. The RAF subsequently suspended air-to-air refuelling operations for this type.

<doc id="40298" wikidata="Q11485" url="?curid=40298" title="Jean-Claude Killy">
<text>Jean-Claude Killy (born 30 August 1943) is a French former World Cup alpine ski racer. He dominated the sport in the late 1960s, and was a triple Olympic champion, winning the three alpine events at the 1968 Winter Olympics, becoming the most successful athlete there. He also won the first two World Cup titles, in 1967 and 1968.

==Early life==
Killy was born in Saint-Cloud, a suburb of Paris, during the German occupation of World War II, but was brought up in Val-d&#x27;Isère in the Alps, where his family had relocated in 1945 following the war. His father, Robert, was a former Spitfire pilot for the Free French, and opened a ski shop in the Savoie village, and would later operate a hotel. In 1950, his mother Madeline abandoned the family for another man, leaving Robert to raise Jean-Claude, age 7, his older sister (France), and their infant brother (Mic). Jean-Claude was sent to boarding school in Chambéry, down the valley, but he despised being shut up in a classroom.

==Early career==
Killy turned his attention to skiing rather than school. His father allowed him to drop out at age 15, and he made the French national junior team a year later. As a young racer, Killy was fast, but did not usually complete his races, and the early 1960s were not entirely successful for him.

In December 1961, at age 18, Killy won his first international race, a giant slalom. The event took place in his home village of Val-d&#x27;Isère. Killy had started 39th, a position that should have been a severe disadvantage.

The French coach picked Killy for the giant slalom in the 1962 World Championships in Chamonix, France, away in the shadow of Mont Blanc. But Killy, unaware of his selection, was still attempting to qualify for the downhill event in northeastern Italy at Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo. Only three weeks before the world championships, he skied in his typical reckless style. About from the finish, Killy hit a stretch of ice in a compression and went down, rose immediately, then crossed the finish on just one ski—and the fastest time. Unfortunately, his other leg was broken, and he watched the 1962 World Championships on crutches.

Two years later, at age 20, Killy was entered in all three of the men&#x27;s events at the 1964 Olympics, because his coach wanted to prepare him for 1968. Unfortunately, Killy was plagued by recurrences of amoebic dysentery and hepatitis, ailments that he had contracted in 1962 during a summer of compulsory service with the French Army in Algeria. His form was definitely off, and he fell a few yards after the start of the downhill, lost a binding in the slalom, and finished fifth in the giant slalom, in which he had been the heavy favorite. Yet a few weeks later, he dominated a giant slalom race at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, in Bavaria, counting for the prestigious Arlberg-Kandahar events, the oldest &#x27;classic&#x27; in the sport. A year later, he also triumphed at another major competition, the slalom of the Hahnenkamm races at Kitzbühel that he clinched three times in a row until 1967.

Although the first half of the decade was a relative disappointment, Killy began to strongly improve his results afterwards to become one of the best technical ski racers. In August 1966, the Frenchman, nicknamed &#x27;Toutoune&#x27; by some of his colleagues and friends, scored his first win in a downhill race against an international field at the 1966 World Championships in Portillo, Chile, and also took gold in the combined. Killy was peaking as the first World Cup season was launched in January 1967, with the 1968 Winter Olympics in France only a year away.

== Dominance – 1967–68 ==

===World Cup results===

====Season standings====
====Season titles====
* 6 titles – (2 overall, 1 DH, 2 GS, 1 SL)
====Race victories====
* 18 wins – (6 DH, 7 GS, 5 SL)
* 24 podiums – (8 DH, 9 GS, 7 SL)

Killy was the first World Cup champion in 1967, winning 12 of 17 races to easily take the overall title. He also won the season standings in each of the three &quot;classic&quot; alpine disciplines; he won all five of the downhill races and four of the five giant slalom races.

The following year, Killy won the triple crown of alpine skiing with a sweep of all three Olympic gold medals (downhill, giant slalom, and slalom) in controversial circumstances at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France. By finishing first in all races, he also captured the FIS world championship title in the combined event.

Electrical timing by Omega was accurate to one-hundredth of a second. Killy relied on his upper-body strength to hit the bar while already moving forward, giving himself a slight edge. This spectacular start appears to have helped him to beat his teammate Guy Perillat by a few hundredths in the Olympic downhill.

With the Olympic events included (for the only time) in the World Cup standings, Killy easily defended his title in 1968 as the overall champion, placing first in the giant slalom and second in the downhill and slalom season standings. He retired following the 1968 season, and moved to Geneva, Switzerland, in 1969.

== Post-Olympic career ==
Killy&#x27;s success in Grenoble could not have come at a more opportune time for him: the 1968 Winter Olympics were the first to be extensively televised, in color, by the American Broadcasting Company. His all-conquering success, combined with his Gallic flair and looks, made him an overnight celebrity in the United States, especially amongst young women. In May 1968, Killy signed with International Management Group, the sports management firm headed by Mark McCormack. After racing on Dynamic VR17 and Rossignol skis during the part of his career when he was dominant, Killy signed a deal with Head Ski in the fall 1968 to endorse a metal and fiberglass ski named for him, the &quot;Killy 800&quot;. Head, which was acquired by AMF the following year, manufactured a line of Killy skis for at least two years.

In April 1969, he was awarded the Helms World Trophy.

In television advertisements, Killy promoted the American Express card. He also became a spokesman for Schwinn bicycles, United Airlines, and Chevrolet automobiles; the last, a role detailed by journalist Hunter S. Thompson in his 1970 article &quot;The Temptations of Jean-Claude Killy&quot; for &quot;Scanlan&#x27;s Monthly&quot;.

Killy starred as a ski instructor in the 1972 crime movie &quot;Snow Job&quot;, released in the UK as &quot;The Ski Raiders&quot;, and US TV as &quot;The Great Ski Caper&quot;. American children in the early 1970s knew Killy from a TV commercial where he introduces himself, his thick accent making his name into &quot;Chocolate Kitty.&quot; Killy played himself in the 1983 movie Copper Mountain: A Club Med Experience, starring Jim Carrey and Alan Thicke, set at Copper Mountain, Colorado. Killy also stars in the noteworthy TV movie Peggy Fleming at Sun Valley (1971), in which he performs some remarkable skiing tricks alongside the three-time ice skating World Champion Peggy Fleming.
Jean-Claude Killy also had a short career as a racing driver between 1967 and 1970, participating in several car races including at Monza. Killy entered the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1969, partnered with Bob Wollek, another former skier turned racing driver. Killy and Wollek&#x27;s car led its class for a while before pulling out of the race with only four hours to go. In team with fellow Frenchman Bernard Cahier, Killy was 7th overall in the 1967 Targa Florio in a Porsche 911 S and first in the GT classification.

In November 1972, Killy came out of ski racing retirement at age 29 to compete on the pro circuit in the U.S. for two seasons. After a spirited challenge from two-time defending champion Spider Sabich, Killy won the 1973 season title, taking $28,625 in race winnings and a $40,000 bonus for the championship.
He missed the next season, won by Hugo Nindl, due to a recurring stomach ailment, then returned in the fall of 1974. Injuries slowed him and he finished well out of the 1975 standings, won by Hank Kashiwa.

In addition to trying his skill as a car racer, Killy made two television series. One, &quot;The Killy Style&quot;, was a thirteen-week series that showcased various ski resorts, and the other, &quot;The Killy Challenge&quot;, featured him racing against celebrities, who were all given handicaps. He was also sponsored by a champagne company, Moët &amp; Chandon, which paid him to be seen with a bottle of their champagne on his table everywhere he went.
In 1974 Killy, as part of this sponsorship deal was paid to ski down the previously unskied eastern slope of Mt Ngauruhoe (Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Mt Doom&quot;) in New Zealand. The average slope on this side of the active volcano is 35 degrees. Radar recorded his speed at over , and it took two takes, as cloud cover spoiled the first.

In 1975, Killy was hired to lead the new ski operations at Shawnee Mountain Ski Area, a resort in the foothills of the Pocono Mountains in northeastern Pennsylvania. In 1983, Bob Gillen wrote in &quot;Ski&quot; magazine about the growing reputation of Shawnee Mountain as a ski area. He stated, &quot;Some of the initial interest was stimulated by hiring Jean-Claude Killy to represent the facility, and for several seasons he spent a number of days there. The first time my wife ever skied with me, I saw Killy flash by at Shawnee—he was fast and smooth and he stopped frequently to check the time on his Rolex.&quot;

From 1977 to 1994, he was a member of the Executive board of the Alpine Skiing Committee of the FIS. Killy served as co-president of the 1992 Winter Olympics, held in Albertville, France, and as the President of the Société du Tour de France cycling race between 1992 and 2001. From 1995 to 2014, he was a member of the International Olympic Committee and chaired the coordination committee for Turin 2006 and Sochi 2014. He has been an Honorary Member since then.

Killy tried his hand at distance running and competed in the 1983 New York City Marathon, finishing in 3:58:33.

The ski area of Val-d&#x27;Isère and Tignes in the French Alps was given the name l&#x27;Espace Killy, in his honor.

Killy became Grand Officer of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 2000.

Intrawest credits Killy with the design of a ski trail, &quot;Cupp Run&quot;, at their Snowshoe resort in West Virginia.

== Personal life ==
From 1973 to 1987, he was married to French actress Danielle Gaubert, until her death from cancer. Together they had a daughter, Émilie; he also adopted her two children from her first marriage to Rhadamés Trujillo, the son of Rafael Trujillo, the assassinated dictator of the Dominican Republic. Gaubert and Trujillo were divorced in 1968 and later that year she met Killy. He is known for being friends with Russian President, Vladimir Putin. In an interview for the 1972 documentary Elvis on Tour, Elvis Presley named Jean-Claude as his favorite skier.

<text>William Hale Thompson (May 14, 1869 – March 19, 1944) was an American politician who served as mayor of Chicago from 1915 to 1923 and again from 1927 to 1931. Known as &quot;Big Bill&quot;, he is the most recent Republican to have served as mayor of Chicago. Historians rank him among the most unethical mayors in American history, mainly for his open alliance with Al Capone. However, others recognize the effectiveness of his political methods and publicity-oriented campaigning, acknowledging him as a &quot;Political Chameleon&quot; and the leader of an effective political machine.

Thompson was known for his over-the-top campaigning and uncensored language that, along with his towering height and weight, earned him the nickname &quot;Big Bill&quot;. Upon his reelection in 1927, Thompson had the school board suspend the Superintendent of Chicago Public Schools, William McAndrew. He was also at the forefront of the movement for the Chicago Public Library system and education officials to censor and ban many texts and historical recollections coming from the United Kingdom.

Though Thompson was a popular figure during his career, his popularity collapsed after his death, when two safe-deposit boxes were found in his name containing over $1.8 million, which were taken as evidence of his corruption.

==Early life==
Thompson was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to William Hale and Medora Gale Thompson, but his family moved to Chicago when he was nine days old. Despite having been born in Boston, Thompson had strong roots in Chicago. His father, Colonel William Hale Thompson Sr., was a popular businessman within Chicago and had served as colonel in the Second Illinois Guard who had come to Chicago after serving in the United States Navy during the American Civil War. His maternal grandfather, Stephen F. Gale, the first chief of the Chicago Fire Department, had played a large part in drawing up the city&#x27;s corporation charter in 1837, earning him regard as a &quot;Chicago pioneer&quot; by some academic journalists.

Thompson attended Chicago Public Schools, and took supplementary courses at the Fessenden School and Metropolitan College.

Thompson was meant to attend Yale but instead moved to Wyoming at the age of 14, where he became a cowboy and cattle owner and traveled across Europe, taking up ranching in Texas and New Mexico later on in his life. The experiences influenced him to add Western touches into his campaign, including his sombrero, which became a symbol for his campaign. By the age of twenty-one, he had accumulated a stake of $30,000. He returned to Chicago in 1892 after his father&#x27;s death to manage his estates. Shortly after returning to Chicago, Thompson joined the Illinois Athletic Club and the Sportsmen&#x27;s Club of America and quickly was appointed director-general and captain of the Chicago Athletic Association&#x27;s water polo and football teams. His six-foot frame and athletic prowess earned him the nickname &quot;Big Bill,&quot; which stuck with him throughout his career as a politician.

==Early political career==
Thompson served on the Real Estate Board of Chicago.

===Chicago City Council===
In 1900, Thompson narrowly won election as an alderman on the Chicago City Council from the 2nd Ward, his home district. 

In 1901, Thompson declared himself a candidate for the Republican mayoral nomination, though he ultimately did not contest at the convention.

===Cook County Board of Commissioners===
In 1902, Thompson was elected to the Cook County Board of Commissioners, serving from 1902 through 1904. During this period, Thompson formed a political alliance with Frederick Lundin, a Republican city clerk who worked under William Lorimer, a U.S. Representative from Illinois who was known for corrupt election methods. The political duo, according to most citizens, worked very well together earning them the title the &quot;Gallagher and Shean of Chicago Politics&quot;. Thompson with his outgoing and charismatic personality paired with his towering stature and gentlemanly appearance gave him an undeniable public presence, which was completed by Lundin&#x27;s cunning political ideas and projects.

==First mayoralty (1915–1923)==
===First term===

In 1915, Thompson was elected as the 41st Mayor of Chicago, beating County Clerk Robert M. Sweitzer, John H. Hill, Seymour Steadman, and Charles Thompson.

Thompson was sworn in on April 26, 1915. In his inaugural address, Thompson spoke of his ambitions for Chicago to become &quot;the greatest in the world&quot;, but also that his acts as mayor should not be swayed by corruption. He also emphasized the importance of public safety (as enforced by the Chicago Police Department), the improvement of public transit, secure and permanently lowered gas prices, Chicago being allowed to have Home rule and more efforts being placed into Chicago&#x27;s commercial interests in order to create jobs and improve the city&#x27;s economy. His efforts to expand and publicly improve the streets of Chicago earned him another nickname of &quot;Big Bill the Builder&quot;. In his time as mayor, he oversaw the completion of the Michigan Avenue link bridge, the Twelfth Street widening, and the extension and widening of Ogden Avenue. Along with his big dreams for Chicago&#x27;s geographical expansion, he wished for Chicago to expand politically and economically. He believed that Chicago should be able to enforce laws on their own terms, particularly without what he claimed to be the interference of British government or totalitarian rule. He ended his inaugural address by declaring, 

As Thompson entered the first term of his mayorship, he appointed Fred Lundin as chairman on the committee of patronage. Early in his mayoral career, Thompson began to amass a war chest to support an eventual run for the presidency, by charging city drivers and inspectors $3 per month.

Early in his mayoralty Thompson had to cut short a July 1915 trip to San Francisco in order to deal with the aftermath of the &quot;Eastland&quot; disaster. While Thompson was out of town, acting-mayor Moorhouse had turned the Chicago City Hall into a makeshift hospital for first aid and a morgue for bodies recovered from the tragedy. Once Thompson returned to Chicago he organized and heavily promoted a relief fund and ordered an investigation into the casual negligence responsible for the tragedy.

In 1915, a delegation of civic-oriented women, headed by Mary McDowell, urged Thompson to appoint an well-qualified woman to the city&#x27;s new office of &quot;commissioner of public welfare&quot;. Thompson did appoint a woman. However, instead of a woman qualified by a public welfare background, he appointed Louise Osborn Rowe, a Republican Party worker and loyalist. Within a year of her appointment, Rowe was charged with operating a kickback scheme in the department, and was forced to resign in 1916. This post would remain vacant until the mayoralty of Thompson&#x27;s successor.

Thompson gained national attention and condemnation for his neutral attitude toward the events of World War I. By declining the visit of the French Mission to Chicago and refusing to control or act against anti-war or anti-conscription meetings, Thompson is &quot;credited with characterizing Chicago as the sixth German city of the world,&quot; also earning the nickname &quot;Kaiser&quot; Bill Thompson. Thompson sought to further endear himself to the city&#x27;s German and Irish populations by positioning himself as anti-British. Thompson opposed sending troops into war after the United States&#x27; April 1917 declaration of war. These facts later went on to hurt his chances in his 1918 U.S. Senate campaign.

In 1916, he became a member of the Republican National Committee. He would continue to serve on the committee until 1920.

===Second term===
Thompson was reelected mayor in 1919, beating out Robert Sweitzer once again along with Adolph S. Carm, John Collins, John Fitzpatrick, and Maclay Hoyne. Thompson was said to have had control of the 75,000 black voters in his day. In his campaign he claimed to be an advocate for the people against public utility companies and the rich who avoided taxes. This inspired Thompson to enforce a five-cent streetcar fare to promote his campaign, which was also used to threaten the action of streetcar companies; he also sued the Chicago &quot;L&quot; when it tried to raise fares after the inflation caused by World War I. Eventually, however, despite his protests, the fare was raised to seven cents.

In his second inaugural address on April 28, 1919, Thompson looked towards drastically expanding Chicago, saying that &quot;Chicago is greater than some nations&quot;. This expansion included the extension and widening of streets to cross over more of the city, new post offices, freight terminals, playgrounds, bridges, and more. Also, due to the rapidly changing city, Thompson proposed a zoning bill to regulate and create commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Among the other issues he claimed he would address were telephone prices and service quality, the expansion of the Chicago Police Department, jobs for returning soldiers, lowering the cost of living, and restoring the jobs of Public School representatives who were removed by the Supreme Court.

In 1922, the city council voted to not spend any money to enforce the Volstead Act]. Early into his second term, the city dealt with the Chicago race riot of 1919.

At the 1920 Republican National Convention Thompson helped to block his one-time ally Frank Lowden from capturing the nomination.

Thompson declined to run for reelection in 1923 and he was succeeded by William Emmett Dever. Thompson left office as Mayor on April 16, 1923.

==Chairman of the Illinois Waterways Commission==
While out of office, Thompson was appointed chairman of the Illinois Waterways Commission. He used his position to remain relevant in the media, involving himself in civic suits and campaigning for the Lakes-to-Gulf waterway project: to build a waterway from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. Promoting both the project and himself, Thompson set off on a &quot;scientific&quot; expedition (to be extensively covered by the media), which he set off to the South Seas in order to find a tree-climbing fish on July 5, 1924. Attracting more attention, Thompson placed a $25,000 bet on his success, but no one participated.

==Second mayoralty (1927–1931)==
Thompson ran again in 1927 during a citywide gang war, aiming to unseat his successor, William Dever. Always a flamboyant campaigner, Thompson held a primary-election debate between himself and two live rats which he used to portray his opponents. Pledging to clean up Chicago and remove the crooks, Thompson instead turned his attention to the reformers, whom he considered the real criminals. According to Thompson, the biggest enemy the United States had was King George V of the United Kingdom. Thompson promised his supporters, many of whom were Irish, that if they ever met, Thompson would punch the king in the nose, or at other times, that he would arrest His Majesty. Upon his victory over Dever, Thompson&#x27;s floating speakeasy, outwardly known as the Fish Fans Club, docked at Belmont Harbor. It was flooded with his supporters, so many so that the boat itself sank beneath the weight.

In his inaugural address on April 18, 1927, Thompson addressed the importance of remedying crime in Chicago, saying,

Thompson expressed his desire to remove Superintendent William McAndrew from the public schooling system, and restore what he called the &quot;true history of George Washington&quot; while exposing &quot;the treason and propaganda which insidiously have been injected into our schools and other educational institutions&quot;. He also went on to enforce other issues he had addressed in previous speeches, like the issue of public transit, playgrounds, and the general upkeep and expansion of Chicago in an effort to aid property owners and increase residential income and revenue for the city as a whole. In August 1927, the Chicago Board of Education, now under Thompson&#x27;s influence after he appointed a number of new members, voted to charge McAndrew with insubordination and lack of patriotism, suspending him pending an administrative hearing held by the board. The administrative hearing would last months, and the Chicago Board of Education would find McAndrew guilty. The Cook County Superior Court would later void this decision.

Al Capone&#x27;s support was pivotal to Thompson&#x27;s return to the mayor&#x27;s office. Capone raised over $200,000 for Thompsons&#x27;s 1927 campaign.
During Thompson&#x27;s second term, the &quot;Pineapple Primary&quot; took place on April 10, 1928, so-called because of the hand grenades thrown at polling places to disrupt voting. The Pineapple Primary saw candidates backed by Thompson face Charles Deneen in the Republican primary election. Another infamous instance of gang activity that took place during Thompson&#x27;s third term was St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre.

Thompson blamed Ruth Hanna McCormick&#x27;s lack of support for his loss at the 1928 Republican National Convention, and he returned the favor during her 1930 campaign for the United States Senate by endorsing against her in the general election. Thompson had had a longstanding rivalry with the McCormicks. He intensely disliked Robert R. McCormick who published the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. U.S. Senator Medill McCormick was the publisher&#x27;s brother, and Ruth Hanna McCormick was Medill McCormick&#x27;s wife.

Amid growing discontent with Thompson&#x27;s leadership, particularly in the area of cleaning up Chicago&#x27;s reputation as the capital of organized crime, he was defeated in 1931 by Democrat Anton Cermak. Cermak was an immigrant from Bohemia, and Thompson used this fact to belittle him with ethnic slurs such as:
Cermak replied, &quot;He doesn&#x27;t like my name...It&#x27;s true I didn&#x27;t come over on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, but I came over as soon as I could,&quot; which was a sentiment to which ethnic Chicagoans (especially its large Bohemian population) could relate, so Thompson&#x27;s slurs largely backfired. Al Capone reportedly donated $260,000 to Thompson&#x27;s failed 1931 election.

After Thompson&#x27;s defeat, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote, 

Thompson left office April 9, 1931.

==Subsequent career==
In 1936, Thompson ran for the office of Illinois governor on the &quot;Union Progressive&quot; ballot line against Democratic incumbent Henry Horner and Republican nominee C. Wayland Brooks. He received only three percent of the vote. In 1939, Thompson ran in the Republican primary for mayor of Chicago and was soundly defeated by a 77% to 23% margin against future Governor Dwight Green.

==Personal life==
In 1901, Thompson married Mary &quot;Maysie&quot; Walker Wyse, a secretary in his father&#x27;s office. The two never had children. In 1930 his wife was robbed at gunpoint by George &quot;Baby Face&quot; Nelson, taking jewellery valued at $18,000. She described her attacker, saying &quot;He had a baby face. He was good looking, hardly more than a boy, had dark hair and was wearing a gray topcoat and a brown felt hat, turned down brim.&quot; This description earned Nelson the baby face moniker.

===Death===
William Hale Thompson died on March 19, 1944, at the Blackstone Hotel at the age of 74. He was buried in Oak Woods Cemetery in a solid bronze casket.

Despite the fact that many had liked Thompson and enjoyed his various political antics, few people attended his funeral, and one reporter noted that there was not &quot;a flower nor a fern to be seen&quot;.

Upon Thompson&#x27;s death, two safe deposit boxes in his name were discovered to contain nearly $1.84 million ($ million today) in cash. Once the money was uncovered, the Internal Revenue Service took its share in taxes, and Maysie Thompson lived off of the rest until her death in 1958.
==Historical assessments==
Historians rank him among the most unethical mayors in American history, mainly for his open alliance with Al Capone. However, others recognize the effectiveness of his political methods and publicity-oriented campaigning, acknowledging him as a &quot;Political Chameleon&quot; and an effective political machine. &quot;Time&quot; magazine said in 1931, &quot;chief credit for creating 20th Century Politics Chicago Style&quot; should go to William Thompson.

A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Thompson as the worst American big-city mayor to have served between 1820 and 1993.

<text>Anton Joseph Cermak (May 9, 1873 – March 6, 1933) was an American politician who served as the 44th Mayor of Chicago from April 7, 1931, until his death in 1933. He was killed by Giuseppe Zangara, whose likely target was President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt, but Cermak was shot instead after a bystander hit the perpetrator with a purse.

==Early life==

Anton Joseph Cermak was born to a mining family in Kladno, Austria-Hungary (now in the Czech Republic), the son of Antonín Čermák and Kateřina née Frank(ová).

He immigrated with his parents to the United States in 1874, and grew up in the town of Braidwood, Illinois, where he was educated before beginning to work full time while still a teenager. He followed his father into coal mining, and labored at mines in Will and Grundy counties. After moving to Chicago at age 16, Cermak worked as a tow boy for the horse-drawn streetcar line, and then tended horses in the stables of Chicago&#x27;s Pilsen neighborhood. During the early years of his working life, Cermak supplemented his education with evening high school and business college classes.

==Early career==
After saving enough money to buy his own horse and cart, he went into business selling firewood, and he subsequently expanded his venture into a haulage business. As he became more politically active, Cermak served in municipal government jobs, including as a clerk in the city police court, and as a bailiff for the Municipal Court of Chicago. As his political fortunes began to rise, Cermak was able to avail himself of other business opportunities, including interests in real estate, insurance, and banking.

Cermak began his political career as a Democratic Party precinct captain, and in 1902, he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives. Seven years later, in 1909 he was elected to the Chicago City Council as an alderman of the 12th Ward. He was re-elected in 1911. In December 1912, he resigned from the city council in order to accept a position as bailiff of the Chicago Municipal Court. In 1918, Cermak unsuccessfully ran as the Democratic nominee for Cook County sheriff. He narrowly lost to Republican nominee Charles W. Peters.

Cermak was elected in 1919 to again represent the 12th ward on the city council, and was re-elected in 1921. He was elected president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners in 1922, and resigned from the city council in order to assume office as county president on December 4. He was elected the chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party in 1928. Also in 1928, he was the Democratic nominee for a seat in the United States Senate, but was defeated by Republican Otis F. Glenn, 54.46% to 44.94%.

==Mayor of Chicago (1931–1933)==

Cermak won election as mayor of Chicago in 1931. His mayoral victory came in the wake of the Great Depression, the deep resentment many Chicagoans had of Prohibition, and the increasing violence resulting from organized crime&#x27;s control of Chicago—typified by the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre.

The many ethnic groups, such as Czechs, Poles, Ukrainians, Jews, Italians, and African Americans, who began to settle in Chicago in the early 1900s were mostly detached from the political system, due in part to a lack of organization, which led to underrepresentation in the City Council. As an immigrant himself, Cermak recognized Chicago&#x27;s relatively new immigrants as a significant population of disenfranchised voters, which had the potential to be a large power base for Cermak and his local Democratic organization.

Before Cermak, the Democratic party in Cook County was run by Irish Americans. The Irish first became successful in politics since they spoke English, and because, coming from an island on the edge of Europe, they had few ancestral enemies. As the old saying went: &quot;A Lithuanian won’t vote for a Pole, and a Pole won’t vote for a Lithuanian. A German won’t vote for either of them. But all three will vote for a turkey—an Irishman.&quot; As Cermak climbed the local political ladder, the resentment of the party leadership grew. When the bosses rejected his bid to become the mayoral candidate, Cermak swore revenge. He formed his political army from the non-Irish elements.

Cermak&#x27;s political and organizational skills helped create one of the most influential political organizations of his day. With support from Franklin D. Roosevelt on the national level, Cermak gradually wooed members of Chicago&#x27;s growing black community into the Democratic fold. Walter Wright, the superintendent of parks and aviation for the city of Chicago, aided Cermak in stepping into office.

When Cermak challenged the incumbent, William Hale &quot;Big Bill&quot; Thompson, in the 1931 mayor&#x27;s race, Thompson, who represented Chicago&#x27;s existing Irish-dominated power structure, responded with an ethnic slur–filled ditty that ridiculed his teamster past (pushing a pushcart):

:&quot;I won’t take a back seat to that Bohunk, Chairmock, Chermack, or whatever his name is.&quot;
:&quot;Tony, Tony, where’s your pushcart at?&quot;
:&quot;Can you picture a World’s Fair mayor with a name like that?&quot;

Cermak replied, &quot;He doesn’t like my name… it’s true I didn’t come over on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, but I came over as soon as I could.&quot; It was a sentiment to which ethnic Chicagoans could relate, and Thompson&#x27;s prejudicial insults largely backfired.

Thompson&#x27;s reputation as a buffoon, many voters’ disgust with the corruption of his political machine, and his inability or unwillingness to clean up organized crime in Chicago were cited as major factors in Cermak capturing 58% of the vote in the mayoral election on April 6, 1931. Cermak&#x27;s victory finished Thompson as a political power, and largely ended the Republican Party&#x27;s influence in Chicago; indeed, all the mayors of Chicago since 1931 have been members of the Democratic Party. For nearly his entire administration, Cermak had to deal with a major tax revolt. From 1931 to 1933, the Association of Real Estate Taxpayers mounted a &quot;tax strike.&quot;

At its height, the association, which was headed by John M. Pratt and James E. Bistor, had over 30,000 members. Much to Cermak&#x27;s dismay, it successfully slowed down the collection of real estate taxes through litigation and the promotion of the refusal to pay. In the meantime, the city found it difficult to pay teachers and maintain services. Cermak had to meet President-elect Roosevelt to &quot;mend fences,&quot; and to request money to fund essential city services.

A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Cermak as the twenty-fifth-best American big-city mayor to have served between the years 1820 and 1993.

==Death==

On February 15, 1933, while shaking hands with President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt at Bayfront Park in Miami, Florida, Cermak was shot in the lung and mortally wounded by Giuseppe Zangara, who was attempting to assassinate Roosevelt. At the critical moment, Lillian Cross, a woman standing near Zangara, hit Zangara&#x27;s arm with her purse, and spoiled his aim. In addition to Cermak, Zangara hit four other people: Margaret Kruis, 21, of Newark, NJ, shot through the hand; Russell Caldwell, 22, of Miami, hit squarely in the forehead by a spent bullet, which embedded itself under the skin; Mabel Gill of Miami, shot in the abdomen; and William Sinnott, a New York police detective, who received a glancing blow to the forehead and scalp. All four of those injuries were minor.

Once at the hospital, Cermak reportedly uttered the line that was engraved on his tomb, saying to Roosevelt, &quot;I&#x27;m glad it was me, not you.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported the quote without attributing it to a witness, and most scholars doubt that it was ever said.

Zangara told the police that he hated rich and powerful people, but not Roosevelt personally. Later, rumors circulated that Cermak, not Roosevelt, had been the intended target, as his promise to clean up Chicago&#x27;s rampant lawlessness posed a threat to Al Capone and the Chicago organized crime syndicate. One of the first people to suggest the organized crime theory was reporter Walter Winchell, who happened to be in Miami the evening of the shooting. According to Roosevelt biographer Jean Edward Smith, there is no proof for this theory.

Long-time Chicago newsman Len O’Connor offers a different view of the events surrounding the mayor&#x27;s assassination. He has written that aldermen Paddy Bauler and Charlie Weber informed him that relations between Cermak and Roosevelt were strained, because Cermak fought Roosevelt&#x27;s nomination at the Democratic convention in Chicago.

Author Ronald Humble provides yet another perspective as to why Cermak was killed. In his book &quot;Frank Nitti: The True Story of Chicago’s Notorious Enforcer&quot;, Humble contends that Cermak was as corrupt as Thompson, and that the Chicago Outfit hired Zangara to kill Cermak in retaliation for Cermak&#x27;s attempt to murder Frank Nitti.

Cermak died at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami on March 6, partly due to his wounds. On March 30, however, his personal physician, Dr. Karl A. Meyer, revealed that the primary cause of Cermak&#x27;s death was ulcerative colitis, commenting, &quot;The mayor would have recovered from the bullet wound had it not been for the complication of colitis. The autopsy disclosed the wound had healed ... the other complications were not directly due to the bullet wound.&quot; Doubts were raised at the time and later concerning whether the bullet wound directly contributed to his death. A theory raised decades later contended that the bullet had actually caused damage to his colon which led to perforation which was undiagnosed by his doctors. It alleged that &quot;but for [the] physicians&#x27; blunders&quot; Cermak might have survived. This theory was refuted by a later medical analysis of the event.

Zangara was convicted of murder after Cermak&#x27;s death under the law of transferred intent, and was executed in Florida&#x27;s electric chair on March 20, 1933.

Cermak was interred in a mausoleum at the Bohemian National Cemetery in Chicago. The mayor&#x27;s death was followed by a struggle for succession both to his party chairmanship, and for the mayor&#x27;s office.

A plaque honoring Cermak still lies at the site of the assassination in Miami&#x27;s Bayfront Park. It is inscribed with Cermak&#x27;s alleged words to Roosevelt after he was shot, &quot;I&#x27;m glad it was me instead of you.&quot; Following Cermak&#x27;s death, 22nd Street—a major east–west artery that traversed Chicago&#x27;s West Side, and the close-in suburbs of Cicero and Berwyn, areas with significant Czech populations—was renamed Cermak Road. In 1943, a Liberty ship, the SS &quot;A. J. Cermak&quot; was named in Cermak&#x27;s honor. It was scrapped in 1964.

==Descendants==
Cermak&#x27;s son-in-law, Otto Kerner Jr., served as the 33rd Governor of Illinois, and as a federal circuit judge.

His grandson, Frank J. Jirka, Jr., who was with him in Miami when he was assassinated, later became an Underwater Demolition Team officer in the United States Navy. Jirka was awarded a Silver Star and Purple Heart for his actions during the Battle of Iwo Jima; the wounds he suffered led to the amputation of both legs below the knee. After World War II, he became a physician, and in 1983, was elected president of the American Medical Association. Cermak&#x27;s great niece, Kajon Cermak, is a radio broadcaster. His daughter, Lillian, was married to Richey V. Graham, who served in the Illinois General Assembly.

== In popular culture ==
* A hastily produced movie about Cermak, &quot;The Man Who Dared,&quot; was released within months of his death.
* There was a made-for-TV movie, &quot;The Gun of Zangara,&quot; about Cermak&#x27;s assassination. It was originally a two-part episode of &quot;The Untouchables,&quot; where it had the title &quot;The Unhired Assassin.&quot; Cermak had a major role in the story as an honest man, and was played by Robert Middleton.
* Cermak is mentioned in Stephen Sondheim’s play &quot;Assassins&quot; during the song &quot;How I Saved Roosevelt.&quot;
* Cermak and his rise to the mayoralty has also been mentioned in Jeffrey Archer’s novel &quot;Kane and Abel&quot;.
* Part of the episode &quot;Objects in Motion&quot; of the television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot; is based on the circumstances of Cermak’s death.
* Cermak is referenced by Kelsey Grammer’s fictional Chicago mayor, Tom Kane, in several episodes of the Starz TV series &quot;Boss&quot;.
* In &quot;Red Team III,&quot; the seventh episode in the second season of HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Newsroom&quot;, Will McAvoy (Jeff Daniels) references Anton Cermak.
* The history-based crime novel &quot;True Detective&quot;, the first in Max Allan Collins&#x27; Nathan Heller series, includes a fictionalized account of the Cermak slaying.
* In the first episode of the second season of &quot;F Is for Family&quot;, an adult animated sitcom produced for Netflix, the fictional school of Anton Cermak Tech is mentioned during a broadcast.
* In &quot;The Untouchables&quot; TV series (1993–1994), Cermak is assassinated by Zangara—a crazy lone gunman targeting FDR—after Ness prevents the assassin they believe was sent by Capone. After the Untouchables return to Chicago, their further investigation reveals a probable third gunman, whose shot actually is responsible for Cermak&#x27;s death, and was a Capone hitman. The first half of the next episode partly involves Ness&#x27; Untouchables identifying the actual gunman (a Capone hitman named Charlie Ross), who goes into hiding after a raid by the Untouchables. As the Untouchables arrange to bring him in for testimony, he is gunned down, thereby forever silencing the truth about the mob killing the mayor.

<doc id="40304" wikidata="Q295390" url="?curid=40304" title="Jane Byrne">
<text>Jane Margaret Byrne (née Burke; May 24, 1933November 14, 2014) was an American politician who served as the 50th mayor of Chicago from April 16, 1979, until April 29, 1983. Prior to her tenure as mayor, Byrne served as Chicago&#x27;s commissioner of consumer sales from 1969 until 1977, the only female in the mayoral cabinet. 

Byrne won the 1979 Chicago mayoral election on April 3, 1979 becoming the first female mayor of the city, and causing an upheaval in beating the city&#x27;s political machine. She was the first woman to be elected mayor of a major city in the United States, as Chicago was the second largest city in the United States at the time. She narrowly lost her bid for reelection in the Democratic primary for the 1983 Chicago mayoral election. Again, after trying for the party nomination in 1987, she threw her support to Harold Washington.

==Early life and career==
Byrne was born Jane Margaret Burke on May 24, 1933, at John B. Murphy Hospital in the Lake View neighborhood on the north side of Chicago, Illinois, to Katherine Marie Burke (née Nolan), a housewife, and William Patrick Burke, vice president of Inland Steel. Raised on the city&#x27;s north side, Byrne graduated from Saint Scholastica High School and attended St. Mary of the Woods for her first year of college. Byrne later transferred to Barat College, where she graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry and biology in 1955. 

Byrne entered politics to volunteer in John F. Kennedy&#x27;s campaign for president in 1960. During that campaign she first met then Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley. After Daley met Byrne, he appointed her to several positions, beginning in 1964 with a job in a city anti-poverty program In June 1965, she was promoted to working with the Chicago Committee of Urban Opportunity.

In 1968, Byrne was appointed head of the City of Chicago&#x27;s consumer affairs department. She served as a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention (DNC) and chairperson of the DNC resolutions committee in 1973. In 1975, Byrne was appointed co-chairperson of the Cook County Democratic Central Committee by Daley, over the objection of a majority of Democratic leaders. The committee ousted Byrne shortly after Daley&#x27;s death in late 1976. Shortly thereafter, Byrne accused the newly appointed mayor Michael Bilandic of being unfair to citizens of the city by approving an increase in regulated taxi fares, which Byrne charged was the result of a &quot;backroom deal&quot;. Byrne was then dismissed from her post as head of consumer affairs by Bilandic.

==Mayor of Chicago (1979–1983)==
===1979 election===
Months after being fired as head of the consumer affairs department, Byrne challenged Bilandic in the 1979 Democratic mayoral primary, the real contest in the heavily Democratic Chicago. Officially announcing her mayoral campaign in August 1977, Byrne partnered with Chicago journalist and political consultant Don Rose, who served as her campaign manager. At first, political observers believed she had little chance of winning. A memorandum inside the Bilandic campaign said it should portray her as &quot;a shrill, charging, vindictive person—and nothing makes a woman look worse&quot;. 

Nevertheless, the January Chicago Blizzard of 1979 paralyzed the city and caused Bilandic to be seen as an ineffective leader. Bilandic&#x27;s ineffective leadership caused Jesse Jackson to endorse Byrne. Even many Republican voters voted in the Democratic primary to help beat Bilandic. Infuriated voters on the North Side and Northwest Side retaliated against Bilandic for the Democratic Party&#x27;s slating of only South Side candidates for the mayor, clerk, and treasurer (the outgoing city clerk, John C. Marcin, was from the Northwest Side). These four factors combined to give Byrne a 51% to 49% victory over Bilandic in the primary. Positioning herself as a reformer, Byrne then won the main election with 82.1% of the vote, still the largest margin in a Chicago mayoral election.

===Tenure===
====Leadership and general politics====
Byrne made inclusive moves as mayor such as shepherding the hiring of the city&#x27;s first African-American and female school superintendent Ruth B. Love, and she was the first mayor to recognize the gay community. Byrne helped to make Chicago more welcoming to the gay community. She ended the police department&#x27;s practice of raiding gay bars, and declared the city&#x27;s first official &quot;Gay Pride Parade Day&quot; in 1981. However, during her tenure, Byrne drifted away from many of the progressive tenets she had campaigned on. Byrne began to collaborate with aldermen Edward M. Burke and Edward Vrdolyak, whom, during her 1979 campaign, she had denounced as an &quot;evil cabal&quot;.

In 1982, she supported the Cook County Democratic Party&#x27;s replacement of its chairman, County Board President George Dunne, with her city council ally, Alderman Edward Vrdolyak.

Byrne and the Cook County Democratic Party endorsed Senator Ted Kennedy for president in the 1980 Democratic presidential primaries, but incumbent President Jimmy Carter won the Illinois Democratic Primary and even carried Cook County and the city of Chicago. Byrne&#x27;s endorsement of Kennedy was later considered detrimental because of her controversial tenure, and Kennedy&#x27;s loss in the city was a key moment in the 1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries because of Chicago&#x27;s role in delivering his brother John F. Kennedy the 1960 Democratic presidential nomination. When Byrne and Kennedy walked in the annual Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parade they were sometimes booed by hecklers.

Simultaneously, Byrne and the Cook County Democratic Party&#x27;s candidate in the 1980 election for Cook County State&#x27;s Attorney (chief local prosecutor), 14th Ward Alderman Edward M. Burke, lost in the Democratic primary to Richard M. Daley, and Daley then unseated GOP incumbent Bernard Carey in the general election.

The &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; reported that Byrne&#x27;s enemies publicly mocked her as &quot;that crazy broad&quot; and &quot;that skinny bitch&quot; and worse.

====Appointments and personnel====
In her first year in office, significant instances of turnover in prominent city positions led critics to accuse Byrne of running a &quot;revolving door administration&quot;.

While Byrne initially made inclusive moves with regards to appointments as mayor: shepherding the hiring of the city&#x27;s first African-American and female school superintendent Ruth B. Love which she later pivoted away from this. Among the later steps that Byrne took that upset many of the progressives and Blacks that had supported her in the 1979 mayoral campaign was replacing Black members of the Chicago Board of Education and Chicago Housing Authority board with White members, some of whom even held stances that critics viewed as racist.

During the 1979 mayoral election, Byrne pledged to fire Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department James E. O&#x27;Grady, accusing him of having &quot;politicized&quot; the department. Days after her inauguration, O&#x27;Grady resigned. Later that year, she relieved interim superintendent Joseph DiLeonardi of command. She appointed Samuel Nolan interim superintendent in his place, Nolan was the first African American to serve as head of the Chicago Police Department. In January 1980, Richard J. Brzeczek took office as permanent superintendent, having been appointed by Byrne. On her last day in office, after the resignation of Brzeczek as superintdendent, Byrne appointed James E. O&#x27;Grady as interim superintendent. By this time, Byrne had rescinded her past criticisms of O&#x27;Grady. In 1980, Byrne appointed William R. Blair as Chicago fire commissioner.

====Arts====
During her campaign for mayor, Byrne promised to provide strong support to the performing arts. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; art critic, Richard Christiansen, hailed Byrne for having made, &quot;the arts and amusements of the city a most significant part of her&quot; mayoral administration.

As mayor, she provided $200,000 to the Lyric Opera of Chicago for the express purposes of providing family-friendly entertainment. She provided a similar amount to Auditorium Theatre for them to acquire a new lighting board. As mayor, Byrne funded the construction of the &quot;Miró&#x27;s Chicago&quot; sculpture by artist Joan Miró. Byrne also allowed Chicago to be used as a filming location, pushing for such movies as &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; to be shot in Chicago.

==== Cabrini–Green ====
On March 26, 1981, Byrne decided to move into the crime-ridden Cabrini–Green Homes housing project on the near-north side of Chicago after 37 shootings resulting in 11 murders occurring during a three-month period from January to March 1981. In her 2004 memoir, Byrne reflected on her decision to move into Cabrini–Green: &quot;How could I put Cabrini on a bigger map? ... Suddenly I knew—I could move in there.&quot; Prior to her move to Cabrini, Byrne closed down several liquor stores in the area, citing the stores as hangout for gangs and murderers. Byrne also ordered the Chicago Housing Authority to evict tenants who were suspected of harboring gang members in their apartments, which affected approximately 800 tenants. 

Byrne moved into a 4th floor apartment in a Cabrini extension building on North Sedgwick Avenue with her husband on March 31 around 8:30 p.m. after attending a dinner at the Conrad Hilton hotel. Hours after Byrne moved into the housing project, police raided the building and arrested eleven street gang members who they had learned through informants were planning to have a shootout in the mayor&#x27;s building later that evening. 

Byrne described her first night at Cabrini-Green as &quot;lovely&quot; and &quot;very quiet&quot;. She stayed at Cabrini-Green for three weeks to bring attention to the housing project&#x27;s crime and infrastructure problems. Her stay there ended on April 18, 1981, following an Easter celebration at the project which drew protests and demonstrators who claimed Byrne&#x27;s move to the project was just a publicity stunt.

====Finances====
One of the crises that Byrne faced in her first year as mayor was a major shortage of funds in both the municipal government and by the Chicago Board of Education (the city&#x27;s school board). This arose due to questionable past borrowing practices, and necessitated both budget cuts and further borrowing to resolve.

====Handgun ordinance====
In January 1982, Byrne proposed a controversial ordinance effectively banning new handgun registration. The ordinance was created to put a freeze on the number of legally owned handguns in Chicago and to require owners of handguns to re-register them annually. The ordinance was approved by a 6–1 vote in February 1982. The ordinance was struck down by the Supreme Court in the 2010 case &quot;McDonald v. City of Chicago&quot;.

====Hosting of special events====
Byrne also used special events, such as ChicagoFest, to revitalize Navy Pier and the downtown Chicago Theatre. ChicagoFest had first been held the year prior to her election. One of Byrne&#x27;s first efforts as mayor had been an attempt to cancel future editions of the event. But, after facing complaints from citizens and unions, Byrne allowed the festival to continue as an annual event, and formally renamed it &quot;Mayor Jane M. Byrne&#x27;s ChicagoFest&quot;. 

Festivals inaugurated during her tenure included Taste of Chicago. Byrne held a number of smaller-scale events in neighborhoods all across the city, wording them with the prefix &quot;Mayor Byrne&#x27;s&quot;. As mayor, Byrne was a strong supporter of the planned Chicago 1992 World&#x27;s Fair. In 1980, Byrne announced that the city would host a Championship Auto Racing Teams &quot;Indy Car&quot; automobile race at Grant Park on the 4th of July weekend of the following year. However, after facing criticism, Byrne quickly canceled these plans.

====Labor====
In her first year in office, she faced strikes by labor unions as the city&#x27;s transit workers, public school teachers, and firefighters all went on strike.

====Transportation====
There had been plans under Daley and Bilandic to demolish the Loop elevated rail and replace it with a subway. Byrne appointed a commission that ultimately recommended that the Loop should be retained along with modernization. In 1981, Byrne disbanded the Chicago Transit Authority&#x27;s dedicated security force, transferring its duties instead to the Chicago Police Department.

====Other matters====
In November 1981, the Chicago City Council approved a new redistricting map for the city&#x27;s aldermanic wards which was drawn by Byrne&#x27;s administration. The U.S. Court of Appeals would find, in 1984, that the map was in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965.

On November 11, 1981, Dan Goodwin, who had successfully climbed the Sears Tower the previous spring, battled for his life on the side of the John Hancock Center. William Blair, Chicago&#x27;s fire commissioner, had ordered the Chicago Fire Department to stop Goodwin by directing a full-power fire hose at him and by using fire axes to break window glass in Goodwin&#x27;s path. 

Mayor Byrne rushed to the scene and ordered the fire department to stand down. Then, through a smashed out a 38th floor window, Byrne told Goodwin, who was hanging from the building&#x27;s side a floor below, that though she did not agree with his climbing of the John Hancock Center, she certainly opposed the fire department knocking him to the ground below. Byrne then allowed Goodwin to continue his climb unimpeded to the top.

Byrne also initiated the idea for creating a unified lakefront museum campus, which was implemented subsequent to her tenure as Museum Campus, as well as the idea of renovating Navy Pier, also implemented subsequent to her tenure. Byrne additionally expanded O&#x27;Hare International Airport.

===Bid for reelection===
In August 1982, Byrne decided that she would seek a second term as mayor. At the beginning of her re-election campaign, she was trailing behind Richard M. Daley, then Cook County State&#x27;s Attorney, by 3% in a poll done by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in July 1982. Compared to the 1979 mayoral election in which Byrne received 59.3% of the African-American vote, Byrne had lost half of that vote. Byrne was defeated in the 1983 Democratic primary for mayor by Harold Washington, also an anti-machine politician and African-American congressman; the younger Daley ran a close third. Washington won the Democratic primary with just 36% of the vote; Byrne had 33%. Washington went on to win the general election.

===Assessments===
A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago saw Byrne ranked as the tenth-worst American big-city mayor to serve between the years 1820 and 1993. When the survey was limited only to mayors that were in office post-1960, the results saw Byrne ranked the fourth-worst.

==Later career==
Byrne ran against Washington again in the 1987 Democratic primary, but was narrowly defeated. She endorsed Washington for the general election, in which he defeated two Democrats running under other parties&#x27; banners (Edward Vrdolyak and Thomas Hynes) and a Republican.

Early into her 1987 campaign, in October 1985, Byrne called for a feasibility study of the potential to construct a third major airport for the city on the site of the South Works. Soon after, Governor James R. Thompson endorsed the idea of immediately planning for a third major airport to serve Chicago. This would be one of the impetuses of decades-long discussions and studies for a third major airport for the city, including the proposed Chicago south suburban airport.

Byrne next ran in the 1988 Democratic primary for Cook County Circuit Court Clerk. She faced the Democratic Party&#x27;s slated candidate, Aurelia Pucinski (who was endorsed by Mayor Washington and is the daughter of then-Alderman Roman Pucinski). Pucinski defeated Byrne in the primary and Vrdolyak, by then a Republican, in the general election. Byrne&#x27;s fourth run for mayor became a rematch with Daley in the 1991 primary. She received only 5.9 percent of the vote, a distant third behind Daley and Alderman Danny K. Davis.

==Personal life==
In 1956, she married William P. Byrne, a U.S. Marine pilot. The couple had a daughter, Katherine C. Byrne (1957-2024). On May 31, 1959, while flying from Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point to Naval Air Station Glenview in a Skyraider, Lt. Byrne attempted to land in a dense fog. After being waved off for landing twice, his plane&#x27;s wing struck the porch of a nearby house and the plane crashed into Sunset Memorial Park, killing him. 

Byrne married journalist Jay McMullen in 1978, and they remained married until his death from lung cancer in 1992. Byrne lived in the same apartment building from the 1970s until her death in 2014. She has one grandchild, Willie. Her daughter, Kathy, who died in 2024, was a lawyer with a Chicago firm. Mayor Byrne&#x27;s book, &quot;My Chicago&quot; (1992) covers her life through her political career. In 2011, Byrne attended the inauguration of the city&#x27;s then new mayor, Rahm Emanuel.

==Death and legacy==

Byrne had entered hospice care and died on November 14, 2014, in Chicago, aged 81, from complications of a stroke she suffered in January 2013. She was survived by her daughter Katherine and her grandson Willie. Her funeral Mass was held at St. Vincent de Paul Church on Monday, November 17, 2014. She was buried at Calvary Catholic Cemetery in Evanston, Illinois.

In a dedication ceremony held on August 29, 2014, Governor Pat Quinn renamed the Circle Interchange in Chicago the &quot;Jane Byrne Interchange&quot;. In July 2014, the Chicago City Council voted to rename the plaza surrounding the historic Chicago Water Tower on North Michigan Avenue the Jane M. Byrne Plaza in her honor.

Byrne was also known for coining the malapropism &quot;fruitworthy&quot;.

<text>Harold Lee Washington (April 15, 1922 – November 25, 1987) was an American lawyer and politician who was the 51st mayor of Chicago. In April 1983, Washington became the first African American to be elected as the city’s mayor at the age of 60. He served as mayor from April 29, 1983, until his untimely death in 1987. Born in Chicago and raised in the Bronzeville neighborhood, Washington became involved in local 3rd Ward politics under Chicago Alderman and future Congressman Ralph Metcalfe after graduating from Roosevelt University and Northwestern University School of Law. Washington was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1981 to 1983, representing Illinois&#x27;s first district. Washington had previously served in the Illinois State Senate and the Illinois House of Representatives from 1965 until 1976.

==Biography==
===Ancestry===
The earliest known ancestor of Harold Lee Washington, Isam/Isham Washington, was born a slave in 1832 in North Carolina. In 1864, he enlisted in the 8th United States Colored Heavy Artillery, Company L, in Paducah, Kentucky. Following his discharge in 1866, he began farming with his wife, Rebecca Neal, in Ballard County, Kentucky. Among their six children was Isam/Isom McDaniel (Mack) Washington, who was born in 1875. In 1896, Mack Washington married Arbella Weeks of Massac County, who had been born in Mississippi in 1878. In 1897, their first son, Roy L. Washington, father of Mayor Washington, was born in Ballard County, Kentucky. In 1903, shortly after both families moved to Massac County, Illinois, the elder Washington died. After farming for a time, Mack Washington became a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.) Church, serving numerous churches in Illinois until the death of his wife in 1952. Reverend I.M.D. Washington died in 1953.

===Early life and education===
Harold Lee Washington was born on April 15, 1922, at Cook County Hospital which is in Chicago, Illinois, to Roy and Bertha Washington. While still in high school in Lawrenceville, Illinois, Roy met Bertha from nearby Carrier Mills and the two married in 1916 in Harrisburg, Illinois. Their first son, Roy Jr., was born in Carrier Mills before the family moved to Chicago, where Roy enrolled in Kent College of Law. A lawyer, he became one of the first black precinct captains in the city and a Methodist minister. In 1918, daughter Geneva was born, and second son Edward was born in 1920. Bertha left the family, possibly to seek her fortune as a singer, and the couple divorced in 1928. Bertha remarried and had seven more children, including Ramon Price, who was an artist and eventually became chief curator of The DuSable Museum of African American History. Harold Washington grew up in Bronzeville, a Chicago neighborhood that was the center of black culture for the entire Midwest in the early and middle 20th century. Edward and Harold stayed with their father, while Roy Jr. and Geneva were cared for by their grandparents. After attending St. Benedict the Moor Boarding School in Milwaukee from 1928 to 1932, Washington attended DuSable High School, a newly established racially segregated public school, and was part of its inaugural four-year graduating class in June 1939. In a citywide track meet in 1938, Washington claimed first place in the 110-meter high hurdles and second place in the 220-meter low hurdles, playing a key role in the school&#x27;s victory in the Chicago Public League Championship that year. After high school, Washington worked at a meatpacking plant for a time before his father helped him get a job at the U.S. Treasury branch in the city. There he met Nancy Dorothy Finch, whom he married soon after; Washington was 19 years old and Dorothy was 17 years old. Seven months later, the U.S. was drawn into World War II with the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese on Sunday, December 7, 1941.

===Military service===
In 1942, Washington was drafted into the United States Army for the war effort and, after basic training, sent overseas as part of a racially segregated unit of the U.S. Army Air Corps unit of Engineers. After the American invasion of the Philippines in 1944, on Leyte Island and later the main Luzon island, Washington was part of a unit building runways for bombers, protective fighter aircraft, refueling planes, and returning damaged aircraft. Eventually, Washington rose to the rank of First Sergeant in the Army Air Forces.

===Roosevelt College===
In the summer of 1946, Washington, aged 24 and a war veteran, enrolled at Roosevelt College (now Roosevelt University). Washington joined other groups of students not permitted to enroll in other local colleges. Local estimates place the student population of Roosevelt College at about 1/8 black and 1/2  Jewish. A full 75% of the students had enrolled because of the &quot;nondiscriminatory progressive principles&quot;. He chaired a fund-raising drive by students, and then was named to a committee that supported citywide efforts to outlaw &quot;restrictive covenants&quot; in housing, the legal means by which ethnic minorities (especially blacks and, to a lesser extent, Jews) were prohibited from purchasing real estate in predominantly white neighborhoods of the city.

In 1946, after the college had moved to the Auditorium Building, Washington was elected the third president of Roosevelt&#x27;s student council. Under his leadership, the student council successfully petitioned the college to have student representation on Roosevelt&#x27;s faculty committees. At the first regional meeting of the newly founded National Student Association in the spring of 1948, Washington and nine other delegates proposed student representation on college faculties, and a &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; for students; both measures were roundly defeated. The next year, Washington went to the state capital at Springfield to protest Illinois legislators&#x27; coming probe of &quot;subversives&quot;.. The probe of investigation would outlaw the Communist Party and require &quot;loyalty oaths&quot; for teachers. He led students&#x27; opposition to the bills, although they would pass later in 1949.

During his Roosevelt College years, Washington came to be known for his stability. His friends said that he had a &quot;remarkable ability to keep cool&quot;, reason carefully and walk a middle line. Washington intentionally avoided extremist activities, including street actions and sit-ins against racially segregated restaurants and businesses. Overall, Washington and other radical activists ended up sharing a mutual respect for each other, acknowledging both Washington&#x27;s pragmatism and the activists&#x27; idealism. With the opportunities found only at Roosevelt College in the late 1940s, Washington&#x27;s time at the Roosevelt College proved to be pivotal. Washington graduated in August 1949, with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree. In addition to his activities at Roosevelt, he was a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.

===Northwestern University School of Law===
Washington then applied for and was admitted to study law at the Northwestern University School of Law in Chicago. During this time, Washington was divorced from Dorothy Finch. By some accounts, Harold and Dorothy had simply grown apart after Washington was sent overseas during the war during the first year of his marriage. Others saw both as young and headstrong, the relationship doomed from the beginning. Another friend of Washington&#x27;s deemed Harold &quot;not the marrying kind&quot;. He would not marry again, but continued to have relationships with other women; his longtime secretary is said to have said, &quot;If every woman Harold slept with stood at one end of City Hall, the building would sink five inches into LaSalle Street!&quot;.

At Northwestern Law School, Washington was the only black student in his class (there were six women in the class, one of them being Dawn Clark Netsch). As at Roosevelt, he entered school politics. In 1951, his last year, he was elected treasurer of the Junior Bar Association (JBA). The election was largely symbolic, however, and Washington&#x27;s attempts to give the JBA more authority at Northwestern were largely unsuccessful. On campus, Washington joined the Nu Beta Epsilon fraternity, largely because he and the other people who were members of ethnic minority groups which constituted the fraternity were blatantly excluded from the other fraternities on campus. Overall, Washington stayed away from the activism that defined his years at Roosevelt. During the evenings and weekends, he worked to supplement his GI Bill income. He received his JD in 1952.

== Early political career ==
From 1951 until he was first slated for election in 1965, Washington worked in the offices of the 3rd Ward Alderman, former Olympic athlete Ralph Metcalfe. Richard J. Daley was elected party chairman in 1952. Daley replaced C.C. Wimbush, an ally of William Dawson, on the party committee with Metcalfe. Under Metcalfe, the 3rd Ward was a critical factor in Mayor Daley&#x27;s 1955 mayoral election victory and ranked first in the city in the size of its Democratic plurality in 1961. While working under Metcalfe, Washington began to organize the 3rd Ward&#x27;s Young Democrats (YD) organization. At YD conventions, the 3rd Ward would push for numerous resolutions in the interest of blacks. Eventually, other black YD organizations would come to the 3rd Ward headquarters for advice on how to run their own organizations. Like he had at Roosevelt College, Washington avoided radicalism and preferred to work through the party to engender change.

While working with the Young Democrats, Washington met Mary Ella Smith. They dated for the next 20 years, and in 1983 Washington proposed to Smith. In an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Smith said that she never pressed Washington for marriage because she knew Washington&#x27;s first love was politics, saying, &quot;He was a political animal. He thrived on it, and I knew any thoughts of marriage would have to wait. I wasn&#x27;t concerned about that. I just knew the day would come.&quot;

In 1959 Al Janney, Gus Savage, Lemuel Bentley, Bennett Johnson, Luster Jackson and others founded the Chicago League of Negro Voters, one of the first African-American political organizations in the city. In its first election, Bentley drew 60,000 votes for city clerk. The endorsement of the League was deciding factor in the re-election of Leon Despres who was an independent voice in the City Council. Washington was a close friend of the founders of the League and worked with them from time to time. The League was key in electing Anna Langford, William Cousins and A. A. &quot;Sammy&quot; Rayner who were not part of the Daley machine. In 1963 the group moved to racially integrate and formed Protest at the Polls at a citywide conference which Washington independent candidates had gained traction within the black community, winning several aldermanic seats. In 1983, Protest at the Polls was instrumental in Washington&#x27;s run for mayor. By then, the YDs were losing to
independent candidates.

== Legislative career ==

=== Illinois House (1965–1976) ===
After the state legislature failed to reapportion districts every ten years as required by the census, the 1964 Illinois House of Representatives election was held at-large to elect all 177 members of the Illinois House of Representatives. With the Republicans and Democrats each only running 118 candidates, independent voting groups attempted to slate candidates. The League of Negro Voters created a &quot;Third Slate&quot; of 59 candidates, announcing the creation of the slate on June 27, 1964. Shortly afterwards, Daley created a slate which included Adlai Stevenson III and Washington. The Third Slate was then thrown out by the Illinois Election Board because of &quot;insufficient signatures&quot; on the nominating petitions. In the election, Washington was elected as part of the winning Democratic slate of candidates. Washington&#x27;s years in the Illinois House were marked by tension with Democratic Party leadership. In 1967, he was ranked by the Independent Voters of Illinois (IVI) as the fourth-most independent legislator in the Illinois House and named Best Legislator of the Year. His defiance of the &quot;idiot card&quot;, a sheet of paper that directed legislators&#x27; votes on every issue, attracted the attention of party leaders, who moved to remove Washington from his legislative position. Daley often told Metcalfe to dump Washington as a candidate, but Metcalfe did not want to risk losing the 3rd Ward&#x27;s Young Democrats, who were mostly aligned with Washington.

Washington backed Renault Robinson, a black police officer and one of the founders of the Afro-American Patrolmen&#x27;s League (AAPL). The aim of the AAPL was to fight against the racism which was directed against minority officers by the rest of the predominantly white department. Soon after the creation of the group, Robinson was written up for minor infractions, suspended, reinstated, and then placed on the graveyard shift on a single block behind central police headquarters. Robinson approached Washington and asked him to fashion a bill which would authorize the creation of a civilian review board, consisting of both patrolmen and officers, to monitor police brutality. Both black independent and white liberal legislators refused to back the bill, afraid to challenge Daley&#x27;s grip on the police force.

After Washington announced that he would support the AAPL, Metcalfe refused to protect him from Daley. Washington believed that he had the support of Ralph Tyler Smith, Speaker of the House. Instead, Smith criticized Washington and then allayed Daley&#x27;s anger. In exchange for the party&#x27;s backing, Washington would serve on the Chicago Crime Commission, the group Daley tasked with investigating the AAPL&#x27;s charges. The commission promptly found the AAPL&#x27;s charges &quot;unwarranted&quot;. An angry and humiliated Washington admitted that on the commission, he felt like Daley&#x27;s &quot;showcase ni***r&quot;. In 1969, Daley removed Washington&#x27;s name from the slate; only by the intervention of Cecil Partee, a party loyalist, was Washington reinstated. The Democratic Party supported Jim Taylor, a former professional boxer, Streets and Sanitation worker, over Washington. With Partee and his own ward&#x27;s support, Washington defeated Taylor. His years in the House of Representatives were focused on becoming an advocate for black rights. He continued work on the Fair Housing Act, and worked to strengthen the state&#x27;s Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC). In addition, he worked on a state Civil Rights Act, which would strengthen employment and housing provisions in the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964. In his first session, all of his bills were sent to committee or tabled. Like his time in Roosevelt College, Washington relied on parliamentary tactics (e.g., writing amendments guaranteed to fail in a vote) to enable him to bargain for more concessions.

Washington was accused of failing to file a tax return, even though the tax was paid. He was found guilty and sentenced to 36 days in jail. (1971)

Washington also passed bills in honor of civil rights figures. He passed a resolution in honor of Metcalfe, his mentor. He also passed a resolution in honor of James J. Reeb, a Unitarian minister who was beaten to death by a segregationist mob in Selma, Alabama. After the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., he introduced a series of bills which were aimed at making King&#x27;s birthday a state holiday. The first was tabled and later vetoed. The third bill he introduced, which was passed and signed by Gov. Richard Ogilvie, made Dr. King&#x27;s birthday a commemorative day observed by Illinois public schools. It was not until 1973 that Washington was able, with Partee&#x27;s help in the Senate, to have the bill enacted and signed by the governor.

====1975 speakership campaign====
Washington ran a largely symbolic campaign for Speaker. He only received votes from himself and from Lewis A. H. Caldwell. However, with a divided Democratic caucus, this was enough to help deny Daley-backed Clyde Choate the nomination, helping to throw it to William A. Redmond after 92 rounds of voting.

Redmond had Washington appointed as chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

==== Legal issues ====
In addition to Daley&#x27;s strong-arm tactics, Washington&#x27;s time in the Illinois House was also marred by problems with tax returns and allegations of not performing services owed to his clients. In her biography, Levinsohn questions whether the timing of Washington&#x27;s legal troubles was politically motivated. In November 1966, Washington was re-elected to the House over Daley&#x27;s strong objections; the first complaint was filed in 1964; the second was filed by January 1967. A letter asking Washington to explain the matter was sent on January 5, 1967. After failing to respond to numerous summons and subpoenas, the commission recommend a five-year suspension on March 18, 1968. A formal response to the charges did not occur until July 10, 1969. In his reply, Washington said that &quot;sometimes personal problems are enlarged out of proportion to the entire life picture at the time and the more important things are abandoned.&quot; In 1970, the Board of Managers of the Chicago Bar Association ruled that Washington&#x27;s license be suspended for only one year, not the five recommended; the total amount in question between all six clients was $205.

In 1971, Washington was charged with failure to file tax returns for four years, although the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) claimed to have evidence for nineteen years. Judge Sam Perry noted that he was &quot;disturbed that this case ever made it to my courtroom&quot;—while Washington had paid his taxes, he ended up owing the government a total of $508 as a result of not filing his returns. Typically, the IRS handled such cases in civil court, or within its bureaucracy. Washington pleaded &quot;no contest&quot; and was sentenced to forty days in Cook County Jail, a $1,000 fine, and three years of probation.

===Illinois Senate (1976–1980)===
====Campaign for a seat on the Illinois Senate====
In 1975, Partee, now President of the Senate and eligible for his pension, decided to retire from the Senate. Although Daley and Taylor declined at first, at Partee&#x27;s insistence, Washington was ultimately slated for the seat and he received the party&#x27;s support. Daley had been displeased with Washington for having run a symbolic challenge in 1975 to Daley-backed Clyde Choate for Illinois Speaker of the House (Washington had only received two votes). Additionally, he had ultimately helped push the vote towards Redmond as a compromise candidate. The United Automobile Workers union, whose backing Washington obtained, were critical in persuading Daley to relent to back his candidacy.

Washington defeated Anna Langford by nearly 2,000 votes in the Democratic primary. He went on to win the general election.

====Human Rights Act of 1980====
In the Illinois Senate, Washington&#x27;s main focus worked to pass 1980&#x27;s Illinois Human Rights Act. Legislators rewrote all of the human rights laws in the state, restricting discrimination based on &quot;race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, physical or mental disability, military status, sexual orientation, or unfavorable discharge from military service in connection with employment, real estate transactions, access to financial credit, and the availability of public accommodations.&quot; The bill&#x27;s origins began in 1970 with the rewriting of the Illinois Constitution. The new constitution required all governmental agencies and departments to be reorganized for efficiency. Republican governor James R. Thompson reorganized low-profile departments before his re-election in 1978. In 1979, during the early stages of his second term and immediately in the aftermath of the largest vote for a gubernatorial candidate in the state&#x27;s history, Thompson called for human rights reorganization. The bill would consolidate and remove some agencies, eliminating a number of political jobs. Some Democratic legislators would oppose any measure backed by Washington, Thompson and Republican legislators.

For many years, human rights had been a campaign issue brought up and backed by Democrats. Thompson&#x27;s staffers brought the bill to Washington and other black legislators before it was presented to the legislature. Washington made adjustments in anticipation of some legislators&#x27; concerns regarding the bill, before speaking for it in April 1979. On May 24, 1979, the bill passed the Senate by a vote of 59 to 1, with two voting present and six absent. The victory in the Senate was attributed by a Thompson staffer to Washington&#x27;s &quot;calm noncombative presentation&quot;. However, the bill stalled in the House. State Representative Susan Catania insisted on attaching an amendment to allow women guarantees in the use of credit cards. This effort was assisted by Carol Moseley Braun, a representative from Hyde Park who would later go on to serve as a U.S. Senator. State Representatives Jim Taylor and Larry Bullock introduced over one hundred amendments, including the text of the first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution, to try to stall the bill. With Catania&#x27;s amendment, the bill passed the House, but the Senate refused to accept the amendment. On June 30, 1979, the legislature adjourned.

===U.S. House (1981–1983)===
In 1980, Washington was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in Illinois&#x27;s 1st congressional district. He defeated incumbent Representative Bennett Stewart in the Democratic primary. Anticipating that the Democratic Party would challenge him in his bid for re-nomination in 1982, Washington spent much of his first term campaigning for re-election, often travelling back to Chicago to campaign. Washington missed many House votes, an issue that would come up in his campaign for mayor in 1983. Washington&#x27;s major congressional accomplishment involved legislation to extend the Voting Rights Act, legislation that opponents had argued was only necessary in an emergency. Others, including Congressman Henry Hyde, had submitted amendments designed to seriously weaken the power of the Voting Rights Act.

Although he had been called &quot;crazy&quot; for railing in the House of Representatives against deep cuts to social programs, Associated Press political reporter Mike Robinson noted that Washington worked &quot;quietly and thoughtfully&quot; as the time came to pass the act. During hearings in the South regarding the Voting Rights Act, Washington asked questions that shed light on tactics used to prevent African Americans from voting (among them, closing registration early, literacy tests, and gerrymandering). After the amendments were submitted on the floor, Washington spoke from prepared speeches that avoided rhetoric and addressed the issues. As a result, the amendments were defeated, and Congress passed the Voting Rights Act Extension. By the time Washington faced re-election in 1982, he had cemented his popularity in the 1st Congressional District. Jane Byrne could not find one serious candidate to run against Washington for his re-election campaign. He had collected 250,000 signatures to get on the ballot, although only 610 signatures (0.5% of the voters in the previous election) were required. With his re-election to Congress locked up, Washington turned his attention to the next Chicago mayoral election.

==Mayor of Chicago (1983–1987)==

===1983 Chicago mayoral election===

In the February 22, 1983, Democratic mayoral primary, more than 100,000 new voters registered to vote led by a coalition that included the Latino reformed gang Young Lords led by Jose Cha Cha Jimenez. On the North and Northwest Sides, the incumbent mayor Jane Byrne led and future mayor Richard M. Daley, son of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, finished a close second. Harold Washington had massive majorities on the South and West Sides. Southwest Side voters overwhelmingly supported Daley. Washington won with 37% of the vote, versus 33% for Byrne and 30% for Daley. Although winning the Democratic primary was normally considered tantamount to election in heavily Democratic Chicago, after his primary victory Washington found that his Republican opponent, former state legislator Bernard Epton (earlier considered a nominal stand-in), was supported by many high-ranking Democrats and their ward organizations, including the chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party, Alderman Edward Vrdolyak.

Epton&#x27;s campaign referred to, among other things, Washington&#x27;s conviction for failure to file income tax returns (he had paid the taxes, but had not filed a return). Washington, on the other hand, stressed reforming the Chicago patronage system and the need for a jobs program in a tight economy. In the April 12, 1983, mayoral general election, Washington defeated Epton by 3.7%, 51.7% to 48.0%, to become mayor of Chicago. Washington was sworn in as mayor on April 29, 1983, and resigned his Congressional seat the following day.

=== First term and Council Wars ===
During his tenure as mayor, Washington lived at the Hampton House apartments in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago. He created the city&#x27;s first environmental-affairs department under the management of longtime Great Lakes environmentalist Lee Botts. Washington&#x27;s first term in office was characterized by conflict with the city council dubbed &quot;Council Wars&quot;, referring to the then-recent &quot;Star Wars&quot; films and caused Chicago to be nicknamed &quot;Beirut on the Lake&quot;. A 29-alderman City Council majority refused to enact Washington&#x27;s legislation and prevented him from appointing nominees to boards and commissions. First-term challenges included city population loss and a massive decrease in ridership on the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA). Assertions that the overall crime rate increased were incorrect.

The 29, also known as the &quot;Vrdolyak 29&quot;, were led by Vrdolyak (who was an Alderman in addition to Cook County Democratic Party chairman) and Finance Chair, Alderman Edward Burke. Parks superintendent Edmund Kelly also opposed the mayor. The three were known as &quot;the Eddies&quot; and were supported by the younger Daley (now State&#x27;s Attorney), U.S. Congressmen Dan Rostenkowski and William Lipinski, and much of the Democratic Party. During his first city council meeting, Washington and the 21 supportive aldermen walked out of the meeting after a quorum had been established. Vrdolyak and the other 28 then chose committee chairmen and assigned aldermen to the various committees. Later lawsuits submitted by Washington and others were dismissed by Supreme Court Justice James C. Murray because it was determined that the appointments were legally made. Washington ruled by veto. The 29 lacked the 30th vote they needed to override Washington&#x27;s veto; female and African American aldermen supported Washington despite pressure from the Eddies. Meanwhile, in the courts, Washington kept the pressure on to reverse the redistricting of city council wards that the city council had created during the Byrne years. During special elections in 1986, victorious Washington-backed candidates in the first round ensured at least 24 supporters in the city council. Six weeks later, when Marlene Carter and Luís Gutiérrez won run-off elections, Washington had the 25 aldermen he needed. His vote as president of the City Council enabled him to break 25–25 tie-votes and enact his programs.

===1987 election===

Washington defeated former mayor Jane Byrne in the February 24, 1987, Democratic mayoral primary by 7.2%, 53.5% to 46.3%, and in the April 7, 1987, mayoral general election defeated Vrdolyak (Illinois Solidarity Party) by 11.8%, 53.8% to 42.8%, with Northwestern University business professor Donald Haider (Republican) getting 4.3%, to win reelection to a second term as mayor. Cook County Assessor Thomas Hynes (Chicago First Party), a Daley ally, dropped out of the race 36 hours before the mayoral general election. During Washington&#x27;s short second term, the Eddies lost much of their power: Vrdolyak became a Republican, Kelly was removed from his powerful parks post, and Burke lost his Finance Committee chairmanship.

===Political Education Project (PEP)===
From March 1984 to 1987, the Political Education Project (PEP) served as Washington&#x27;s political arm, organizing both Washington&#x27;s campaigns and the campaigns of his political allies. Harold Washington established the Political Education Project in 1984. This organization supported Washington&#x27;s interests in electoral politics beyond the Office of the Mayor. PEP helped organize political candidates for statewide elections in 1984 and managed Washington&#x27;s participation in the 1984 Democratic National Convention as a &quot;favorite son&quot; presidential candidate. PEP used its political connections to support candidates such as Luis Gutiérrez and Jesús &quot;Chuy&quot; García through field operations, voter registration and Election Day poll monitoring. Once elected, these aldermen helped break the stalemate between Washington and his opponents in the city council. Due to PEP&#x27;s efforts, Washington&#x27;s City Council legislation gained ground and his popularity grew as the 1987 mayoral election approached. In preparation for the 1987 mayoral election, PEP formed the Committee to Re-Elect Mayor Washington. This organization carried out fundraising for the campaign, conducted campaign events, and coordinated volunteers. PEP staff members, such as Joseph Gardner and Helen Shiller, went on to play leading roles in Chicago politics.

The organization disbanded upon Harold Washington&#x27;s death. Harold Washington&#x27;s Political Education Project Records is an archival collection detailing the organization&#x27;s work. It is located in the Chicago Public Library Special Collections, Harold Washington Library Center, Chicago, Illinois.

=== DuSable Park ===

Washington, during his mayorship, announced a plan to redevelop a commercial site into a DuSable Park, named in honor of Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, the honorary founder of the city. The project has yet to be completed, has experienced a number of bureaucratic reconceptions and roadblocks, and is currently spearheaded by the DuSable Heritage Association.

===Approval ratings===
Despite tumult between Washington and the City Council, Washington enjoyed positive approval among the city&#x27;s residents.

An April 1987 &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; poll of voters indicated that there was a significant age and gender gap in Washington&#x27;s approval, with Washington being more popularly approved of by voters under the age of 55 and by male voters.

===Historical assessments===
A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Washington as the nineteenth-best American big-city mayor to have served between the years 1820 and 1993.

==Death and funeral==
On November 25, 1987, at 11:00 am, Chicago Fire Department paramedics were called to City Hall. Washington&#x27;s press secretary, Alton Miller, had been discussing school board issues with the mayor when Washington suddenly slumped over on his desk, falling unconscious. After failing to revive Washington in his office, paramedics rushed him to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Further attempts to revive him failed, and Washington was pronounced dead at 1:36 p.m.

At Daley Plaza, Patrick Keen, project director for the Westside Habitat for Humanity, announced Washington&#x27;s official time of death to a separate gathering of Chicagoans. Initial reactions to the pronouncement of his death were of shock and sadness, as many black people believed that Washington was the only top Chicago official who would address their concerns. Following his death, President Ronald Reagan issued a statement calling Washington a &quot;dedicated and outspoken leader who guided one of our nation&#x27;s largest cities through the 1980&#x27;s&quot;.

Thousands of Chicagoans attended his wake in the lobby of City Hall between November 27 and 29, 1987. On November 30, 1987, Reverend B. Herbert Martin officiated Washington&#x27;s funeral service in Christ Universal Temple at 119th Street and Ashland Avenue in Chicago. After the service, Washington was buried in Oak Woods Cemetery on the South Side of Chicago.

===Rumors===
Immediately after Washington&#x27;s death, rumors about how Washington died began to surface. On January 6, 1988, Dr. Antonio Senat, Washington&#x27;s personal physician, denied &quot;unfounded speculations&quot; that Washington had cocaine in his system at the time of his death, or that foul play was involved. Cook County Medical Examiner Robert J. Stein performed an autopsy on Washington and concluded that Washington had died of a heart attack. Washington had weighed , and suffered from hypertension, high cholesterol levels, and an enlarged heart. On June 20, 1988, Alton Miller again indicated that drug reports on Washington had come back negative, and that Washington had not been poisoned prior to his death. Dr. Stein stated that the only drug in Washington&#x27;s system had been lidocaine, which is used to stabilize the heart after a heart attack takes place. The drug was given to Washington either by paramedics or by doctors at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Bernard Epton, Washington&#x27;s opponent in the 1983 general election, died 18 days later, on December 13, 1987.

==Legacy==

At a party held shortly after his re-election on April 7, 1987, Washington said to a group of supporters, &quot;In the old days, when you told people in other countries that you were from Chicago, they would say, &#x27;Boom-boom! Rat-a-tat-tat!&#x27; Nowadays, they say [crowd joins with him], &#x27;How&#x27;s Harold?&#x27;!&quot;

In later years, various city facilities and institutions were named or renamed after the late mayor to commemorate his legacy. The new building housing the main branch of the Chicago Public Library, located at 400 South State Street, was named the Harold Washington Library Center. The Chicago Public Library Special Collections, located on the building&#x27;s 9th floor, house the Harold Washington Archives and Collections. These archives hold numerous collections related to Washington&#x27;s life and political career. The building also contains Jacob Lawrence&#x27;s mural &quot;Events in the Life of Harold Washington&quot;.

Five months after Washington&#x27;s sudden death in office, a ceremony was held on April 19, 1988, changing the name of Loop College, one of the City Colleges of Chicago, to Harold Washington College. Harold Washington Elementary School in Chicago&#x27;s Chatham neighborhood is also named after the former mayor. In August 2004, the Harold Washington Cultural Center opened to the public in the Bronzeville neighborhood. Across from the Hampton House apartments where Washington lived, a city park was renamed Harold Washington Park, which was known for &quot;Harold&#x27;s Parakeets&quot;, a colony of feral monk parakeets that inhabited Ash Trees in the park. A building on the campus of Chicago State University is named Harold Washington Hall.

Six months after Washington&#x27;s death, School of the Art Institute of Chicago student David Nelson painted &quot;Mirth &amp; Girth&quot;, a full-length portrait depicting Washington wearing women&#x27;s lingerie. The work was unveiled on May 11, 1988, opening day of SAIC&#x27;s annual student exhibition. Within hours, City aldermen and members of the Chicago Police Department seized the painting. It was later returned, but with a five-inch (13 cm) gash in the canvas. Nelson, assisted by the ACLU, filed a federal lawsuit against the city, claiming that the painting&#x27;s confiscation and subsequent damaging violated his First Amendment rights. The complainants eventually split a US$95,000 (1994, US$138,000 in 2008) settlement from the city.

<text>In plasma physics, plasma stability concerns the stability properties of a plasma in equilibrium and its behavior under small perturbations. The stability of the system determines if the perturbations will grow, oscillate, or be damped out. It is an important consideration in topics such as nuclear fusion and astrophysical plasma.

In many cases, a plasma can be treated as a fluid and analyzed with the theory of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). MHD stability is necessary for stable operation of magnetic confinement fusion devices and places certain operational limits. The beta limit, for example, sets the maximum achievable plasma beta in tokamaks.

On the other hand, small-scale plasma instabilities (typically described by kinetic theory), such as the drift wave instability, are believed to be the driving mechanism of turbulent transport in tokamaks, which leads to high rate of particle and energy transport across the confining magnetic fields. Plasma instabilities described by kinetic theory can contain aspects such as finite Larmor radius (FLR) effects and resonant wave-particle interactions, which is not captured in fluid models such as MHD.

== Plasma instabilities ==
Plasma instabilities can be divided into two general groups:
#hydrodynamic instabilities
#kinetic instabilities.

Plasma instabilities are also categorized into different modes (e.g. with reference to a particle beam):

== MHD Instabilities ==

Beta is a ratio of the plasma pressure over the magnetic field strength.
formula_1

MHD stability at high beta is crucial for a compact, cost-effective magnetic fusion reactor. Fusion power density varies roughly as formula_2 at constant magnetic field, or as formula_3 at constant bootstrap fraction in configurations with externally driven plasma current. (Here formula_4 is the normalized beta.) In many cases MHD stability represents the primary limitation on beta and thus on fusion power density. MHD stability is also closely tied to issues of creation and sustainment of certain magnetic configurations, energy confinement, and steady-state operation. Critical issues include understanding and extending the stability limits through the use of a
variety of plasma configurations, and developing active means for reliable operation near those limits. Accurate predictive capabilities are needed, which will require the addition of new physics to existing MHD models. Although a wide range of magnetic configurations exist, the underlying MHD physics is common to all. Understanding of MHD stability gained in one configuration can benefit others, by verifying analytic theories, providing benchmarks for predictive MHD stability codes, and advancing the development of active control techniques.

The most fundamental and critical stability issue for magnetic fusion is simply that MHD instabilities often limit performance at high beta. In most cases the important instabilities are long wavelength, global modes, because of their ability to cause severe degradation of energy confinement or termination of the plasma. Some important examples that are common to many magnetic configurations are ideal kink modes, resistive wall modes, and neoclassical tearing modes. A possible consequence of violating stability boundaries is a disruption, a sudden loss of thermal energy often followed by termination of the discharge. The key issue thus includes understanding the nature of the beta limit in the various configurations, including the associated thermal and magnetic stresses, and finding ways to avoid the limits or mitigate the consequences. A wide range of approaches to preventing such instabilities is under investigation, including optimization of the configuration of the plasma and its confinement device, control of the internal structure of the plasma, and active control of the MHD instabilities.

=== Ideal Instabilities ===
Ideal MHD instabilities driven by current or pressure gradients represent the ultimate operational limit for most configurations. The long-wavelength kink mode and short-wavelength ballooning mode limits are generally well understood and can in principle be avoided.

Intermediate-wavelength modes (n ~ 5–10 modes encountered in tokamak edge plasmas, for example) are less well understood due to the computationally intensive nature of the stability calculations. The extensive beta limit database for tokamaks is consistent with ideal MHD stability limits, yielding agreement to within about 10% in beta for cases where the internal profiles of the plasma are accurately measured. This good agreement provides confidence in ideal stability calculations for other configurations and in the design of prototype fusion reactors.

=== Resistive Wall Modes ===
Resistive wall modes (RWM) develop in plasmas that require the presence of a perfectly conducting wall for stability. RWM stability is a key issue for many magnetic configurations. Moderate beta values are possible without a nearby wall in the tokamak, stellarator, and other configurations, but a nearby conducting wall can significantly improve ideal kink mode stability in most configurations, including the tokamak, ST, reversed field pinch (RFP), spheromak, and possibly the FRC. In the advanced tokamak and ST, wall stabilization is critical for operation with a large bootstrap fraction. The spheromak requires wall stabilization to avoid the low-m, n tilt and shift modes, and possibly bending modes. However, in the presence of a non-ideal wall, the slowly growing RWM is unstable. The resistive wall mode has been a long-standing issue for the RFP, and has more recently been observed in tokamak experiments. Progress in understanding the physics of the RWM and developing the means to stabilize it could be directly applicable to all magnetic configurations. A closely related issue is to understand plasma rotation, its sources and sinks, and its role in stabilizing the RWM.

=== Resistive instabilities ===
Resistive instabilities are an issue for all magnetic configurations, since the onset can occur at beta values well below the ideal limit. The stability of neoclassical tearing modes (NTM) is a key issue for magnetic configurations with a strong bootstrap current. The NTM is a metastable mode; in certain plasma configurations, a sufficiently large deformation of the bootstrap current produced by a “seed island” can contribute to the growth of the island. The NTM is already an important performance-limiting factor in many tokamak experiments, leading to degraded confinement or disruption. Although the basic mechanism is well established, the capability to predict the onset in present and future devices requires better understanding of the damping mechanisms which determine the threshold island size, and of the mode coupling by which other instabilities (such as sawteeth in tokamaks) can generate seed islands. Resistive Ballooning Mode, similar to ideal ballooning, but with finite resistivity taken into consideration, provides another example of a resistive instability.

== Opportunities for Improving MHD Stability ==
=== Configuration ===
The configuration of the plasma and its confinement device represent an
opportunity to improve MHD stability in a robust way. The benefits of discharge shaping and low aspect ratio for ideal MHD stability have been clearly demonstrated in tokamaks and STs, and will continue to be investigated in experiments such as DIII-D, Alcator C-Mod, NSTX, and MAST. New stellarator experiments such as NCSX (proposed) will test the prediction that addition of appropriately designed helical coils can stabilize ideal kink modes at high beta, and lower-beta tests
of ballooning stability are possible in HSX. The new ST experiments provide an opportunity to test predictions that a low aspect ratio yields improved stability to tearing modes, including neoclassical, through a large stabilizing “Glasser effect” term associated with a large Pfirsch-Schlüter current. Neoclassical tearing modes can be avoided by minimizing the bootstrap current in quasi-helical and quasi-omnigenous stellarator configurations. Neoclassical tearing modes are also stabilized with the appropriate relative signs of the bootstrap current and the magnetic shear; this prediction is supported by the absence of NTMs in central negative shear regions of tokamaks. Stellarator configurations such as the proposed NCSX, a quasi-axisymmetric stellarator design, can be created with negative magnetic shear and positive bootstrap current to achieve stability to the NTM. Kink mode stabilization by a resistive wall has been demonstrated in RFPs and tokamaks, and will be investigated in other configurations including STs (NSTX) and spheromaks (SSPX). A new proposal to stabilize resistive wall modes by a flowing liquid lithium wall needs further evaluation.

=== Internal Structure ===
Control of the internal structure of the plasma allows more active avoidance of MHD instabilities. Maintaining the proper current density profile, for example, can help to maintain stability to tearing modes. Open-loop optimization of the pressure and current density profiles with external heating and current drive sources is routinely used in many devices. Improved diagnostic measurements along with localized heating and current drive sources, now becoming available, will allow active feedback control of the internal profiles in the near future.
Such work is beginning or planned in most of the large tokamaks (JET, JT–60U, DIII–D, C–Mod, and ASDEX–U) using RF heating and current drive. Real-time analysis of profile data such as MSE current profile measurements and real-time identification of stability boundaries are essential components of profile control. Strong plasma rotation can stabilize resistive wall modes, as demonstrated in tokamak experiments, and rotational shear is also predicted to stabilize resistive modes. Opportunities to test these predictions are provided by configurations such as the ST, spheromak, and FRC, which have a large natural diamagnetic rotation, as well as tokamaks with rotation driven by neutral beam injection. The Electric Tokamak experiment is intended to have a very large driven rotation, approaching Alfvénic regimes where ideal stability may also be influenced. Maintaining sufficient plasma rotation, and the possible role of the RWM in damping the rotation, are important issues that can be investigated in these experiments.

=== Feedback Control ===

Active feedback control of MHD instabilities should allow operation beyond the “passive” stability limits. Localized RF current drive at the rational surface is predicted to reduce or eliminate neoclassical tearing mode islands. Experiments have begun in ASDEX–U and COMPASS-D with promising results, and are planned for next year in DIII–D. Routine use of such a technique in generalized plasma conditions will require real-time identification of the unstable mode and its radial location. If the plasma rotation needed to stabilize the resistive wall mode cannot be maintained, feedback stabilization with external coils will be required. Feedback experiments have begun in DIII–D and HBT-EP, and feedback control should be explored for the RFP and other configurations. Physics understanding of these active control techniques will be directly applicable between configurations.

=== Disruption Mitigation ===
The techniques discussed above for improving MHD stability are the principal means of avoiding disruptions. However, in the event that these techniques do not prevent an instability, the effects of a disruption can be mitigated by various techniques. Experiments in JT–60U have demonstrated reduction of electromagnetic stresses through operation at a neutral point for vertical stability. Pre-emptive removal of the plasma energy by injection of a large gas puff or an impurity pellet has been demonstrated in tokamak experiments, and ongoing experiments in C–Mod, JT–60U, ASDEX–U, and DIII–D will improve the understanding and predictive capability. Cryogenic liquid jets of helium are another proposed technique, which may be required for larger devices. Mitigation techniques developed for tokamaks will be directly applicable to other configurations.

<text>In physics and engineering, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD; also called magneto-fluid dynamics or hydro­magnetics) is a model of electrically conducting fluids that treats all interpenetrating particle species together as a single continuous medium. It is primarily concerned with the low-frequency, large-scale, magnetic behavior in plasmas and liquid metals and has applications in multiple fields including space physics, geophysics, astrophysics, and engineering.

The word &quot;magneto­hydro­dynamics&quot; is derived from &#x27; meaning [[magnetic field]],&#x27; meaning water, and &quot;&quot; meaning movement. The field of MHD was initiated by Hannes Alfvén, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1970.

== History ==
The MHD description of electrically conducting fluids was first developed by Hannes Alfvén in a 1942 paper published in &quot;Nature&quot; titled &quot;Existence of Electromagnetic–Hydrodynamic Waves&quot; which outlined his discovery of what are now referred to as &quot;Alfvén waves&quot;. Alfvén initially referred to these waves as &quot;electromagnetic–hydrodynamic waves&quot;; however, in a later paper he noted, &quot;As the term &#x27;electromagnetic–hydrodynamic waves&#x27; is somewhat complicated, it may be convenient to call this phenomenon &#x27;magneto–hydrodynamic&#x27; waves.&quot;

== Equations ==
In MHD, motion in the fluid is described using linear combinations of the mean motions of the individual species: the current density formula_1 and the center of mass velocity formula_2. In a given fluid, each species formula_3 has a number density formula_4, mass formula_5, electric charge formula_6, and a mean velocity formula_7. The fluid&#x27;s total mass density is then formula_8, and the motion of the fluid can be described by the current density expressed as
:formula_9
and the center of mass velocity expressed as:
:formula_10

MHD can be described by a set of equations consisting of a continuity equation, an equation of motion, an equation of state, Ampère&#x27;s Law, Faraday&#x27;s law, and Ohm&#x27;s law. As with any fluid description to a kinetic system, a closure approximation must be applied to highest moment of the particle distribution equation. This is often accomplished with approximations to the heat flux through a condition of adiabaticity or isothermality.

In the adiabatic limit, that is, the assumption of an isotropic pressure formula_11 and isotropic temperature, a fluid with an adiabatic index formula_12, electrical resistivity formula_13, magnetic field formula_14, and electric field formula_15 can be described by the continuous equation
:formula_16
the equation of state
:formula_17
the equation of motion
:formula_18
the low-frequency Ampère&#x27;s law
:formula_19
Faraday&#x27;s law
:formula_20
and Ohm&#x27;s law
:formula_21
Taking the curl of this equation and using Ampère&#x27;s law and Faraday&#x27;s law results in the induction equation,
:formula_22
where formula_23 is the magnetic diffusivity.

In the equation of motion, the Lorentz force term formula_24 can be expanded using Ampère&#x27;s law and a vector calculus identity to give
:formula_25
where the first term on the right hand side is the magnetic tension force and the second term is the magnetic pressure force.

== Ideal MHD ==

The simplest form of MHD, ideal MHD, assumes that the resistive term formula_26 in Ohm&#x27;s law is small relative to the other terms such that it can be taken to be equal to zero. This occurs in the limit of large magnetic Reynolds numbers during which magnetic induction dominates over magnetic diffusion at the velocity and length scales under consideration. Consequently, processes in ideal MHD that convert magnetic energy into kinetic energy, referred to as &quot;ideal processes&quot;, cannot generate heat and raise entropy.

A fundamental concept underlying ideal MHD is the frozen-in flux theorem which states that the bulk fluid and embedded magnetic field are constrained to move together such that one can be said to be &quot;tied&quot; or &quot;frozen&quot; to the other. Therefore, any two points that move with the bulk fluid velocity and lie on the same magnetic field line will continue to lie on the same field line even as the points are advected by fluid flows in the system. The connection between the fluid and magnetic field fixes the topology of the magnetic field in the fluid—for example, if a set of magnetic field lines are tied into a knot, then they will remain so as long as the fluid has negligible resistivity. This difficulty in reconnecting magnetic field lines makes it possible to store energy by moving the fluid or the source of the magnetic field. The energy can then become available if the conditions for ideal MHD break down, allowing magnetic reconnection that releases the stored energy from the magnetic field.

=== Ideal MHD equations ===

In ideal MHD, the resistive term formula_26 vanishes in Ohm&#x27;s law giving the ideal Ohm&#x27;s law,
:formula_28
Similarly, the magnetic diffusion term formula_29 in the induction equation vanishes giving the ideal induction equation,
:formula_30

=== Applicability of ideal MHD to plasmas ===

Ideal MHD is only strictly applicable when:

# The plasma is strongly collisional, so that the time scale of collisions is shorter than the other characteristic times in the system, and the particle distributions are therefore close to Maxwellian.
# The resistivity due to these collisions is small. In particular, the typical magnetic diffusion times over any scale length present in the system must be longer than any time scale of interest.
# Interest in length scales much longer than the ion skin depth and Larmor radius perpendicular to the field, long enough along the field to ignore Landau damping, and time scales much longer than the ion gyration time (system is smooth and slowly evolving).

=== Importance of resistivity ===

In an imperfectly conducting fluid the magnetic field can generally move through the fluid following a diffusion law with the resistivity of the plasma serving as a diffusion constant. This means that solutions to the ideal MHD equations are only applicable for a limited time for a region of a given size before diffusion becomes too important to ignore. One can estimate the diffusion time across a solar active region (from collisional resistivity) to be hundreds to thousands of years, much longer than the actual lifetime of a sunspot—so it would seem reasonable to ignore the resistivity. By contrast, a meter-sized volume of seawater has a magnetic diffusion time measured in milliseconds.

Even in physical systems—which are large and conductive enough that simple estimates of the Lundquist number suggest that the resistivity can be ignored—resistivity may still be important: many instabilities exist that can increase the effective resistivity of the plasma by factors of more than 109. The enhanced resistivity is usually the result of the formation of small scale structure like current sheets or fine scale magnetic turbulence, introducing small spatial scales into the system over which ideal MHD is broken and magnetic diffusion can occur quickly. When this happens, magnetic reconnection may occur in the plasma to release stored magnetic energy as waves, bulk mechanical acceleration of material, particle acceleration, and heat.

Magnetic reconnection in highly conductive systems is important because it concentrates energy in time and space, so that gentle forces applied to a plasma for long periods of time can cause violent explosions and bursts of radiation.

When the fluid cannot be considered as completely conductive, but the other conditions for ideal MHD are satisfied, it is possible to use an extended model called resistive MHD. This includes an extra term in Ohm&#x27;s Law which models the collisional resistivity. Generally MHD computer simulations are at least somewhat resistive because their computational grid introduces a numerical resistivity.

== Structures in MHD systems ==

In many MHD systems most of the electric current is compressed into thin nearly-two-dimensional ribbons termed current sheets. These can divide the fluid into magnetic domains, inside of which the currents are relatively weak. Current sheets in
the solar corona are thought to be between a few meters and a few kilometers in thickness, which is quite thin compared to the magnetic domains (which are thousands to hundreds of thousands of kilometers across). Another example is in the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere, where current sheets separate topologically distinct domains, isolating most of the Earth&#x27;s ionosphere from the solar wind.

== Waves ==

The wave modes derived using the MHD equations are called magnetohydrodynamic waves or MHD waves. There are three MHD wave modes that can be derived from the linearized ideal-MHD equations for a fluid with a uniform and constant magnetic field:
* Alfvén waves
* Slow magnetosonic waves
* Fast magnetosonic waves

These modes have phase velocities that are independent of the magnitude of the wavevector, so they experience no dispersion. The phase velocity depends on the angle between the wave vector and the magnetic field . An MHD wave propagating at an arbitrary angle with respect to the time independent or bulk field will satisfy the dispersion relation
:formula_31
where
:formula_32
is the Alfvén speed. This branch corresponds to the shear Alfvén mode. Additionally the dispersion equation gives
:formula_33
where
:formula_34
is the ideal gas speed of sound. The plus branch corresponds to the fast-MHD wave mode and the minus branch corresponds to the slow-MHD wave mode. A summary of the properties of these waves is provided:
The MHD oscillations will be damped if the fluid is not perfectly conducting but has a finite conductivity, or if viscous effects are present.

MHD waves and oscillations are a popular tool for the remote diagnostics of laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, for example, the corona of the Sun (Coronal seismology).

== Extensions ==
; Resistive
: Resistive MHD describes magnetized fluids with finite electron diffusivity (). This diffusivity leads to a breaking in the magnetic topology; magnetic field lines can &#x27;reconnect&#x27; when they collide. Usually this term is small and reconnections can be handled by thinking of them as not dissimilar to shocks; this process has been shown to be important in the Earth-Solar magnetic interactions.
; Extended
: Extended MHD describes a class of phenomena in plasmas that are higher order than resistive MHD, but which can adequately be treated with a single fluid description. These include the effects of Hall physics, electron pressure gradients, finite Larmor Radii in the particle gyromotion, and electron inertia.
; Two-fluid
: Two-fluid MHD describes plasmas that include a non-negligible Hall electric field. As a result, the electron and ion momenta must be treated separately. This description is more closely tied to Maxwell&#x27;s equations as an evolution equation for the electric field exists.
; Hall
: In 1960, M. J. Lighthill criticized the applicability of ideal or resistive MHD theory for plasmas. It concerned the neglect of the &quot;Hall current term&quot; in Ohm&#x27;s law, a frequent simplification made in magnetic fusion theory. Hall-magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD) takes into account this electric field description of magnetohydrodynamics, and Ohm&#x27;s law takes the form
::formula_35
:where formula_36 is the electron number density and formula_37 is the elementary charge. The most important difference is that in the absence of field line breaking, the magnetic field is tied to the electrons and not to the bulk fluid.
; Electron MHD
: Electron Magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD) describes small scales plasmas when electron motion is much faster than the ion one. The main effects are changes in conservation laws, additional resistivity, importance of electron inertia. Many effects of Electron MHD are similar to effects of the Two fluid MHD and the Hall MHD. EMHD is especially important for z-pinch, magnetic reconnection, ion thrusters, neutron stars, and plasma switches. 
; Collisionless
: MHD is also often used for collisionless plasmas. In that case the MHD equations are derived from the Vlasov equation.
; Reduced
: By using a multiscale analysis the (resistive) MHD equations can be reduced to a set of four closed scalar equations. This allows for, amongst other things, more efficient numerical calculations.

== Limitations ==

=== Importance of kinetic effects ===

Another limitation of MHD (and fluid theories in general) is that they depend on the assumption that the plasma is strongly collisional (this is the first criterion listed above), so that the time scale of collisions is shorter than the other characteristic times in the system, and the particle distributions are Maxwellian. This is usually not the case in fusion, space and astrophysical plasmas. When this is not the case, or the interest is in smaller spatial scales, it may be necessary to use a kinetic model which properly accounts for the non-Maxwellian shape of the distribution function. However, because MHD is relatively simple and captures many of the important properties of plasma dynamics it is often qualitatively accurate and is therefore often the first model tried.

Effects which are essentially kinetic and not captured by fluid models include double layers, Landau damping, a wide range of instabilities, chemical separation in space plasmas and electron runaway. In the case of ultra-high intensity laser interactions, the incredibly short timescales of energy deposition mean that hydrodynamic codes fail to capture the essential physics.

== Applications ==

=== Geophysics ===
Beneath the Earth&#x27;s mantle lies the core, which is made up of two parts: the solid inner core and liquid outer core. Both have significant quantities of iron. The liquid outer core moves in the presence of the magnetic field and eddies are set up into the same due to the Coriolis effect. These eddies develop a magnetic field which boosts Earth&#x27;s original magnetic field—a process which is self-sustaining and is called the geomagnetic dynamo.

Based on the MHD equations, Glatzmaier and Paul Roberts have made a supercomputer model of the Earth&#x27;s interior. After running the simulations for thousands of years in virtual time, the changes in Earth&#x27;s magnetic field can be studied. The simulation results are in good agreement with the observations as the simulations have correctly predicted that the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field flips every few hundred thousand years. During the flips, the magnetic field does not vanish altogether—it just gets more complex.

====Earthquakes====
Some monitoring stations have reported that earthquakes are sometimes preceded by a spike in ultra low frequency (ULF) activity. A remarkable example of this occurred before the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in California, although a subsequent study indicates that this was little more than a sensor malfunction. On December 9, 2010, geoscientists announced that the DEMETER satellite observed a dramatic increase in ULF radio waves over Haiti in the month before the magnitude 7.0 Mw 2010 earthquake. Researchers are attempting to learn more about this correlation to find out whether this method can be used as part of an early warning system for earthquakes.

=== Space Physics ===
The study of space plasmas near Earth and throughout the Solar System is known as space physics. Areas researched within space physics encompass a large number of topics, ranging from the ionosphere to auroras, Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere, the Solar wind, and coronal mass ejections. 

MHD forms the framework for understanding how populations of plasma interact within the local geospace environment. Researchers have developed global models using MHD to simulate phenomena within Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere, such as the location of Earth&#x27;s magnetopause (the boundary between the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and the solar wind), the formation of the ring current, auroral electrojets, and geomagnetically induced currents. 

One prominent use of global MHD models is in space weather forecasting. Intense solar storms have the potential to cause extensive damage to satellites and infrastructure, thus it is crucial that such events are detected early. The Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) runs MHD models to predict the arrival and impacts of space weather events at Earth.

=== Astrophysics ===
MHD applies to astrophysics, including stars, the interplanetary medium (space between the planets), and possibly within the interstellar medium (space between the stars) and jets. Most astrophysical systems are not in local thermal equilibrium, and therefore require an additional kinematic treatment to describe all the phenomena within the system (see Astrophysical plasma).

Sunspots are caused by the Sun&#x27;s magnetic fields, as Joseph Larmor theorized in 1919. The solar wind is also governed by MHD. The differential solar rotation may be the long-term effect of magnetic drag at the poles of the Sun, an MHD phenomenon due to the Parker spiral shape assumed by the extended magnetic field of the Sun.

Previously, theories describing the formation of the Sun and planets could not explain how the Sun has 99.87% of the mass, yet only 0.54% of the angular momentum in the Solar System. In a closed system such as the cloud of gas and dust from which the Sun was formed, mass and angular momentum are both conserved. That conservation would imply that as the mass concentrated in the center of the cloud to form the Sun, it would spin faster, much like a skater pulling their arms in. The high speed of rotation predicted by early theories would have flung the proto-Sun apart before it could have formed. However, magnetohydrodynamic effects transfer the Sun&#x27;s angular momentum into the outer solar system, slowing its rotation.

Breakdown of ideal MHD (in the form of magnetic reconnection) is known to be the likely cause of solar flares. The magnetic field in a solar active region over a sunspot can store energy that is released suddenly as a burst of motion, X-rays, and radiation when the main current sheet collapses, reconnecting the field.

=== Magnetic confinement fusion ===
MHD describes a wide range of physical phenomena occurring in fusion plasmas in devices such as tokamaks or stellarators.

The Grad-Shafranov equation derived from ideal MHD describes the equilibrium of axisymmetric toroidal plasma in a tokamak. In tokamak experiments, the equilibrium during each discharge is routinely calculated and reconstructed, which provides information on the shape and position of the plasma controlled by currents in external coils.

MHD stability theory is known to govern the operational limits of tokamaks. For example, the ideal MHD kink modes provide hard limits on the achievable plasma beta (Troyon limit) and plasma current (set by the formula_38 requirement of the safety factor).

===Sensors===

Magnetohydrodynamic sensors are used for precision measurements of angular velocities in inertial navigation systems such as in aerospace engineering. Accuracy improves with the size of the sensor. The sensor is capable of surviving in harsh environments.

=== Engineering ===

MHD is related to engineering problems such as plasma confinement, liquid-metal cooling of nuclear reactors, and electromagnetic casting (among others).

A magnetohydrodynamic drive or MHD propulsor is a method for propelling seagoing vessels using only electric and magnetic fields with no moving parts, using magnetohydrodynamics. The working principle involves electrification of the propellant (gas or water) which can then be directed by a magnetic field, pushing the vehicle in the opposite direction. Although some working prototypes exist, MHD drives remain impractical.

The first prototype of this kind of propulsion was built and tested in 1965 by Steward Way, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Way, on leave from his job at Westinghouse Electric, assigned his senior-year undergraduate students to develop a submarine with this new propulsion system. In the early 1990s, a foundation in Japan (Ship &amp; Ocean Foundation (Minato-ku, Tokyo)) built an experimental boat, the &quot;Yamato-1&quot;, which used a magnetohydrodynamic drive incorporating a superconductor cooled by liquid helium, and could travel at 15 km/h.

MHD power generation fueled by potassium-seeded coal combustion gas showed potential for more efficient energy conversion (the absence of solid moving parts allows operation at higher temperatures), but failed due to cost-prohibitive technical difficulties. One major engineering problem was the failure of the wall of the primary-coal combustion chamber due to abrasion.

In microfluidics, MHD is studied as a fluid pump for producing a continuous, nonpulsating flow in a complex microchannel design.

MHD can be implemented in the continuous casting process of metals to suppress instabilities and control the flow.

Industrial MHD problems can be modeled using the open-source software EOF-Library. Two simulation examples are 3D MHD with a free surface for electromagnetic levitation melting, and liquid metal stirring by rotating permanent magnets.

===Magnetic drug targeting===
An important task in cancer research is developing more precise methods for delivery of medicine to affected areas. One method involves the binding of medicine to biologically compatible magnetic particles (such as ferrofluids), which are guided to the target via careful placement of permanent magnets on the external body. Magnetohydrodynamic equations and finite element analysis are used to study the interaction between the magnetic fluid particles in the bloodstream and the external magnetic field.

<text>The Great Chicago Fire was a conflagration that burned in the American city of Chicago during October 8–10, 1871. The fire killed approximately 300 people, destroyed roughly of the city including over 17,000 structures, and left more than 100,000 residents homeless. The fire began in a neighborhood southwest of the city center. A long period of hot, dry, windy conditions, and the wooden construction prevalent in the city, led to the conflagration spreading quickly. The fire leapt the south branch of the Chicago River and destroyed much of central Chicago and then crossed the main stem of the river, consuming the Near North Side.

Help flowed to the city from near and far after the fire. The city government improved building codes to stop the rapid spread of future fires and rebuilt rapidly to those higher standards. A donation from the United Kingdom spurred the establishment of the Chicago Public Library.

==Origin==

The fire is said to have started at about 8:30 p.m. on October 8, in or around a small barn belonging to the O&#x27;Leary family that bordered the alley behind 137 W. DeKoven Street. The shed next to the barn was the first building to be consumed by the fire. City officials never determined the cause of the blaze, but the rapid spread of the fire due to a long drought in that year&#x27;s summer, strong winds from the southwest, and the rapid destruction of the water pumping system explain the extensive damage of the mainly wooden city structures. There has been much speculation over the years on a single start to the fire. The most popular tale blames Mrs. O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s cow, which allegedly knocked over a lantern; others state that a group of men were gambling inside the barn and knocked over a lantern. Still other speculation suggests that the blaze was related to other fires in the Midwest that day.

The fire&#x27;s spread was aided by the city&#x27;s use of wood as the predominant building material in a style called balloon frame. More than two-thirds of the structures in Chicago at the time of the fire were made entirely of wood, with most of the houses and buildings being topped with highly combustible tar or shingle roofs. All of the city&#x27;s sidewalks and many roads were also made of wood. Compounding this problem, Chicago received only of rain from July 4 to October 9, causing severe drought conditions before the fire, while strong southwest winds helped to carry flying embers toward the heart of the city.

In 1871, the Chicago Fire Department had 185 firefighters with just 17 horse-drawn steam pumpers to protect the entire city. The initial response by the fire department was timely, but due to an error by the watchman, Matthias Schaffer, the firefighters were initially sent to the wrong place, allowing the fire to grow unchecked. An alarm sent from the area near the fire also failed to register at the courthouse where the fire watchmen were, while the firefighters were tired from having fought numerous small fires and one large fire in the week before. These factors combined to turn a small barn fire into a conflagration.

==Spread==

When firefighters finally arrived at DeKoven Street, the fire had grown and spread to neighboring buildings and was progressing toward the central business district. Firefighters had hoped that the South Branch of the Chicago River and an area that had previously thoroughly burned would act as a natural firebreak. All along the river, however, were lumber yards, warehouses, and coal yards, as well as barges, and numerous bridges across the river. As the fire grew, the southwest wind intensified and the temperature rose, causing structures to catch fire from the heat and from burning debris blown by the wind. Around midnight, flaming debris blew across the river and landed on roofs and the South Side Gas Works.

With the fire across the river and moving rapidly toward the heart of the city, panic set in. About this time, Mayor Roswell B. Mason sent messages to nearby towns asking for help. When the courthouse caught fire, he ordered the building to be evacuated and the prisoners jailed in the basement to be released. At 2:30 a.m. on the 9th, the cupola of the courthouse collapsed, sending the great bell crashing down. Some witnesses reported hearing the sound from a mile (1.6 km) away.

As more buildings succumbed to the flames, a major contributing factor to the fire&#x27;s spread was a meteorological phenomenon known as a fire whirl. As hot air rises, it comes into contact with cooler air and begins to spin, creating a tornado-like effect. These fire whirls are likely what drove flaming debris so high and so far. Such debris was blown across the main branch of the Chicago River to a railroad car carrying kerosene. The fire had jumped the river a second time and was now raging across the city&#x27;s north side.

Despite the fire spreading and growing rapidly, the city&#x27;s firefighters continued to battle the blaze. A short time after the fire jumped the river, a burning piece of timber lodged on the roof of the city&#x27;s waterworks. Within minutes, the interior of the building was engulfed in flames and the building was destroyed. With it, the city&#x27;s water mains went dry and the city was helpless. The fire burned unchecked from building to building, block to block.

Late in the evening of October 9, it started to rain, but the fire had already started to burn itself out. The fire had spread to the sparsely populated areas of the north side, having thoroughly consumed the densely populated areas.

==Aftermath==
Once the fire had ended, the smoldering remains were still too hot for a survey of the damage to be completed for many days. Eventually, the city determined that the fire destroyed an area about long and averaging wide, encompassing an area of more than . Destroyed were more than of roads, of sidewalk, 2,000 lampposts, 17,500 buildings, and $222 million in property, which was about a third of the city&#x27;s valuation in 1871.

On October 11, 1871, General Philip H. Sheridan came quickly to the aid of the city and was placed in charge by a proclamation, given by mayor Roswell B. Mason: &quot;The Preservation of the Good Order and Peace of the city is hereby intrusted to Lieut. General P.H. Sheridan, U.S. Army.&quot;To protect the city from looting and violence, the city was put under martial law for two weeks under Gen. Sheridan&#x27;s command structure with a mix of regular troops, militia units, police, and a specially organized civilian group &quot;First Regiment of Chicago Volunteers.&quot; Former Lieutenant-Governor William Bross, and part owner of the &quot;Tribune&quot;, later recollected his response to the arrival of Gen. Sheridan and his soldiers: &quot;Never did deeper emotions of joy overcome me. Thank God, those most dear to me and the city as well are safe.&quot;
For two weeks Sheridan&#x27;s men patrolled the streets, guarded the relief warehouses, and enforced other regulations. On October 24 the troops were relieved of their duties and the volunteers were mustered out of service.

Of the approximately 324,000 inhabitants of Chicago in 1871, 90,000 Chicago residents (about 28% of the population) were left homeless. 120 bodies were recovered, but the death toll may have been as high as 300. The county coroner speculated that an accurate count was impossible, as some victims may have drowned or had been incinerated, leaving no remains.

In the days and weeks following the fire, monetary donations flowed into Chicago from around the country and abroad, along with donations of food, clothing, and other goods. These donations came from individuals, corporations, and cities. New York City gave $450,000 along with clothing and provisions, St. Louis gave $300,000, and the Common Council of London gave 1,000 guineas, as well as £7,000 from private donations. In Greenock, Scotland (pop. 40,000) a town meeting raised £518 on the spot. Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Buffalo, all commercial rivals, donated hundreds and thousands of dollars. Milwaukee, along with other nearby cities, helped by sending fire-fighting equipment. Food, clothing and books were brought by train from all over the continent. Mayor Mason placed the Chicago Relief and Aid Society in charge of the city&#x27;s relief efforts.

Operating from the First Congregational Church, city officials and aldermen began taking steps to preserve order in Chicago. Price gouging was a key concern, and in one ordinance, the city set the price of bread at 8¢ for a loaf. Public buildings were opened as places of refuge, and saloons closed at 9 in the evening for the week following the fire. Many people who were left homeless after the incident were never able to get their normal lives back since all their personal papers and belongings burned in the conflagration.

After the fire, A. H. Burgess of London proposed an &quot;English Book Donation&quot;, to spur a free library in Chicago, in their sympathy with Chicago over the damages suffered. Libraries in Chicago had been private with membership fees. In April 1872, the City Council passed the ordinance to establish the free Chicago Public Library, starting with the donation from the United Kingdom of more than 8,000 volumes.

The fire also led to questions about development in the United States. Due to Chicago&#x27;s rapid expansion at that time, the fire led to Americans reflecting on industrialization. Based on a religious point of view, some said that Americans should return to a more old-fashioned way of life, and that the fire was caused by people ignoring traditional morality. On the other hand, others believed that a lesson to be learned from the fire was that cities needed to improve their building techniques. Frederick Law Olmsted observed that poor building practices in Chicago were a problem:

Chicago had a weakness for &quot;big things&quot;, and liked to think that it was outbuilding New York. It did a great deal of commercial advertising in its house-tops. The faults of construction as well as of art in its great showy buildings must have been numerous. Their walls were thin, and were overweighted with gross and coarse misornamentation.

Olmsted also believed that with brick walls, and disciplined firemen and police, the deaths and damage caused would have been much less.

Almost immediately, the city began to rewrite its fire standards, spurred by the efforts of leading insurance executives, and fire-prevention reformers such as Arthur C. Ducat. Chicago soon developed one of the country&#x27;s leading fire-fighting forces.

Business owners and land speculators such as Gurdon Saltonstall Hubbard quickly set about rebuilding the city. The first load of lumber for rebuilding was delivered the day the last burning building was extinguished. By the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition 22 years later, Chicago hosted more than 21 million visitors. The Palmer House hotel burned to the ground in the fire 13 days after its grand opening. Its developer, Potter Palmer, secured a loan and rebuilt the hotel to higher standards, across the street from the original, proclaiming it to be &quot;The World&#x27;s First Fireproof Building&quot;.

In 1956, the remaining structures on the original O&#x27;Leary property at 558 W. DeKoven Street were torn down for construction of the Chicago Fire Academy, a training facility for Chicago firefighters, known as the Quinn Fire Academy or Chicago Fire Department Training Facility. A bronze sculpture of stylized flames, entitled &quot;Pillar of Fire&quot; by Egon Weiner, was erected on the point of origin in 1961.

==Surviving structures==

The following structures from the burned district are still standing:

*St. Michael&#x27;s Church, Old Town
*Chicago Water Tower
*Chicago Avenue Pumping Station 
*Police Constable Bellinger&#x27;s cottage at 21 Lincoln Place (2121 North Hudson, today). 
*2323 and 2339 North Cleveland Avenue also survived the blaze.

St. Michael&#x27;s Church and the Pumping Station were both gutted in the fire, but their exteriors survived, and the buildings were rebuilt using the surviving walls. Additionally, though the inhabitable portions of the building were destroyed, the bell tower of St. James Cathedral survived the fire and was incorporated into the rebuilt church. The stones near the top of the tower are still blackened from the soot and smoke.

==Panorama of damage==
==Precise start==
Almost from the moment the fire broke out, various theories about its cause began to circulate. The most popular and enduring legend maintains that the fire began in the O&#x27;Leary barn as Mrs. O&#x27;Leary was milking her cow. The cow kicked over a lantern (or an oil lamp in some versions), setting fire to the barn. The O&#x27;Leary family denied this, stating that they were in bed before the fire started, but stories of the cow began to spread across the city. Catherine O&#x27;Leary seemed the perfect scapegoat: she was a poor, Irish Catholic immigrant. During the latter half of the 19th century, anti-Irish sentiment was strong in Chicago and throughout the United States. This was intensified as a result of the growing political power of the city&#x27;s Irish population.

Furthermore, the United States had been distrustful of Catholics (or papists, as they were often called) since its beginning, carrying over attitudes in England in the 17th century; as an Irish Catholic, Mrs. O&#x27;Leary was a target of both anti-Catholic and anti-Irish sentiment. This story was circulating in Chicago even before the flames had died out, and it was noted in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;&#x27;s first post-fire issue. In 1893 the reporter Michael Ahern retracted the &quot;cow-and-lantern&quot; story, admitting it was fabricated, but even his confession was unable to put the legend to rest. Although the O&#x27;Learys were never officially charged with starting the fire, the story became so engrained in local lore that Chicago&#x27;s city council officially exonerated them—and the cow—in 1997.

Amateur historian Richard Bales has suggested the fire started when Daniel &quot;Pegleg&quot; Sullivan, who first reported the fire, ignited hay in the barn while trying to steal milk. Part of Bales&#x27;s evidence includes an account by Sullivan, who claimed in an inquiry before the Fire Department of Chicago on November 25, 1871, that he saw the fire coming through the side of the barn and ran across DeKoven Street to free the animals from the barn, one of which included a cow owned by Sullivan&#x27;s mother. Bales&#x27;s account does not have consensus. The Chicago Public Library staff criticized his account in their web page on the fire. Despite this, the Chicago city council was convinced of Bales&#x27;s argument and stated that the actions of Sullivan on that day should be scrutinized after the O&#x27;Leary family was exonerated in 1997.

Anthony DeBartolo reported evidence in two articles of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; (October 8, 1997, and March 3, 1998, reprinted in &quot;Hyde Park Media&quot;) suggesting that Louis M. Cohn may have started the fire during a craps game. Following his death in 1942, Cohn bequeathed $35,000 which was assigned by his executors to the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University. The bequest was given to the school on September 28, 1944, and the dedication contained a claim by Cohn to have been present at the start of the fire. According to Cohn, on the night of the fire, he was gambling in the O&#x27;Learys&#x27; barn with one of their sons and some other neighborhood boys. When Mrs. O&#x27;Leary came out to the barn to chase the gamblers away at around 9:00, they knocked over a lantern in their flight, although Cohn states that he paused long enough to scoop up the money. The argument is not universally accepted.

An alternative theory, first suggested in 1882 by Ignatius L. Donnelly in &quot;&quot;, is that the fire was caused by a meteor shower. This was described as a &quot;fringe theory&quot; concerning Biela&#x27;s Comet. At a 2004 conference of the Aerospace Corporation and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, engineer and physicist Robert Wood suggested that the fire began when a fragment of Biela&#x27;s Comet impacted the Midwest. Biela&#x27;s Comet had broken apart in 1845 and had not been observed since. Wood argued that four large fires took place, all on the same day, all on the shores of Lake Michigan (see related events), suggesting a common root cause. Eyewitnesses reported sighting spontaneous ignitions, lack of smoke, &quot;balls of fire&quot; falling from the sky, and blue flames. According to Wood, these accounts suggest that the fires were caused by the methane that is commonly found in comets.

Meteorites are not known to start or spread fires and are cool to the touch after reaching the ground, so this theory has not found favor in the scientific community. Methane-air mixtures become flammable only when the methane concentration exceeds 5%, at which point the mixtures also become explosive, a situation unlikely to occur from meteorites. Methane gas is lighter than air and thus does not accumulate near the ground; any localized pockets of methane in the open air rapidly dissipate. Moreover, if a fragment of an icy comet were to strike the Earth, the most likely outcome, due to the low tensile strength of such bodies, would be for it to disintegrate in the upper atmosphere, leading to a meteor air burst like the Tunguska event.

The specific choice of Biela&#x27;s Comet does not match with the dates in question, as the 6-year period of the comet&#x27;s orbit did not intersect that of the Earth until 1872, one full year after the fire, when a large meteor shower was observed. A common cause for the fires in the Midwest in late 1871 is that the area had had a dry summer, so that winds from the front that moved in that evening were capable of generating rapidly expanding blazes from available ignition sources, which were plentiful in the region.

==Related events==

On that hot, dry, and windy autumn day, three other major fires occurred along the shores of Lake Michigan at the same time as the Great Chicago Fire. Some to the north, the Peshtigo Fire consumed the town of Peshtigo, Wisconsin, along with a dozen other villages. It killed 1,200 to 2,500 people and charred approximately . The Peshtigo Fire remains the deadliest in American history but the remoteness of the region meant it was little noticed at the time, because one of the first things that burned were the telegraph lines to Green Bay.

Across the lake to the east, the town of Holland, Michigan, and other nearby areas burned to the ground. Some to the north of Holland, the lumbering community of Manistee also went up in flames in what became known as the Great Michigan Fire.

Farther east, along the shore of Lake Huron, the Port Huron Fire swept through Port Huron, Michigan and much of Michigan&#x27;s &quot;Thumb&quot;. On October 9, 1871, a fire swept through the city of Urbana, Illinois, south of Chicago, destroying portions of its downtown area. Windsor, Ontario, likewise burned on October 12.

The city of Singapore, Michigan, provided a large portion of the lumber to rebuild Chicago. As a result, the area was so heavily deforested that the land deteriorated into barren sand dunes that buried the town, and the town had to be abandoned.

* The University of Illinois at Chicago athletic teams have been nicknamed Flames since 1982, in commemoration of the Great Chicago Fire.
* Although set in Philadelphia, Theodore Dreiser&#x27;s 1912 novel &quot;The Financier&quot; portrays the nationwide impact the 1871 Chicago fire had on the stock markets and the financial world.
* The 1938 film &quot;In Old Chicago&quot; is centered on the fire, with a highly fictionalized portrayal of the O&#x27;Leary family as the main characters.
* A &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot; segment in &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends&quot; featured a bear character named &quot;Stokey&quot; who was hypnotized by the segment&#x27;s villain and lights fires instead of preventing fires. In the end of the segment, Do-Right took Stokey to Chicago to stay with a friend, but the bear ends up starting major fires, with the implication that he started the Great Chicago Fire. The segment was later banned for more than four decades due to protests from the U.S. Forest Service who disliked the parody of &quot;Smokey Bear&quot; shortly after its original airing in 1961. 
* In 1974, the Chicago Fire football team played in the short-lived World Football League. Another Chicago Fire played in the American Football Association.
* The 1976 made-for-TV movie &quot;Time Travelers&quot; has two doctors sent back to 1871 Chicago to find a cure for a disease thought lost to the fire. The Fire is shown starting when flames burst out from the O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s barn and various attempts to stop the fire with a fire carriage and dynamiting buildings are depicted.

* A 1998 episode of the American television series &quot;Early Edition&quot; depicted Gary Hobson finding himself back in time in 1871 trying to prevent the fire. While he initially succeeds and stops the fire after the lantern is kicked over, subsequent events lead to the fire restarting, preserving the historical event while changing its origin.
* The Major League Soccer team Chicago Fire was founded on October 8, 1997, the 126th anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire.

* The Beach Boys&#x27; instrumental track titled &quot;Mrs. O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s Cow&quot; was inspired by the fabled cause of the Great Chicago Fire, and served as the representation for the classical element fire on their abandoned project &quot;Smile&quot;.
* Adopted on April 4, 1917, the flag of Chicago represents the Great Chicago fire with one of the four red stars present on the flag.

<text>Universal grammar (UG), in modern linguistics, is the theory of the innate biological component of the language faculty, usually credited to Noam Chomsky. The basic postulate of UG is that there are innate constraints on what the grammar of a possible human language could be. When linguistic stimuli are received in the course of language acquisition, children then adopt specific syntactic rules that conform to UG. The advocates of this theory emphasize and partially rely on the poverty of the stimulus (POS) argument and the existence of some universal properties of natural human languages. However, the latter has not been firmly established, as some linguists have argued languages are so diverse that such universality is rare, and the theory of universal grammar remains controversial among linguists.

== Overview ==

The term &quot;universal grammar&quot; is placeholder for whichever domain-specific features of linguistic competence turn out to be innate. Within generative grammar, it is generally accepted that there must be some such features, and one of the goals of generative research is to formulate and test hypotheses about which aspects those are. In day-to-day generative research, the notion that universal grammar exists motivates analyses in terms of general principles. As much as possible, facts about particular languages are derived from these general principles rather than from language-specific stipulations.

== Evidence ==

The idea that at least some aspects are innate is motivated by poverty of the stimulus arguments. For example, one famous poverty of the stimulus argument concerns the acquisition of yes-no questions in English. This argument starts from the observation that children only make mistakes compatible with rules targeting hierarchical structure even though the examples which they encounter could have been generated by a simpler rule that targets linear order. In other words, children seem to ignore the possibility that the question rule is as simple as &quot;switch the order of the first two words&quot; and immediately jump to alternatives that rearrange constituents in tree structures. This is taken as evidence that children are born knowing that grammatical rules involve hierarchical structure, even though they have to figure out what those rules are. 

== Theories of universal grammar ==

Within generative grammar, there are a variety of theories about what universal grammar consists of. One notable hypothesis proposed by Hagit Borer holds that the fundamental syntactic operations are universal and that all variation arises from different feature-specifications in the lexicon. On the other hand, a strong hypothesis adopted in some variants of Optimality Theory holds that humans are born with a universal set of constraints, and that all variation arises from differences in how these constraints are ranked. In a 2002 paper, Noam Chomsky, Marc Hauser and W. Tecumseh Fitch proposed that universal grammar consists solely of the capacity for hierarchical phrase structure.

== Relation to the evolution of language ==

In an article entitled &quot;The Faculty of Language: What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve?&quot; Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch present the three leading hypotheses for how language evolved and brought humans to the point where they have a universal grammar.

The first hypothesis states that the faculty of language in the broad sense (FLb) is strictly homologous to animal communication. This means that homologous aspects of the faculty of language exist in non-human animals.

The second hypothesis states that the FLb is a derived and uniquely human adaptation for language. This hypothesis holds that individual traits were subject to natural selection and came to be specialized for humans.

The third hypothesis states that only the faculty of language in the narrow sense (FLn) is unique to humans. It holds that while mechanisms of the FLb are present in both human and non-human animals, the computational mechanism of recursion has evolved recently, and solely in humans. This hypothesis aligns most closely with the typical theory of universal grammar championed by Chomsky.

== Presence of creole languages ==

The presence of creole languages is sometimes cited as further support for this theory, especially by Bickerton&#x27;s controversial language bioprogram theory. Creoles are languages that develop and form when disparate societies with no common language come together and are forced to devise a new system of communication. The system used by the original speakers is typically an inconsistent mix of vocabulary items, known as a pidgin. As these speakers&#x27; children begin to acquire their first language, they use the pidgin input to effectively create their own original language, known as a creole. Unlike pidgins, creoles have native speakers (those with acquisition from early childhood) and make use of a full, systematic grammar.

According to Bickerton, the idea of universal grammar is supported by creole languages because certain features are shared by virtually all in the category. For example, their default point of reference in time (expressed by bare verb stems) is not the present moment, but the past. Using pre-verbal auxiliaries, they uniformly express tense, aspect, and mood. Negative concord occurs, but it affects the verbal subject (as opposed to the object, as it does in languages like Spanish). Another similarity among creoles can be seen in the fact that questions are created simply by changing the intonation of a declarative sentence, not its word order or content.

However, extensive work by Carla Hudson-Kam and Elissa Newport suggests that creole languages may not support a universal grammar at all. In a series of experiments, Hudson-Kam and Newport looked at how children and adults learn artificial grammars. They found that children tend to ignore minor variations in the input when those variations are infrequent, and reproduce only the most frequent forms. In doing so, they tend to standardize the language that they hear around them. Hudson-Kam and Newport hypothesize that in a pidgin-development situation (and in the real-life situation of a deaf child whose parents are or were disfluent signers), children systematize the language they hear, based on the probability and frequency of forms, and not that which has been suggested on the basis of a universal grammar. Further, it seems to follow that creoles would share features with the languages from which they are derived, and thus look similar in terms of grammar.

Many researchers of universal grammar argue against a concept of relexification, which says that a language replaces its lexicon almost entirely with that of another. This goes against universalist ideas of a universal grammar, which has an innate grammar.

== Criticism ==

Recent work has also suggested that some recurrent neural network architectures are able to learn hierarchical structure without an explicit constraint. This shows that it may in fact be possible for human infants to acquire natural language syntax without an explicit universal grammar.

The empirical basis of poverty of the stimulus arguments has been challenged by Geoffrey Pullum and others, leading to back-and-forth debate in the language acquisition literature. 

Language acquisition researcher Michael Ramscar has suggested that when children erroneously expect an ungrammatical form that then never occurs, the repeated failure of expectation serves as a form of implicit negative feedback that allows them to correct their errors over time such as how children correct grammar generalizations like &quot;goed&quot; to &quot;went&quot; through repetitive failure.

In addition, it has been suggested that people learn about probabilistic patterns of word distributions in their language, rather than hard and fast rules (see Distributional hypothesis). For example, children overgeneralize the past tense marker &quot;ed&quot; and conjugate irregular verbs as if they were regular, producing forms like &quot;goed&quot; and &quot;eated&quot; and correct these deviancies over time. It has also been proposed that the poverty of the stimulus problem can be largely avoided, if it is assumed that children employ &quot;similarity-based generalization&quot; strategies in language learning, generalizing about the usage of new words from similar words that they already know how to use.

Neurogeneticists Simon Fisher and Sonja Vernes consider Chomsky&#x27;s &quot;Universal Grammar&quot; as an example of a romantic simplification of genetics and neuroscience. According to them, the link from genes to grammar has not been consistently mapped by scientists. What has been established by research relates primarily to speech pathologies. The arising lack of certainty has provided an audience for unconstrained speculations that have fed the myth of &quot;so-called grammar genes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisher/Vernes&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoffrey Sampson maintains that universal grammar theories are not falsifiable and are therefore pseudoscientific. He argues that the grammatical &quot;rules&quot; linguists posit are simply post-hoc observations about existing languages, rather than predictions about what is possible in a language. Similarly, Jeffrey Elman argues that the unlearnability of languages assumed by universal grammar is based on a too-strict, &quot;worst-case&quot; model of grammar, that is not in keeping with any actual grammar. In keeping with these points, James Hurford argues that the postulate of a language acquisition device (LAD) essentially amounts to the trivial claim that languages are learnt by humans, and thus, that the LAD is less a theory than an explanandum looking for theories.

Morten H. Christiansen and Nick Chater have argued that the relatively fast-changing nature of language would prevent the slower-changing genetic structures from ever catching up, undermining the possibility of a genetically hard-wired universal grammar. Instead of an innate universal grammar, they claim, &quot;apparently arbitrary aspects of linguistic structure may result from general learning and processing biases deriving from the structure of thought processes, perceptuo-motor factors, cognitive limitations, and pragmatics&quot;.

Wolfram Hinzen summarizes the most common criticisms of universal grammar:
* Universal grammar has no coherent formulation
* Universal grammar cannot have evolved by standardly accepted neo-Darwinian evolutionary principles.
* Apparent variation at all levels of linguistic organization, which lies at the heart of human faculty of language.

In the domain of field research, Daniel Everett has claimed that the Pirahã language is a counterexample to the basic tenets of universal grammar because it lacks clausal embedding. According to Everett, this trait results from Pirahã culture emphasizing present-moment concrete matters. Other linguists have responded that Pirahã does in fact have clausal embedding, and that even if it did not this would be irrelevant to current theories of universal grammar.

== History ==

The modern conception of universal grammar is generally attributed to Noam Chomsky. However, similar ideas are found in older work. A related idea is found in Roger Bacon&#x27;s &quot;Overview of Grammar&quot; and &quot;Greek Grammar&quot;, where he postulates that all languages are built upon a common grammar, even though it may undergo incidental variations. In the 13th century, the speculative grammarians postulated universal rules underlying all grammars.

The concept of a universal grammar or language was at the core of the 17th century projects for philosophical languages. An influential work in that time was Grammaire générale by Claude Lancelot and Antoine Arnauld. They tried to describe a general grammar for languages, coming to the conclusion that grammar has to be universal. There is a Scottish school of universal grammarians from the 18th century, as distinguished from the philosophical language project, which included authors such as James Beattie, Hugh Blair, James Burnett, James Harris, and Adam Smith. The article on grammar in the first edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (1771) contains an extensive section titled &quot;Of Universal Grammar&quot;.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Wilhelm Wundt and Otto Jespersen responded to these earlier arguments, arguing that their view of language was overly influenced by Latin and ignored the breadth of worldwide linguistic variation. Jesperson did not fully dispense with the idea of a &quot;universal grammar&quot;, but reduced it to universal syntactic categories or super-categories, such as number, tenses, etc. 

During the rise of behaviorism, the idea of a universal grammar was discarded in light of the idea that language acquisition, like any other kind of learning, could be explained by a succession of trials, errors, and rewards for success. In other words, children learned their mother tongue by simple imitation, through listening and repeating what adults said. For example, when a child says &quot;milk&quot; and the mother will smile and give her child milk as a result, the child will find this outcome rewarding, thus enhancing the child&#x27;s language development. 

In 2016 Chomsky and Berwick co-wrote their book titled &quot;Why Only Us,&quot; where they defined both the minimalist program and the strong minimalist thesis and its implications to update their approach to UG theory. According to Berwick and Chomsky, the strong minimalist thesis states that &quot;The optimal situation would be that UG reduces to the simplest computational principles which operate in accord with conditions of computational efficiency. This conjecture is ... called the Strong Minimalist Thesis (SMT).&quot; The significance of SMT is to significantly shift the previous emphasis on universal grammars to the concept which Chomsky and Berwick now call &quot;merge&quot;. &quot;Merge&quot; is defined in their 2016 book when they state &quot;Every computational system has embedded within it somewhere an operation that applies to two objects X and Y already formed, and constructs from them a new object Z. Call this operation Merge.&quot; SMT dictates that &quot;Merge will be as simple as possible: it will not modify X or Y or impose any arrangement on them; in particular, it will leave them unordered, an important fact... Merge is therefore just set formation: Merge of X and Y yields the set {X, Y}.&quot;

<text>A Munro (; ) is defined as a mountain in Scotland with a height over , and which is on the Scottish Mountaineering Club (SMC) official list of Munros; there is no explicit topographical prominence requirement. The best known Munro is Ben Nevis (Beinn Nibheis), the highest mountain in the British Isles at 4,411 ft (1,345 m).

Munros are named after Sir Hugh Munro, 4th Baronet (1856–1919), who produced the first list of such hills, known as &quot;Munro&#x27;s Tables&quot;, in 1891. Also included were what Munro considered lesser peaks, now known as Munro Tops, which are also over 3,000 feet but are lower than the nearby primary mountain. The publication of the original list is usually considered to be the epoch event of modern peak bagging. The list has been the subject of subsequent variation and , the Scottish Mountaineering Club has listed 282 Munros and 226 Munro Tops.

&quot;Munro bagging&quot; is the activity of climbing all the listed Munros. , 7,654 people had reported completing a round. The first continuous round was completed by Hamish Brown in 1974, whilst the record for the fastest continuous round is held by ultra runner Jamie Aarons, who completed a round in 31 days 10 hours 27 min in June 2023. Furths are mountains in England, Wales or Ireland recognized by the SMC as meeting the Munro classification.

== History ==
Before the publication of &quot;Munro&#x27;s Tables&quot; in 1891, there was much uncertainty about the number of Scottish peaks over 3,000 feet. Estimates ranged from 31 (in M.J.B. Baddeley&#x27;s guides) to 236 (listed in Robert Hall&#x27;s third edition of &quot;The Highland Sportsman and Tourist&quot;, published in 1884). When the Scottish Mountaineering Club was formed in 1889, one of its aims was to remedy this by accurately documenting all of Scotland&#x27;s mountains over 3,000 feet. Sir Hugh Munro, a founding member of the club, took on the task using his own experience as a mountaineer, as well as detailed study of the Ordnance Survey six-inch-to-the-mile (1:10,560) and one-inch-to-the-mile (1:63,360) maps.

Munro researched and produced a set of tables that were published in the Scottish Mountaineering Club Journal in September 1891. The tables listed 538 summits over 3,000 feet, 282 of which were regarded as &quot;separate mountains&quot;. The term &quot;Munro&quot; applies to separate mountains, while the lesser summits are known as &quot;Munro Tops&quot;. Munro did not set any measure of topographic prominence by which a peak qualified as a separate mountain, so there has been much debate about how distinct two hills must be if they are to be counted as two separate Munros.

The Scottish Mountaineering Club has revised the tables, both in response to new height data on Ordnance Survey maps and to address the perceived inconsistency as to which peaks qualify for Munro status. In 1992, the publication of Alan Dawson&#x27;s book &quot;Relative Hills of Britain&quot;, showed that three Munro Tops not already considered summits, had a prominence of more than . Given this they would have qualified as Corbett summits had they been under 3,000 feet. In the 1997 tables these three Munro Tops, on Beinn Alligin, Beinn Eighe and Buachaille Etive Beag, gained full Munro summit status. Dawson&#x27;s book also highlighted a number of significant Munro Tops with as much as of prominence which were not listed as Munro Tops. The 1997 tables promoted five of these to full Munro status.

A total of 197 Munros have a topographic prominence of over and are regarded by peakbaggers as Real Munros. 130 Scottish mountains over 1000m, with a topographic prominence of over have been termed Metric Munros.

Other classification schemes in Scotland, such as the Corbetts and Grahams , require a peak to have a prominence of at least for inclusion. The Munros, however, lack a rigid set of criteria for inclusion, with many summits of lesser prominence listed, principally because their summits are hard to reach.

Between April 2007 and July 2015 the Munro Society re-surveyed twenty mountains and tops that were known to be close to the 3,000 ft figure to determine their height more accurately. On 10 September 2009 the society announced that the mountain Sgùrr nan Ceannaichean, south of Glen Carron, had a height of . Therefore, the Scottish Mountaineering Club removed the Munro status of Sgùrr nan Ceannaichean and this mountain is now a Corbett. In a Summer 2011 height survey by The Munro Society, Beinn a&#x27; Chlaidheimh was found to be and thus short of the Munro mark. On 6 September 2012, the Scottish Mountaineering Club demoted it from Munro to Corbett status. On 26 August 2020, the SMC confirmed that Beinn a&#x27; Chroin West Top at 938m was deleted as a Munro Top and Beinn a&#x27; Chroin East Top became the new Munro Top at 940.1m. The summit height of Beinn a&#x27; Chroin was also changed to 941.4m. As of 10 December 2020, there were 226 Scottish Munro Tops after Stob Coire na Cloiche, a Munro Top to Parent Peak Sgùrr nan Ceathramhnan, was surveyed at 912.5m and was deleted as a Munro Top and downgraded to a Corbett Top.

As of 10 December 2020, the Scottish Mountaineering Club lists 282 Munros and 226 Munro Tops. The current SMC list; totals 508 summits.

== Peak bagging ==

When compared to continental ranges, such as The Alps, Scottish peaks are generally lesser in height. However, walking and climbing in them can still be dangerous and difficult to navigate the recommended routes due to their latitude and exposure to Atlantic and Arctic weather systems. Even in summer, the weather can change quickly in the mountains and conditions can be atrocious; thunderstorms, thick fog, strong winds, driving rain and freezing summit temperatures close to 0°C are not unusual.

Winter ascents of some Munros are serious undertakings due to the unpredictable weather, the likelihood of ice and snow, and poor visibility. Each ascent becomes a test of skill, endurance, and determination, as trekkers navigate through snowdrifts, icy slopes, and unpredictable weather conditions. Some hikers try even unprepared for extreme weather on the exposed tops and fatalities are recorded every year, often resulting from slips on wet rock or ice.

The activity of attempting to climb every Munro is known as &quot;Munro bagging&quot;. Munro-bagging is a form of peak bagging. A walker who has climbed all Munros is entitled to be called a Munroist. Descending a Munro by funicular is known as de-bagging.

===Notable completions===
The Scottish Mountaineering Club maintains a list of walkers who have reported completing the Munros. , there are 7,654 names on the list. (The club uses the spelling &quot;compleator&quot; for someone who has completed the Munros.)

Hugh Munro never completed his own list, missing out on Càrn an Fhidhleir and Càrn Cloich-mhuillin (downgraded to a Munro Top in 1981). Sir Hugh is said to have missed the Inaccessible Pinnacle of Sgùrr Dearg, on the Isle of Skye, which he never climbed. However the &quot;In Pinn&quot;, as it is known colloquially within Scottish mountaineering, was only listed as a Munro Top on his list (despite being several metres higher than Sgùrr Dearg, which was listed as the main Munro Top).

The first &quot;completionist&quot; was to be the Reverend A. E. Robertson, in 1901, later minister at Braes of Rannoch from 1907. However, research has cast doubt on this claim, and it is not certain that he reached the summit of Ben Wyvis. Also it is known that Robertson did not climb the Inaccessible Peak of Sgùrr Dearg. If Robertson is discounted, the first Munroist is Ronald Burn, who completed in 1923. Burn is also (indisputably) the first person to climb all the Munro Tops.

The person with the most rounds of Munros is Steven Fallon from Edinburgh, who has completed 16 rounds as of 1 October 2019.

Chris Smith became the first Member of Parliament to complete the Munros when he reached the summit of Sgùrr nan Coireachan on 27 May 1989.

Ben Fleetwood is probably the youngest person to have completed a round. He climbed the final Munro of his round – Ben More – on 30 August 2011 at the age of 10 years and 3 months. The youngest completionist to have done the round without the presence of a parent or a guardian is probably Andy Nisbet, who finished his round in 1972 aged 18 years and 1 month.

====Continuous rounds====
Hamish Brown did the first continuous self-propelled round of the Munros (except for the Skye and Mull ferries) between 4 April and 24 July 1974 with of ascent and mostly walking – just were on a bicycle. The journey is fully documented in his book &quot;Hamish&#x27;s Mountain Walk&quot;. The average time taken to bag all the Munros is eight years.

In 1984 George Keeping accomplished the first continuous round of the Munros entirely on foot (and ferry) in 135 days. He went on to complete the English and Welsh 3,000 foot peaks in a further 29 days. 

The first reported completion of all the Munros plus the Munro Tops in one continuous expedition was by Chris Townsend in 1996. His trip lasted between 18 May and 12 September (118 days), he covered a distance of ( by bicycle) with of ascent. The round was broken twice for spells at the office, which could be regarded as stretching the meaning of &quot;continuous&quot;.

The first person to complete a winter round (all the Munros in one winter season) was Martin Moran in 1984–85. His journey lasted between 21 December 1984 and 13 March 1985 (83 days), he walked with of ascent. He used motor transport (campervan) to link his walk.

In the winter of 2005–06, Steve Perry completed a continuous unsupported round entirely on foot (and ferry). He is also the first person to have completed two continuous Munro rounds, having also walked Land&#x27;s End to John O&#x27;Groats via every mainland 3,000 ft mountain between 18 February 2003 and 30 September 2003.

====Fastest rounds====
In 1990, international fell runner and maths teacher Hugh Symonds of Sedbergh, Yorkshire, ran all 277 Munros starting from Ben Hope. It took him 66 days and 22 hours. This also included running the other 3,000 foot peaks in Great Britain. Having achieved this in the short time of 83 days, when his target had been a hundred, he decided to add the Republic of Ireland tops to the list and still finished all 303 peaks in 97 days.

In July 1992, Andrew Johnstone of Aberdeen and Rory Gibson of Edinburgh completed their mountain triathlon across the Munros, the 277 Scottish peaks over 3,000 ft, beating the existing record by five days. They began on 29 May and finished at 8.30pm on 15 July on the summit of Ben Hope, the most northerly Munro, completing a journey which began 51 days and 10 hours earlier on the Isle of Mull. After swimming lochs, cycling highland roads and running across some of the most desolate and dangerous terrain in Britain, they covered 1,400 miles.

Charlie Campbell, a former postman from Glasgow, held the record for the fastest round of the Munros between 2000 and 2010. He completed his round in 48 days, 12 hours and 0 minutes, finishing on 16 July 2000, on Ben Hope. He cycled and swam between Munros; no motorised transport was used.

Campbell&#x27;s record was broken by Stephen Pyke of Stone, Staffordshire, in 2010 who completed the round in 39 days, 9 hours and 6 minutes. Pyke&#x27;s round started on the Isle of Mull on 25 April 2010 and finished on Ben Hope in Sutherland on 3 June 2010. He cycled and kayaked between Munros; no motorised transport was used. He was backed by a support team in a motor home, but had to camp out in the more remote areas.

On 18 September 2011, Alex Robinson and Tom O&#x27;Connell finished a self-propelled continuous round on Ben Hope in a time of 48 days, 6 hours and 56 minutes. At the age of just 21, Alex became the youngest person to have completed a continuous round without the use of any motorised transport.

On 17 September 2017, the women&#x27;s self-propelled, continuous record was broken by Libby Kerr and Lisa Trollope in 76 days and 10 hours. This record would later be vastly broken by Jamie Aarons on 26 June 2023 who would also break the record for both the male and female fastest ever round.

On 2 September 2020, Pyke&#x27;s record was broken by Donnie Campbell of Inverness. He completed his round in 31 days, 23 hours and 2 minutes, starting on the Isle of Mull on 1 August 2020 and finished on Ben Hope on 2 September 2020. Campbell ran the 282 Munros and cycled and kayaked between them. On day 29, he was joined by previous record holder Stephen Pyke. Whilst ticking off Mòruisg  in the cloud, he mistook the big cairn for the summit and had to head back up and so climbed the Munro twice. On day 31, he completed 18 Munros. He was supported by a crew travelling in his motorhome, who also shuttled his bike for him to follow a more linear route.

On 26 June 2023, Jamie Aarons of California broke the previous record of fastest ever round held by former marine Donnie Campbell by more than 12 hours by completing a self-propelled continuous round in 31 days, 10 hours and 27 minutes. She also ran, cycled and kayaked between each of the Munros, covering a total of around 932 miles (1,500 km) on foot and about the same distance by bike. She began at Ben More on Mull and ended at Ben Klibreck in Sutherland, raising £14,000 for World Bicycle Relief.

==Furths==
The SMC recognises six peaks in England, fifteen in Wales and thirteen in Ireland that would be Munros or Munro Tops if they were in Scotland. These are referred to as Furth Munros, i.e. the Munros furth of Scotland. The first recorded Furthist is James Parker, who completed on Tryfan (Snowdonia) on 19 April 1929.

<text>Kurdish (, , ) is a Northwestern Iranian language or group of languages spoken by Kurds in the region of Kurdistan, namely in southeast Turkey, northern Iraq, northwest Iran, and northern Syria. It is also spoken in northeast Iran, as well as in certain areas of Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

Kurdish varieties constitute a dialect continuum, with some mutually unintelligible varieties, and collectively have 26 million native speakers. The main varieties of Kurdish are Kurmanji, Sorani, and Southern Kurdish (). The majority of the Kurds speak Kurmanji, and most Kurdish texts are written in Kurmanji and Sorani. Kurmanji is written in the Hawar alphabet, a derivation of the Latin script, and Sorani is written in the Sorani alphabet, a derivation of the Arabic script.

A separate group of non-Kurdish Northwestern Iranian languages, the Zaza–Gorani languages, are also spoken by several million ethnic Kurds.

The classification of Laki as a dialect of Southern Kurdish or as a fourth language under Kurdish is a matter of debate, but the differences between Laki and other Southern Kurdish dialects are minimal.

The literary output in Kurdish was mostly confined to poetry until the early 20th century, when more general literature became developed. Today, the two principal written Kurdish dialects are Kurmanji and Sorani. Sorani is, along with Arabic, one of the two official languages of Iraq and is in political documents simply referred to as &quot;Kurdish&quot;.

==Classification and origin==
The Kurdish varieties belong to the Iranian branch of the Indo-European family. They are generally classified as Northwestern Iranian languages, or by some scholars as intermediate between Northwestern and Southwestern Iranian. Martin van Bruinessen notes that &quot;Kurdish has a strong South-Western Iranian element&quot;, whereas &quot;Zaza and Gurani [...] do belong to the north-west Iranian group&quot;.

Ludwig Paul concludes that Kurdish seems to be a Northwestern Iranian language in origin, but acknowledges that it shares many traits with Southwestern Iranian languages like Persian, apparently due to longstanding and intense historical contacts.

Windfuhr identified Kurdish dialects as Parthian, albeit with a Median substratum. Windfuhr and Frye assume an eastern origin for Kurdish and consider it as related to eastern and central Iranian dialects.

The present state of knowledge about Kurdish allows, at least roughly, drawing the approximate borders of the areas where the main ethnic core of the speakers of the contemporary Kurdish dialects was formed. The most argued hypothesis on the localisation of the ethnic territory of the Kurds remains D.N. Mackenzie&#x27;s theory, proposed in the early 1960s (Mackenzie 1961). Developing the ideas of P. Tedesco (1921: 255) and regarding the common phonetic isoglosses shared by Kurdish, Persian, and Baluchi, Mackenzie concluded that the speakers of these three languages may once have been in closer contact.

== Varieties ==
Kurdish varieties are divided into three or four groups, with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility.

*Kurmanji is the largest dialect group, spoken by an estimated 15 to 20 million Kurds in Turkey, Syria, northern Iraq, and northwest and northeast Iran.
*Sorani is spoken by an estimated 6 to 7 million Kurds in much of Iraqi Kurdistan and the Iranian Kurdistan province. Sorani is a written standard of Central Kurdish developed in the 1920s (named after the historical Soran Emirate) and was later adopted as the standard orthography of Kurdish as an official language of Iraq.
*Southern Kurdish (Pehlewani) is spoken in the Kermanshah, Ilam and Lorestan provinces of Iran and in the Khanaqin District of eastern Iraq. Laki and Kordali (Palai) are often included in Southern Kurdish, but they have some distinct features.

In historical evolution terms, Kurmanji is less modified than Sorani and Pehlewani in both phonetic and morphological structure. The Sorani group has been influenced by among other things its closer cultural proximity to the other languages spoken by Kurds in the region including the Gorani language in parts of Iranian Kurdistan and Iraqi Kurdistan.

Philip G. Kreyenbroek, an expert writing in 1992, says:
According to &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot;, although Kurdish is not a unified language, its many dialects are interrelated and at the same time distinguishable from other Western Iranian languages. The same source classifies different Kurdish dialects as two main groups, northern and central. The average Kurmanji speaker does not find it easy to communicate with the inhabitants of Sulaymaniyah or Halabja.

Some linguistic scholars assert that the term &quot;Kurdish&quot; has been applied extrinsically in describing the language the Kurds speak, whereas some ethnic Kurds have used the word term to simply describe their ethnicity and refer to their language as &quot;Kurmanji&quot;, &quot;Sorani&quot;, &quot;Hewrami&quot;, &quot;Kermanshahi&quot;, &quot;Kalhori&quot; or whatever other dialect or language they speak. Some historians have noted that it is only recently that the Kurds who speak the Sorani dialect have begun referring to their language as &quot;Kurdî&quot;, in addition to their identity, which is translated to simply mean Kurdish.

The Mokriani variety of Sorani is widely spoken in Mokrian. Piranshahr and Mahabad are two principal cities of the Mokrian area.

==Zazaki and Gorani==

Zaza–Gorani languages, which are spoken by communities in the wider area who identify as ethnic Kurds, are not linguistically classified as Kurdish. Zaza-Gorani is classified as adjunct to Kurdish, although authorities differ in the details. groups Kurdish with Zaza Gorani within a &quot;Northwestern I&quot; group, while Glottolog based on &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot; prefers an areal grouping of &quot;Central dialects&quot; (or &quot;Kermanic&quot;) within Northwest Iranic, with Kurdish but not Zaza-Gorani grouped with &quot;Kermanic&quot;.

Gorani is distinct from Northern and Central Kurdish, yet shares vocabulary with both of them and there are some grammatical similarities with Central Kurdish. The Hawrami dialects of Gorani includes a variety that was an important literary language since the 14th century, but it was replaced by Central Kurdish in the 20th century.

European scholars have maintained that Gorani is separate from Kurdish and that Kurdish is synonymous with the Northern Kurdish group, whereas ethnic Kurds maintain that Kurdish encompasses any of the unique languages or dialects spoken by Kurds that are not spoken by neighbouring ethnic groups.

Gorani is classified as part of the Zaza–Gorani branch of Indo-Iranian languages. The Zaza language, spoken mainly in Turkey, differs both grammatically and in vocabulary and is generally not understandable by Gorani speakers but it is considered related to Gorani. Almost all Zaza-speaking communities, as well as speakers of the closely related Shabaki dialect spoken in parts of Iraqi Kurdistan, identify themselves as ethnic Kurds.

Geoffrey Haig and Ergin Öpengin in their recent study suggest grouping the Kurdish languages into Northern Kurdish, Central Kurdish, Southern Kurdish, Zaza, and Gorani, and avoid the subgrouping Zaza–Gorani.

Professor Zare Yusupova has carried out much work and research into the Gorani dialect (as well as many other minority/ancient Kurdish dialects).

==History==
During his stay in Damascus, historian Ibn Wahshiyya came across two books on agriculture written in Kurdish, one on the culture of the vine and the palm tree, and the other on water and the means of finding it out in unknown ground. He translated both from Kurdish into Arabic in the early 9th century AD.

Among the earliest Kurdish religious texts is the &quot;Yazidi Black Book&quot;, the sacred book of Yazidi faith. It is considered to have been authored sometime in the 13th century AD by &quot;Hassan bin Adi&quot; (b. 1195 AD), the great-grandnephew of Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir (d. 1162), the founder of the faith. It contains the Yazidi account of the creation of the world, the origin of man, the story of Adam and Eve and the major prohibitions of the faith. According to &quot;The Cambridge History of the Kurds&quot;, &quot;the first proper &#x27;text written in Kurdish is a short Christian prayer. It was written in Armenian characters, and dates from the fifteenth century. From the 15th to 17th centuries, classical Kurdish poets and writers developed a literary language. The most notable classical Kurdish poets from this period were Ali Hariri, Ahmad Khani, Malaye Jaziri and Faqi Tayran.

The Italian priest Maurizio Garzoni published the first Kurdish grammar titled &quot;Grammatica e Vocabolario della Lingua Kurda&quot; in Rome in 1787 after eighteen years of missionary work among the Kurds of Amadiya. This work is very important in Kurdish history as it is the first acknowledgment of the widespread use of a distinctive Kurdish language. Garzoni was given the title &quot;Father of Kurdology&quot; by later scholars. The Kurdish language was banned in a large portion of Kurdistan for some time. After the 1980 Turkish coup d&#x27;état until 1991 the use of the Kurdish language was illegal in Turkey.

==Current status==
Today, Sorani is an official language in Iraq. In Syria, on the other hand, publishing materials in Kurdish is forbidden, though this prohibition is not enforced any more due to the Syrian civil war.

Before August 2002, the Turkish government placed severe restrictions on the use of Kurdish, prohibiting the language in education and broadcast media. In March 2006, Turkey allowed private television channels to begin airing programming in Kurdish. However, the Turkish government said that they must avoid showing children&#x27;s cartoons, or educational programs that teach Kurdish, and could broadcast only for 45 minutes a day or four hours a week. The state-run Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) started its 24-hour Kurdish television station on 1 January 2009 with the motto &quot;we live under the same sky&quot;. The Turkish prime minister sent a video message in Kurdish to the opening ceremony, which was attended by Minister of Culture and other state officials. The channel uses the &quot;X&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, and &quot;Q&quot; letters during broadcasting. However, most of these restrictions on private Kurdish television channels were relaxed in September 2009. In 2010, Kurdish municipalities in the southeast began printing marriage certificates, water bills, construction and road signs, as well as emergency, social and cultural notices in Kurdish alongside Turkish. Also Imams began to deliver Friday sermons in Kurdish and Esnaf price tags in Kurdish. Many mayors were tried for issuing public documents in Kurdish language. The Kurdish alphabet is not recognized in Turkey, and prior to 2013 the use of Kurdish names containing the letters &quot;X&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, and &quot;Q&quot;, which do not exist in the Turkish alphabet, was not allowed. In 2012, Kurdish-language lessons became an elective subject in public schools. Previously, Kurdish education had only been possible in private institutions.

In Iran, though it is used in some local media and newspapers, it is not used in public schools. In 2005, 80 Syrian and Iranian Kurds took part in an experiment and gained scholarships to study in Kurdistan Region, Iraq, in their native tongue.

In Kyrgyzstan, of the Kurdish population speak Kurdish as their native language. In Kazakhstan, the corresponding percentage is 88.7%.

<text>UTF-16 (16-bit Unicode Transformation Format) is a character encoding that supports all 1,112,064 valid code points of Unicode. The encoding is variable-length as code points are encoded with one or two &quot;code units&quot;. UTF-16 arose from an earlier obsolete fixed-width 16-bit encoding now known as UCS-2 (for 2-byte Universal Character Set), once it became clear that more than 216 (65,536) code points were needed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Unicode.org/faq&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; including most emoji and important CJK characters such as for personal and place names.

UTF-16 is used by the Windows API, and by many programming environments such as Java and Qt. The variable length character of UTF-16, combined with the fact that most characters are &quot;not&quot; variable length (so variable length is rarely tested), has led to many bugs in software, including in Windows itself.

UTF-16 is the only encoding (still) allowed on the web that is incompatible with 8-bit ASCII. However it has never gained popularity on the web, where it is declared by under 0.004% of public web pages (and even then, the web pages are most likely also using UTF-8). UTF-8, by comparison, gained dominance years ago and accounted for 99% of all web pages by 2025. The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) considers UTF-8 &quot;the mandatory encoding for all [text]&quot; and that for security reasons browser applications should not use UTF-16.

== History ==
In the late 1980s, work began on developing a uniform encoding for a &quot;Universal Character Set&quot; (UCS) that would replace earlier language-specific encodings with one coordinated system. The goal was to include all required characters from most of the world&#x27;s languages, as well as symbols from technical domains such as science, mathematics, and music. The original idea was to replace the typical 256-character encodings, which required 1 byte per character, with an encoding using 65,536 (216) values, which would require 2 bytes (16 bits) per character.

Two groups worked on this in parallel, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2 and the Unicode Consortium, the latter representing mostly manufacturers of computing equipment. The two groups attempted to synchronize their character assignments so that the developing encodings would be mutually compatible. The early 2-byte encoding was originally called &quot;Unicode&quot;, but is now called &quot;UCS-2&quot;.

When it became increasingly clear that 216 characters would not suffice,&lt;ref name=&quot;unicode.org/faq&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; IEEE introduced a larger 31-bit space and an encoding (UCS-4) that would require 4 bytes per character. This was resisted by the Unicode Consortium, both because 4 bytes per character wasted a lot of memory and disk space, and because some manufacturers were already heavily invested in 2-byte-per-character technology. The UTF-16 encoding scheme was developed as a compromise and introduced with version 2.0 of the Unicode standard in July 1996. It is fully specified in RFC 2781, published in 2000 by the IETF.

UTF-16 is specified in the latest versions of both the international standard ISO/IEC 10646 and the Unicode Standard. &quot;UCS-2 should now be considered obsolete. It no longer refers to an encoding form in either 10646 or the Unicode Standard.&quot; UTF-16 will never be extended to support a larger number of code points or to support the code points that were replaced by surrogates, as this would violate the Unicode Stability Policy with respect to general category or surrogate code points. (Any scheme that remains a self-synchronizing code would require allocating at least one Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) code point to start a sequence. Changing the purpose of a code point is disallowed.)

== Description ==
Each Unicode &quot;code point&quot; is encoded either as one or two 16-bit &quot;code units&quot;. Code points less than 216 (&quot;in the BMP&quot;) are encoded with a single 16-bit code unit equal to the numerical value of the code point, as in the older UCS-2. Code points greater than or equal to 216 (&quot;above the BMP&quot;) are encoded using &quot;two&quot; 16-bit code units. These two 16-bit code units are chosen from the UTF-16 surrogate range which had not previously been assigned to characters. Values in this range are not used as characters, and UTF-16 provides no legal way to code them as individual code points. A UTF-16 stream, therefore, consists of single 16-bit codes outside the surrogate range, and pairs of 16-bit values that are within the surrogate range.

=== U+0000 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+FFFF ===

Both UTF-16 and UCS-2 encode code points in this range as single 16-bit code units that are numerically equal to the corresponding code points. These code points in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) are the &quot;only&quot; code points that can be represented in UCS-2. As of Unicode 9.0, some modern non-Latin Asian, Middle-Eastern, and African scripts fall outside this range, as do most emoji characters.

=== Code points from U+010000 to U+10FFFF ===
Code points from the other planes are encoded as two 16-bit &quot;code units&quot; called a &quot;surrogate pair&quot;. The first code unit is a &quot;high surrogate&quot; and the second is a &quot;low surrogate&quot; (These are also known as &quot;leading&quot; and &quot;trailing&quot; surrogates, respectively, analogous to the leading and trailing bytes of UTF-8.):

* 0x10000 is subtracted from the code point &quot;(U)&quot;, leaving a 20-bit number &quot;(U&#x27;)&quot; in the hex number range 0x00000–0xFFFFF.
* The high ten bits (in the range 0x000–0x3FF) are added to 0xD800 to give the first 16-bit &quot;code unit&quot; or &quot;high surrogate&quot; &quot;(W1)&quot;, which will be in the range .
* The low ten bits (also in the range 0x000–0x3FF) are added to 0xDC00 to give the second 16-bit &quot;code unit&quot; or &quot;low surrogate&quot; &quot;(W2)&quot;, which will be in the range .

Illustrated visually, the distribution of &quot;U&quot;&#x27; between &quot;W1&quot; and &quot;W2&quot; looks like:
U&#x27; = yyyyyyyyyyxxxxxxxxxx // U - 0x10000
W1 = 110110yyyyyyyyyy // 0xD800 + yyyyyyyyyy
W2 = 110111xxxxxxxxxx // 0xDC00 + xxxxxxxxxx

Since the ranges for the &quot;high surrogates&quot; (), &quot;low surrogates&quot; (), and valid BMP characters (0x0000–0xD7FF, 0xE000–0xFFFF) are disjoint, it is not possible for a surrogate to match a BMP character, or for two adjacent &quot;code units&quot; to look like a legal &quot;surrogate pair&quot;. This simplifies searches a great deal. It also means that UTF-16 is &quot;self-synchronizing&quot; on 16-bit words: whether a code unit starts a character can be determined without examining earlier code units (i.e. the type of &quot;code unit&quot; can be determined by the ranges of values in which it falls). UTF-8 shares these advantages, but many earlier multi-byte encoding schemes (such as Shift JIS and other Asian multi-byte encodings) did not allow unambiguous searching and could only be synchronized by re-parsing from the start of the string. UTF-16 is not self-synchronizing if one byte is lost or if traversal starts at a random byte.

Because the most commonly used characters are all in the BMP, handling of surrogate pairs is often not thoroughly tested. This leads to persistent bugs and potential security holes, even in popular and well-reviewed application software (e.g. ).

=== U+D800 to U+DFFF (surrogates) ===

The official Unicode standard says that no UTF forms, including UTF-16, can encode the surrogate code points. Since these will never be assigned a character, there should be no reason to encode them. However, Windows allows unpaired surrogates in filenames and other places, which generally means they have to be supported by software in spite of their exclusion from the Unicode standard.

UCS-2, UTF-8, and UTF-32 can encode these code points in trivial and obvious ways, and a large amount of software does so, even though the standard states that such arrangements should be treated as encoding errors.

It is possible to unambiguously encode an &quot;unpaired surrogate&quot; (a high surrogate code point not followed by a low one, or a low one not preceded by a high one) in the format of UTF-16 by using a code unit equal to the code point. The result is not valid UTF-16, but the majority of UTF-16 encoder and decoder implementations do this when translating between encodings.

=== Examples ===
To encode U+10437 (𐐷) to UTF-16:

* Subtract 0x10000 from the code point, leaving 0x0437.
* For the high surrogate, shift right by 10 (divide by 0x400), then add 0xD800, resulting in 0x0001 + 0xD800 = 0xD801.
* For the low surrogate, take the low 10 bits (remainder of dividing by 0x400), then add 0xDC00, resulting in 0x0037 + 0xDC00 = 0xDC37.

To decode U+10437 (𐐷) from UTF-16:

* Take the high surrogate (0xD801) and subtract 0xD800, then multiply by 0x400, resulting in 0x0001 × 0x400 = 0x0400.
* Take the low surrogate (0xDC37) and subtract 0xDC00, resulting in 0x37.
* Add these two results together (0x0437), and finally add 0x10000 to get the final code point, 0x10437.

The following table summarizes this conversion, as well as others. The colors indicate how bits from the code point are distributed among the UTF-16 bytes. Additional bits added by the UTF-16 encoding process are shown in black.


== Byte-order encoding schemes ==
UTF-16 and UCS-2 produce a sequence of 16-bit code units. Since most communication and storage protocols are defined for bytes, and each unit thus takes two 8-bit bytes, the order of the bytes may depend on the endianness (byte order) of the computer architecture.

To assist in recognizing the byte order of code units, UTF-16 allows a byte order mark (BOM), a code point with the value U+FEFF, to precede the first actual coded value. (U+FEFF is the invisible zero-width non-breaking space/ZWNBSP character). If the endian architecture of the decoder matches that of the encoder, the decoder detects the 0xFEFF value, but an opposite-endian decoder interprets the BOM as the  value U+FFFE reserved for this purpose. This incorrect result provides a hint to perform byte-swapping for the remaining values.

If the BOM is missing, RFC 2781 recommends that big-endian (BE) encoding be assumed. In practice, due to Windows using little-endian (LE) order by default, many applications assume little-endian encoding. It is also reliable to detect endianness by looking for null bytes, on the assumption that characters less than U+0100 are very common. If more even bytes (starting at 0) are null, then it is big-endian.

The standard also allows the byte order to be stated explicitly by specifying UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE as the encoding type. When the byte order is specified explicitly this way, a BOM is specifically &quot;not&quot; supposed to be prepended to the text, and a U+FEFF at the beginning should be handled as a ZWNBSP character. Most applications ignore a BOM in all cases despite this rule.

For Internet protocols, IANA has approved &quot;UTF-16&quot;, &quot;UTF-16BE&quot;, and &quot;UTF-16LE&quot; as the names for these encodings (the names are case insensitive). The aliases UTF_16 or UTF16 may be meaningful in some programming languages or software applications, but they are not standard names in Internet protocols.

Similar designations, UCS-2BE and UCS-2LE, are used to show versions of UCS-2.

== Size ==
A &quot;character&quot; may use any number of Unicode code points. For instance an emoji flag character takes 8 bytes, since it is &quot;constructed from a pair of Unicode scalar values&quot; (and those values are outside the BMP and require 4 bytes each). UTF-16 in no way assists in &quot;counting characters&quot; or in &quot;measuring the width of a string&quot;.

UTF-16 is often claimed to be more space-efficient than UTF-8 for East Asian languages, since it uses two bytes for characters that take 3 bytes in UTF-8. Since real text contains many spaces, numbers, punctuation, markup (for e.g. web pages), and control characters, which take only one byte in UTF-8, this is only true for artificially constructed dense blocks of text. A more serious claim can be made for Devanagari and Bengali, which use multi-letter words and all the letters take 3 bytes in UTF-8 and only 2 in UTF-16.

In addition the Chinese Unicode encoding standard GB 18030 always produces files the same size or smaller than UTF-16 for all languages, not just for Chinese (it does this by sacrificing self-synchronization).

== Usage ==
UTF-16 is used for text in the OS API of all currently supported versions of Microsoft Windows (and including at least all since Windows CE/2000/XP/2003/Vista/7) including Windows 10. Windows XP and Windows NT prior to Windows 2000 only supported UCS-2. Microsoft has stated that &quot;UTF-16 [..] is a unique burden that Windows places on code that targets multiple platforms&quot; and it has been possible to use UTF-8 API since Windows 10 insider build 17035 in May 2019. Files and network data tend to be a mix of UTF-16, UTF-8, and legacy byte encodings.

SMS text messaging effectively uses UTF-16. The documentation specifies UCS-2 but UTF-16 is necessary for Emoji to work.

The IBM i operating system designates CCSID (code page) 13488 for UCS-2 encoding and CCSID 1200 for UTF-16 encoding, though the system treats them both as UTF-16.

UTF-16 is used by the Qualcomm BREW operating systems; the .NET environments; and the Qt cross-platform graphical widget toolkit.

Symbian OS used in Nokia S60 handsets and Sony Ericsson UIQ handsets uses UCS-2. iPhone handsets use UTF-16 for Short Message Service instead of UCS-2 described in the 3GPP TS 23.038 (GSM) and IS-637 (CDMA) standards.

The Joliet file system, used in CD-ROM media, encodes file names using UCS-2BE (up to sixty-four Unicode characters per file name).

Python version 2.0 officially only used UCS-2 internally, but the UTF-8 decoder to &quot;Unicode&quot; produced correct UTF-16. There was also the ability to compile Python so that it used UTF-32 internally, this was sometimes done on Unix. Python 3.3 switched internal storage to use one of ISO-8859-1, UCS-2, or UTF-32 depending on the largest code point in the string. Python 3.12 drops some functionality (for CPython extensions) to make it easier to migrate to UTF-8 for all strings.

Java originally used UCS-2, and added UTF-16 supplementary character support in J2SE 5.0. Despite awareness of UTF-8 all strings are still UTF-16 (as of Java 9 strings containing only codes less than 256 can be &quot;compressed&quot; to bytes, in ISO-8859-1 encoding).

JavaScript may use UCS-2 or UTF-16. As of ES2015, string methods and regular expression flags have been added to the language that permit handling strings from an encoding-agnostic perspective.

UEFI uses UTF-16 to encode strings by default.

Swift, Apple&#x27;s preferred application language, used UTF-16 to store strings until version 5 which switched to UTF-8.

Quite a few languages make the encoding part of the string object, and thus store and support a large set of encodings including UTF-16. Most consider UTF-16 and UCS-2 to be different encodings. Examples are the PHP language and MySQL.

A method to determine what encoding a system is using internally is to ask for the &quot;length&quot; of string containing a single non-BMP character. If the length is 2 then UTF-16 is being used. 4 indicates UTF-8. 3 or 6 may indicate CESU-8. 1 &quot;may&quot; indicate UTF-32, but more likely indicates the language decodes the string to code points before measuring the &quot;length&quot;.

In many languages, quoted strings need a new syntax for quoting non-BMP characters, as the C-style codice_1 syntax explicitly limits itself to 4 hex digits. The following examples illustrate the syntax for the non-BMP character :
* The most common (C++, C#, D, and several other languages) is an upper-case &#x27;U&#x27; with &quot;8&quot; hex digits such as codice_2.
* Java 7 regular expressions, ICU, and Perl, use codice_3.
* ECMAScript 2015 (JavaScript) uses codice_4.
* In many other cases (such as Java outside of regular expressions), the only way to get non-BMP characters is to enter the surrogate halves individually: codice_5.

<text>Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete, mortar, stucco, and non-specialty grout. It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the early 19th century by Joseph Aspdin, and is usually made from limestone. It is a fine powder, produced by heating limestone and clay minerals in a kiln to form clinker, and then grinding the clinker with the addition of several percent (often around 5%) gypsum. Several types of portland cement are available. The most common, historically called ordinary portland cement (OPC), is grey, but white portland cement is also available. Its name is derived from its resemblance to Portland stone which is quarried on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England. It was named by Joseph Aspdin who obtained a patent for it in 1824. His son William Aspdin is regarded as the inventor of &quot;modern&quot; portland cement due to his developments in the 1840s.

The low cost and widespread availability of the limestone, shales, and other naturally occurring materials used in portland cement make it a relatively cheap building material. Its most common use is in the production of concrete, a composite material consisting of aggregate (gravel and sand), cement, and water.

==History==
Portland cement was developed from natural cements made in Britain beginning in the middle of the 18th century. Its name is derived from its similarity to Portland stone, a type of building stone quarried on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England. The development of modern portland cement (sometimes called ordinary or normal portland cement) began in 1756, when John Smeaton experimented with combinations of different limestones and additives, including trass and pozzolanas, intended for the construction of a lighthouse, now known as Smeaton&#x27;s Tower. In the late 18th century, Roman cement was developed and patented in 1796 by James Parker. Roman cement quickly became popular, but was largely replaced by portland cement in the 1850s. In 1811, James Frost produced a cement he called British cement. James Frost is reported to have erected a manufactory for making of an artificial cement in 1826. In 1811 Edgar Dobbs of Southwark patented a cement of the kind invented 7 years later by the French engineer Louis Vicat. Vicat&#x27;s cement is an artificial hydraulic lime, and is considered the &quot;principal forerunner&quot; of portland cement.

The name &quot;portland cement&quot; is recorded in a directory published in 1823 being associated with a William Lockwood and possibly others. In his 1824 cement patent, Joseph Aspdin called his invention &quot;portland cement&quot; because of its resemblance to Portland stone. Aspdin&#x27;s cement was nothing like modern portland cement, but a first step in the development of modern portland cement, and has been called a &quot;proto-portland cement&quot;.
William Aspdin had left his father&#x27;s company, to form his own cement manufactury. In the 1840s William Aspdin, apparently accidentally, produced calcium silicates which are a middle step in the development of portland cement. In 1848, William Aspdin further improved his cement. Then, in 1853, he moved to Germany, where he was involved in cement making. William Aspdin made what could be called &quot;meso-portland cement&quot; (a mix of portland cement and hydraulic lime). Isaac Charles Johnson further refined the production of &quot;meso-portland cement&quot; (middle stage of development), and claimed to be the real father of portland cement.

In 1859, John Grant of the Metropolitan Board of Works, set out requirements for cement to be used in the London sewer project. This became a specification for portland cement. The next development in the manufacture of portland cement was the introduction of the rotary kiln, patented by Frederick Ransome in 1885 (U.K.) and 1886 (U.S.); which allowed a stronger, more homogeneous mixture and a continuous manufacturing process. The Hoffmann &quot;endless&quot; kiln which was said to give &quot;perfect control over combustion&quot; was tested in 1860 and shown to produce a superior grade of cement. This cement was made at the Portland Cementfabrik Stern at Stettin, which was the first to use a Hoffmann kiln. The Association of German Cement Manufacturers issued a standard on portland cement in 1878.

Portland cement had been imported into the United States from England and Germany, and in the 1870s and 1880s, it was being produced by Eagle Portland cement near Kalamazoo, Michigan. In 1875, the first portland cement was produced in the Coplay Cement Company Kilns under the direction of David O. Saylor in Coplay, Pennsylvania. By the early 20th century, American-made portland cement had displaced most of the imported portland cement.

==Composition==
ASTM C219 defines portland cement as:

 The European Standard EN 197-1 uses the following definition:

(The last two requirements were already set out in the German Standard, issued in 1909).

Clinkers make up more than 90% of the cement, along with a limited amount of calcium sulphate (CaSO4, which controls the set time), and up to 5% minor constituents (fillers) as allowed by various standards. Clinkers are nodules (diameters, ) of a sintered material that is produced when a raw mixture of predetermined composition is heated to high temperature. The key chemical reaction distinguishing portland cement from other hydraulic limes occurs at these high temperatures (&gt;) as belite (Ca2SiO4) combines with calcium oxide (CaO) to form alite (Ca3SiO5).

==Manufacturing==

Portland cement clinker is made by heating, in a cement kiln, a mixture of raw materials to a calcining temperature of above and then a fusion temperature, which is about for modern cements, to sinter the materials into clinker.

The materials in cement clinker are alite, belite, tricalcium aluminate, and tetracalcium alumino ferrite. The aluminium, iron, and magnesium oxides are present as a flux allowing the calcium silicates to form at a lower temperature, and contribute little to the strength. For special cements, such as low heat (LH) and sulphate resistant (SR) types, it is necessary to limit the amount of tricalcium aluminate (3 CaO·Al2O3) formed.

The major raw material for the clinker-making is usually limestone (CaCO3) mixed with a second material containing clay as source of alumino-silicate. Normally, an impure limestone which contains clay or SiO2 is used. The CaCO3 content of these limestones can be as low as 80%. Secondary raw materials (materials in the raw mix other than limestone) depend on the purity of the limestone. Some of the materials used are clay, shale, sand, iron ore, bauxite, fly ash, and slag. When a cement kiln is fired by coal, the ash of the coal acts as a secondary raw material.

===Cement grinding===
To achieve the desired setting qualities in the finished product, a quantity (2–8%, but typically 5%) of calcium sulphate (usually gypsum or anhydrite) is added to the clinker, and the mixture is finely ground to form the finished cement powder. This is achieved in a cement mill. The grinding process is controlled to obtain a powder with a broad particle size range, in which typically 15% by mass consists of particles below 5 μm diameter, and 5% of particles above 45 μm. The measure of fineness usually used is the &#x27;specific surface area&#x27;, which is the total particle surface area of a unit mass of cement. The rate of initial reaction (up to 24 hours) of the cement on addition of water is directly proportional to the specific surface area. Typical values are 320–380 m2·kg−1 for general purpose cements, and 450–650 m2·kg−1 for &#x27;rapid hardening&#x27; cements. The cement is conveyed by belt or powder pump to a silo for storage. Cement plants normally have sufficient silo space for one to 20 weeks of production, depending upon local demand cycles. The cement is delivered to end users either in bags, or as bulk powder blown from a pressure vehicle into the customer&#x27;s silo. In industrial countries, 80% or more of cement is delivered in bulk.

==Setting and hardening==
Cement sets when mixed with water by way of a complex series of chemical reactions that are still only partly understood. A brief summary is as follows:

The clinker phases - calcium silicates and aluminates - dissolve into the water that is mixed with the cement, which results in a fluid containing relatively high concentrations of dissolved ions. This reaches supersaturation with respect to specific mineral phases - usually first ettringite, and then calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) - which precipitate as newly formed solids. The interlocking of the C-S-H (which is crystallographically disordered, and can take on needle or crumpled-foil morphologies) and the ettringite crystals gives cement its initial setting, converting the fluid into a solid, and chemically incorporating much of the water into these new phases.

Gypsum is included in the cement as an inhibitor to prevent flash (or quick) setting; if gypsum is not present, the initial formation of (needle-shaped) ettringite is not possible, and so (plate-shaped) hydrocalumite-group (&quot;AFm&quot;) calcium aluminate phases form instead. This premature formation of AFm phases causes a rapid loss of flowability, which is generally not desirable because it means that placement of the cement or concrete is very difficult. 

Hardening of the cement then proceeds through further C-S-H formation, as this fills in the spaces between the (still-dissolving) cement grains with newly formed solid phases. Portlandite also precipitates from the pore solution to form part of the solid microstructure, and some of the initially-formed ettringite may be converted to AFm phases, releasing part of the sulfate from its structure to continue reacting with any remaining tricalcium aluminate

==Use==

The most common use for portland cement is in the production of concrete. Concrete is a composite material consisting of aggregate (gravel and sand), cement, and water. As a construction material, concrete can be cast in almost any shape desired, and once hardened, can become a structural (load bearing) element. Concrete can be used in the construction of structural elements like panels, beams, and street furniture, or may be cast-&quot;in situ&quot; for superstructures like roads and dams. These may be supplied with concrete mixed on site, or may be provided with &#x27;ready-mixed&#x27; concrete made at permanent mixing sites. Portland cement is also used in mortars (with sand and water only), for plasters and screeds, and in grouts (cement/water mixes squeezed into gaps to consolidate foundations, road-beds, etc.).

When water is mixed with portland cement, the product sets in a few hours and hardens over a period of weeks. These processes can vary widely, depending upon the mix used and the conditions of curing of the product, but a typical concrete sets in about 6 hours and develops a compressive strength of 8 MPa in 24 hours. The strength rises to 15 MPa at 3 days, 23 MPa at 1 week, 35 MPa at 4 weeks, and 41 MPa at 3 months. In principle, the strength continues to rise slowly as long as water is available for continued hydration, but concrete is usually allowed to dry out after a few weeks and this causes strength growth to stop.

==Types==
===General===

===ASTM C150===
Five types of portland cements exist, with variations of the first three according to ASTM C150.

&quot;Type I&quot; portland cement is known as common or general-purpose cement. It is generally assumed unless another type is specified. It is commonly used for general construction, especially when making precast, and precast-prestressed concrete that is not to be in contact with soils or ground water. The typical compound compositions of this type are:

55% (C3S), 19% (C2S), 10% (C3A), 7% (C4AF), 2.8% MgO, 2.9% (SO3), 1.0% ignition loss, and 1.0% free CaO (utilizing cement chemist notation).

A limitation on the composition is that the (C3A) shall not exceed 15%.

&quot;Type II&quot; provides moderate sulphate resistance, and gives off less heat during hydration. This type of cement costs about the same as type I. Its typical compound composition is:

51% (C3S), 24% (C2S), 6% (C3A), 11% (C4AF), 2.9% MgO, 2.5% (SO3), 0.8% ignition loss, and 1.0% free CaO.

A limitation on the composition is that the (C3A) shall not exceed 8%, which reduces its vulnerability to sulphates. This type is for general construction exposed to moderate sulphate attack, and is meant for use when concrete is in contact with soils and ground water, especially in the western United States due to the high sulphur content of the soils. Because of similar price to that of type I, type II is much used as a general purpose cement, and the majority of portland cement sold in North America meets this specification.

Note: Cement meeting (among others) the specifications for types I and II has become commonly available on the world market.

&quot;Type III&quot; has relatively high early strength. Its typical compound composition is:

57% (C3S), 19% (C2S), 10% (C3A), 7% (C4AF), 3.0% MgO, 3.1% (SO3), 0.9% ignition loss, and 1.3% free CaO.

This cement is similar to type I, but ground finer. Some manufacturers make a separate clinker with higher C3S and/or C3A content, but this is increasingly rare, and the general purpose clinker is usually used, ground to a specific surface area typically 50–80% higher. The gypsum level may also be increased a small amount. This gives the concrete using this type of cement a three-day compressive strength equal to the seven-day compressive strength of types I and II. Its seven-day compressive strength is almost equal to 28-day compressive strengths of types I and II. The only downside is that the six-month strength of type III is the same or slightly less than that of types I and II. Therefore, the long-term strength is sacrificed. It is usually used for precast concrete manufacture, where high one-day strength allows fast turnover of molds. It may also be used in emergency construction and repairs, and construction of machine bases and gate installations.

&quot;Type IV&quot; portland cement is generally known for its low heat of hydration. Its typical compound composition is:

28% (C3S), 49% (C2S), 4% (C3A), 12% (C4AF), 1.8% MgO, 1.9% (SO3), 0.9% ignition loss, and 0.8% free CaO.

The percentages of (C2S) and (C4AF) are relatively high and (C3S) and (C3A) are relatively low. A limitation on this type is that the maximum percentage of (C3A) is seven, and the maximum percentage of (C3S) is thirty-five. This causes the heat given off by the hydration reaction to develop at a slower rate. Consequently, the strength of the concrete develops slowly. After one or two years the strength is higher than the other types after full curing. This cement is used for very large concrete structures, such as dams, which have a low surface to volume ratio. This type of cement is generally not stocked by manufacturers, but some might consider a large special order. This type of cement has not been made for many years, because portland-pozzolan cements and ground granulated blast furnace slag addition offer a cheaper and more reliable alternative.

&quot;Type V&quot; is used where sulphate resistance is important. Its typical compound composition is:

38% (C3S), 43% (C2S), 4% (C3A), 9% (C4AF), 1.9% MgO, 1.8% (SO3), 0.9% ignition loss, and 0.8% free CaO.

This cement has a very low (C3A) composition which accounts for its high sulphate resistance. The maximum content of (C3A) allowed is 5% for type V portland cement. Another limitation is that the (C4AF) + 2(C3A) composition cannot exceed 20%. This type is used in concrete to be exposed to alkali soil and ground water sulphates which react with (C3A) causing disruptive expansion. It is unavailable in many places, although its use is common in the western United States and Canada. As with type IV, type V portland cement has mainly been supplanted by the use of ordinary cement with added ground granulated blast furnace slag or tertiary blended cements containing slag and fly ash.

&quot;Types Ia&quot;, &quot;IIa&quot;, and &quot;IIIa&quot; have the same composition as types I, II, and III. The only difference is that in Ia, IIa, and IIIa, an air-entraining agent is ground into the mix. The air-entrainment must meet the minimum and maximum optional specification found in the ASTM manual. These types are only available in the eastern United States and Canada, only on a limited basis. They are a poor approach to air-entrainment which improves resistance to freezing under low temperatures.

&quot;Types II(MH)&quot; and &quot;II(MH)a&quot; have a similar composition as types II and IIa, but with a mild heat.

===EN 197 norm===
The European norm EN 197-1 defines five classes of common cement that comprise portland cement as a main constituent. These classes differ from the ASTM classes.
&quot;Constituents that are permitted in portland-composite cements are artificial pozzolans (blast furnace slag (in fact a latent hydraulic binder), silica fume, and fly ashes), or natural pozzolans (siliceous or siliceous aluminous materials such as volcanic ash glasses, calcined clays and shale).&quot;

===CSA A3000-08===
The Canadian standards describe six main classes of cement, four of which can also be supplied as a blend containing ground limestone (where a suffix L is present in the class names).

===White portland cement===
White portland cement or white ordinary portland cement (WOPC) is similar to ordinary gray portland cement in all respects, except for its high degree of whiteness. Obtaining this colour requires high purity raw materials (low Fe2O3 content), and some modification to the method of manufacture, among others a higher kiln temperature required to sinter the clinker in the absence of ferric oxides acting as a flux in normal clinker. As Fe2O3 contributes to decrease the melting point of the clinker (normally 1450 °C), the white cement requires a higher sintering temperature (around 1600 °C). Because of this, it is somewhat more expensive than the grey product. The main requirement is to have a low iron content which should be less than 0.5 wt.% expressed as Fe2O3 for white cement, and less than 0.9 wt.% for off-white cement. It also helps to have the iron oxide as ferrous oxide (FeO) which is obtained via slightly reducing conditions in the kiln, i.e., operating with zero excess oxygen at the kiln exit. This gives the clinker and cement a green tinge. Other metallic oxides such as Cr2O3 (green), MnO (pink), TiO2 (white), etc., in trace content, can also give colour tinges, so for a given project it is best to use cement from a single batch.

==Safety issues==
Bags of cement routinely have health and safety warnings printed on them, because not only is cement highly alkaline, but the setting process is also exothermic. As a result, wet cement is strongly caustic and can easily cause severe skin burns if not promptly washed off with water. Similarly, dry cement powder in contact with mucous membranes can cause severe eye or respiratory irritation. The reaction of cement dust with moisture in the sinuses and lungs can also cause a chemical burn, as well as headaches, fatigue, and lung cancer.

The production of comparatively low-alkalinity cements (pH&lt;11) is an area of ongoing investigation.

In Scandinavia, France, and the United Kingdom, the level of chromium(VI), which is considered to be toxic and a major skin irritant, may not exceed 2 parts per million (ppm).

In the US, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for portland cement exposure in the workplace as 50 mppcf (million particles per cubic foot) over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 10 mg/m3 total exposure and 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 5000 mg/m3, portland cement is immediately dangerous to life and health.

==Environmental effects==

Portland cement manufacture can cause environmental impacts at all stages of the process. These include emissions of airborne pollution in the form of dust; gases; noise and vibration when operating machinery and during blasting in quarries; consumption of large quantities of fuel during manufacture; release of from the raw materials during manufacture, and damage to countryside from quarrying. Equipment to reduce dust emissions during quarrying and manufacture of cement is widely used, and equipment to trap and separate exhaust gases are coming into increased use. Environmental protection also includes the re-integration of quarries into the countryside after they have been closed down by returning them to nature or re-cultivating them.

Portland cement is caustic, so it can cause chemical burns. The powder can cause irritation or, with severe exposure, lung cancer, and can contain a number of hazardous components, including crystalline silica and hexavalent chromium. Environmental concerns are the high energy consumption required to mine, manufacture, and transport the cement, and the related air pollution, including the release of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, dioxin, , , and particulates. Production of portland cement contributes about 10% of world carbon dioxide emissions. The International Energy Agency has estimated that cement production will increase by between 12 and 23% by 2050 to meet the needs of the world&#x27;s growing population. There are several ongoing researches targeting a suitable replacement of portland cement by supplementary cementitious materials.

&quot;Epidemiologic Notes and Reports Sulfur Dioxide Exposure in Portland Cement Plants&quot;, from the Centers for Disease Control, states:

An independent research effort of AEA Technology to identify critical issues for the cement industry today concluded the most important environment, health and safety performance issues facing the cement industry are atmospheric releases (including greenhouse gas emissions, dioxin, , , and particulates), accidents, and worker exposure to dust.

The associated with portland cement manufacture comes mainly from four sources:
Overall, with nuclear or hydroelectric power, and efficient manufacturing, generation can be reduced to per kg cement, but can be twice as high. The thrust of innovation for the future is to reduce sources 1 and 2 by modification of the chemistry of cement, by the use of wastes, and by adopting more efficient processes. Although cement manufacturing is clearly a very large emitter, concrete (of which cement makes up about 15%) compares quite favourably with other modern building systems in this regard.. Traditional materials such as lime based mortars as well as timber and earth based construction methods emit significantly less .

==Cement plants used for waste disposal or processing==

Due to the high temperatures inside cement kilns, combined with the oxidising (oxygen-rich) atmosphere and long residence times, cement kilns are used as a processing option for various types of waste streams; indeed, they efficiently destroy many hazardous organic compounds. The waste streams also often contain combustible materials which allow the substitution of part of the fossil fuel normally used in the process.

Waste materials used in cement kilns as a fuel supplement:

*Car and truck tires – steel belts are easily tolerated in the kilns
*Paint sludge from automobile industries
*Waste solvents and lubricants
*Meat and bone meal – slaughterhouse waste due to bovine spongiform encephalopathy contamination concerns
*Waste plastics
*Sewage sludge
*Rice hulls
*Sugarcane waste
*Used wooden railroad ties (railway sleepers)
*Spent cell liner from the aluminium smelting industry (also called spent pot liner)

Portland cement manufacture also has the potential to benefit from using industrial byproducts from the waste stream. These include in particular:
*Slag
*Fly ash (from power plants)
*Silica fume (from steel mills)
*Synthetic gypsum (from desulphurisation)

<text>Sarah Elizabeth Hughes (born May 2, 1985) is an American former competitive figure skater. She is the 2002 Olympic Champion and the 2001 World bronze medalist in ladies&#x27; singles.

==Personal life==
Hughes was born in Great Neck, New York, a suburb on Long Island. Her father, John Hughes, was a Canadian of Irish descent and was one of the captains of the undefeated and untied NCAA champion 1969–70 Cornell University ice hockey team. Her mother, Amy Pastarnack, is Jewish and is a breast cancer survivor. This led Hughes to become an advocate for breast cancer awareness. She appeared in a commercial for General Electric promoting breast cancer awareness and research. Hughes stated, &quot;I always said that if I can get one person to get a mammogram, I&#x27;ve accomplished something.&quot; Among the other causes Hughes supports is Figure Skating in Harlem, which provides free ice skating lessons and academic tutoring for girls in the Harlem community in New York City. Hughes has supported this program for over ten years.

Hughes attended Great Neck North High School. In 2003, she began her studies at Yale University where she was in Timothy Dwight College. On May 25, 2009, Hughes graduated from Yale and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in American studies with a concentration in U.S. politics and communities. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School on May 15, 2018. As of May 2023, Hughes was pursuing a business degree at Stanford University.

Hughes had previously dated former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s son Andrew Giuliani in 2011, whom she befriended in 2005.

Hughes is the fourth of six children. One of her younger sisters, Emily, is also a figure skater and competed at the 2006 Winter Olympics. She is the cousin of Gregg &quot;Opie&quot; Hughes, from the &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot; radio show.

==Skating career==
Hughes began skating at the age of three. Robin Wagner, who also choreographed for her from 1994, became her head coach in January 1998.

Hughes won the junior title at the 1998 U.S. Championships in the 1997–1998 season. The following season, she competed on the ISU Junior Grand Prix and won the silver medal at the 1998–1999 Junior Grand Prix Final. She also took silver at the 1999 World Junior Championships held in November 1998. At the 1999 U.S. Championships, Hughes won the pewter medal in her senior-level debut. As the fourth-place finisher, Hughes would not normally have received one of the three spots for U.S. ladies at the 1999 World Championships, however, Naomi Nari Nam, the silver medalist, was not age-eligible for the event according to ISU rules. Hughes was likewise not age-eligible, but at the time a loophole existed for skaters who had medaled at Junior Worlds. Hughes was sent to senior Worlds and finished 7th in her debut.

In the 1999–2000 season, Hughes made her Grand Prix debut, winning the bronze medal at the 1999 Trophée Lalique. She won the bronze medal at the 2000 U.S. Championships and was credited with a triple-salchow-triple-loop combination. She placed 5th at the 2000 World Championships.

On September 7, 2001, at the age of 16, Hughes was invited to meet United States National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice.

In the 2000–2001 season, Hughes won three medals on the Grand Prix circuit and won the bronze medal at the 2000–2001 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final. She won the silver medal at the 2001 U.S. Championships. At the 2001 World Championships, she won the bronze medal.

In the 2001–2002 season, Hughes again competed on the Grand Prix, winning the 2001 Skate Canada International while placing second at her other two events. She won her second consecutive bronze medal at the Grand Prix Final and won the bronze medal at the 2002 U.S. Championships to qualify for the 2002 Winter Olympics.

The week before the opening of the 2002 Olympics, Hughes appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

At the 2002 Olympics, Hughes won the gold medal in what was widely considered one of the biggest upsets in figure skating history. She was the youngest skater in the competition, and was not expected to seriously challenge the favorites, teammate Michelle Kwan and Russia&#x27;s Irina Slutskaya. Hughes became the first woman in Olympic history to land two triple jump-triple jump combinations in a 4-minute free skate. Kwan, Slutskaya, and Sasha Cohen (the three skaters that finished ahead of Hughes in the short program), all made significant mistakes in the free skate, clearing the way for Hughes to win gold. Her Lutz jump was flawed, but her difficult and successful jump combinations made up for it. Her artistry, above-average edge quality, and ice coverage combined to establish her as a &quot;strong all-around skater&quot; and ensured her gold-medal win.
After her Olympic win, Hughes was honored with a parade in her hometown of Great Neck, attended by U.S. Senators Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer, as well as Governor of New York George Pataki. Clinton spoke at the event and declared it Sarah Hughes Day. She received the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the U.S., becoming the third figure skater to win this award after Dick Button (1949) and Michelle Kwan (2001).

Hughes did not compete at the 2002 World Championships. In the 2002–2003 season, she won the silver medal at the 2003 U.S. Championships, and placed sixth at the 2003 World Championships.

Hughes took the 2004–2005 year off from college and skated professionally with the Smuckers Stars on Ice tour company. She was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.

Richard Krawiec wrote a biography about her, &quot;Sudden Champion: The Sarah Hughes Story&quot; (2002).

==Skating technique==
Hughes employed a variety of triple-triple jump combinations, including a triple loop-triple loop, triple salchow-triple loop, and a triple toe-triple loop. She would also perform the triple loop jump which she often completed out of and following a back spiral. She was known for her camel spin with a change of edge as well as her spiral position. Unlike most skaters, she executed jumps and spins clockwise.

==Politics==

On May 15, 2023, Hughes filed paperwork to run for Congress as a Democrat in New York&#x27;s 4th congressional district. She withdrew from the race on September 9.

<doc id="40321" wikidata="Q174817" url="?curid=40321" title="Soundgarden">
<text>Soundgarden was an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1984 by singer and drummer Chris Cornell, lead guitarist Kim Thayil, and bassist Hiro Yamamoto. Cornell switched to rhythm guitar in 1985, replaced on drums initially by Scott Sundquist, and later by Matt Cameron in 1986. Yamamoto left in 1989 and was replaced initially by Jason Everman and shortly thereafter by Ben Shepherd. The band dissolved in 1997 and reformed in 2010. Following Cornell&#x27;s death in 2017, Thayil declared in October 2018 that Soundgarden would not continue, though they did reunite in January 2019 for a one-off concert in tribute to Cornell. Cornell, Thayil, and Cameron appeared on all of the band&#x27;s studio albums.

Soundgarden was one of the pioneers of grunge music, a style of alternative rock that developed in the American Pacific Northwest in the mid-1980s, and helped to popularize it in the early 1990s, alongside such Seattle contemporaries as Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Nirvana. They were the first of a number of grunge bands to sign to the Seattle-based record label Sub Pop, through which they released two EPs: &quot;Screaming Life&quot; (1987) and &quot;Fopp&quot; (1988). Soundgarden&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Ultramega OK&quot;, was also released in 1988 by the California-based independent label SST Records; although the album did not sell well nationally, it garnered critical acclaim and was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1990. Their second album, &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;, was recorded independently, but after they signed with A&amp;M Records in 1989 (making them one of the first grunge bands to sign to a major label), it became their major-label debut. While &quot;Ultramega OK&quot; had failed to chart and &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; peaked at number 108 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, the band&#x27;s third album &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; (1991) was buoyed by the success of the singles &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot;, &quot;Outshined&quot;, and &quot;Rusty Cage&quot;, reached number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and has been certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Soundgarden achieved its biggest success with their fourth album &quot;Superunknown&quot; (1994), which debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and yielded the Grammy Award-winning singles &quot;Spoonman&quot; and &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;. The band experimented with new sonic textures on their follow-up album &quot;Down on the Upside&quot; (1996), which debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spawned several hit singles of its own, including &quot;Pretty Noose&quot;, &quot;Burden in My Hand&quot; and &quot;Blow Up the Outside World&quot;. In 1997, the band broke up due to internal strife over its creative direction and exhaustion from touring. After more than a decade of working on projects and other bands, they reunited in 2010. Republic Records released their sixth and final studio album, &quot;King Animal&quot;, in 2012.

As of 2019, Soundgarden had sold more than 14 million records in the United States, and an estimated 30 million worldwide. VH1 ranked Soundgarden at number 14 in their special, &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.

==History==

===Formation and early recordings (1984–1988)===

Soundgarden&#x27;s origins began with a band called the Shemps, which performed around Seattle in the early 1980s, and featured bassist Hiro Yamamoto and drummer and singer Chris Cornell. Following Yamamoto&#x27;s departure, the band recruited guitarist Kim Thayil as its new bassist. Thayil moved to Seattle from Park Forest, Illinois, with Yamamoto and Bruce Pavitt, who would later start the independent record label Sub Pop. Cornell and Yamamoto stayed in contact, and after the Shemps broke up Cornell and Yamamoto started jamming together, and were eventually joined by Thayil.

Soundgarden was formed in 1984 and included Cornell (drums and vocals), Yamamoto (bass), and Thayil (guitar). The band named themselves after a wind-channeling pipe sculpture titled &quot;A Sound Garden&quot;, on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration property at 7600 Sand Point Way, next to Magnuson Park in Seattle. Cornell originally played drums while singing, but in 1985 the band enlisted Scott Sundquist to allow Cornell to concentrate on vocals. The band traveled around playing various concerts with this lineup for about a year. Their first recordings were three songs that appeared on the 1986 compilation album for C/Z Records called &quot;Deep Six&quot;: &quot;Heretic&quot;, &quot;Tears to Forget&quot; and &quot;All Your Lies&quot;. It also featured songs by fellow grunge pioneers Green River, Skin Yard, Malfunkshun, the U-Men, and the Melvins. In 1986, Cornell&#x27;s then-girlfriend and future wife, Susan Silver started managing Soundgarden. In the same year, Sundquist left the band to spend time with his family and was replaced by former Skin Yard drummer Matt Cameron.
A Soundgarden performance one night impressed KCMU DJ Jonathan Poneman who later said: &quot;I saw this band that was everything rock music should be.&quot; Poneman offered to fund a release by the band, so Thayil suggested he team up with Bruce Pavitt. Poneman offered to contribute $20,000 in funding for Sub Pop, effectively turning it into a full-fledged record label. Soundgarden signed to Sub Pop, and the label released &quot;Hunted Down&quot; in 1987 as the band&#x27;s first single. The B-side of &quot;Hunted Down&quot;, &quot;Nothing to Say&quot;, appeared on the KCMU compilation tape &quot;Bands That Will Make Money&quot;, which was distributed to record companies, many of whom showed interest in Soundgarden. Through Sub Pop, the band released the &quot;Screaming Life&quot; EP in 1987, and the &quot;Fopp&quot; EP in 1988, and a combination of the two, &quot;Screaming Life/Fopp&quot;, in 1990.

===&quot;Ultramega OK&quot;, major label signing, and &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; (1988–1990)===
Though major labels were courting the band, in 1988 they signed to the independent label SST Records for their debut album, &quot;Ultramega OK&quot;, released on October 31, 1988. Cornell said the band &quot;made a huge mistake with &quot;Ultramega OK&quot;&quot; because they used a producer suggested by SST who &quot;didn&#x27;t know what was happening in Seattle.&quot; According to Steve Huey of AllMusic, Soundgarden demonstrates, a &quot;Stooges/MC5-meets-Zeppelin/Sabbath sound&quot; on the album. Mark Miremont directed the band&#x27;s first music video for &quot;Flower&quot;, which aired regularly on MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. Soundgarden promoted &quot;Ultramega OK&quot; on a tour in the United States in the spring of 1989, and a tour in Europe which began in May 1989—the band&#x27;s first overseas tour. &quot;Ultramega OK&quot; earned the band a Grammy Award nomination for Best Metal Performance in 1990.

After touring to promote &quot;Ultramega OK&quot;, the band signed with A&amp;M Records, which caused a rift between Soundgarden and its traditional audience. Thayil said, &quot;In the beginning, our fans came from the punk rock crowd. They abandoned us when they thought we sold out the punk tenets, getting on a major label and touring with Guns N&#x27; Roses. There were fashion issues and social issues, and people thought we no longer belonged to their scene, to their particular sub-culture.&quot; The band later began work on its first album for a major label, but personnel difficulties caused a shift in the band&#x27;s songwriting process. According to Cornell, &quot;At the time Hiro [Yamamoto] excommunicated himself from the band and there wasn&#x27;t a free-flowing system as far as music went, so I ended up writing a lot of it.&quot; On September 5, 1989, the band released its debut major-label album, &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;, which saw it take &quot;a step toward the metal mainstream&quot;, according to Steve Huey of AllMusic, describing it as &quot;a slow, grinding, detuned mountain of Sabbath/Zeppelin riffs and Chris Cornell wailing&quot;. Because of some of the lyrics, most notably on &quot;Hands All Over&quot; and &quot;Big Dumb Sex&quot;, the band faced various retail and distribution problems upon the album&#x27;s release. &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; became the band&#x27;s first album to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number 108 on the chart in 1990.

A month before touring for &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; was to begin, bassist Hiro Yamamoto, who was becoming frustrated that he was not making much of a contribution, left the band to return to college. First the band played a few rehearsals with Jim Tillman from the U-Men, but it did not work, and soon Jason Everman, formerly of Nirvana, officially replaced Hiro Yamamoto on bass. The band toured North America from December 1989 to March 1990, opening for Voivod, who were supporting their album &quot;Nothingface&quot;, with Faith No More and the Big F also serving as opening acts at the beginning and end of the tour. The band then went on to tour Europe. The band fired Everman in mid-1990 immediately after completing its promotional tour for &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;. Thayil said that &quot;Jason just didn&#x27;t work out.&quot; &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; spawned the EP &quot;Loudest Love&quot; and the video compilation &quot;Louder Than Live&quot;, both released in 1990.

===Established lineup, &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;, and rise in popularity (1990–1993)===
Bassist Ben Shepherd replaced Jason Everman and the new lineup recorded Soundgarden&#x27;s third album in 1991. Cornell said that Shepherd brought a &quot;fresh and creative&quot; approach to the recording sessions, and the band as a whole said that his knowledge of music and writing skills redefined the band. The band released the resulting album, &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;, on October 8, 1991. Steve Huey of AllMusic said that the songwriting on &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; &quot;takes a quantum leap in focus and consistency&quot;. He added, &quot;It&#x27;s surprisingly cerebral and arty music for a band courting mainstream metal audiences.&quot; Thayil suggested that the album&#x27;s lyrics are &quot;like reading a novel [about] man&#x27;s conflict with himself and society, or the government, or his family, or the economy, or anything&quot;. The first single from &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;, &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot;, garnered attention when MTV decided to ban its music video in 1991. The song and its video outraged many listeners who perceived it as anti-Christian. The band received death threats while on tour in the United Kingdom in support of the album. Cornell explained that the lyrics criticize public figures who use religion (particularly the image of Jesus Christ) to portray themselves as being persecuted. Although eclipsed at the time of its release by the sudden popularity of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot;, the focus of attention brought by &quot;Nevermind&quot; to the Seattle scene helped Soundgarden gain wider attention. The singles &quot;Outshined&quot; and &quot;Rusty Cage&quot; were able to find an audience on alternative rock radio and MTV. &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1992, and was among the 100 top-selling albums of the year.

Following the release of &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;, Soundgarden went on a North American tour in October and November 1991. Afterward, Guns N&#x27; Roses personally selected the band as its opening act for their &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; tour. The band also opened for Skid Row in North America in February 1992 on their &quot;Slave to the Grind&quot; tour, and then headed to Europe for a month-long headlining theater tour. The band returned for a tour in the United States, and then rejoined Guns N&#x27; Roses in the summer of 1992 in Europe as part of the Use Your Illusion Tour along with fellow opening act Faith No More. Describing opening for Guns N&#x27; Roses, Cornell said, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a whole lot of fun going out in front of 40,000 people for 35 minutes every day. Most of them never heard our songs and didn&#x27;t care about them. It was a bizarre thing.&quot; The band played the 1992 Lollapalooza tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, Ministry and Ice Cube among others. In anticipation of the band&#x27;s appearance at Lollapalooza, they released a limited edition of &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; in 1992 with a second disc containing the EP &quot;Satanoscillatemymetallicsonatas&quot; (a palindrome), featuring Soundgarden&#x27;s cover of Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Into the Void&quot;, titled &quot;Into the Void (Sealth)&quot;, which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1993. The band later released the video compilation &quot;Motorvision&quot;, filmed at Seattle&#x27;s Paramount Theatre in 1992. The band appeared in the movie &quot;Singles&quot;, performing &quot;Birth Ritual&quot;. The song is included on , as is a Cornell solo song, &quot;Seasons&quot;.

In 1993, the band contributed the track &quot;Show Me&quot; to the AIDS-Benefit album &quot;No Alternative&quot;, produced by the Red Hot Organization.

===&quot;Superunknown&quot; and mainstream success (1994–1995)===
Soundgarden began working on its fourth album after touring in support of &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;. Cornell said that while working on the album, the band allowed each other more freedom than on past records, and Thayil observed that the band spent a lot more time working on the recording of the songs than on previous records. Released on March 8, 1994, &quot;Superunknown&quot; became the band&#x27;s breakthrough album, debuting at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart and being driven by the singles &quot;Spoonman&quot;, &quot;The Day I Tried to Live&quot;, &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;, &quot;My Wave&quot;, and &quot;Fell on Black Days&quot;.

The songs on &quot;Superunknown&quot; captured the creativity and heaviness of the band&#x27;s earlier works, while showcasing the group&#x27;s newly evolving style. Lyrically, the album was quite dark and mysterious, and it is often interpreted to be dealing with substance abuse, suicide, and depression. At the time, Sylvia Plath inspired Cornell&#x27;s writing. The album was also more experimental than previous releases, with some songs incorporating Middle-Eastern or Indian music. J. D. Considine of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said &quot;Superunknown&quot; &quot;demonstrates far greater range than many bands manage in an entire career&quot;. He also stated, &quot;At its best, &quot;Superunknown&quot; offers a more harrowing depiction of alienation and despair than anything on [Nirvana&#x27;s final studio album] &quot;In Utero&quot;.&quot; The music video for &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; became a hit on MTV, and received the award for Best Metal/Hard Rock Video at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards, and in 1995 the Clio Award for Alternative Music Video. Soundgarden won two Grammy Awards in 1995—&quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; received the award for Best Hard Rock Performance and &quot;Spoonman&quot; received the award for Best Metal Performance. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 1995. &quot;Superunknown&quot; has been certified six times Platinum in the United States and remains Soundgarden&#x27;s most successful album.

The band began touring in January 1994 in Oceania and Japan, areas where the record came out early and where the band had never toured before. This round of touring ended in February 1994. In March 1994 the band moved on to Europe. They began a theater tour of the United States, first with a stop on May 27, 1994, at the PNE Forum in Vancouver, with the opening acts Tad and Eleven. In late 1994, after touring in support of &quot;Superunknown&quot;, doctors discovered that Cornell had severely strained his vocal cords, and Soundgarden canceled several shows to avoid causing any permanent damage. Cornell said, &quot;I think we kinda overdid it! We were playing five or six nights a week and my voice pretty much took a beating. Towards the end of the American tour I felt like I could still kinda sing, but I wasn&#x27;t really giving the band a fair shake. You don&#x27;t buy a ticket to see some guy croak for two hours! That seemed like kind of a rip off.&quot; The band made up the dates later in 1995. &quot;Superunknown&quot; spawned the EP &quot;Songs from the Superunknown&quot; and the CD-ROM &quot;Alive in the Superunknown&quot;, both released in 1995.

===&quot;Down on the Upside&quot; and breakup (1996–1997)===
Following the worldwide tour in support of &quot;Superunknown&quot;, the band began working on what would become their last studio album for over 15 years, choosing to produce the record themselves. However, tensions within the group reportedly arose during the sessions, with Thayil and Cornell allegedly clashing over Cornell&#x27;s desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the band&#x27;s trademark. Cornell said, &quot;By the time we were finished, it felt like it had been kind of hard, like it was a long, hard haul. But there was stuff we were discovering.&quot; The band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Down on the Upside&quot;, was released on May 21, 1996. It was notably less heavy than the group&#x27;s earlier albums, and marked a further departure from the band&#x27;s grunge roots. At the time, Soundgarden explained that they wanted to experiment with other sounds, including acoustic instrumentation. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said, &quot;Few bands since Led Zeppelin have so crisply mixed instruments both acoustic and electric.&quot; The overall mood of the album&#x27;s lyrics is less dark than on previous Soundgarden albums, with Cornell describing some songs as &quot;self-affirming&quot;. The album spawned several singles, including &quot;Pretty Noose&quot;, &quot;Burden in My Hand&quot;, and &quot;Blow Up the Outside World&quot;. &quot;Pretty Noose&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1997. The album did not match the sales or critical praise of &quot;Superunknown&quot;.

The band took a slot on the 1996 Lollapalooza tour with Metallica, who had insisted on Soundgarden&#x27;s appearance on the tour. After Lollapalooza, the band embarked on a world tour, and already-existing tensions increased during it. When asked whether the band hated touring, Cornell replied: &quot;We really enjoy it to a point, and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That&#x27;s the point where we hate touring.&quot; At the tour&#x27;s last stop in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 9, 1997, Shepherd threw his bass into the air in frustration after suffering equipment failure, and then stormed off the stage. The band retreated, with Cornell returning to end the show with a solo encore. On April 9, 1997, the band announced it was disbanding. Thayil said, &quot;It was pretty obvious from everybody&#x27;s general attitude over the course of the previous half year that there was some dissatisfaction.&quot; Cameron later said that Soundgarden was &quot;eaten up by the business&quot;. The band released a greatest hits collection entitled &quot;A-Sides&quot; on November 4, 1997, composed of 17 songs, including the previously unreleased &quot;Bleed Together&quot;, which had been recorded during the &quot;Down on the Upside&quot; recording sessions.

===Post-breakup activities (1998–2009)===

Cornell released a solo album in September 1999, entitled &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot;, which featured Matt Cameron on the track &quot;Disappearing One&quot;. By May 2001, Cornell had joined the platinum-selling supergroup Audioslave with Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk, then-former members of Rage Against the Machine, which recorded three albums: &quot;Audioslave&quot; (2002), &quot;Out of Exile&quot; (2005), and &quot;Revelations&quot; (2006). Cornell left Audioslave in early 2007, resulting in the band&#x27;s break-up. His second solo album, &quot;Carry On&quot;, was released in June 2007, and his third solo album, &quot;Scream&quot;, produced by Timbaland, was released in March 2009, both to mixed commercial and critical success. Cornell also wrote the lyrics and provided vocals for the song &quot;Promise&quot; on Slash&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Slash&quot;, released in 2010.

Thayil joined forces with former Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra, former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic, and drummer Gina Mainwal for one show, performing as The No WTO Combo during the WTO ministerial conference in Seattle on December 1, 1999. Thayil contributed guitar tracks to Steve Fisk&#x27;s 2001 album, &quot;999 Levels of Undo&quot;, as well as Dave Grohl&#x27;s 2004 side-project album, &quot;Probot&quot;. In 2006, Thayil played guitar on the album &quot;Altar&quot;, the collaboration between the bands Sunn O))) and Boris.

Cameron initially turned his efforts to his side-project Wellwater Conspiracy, to which both Shepherd and Thayil have contributed. He then worked briefly with the Smashing Pumpkins on the band&#x27;s 1998 album, &quot;Adore&quot;. In 1998, he played drums for Pearl Jam&#x27;s Yield Tour following Jack Irons&#x27;s departure, and later joined Pearl Jam as an official member. He has recorded seven albums as the band&#x27;s drummer: &quot;Binaural&quot; (2000), &quot;Riot Act&quot; (2002), &quot;Pearl Jam&quot; (2006), &quot;Backspacer&quot; (2009), &quot;Lightning Bolt&quot; (2013), &quot;Gigaton&quot; (2020) and &quot;Dark Matter&quot; (2024). Cameron also played percussion on Geddy Lee&#x27;s album &quot;My Favourite Headache&quot;. In 2017, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pearl Jam.

Shepherd was the singer on Wellwater Conspiracy&#x27;s 1997 debut studio album, &quot;Declaration of Conformity&quot;, but left the band after its release. He has toured with Mark Lanegan and played bass on two of Lanegan&#x27;s albums, &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Care of You&quot; (1999), and &quot;Field Songs&quot; (2001). Shepherd and Cameron lent a hand with recording Tony Iommi&#x27;s album &quot;IOMMI&quot; (2000). While they were members of Soundgarden they were part of the side-project band Hater, and in 2005 Shepherd released the band&#x27;s long-delayed second album, &quot;The 2nd&quot;.

In a July 2009 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Cornell shot down rumors of a reunion, saying that conversations between the band members had been limited to discussion about the release of a box set or B-sides album of Soundgarden rarities, and that there had been no discussion of a reunion at all. The band&#x27;s interest in new releases emerged from a 2008 meeting about their shared properties, both financial and legal, where they realized Soundgarden lacked online presence such as a website or a Facebook page. As Thayil summed up, &quot;we kind of had neglected our merchandise over the last decade&quot;. Eventually the musicians decided to create an official site handled by Pearl Jam&#x27;s Ten Club, relaunch their catalog, and according to Cameron, seek &quot;a bunch of unreleased stuff we wanted to try to put out&quot;. In March 2009, Thayil, Shepherd and Cameron got onstage during a concert by Tad Doyle in Seattle and played some Soundgarden songs. Cornell stated that the moment &quot;sort of sparked the idea: If Matt, Kim, and Ben can get in a room, rehearse a couple songs, and play, maybe we all could do that as Soundgarden.&quot;

On October 6, 2009, all the members of Soundgarden attended Night 3 of Pearl Jam&#x27;s four-night stand at the Gibson Amphitheatre in Universal City, California. During an encore, Temple of the Dog reunited for the first time since Pearl Jam&#x27;s show at the Santa Barbara Bowl on October 28, 2003. Chris Cornell joined the band to sing &quot;Hunger Strike&quot;. It was the first public appearance of Soundgarden since their breakup in April 1997. Consequently, rumors of an impending reunion were circulating on the Internet.

===Reunion, &quot;Telephantasm&quot; and &quot;King Animal&quot; (2010–2013)===

On January 1, 2010, Cornell alluded to a Soundgarden reunion on his Twitter account writing: &quot;The 12-year break is over and school is back in session. Sign up now. Knights of the Soundtable ride again!&quot; The message linked to a website that featured a picture of the group performing live and a place for fans to enter their e-mail addresses to get updates on the reunion. Entering that information unlocked a video for the song &quot;Get on the Snake&quot;, from 1989&#x27;s &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;. On March 1, 2010, Soundgarden announced to their e-mail subscribers that they would be re-releasing an old single &quot;Hunted Down&quot; with the song &quot;Nothing to Say&quot; on a 7-inch vinyl record. It was released on April 17, Record Store Day. They released &quot;Spoonman&quot; live at the Del Mar Fairgrounds in San Diego, California from 1996. Soundgarden played their first show since 1997 on April 16 at the Showbox at the Market in the band&#x27;s hometown of Seattle. The band headlined Lollapalooza on August 8.

&quot;Telephantasm: A Retrospective&quot;, a new Soundgarden compilation album, was packaged with initial shipments of the &quot;Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock&quot; video game and released on September 28, 2010, one week before the CD&#x27;s availability in stores on October 5, 2010. An expanded version of &quot;Telephantasm&quot; consisting of two CDs and one DVD is available for sale. A previously unreleased Soundgarden song—&quot;Black Rain&quot;—debuted on the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; video game and appears on the compilation album, which achieved platinum certification status after its first day of retail availability. &quot;Black Rain&quot; hit rock radio stations on August 10, 2010, and was the band&#x27;s first single since 1997. In November 2010, Soundgarden was the second musical guest on the show &quot;Conan&quot;, making their first television appearance in 13 years. The band issued a 7-inch vinyl, &quot;The Telephantasm&quot;, for Black Friday Record Store Day. In March 2011, Soundgarden released their first live album, &quot;Live on I-5&quot;.

In February 2011 Soundgarden announced on their homepage that they had started recording a new album. On March 1, 2011, Chris Cornell confirmed that Adam Kasper would produce it. Four days later, the band stated it would consist of material that was &quot;90 percent new&quot; with the rest consisting of updated versions of older ideas. They also noted that they had 12 to 14 songs that were &quot;kind of ready to go&quot;. Although Cameron claimed the album would be released in 2011, the recording was prolonged as Thayil said that &quot;the more we enjoy it, the more our fans should end up enjoying it&quot;. Thayil also reported that some songs sound &quot;similar in a sense to &quot;Down on the Upside&quot;&quot; and that the album would be &quot;picking up where we left off. There are some heavy moments, and there are some fast songs.&quot; The next day, Cornell reported that the new album would not be released until the spring of 2012.
In April 2011, Soundgarden announced a summer tour consisting of 16 dates across the US with various opening acts. The band later headlined Voodoo Experience at City Park in New Orleans on the 2011 Halloween weekend. In March 2012 a post on the band&#x27;s official Facebook page said a new song, &quot;Live to Rise&quot;, would be included on the soundtrack of the upcoming movie &quot;The Avengers&quot;, based on the Marvel Comics franchise. It was the first newly recorded song the band had released since re-forming in 2010. &quot;Live to Rise&quot; was released as a free download on iTunes on April 17. Also in March it was announced that Soundgarden would headline the Friday night of the Hard Rock Calling Festival the following July in London, England. In April, Soundgarden announced the release of a box set titled &quot;Classic Album Selection&quot; for Europe, containing all of their studio albums except for &quot;Ultramega OK&quot;, and live album &quot;Live on I-5&quot;. On May 5, just before The Offspring began playing their set, the band appeared as a special guest at the 20th annual KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California. Later that month, Soundgarden told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; they were eyeing an October release for their new album. That June, the band appeared at Download Festival in Donington, England. The band released &quot;Been Away Too Long&quot;, the first single from their new album &quot;King Animal&quot; on September 27; the album was released on November 13, 2012. The band released a video for &quot;By Crooked Steps&quot;, directed by Dave Grohl, in early 2013. &quot;Halfway There&quot; was the third single released from the album.

===&quot;Echo of Miles...&quot; and Cornell&#x27;s death (2013–2017)===

On November 15, 2013, drummer Matt Cameron announced he would not be touring with Soundgarden in 2014, due to prior commitments promoting Pearl Jam&#x27;s album &quot;Lightning Bolt&quot;. On March 16, 2014, Soundgarden and Nine Inch Nails announced they were going to tour North America together, along with opening act Death Grips. Former Pearl Jam drummer Matt Chamberlain replaced Cameron for live shows in South America and Europe on March 27, 2014.

Soundgarden announced on October 28, 2014, they would release the 3-CD compilation box set, &quot;Echo of Miles: Scattered Tracks Across the Path&quot;, on November 24. The set includes rarities, live tracks, and unreleased material spanning the group&#x27;s history. It includes previously released songs, such as &quot;Live to Rise&quot;, &quot;Black Rain&quot;, &quot;Birth Ritual&quot;, and others, as well as a newly recorded rendition of the song &quot;The Storm&quot; from the band&#x27;s pre-Matt Cameron 1985 demo, now simply titled &quot;Storm&quot;, which was, like the original, produced by Jack Endino. One day before its official announcement, on October 27, the band posted a copy of &quot;Storm&quot; on YouTube.

Thayil mentioned in several interviews it was likely the band would start working on material for a new album in 2015, and in August 2015, Cornell stated they were doing so. On January 19, 2016, The Pulse Of Radio announced that Soundgarden had returned to the studio to continue working on their new album. On July 14, 2016, bassist Ben Shepherd and Cameron stated that the band had written &quot;six solid tunes&quot; for the new album, with more writing to be done in August.

On May 18, 2017, Cornell was found dead, &quot;with a band around his neck&quot;, according to his representative, Brian Bumbery. Cornell was in his room at the MGM Grand hotel and casino in Detroit, Michigan, after performing at the Fox Theatre with Soundgarden. From the outset, the investigation into the singer&#x27;s death was described by a local police spokesperson as that of a &quot;possible suicide&quot;, based on unspecified details in the room where his body was discovered. Subsequently, the Wayne County Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office determined the cause of death as suicide by hanging. However, Cornell&#x27;s widow, Vicky, questioned whether he would deliberately end his own life, and said that the drug Ativan, which her husband was taking, might have led him to commit suicide. She said: &quot;I know that he loved our children and he would not hurt them by intentionally taking his own life.&quot;

Following Cornell&#x27;s death, Soundgarden canceled the rest of their 2017 tour, including headlining performances at Rock on the Range and Rocklahoma later that month.

===Aftermath, disbandment and reunions (2017–present)===
In September 2017, drummer Matt Cameron told &quot;Billboard&quot; that he and the other surviving members of Soundgarden had yet to make a decision about the future of the band following Cornell&#x27;s death. He was quoted as saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re ready to say anything other than ... Kim and Ben and I are certainly aware of how much our fans are hurting, and we&#x27;re certainly hurting right there along with them. But we&#x27;re extremely private people, and we&#x27;re all still processing our grief in our own way and on our own time. But we definitely are thinking of our fans and love them very much.&quot;

In September 2018, guitarist Kim Thayil told &quot;Billboard&quot; that he and the other surviving members of Soundgarden were still unsure about the future of the band. He was quoted as saying, &quot;We often reference rock history and we&#x27;ve often commented on what other bands in similar situations have done, not as a plan or anything but just commenting on how bands have handled situations like this and what bands seem to have been graceful and dignified in how they manage their future musical endeavors and how some maybe were clumsy and callous. We think about those things. We try not to go too deep into these conversations, but stuff comes up after a few beers.&quot; A month later, Cameron told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that the surviving members of Soundgarden &quot;would certainly love to try to continue to do something, figure out something to do together.&quot; Bassist Ben Shepherd added, &quot;We haven&#x27;t even gotten a chance to hang out, just us three, yet. We&#x27;re going through natural healing, then thinking about the natural next step.&quot;

In an October 2018 interview with &quot;Seattle Times&quot;, Thayil stated that the Soundgarden band name would be retired. He explained, &quot;I don&#x27;t know really what kind of thing is possible or what we would consider in the future. It&#x27;s likely nothing. The four of us were that. There were four of us and now there&#x27;s three of us, so it&#x27;s just not likely that there&#x27;s much to be pursued other than the catalog work at this point.&quot; Thayil also stated that while he does not rule out the possibility of working with Cameron and Shepherd in a different capacity, writing or touring under the Soundgarden banner again was unlikely. &quot;No, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s anything we&#x27;d give reasonable consideration to at this point. When I say &#x27;at this point,&#x27; I mean perhaps ever.&quot;

In January 2019, the remaining members of the band reunited in a tribute concert and fundraiser at The Forum in Inglewood, California, organized by Cornell&#x27;s widow, Vicky Cornell. Members of Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog, Audioslave, Alice in Chains, Melvins, Foo Fighters, and Metallica together with other notable artists performed songs from Cornell&#x27;s career. Taylor Momsen, Marcus Durant, Brandi Carlile, and Taylor Hawkins contributed vocals to Soundgarden, who performed &quot;Rusty Cage&quot;, &quot;Flower&quot;, &quot;Outshined&quot;, &quot;Drawing Flies&quot;, &quot;Loud Love&quot;, &quot;I Awake&quot;, &quot;The Day I Tried to Live&quot;, and &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;, making this their only performance since Cornell&#x27;s death.

In July 2019, Thayil said in an interview with &quot;Music Radar&quot; that the surviving members of Soundgarden are trying to finish and release the album they were working on with Cornell. However, the master files of Cornell&#x27;s vocal recordings are currently being withheld, and when Thayil sought permission to use these files, he was denied.

In December 2019, Cornell&#x27;s widow, Vicky Cornell, sued the surviving members of Soundgarden over seven unreleased recordings Cornell made before his death in 2017, claiming &quot;they have “shamelessly conspired to wrongfully withhold hundreds of thousands of dollars indisputably owed to Chris’ widow and minor children in an unlawful attempt to strong-arm Chris’ Estate into turning over certain audio recordings created by Chris before he passed away.&quot; The lawsuit stated that Cornell made the seven recordings at his personal studio in Florida in 2017, which there was never any explicit agreement that these songs were meant for Soundgarden, and that Cornell was the only owner of tracks. In February 2020, Thayil, Cameron and Shepherd demanded Vicky to hand over the unreleased recordings, claiming that they worked jointly on these final tracks with Chris and that Vicky has no right to withhold from them what they call the &quot;final Soundgarden album.&quot; The band members pointed to interviews Chris and his bandmates made at the time confirming they were working together on what would be Soundgarden&#x27;s eighth album. In March 2020, Soundgarden asked court to dismiss the lawsuit. In May 2020, Soundgarden countersued Vicky claiming that she engaged in &quot;fraudulent inducement&quot; by allegedly attempting to use the revenue from the January 2019 &quot;I Am the Highway: A Tribute to Chris Cornell&quot; concert, which was meant to go to the Chris and Vicky Cornell Foundation, for &quot;personal purposes for herself and her family&quot;. The band dropped the benefit concert lawsuit in July 2020.

On August 10, 2020, Nile Rodgers and Merck Mercuriadis&#x27;s company Hipgnosis Songs Fund acquired 100% of Chris Cornell&#x27;s catalog of song rights (241 songs), including Soundgarden&#x27;s catalog. Rodgers is friends with Cornell&#x27;s widow.

On December 1, 2020, Thayil, Shepherd and Cameron performed as &quot;members of Soundgarden&quot; alongside Tad Doyle, Mike McCready and Meagan Grandallat at MoPOP Founders Award tribute to Alice in Chains.

In February 2021, Vicky Cornell filed another lawsuit claiming that the remaining members of Soundgarden have undervalued her share of the band, offering her “the villainously low figure of less than $300,000.” Vicky claimed the band offered her $300,000 despite receiving a $16 million offer from another investor for the act&#x27;s master recordings. Vicky said she counter-offered $12 million for the band&#x27;s collective interests, equaling $4 million per surviving member, which they denied. She then offered them $21 million for the band&#x27;s interests, and that offer was also rejected. Soundgarden said in a statement that the &quot;buyout offer that was demanded by the estate has been grossly mischaracterized and we are confident that clarity will come out in court. All offers to buy out our interests have been unsolicited and rejected outright.&quot; The band also noted that they also haven&#x27;t had access to their social media accounts, which has resulted in &quot;misleading and confusing our fans&quot;, leading the band to create new Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts under the name &quot;Nude Dragons&quot;, an anagram for Soundgarden. On March 19, 2021, a federal judge recommended that claims the surviving band members improperly withheld &quot;hundreds of thousands of dollars&quot; and that the band&#x27;s manager breached his duty to look after Vicky&#x27;s interests be dismissed, citing lack of evidence of the band withholding royalties. On March 25, 2021, Soundgarden demanded the passwords for their social media and website. On June 15, 2021, the band got their website and social media accounts back in a temporary agreement with Vicky.

On April 17, 2023, it was officially revealed that seven final recordings with Cornell would be released after the dispute between the members and Vicky Cornell had ended.

On December 14, 2024, the surviving members of Soundgarden, along with vocalist Shaina Shepherd, performed together under the moniker Nudedragons (previously used in 2010) for a benefit show in Seattle for the Seattle Children&#x27;s Hospital.

==Musical style and influences==
Soundgarden were pioneers of the grunge music genre, which mixed elements of punk rock and metal to make a sludgy, murky sound through the use of fuzzy-sounding distortion in the guitars.

Soundgarden cited Minutemen, the Meat Puppets, Butthole Surfers, Wire, and Joy Division as key early influences. Black Sabbath also had a significant impact on the band&#x27;s sound, especially on the guitar riffs and tunings. Kim Thayil has described the band&#x27;s sound as a &quot;Sabbath-influenced punk&quot;.

Soundgarden has been frequently compared to Led Zeppelin, their early sound being described as consisting of &quot;gnarled neo-Zeppelinisms&quot;. Though the band initially denied being inspired by Led Zeppelin, they would eventually embrace this influence, as detailed by guitarist Kim Thayil:[W]e started getting [comparisons to Led Zeppelin] a lot: &#x27;Zeppelin, Zeppelin, Zeppelin,&#x27; and we were like, OK, let&#x27;s check some of this out. We were all very acquainted with it individually, but collectively we weren&#x27;t sitting around the table listening them. So initially we would deny that influence. Eventually, after practice we&#x27;d be like, &#x27;Let’s check out &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;.&#x27; Let’s listen to &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot;.&#x27; Like, &#x27;Yeah, I guess I can kind of see that a little bit.&#x27; It became very important to us, because of the comparison, so we would listen to it and start referencing it. Ultimately, we started to re-embrace the Zeppelin, Beatles, Sabbath and Pink Floyd. I think they were always there. At some point, we had to look back and say, &#x27;This has a lot to do with our upbringing.&#x27; It&#x27;s a weird story, but it may explain why, for a few years, we denied the Zeppelin-Sabbath influence.

Though the influence of Led Zeppelin was evident, &quot;Q&quot; magazine noted that Soundgarden were &quot;in thrall to &#x27;70s rock, but contemptuous of the genre&#x27;s overt sexism and machismo.&quot;

The Butthole Surfers&#x27; mix of punk, heavy metal and noise rock was a major influence on the early work of Soundgarden. Soundgarden, like other early grunge bands, were also influenced by British post-punk bands such as Gang of Four and Bauhaus which were popular in the early 1980s Seattle scene. The band was also influenced by the likes of the Ramones, Kiss, Accept, the Melvins, and Saint Vitus.

The name of the band, according to Thayil, was supposed to include the many roots of their style: that included &quot;a virtual plethora of cutting edge rock that spans Velvet Underground, Meat Puppets, and Killing Joke&quot;. The band also mentioned &quot;Metallica Gothicism and sublime poetry. The almost ethereal flavour of the name betrays the brutality of the music but never pins Soundgarden in one corner&quot;.

Cornell himself said: &quot;When Soundgarden formed we were post-punk – pretty quirky. Then somehow we found this neo-Sabbath psychedelic rock that fitted well with who we were.&quot;

Soundgarden broadened its musical range with its later releases. By 1994&#x27;s &quot;Superunknown&quot;, the band began to incorporate more psychedelic influences into its music. Cornell also became known for his wide vocal range and his dark, existentialist lyrics.

Soundgarden also used unorthodox time signatures; &quot;Fell on Black Days&quot; is in 6/4, &quot;Limo Wreck&quot; is played in 15/8, and &quot;The Day I Tried to Live&quot; alternates between 7/8 and 4/4 sections. The main guitar riff of &quot;Circle of Power&quot; is in 5/4. The E strings of the instruments were at times tuned even lower, such as on &quot;Rusty Cage&quot;, where the lower E is tuned down to B. Some songs use more unorthodox tunings: &quot;Been Away Too Long&quot;, &quot;My Wave&quot;, and &quot;The Day I Tried to Live&quot; are all in a E–E–B–B–B–B tuning and &quot;Burden in My Hand&quot;, &quot;Head Down&quot;, and &quot;Pretty Noose&quot; in a tuning of C-G-C-G-G-E&quot;. Thayil has said Soundgarden usually did not consider the time signature of a song until after the band wrote it, and said the use of odd meters was &quot;a total accident&quot;. He also used the meters as an example of the band&#x27;s anti-commercial stance, saying that if Soundgarden &quot;were in the business of hit singles, we&#x27;d at least write songs in 4/4 so you could dance to them&quot;.

==Legacy==
The development of the Seattle independent record label Sub Pop Records is tied closely to Soundgarden (due to Sub Pop co-founder Jonathan Poneman funding Soundgarden&#x27;s early releases), and the success of the band resulted in the expansion of Sub Pop as a serious record label.

Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was a fan of Soundgarden&#x27;s music, and reportedly Soundgarden&#x27;s involvement with Sub Pop influenced Cobain to sign Nirvana with the label. Cobain also stated that Soundgarden was one of the only Seattle bands that he liked along with Tad and Mudhoney. In rare footage from the 2015 documentary &quot;Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck&quot;, Cobain can be seen impersonating Chris Cornell singing &quot;Outshined&quot;. Alice in Chains guitarist and vocalist, Jerry Cantrell stated that Soundgarden was a big influence on his band.

Soundgarden was the first grunge band to sign to a major label when the band joined the roster of A&amp;M Records in 1989. However, Soundgarden did not achieve success initially, and only with successive album releases did the band meet with increased sales and wider attention. Bassist Ben Shepherd has not been receptive to the grunge label, saying in a 2013 interview &quot;That&#x27;s just marketing. It&#x27;s called rock and roll, or it&#x27;s called punk rock or whatever. We never were Grunge, we were just a band from Seattle.&quot; They were ranked No. 14 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.

In 1994, Electronic Arts contacted Soundgarden&#x27;s label A&amp;M Records for a bid to license the band&#x27;s music for a CD-based entry in the &quot;Road Rash&quot; video game series. Although the label was initially hesitant due to the lack of precedence for licensing music for video games, Cornell and his band members expressed enthusiasm, as they were fans of the games and frequently played them on their bus while touring the country. A&amp;M then obtained the band&#x27;s permission to use them as leverage to incorporate other alt-rock bands within the A&amp;M label into the game, including Monster Magnet, Paw, Swervedriver, Therapy? and Hammerbox. As a result of Soundgarden&#x27;s involvement, the 3DO version of &quot;Road Rash&quot; has been credited with revolutionizing the use of licensed music in video games.

Regarding Soundgarden&#x27;s legacy, in a 2007 interview Cornell said:

I think, and this is now with some distance in listening to the records, but on the outside looking in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I&#x27;m really proud of it. And I guess that&#x27;s why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don&#x27;t know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn&#x27;t want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.

Soundgarden has been praised for its technical musical ability, and the expansion of its sound as the band&#x27;s career progressed. &quot;Heavy yet ethereal, powerful yet always-in-control, Soundgarden&#x27;s music was a study in contrasts,&quot; said Henry Wilson of &quot;Hit Parader&quot;. Wilson proclaimed the band&#x27;s music as &quot;a brilliant display of technical proficiency tempered by heart-felt emotion&quot;.

Soundgarden is one of the bands credited with the development of the alternative metal genre, with AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine stating that &quot;Soundgarden made a place for heavy metal in alternative rock.&quot; Ben Ratliff of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; defined Soundgarden as the &quot;standard-bearers&quot; of the rock riff during the 1990s.

Several bands from different genres have cited Soundgarden as an influence, including Biffy Clyro, Stabbing Westward, the Dillinger Escape Plan, Cave In, and Iceburn.

In 2017, &quot;Metal Injection&quot; ranked Soundgarden at number three on their list of 10 Heaviest Grunge Bands. Loudwire recognizes Soundgarden as one of the &quot;big four&quot; bands of grunge, alongside Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Nirvana.

===Early life===

Theodore Beza was born on 24 June 1519 in Vézelay, in the province of Burgundy, France. His father, Pierre de Bèze, bailiff of Vézelay, descended from a Burgundian noble family; his mother, Marie Bourdelot, was known for her generosity. Beza&#x27;s father had two brothers; Nicolas, who was member of the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris, and Claude, who was abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Froimont in the diocese of Beauvais. Nicolas, who was unmarried, during a visit to Vézelay was so pleased with Theodore that, with the permission of his parents, he took him to Paris to educate him there. 

From Paris, Theodore was sent to Orléans in December 1528 to receive instruction from the famous German humanist . He was received into Wolmar&#x27;s house, and the day on which this took place was afterward celebrated as a second birthday. Beza soon followed his teacher to Bourges, where the latter was called by Duchess Margaret of Angoulême, sister of King Francis I. At the time, Bourges was the focus of the Reformation movement in France. In 1534, after Francis I issued his edict against ecclesiastical innovations, Wolmar returned to Germany. Beza, in accordance with the wish of his father, went back to Orléans and studied law from 1535 to 1539. The pursuit of law had little attraction for him; he enjoyed more the reading of the ancient classics, especially Ovid, Catullus, and Tibullus.

He received a licentiate in law 11 August 1539, and, as his father desired, went to Paris, where he began to practice. To support him, his relatives had obtained for him two benefices, the proceeds of which amounted to 700 golden crowns a year; and his uncle had promised to make him his successor. Beza spent two years in Paris and gained a prominent position in literary circles. To escape the many temptations to which he was exposed, with the knowledge of two friends, he became engaged in the year 1544 to a young girl of humble descent, Claudine Denosse, promising to publicly marry her as soon as his circumstances would allow it.

In 1548, Beza published a collection of Latin poetry, &quot;Juvenilia&quot;, which made him famous, and he was considered one of the best writers of Latin poetry of his time. But his work attracted unexpected criticism; as Philip Schaff says, &quot;Prurient minds...read between his lines what he never intended to put there, and imagined offences of which he was not guilty even in thought&quot;. Shortly after the publication of his book, Beza fell ill with plague and his illness, it is reported, revealed to him his spiritual needs. Following his recovery, Beza adhered to the Reformed faith, a decision which resulted in a condemnation from the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris, the loss of part of his property and the need to leave France. He then resolved to sever his connections of the time, and went to the Republic of Geneva, a place of refuge for adherents of the Reformation, where he arrived with Claudine on 23 October 1548.

===Teacher at Lausanne===
Theodore Beza was received in Geneva by John Calvin, who had met him already in Wolmar&#x27;s house, and was at once married to Claudine. Beza was at a loss for immediate occupation so he went to Tübingen to see his former teacher Wolmar. On his way home, he visited Pierre Viret at Lausanne, who brought about his appointment as professor of Greek at the Academy of Lausanne in November 1549. Beza served as rector of the academy from 1552 to 1554.

Beza found time to write a Biblical drama, &quot;Abraham Sacrifiant&quot;, in which he contrasted Catholicism with Protestantism, and the work was well received. The text of some verses includes directions for musical performance, but no music survives.

In 1551, Beza was asked by Calvin to complete the French metrical translations of the Psalms begun by Clément Marot. Thirty-four of his translations were published in the 1551 edition of the Genevan Psalter, and six more were added to later editions. About the same time he published &quot;Passavantius&quot;, a satire directed against Pierre Lizet, the former president of the Parlement of Paris, and principal originator of the &quot;fiery chamber&quot; (&quot;chambre ardente&quot;), who, at the time (1551), was abbot of St. Victor near Paris and publishing a number of polemical writings.

Of a more serious character were two controversies in which Beza was involved at this time. The first concerned the doctrine of predestination and the controversy of Calvin with Jerome Hermes Bolsec. The second referred to the execution of Michael Servetus at Geneva on 27 October 1553. In defense of Calvin and the Genevan magistrates, Beza published, in 1554, the work &quot;De haereticis a civili magistratu puniendis&quot; (translated into French in 1560).

===Journeys on behalf of the Protestants===

In 1557, Beza took a special interest in the Waldensians of Piedmont, Italy, who were being harassed by the French government. On their behalf, he went with William Farel to Bern, Zürich, Basel, and Schaffhausen, then to Strasburg, Mömpelgard, Baden, and Göppingen. In Baden and Göppingen, Beza and Farel made a declaration concerning the Waldensians&#x27; views on the sacrament on 14 May 14 1557. The written declaration clearly stated their position and was well received by the Lutheran theologians, but was strongly disapproved of in Bern and Zurich.

In the autumn of 1558, Beza undertook a second journey with Farel to Worms by way of Strasburg in the hopes of bringing about an intercession by the Evangelical princes of the empire in favor of the persecuted brethren at Paris. 
With Melanchthon and other theologians then assembled at the Colloquy of Worms, Beza proposed a union of all Protestant Christians, but the proposal was decidedly denied by Zurich and Bern.

False reports reached the German princes that the hostilities against the Huguenots in France had ceased and no embassy was sent to the court of France. 
As a result, Beza undertook another journey with Farel, Johannes Buddaeus, and Gaspard Carmel to Strasburg and Frankfurt, where the sending of an embassy to Paris was resolved upon.

===Settling in Geneva===
Upon his return to Lausanne, Beza was greatly disturbed. In union with many ministers and professors in city and country, Viret at last thought of establishing a consistory and of introducing a church discipline which should apply excommunication especially at the celebration of the communion. But the Bernese, then in control of Lausanne, would have no Calvinistic church government. This caused many difficulties, and Beza thought it best in 1558, to settle at Geneva. Here he was given chair of Greek in the newly established academy, and after Calvin&#x27;s death also that of theology. He was also obliged to preach.

He completed the revision of Pierre Olivetan&#x27;s translation of the New Testament, begun some years before. In 1559, he undertook another journey in the interest of the Huguenots, this time to Heidelberg. At about the same time, he had to defend Calvin against Joachim Westphal in Hamburg and Tilemann Heshusius.

More important than this polemical activity was Beza&#x27;s statement of his own confession. It was originally prepared for his father in justification of his actions and published in revised form to promote Evangelical knowledge among Beza&#x27;s countrymen. It was printed in Latin in 1560 with a dedication to Wolmar. An English translation was published at London 1563, 1572, and 1585. Translations into German, Dutch, and Italian were also issued.

===Events of 1560–63===
In the meantime, things took such shape in France that the happiest future for Protestantism seemed possible. King Antoine of Navarre, yielding to the urgent requests of Evangelical noblemen, declared his willingness to listen to a prominent teacher of the Church. Beza, a French nobleman and head of the academy in the metropolis of French Protestantism, was invited to Castle Nerac, but he could not plant the seed of Evangelical faith in the heart of the king.

In the following year, 1561, Beza represented the Evangelicals at the Colloquy of Poissy, and in an eloquent manner defended the principles of the Evangelical faith. The colloquy was without result, but Beza as the head and advocate of all Reformed congregations of France was revered and hated at the same time. The queen insisted upon another colloquy, which was opened at St. Germain 28 January 1562, eleven days after the proclamation of the famous January edict, which granted important privileges to those of the Reformed faith. But the colloquy was broken off when it became evident that the Catholic party was preparing (after the Massacre of Vassy, on March 1) to overthrow Protestantism.

Beza hastily issued a circular letter (March 25) to all Reformed congregations of the empire, and went to Orléans with the Huguenot leader Conde and his troops. It was necessary to proceed quickly and energetically. But there were neither soldiers nor money. At the request of Conde, Beza visited all Huguenot cities to obtain both. He also wrote a manifesto in which he argued the justice of the Reformed cause. As one of the messengers to collect soldiers and money among his coreligionists, Beza was appointed to visit England, Germany, and Switzerland. He went to Strasburg and Basel, but met with failure. He then returned to Geneva, which he reached September 4. He had hardly been there fourteen days when he was called once more to Orléans by D&#x27;Andelot. The campaign was becoming more successful; but the publication of the unfortunate edict of pacification which Conde accepted (Mar. 12,1563) filled Beza and all Protestant France with horror.

===Calvin&#x27;s successor===

For 22 months Beza had been absent from Geneva, and the interests of school and Church there and especially the condition of Calvin made it necessary for him to return, as there was no one to take the place of Calvin, who was sick and unable to work. Calvin and Beza arranged to perform their duties jointly in alternate weeks, but the death of Calvin occurred soon afterward (27 May 1564). As a matter of course Beza was his successor.

Until 1580, Beza was not only moderator of the Company of Pastors, but also the real soul of the Academy of Geneva which Calvin had founded in 1559. As long as he lived, Beza was interested in higher education. The Protestant youth for nearly forty years thronged his lecture-room to hear his theological lectures, in which he expounded the purest Calvinistic orthodoxy. As a counselor he was listened to by both magistrates and pastors. He founded the Academy&#x27;s law faculty in which notable jurists such as François Hotman, Giulio Pace, Lambert Daneau, and Denis Godefroy, lectured in turn.

===Course of events after 1564===

As Calvin&#x27;s successor, Beza was very successful, not only in carrying on his work but also in giving peace to the Church at Geneva. The magistrates had fully appropriated the ideas of Calvin, and the direction of spiritual affairs, the organs of which were the &quot;ministers of the word&quot; and &quot;the consistory&quot;, was founded on a solid basis. No doctrinal controversy arose after 1564. The discussions concerned questions of a practical, social, or ecclesiastical nature, such as the supremacy of the magistrates over the pastors, freedom in preaching, and the obligation of the pastors to submit to the majority of the Company of Pastors.

Beza did not force his will upon his associates, and took no harsh measures against injudicious or hot-headed colleagues, though sometimes he took their cases in hand and acted as mediator; and yet he often experienced an opposition so extreme that he threatened to resign. Although he was inclined to take the part of the magistrates, he knew how to defend the rights and independence of the spiritual power when occasion arose, without, however, conceding to it such a preponderating influence as did Calvin.

Beza did not believe it wise for the Company of Pastors to have a permanent head. He convinced the Company to petition the Small Council to have limited terms for the position of moderator. In 1580 the Council agreed to a weekly rotating presidency. He mediated between the &quot;compagnie&quot; and the magistracy; the latter continually asked his advice even in political questions. He corresponded with all the leaders of the Reformed party in Europe. After the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre (1572), he used his influence to give to the refugees a hospitable reception at Geneva.

In 1574, he wrote his &quot;De jure magistratuum&quot; (Right of Magistrates), in which he emphatically protested against tyranny in religious matters, and affirmed that it is legitimate for a people to oppose an unworthy magistracy in a practical manner and if necessary to use weapons and depose them.

Without being a great dogmatician like his master, nor a creative genius in the ecclesiastical realm, Beza had qualities which made him famous as humanist, exegete, orator, and leader in religious and political affairs, and qualified him to be the guide of the Calvinists in all Europe. In the various controversies into which he was drawn, Beza often showed an excess of irritation and intolerance, from which Bernardino Ochino, pastor of the Italian congregation at Zurich (on account of a treatise which contained some objectionable points on polygamy), and Sebastian Castellio at Basel (on account of his Latin and French translations of the Bible) had especially to suffer.

Beza continued to maintain the closest relations with Reformed France. He was the moderator of the general synod which met in April 1571 at La Rochelle and decided not to abolish church discipline or to acknowledge the civil government as head of the Church, as the Paris minister Jean Morel and the philosopher Pierre Ramus demanded; it also decided to confirm anew the Calvinistic doctrine of the Lord&#x27;s Supper (by the expression: &quot;substance of the body of Christ&quot;) against Zwinglianism, which caused a dispute between Beza and Ramus and Heinrich Bullinger.

In May 1572 he took an important part in the national synod at Nîmes. He was also interested in the controversies which concerned the Augsburg Confession in Germany, especially after 1564, on the doctrine of the Person of Christ and the sacrament, and published several works against Joachim Westphal, Tilemann Heshusius, Nikolaus Selnecker, Johannes Brenz, and Jakob Andrea. This caused him to be hated by all those who adhered to Lutheranism in opposition to Melanchthon, especially after 1571.

===The Colloquy of Montbéliard===
The last polemical conflict of importance Beza encountered from the Lutherans was at the Colloquy of Montbéliard, 14–27 March 1586, (which is also called the Mompelgard Colloquium) to which he had been invited by the Lutheran Count Frederick of Württemberg at the wish of the French-speaking and Reformed residents as well as by French noblemen who had fled to Montbéliard. As a matter of course the intended union which was the purpose of the colloquy was not brought about; nevertheless it called forth serious developments within the Reformed Church.

When the edition of the acts of the colloquy, as prepared by Jakob Andrea, was published, Samuel Huber, of Burg near Bern, who belonged to the Lutheranizing faction of the Swiss clergy, took so great offense at the supralapsarian doctrine of predestination propounded at Montbéliard by Beza and Musculus that he felt it to be his duty to denounce Musculus to the magistrates of Bern as an innovator in doctrine. To adjust the matter, the magistrates arranged a colloquy between Huber and Musculus (2 September 1587), in which the former represented the universalism, the latter the particularism, of grace.

As the colloquy was resultless, a debate was arranged at Bern, 15–18 April 1588, at which the defense of the accepted system of doctrine was at the start put into Beza&#x27;s hands. The three delegates of the Helvetic cantons who presided at the debate declared in the end that Beza had substantiated the teaching propounded at Montbéliard as the orthodox one, and Huber was dismissed from his office.

===Later years===

After that time Beza&#x27;s activity was confined more and more to the affairs of his home. His wife Claudine had died childless in 1588 after forty years of marriage, a few days before he went to the Bern Disputation. He contracted, on the advice of his friends, a second marriage with the widow Caterina del Piano, a Protestant refugee from Asti, Piedmont, in order to have a helpmate in his declining years. Up to his sixty-fifth year he enjoyed excellent health, but after that a gradual sinking of his vitality became perceptible. He was active in teaching until January 1597.

The saddest experience in his old days was the conversion of King Henry IV to Catholicism, in spite of his most earnest exhortations (1593). In 1596, a false report was spread by the Jesuits in Germany, France, England, and Italy that Beza and the Church of Geneva had returned into the bosom of Rome, and Beza replied in a satire which showed that he still possessed his old fire of thought and vigor of expression.

Beza died on 13 October 1605 in Geneva. He was not buried, like Calvin, in the general cemetery at Plainpalais (for the Savoyards had threatened to abduct his body to Rome), but at the direction of the magistrates, at Saint-Pierre Cathedral.

==Literary works==

===Humanistic and historical writings===
In Beza&#x27;s literary activity as well as in his life, distinction must be made between the period of the humanist (which ended with the publication of his &quot;Juvenilia&quot;) and that of the ecclesiastic. Combining his pastoral and literary gifts, Beza wrote the first drama produced in French, &quot;Abraham Sacrifiant&quot;; a play that is an antecedent to the work of Racine and is still occasionally produced today. Later productions like the humanistic, biting, satirical &quot;Passavantius&quot; and his &quot;Complainte de Messire Pierre Lizet...&quot; prove that in later years he occasionally went back to his first love. In his old age he published his &quot;Cato censorius&quot; (1591), and revised his &quot;Poemata&quot;, from which he purged juvenile eccentricities.

Of his historiographical works, aside from his &quot;Icones&quot; (1580), which have only an iconographical value, mention may be made of the famous &quot;Histoire ecclesiastique des Eglises reformes au Royaume de France&quot; (1580), and his biography of Calvin, with which must be named his edition of Calvin&#x27;s &quot;Epistolae et responsa&quot; (1575).

===Theological works===
But all these humanistic and historical studies are surpassed by his theological productions (contained in &quot;Tractationes theologicae&quot;). In these Beza appears the perfect pupil or the &quot;alter ego&quot; of Calvin. His view of life is deterministic and the basis of his religious thinking is the predestinate recognition of the necessity of all temporal existence as an effect of the absolute, eternal, and immutable will of God, so that even the fall of the human race appears to him essential to the divine plan of the world. Beza, in tabular form, thoroughly elucidates the religious views which emanated from a fundamental supralapsarian mode of thought. This he added to his highly instructive treatise &quot;Summa totius Christianismi.&quot;

Beza&#x27;s &quot;De vera excommunicatione et Christiano presbyterio&quot; (1590), written as a response to Thomas Erastus&#x27;s &quot;Explicatio gravissimae quaestionis utrum excommunicatio&quot; (1589) contributed an important defense of the right of ecclesiastical authorities (rather than civil authorities) to excommunicate.

===Beza&#x27;s Greek New Testament===
Of no less importance are the contributions of Beza to Biblical scholarship. In 1565 he issued an edition of the Greek New Testament, accompanied in parallel columns by the text of the Vulgate and a translation of his own (already published as early as 1556, though our earliest extant edition dates to 1559). Annotations were added, also previously published, but now he greatly enriched and enlarged them.

In the preparation of this edition of the Greek text, but much more in the preparation of the second edition which he brought out in 1582, Beza may have availed himself of the help of two very valuable manuscripts. One is known as the &quot;Codex Bezae&quot; or &quot;Cantabrigensis,&quot; and was later presented by Beza to the University of Cambridge, where it remains in the Cambridge University Library; the second is the &quot;Codex Claromontanus&quot;, which Beza had found in Clermont (now in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France in Paris).

It was not, however, to these sources that Beza was chiefly indebted, but rather to the previous edition of the eminent Robert Estienne (1550), itself based in great measure upon one of the later editions of Erasmus. Beza&#x27;s labours in this direction were exceedingly helpful to those who came after. The same thing may be asserted with equal truth of his Latin version and of the copious notes with which it was accompanied. The former is said to have been published over a hundred times.

Although some contend that Beza&#x27;s view of the doctrine of predestination exercised an overly dominant influence upon his interpretation of the Scriptures, there is no question that he added much to a clear understanding of the New Testament.

<doc id="40323" wikidata="Q1364409" url="?curid=40323" title="Inertial confinement fusion">
<text>Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) is a fusion energy process that initiates nuclear fusion reactions by compressing and heating targets filled with fuel. The targets are small pellets, typically containing deuterium (2H) and tritium (3H).

Energy is deposited in the target&#x27;s outer layer, which explodes outward. This produces a reaction force in the form of shock waves that travel through the target. The waves compress and heat it. Sufficiently powerful shock waves will cause fusion of the fuel.

ICF is one of two major branches of fusion energy research; the other is magnetic confinement fusion (MCF). When first proposed in the early 1970s, ICF appeared to be a practical approach to power production and the field flourished. Experiments demonstrated that the efficiency of these devices was much lower than expected. Throughout the 1980s and &#x27;90s, experiments were conducted in order to understand the interaction of high-intensity laser light and plasma. These led to the design of much larger machines that achieved ignition-generating energies.

Unlike MCF, ICF has direct dual-use applications to the study of thermonuclear weapon detonation. For nuclear states, ICF forms a component of stockpile stewardship. This allows the allocation of not only scientific but military funding. 

The largest operational ICF experiment is the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in the US. In 2022, the NIF produced fusion, delivering 2.05 megajoules (MJ) of energy to the target which produced 3.15 MJ, the first time that an ICF device produced more energy than was delivered to the target.

==Description==
===Fusion basics===
Fusion reactions combine smaller atoms to form larger ones. This occurs when two atoms (or ions, atoms stripped of their electrons) come close enough to each other that the nuclear force dominates the electrostatic force that otherwise keeps them apart. Overcoming electrostatic repulsion requires kinetic energy sufficient to overcome the &quot;Coulomb barrier&quot; or &quot;fusion barrier&quot;.

Less energy is needed to cause lighter nuclei to fuse, as they have less electrical charge and thus a lower barrier energy. Thus the barrier is lowest for hydrogen. Conversely, the nuclear force increases with the number of nucleons, so isotopes of hydrogen that contain additional neutrons reduce the required energy. The easiest fuel is a mixture of 2H, and 3H, known as D-T.

The odds of fusion occurring are a function of the fuel density and temperature and the length of time that the density and temperature are maintained. Even under ideal conditions, the chance that a D and T pair fuse is very small. Higher density and longer times allow more encounters among the atoms. This cross section is further dependent on individual ion energies. This combination, the fusion triple product, must reach the Lawson criterion, to reach ignition.

===Thermonuclear devices===
The first ICF devices were the hydrogen bombs invented in the early 1950s. A hydrogen bomb consists of two bombs in a single case. The first, the &quot;primary stage&quot;, is a fission-powered device normally using plutonium. When it explodes it gives off a burst of thermal X-rays that fill the interior of the specially designed bomb casing. These X-rays are absorbed by a special material surrounding the &quot;secondary stage&quot;, which consists mostly of the fusion fuel. The X-rays heat this material and cause it to explode. Due to Newton&#x27;s Third Law, this causes the fuel inside to be driven inward, compressing and heating it. This causes the fusion fuel to reach the temperature and density where fusion reactions begin.

In the case of D-T fuel, most of the energy is released in the form of alpha particles and neutrons. Under normal conditions, an alpha can travel about 10 mm through the fuel, but in the ultra-dense conditions in the compressed fuel, they can travel about 0.01 mm before their electrical charge, interacting with the surrounding plasma, causes them to lose velocity. This means the majority of the energy released by the alphas is redeposited in the fuel. This transfer of kinetic energy heats the surrounding particles to the energies they need to undergo fusion. This process causes the fusion fuel to burn outward from the center. The electrically neutral neutrons travel longer distances in the fuel mass and do not contribute to this self-heating process. In a bomb, they are instead used to either breed tritium through reactions in a lithium-deuteride fuel, or are used to split additional fissionable fuel surrounding the secondary stage, often part of the bomb casing.

The requirement that the reaction has to be sparked by a fission bomb makes this method impractical for power generation. Not only would the fission triggers be expensive to produce, but the minimum size of such a bomb is large, defined roughly by the critical mass of the plutonium fuel used. Generally, it seems difficult to build efficient nuclear fusion devices much smaller than about 1 kiloton in yield, and the fusion secondary would add to this yield. This makes it a difficult engineering problem to extract power from the resulting explosions. Project PACER studied solutions to the engineering issues, but also demonstrated that it was not economically feasible. The cost of the bombs was far greater than the value of the resulting electricity.

===Mechanism of action ===
The energy needed to overcome the Coulomb barrier corresponds to the energy of the average particle in a gas heated to 100 million K. The specific heat of hydrogen is about 14 Joule per gram-K, so considering a 1 milligram fuel pellet, the energy needed to raise the mass as a whole to this temperature is 1.4 megajoules (MJ).

In the more widely developed magnetic fusion energy (MFE) approach, confinement times are on the order of one second. However, plasmas can be sustained for minutes. In this case the confinement time represents the amount of time it takes for the energy from the reaction to be lost to the environment - through a variety of mechanisms. For a one second confinement, the density needed to meet the Lawson criterion is about 1014 particles per cubic centimetre (cc). For comparison, air at sea level has about 2.7 x 1019 particles/cc, so the MFE approach has been described as &quot;a good vacuum&quot;.

Considering a 1 milligram drop of D-T fuel in liquid form, the size is about 1 mm and the density is about 4 x 1020/cc. Nothing holds the fuel together. Heat created by fusion events causes it to expand at the speed of sound, which leads to a confinement time around 2 x 10−10 seconds. At liquid density the required confinement time is about 2 x 10−7s. In this case only about 0.1 percent of the fuel fuses before the drop blows apart.

The rate of fusion reactions is a function of density, and density can be improved through compression. If the drop is compressed from 1 mm to 0.1 mm in diameter, the confinement time drops by the same factor of 10, because the particles have less distance to travel before they escape. However, the density, which is the cube of the dimensions, increases by 1,000 times. This means the overall rate of fusion increases 1,000 times while the confinement drops by 10 times, a 100-fold improvement. In this case 10% of the fuel undergoes fusion; 10% of 1 mg of fuel produces about 30 MJ of energy, 30 times the amount needed to compress it to that density.

The other key concept in ICF is that the entire fuel mass does not have to be raised to 100 million K. In a fusion bomb the reaction continues because the alpha particles released in the interior heat the fuel around it. At liquid density the alphas travel about 10 mm and thus their energy escapes the fuel. In the 0.1 mm compressed fuel, the alphas have a range of about 0.016 mm, meaning that they will stop within the fuel and heat it. In this case a &quot;propagating burn&quot; can be caused by heating only the center of the fuel to the needed temperature. This requires far less energy; calculations suggested 1 kJ is enough to reach the compression goal.

Some method is needed to heat the interior to fusion temperatures, and do so while when the fuel is compressed and the density is high enough. In modern ICF devices, the density of the compressed fuel mixture is as much as one-thousand times the density of water, or one-hundred times that of lead, around 1000 g/cm3. Much of the work since the 1970s has been on ways to create the central hot-spot that starts off the burning, and dealing with the many practical problems in reaching the desired density.

===Heating concepts===
Early calculations suggested that the amount of energy needed to ignite the fuel was very small, but this does not match subsequent experience.

==== Hot spot ignition ====
The initial solution to the heating problem involved deliberate &quot;shaping&quot; of the energy delivery. The idea was to use an initial lower-energy pulse to vaporize the capsule and cause compression, and then a very short, very powerful pulse near the end of the compression cycle. The goal is to launch shock waves into the compressed fuel that travel inward to the center. When they reach the center they meet the waves coming in from other sides. This causes a brief period where the density in the center reaches much higher values, over 800 g/cm3.

The central hot spot ignition concept was the first to suggest ICF was not only a practical route to fusion, but relatively simple. This led to numerous efforts to build working systems in the early 1970s. These experiments revealed unexpected loss mechanisms. Early calculations suggested about 4.5x107 J/g would be needed, but modern calculations place it closer to 108 J/g. Greater understanding led to complex shaping of the pulse into multiple time intervals.

==== Fast ignition ====
The fast ignition approach employs a separate laser to supply additional energy directly to the center of the fuel. This can be done mechanically, often using a small metal cone to puncture the outer fuel pellet wall to inject the energy into the center. In tests, this approach failed because the laser pulse had to reach the center at a precise moment, while the center is obscured by debris and free electrons from the compression pulse. It also has the disadvantage of requiring a second laser pulse, which generally involves a completely separate laser.

==== Shock ignition ====
Shock ignition is similar in concept to the hot-spot technique, but instead of achieving ignition via compression heating, a powerful shock wave is sent into the fuel at a later time through a combination of compression and shock heating. This increases the efficiency of the process while lowering the overall amount of power required.

=== Direct vs. indirect drive ===
In the simplest method of inertial confinement, the fuel is arranged as a sphere. This allows it to be compressed uniformly from all sides. To produce the inward force, the fuel is placed within a thin capsule that absorbs energy from the driver beams, causing the capsule shell to explode outward. The capsule shell is usually made of a lightweight plastic fabricated using plasma polymerization, and the fuel is deposited as a layer on the inside by injecting or diffusing the gaseous fuel into the shell and then freezing it. 

Shining the driver beams directly onto the fuel capsule is known as &quot;direct drive&quot;. The implosion process must be extremely uniform in order to avoid asymmetry due to Rayleigh–Taylor instability and similar effects. For a beam energy of 1 MJ, the fuel capsule cannot be larger than about 2 mm before these effects disrupt the implosion symmetry. This limits the size of the laser beams to a diameter so narrow that it is difficult to achieve in practice.

Alternatively &quot;indirect drive&quot; illuminates a small cylinder of heavy metal, often gold or lead, known as a hohlraum. The beam energy heats the hohlraum until it emits X-rays. These X-rays fill the interior of the hohlraum and heat the capsule. The advantage of indirect drive is that the beams can be larger and less accurate. The disadvantage is that much of the delivered energy is used to heat the hohlraum until it is &quot;X-ray hot&quot;, so the end-to-end energy efficiency is much lower than the direct drive method.

=== Polymer fuel capsule fabrication ===
For fuel capsules constructed using glow-discharge polymer (GDP) via plasma polymerization, outer diameters can range from 900 μm (typical for the OMEGA laser system at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics) to 2mm (typical for the NIF laser at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
The process for producing GDP capsules begins with a bubble of poly(α-methylstyrene) (PAMS) that serves as a decomposable mandrel. Next, the bubble is coated with GDP to the desired thickness. Finally, the coated bubble is heated in an inert atmosphere. Upon reaching 300 °C, the PAMS bubble decomposes into its monomers and diffuses out of the coating, leaving only a hollow sphere of the GDP coating. 

GDP lends itself to inertial fusion capsules—especially those used in direct-drive configurations—due to its ability to create low-defect, uniform thin films that are permeable to deuterium and tritium fuel. Permeating the fuel into the capsule precludes the need for drilling into the capsule to facilitate fuel injection, reducing the overall fusion target complexity and asymmetry. The rigorous uniformity and sphericity requirements of direct drive fusion experiments result in GDP being favored over other capsule materials. Additionally, the GDP layers can be doped with different elements to provide diagnostic signals or prevent preheating of the fuel. 

===Challenges===
The primary challenges with increasing ICF performance are:
* Improving the energy delivered to the target
* Controlling symmetry of the imploding fuel
* Delaying fuel heating until sufficient density is achieved
* Preventing premature mixing of hot and cool fuel by hydrodynamic instabilities
* Achieving shockwave convergence at the fuel center

In order to focus the shock wave on the center of the target, the target must be made with great precision and sphericity with tolerances of no more than a few micrometres over its (inner and outer) surface. The lasers must be precisely targeted in space and time. Beam timing is relatively simple and is solved by using delay lines in the beams&#x27; optical path to achieve picosecond accuracy. The other major issue is so-called &quot;beam-beam&quot; imbalance and beam anisotropy. These problems are, respectively, where the energy delivered by one beam may be higher or lower than other beams impinging and of &quot;hot spots&quot; within a beam diameter hitting a target which induces uneven compression on the target surface, thereby forming Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities in the fuel, prematurely mixing it and reducing heating efficacy at the instant of maximum compression. The Richtmyer-Meshkov instability is also formed during the process due to shock waves.

These problems have been mitigated by beam smoothing techniques and beam energy diagnostics; however, RT instability remains a major issue. Modern cryogenic hydrogen ice targets tend to freeze a thin layer of deuterium on the inside of the shell while irradiating it with a low power infrared laser to smooth its inner surface and monitoring it with a microscope equipped camera, thereby allowing the layer to be closely monitored. Cryogenic targets filled with D-T are &quot;self-smoothing&quot; due to the small amount of heat created by tritium decay. This is referred to as &quot;beta-layering&quot;.

In the indirect drive approach, the absorption of thermal x-rays by the target is more efficient than the direct absorption of laser light. However, the hohlraums take up considerable energy to heat, significantly reducing energy transfer efficiency. Most often, indirect drive hohlraum targets are used to simulate thermonuclear weapons tests due to the fact that the fusion fuel in weapons is also imploded mainly by X-ray radiation.

ICF drivers are evolving. Lasers have scaled up from a few joules and kilowatts to megajoules and hundreds of terawatts, using mostly frequency doubled or tripled light from neodymium glass amplifiers.

Heavy ion beams are particularly interesting for commercial generation, as they are easy to create, control, and focus. However, it is difficult to achieve the energy densities required to implode a target efficiently, and most ion-beam systems require the use of a hohlraum surrounding the target to smooth out the irradiation.

==History==
===Conception===

====United States====
ICF history began as part of the &quot;Atoms For Peace&quot; conference in 1957. This was an international, UN-sponsored conference between the US and the Soviet Union. Some thought was given to using a hydrogen bomb to heat a water-filled cavern. The resulting steam could then be used to power conventional generators, and thereby provide electrical power.

This meeting led to Operation Plowshare, formed in June 1957 and formally named in 1961. It included three primary concepts; energy generation under Project PACER, the use of nuclear explosions for excavation, and for fracking in the natural gas industry. PACER was directly tested in December 1961 when the 3 kt Project Gnome device was detonated in bedded salt in New Mexico. While the press looked on, radioactive steam was released from the drill shaft, at some distance from the test site. Further studies designed engineered cavities to replace natural ones, but Plowshare turned from bad to worse, especially after the failure of 1962&#x27;s Sedan which produced significant fallout. PACER continued to receive funding until 1975, when a 3rd party study demonstrated that the cost of electricity from PACER would be ten times the cost of conventional nuclear plants.

Another outcome of Atoms For Peace was to prompt John Nuckolls to consider what happens on the fusion side of the bomb as fuel mass is reduced. This work suggested that at sizes on the order of milligrams, little energy would be needed to ignite the fuel, much less than a fission primary. He proposed building, in effect, tiny all-fusion explosives using a tiny drop of D-T fuel suspended in the center of a hohlraum. The shell provided the same effect as the bomb casing in an H-bomb, trapping x-rays inside to irradiate the fuel. The main difference is that the X-rays would be supplied by an external device that heated the shell from the outside until it was glowing in the x-ray region. The power would be delivered by a then-unidentified pulsed power source he referred to, using bomb terminology, as the &quot;primary&quot;.

The main advantage to this scheme is the fusion efficiency at high densities. According to the Lawson criterion, the amount of energy needed to heat the D-T fuel to break-even conditions at ambient pressure is perhaps 100 times greater than the energy needed to compress it to a pressure that would deliver the same rate of fusion. So, in theory, the ICF approach could offer dramatically more gain. This can be understood by considering the energy losses in a conventional scenario where the fuel is slowly heated, as in the case of magnetic fusion energy; the rate of energy loss to the environment is based on the temperature difference between the fuel and its surroundings, which continues to increase as the fuel temperature increases. In the ICF case, the entire hohlraum is filled with high-temperature radiation, limiting losses.

==== Germany ====

In 1956 a meeting was organized at the Max Planck Institute in Germany by fusion pioneer Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. At this meeting Friedwardt Winterberg proposed the non-fission ignition of a thermonuclear micro-explosion by a convergent shock wave driven with high explosives. Further reference to Winterberg&#x27;s work in Germany on nuclear micro explosions (mininukes) is contained in a declassified report of the former East German Stasi (Staatsicherheitsdienst).

In 1964 Winterberg proposed that ignition could be achieved by an intense beam of microparticles accelerated to a velocity of 1000 km/s. In 1968, he proposed to use intense electron and ion beams generated by Marx generators for the same purpose. The advantage of this proposal is that charged particle beams are not only less expensive than laser beams, but can entrap the charged fusion reaction products due to the strong self-magnetic beam field, drastically reducing the compression requirements for beam ignited cylindrical targets.

==== USSR ====

In 1967, research fellow Gurgen Askaryan published an article proposing the use of focused laser beams in the fusion of lithium deuteride or deuterium.

===Early research===
Through the late 1950s, and collaborators at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) completed computer simulations of the ICF concept. In early 1960, they performed a full simulation of the implosion of 1 mg of D-T fuel inside a dense shell. The simulation suggested that a 5 MJ power input to the hohlraum would produce 50 MJ of fusion output, a gain of 10x. This was before the laser and a variety of other possible drivers were considered, including pulsed power machines, charged particle accelerators, plasma guns, and hypervelocity pellet guns.

Two theoretical advances advanced the field. One came from new simulations that considered the timing of the energy delivered in the pulse, known as &quot;pulse shaping&quot;, leading to better implosion. The second was to make the shell much larger and thinner, forming a thin shell as opposed to an almost solid ball. These two changes dramatically increased implosion efficiency and thereby greatly lowered the required compression energy. Using these improvements, it was calculated that a driver of about 1 MJ would be needed, a five-fold reduction. Over the next two years, other theoretical advancements were proposed, notably Ray Kidder&#x27;s development of an implosion system without a hohlraum, the so-called &quot;direct drive&quot; approach, and Stirling Colgate and Ron Zabawski&#x27;s work on systems with as little as 1 μg of D-T fuel.

The introduction of the laser in 1960 at Hughes Research Laboratories in California appeared to present a perfect driver mechanism. However, the maximum power produced by these devices appeared very limited, far below what would be needed. This was addressed with Gordon Gould&#x27;s introduction of the Q-switching which was applied to lasers in 1961 at Hughes Research Laboratories. Q-switching allows a laser amplifier to be pumped to very high energies without starting stimulated emission, and then triggered to release this energy in a burst by introducing a tiny seed signal. With this technique it appeared any limits to laser power were well into the region that would be useful for ICF.

Starting in 1962, Livermore&#x27;s director John S. Foster, Jr. and Edward Teller began a small ICF laser study. Even at this early stage the suitability of ICF for weapons research was well understood and was the primary reason for its funding. Over the next decade, LLNL made small experimental devices for basic laser-plasma interaction studies.

===Development begins===
In 1967 Kip Siegel started KMS Industries. In the early 1970s he formed KMS Fusion to begin development of a laser-based ICF system. This development led to considerable opposition from the weapons labs, including LLNL, who put forth a variety of reasons that KMS should not be allowed to develop ICF in public. This opposition was funnelled through the Atomic Energy Commission, which controlled funding. Adding to the background noise were rumours of an aggressive Soviet ICF program, new higher-powered CO2 and glass lasers, the electron beam driver concept, and the energy crisis which added impetus to many energy projects.

In 1972 John Nuckolls wrote a paper introducing ICF and suggesting that testbed systems could be made to generate fusion with drivers in the kJ range, and high-gain systems with MJ drivers.

In spite of limited resources and business problems, KMS Fusion successfully demonstrated IFC fusion on 1 May 1974. This success was soon followed by Siegel&#x27;s death and the end of KMS Fusion a year later. By this point several weapons labs and universities had started their own programs, notably the solid-state lasers (Nd:glass lasers) at LLNL and the University of Rochester, and krypton fluoride excimer lasers systems at Los Alamos and the Naval Research Laboratory.

===&quot;High-energy&quot; ICF===
High-energy ICF experiments (multi-hundred joules per shot) began in the early 1970s, when better lasers appeared. Funding for fusion research was stimulated by energy crises produced rapid gains in performance, and inertial designs were soon reaching the same sort of &quot;below break-even&quot; conditions of the best MCF systems.

LLNL was, in particular, well funded and started a laser fusion development program. Their Janus laser started operation in 1974, and validated the approach of using Nd:glass lasers for high power devices. Focusing problems were explored in the Long path and Cyclops lasers, which led to the larger Argus laser. None of these were intended to be practical devices, but they increased confidence that the approach was valid. It was then believed that a much larger device of the Cyclops type could both compress and heat targets, leading to ignition. This misconception was based on extrapolation of the fusion yields seen from experiments utilizing the so-called &quot;exploding pusher&quot; fuel capsule. During the late 1970s and early 1980s the estimates for laser energy on target needed to achieve ignition doubled almost yearly as plasma instabilities and laser-plasma energy coupling loss modes were increasingly understood. The realization that exploding pusher target designs and single-digit kilojoule (kJ) laser irradiation intensities would never scale to high yields led to the effort to increase laser energies to the 100 kJ level in the ultraviolet band and to the production of advanced ablator and cryogenic DT ice target designs.

===Shiva and Nova===
One of the earliest large scale attempts at an ICF driver design was the Shiva laser, a 20-beam neodymium doped glass laser system at LLNL that started operation in 1978. Shiva was a &quot;proof of concept&quot; design intended to demonstrate compression of fusion fuel capsules to many times the liquid density of hydrogen. In this, Shiva succeeded, reaching 100 times the liquid density of deuterium. However, due to the laser&#x27;s coupling with hot electrons, premature heating of the dense plasma was problematic and fusion yields were low. This failure to efficiently heat the compressed plasma pointed to the use of optical frequency multipliers as a solution that would frequency triple the infrared light from the laser into the ultraviolet at 351 nm. Schemes to efficiently triple the frequency of laser light discovered at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics in 1980 was experimented with in the 24 beam OMEGA laser and the NOVETTE laser, which was followed by the Nova laser design with 10 times Shiva&#x27;s energy, the first design with the specific goal of reaching ignition.

Nova also failed, this time due to severe variation in laser intensity in its beams (and differences in intensity between beams) caused by filamentation that resulted in large non-uniformity in irradiation smoothness at the target and asymmetric implosion. The techniques pioneered earlier could not address these new issues. This failure led to a much greater understanding of the process of implosion, and the way forward again seemed clear, namely to increase the uniformity of irradiation, reduce hot-spots in the laser beams through beam smoothing techniques to reduce Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities and increase laser energy on target by at least an order of magnitude. Funding was constrained in the 1980s.

===National Ignition Facility===

The resulting 192-beam design, dubbed the National Ignition Facility, started construction at LLNL in 1997. NIF&#x27;s main objective is to operate as the flagship experimental device of the so-called nuclear stewardship program, supporting LLNLs traditional bomb-making role. Completed in March 2009, NIF experiments set new records for power delivery by a laser. As of September 27, 2013, for the first time fusion energy generated was greater than the energy absorbed into deuterium–tritium fuel. In June, 2018 NIF announced record production of 54kJ of fusion energy output. On August 8, 2021 the NIF produced 1.3MJ of output, 25x higher than the 2018 result, generating 70% of the break-even definition of ignition - when energy out equals energy in.
As of December 2022, the NIF claims to have become the first fusion experiment to achieve scientific breakeven on December 5, 2022, with an experiment producing 3.15 megajoules of energy from a 2.05 megajoule input of laser light (somewhat less than the energy needed to boil 1 kg of water) for an energy gain of about 1.5.

===Fast ignition===
Fast ignition may offer a way to directly heat fuel after compression, thus decoupling the heating and compression phases. In this approach, the target is first compressed &quot;normally&quot; using a laser system. When the implosion reaches maximum density (at the stagnation point or &quot;bang time&quot;), a second short, high-power petawatt (PW) laser delivers a single pulse to one side of the core, dramatically heating it and starting ignition.

The two types of fast ignition are the &quot;plasma bore-through&quot; method and the &quot;cone-in-shell&quot; method. In plasma bore-through, the second laser bores through the outer plasma of an imploding capsule, impinges on and heats the core. In the cone-in-shell method, the capsule is mounted on the end of a small high-z (high atomic number) cone such that the tip of the cone projects into the core. In this second method, when the capsule is imploded, the laser has a clear view of the core and does not use energy to bore through a &#x27;corona&#x27; plasma. However, the presence of the cone affects the implosion process in significant ways that are not fully understood. Several projects are currently underway to explore fast ignition, including upgrades to the OMEGA laser at the University of Rochester and the GEKKO XII device in Japan.

HiPer is a proposed £500 million facility in the European Union. Compared to NIF&#x27;s 2 MJ UV beams, HiPER&#x27;s driver was planned to be 200 kJ and heater 70 kJ, although the predicted fusion gains are higher than NIF. It was to employ diode lasers, which convert electricity into laser light with much higher efficiency and run cooler. This allows them to operate at much higher frequencies. HiPER proposed to operate at 1 MJ at 1 Hz, or alternately 100 kJ at 10 Hz. The project&#x27;s final update was in 2014. It was expected to offer a higher &quot;Q&quot; with a 10x reduction in construction costs times.

===Other projects===
The French Laser Mégajoule achieved its first experimental line in 2002, and its first target shots were conducted in 2014. The machine was roughly 75% complete as of 2016.

Using a different approach entirely is the &quot;z&quot;-pinch device. &quot;Z&quot;-pinch uses massive electric currents switched into a cylinder comprising extremely fine wires. The wires vaporize to form an electrically conductive, high current plasma. The resulting circumferential magnetic field squeezes the plasma cylinder, imploding it, generating a high-power x-ray pulse that can be used to implode a fuel capsule. Challenges to this approach include relatively low drive temperatures, resulting in slow implosion velocities and potentially large instability growth, and preheat caused by high-energy x-rays.

Shock ignition was proposed to address problems with fast ignition. Japan developed the KOYO-F design and laser inertial fusion test (LIFT) experimental reactor. In April 2017, clean energy startup Apollo Fusion began to develop a hybrid fusion-fission reactor technology.

In Germany, technology company Marvel Fusion is working on laser-initiated inertial confinement fusion. The startup adopted a short-pulsed high energy laser and the aneutronic fuel pB11. It was founded in Munich 2019. It works with Siemens Energy, TRUMPF, and Thales. The company partnered with Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in July 2022.

In March 2022, Australian company HB11 announced fusion using non-thermal laser pB11, at a higher than predicted rate of alpha particle creation. Other companies include NIF-like Longview Fusion and fast-ignition origned Focused Energy.

== Applications ==

=== Electricity generation ===
Inertial fusion energy (IFE) power plants have been studied since the late 1970s. These devices were to deliver multiple targets per second into the reaction chamber, using the resulting energy to drive a conventional steam turbine.

==== Technical challenges ====
Even if the many technical challenges in reaching ignition were all to be solved, practical problems abound. Given the 1 to 1.5% efficiency of the laser amplification process and that steam-driven turbine systems are typically about 35% efficient, fusion gains would have to be on the order of 125-fold just to energetically break even.

An order of magnitude improvement in laser efficiency may be possible through the use of designs that replace flash lamps with laser diodes that are tuned to produce most of their energy in a frequency range that is strongly absorbed. Initial experimental devices offer efficiencies of about 10%, and it is suggested that 20% is possible.

NIF uses about 330 MJ to produce the driver beams, producing an expected yield of about 20 MJ, with maximum credible yield of 45 MJ.

==== Power extraction ====
ICF systems face some of the secondary power extraction problems as MCF systems. One of the primary concerns is how to successfully remove heat from the reaction chamber without interfering with the targets and driver beams. Another concern is that the released neutrons react with the reactor structure, mechanically weakening it, and turning it intensely radioactive. Conventional metals such as steel would have a short lifetime and require frequent replacement of the core containment walls. Another concern is fusion afterdamp (debris left in the reaction chamber), which could interfere with subsequent shots, including helium ash produced by fusion, along with unburned hydrogen and other elements used in the fuel pellet. This problem is most troublesome with indirect drive systems. If the driver energy misses the fuel pellet completely and strikes the containment chamber, material could foul the interaction region, or the lenses or focusing elements.

One concept, as shown in the HYLIFE-II design, is to use a &quot;waterfall&quot; of FLiBe, a molten mix of fluoride salts of lithium and beryllium, which both protect the chamber from neutrons and carry away heat. The FLiBe is passed into a heat exchanger where it heats water for the turbines. The tritium produced by splitting lithium nuclei can be extracted in order to close the power plant&#x27;s thermonuclear fuel cycle, a necessity for perpetual operation because tritium is rare and otherwise must be manufactured. Another concept, Sombrero, uses a reaction chamber built of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer which has a low neutron cross section. Cooling is provided by a molten ceramic, chosen because of its ability to absorb the neutrons and its efficiency as a heat transfer agent.

==== Economic viability ====
Another factor working against IFE is the cost of the fuel. Even as Nuckolls was developing his earliest calculations, co-workers pointed out that if an IFE machine produces 50 MJ of fusion energy, a shot could produce perhaps 10 MJ (2.8 kWh) of energy. Wholesale rates for electrical power on the grid were about 0.3 cents/kWh at the time, which meant the monetary value of the shot was perhaps one cent. In the intervening 50 years the real price of power has remained about even, and the rate in 2012 in Ontario, Canada was about 2.8 cents/kWh. Thus, in order for an IFE plant to be economically viable, fuel shots would have to cost considerably less than ten cents in 2012 dollars.

Direct-drive systems avoid the use of a hohlraum and thereby may be less expensive in fuel terms. However, these systems still require an ablator, and the accuracy and geometrical considerations are critical. The direct-drive approach still may not be less expensive to operate.

=== Nuclear weapons ===
The hot and dense conditions encountered during an ICF experiment are similar to those in a thermonuclear weapon, and have applications to nuclear weapons programs. When energy is put into the fuel pellets, the result is shock-wave explosions. With enough shock waves, the fuel pellets combine to form helium, and a free neutron and energy is released. ICF experiments might be used, for example, to help determine how warhead performance degrades as it ages, or as part of a weapons design program. Retaining knowledge and expertise inside the nuclear weapons program is another motivation for pursuing ICF. Funding for the NIF in the United States is sourced from the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Stewardship program, whose goals are oriented accordingly. It has been argued that some aspects of ICF research violate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty or the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In the long term, despite the formidable technical hurdles, ICF research could lead to the creation of a &quot;pure fusion weapon&quot;.

=== Neutron source ===
ICF has the potential to produce orders of magnitude more neutrons than spallation. Neutrons are capable of locating hydrogen atoms in molecules, resolving atomic thermal motion and studying collective excitations of photons more effectively than X-rays. Neutron scattering studies of molecular structures could resolve problems associated with protein folding, diffusion through membranes, proton transfer mechanisms, dynamics of molecular motors, etc. by modulating thermal neutrons into beams of slow neutrons. In combination with fissile materials, neutrons produced by ICF can potentially be used in Hybrid Nuclear Fusion designs to produce electric power.

<doc id="40324" wikidata="Q290117" url="?curid=40324" title="Quadratic programming">
<text>Quadratic programming (QP) is the process of solving certain mathematical optimization problems involving quadratic functions. Specifically, one seeks to optimize (minimize or maximize) a multivariate quadratic function subject to linear constraints on the variables. Quadratic programming is a type of nonlinear programming.

&quot;Programming&quot; in this context refers to a formal procedure for solving mathematical problems. This usage dates to the 1940s and is not specifically tied to the more recent notion of &quot;computer programming.&quot; To avoid confusion, some practitioners prefer the term &quot;optimization&quot; — e.g., &quot;quadratic optimization.&quot;

==Problem formulation==
The quadratic programming problem with variables and constraints can be formulated as follows.
Given:
* a real-valued, -dimensional vector ,
* an -dimensional real symmetric matrix ,
* an -dimensional real matrix , and
* an -dimensional real vector ,
the objective of quadratic programming is to find an -dimensional vector , that will
where denotes the vector transpose of , and the notation means that every entry of the vector is less than or equal to the corresponding entry of the vector (component-wise inequality).

===Constrained least squares===

As a special case when is symmetric positive-definite, the cost function reduces to least squares:
where follows from the Cholesky decomposition of and . Conversely, any such constrained least squares program can be equivalently framed as a quadratic programming problem, even for a generic non-square matrix.

===Generalizations===

When minimizing a function in the neighborhood of some reference point , is set to its Hessian matrix and is set to its gradient . A related programming problem, quadratically constrained quadratic programming, can be posed by adding quadratic constraints on the variables.

==Solution methods==

For general problems a variety of methods are commonly used, including

:*interior point,
:*active set,
:*augmented Lagrangian,
:*conjugate gradient,
:*gradient projection,
:*extensions of the simplex algorithm.

In the case in which is positive definite, the problem is a special case of the more general field of convex optimization.

===Equality constraints===

Quadratic programming is particularly simple when is positive definite and there are only equality constraints; specifically, the solution process is linear. By using Lagrange multipliers and seeking the extremum of the Lagrangian, it may be readily shown that the solution to the equality constrained problem

:formula_1

:formula_2

is given by the linear system

:formula_3

where is a set of Lagrange multipliers which come out of the solution alongside .

The easiest means of approaching this system is direct solution (for example, LU factorization), which for small problems is very practical. For large problems, the system poses some unusual difficulties, most notably that the problem is never positive definite (even if is), making it potentially very difficult to find a good numeric approach, and there are many approaches to choose from dependent on the problem.

If the constraints don&#x27;t couple the variables too tightly, a relatively simple attack is to change the variables so that constraints are unconditionally satisfied. For example, suppose (generalizing to nonzero is straightforward). Looking at the constraint equations:

:formula_4

introduce a new variable defined by

:formula_5

where has dimension of minus the number of constraints. Then

:formula_6

and if is chosen so that the constraint equation will be always satisfied. Finding such entails finding the null space of , which is more or less simple depending on the structure of . Substituting into the quadratic form gives an unconstrained minimization problem:

:formula_7

the solution of which is given by:

:formula_8

Under certain conditions on , the reduced matrix will be positive definite. It is possible to write a variation on the conjugate gradient method which avoids the explicit calculation of .

==Lagrangian duality==
The Lagrangian dual of a quadratic programming problem is also a quadratic programming problem. To see this let us focus on the case where and is positive definite. We write the Lagrangian function as 
:formula_9
Defining the (Lagrangian) dual function as formula_10, we find an infimum of , using formula_11 and positive-definiteness of :

:formula_12

Hence the dual function is 
:formula_13
and so the Lagrangian dual of the quadratic programming problem is

:formula_14

Besides the Lagrangian duality theory, there are other duality pairings (e.g. Wolfe, etc.).

==Run-time complexity==

=== Convex quadratic programming ===
For positive definite , when the problem is convex, the ellipsoid method solves the problem in (weakly) polynomial time.

Ye and Tse present a polynomial-time algorithm, which extends Karmarkar&#x27;s algorithm from linear programming to convex quadratic programming. On a system with &quot;n&quot; variables and &quot;L&quot; input bits, their algorithm requires O(L n) iterations, each of which can be done using O(L n3) arithmetic operations, for a total runtime complexity of O(&quot;L&quot;2 &quot;n&quot;4). 

Kapoor and Vaidya present another algorithm, which requires O(&quot;L&quot; * log &quot;L&quot; &quot;* n&quot;3.67 * log &quot;n&quot;) arithmetic operations.

=== Non-convex quadratic programming ===
If is indefinite, (so the problem is non-convex) then the problem is NP-hard. A simple way to see this is to consider the non-convex quadratic constraint &quot;xi&quot;2 = &quot;xi&quot;. This constraint is equivalent to requiring that &quot;xi&quot; is in {0,1}, that is, &quot;xi&quot; is a binary integer variable. Therefore, such constraints can be used to model any integer program with binary variables, which is known to be NP-hard.

Moreover, these non-convex problems might have several stationary points and local minima. In fact, even if has only one negative eigenvalue, the problem is (strongly) NP-hard.

Moreover, finding a KKT point of a non-convex quadratic program is CLS-hard.

== Mixed-integer quadratic programming ==
There are some situations where one or more elements of the vector will need to take on integer values. This leads to the formulation of a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. Applications of MIQP include water resources and the construction of index funds.

==Solvers and scripting (programming) languages==

== Extensions ==
Polynomial optimization is a more general framework, in which the constraints can be polynomial functions of any degree, not only 2.

<text>In mathematics, a symmetric matrix formula_1 with real entries is positive-definite if the real number formula_2 is positive for every nonzero real column vector formula_3 where formula_4 is the row vector transpose of formula_5
More generally, a Hermitian matrix (that is, a complex matrix equal to its conjugate transpose) is positive-definite if the real number formula_6 is positive for every nonzero complex column vector formula_7 where formula_8 denotes the conjugate transpose of formula_9

Positive semi-definite matrices are defined similarly, except that the scalars formula_2 and formula_6 are required to be positive &quot;or zero&quot; (that is, nonnegative). Negative-definite and negative semi-definite matrices are defined analogously. A matrix that is not positive semi-definite and not negative semi-definite is sometimes called &quot;indefinite&quot;.

Some authors use more general definitions of definiteness, permitting the matrices to be non-symmetric or non-Hermitian. The properties of these generalized definite matrices are explored in the section #Extension for non-Hermitian square matrices below, but are not the main focus of this article.

== Ramifications ==
It follows from the above definitions that a matrix is positive-definite if and only if it is the matrix of a positive-definite quadratic form or Hermitian form. In other words, a matrix is positive-definite if and only if it defines an inner product.

Positive-definite and positive-semidefinite matrices can be characterized in many ways, which may explain the importance of the concept in various parts of mathematics. A matrix is positive-definite if and only if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions.
* formula_1 is congruent with a diagonal matrix with positive real entries. 
* formula_1 is symmetric or Hermitian, and all its eigenvalues are real and positive.
* formula_1 is symmetric or Hermitian, and all its leading principal minors are positive.
* There exists an invertible matrix formula_15 with conjugate transpose formula_16 such that formula_17
A matrix is positive semi-definite if it satisfies similar equivalent conditions where &quot;positive&quot; is replaced by &quot;nonnegative&quot;, &quot;invertible matrix&quot; is replaced by &quot;matrix&quot;, and the word &quot;leading&quot; is removed.

Positive-definite and positive-semidefinite real matrices are at the basis of convex optimization, since, given a function of several real variables that is twice differentiable, then if its Hessian matrix (matrix of its second partial derivatives) is positive-definite at a point formula_18 then the function is convex near , and, conversely, if the function is convex near formula_18 then the Hessian matrix is positive-semidefinite at formula_20

The set of positive definite matrices is an open convex cone, while the set of positive semi-definite matrices is a closed convex cone.

== Definitions ==
In the following definitions, formula_4 is the transpose of formula_3 formula_8 is the conjugate transpose of formula_7 and formula_25 denotes the zero-vector.

=== Definitions for real matrices ===
An formula_26 symmetric real matrix formula_1 is said to be positive-definite if formula_28 for all non-zero formula_29 in formula_30 Formally,

An formula_26 symmetric real matrix formula_1 is said to be positive-semidefinite or non-negative-definite if formula_33 for all formula_29 in formula_35 Formally,

An formula_26 symmetric real matrix formula_1 is said to be negative-definite if formula_38 for all non-zero formula_29 in formula_40 Formally,

An formula_26 symmetric real matrix formula_1 is said to be negative-semidefinite or non-positive-definite if formula_43 for all formula_29 in formula_35 Formally,

An formula_26 symmetric real matrix which is neither positive semidefinite nor negative semidefinite is called indefinite.

=== Definitions for complex matrices ===
The following definitions all involve the term formula_47 Notice that this is always a real number for any Hermitian square matrix formula_48

An formula_26 Hermitian complex matrix formula_1 is said to be positive-definite if formula_51 for all non-zero formula_52 in formula_53 Formally,

An formula_26 Hermitian complex matrix formula_1 is said to be positive semi-definite or non-negative-definite if formula_56 for all formula_52 in formula_53 Formally,

An formula_26 Hermitian complex matrix formula_1 is said to be negative-definite if formula_61 for all non-zero formula_52 in formula_53 Formally,

An formula_26 Hermitian complex matrix formula_1 is said to be negative semi-definite or non-positive-definite if formula_66 for all formula_52 in formula_53 Formally,

An formula_26 Hermitian complex matrix which is neither positive semidefinite nor negative semidefinite is called indefinite.

=== Consistency between real and complex definitions ===
Since every real matrix is also a complex matrix, the definitions of &quot;definiteness&quot; for the two classes must agree.

For complex matrices, the most common definition says that formula_1 is positive-definite if and only if formula_71 is real and positive for every non-zero complex column vectors formula_72 This condition implies that formula_1 is Hermitian (i.e. its transpose is equal to its conjugate), since formula_71 being real, it equals its conjugate transpose formula_75 for every formula_7 which implies formula_77 

By this definition, a positive-definite &quot;real&quot; matrix formula_1 is Hermitian, hence symmetric; and formula_79 is positive for all non-zero &quot;real&quot; column vectors formula_72 However the last condition alone is not sufficient for formula_1 to be positive-definite. For example, if
formula_82

then for any real vector formula_52 with entries formula_84 and formula_85 we have formula_86 which is always positive if formula_52 is not zero. However, if formula_52 is the complex vector with entries and formula_89 one gets

formula_90

which is not real. Therefore, formula_1 is not positive-definite.

On the other hand, for a &quot;symmetric&quot; real matrix formula_92 the condition &quot;formula_93 for all nonzero real vectors formula_52&quot; &quot;does&quot; imply that formula_1 is positive-definite in the complex sense.

===Notation===
If a Hermitian matrix formula_1 is positive semi-definite, one sometimes writes formula_97 and if formula_1 is positive-definite one writes formula_99 To denote that formula_1 is negative semi-definite one writes formula_101 and to denote that formula_1 is negative-definite one writes formula_103

The notion comes from functional analysis where positive semidefinite matrices define positive operators. If two matrices formula_104 and formula_15 satisfy formula_106 we can define a non-strict partial order formula_107 that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive; It is not a total order, however, as formula_108 in general, may be indefinite.

A common alternative notation is formula_109 formula_110 formula_111 and formula_112 for positive semi-definite and positive-definite, negative semi-definite and negative-definite matrices, respectively. This may be confusing, as sometimes nonnegative matrices (respectively, nonpositive matrices) are also denoted in this way.

== Examples ==
== Eigenvalues ==
Let formula_1 be an formula_26 Hermitian matrix (this includes real symmetric matrices). All eigenvalues of formula_1 are real, and their sign characterize its definiteness:
* formula_1 is positive definite if and only if all of its eigenvalues are positive.
* formula_1 is positive semi-definite if and only if all of its eigenvalues are non-negative.
* formula_1 is negative definite if and only if all of its eigenvalues are negative.
* formula_1 is negative semi-definite if and only if all of its eigenvalues are non-positive.
* formula_1 is indefinite if and only if it has both positive and negative eigenvalues.

Let formula_121 be an eigendecomposition of formula_92 where formula_123 is a unitary complex matrix whose columns comprise an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of formula_92 and formula_125 is a &quot;real&quot; diagonal matrix whose main diagonal contains the corresponding eigenvalues. The matrix formula_1 may be regarded as a diagonal matrix formula_125 that has been re-expressed in coordinates of the (eigenvectors) basis formula_128 Put differently, applying formula_1 to some vector formula_7 giving formula_131 is the same as changing the basis to the eigenvector coordinate system using formula_132 giving formula_133 applying the stretching transformation formula_125 to the result, giving formula_135 and then changing the basis back using formula_136 giving formula_137

With this in mind, the one-to-one change of variable formula_138 shows that formula_71 is real and positive for any complex vector formula_52 if and only if formula_141 is real and positive for any formula_142 in other words, if formula_125 is positive definite. For a diagonal matrix, this is true only if each element of the main diagonal – that is, every eigenvalue of formula_1 – is positive. Since the spectral theorem guarantees all eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix to be real, the positivity of eigenvalues can be checked using Descartes&#x27; rule of alternating signs when the characteristic polynomial of a real, symmetric matrix formula_1 is available.

==Decomposition==

Let formula_1 be an formula_26 Hermitian matrix.
formula_1 is positive semidefinite if and only if it can be decomposed as a product
formula_149
of a matrix formula_15 with its conjugate transpose.

When formula_1 is real, formula_15 can be real as well and the decomposition can be written as formula_153

formula_1 is positive definite if and only if such a decomposition exists with formula_15 invertible.
More generally, formula_1 is positive semidefinite with rank formula_157 if and only if a decomposition exists with a formula_158 matrix formula_15 of full row rank (i.e. of rank formula_157).
Moreover, for any decomposition formula_161 formula_162

&lt;/math&gt; as the diagonal matrix whose entries are non-negative square roots of eigenvalues.
Then formula_163 for formula_164
If moreover formula_1 is positive definite, then the eigenvalues are (strictly) positive, so formula_166 is invertible, and hence formula_167 is invertible as well.
If formula_1 has rank formula_169 then it has exactly formula_157 positive eigenvalues and the others are zero, hence in formula_167 all but formula_157 rows are all zeroed.
Cutting the zero rows gives a formula_158 matrix formula_174 such that formula_175

The columns formula_176 of formula_15 can be seen as vectors in the complex or real vector space formula_178 respectively.
Then the entries of formula_1 are inner products (that is dot products, in the real case) of these vectors
formula_180
In other words, a Hermitian matrix formula_1 is positive semidefinite if and only if it is the Gram matrix of some vectors formula_182
It is positive definite if and only if it is the Gram matrix of some linearly independent vectors.
In general, the rank of the Gram matrix of vectors formula_176 equals the dimension of the space spanned by these vectors.

===Uniqueness up to unitary transformations===
The decomposition is not unique: 
if formula_184 for some formula_158 matrix formula_15 and if formula_187 is any unitary formula_188 matrix (meaning formula_189),
then formula_190 for formula_191

However, this is the only way in which two decompositions can differ: The decomposition is unique up to unitary transformations.
More formally, if formula_104 is a formula_158 matrix and formula_15 is a formula_195 matrix such that formula_196
then there is a formula_197 matrix formula_187 with orthonormal columns (meaning formula_199) such that formula_200
When formula_201 this means formula_187 is unitary.

This statement has an intuitive geometric interpretation in the real case:
let the columns of formula_104 and formula_15 be the vectors formula_205 and formula_176 in formula_207
A real unitary matrix is an orthogonal matrix, which describes a rigid transformation (an isometry of Euclidean space formula_208) preserving the 0 point (i.e. rotations and reflections, without translations). 
Therefore, the dot products formula_209 and formula_210 are equal if and only if some rigid transformation of formula_208 transforms the vectors formula_205 to formula_213 (and 0 to 0).

===Square root===

A Hermitian matrix formula_1 is positive semidefinite if and only if there is a positive semidefinite matrix formula_15 (in particular formula_15 is Hermitian, so formula_217) satisfying formula_218 This matrix formula_15 is unique, is called the &quot;non-negative square root&quot; of formula_92 and is denoted with formula_221
When formula_1 is positive definite, so is formula_223 hence it is also called the &quot;positive square root&quot; of formula_48

The non-negative square root should not be confused with other decompositions formula_225
Some authors use the name &quot;square root&quot; and formula_226 for any such decomposition, or specifically for the Cholesky decomposition,
or any decomposition of the form formula_227
others only use it for the non-negative square root.

If formula_228 then formula_229

===Cholesky decomposition===
A Hermitian positive semidefinite matrix formula_1 can be written as formula_231 where formula_232 is lower triangular with non-negative diagonal (equivalently formula_233 where formula_234 is upper triangular); this is the Cholesky decomposition.
If formula_1 is positive definite, then the diagonal of formula_232 is positive and the Cholesky decomposition is unique. Conversely if formula_232 is lower triangular with nonnegative diagonal then formula_238 is positive semidefinite. 
The Cholesky decomposition is especially useful for efficient numerical calculations.
A closely related decomposition is the LDL decomposition, formula_239 where formula_125 is diagonal and formula_232 is lower unitriangular.

===Williamson theorem===
Any formula_242 positive definite Hermitian real matrix formula_243 can be diagonalized via symplectic (real) matrices. More precisely, Williamson&#x27;s theorem ensures the existence of symplectic formula_244 and diagonal real positive formula_245 such that formula_246.

== Other characterizations ==
Let formula_1 be an formula_26 real symmetric matrix, and let formula_249 be the &quot;unit ball&quot; defined by formula_48 Then we have the following

* formula_251 is a solid slab sandwiched between formula_252
* formula_97 if and only if formula_254 is an ellipsoid, or an ellipsoidal cylinder.
* formula_255 if and only if formula_254 is bounded, that is, it is an ellipsoid.
* If formula_257 then formula_258 if and only if formula_259 formula_260 if and only if formula_261
* If formula_257 then formula_263 for all formula_264 if and only if formula_265 So, since the polar dual of an ellipsoid is also an ellipsoid with the same principal axes, with inverse lengths, we have formula_266 That is, if formula_267 is positive-definite, then formula_268 for all formula_269 if and only if formula_270
Let formula_1 be an formula_26 Hermitian matrix. The following properties are equivalent to formula_1 being positive definite:
; The associated sesquilinear form is an inner product: The sesquilinear form defined by formula_1 is the function formula_275 from formula_276 to formula_277 such that formula_278 for all formula_29 and formula_280 in formula_281 where formula_282 is the conjugate transpose of formula_283 For any complex matrix formula_92 this form is linear in formula_285 and semilinear in formula_283 Therefore, the form is an inner product on formula_277 if and only if formula_288 is real and positive for all nonzero formula_289 that is if and only if formula_1 is positive definite. (In fact, every inner product on formula_277 arises in this fashion from a Hermitian positive definite matrix.)
; Its leading principal minors are all positive: The th leading principal minor of a matrix formula_1 is the determinant of its upper-left formula_188 sub-matrix. It turns out that a matrix is positive definite if and only if all these determinants are positive. This condition is known as Sylvester&#x27;s criterion, and provides an efficient test of positive definiteness of a symmetric real matrix. Namely, the matrix is reduced to an upper triangular matrix by using elementary row operations, as in the first part of the Gaussian elimination method, taking care to preserve the sign of its determinant during pivoting process. Since the th leading principal minor of a triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal elements up to row formula_169 Sylvester&#x27;s criterion is equivalent to checking whether its diagonal elements are all positive. This condition can be checked each time a new row formula_157 of the triangular matrix is obtained.

A positive semidefinite matrix is positive definite if and only if it is invertible.
A matrix formula_1 is negative (semi)definite if and only if formula_297 is positive (semi)definite.

== Quadratic forms ==

The (purely) quadratic form associated with a real formula_26 matrix formula_1 is the function formula_300 such that formula_301 for all formula_302 formula_1 can be assumed symmetric by replacing it with formula_304 since any asymmetric part will be zeroed-out in the double-sided product.

A symmetric matrix formula_1 is positive definite if and only if its quadratic form is a strictly convex function.

More generally, any quadratic function from formula_306 to formula_307 can be written as formula_308 where formula_1 is a symmetric formula_26 matrix, formula_311 is a real and formula_312 a real constant. In the formula_313 case, this is a parabola, and just like in the formula_313 case, we have

Theorem: This quadratic function is strictly convex, and hence has a unique finite global minimum, if and only if formula_1 is positive definite.

Proof: If formula_1 is positive definite, then the function is strictly convex. Its gradient is zero at the unique point of formula_317 which must be the global minimum since the function is strictly convex. If formula_1 is not positive definite, then there exists some vector formula_319 such that formula_320 so the function formula_321 is a line or a downward parabola, thus not strictly convex and not having a global minimum.

For this reason, positive definite matrices play an important role in optimization problems.

== Simultaneous diagonalization ==
One symmetric matrix and another matrix that is both symmetric and positive definite can be simultaneously diagonalized. This is so although simultaneous diagonalization is not necessarily performed with a similarity transformation. This result does not extend to the case of three or more matrices. In this section we write for the real case. Extension to the complex case is immediate.

Let formula_1 be a symmetric and formula_267 a symmetric and positive definite matrix. Write the generalized eigenvalue equation as formula_324 where we impose that formula_29 be normalized, i.e. formula_326 Now we use Cholesky decomposition to write the inverse of formula_267 as formula_328 Multiplying by formula_187 and letting formula_330 we get formula_331 which can be rewritten as formula_332 where formula_333 Manipulation now yields formula_334 where formula_335 is a matrix having as columns the generalized eigenvectors and formula_336 is a diagonal matrix of the generalized eigenvalues. Now premultiplication with formula_337 gives the final result: formula_338 and formula_339 but note that this is no longer an orthogonal diagonalization with respect to the inner product where formula_333 In fact, we diagonalized formula_1 with respect to the inner product induced by formula_342

Note that this result does not contradict what is said on simultaneous diagonalization in the article Diagonalizable matrix, which refers to simultaneous diagonalization by a similarity transformation. Our result here is more akin to a simultaneous diagonalization of two quadratic forms, and is useful for optimization of one form under conditions on the other.

== Properties ==
===Induced partial ordering===
For arbitrary square matrices formula_92 formula_267 we write formula_345 if formula_346 i.e., formula_347 is positive semi-definite. This defines a partial ordering on the set of all square matrices. One can similarly define a strict partial ordering formula_348 The ordering is called the Loewner order.

===Inverse of positive definite matrix===
Every positive definite matrix is invertible and its inverse is also positive definite. If formula_349 then formula_350 Moreover, by the min-max theorem, the th largest eigenvalue of formula_1 is greater than or equal to the th largest eigenvalue of formula_342

=== Scaling ===
If formula_1 is positive definite and formula_354 is a real number, then formula_355 is positive definite.

=== Addition ===
* If formula_1 and formula_267 are positive-definite, then the sum formula_358 is also positive-definite.
* If formula_1 and formula_267 are positive-semidefinite, then the sum formula_358 is also positive-semidefinite.
* If formula_1 is positive-definite and formula_267 is positive-semidefinite, then the sum formula_358 is also positive-definite.

===Multiplication===
* If formula_1 and formula_267 are positive definite, then the products formula_367 and formula_368 are also positive definite. If formula_369 then formula_370 is also positive definite.
* If formula_1 is positive semidefinite, then formula_372 is positive semidefinite for any (possibly rectangular) matrix formula_373 If formula_1 is positive definite and formula_104 has full column rank, then formula_372 is positive definite.

===Trace===
The diagonal entries formula_377 of a positive-semidefinite matrix are real and non-negative. As a consequence the trace, formula_378 Furthermore, since every principal sub-matrix (in particular, 2-by-2) is positive semidefinite,
formula_379

and thus, when formula_380
formula_381

An formula_26 Hermitian matrix formula_1 is positive definite if it satisfies the following trace inequalities:
formula_384

Another important result is that for any formula_1 and formula_267 positive-semidefinite matrices, formula_387 This follows by writing formula_388 The matrix formula_389 is positive-semidefinite and thus has non-negative eigenvalues, whose sum, the trace, is therefore also non-negative.

===Hadamard product===
If formula_390 although formula_370 is not necessary positive semidefinite, the Hadamard product is, formula_392 (this result is often called the Schur product theorem).

Regarding the Hadamard product of two positive semidefinite matrices formula_393 formula_394 there are two notable inequalities:
* Oppenheim&#x27;s inequality: formula_395
* formula_396

===Kronecker product===
If formula_390 although formula_370 is not necessary positive semidefinite, the Kronecker product formula_399

===Frobenius product===
If formula_390 although formula_370 is not necessary positive semidefinite, the Frobenius inner product formula_402 (Lancaster–Tismenetsky, &quot;The Theory of Matrices&quot;, p. 218).

===Convexity===
The set of positive semidefinite symmetric matrices is convex. That is, if formula_1 and formula_267 are positive semidefinite, then for any formula_405 between and , formula_406 is also positive semidefinite. For any vector formula_29:
formula_408

This property guarantees that semidefinite programming problems converge to a globally optimal solution.

=== Relation with cosine ===
The positive-definiteness of a matrix formula_104 expresses that the angle formula_410 between any vector formula_29 and its image formula_412 is always formula_413

formula_414 the angle between formula_29 and formula_416

===Further properties===

# If formula_1 is a symmetric Toeplitz matrix, i.e. the entries formula_418 are given as a function of their absolute index differences: formula_419 and the &quot;strict&quot; inequality formula_420 holds, then formula_1 is &quot;strictly&quot; positive definite.
# Let formula_422 and formula_267 Hermitian. If formula_424 (resp., formula_425) then formula_426 (resp., formula_427).
# If formula_422 is real, then there is a formula_429 such that formula_430 where formula_431 is the identity matrix.
# If formula_432 denotes the leading formula_188 minor, formula_434 is the th pivot during LU decomposition.
# A matrix is negative definite if its th order leading principal minor is negative when formula_157 is odd, and positive when formula_157 is even.
# If formula_1 is a real positive definite matrix, then there exists a positive real number formula_438 such that for every vector formula_439 formula_440 
# A Hermitian matrix is positive semidefinite if and only if all of its principal minors are nonnegative. It is however not enough to consider the leading principal minors only, as is checked on the diagonal matrix with entries and 

=== Block matrices and submatrices ===
A positive formula_441 matrix may also be defined by blocks:
formula_442

where each block is formula_443 By applying the positivity condition, it immediately follows that formula_104 and formula_125 are hermitian, and formula_446

We have that formula_447 for all complex formula_7 and in particular for formula_449 Then
formula_450

A similar argument can be applied to formula_451 and thus we conclude that both formula_104 and formula_125 must be positive definite. The argument can be extended to show that any principal submatrix of formula_1 is itself positive definite.

Converse results can be proved with stronger conditions on the blocks, for instance, using the Schur complement.

=== Local extrema ===
A general quadratic form formula_455 on formula_456 real variables formula_457 can always be written as formula_2 where formula_29 is the column vector with those variables, and formula_1 is a symmetric real matrix. Therefore, the matrix being positive definite means that formula_461 has a unique minimum (zero) when formula_29 is zero, and is strictly positive for any other formula_302

More generally, a twice-differentiable real function formula_461 on formula_456 real variables has local minimum at arguments formula_457 if its gradient is zero and its Hessian (the matrix of all second derivatives) is positive semi-definite at that point. Similar statements can be made for negative definite and semi-definite matrices.

===Covariance===
In statistics, the covariance matrix of a multivariate probability distribution is always positive semi-definite; and it is positive definite unless one variable is an exact linear function of the others. Conversely, every positive semi-definite matrix is the covariance matrix of some multivariate distribution.

== Extension for non-Hermitian square matrices ==
The definition of positive definite can be generalized by designating any complex matrix formula_1 (e.g. real non-symmetric) as positive definite if formula_468 for all non-zero complex vectors formula_7 where formula_470 denotes the real part of a complex number formula_471 Only the Hermitian part formula_472 determines whether the matrix is positive definite, and is assessed in the narrower sense above. Similarly, if formula_29 and formula_1 are real, we have formula_475 for all real nonzero vectors formula_29 if and only if the symmetric part formula_477 is positive definite in the narrower sense. It is immediately clear that formula_478is insensitive to transposition of formula_48

A non-symmetric real matrix with only positive eigenvalues may have a symmetric part with negative eigenvalues, in which case it will not be positive (semi)definite. For example, the matrix formula_480 has positive eigenvalues 1 and 7, yet formula_481 with the choice formula_482.

In summary, the distinguishing feature between the real and complex case is that, a bounded positive operator on a complex Hilbert space is necessarily Hermitian, or self adjoint. The general claim can be argued using the polarization identity. That is no longer true in the real case.

== Applications ==
=== Heat conductivity matrix ===
Fourier&#x27;s law of heat conduction, giving heat flux formula_483 in terms of the temperature gradient formula_484 is written for anisotropic media as formula_485 in which formula_486 is the thermal conductivity matrix. The negative is inserted in Fourier&#x27;s law to reflect the expectation that heat will always flow from hot to cold. In other words, since the temperature gradient formula_487 always points from cold to hot, the heat flux formula_483 is expected to have a negative inner product with formula_487 so that formula_490 Substituting Fourier&#x27;s law then gives this expectation as formula_491 implying that the conductivity matrix should be positive definite. Ordinarily formula_486 should be symmetric, however it becomes nonsymmetric in the presence of a magnetic field as in a thermal Hall effect.

More generally in thermodynamics, the flow of heat and particles is a fully coupled system as described by the Onsager reciprocal relations, and the coupling matrix is required to be positive semi-definite (possibly non-symmetric) in order that entropy production be nonnegative.

<text>The Magnoliaceae () are a flowering plant family, the magnolia family, in the order Magnoliales. It consists of two genera: &quot;Magnolia&quot; and &quot;Liriodendron&quot; (tulip trees).

Unlike most angiosperms, whose flower parts are in whorls (rings), the Magnoliaceae have their stamens and pistils in spirals on a conical receptacle. This arrangement is found in some fossil plants and is believed to be a basal or early condition for angiosperms. The flowers also have parts not distinctly differentiated into sepals and petals, while angiosperms that evolved later tend to have distinctly differentiated sepals and petals. The poorly differentiated perianth parts that occupy both positions are known as tepals.

The family has about 219 species and ranges across subtropical eastern North America, Mexico and Central America, the West Indies, tropical South America, southern and eastern India, Sri Lanka, Indochina, Malesia, China, Japan, and Korea.

==Genera==

The number of genera in Magnoliaceae is a subject of debate. Up to 17 have been recognized, including &quot;Alcimandra&quot;, &quot;Lirianthe&quot;, &quot;Manglietia&quot;, &quot;Michelia&quot;, &quot;Pachylarnax&quot;, &quot;Parakmeria&quot;, &quot;Talauma&quot; and &quot;Yulania&quot;. However, many recent studies have opted to merge all genera within subfamily Magnolioideae into the genus &quot;Magnolia&quot;. Thus, Magnoliaceae would include only two extant genera, &quot;Magnolia&quot; and &quot;Liriodendron&quot;.

== Description ==

The monophyly of Magnoliaceae is supported by a number of shared morphological characters among the various genera in the family. Most have bisexual flowers (with the exception of &quot;Kmeria&quot; and some species of &quot;Magnolia&quot; section &quot;Gynopodium&quot;), showy, fragrant, radial, and with an elongated receptacle.
Leaves are alternate, simple, and sometimes lobed. The inflorescence is a solitary, showy flower with indistinguishable petals and sepals. Sepals range from six to many; stamens are numerous and feature short which are poorly differentiated from the anthers. Carpels are usually numerous, distinct, and on an elongated receptacle or torus. The fruit is an aggregate fruit (etaerio) of follicles which usually become closely appressed as they mature and open along the abaxial surface. Seeds have a fleshy coat, aril, and color that ranges from red to orange (except &quot;Liriodendron&quot;). Magnoliaceae flowers are beetle pollinated, except for &quot;Liriodendron&quot;, which is bee pollinated. The carpels of&quot; Magnolia&quot; flowers are especially thick to avoid damage by beetles that land, crawl, and feast on them. The seeds of Magnolioideae are bird-dispersed, while the seeds of &quot;Liriodendron&quot; are wind-dispersed.

== Biogeography ==
Due to its great age, the geographical distribution of the Magnoliaceae has become disjunct or fragmented as a result of major geologic events such as ice ages, continental drift, and mountain formation. This distribution pattern has isolated some species, while keeping others in close contact.
Extant species of the Magnoliaceae are widely distributed in temperate and tropical Asia from the Himalayas to Japan and southwest through Malaysia and New Guinea. Asia is home to about two-thirds of the species in Magnoliaceae, with the remainder of the family spread across the Americas with temperate species extending into southern Canada and tropical elements extending into Brazil and the West Indies.

== Systematics ==

=== Foundational Taxonomic and Systematics Research (18th-19th century) ===
The earliest botanical description of the Magnoliaceae as a family is in Antonii Laurentii de Jussieu&#x27;s &quot;Genera Plantarum&quot;, which describes eight genera included within the family (&quot;Euryandra&quot;, &quot;Drymis&quot;, Illicium, &quot;Michelia&quot;, &quot;Magnolia&quot;, &quot;Talauma, Liriodendrum&quot;, and &quot;Mayna&quot;) as well as four genera closely related to the family (&quot;Dillenia&quot;, &quot;Curatella&quot;, &quot;Ochna&quot;, and &quot;Quassia&quot;). Bentham and Hooker&#x27;s &quot;Genera Plantarum&quot;, almost a century later, sorts the family&#x27;s genera into three tribes: the Wintereae, including the genera &quot;Drimys&quot; and &quot;Illicium&quot;, the Magnolieae, including the genera &quot;Talauma, Magnolia, Manglieta, Michelia&quot;, and &quot;Liriodendron&quot;, and the Schizandreae, including the genera &quot;Schizandra&quot; and &quot;Kadsura&quot;. In his following work &quot;Adansonia&quot;, Baillon recognizes Bentham and Hooker&#x27;s changes and additions but proposes an alternative taxonomy where he sets aside the &quot;Tulipier&quot; genus and include all remaining genera under one Magnolieae tribe. From this basic separation, scholars have continued to debate the systematics of the family.

=== Modern Systematics Research (20th-21st century) ===
Dandy&#x27;s taxonomic proposal in 1927 sets aside the genus &quot;Liriodendron&quot; as a part of the subfamily Liriodendreae and includes Bentham and Hooker&#x27;s four genera in addition to four more (&quot;Kmeria, Pachylarnax, Alcimandra&quot;, and &quot;Elmerrillia&quot;) within the Magnolieae tribe. Dandy&#x27;s model with eleven genera was widely accepted until molecular evidence brought it into question (Figlar, 2019). Qiu et al. analyzed molecular data in 1995 to investigate the divergences within and between East Asian and East North American species of &quot;Magnolia&quot;, presenting molecular evidence which shows that Dandy&#x27;s section &quot;Rytidospermum&quot; is not monophyletic. Azuma et al. employ both molecular phylogeny and parsimonious mapping of the chemistry of floral scents in 1999 to propose a phylogenetic tree where, unlike Dandy&#x27;s taxonomy, they include &quot;Michelia&quot; species within the &quot;Magnolia&quot; genus as a sister group to the subgenus &quot;Yulania&quot; and also find that the section &quot;Rytidospermum&quot; is not monophyletic, placing some of its members in a clade with the section &quot;Oyama&quot;.

The most recent research on the family continues the debate over the genera of the family. Wang et al.&#x27;s study analyzes complete chloroplast genome sequences of 86 species in the Magnoliaceae and supports a phylogeny with fifteen major clades, two subfamilies, two genera, and fifteen sections, maintaining &quot;Magnolia&quot;&#x27;s classification as one monophyletic genus. Dong et al. also place &quot;Magnolia&quot; as the sole genus of the subfamily Magnolioideae made up of fifteen sections. However, Yang et al. and Zhao et al. work with phylogenies of the Magnoliaceae that recognize several genera in the Magnolioideae.

=== Consensus and Debates Today ===
Although phylogenetic trees of the Magnoliaceae still include anywhere from 2 to 17 genera, the broad generic concept (where one genus, &quot;Magnolia&quot;, is in the Magnolioideae) is largely accepted as a practical construction upheld by molecular and morphological evidence. Even as debates over rank persist, monophyletic groups are largely established with opportunities for further research into endangered and extinct species. The family&#x27;s place as early angiosperms means that research into its taxonomy and evolutionary history contributes to our broader understanding of the evolution of plant life.

The development of DNA sequencing at the end of the 20th century had a profound impact on the research of phylogenetic relationships within the family. The employment of &quot;ndh&quot;F and cpDNA sequences has refuted many of the traditionally accepted phylogenetic relationships within the Magnoliaceae. For example, the genera &quot;Magnolia&quot; and &quot;Michelia&quot; were shown to be paraphyletic when the remaining four genera of the Magnolioideae are split out. In fact, even many of the subgenera (&quot;Magnolia&quot; subg. &quot;Magnolia&quot;, &quot;Magnolia&quot; subg. &quot;Talauma&quot;) have been found to be paraphyletic. Although no completely resolved phylogeny for the family has yet been determined, these technological advances have allowed systematists to broadly circumscribe major lineages.

== Economic significance ==

As a whole, the Magnoliaceae are not an economically significant family. With the exception of ornamental cultivation, the economic significance of magnolias is generally confined to the use of wood from certain timber species and the use of bark and flowers from several species believed to possess medicinal qualities. The wood of the American tuliptree, &quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot; and the wood of the cucumbertree magnolia, &quot;Magnolia acuminata&quot;, and, to a lesser degree, that of the Frasier magnolia, &quot;Magnolia fraseri&quot;, are harvested and marketed collectively as &quot;yellow poplar.&quot; This is a lightweight and exceptionally fine-grained wood, lending itself to precision woodworking for purposes such as pipe organ building.

Magnolias have a rich cultural tradition in China, where references to their healing qualities go back thousands of years. The Chinese have long used the bark of &quot;Magnolia officinalis&quot;, a magnolia native to the mountains of China with large leaves and fragrant white flowers, as a remedy for cramps, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and indigestion. Certain magnolia flowers, such as the buds of &quot;Magnolia liliiflora&quot;, have been used to treat chronic respiratory and sinus infections and lung congestion. Recently, magnolia bark has become incorporated into alternative medicine in the west, where tablets made from the bark of &quot;M. officinalis&quot; have been marketed as an aid for anxiety, allergies, asthma, and weight loss. Compounds found in magnolia bark might have antibacterial and antifungal properties, but no large-scale study on the health effects of magnolia bark or flowers has yet been conducted.

<text>Cannoli are Sicilian pastries consisting of a tube-shaped shell of fried pastry dough, filled with a sweet, creamy filling containing ricotta cheese. Their size ranges from . They have since spread to mainland Italy, where they are known as ().

In culinary traditions across Sicily, regional variations in cannoli fillings reflect local preferences and ingredient availability. In Palermo, cannoli are decorated with candied orange zest, adding a citrusy sweetness to the filling. In Catania, chopped pistachios are favored, adding a distinctive nutty flavor and texture. Ramacca is known for its purple artichokes, which also feature as filling in some cannoli recipes.

==Etymology==
Italian and Sicilian is originally a diminutive noun meaning &#x27;little tube&#x27;, from , &#x27;cane&#x27; or &#x27;tube&#x27;.

==History==

Some food historians place the origins of cannoli in 827–1091 in Caltanissetta, Sicily, by the concubines of princes looking to capture their attention. This period marks the Arab rule of the island, known then as the Emirate of Sicily, giving rise to the theory that the etymology stemmed from the Arabic word &quot;qanawāt&quot;, &#x27;tubes&#x27;, in reference to their tube-shaped shells. During this time, the Arabs influenced Sicilian baking with the introduction of candied fruits, pistachios, and cinnamon. They also introduced the technique of combining nuts and fruits with sugar and honey.

Gaetano Basile claims that cannoli come from the Palermo and Messina areas and were historically prepared as a treat during Carnival season, possibly as a fertility symbol. The dessert eventually became a year-round staple in Sicily.

What is certain is, as Salvatore Farina explains, that, &quot;&quot;cannolo&quot; is a word of Latin origin – &quot;canneolus&quot; – and means the joint of a reed or cane, the artisan instrument used to roll the dough that was fried to make the characteristic shell, later filled with ricotta cream.&quot; Farina continues, &quot;Probably, long ago, in the wild days of the Saturnali and the old style Carnival, street sellers prepared cannoli in the noisy and crowded public squares, filling the shell with a ricotta and honey cream. This is a confection that comes in natural portions, ideal for eating outside just as one does today with an ice cream cone.&quot;

Some similar desserts in Middle Eastern tradition include &quot;Zaynab&#x27;s fingers&quot; (), which are filled with nuts, and &quot;qanawāt&quot; (), deep-fried dough tubes filled with various sweets, which were a popular pastry.
