<text>The Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre was the murder of seven members and associates of Chicago&#x27;s North Side Gang on Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day 1929. The men were gathered at a Lincoln Park, Chicago garage on the morning of February 14, 1929. They were lined up against a wall and shot by four unknown assailants, two of whom were disguised as police officers.

The murders resulted from the competition for control of organized crime in the city during Prohibition between the largely Irish North Siders, headed by George &quot;Bugs&quot; Moran, and their largely Italian Chicago Outfit rivals led by Al Capone. The perpetrators have never been conclusively identified, but former members of the Egan&#x27;s Rats gang working for Capone are suspected of involvement; others have said that members of the Chicago Police Department who allegedly wanted revenge for the killing of a police officer&#x27;s son played a part.

== The massacre ==
At 10:30 in the morning on Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day, Thursday, February 14, 1929, seven men were murdered at the garage at 2122 North Clark Street, in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago&#x27;s North Side. They were shot by four men using weapons that included two Thompson submachine guns. Two of the shooters were wearing police uniforms, while the others wore suits, ties, overcoats, and hats. Witnesses saw the men in police uniforms leading the other men at gunpoint out of the garage after the shooting.

The victims included five members of George &quot;Bugs&quot; Moran&#x27;s North Side Gang. Moran&#x27;s second in command and brother-in-law Albert Kachellek (&quot;alias&quot; James Clark) was killed along with Adam Heyer, the gang&#x27;s bookkeeper and business manager; Albert Weinshank, who managed several cleaning and dyeing operations for Moran; and gang enforcers Frank Gusenberg and Peter Gusenberg. Two associates were also shot: Reinhardt H. Schwimmer, a former optician turned gambler and gang associate; and John May, an occasional mechanic for the Moran gang.

Chicago police officers arrived at the scene to find that victim Frank Gusenberg was still alive, despite having sustained 14 bullet wounds. He was taken to the hospital, where doctors stabilized him for a short time and police tried to question him. When the police asked him who did it, he reportedly replied, &quot;I won&#x27;t talk. For God&#x27;s sake get me to a hospital.&quot; He died three hours later.

The massacre was an attempt to eliminate Bugs Moran, head of the North Side Gang. Al Capone, who was at his Florida home at the time, was widely assumed to have been responsible for ordering the massacre. The impetus for the plan may have been the North Side Gang&#x27;s hijacking of some expensive whiskey being illegally smuggled by Capone&#x27;s gang from Canada across the Detroit River.

Moran was the last survivor of the North Side gunmen; his succession had come about because his similarly aggressive predecessors, Hymie Weiss and Vincent Drucci, had been killed in the violence that followed the murder of their original leader, Dean O&#x27;Banion.

Several factors contributed to the timing of the plan to kill Moran. Moran and Capone had been vying for control of the lucrative Chicago bootlegging trade. Moran had also been muscling in on a Capone-run dog track in the Chicago suburbs, and he had taken over several saloons that were run by Capone, insisting that they were in his territory. Earlier in the year, North Sider Frank Gusenberg and his brother Peter unsuccessfully attempted to murder Jack McGurn. The North Side Gang was complicit in the murders of Pasqualino &quot;Patsy&quot; Lolordo and Antonio &quot;The Scourge&quot; Lombardo. Both had been presidents of the Unione Siciliana, the local Mafia, and close associates of Capone.

The plan was to lure Moran to the SMC Cartage warehouse on North Clark Street on February 14, 1929, to kill him and perhaps two or three of his lieutenants. It is usually assumed that the North Siders were lured to the garage with the promise of a stolen, cut-rate shipment of whiskey, supplied by Detroit&#x27;s Purple Gang, which was associated with Capone. The Gusenberg brothers were supposed to drive two empty trucks to Detroit that day to pick up two loads of stolen Canadian whisky.

All of the victims were dressed in their best clothes, with the exception of John May, as was customary for the North Siders and other gangsters at the time.
 Most of the Moran gang arrived at the warehouse by approximately 10:30 a.m., but Moran was not there, having left his Parkway Hotel apartment late. He and fellow gang member Ted Newberry were approaching the rear of the warehouse from a side street when they saw a police car nearing the building. They immediately turned and retraced their steps, going to a nearby coffee shop. They encountered gang member Henry Gusenberg on the street and warned him, so he too turned back. North Side Gang member Willie Marks also spotted the police car on his way to the garage and ducked into a doorway and jotted down the license number before leaving the neighborhood.

Capone&#x27;s lookouts likely mistook one of Moran&#x27;s men, probably Albert Weinshank, who was the same height and build, for Moran himself. The physical similarity between the two men was enhanced by their dress that morning; both happened to be wearing the same color overcoats and hats.

Witnesses outside the garage saw a Cadillac sedan stop in front of the garage. Four men emerged and walked inside, two of them dressed in police uniform. The two fake police officers carried shotguns and entered the rear portion of the garage, where they found members of Moran&#x27;s gang and associates Reinhart Schwimmer and John May, who was fixing one of the trucks. The fake policemen then ordered the men to line up against the wall, then signaled to the pair in civilian clothes who had accompanied them. Two of the killers opened fire with Thompson sub-machine guns, one with a 20-round box magazine and the other a 50-round drum. They were thorough, spraying their victims left and right, even continuing to fire after all seven had hit the floor. Two shotgun blasts afterward all but obliterated the faces of John May and James Clark, according to the coroner&#x27;s report.

To give the appearance that everything was under control, the men in street clothes came out with their hands up, prodded by the two uniformed policemen. Inside the garage, the only survivors in the warehouse were May&#x27;s dog &quot;Highball&quot; and Frank Gusenberg, despite 14 bullet wounds. He was still conscious, but he died three hours later, refusing to identify the killers.

=== Victims ===
* Peter Gusenberg, a front-line enforcer for the Moran organizations 
* Frank Gusenberg, the brother of Peter Gusenberg, also an enforcer
* Albert Kachellek (alias &quot;James Clark&quot;), Moran&#x27;s second in command
* Adam Heyer, the bookkeeper and business manager of the Moran gang
* Reinhardt Schwimmer, an optometrist who had abandoned his practice to gamble on horse racing and associate with the gang
* Albert Weinshank, who managed several cleaning and dyeing operations for Moran; his resemblance to Moran is allegedly what set the massacre in motion before Moran arrived, including the clothes that he was wearing
* John May, an occasional car mechanic for the Moran gang

== Investigation ==
The Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre set off a public outcry which posed a problem for all bosses of the National Crime Syndicate. Within days, Capone received a summons to testify before a Chicago grand jury on charges of federal Prohibition violations, but he said he was too unwell to attend.

It was common knowledge that Moran was hijacking Capone&#x27;s Detroit-based liquor shipments, and police focused their attention on Detroit&#x27;s predominantly Jewish Purple Gang. Landladies Mrs. Doody and Mrs. Orvidson had taken in three men as roomers ten days before the massacre, and their rooming houses were directly across the street from the North Clark Street garage. They picked out mugshots of Purple Gang members George Lewis, Eddie Fletcher, Phil Keywell, and his younger brother Harry, but they later wavered in their identification. The police questioned and cleared Fletcher, Lewis, and Harry Keywell. Nevertheless, the Keywell brothers (and by extension the Purple Gang) remained associated with the crime in the years that followed. Many also believed that the police were involved, which may have been the intention of the killers.

On February 22, police were called to the scene of a garage fire on Wood Street where they found a 1927 Cadillac sedan disassembled and partially burned, and determined that the killers had used the car. They traced the engine number to a Michigan Avenue dealer who had sold the car to a James Morton of Los Angeles. The garage had been rented by a man calling himself Frank Rogers, who gave his address as 1859 West North Avenue. This was the address of the Circus Café operated by Claude Maddox, a former St. Louis gangster with ties to the Capone gang, the Purple Gang, and the St. Louis gang, Egan&#x27;s Rats.

Police could not turn up any information about persons named James Morton or Frank Rogers, but they had a definite lead on one of the killers. Just minutes before the killings, a truck driver named Elmer Lewis had turned a corner a block away from 2122 North Clark and sideswiped a police car. He told police that he stopped immediately but was waved away by the uniformed driver, who was missing a front tooth. Board of Education President H. Wallace Caldwell had witnessed the accident, and he gave the same description of the driver. Police were confident that they were describing Fred Burke, a former member of Egan&#x27;s Rats. Burke and a close companion named James Ray were known to wear police uniforms whenever on a robbery spree. Burke was also a fugitive, under indictment for robbery and murder in Ohio. Police also suggested that Joseph Lolordo could have been one of the killers because of his brother Pasqualino&#x27;s recent murder by the North Side Gang.

Police then announced that they suspected Capone gunmen John Scalise and Albert Anselmi, as well as Jack McGurn and Frank Rio, a Capone bodyguard. Police eventually charged McGurn and Scalise with the massacre. Capone murdered Scalise, Anselmi, and Joseph &quot;Hop Toad&quot; Giunta in May 1929 after he learned about their plan to kill him. The police dropped the murder charges against Jack McGurn because of a lack of evidence, and he was just charged with a violation of the Mann Act; he took his girlfriend Louise Rolfe across state lines to marry.

The case stagnated until December 14, 1929, when the Berrien County, Michigan Sheriff&#x27;s Department raided the St. Joseph, Michigan bungalow of &quot;Frederick Dane&quot;, the registered owner of a vehicle driven by Fred &quot;Killer&quot; Burke. Burke had been drinking that night, then rear-ended another vehicle and drove off. Patrolman Charles Skelly pursued, finally forcing him off the road. Skelly hopped onto the running board of Burke&#x27;s car, but he was shot three times and died of his wounds that night. The car was found wrecked and abandoned just outside St. Joseph and traced to Fred Dane. By this time, police photos confirmed that Dane was in fact Fred Burke, wanted by the Chicago police for his participation in the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre.

Police raided Burke&#x27;s bungalow and found a large trunk containing a bullet-proof vest, almost $320,000 in bonds recently stolen from a Wisconsin bank, two Thompson submachine guns, pistols, two shotguns, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. St. Joseph authorities immediately notified the Chicago police, who requested both machine guns. They used the new science of forensic ballistics to identify both weapons as those used in the massacre. They also discovered that one of them had also been used to murder New York mobster Frankie Yale a year and a half earlier. Unfortunately, no further concrete evidence surfaced in the massacre case.

Burke was captured over a year later on a Missouri farm. The case against him was strongest in connection to the murder of Officer Skelly, so he was tried in Michigan and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment. He died in prison in 1940.

== Bolton revelations ==
On January 8, 1935, FBI agents surrounded a Chicago apartment building at 3920 North Pine Grove looking for the remaining members of the Barker Gang. A brief shootout erupted, resulting in the death of bank robber Russell Gibson. Taken into custody were Doc Barker, Byron Bolton, and two women. Bolton was a Navy machine-gunner and associate of Egan&#x27;s Rats, and he had been the valet of Chicago hit man Fred Goetz. Bolton was privy to many of the Barker Gang&#x27;s crimes and pinpointed the Florida hideout of Ma Barker and Freddie Barker, both of whom were killed in a shootout with the FBI a week later. Bolton said he took part in the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre with Goetz, Fred Burke, and several others.

The FBI had no jurisdiction in a state murder case, so they kept Bolton&#x27;s revelations confidential until the &quot;Chicago American&quot; newspaper reported a second-hand version of his confession. The newspaper declared that the crime had been &quot;solved&quot;, despite being stonewalled by J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI, who did not want any part of the massacre case. Garbled versions of Bolton&#x27;s story went out in the national media. Bolton, it was reported, said that the plan to murder Bugs Moran had been plotted in October or November 1928 at a Couderay, Wisconsin resort owned by Fred Goetz. Present at this meeting were Goetz, Al Capone, Frank Nitti, Fred Burke, Gus Winkler, Louis Campagna, Daniel Serritella, William Pacelli, and Bolton. The men stayed two or three weeks, hunting and fishing when they were not planning the murder of their enemies.

Bolton said that he and Jimmy Moran were charged with watching the S.M.C. Cartage garage and phoning the signal to the killers at the Circus Café when Bugs Moran arrived at the meeting. Police had found a letter addressed to Bolton in the lookout nest (and possibly a vial of prescription medicine). Bolton guessed that the actual killers had been Burke, Winkeler, Goetz, Bob Carey, Raymond &quot;Crane Neck&quot; Nugent, and Claude Maddox (four shooters and two getaway drivers). Bolton gave an account of the massacre different from the one generally told by historians. He said that he saw only &quot;plainclothes&quot; men exit the Cadillac and go into the garage. This indicates that a second car was used by the killers. George Brichet said he saw at least two uniformed men exiting a car in the alley and entering the garage through its rear doors. A Peerless Motor Company sedan had been found near a Maywood house owned by Claude Maddox in the days after the massacre, and in one of the pockets was an address book belonging to victim Albert Weinshank. Bolton said that he had mistaken one of Moran&#x27;s men to be Moran, after which he telephoned the signal to the Circus Café. The killers had expected to kill Moran and two or three of his men, but they were unexpectedly confronted with seven men; they simply decided to kill them all and get out fast. Bolton said that Capone was furious with him for his mistake and the resulting police pressure and threatened to kill him, only to be dissuaded by Fred Goetz.

His claims were corroborated by Gus Winkeler&#x27;s widow Georgette in an official FBI statement and in her memoirs, which were published in a four-part series in a true detective magazine during the winter of 1935–36. She revealed that her husband and his friends had formed a special crew used by Capone for high-risk jobs. The mob boss was said to have trusted them implicitly and nicknamed them the &quot;American Boys&quot;. Bolton&#x27;s statements were also backed up by William Drury, a Chicago detective who had stayed on the massacre case long after everyone else had given up. Bank robber Alvin Karpis later said to have heard secondhand from Ray Nugent about the massacre and that the &quot;American Boys&quot; were paid a collective salary of $2,000 a week plus bonuses. Karpis also said that Capone had told him while they were in Alcatraz together that Goetz had been the actual planner of the massacre.

Despite Byron Bolton&#x27;s statements, no action was taken by the FBI. All the men whom he named were dead by 1935, with the exception of Burke and Maddox. Bank robber Harvey Bailey complained in his 1973 autobiography that he and Fred Burke had been drinking beer in Calumet City, Illinois at the time of the massacre, and the resulting heat forced them to abandon their bank robbing ventures. Historians are still divided on whether or not the &quot;American Boys&quot; committed the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre.

== Other suspects ==
Many mobsters have been named as part of the Valentine&#x27;s Day hit team. Two prime suspects are Cosa Nostra hit men John Scalise and Albert Anselmi. In the days after the massacre, Scalise was heard to brag, &quot;I am the most powerful man in Chicago.&quot; Unione Siciliana president Joseph Guinta had recently elevated him to the position of the Unione&#x27;s vice-president. Nevertheless, Scalise, Anselmi, and Guinta were found dead on a lonely road near Hammond, Indiana on May 8, 1929. Gangland lore has it that Capone had discovered that the pair were planning to betray him. Legend states that Capone produced a baseball bat at the climax of a dinner party thrown in their honor and beat the trio to death.

In 1995 Chicago criminologist Arthur Bilek, who had researched the massacre through FBI files and court transcripts for 30 years, named the participants in the massacre to have been Capone henchmen &quot;Machine Gun&quot; Jack McGurn, who assembled the murder team that included lookouts Byron Bolton, Jimmy Moran (no relation to Bugs) and Jimmy McCryssen. Their job was to watch the garage and alert Tony Accardo and the other triggermen—Fred Burke, Gus Winkler, Freddie Goetz and Robert Carey—when Bugs Moran appeared at the site. Another team member, according to Bilek, was Claude &quot;Screwy&quot; Maddox, who procured the killers&#x27; transportation—a car resembling those used by police. With the stage set, Capone and McGurn established alibis: Capone going to Florida; McGurn checked into a hotel with his wife, Louise Rolfe. His claims were backed up by the former FBI agent William Roemer, who had heard claims of Tony Accardo also being involved as one of the shooters on several occasions by Murray &quot;The Camel&quot; Humphreys through a microphone planted in the Chicago Tailor shop in 1959.

== Murder weapons ==
Police tested the two Thompson submachine guns (serial numbers 2347 and 7580) found in Fred Burke&#x27;s Michigan bungalow and determined that both had been used in the massacre. One of them had also been used in the murder of Brooklyn mob boss Frankie Yale, which confirmed the New York Police Department&#x27;s long-held theory that Burke had been responsible for Yale&#x27;s death.

Les Farmer, a deputy sheriff in Marion, Illinois purchased gun number 2347 on November 12, 1924. Marion and the surrounding area were overrun by the warring bootleg factions of the Shelton Brothers Gang and Charlie Birger. Farmer had ties with Egan&#x27;s Rats, based 100 miles away in St. Louis, and the weapon had wound up in Fred Burke&#x27;s possession by 1927. It is possible that he used this same gun in Detroit&#x27;s Milaflores Massacre on March 28, 1927. Chicago sporting goods owner Peter von Frantzius sold gun number 7580 to a Victor Thompson, also known as Frank V. Thompson, but it wound up with James &quot;Bozo&quot; Shupe, a small-time hood from Chicago&#x27;s West Side who had ties to various members of Capone&#x27;s outfit. Both guns are currently in the possession of the Berrien County, Michigan Sheriff&#x27;s Department.

== Legacy ==
The garage at 2122 N. Clark Street was demolished in 1967, and the site is now a parking lot for a nursing home. The bricks of the north wall against which the victims were shot were purchased by a Canadian businessman. For many years, they were displayed in various crime-related novelty displays. Many of them were later sold individually, and the remainder are now owned by the Mob Museum in Las Vegas.

<text>Ayodhya (; ) is a city situated on the banks of the Saryu river in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is the administrative headquarters of the Ayodhya district as well as the Ayodhya division of Uttar Pradesh, India. Ayodhya became the top tourist destination of Uttar Pradesh with 110 million visitors in the first half of 2024, surpassing Varanasi.

Ayodhya was historically known as Saketa until renamed Ayodhya, by Skandagupta. The early Buddhist and Jain canonical texts mention that the religious leaders Gautama Buddha and Mahavira visited and lived in the city. The Jain texts also describe it as the birthplace of five tirthankaras namely, Rishabhanatha, Ajitanatha, Abhinandananatha, Sumatinatha and Anantanatha, and associate it with the legendary Bharata Chakravarti. From the Gupta period onwards, several sources mention Ayodhya and Saketa as the name of the same city.

The legendary city of Ayodhya, popularly identified as the present-day Ayodhya, is identified in the epic &quot;Ramayana&quot; and its many versions as the birthplace of the Hindu deity Rama of Kosala and is hence regarded as the first of the seven most important pilgrimage sites for Hindus. The Ayodhya dispute was centred on the Babri mosque, built 1528–29 under the Mughal emperor Babur and said to have been built on top of a Hindu temple that stood at the birth spot of Rama. In 1992 a Hindu mob demolished the mosque, provoking riots throughout the country. In 2019, the Supreme Court of India announced the final verdict that the land belonged to the government based on tax records; It further ordered the land to be handed over to a trust to build the Ram Mandir; which was consecrated in January 2024. It also ordered the government to give an alternate five acre tract of land to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board to build the mosque.

== Etymology and names ==
The word &quot;Ayodhya&quot; is a regularly formed derivation of the Sanskrit verb &quot;yudh&quot;, &quot;to fight, or wage war&quot;. &quot;Yodhya&quot; is the future passive participle, meaning &quot;to be fought&quot;; the initial &quot;a&quot; is the negative prefix; the whole, therefore, means &quot;not to be fought&quot; or, more idiomatically in English, &quot;invincible&quot;. This meaning is attested by the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot;, which uses it to refer to the unconquerable city of gods. The ninth century Jain poem &quot;Adi Purana&quot; also states that Ayodhya &quot;does not exist by name alone but by the merit&quot; of being unconquerable by enemies. &quot;Satyopakhyana&quot; interprets the word differently, stating that it means &quot;that which cannot be conquered by sins&quot; (instead of enemies).

&quot;Saketa&quot; is the older name for the city, attested in Sanskrit, Jain, Buddhist, Greek and Chinese sources. According to Vaman Shivram Apte, the word &quot;Saketa&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit words &quot;Saha&quot; (with) and &quot;Aketen&quot; (houses or buildings). The &quot;Adi Purana&quot; states that Ayodhya is called Saketa &quot;because of its magnificent buildings which had significant banners as their arms&quot;. According to Hans T. Bakker, the word may be derived from the roots &quot;sa&quot; and &quot;ketu&quot; (&quot;with banner&quot;); the variant name &quot;saketu&quot; is attested in the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;.

The older name in English was &quot;Oudh&quot; or &quot;Oude&quot;, and the princely state it was the capital of until 1856 is still known as Oudh State.

Ayodhya was stated to be the capital of the ancient Kosala kingdom in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. Hence it was also referred to as &quot;Kosala&quot;. The &quot;Adi Purana&quot; states that Ayodhya is famous as &quot;su-kośala&quot; &quot;because of its prosperity and good skill&quot;.

The cities of Ayutthaya (Thailand), and Yogyakarta (Indonesia), are named after Ayodhya.

== History ==


Ancient Indian Sanskrit-language epics, such as the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; mention a legendary city called Ayodhya, which was the capital of the legendary Ikshvaku kings of Kosala, including Rama. Neither these texts, nor the earlier Sanskrit texts such as the Vedas, mention a city called Saketa. Non-religious, non-legendary ancient Sanskrit texts, such as Panini&#x27;s &quot;Ashtadhyayi&quot; and Patanjali&#x27;s commentary on it, do mention Saketa. The later Buddhist text &quot;Mahavastu&quot; describes Saketa as the seat of the Ikshvaku king Sujata, whose descendants established the Shakya capital Kapilavastu.

The earliest of the Buddhist Pali-language texts and the Jain Prakrit-language texts mention a city called Saketa (Sageya or Saeya in Prakrit) as an important city of the Kosala mahajanapada. Topographical indications in both Buddhist and Jain texts suggest that Saketa is the same as the present-day Ayodhya. For example, according to the &quot;Samyutta Nikaya&quot; and the &quot;Vinaya Pitaka&quot;, Saketa was located at a distance of six &quot;yojana&quot;s from Shravasti. The &quot;Vinaya Pitaka&quot; mentions that a big river was located between the two cities, and the &quot;Sutta Nipata&quot; mentions Saketa as the first halting place on the southward road from Shravasti to Pratishthana.

Fourth century onwards, multiple texts, including Kalidasa&#x27;s &quot;Raghuvamsha&quot;, mention Ayodhya as another name for Saketa. The later Jain canonical text &quot;Jambudvipa-Pannati&quot; describes a city called Viniya (or Vinita) as the birthplace of Lord Rishabhanatha, and associates this city with Bharata Chakravartin; the &quot;Kalpa-Sutra&quot; describes Ikkhagabhumi as the birthplace of Rishabhadev. The index on the Jain text &quot;Paumachariya&quot; clarifies that Aojjha (Aodhya), Kosala-puri (&quot;Kosala city&quot;), Viniya, and Saeya (Saketa) are synonyms. The post-Canonical Jain texts also mention &quot;Aojjha&quot;; for example, the &quot;Avassagacurni&quot; describes it as the principal city of Kosala, while the &quot;Avassaganijjutti&quot; names it as the capital of Sagara Chakravartin. The &quot;Avassaganijjutti&quot; implies that Viniya (&quot;Vinia&quot;), Kosalapuri (&quot;Kosalapura&quot;), and Ikkhagabhumi were distinct cities, naming them as the capitals of Abhinamdana, Sumai, and Usabha respectively. Abhayadeva&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Thana Sutta&quot;, another post-canonical text, identifies Saketa, Ayodhya, and Vinita as one city.

According to one theory, the legendary Ayodhya city is the same as the historical city of Saketa and the present-day Ayodhya. According to another theory, the legendary Ayodhya is a mythical city, and the name &quot;Ayodhya&quot; came to be used for the Saketa (present-day Ayodhya) only around the fourth century, when a Gupta emperor (probably Skandagupta) moved his capital to Saketa, and renamed it to Ayodhya after the legendary city. Alternative, but less likely, theories state that Saketa and Ayodhya were two adjoining cities, or that Ayodhya was a locality within the Saketa city.

=== As Saketa ===
Archaeological and literary evidence suggests that the site of present-day Ayodhya had developed into an urban settlement by the fifth or sixth-century BC. The site is identified as the location of the ancient Saketa city, which probably emerged as a marketplace located at the junction of the two important roads, the Shravasti-Pratishthana north–south road, and the Rajagriha-Varanasi-Shravasti-Taxila east–west road. Ancient Buddhist texts, such as &quot;Samyutta Nikaya&quot;, state that Saketa was located in the Kosala kingdom ruled by Prasenajit (or Pasenadi; c. sixth–5th century BC), whose capital was located at Shravasti. The later Buddhist commentary &quot;Dhammapada-atthakatha&quot; states that the Saketa town was established by merchant Dhananjaya (the father of Visakha), on the suggestion of king Prasenajit. The &quot;Digha Nikaya&quot; describes it as one of the six large cities of India. The early Buddhist canonical texts mention Shravasti as the capital of Kosala, but the later texts, such as the Jain texts &quot;Nayadhammakahao&quot; and &quot;Pannavana Suttam&quot;, and the Buddhist Jatakas, mention Saketa as the capital of Kosala.

As a busy town frequented by travellers, it appears to have become important for preachers such as Gautama Buddha and Mahavira. The &quot;Samyutta Nikaya&quot; and &quot;Anguttara Nikaya&quot; mention that Buddha resided at Saketa at times. The early Jain canonical texts (such as &quot;Antagada-dasao&quot;, &quot;Anuttarovavaiya-dasao&quot;, and &quot;Vivagasuya&quot;) state that Mahavira visited Saketa; &quot;Nayadhammakahao&quot; states that Parshvanatha also visited Saketa. The Jain texts, both canonical and post-canonical, describe Ayodhya as the location of various shrines, such as those of snake, yaksha Pasamiya, Muni Suvratasvamin, and Surappia.

It is not clear what happened to Saketa after Kosala was conquered by the Magadha emperor Ajatashatru around fifth century BC. There is lack of historical sources about the city&#x27;s situation for the next few centuries: it is possible that the city remained a commercial centre of secondary importance, but did not grow into a political centre of Magadha, whose capital was located at Pataliputra. Several Buddhist buildings may have been constructed in the town during the rule of the Maurya emperor Ashoka in the third century BC: these buildings were probably located on the present-day human-made mounds in Ayodhya. Excavations at Ayodhya have resulted in the discovery of a large brick wall, identified as a fortification wall by archaeologist B. B. Lal. This wall probably erected in the last quarter of the third-century BC.

After the decline of the Maurya empire, Saketa appears to have come under the rule of Pushyamitra Shunga. The first century BC inscription of Dhanadeva suggests that he appointed a governor there. The &quot;Yuga Purana&quot; mentions Saketa as the residence of a governor, and describes it as being attacked by a combined force of Greeks, Mathuras, and Panchalas. Patanjali&#x27;s commentary on Panini also refers to the Greek siege of Saketa.

Later, Saketa appears to have become part of a small, independent kingdom. The &quot;Yuga Purana&quot; states that Saketa was ruled by seven powerful kings after the retreat of the Greeks. The &quot;Vayu Purana&quot; and the &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot; also state that seven powerful kings ruled in the capital of Kosala. The historicity of these kings is attested by the discovery of the coins of the Deva dynasty kings, including Dhanadeva, whose inscription describes him as the king of Kosala (&quot;Kosaladhipati&quot;). As the capital of Kosala, Saketa probably eclipsed Shravasti in importance during this period. The east–west route connecting Pataliputra to Taxila, which earlier passed through Saketa and Shravasti, appears to have shifted southwards during this period, now passing through Saketa, Ahichhatra and Kanyakubja.

After the Deva kings, Saketa appears to have been ruled by the Datta, Kushan, and Mitra kings, although the chronological order of their rule is uncertain. Bakker theorises that the Dattas succeeded the Deva kings in the mid-1st century AD, and their kingdom was annexed to the Kushan Empire by Kanishka. The Tibetan text &quot;Annals of Li Country&quot; (c. 11th century) mentions that an alliance of king Vijayakirti of Khotan, king Kanika, the king of Gu-zan, and the king of Li, marched to India and captured the So-ked city. During this invasion, Vijayakirti took several Buddhist relics from Saketa, and placed them in the stupa of Phru-no. If Kanika is identified as Kanishka, and So-ked as Saketa, it appears that the invasion of Kushans and their allies led to the destruction of the Buddhist sites at Saketa.

Nevertheless, Saketa appears to have remained a prosperous town during the Kushan rule. The second century geographer Ptolemy mentions a metropolis &quot;Sageda&quot; or &quot;Sagoda&quot;, which has been identified with Saketa. The earliest inscription that mentions Saketa as a place name is dated to the late Kushan period: it was found on the pedestal of a Buddha image in Shravasti, and records the gift of the image by Sihadeva of Saketa. Before or after the Kushans, Saketa appears to have been ruled by a dynasty of kings whose names end in &quot;-mitra&quot;, and whose coins have been found at Ayodhya. They may have been members of a local dynasty that was distinct from the Mitra dynasty of Mathura. These kings are attested only by their coinage: Sangha-mitra, Vijaya-mitra, Satya-mitra, Deva-mitra, and Arya-mitra; coins of Kumuda-sena and Aja-varman have also been discovered.

=== Gupta period ===

Around the fourth century, the region came under the control of the Guptas, who revived Brahmanism. The &quot;Vayu Purana&quot; and the &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot; attest that the early Gupta kings ruled Saketa. No Gupta-era archaeological layers have been discovered in present-day Ayodhya, although a large number of Gupta coins have been discovered here. It is possible that during the Gupta period, the habitations in the city were located in the areas that have not yet been excavated. The Buddhist sites that had suffered destruction during the Khotanese-Kushan invasion appear to have remained deserted. The fifth-century Chinese traveller Faxian states that the ruins of Buddhist buildings existed at &quot;Sha-chi&quot; during his time. One theory identifies Sha-chi with Saketa, although this identification is not undisputed. If Sha-chi is indeed Saketa, it appears that by the fifth century, the town no longer had a flourshing Buddhist community or any important Buddhist building that was still in use.

An important development during the Gupta time was the recognition of Saketa as the legendary city of Ayodhya, the capital of the Ikshvaku dynasty. The 436 AD Karamdanda (Karmdand) inscription, issued during the reign of Kumaragupta I, names Ayodhya as the capital of the Kosala province, and records commander Prithvisena&#x27;s offerings to Brahmins from Ayodhya. Later, the capital of the Gupta Empire was moved from Pataliputra to Ayodhya. Paramartha states that king Vikramaditya moved the royal court to Ayodhya; Xuanzang also corroborates this, stating that this king moved the court to the &quot;country of Shravasti&quot;, that is, Kosala. A local oral tradition of Ayodhya, first recorded in writing by Robert Montgomery Martin in 1838, mentions that the city was deserted after the death of Rama&#x27;s descendant Brihadbala. The city remain deserted until King Vikrama of Ujjain came searching for it, and re-established it. He cut down the forests that had covered the ancient ruins, erected the Ramgar fort, and built 360 temples.

Vikramditya was a title of multiple Gupta kings, and the king who moved the capital to Ayodhya is identified as Skandagupta. Bakker theorises that the move to Ayodhya may have been prompted by a flooding of the river Ganges at Pataliputra, the need to check the Huna advance from the west, and Skandagupta&#x27;s desire to compare himself with Rama (whose Ikshvaku dynasty is associated with the legendary Ayodhya). According to Paramaratha&#x27;s &quot;Life of Vasubandhu&quot;, Vikramaditya was a patron of scholars, and awarded 300,000 pieces of gold to Vasubandhu. The text states that Vasubandhu was a native of Saketa (&quot;Sha-ki-ta&quot;), and describes Vikramaditya as the king of Ayodhya (&quot;A-yu-ja&quot;). This wealth was used to build three monasteries in the country of A-yu-ja (Ayodhya). Paramartha further states that the later king Baladitya (identified with Narasimhagupta) and his mother also awarded large sums of gold to Vasubandhu, and these funds were used to build another Buddhist temple at Ayodhya. These structures may have been seen by the seventh century Chinese traveller Xuanzang, who describes a stupa and a monastery at Ayodhya (&quot;O-yu-t-o&quot;).

=== Decline as a political centre ===
Ayodhya probably suffered when the Hunas led by Mihirakula invaded the Gupta empire in the sixth century. After the fall of the Guptas, it may have been ruled by the Maukhari dynasty, whose coins have been found in the nearby areas. It was not devastated, as Xuanzang describes it as a flourishing town and a Buddhist centre. However, it had lost its position as an important political centre to Kanyakubja (Kannauj). At the time of Xuanzang&#x27;s visit, it was a part of Harsha&#x27;s empire, and was probably the seat of a vassal or an administrative officer. Xuanzang states that the city measured about 0.6 km (20 li) in circumference. Another seventh-century source, &quot;Kāśikāvṛttī&quot;, mentions that the town was surrounded by a moat similar to that around Pataliputra.

After the fall of Harsha&#x27;s empire, Ayodhya appears to have been variously controlled by local kings and the rulers of Kannauj, including Yashovarman and the Gurjara-Pratiharas. The town is not mentioned in any surviving texts or inscriptions composed during 650–1050 AD, although it may be identified with the &quot;city of Harishchandra&quot; mentioned in the eighth-century poem &quot;Gaudavaho&quot;. Archaeological evidence (including images to Vishnu, Jain tirthankaras, Ganesha, the seven Matrikas, and a Buddhist stupa) suggests that the religious activity in the area continued during this period.

=== Early medieval period ===
According to Indologist Hans T. Bakker, the only religious significance of Ayodhya in the first millennium AD was related to the &quot;Gopratara&quot; tirtha (now called Guptar Ghat), where Rama and his followers are said to have ascended to heaven by entering the waters of Sarayu.

In the 11th century, the Gahadavala dynasty came to power in the region, and promoted Vaishnavism. They built several Vishnu temples in Ayodhya, five of which survived till the end of Aurangzeb&#x27;s reign. Hans Bakker concludes that there might have been a temple at the supposed birth spot of Rama built by the Gahadavalas (see Vishnu Hari inscription). In subsequent years, the cult of Rama developed within Vaishnavism, with Rama being regarded as the foremost avatar of Vishnu. Between the 13th and 18th century, Ayodhya&#x27;s importance as a pilgrimage centre grew.

In 1226 AD, Ayodhya became the capital of the province of Awadh (or &quot;Oudh&quot;) within the Delhi sultanate. Muslim historians state that the area was little more than wilderness prior to this. Pilgrimage was tolerated, but the tax on pilgrims ensured that the temples did not receive much income.

=== Mughal period ===
Under Mughal rule, the Babri mosque was constructed in Ayodhya. The city was the capital of the province of Awadh (mispronounced as &quot;Oudh&quot; by the British), which is also believed to be a variant of the name &quot;Ayodhya&quot;.

After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707 AD, the central Muslim rule weakened, and Awadh became virtually independent, with Ayodhya as its capital. However, the rulers became increasingly dependent on the local Hindu nobles, and control over the temples and pilgrimage centres was relaxed.

=== British period ===
In the 1850s, a group of Hindus attacked the Babri mosque, on the grounds that it was built over the birthplace of the Hindu deity Rama. To prevent further disputes, the British administrators divided the mosque premises between Hindus and Muslims.

Ayodhya was annexed in 1856 by the British rulers. The rulers of Awadh were Shia, and the Sunni groups had already protested against the permissive attitude of the former government. The British intervened and crushed the Sunni resistance. In 1857, the British annexed Oudh (Awadh) and subsequently reorganised it into the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh.

=== Independent India ===


A movement was launched in 1984 by the Vishva Hindu Parishad party to reclaim the Babri mosque site for a Rama temple. In 1992, a right wing Hindu nationalist rally turned into a riot, leading to the demolition of the Babri mosque. A makeshift temple at Ram Janmabhoomi for &quot;Ram Lalla&quot;, infant Rama was constructed. Under the Indian government orders, no one was permitted near the site within 200 yards, and the gate was locked to the outside. Hindu pilgrims, however, began entering through a side door to offer worship.

In 2003, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) carried out an excavation at the mosque site to determine if it was built over the ruins of a temple. The excavation uncovered pillar bases indicating a temple had been in existence under the mosque. Besides Hindus, the Buddhist and Jain representatives claimed that their temples existed at the excavated site.

On 5 July 2005, five terrorists attacked the site of the makeshift Ramlalla temple in Ayodhya. All five were killed in the ensuing gunfight with security forces, and one civilian died in the bomb blast triggered as they attempted to breach the cordon wall.

On 30 September 2010, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court ruled that one-third of the disputed land should be given to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board, one-third to the Nirmohi Akhara and one-third to the Hindu party for the shrine of &quot;Ram Lalla&quot; (infant Rama). The court further ruled that the area where the idols of Ram are present be given to Hindus in the final decree, while the rest of the land shall be divided equally by metes and bounds among the three parties. The judgement, along with evidences provided by the Archaeological Survey of India, upheld that the Babri Masjid was built after demolishing the Hindu temple, which is the birthplace of Rama, and that the mosque was not constructed according to the principles of Islam. The final verdict by the Supreme Court on the case ruled the disputed land in the favour of Hindus for the construction of Ram Mandir and ordered an alternative piece of land be given to the Muslim community for the construction of a mosque.

In a judgement pronounced by a 5 judge bench of the Supreme Court of India on 9 November 2019, the land was handed over to the government to form a trust for the construction of a temple. The court instructed the government to also allot a plot of in Ayodhya to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board to construct a mosque/Masjid.

Some South Koreans have identified the &quot;Ayuta&quot; mentioned in their ancient Samgungnyusa legend with Ayodhya. According to this legend, the ancient Korean princess Heo Hwang-ok came from Ayuta. In the 2000s, the local government of Ayodhya and South Korea acknowledged the connection and held a ceremony to raise a statue of the princess.

On 5 August 2020, the prime minister of India, Narendra Modi, laid the ceremonial foundation stone for a new temple at what is believed to be the birthplace of the god, Ram. It was planned to build a new township, Navya Ayodhya, on a site next to the Faizabad-Gorakhpur highway, which will have luxury hotels and apartment complexes.

<text>Christopher Lambert, born Christophe Guy Denis Lambert (; ; born March 29, 1957), is a French-American actor, producer, and writer. He started his career playing supporting parts in several French films, and became internationally famous for portraying Tarzan in &quot;&quot; (1984). For his performance in the film &quot;Subway&quot; (1985), he received the César Award for Best Actor. He is best known for his role of Connor MacLeod in the adventure-fantasy film &quot;Highlander&quot; (1986) and the subsequent franchise of the same name, Raiden in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1995), Methodius in &quot;Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance&quot; (2011), and Arne Seslum in &quot;Hail, Caesar!&quot; (2016). He also served as executive producer for &quot;Nine Months&quot; (1995).

==Early life==
Christophe Guy Denis Lambert was born in Great Neck, New York, on March 29, 1957, the son of Yolande Agnès Henriette (née de Caritat de Peruzzis), and Georges Lambert-Lamond, a French diplomat at the United Nations. His father was Jewish. Due to his father&#x27;s work, Lambert moved with his parents to Switzerland at the age of two, and was raised in Geneva, where he attended the International School of Geneva and the Institut Florimont until his teenage years, when the family moved to France and settled in Paris. Lambert&#x27;s debut in acting was in a school play age 12.

==Career==
Director Hugh Hudson and Warner Brothers sought out Lambert, wanting an unknown actor to play Tarzan, a human raised by apes in the jungle. Lambert got the role beating out Viggo Mortensen and Stellan Skarsgard partly due to his myopia, because when he took off his glasses it seemed he was always looking into the distance. Released in 1984, &quot;&quot;, was nominated for many awards. Also that year, Lambert starred opposite Catherine Deneuve in &quot;Love Songs&quot;.

He played the lead in Luc Besson&#x27;s stylistic film &quot;Subway&quot; (1985), about a man being hunted in the underground subways of Paris. 

In 1986, Lambert would appear in &quot;Highlander&quot; a role he would be best known for. In the film, Lambert starred as Connor MacLeod, an immortal warrior who could only be killed by decapitation. Lambert was cast in the role after Kurt Russell dropped out of the film and after director Russell Mulcahy saw a picture of him in a magazine. Despite barely speaking English, Lambert spent weeks learning the language before filming with a dialect coach. The film became a cult hit and was an international box-office success, rock group Queen composed and performed the soundtrack, and Lambert also appeared as MacLeod in the music video for Queen&#x27;s &quot;Princes of the Universe&quot;. In 1987, Lambert played the leading role of Salvatore Giuliano in &quot;The Sicilian&quot;, directed by Michael Cimino. In 1988, he starred in Agnieszka Holland&#x27;s &quot;To Kill a Priest&quot;, in which he played a character based on Jerzy Popiełuszko and his murder under the Polish communist regime.

He was offered the role of Martin Riggs in Lethal Weapon but he turned the role down. He was John Glen&#x27;s first choice for the role of James Bond in The Living Daylights. But he was ultimately turned down due to his accent. He was also considered for the lead role of Edward Lewis in Pretty Woman back when the film was known as 3000. 

In 1991, &quot;Highlander II: The Quickening&quot; premiered, reuniting Lambert with director Russell Mulcahy and fellow actor Sean Connery. Shot in Argentina to reduce production costs; which was going through a financial crisis, much of the script was not filmed and the final result was a patchwork. It was said, Lambert threatened to walk out of the project when it was nearing fruition, However, due to contractual obligations, he did reconsider. In 1992, he appeared in three projects. He appeared in the first episode of the television show &quot;&quot;, passing on the lead role to actor Adrian Paul. He also appeared in the French crime thriller &quot;Max et Jérémie&quot;, co-starring Philippe Noiret and Jean-Pierre Marielle.

In 1993, Carl Schenkel&#x27;s suspense thriller &quot;Knight Moves&quot; premiered, in which Lambert was both an executive producer and the lead. Lambert plays a chess grandmaster suspected of murder. Later that year, Stuart Gordon&#x27;s science fiction film &quot;Fortress&quot; premiered, with Lambert playing the lead. The story takes place in a dystopian future where a man and his wife are sent to a maximum-security prison because they are expecting a second child, which is against the strict one-child policy.

1994 saw the release of two collaborations with actor Mario Van Peebles. They played the side by side leads in the action film &quot;Gunmen&quot;, and Van Peebles was the main villain in &quot;Highlander III: The Sorcerer&quot;. In this third installment of the franchise, Connor MacLeod is forced to face a new, dangerous enemy, a powerful sorcerer known as Kane who wants to gain world domination. Lambert also starred in the action film &quot;Roadflower&quot;. In France, he produced his second Patrick Braoudé film called &quot;Neuf mois&quot;, which was nominated for two Césars.

In 1995, he played the role of the thunder god Raiden in the Paul W. S. Anderson&#x27;s movie adaptation of the popular video game series &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. The plot of the film follows the warrior monk Liu Kang, the actor Johnny Cage, and the soldier Sonya Blade, all three guided by the god Raiden, on their journey to combat the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung and his forces in a tournament to save Earth. Lambert later reprised the role in the MK Movie Skin Pack in the 2020 game &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;. Also that year, he also starred in the American-Japanese martial arts action film &quot;The Hunted&quot;, directed by J. F. Lawton, with a cast that included John Lone, Joan Chen, Yoshio Harada, and Yoko Shimada, and produced Xavier Beauvois&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget You&#x27;re Going to Die&quot;, which won the Special Jury Award at the Gijón International Film Festival, won the Prix Jean Vigo, won the Jury Prize and was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Lambert was also an executive producer on Chris Columbus&#x27; &quot;Nine Months&quot;, an English-language remake of &quot;Neuf mois&quot;.

In 1996, Lambert was an executive producer and the lead in Nils Gaup&#x27;s western film &quot;North Star&quot;, co-starring James Caan. The same year he was a producer of &quot;When Saturday Comes&quot;, a football sport drama starring Sean Bean. In 1997, he starred in Gabriele Salvatores&#x27; cyberpunk science fiction film &quot;Nirvana&quot;. The film tells the story of a virtual reality game designer, played by Lambert, who discovers that the main character of his game has achieved sentience due to an attack by a computer virus. The film was screened out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival. The same year, he also co-lead with Ice-T in the action film &quot;Mean Guns&quot;, and starred in the French film &quot;Arlette&quot; by Claude Zidi.

In 1998, he produced and starred in &quot;Operation Splitsville,&quot; a remake of &quot;Génial, mes parents divorcent&quot;, which he produced several years earlier. The same year, he produced and played a man with a mental disability, who moved into a nursing home, in the film &quot;Gideon&quot;. In 1999, he produced and starred in Russell Mulcahy&#x27;s &quot;Resurrection&quot;, where he plays a detective who is assigned to investigate the savage murder of a man who has bled to death from a severed arm. He also starred in science fantasy-action film &quot;Beowulf&quot;. In 2000, he played in the fourth installment of the &quot;Highlander&quot; franchise, &quot;&quot;. The film reunited him with Adrian Paul, and would be last sequel Lambert appeared in. The same year, he was still on the run from authorities in the sequel &quot;Fortress 2: Re-Entry&quot;.
He also starred in John Glen&#x27;s &quot;The Point Men&quot;, about a team of Israeli agents being killed off one-by-one after a botched anti-terrorist operation. In 2003, he played in &quot;Absolon&quot;, a post-apocalyptic science fiction thriller film. He was an executive producer on the film &quot;The Confessor&quot; (also known as &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot;) starring Christian Slater, Molly Parker, and Stephen Rea. In 2006, he was an executive producer and star on the film &quot;Day of Wrath&quot;. He also played a supporting role in Richard Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Southland Tales&quot;.

In 2007, he starred in the vampire film &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;. He starred in the Sophie Marceau directed French film &quot;Trivial&quot;. In 2009, Lambert was a lead in Claire Denis&#x27; &quot;White Material&quot;; both the film and Lambert&#x27;s performance received critical acclaim. The film stars Isabelle Huppert as a struggling French coffee producer in an unnamed French speaking African country, who decides to stay at her coffee plantation in spite of an erupting civil war. The film has appeared on a number of critics&#x27; top ten lists of the best films of 2010. That year, he also acted in &quot;Cartagena&quot;, with Sophie Marceau starring as a beautiful, free-spirited woman who becomes bedridden following a terrible accident. Against her better judgement, she hires a drunk middle-aged former boxer (Lambert) to cook and care for her. Although unqualified for the position, he is desperate for work, and slowly he wins the trust of the woman, who teaches him how to read. The film also won several awards in France.
In 2011, Lambert starred as the villainous head monk Methodius in the &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; sequel &quot;Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance&quot;, starring Nicolas Cage, in 2011. He underwent sword training for three months and shaved his head. The film made $132.6 million worldwide. Shortly afterwards, he got the role of Marcel Janvier (alias &quot;The Chameleon&quot;), a recurring villain in award-winning hit police crime TV drama &quot;&quot;. His character was in six episodes from 2012 to 2013 – the two highest-rated seasons of the show.

In 2014, he played in the biographical crime drama film &quot;Electric Slide&quot;, about the Los Angeles-based bank robber Eddie Dodson. In 2015, he co-starred in Claude Lelouch&#x27;s &quot;Un plus une&quot;, a French romantic comedy film. He also co-starred in the biographical film &quot;10 Days in a Madhouse&quot;, about the experiences of undercover journalist Nellie Bly. In 2016 he co-starred in &quot;Hail, Caesar!&quot;, a comedy film written, produced, edited, and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. It is a fictional story that follows the real-life &quot;fixer&quot; Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) working in the Hollywood film industry in the 1950s, trying to discover what happened to a cast member who vanished during the filming of a biblical epic. That year, he cameoed as a French Army Captain in &quot;La folle histoire de Max et Léon&quot;, a French World War II comedy film. He also had a recurring role in the Russian-Portuguese biographical television show &quot;Mata Hari&quot;. That year, he also played the lead villain in the martial arts film &quot;&quot;.

Lambert plays the role of SS officer Karl Frenzel in the Russian film &quot;Sobibor&quot; by director Konstantin Khabensky, which was released in 2018. The film is a World War II drama about the only successful uprising in a Nazi death camp. It was selected as the Russian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 91st Academy Awards. Lambert received high praise for &quot;an outstanding and nuanced performance; he is unrecognisable as Frenzel, a demonic, fractured character&quot;.

Lambert was part of the ensemble cast of &quot;Bel Canto&quot; from director Paul Weitz, an adaptation of the 2002 novel of the same name, by Ann Patchett. Lambert played the role of a French ambassador who was part of the Japanese embassy hostage crisis (also called the Lima Crisis) of 1996–1997 in Lima, Peru. Lambert received praise, along with the rest of the cast, for &quot;performances [that] are uniformly excellent&quot;.

== Other ventures ==
Lambert has written two novels: &quot;La fille porte-bonheur&quot; in 2011 and &quot;Le juge&quot; in 2015.

Along with owning a mineral water business and food processing plant, Lambert produces Côtes du Rhône wines with his business partner Eric Beaumard at a vineyard in Sainte-Cécile-les-Vignes. The label, &quot;Les Garrigues de Beaumard-Lambert&quot;, tops out at 4,000 cases and is sold mostly in Europe. Beaumard has primary creative control of the winery, but Lambert conducts barrel tests and monitors the various stages of the wine&#x27;s evolution.

==Personal life==
Lambert was married to American actress Diane Lane from 1988 until their divorce in 1994. Their daughter was born in 1993. Lambert married American actress Jaimyse Haft in 1999, and they divorced in 2000. From 2007 to 2014, he dated French actress Sophie Marceau.

Lambert has profound myopia and cannot see without his glasses. He cannot wear contact lenses and often has to perform while virtually blind, which has led to injuries while performing his own stunts.

* June 6 – Emperor Alexander III dies of exhaustion while playing the game &quot;tzykanion&quot; (Byzantine name for polo). He is succeeded by his 8-year-old nephew Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (&quot;born in the purple&quot;), a son of the late emperor Leo VI (the Wise). The government is administered by a regency council composed of Constantine&#x27;s mother, Empress Zoe Karbonopsina, Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos and his guardian John Eladas.
* August – Byzantine–Bulgarian War: Simeon I (the Great), ruler (&quot;knyaz&quot;) of the Bulgarian Empire, launches a campaign at the head of a large Bulgarian army, and reaches Constantinople unopposed. The Bulgarians besiege the Byzantine capital and construct ditches from the Golden Horn to the Golden Gate at the Marmara Sea. After negotiations the siege is lifted and Simeon is recognised as emperor of the Bulgarians.
* Summer – Constantine Doukas, a Byzantine general (&quot;magister militum&quot;), tries, unsuccessfully, with the support of several aristocrats to usurp the throne from the young Constantine VII. He is killed in a clash by the soldiers of the &quot;Hetaireia&quot; guard, assembled by John Eladas. His head is cut off and presented to Constantine.

<text>Cameron Michelle Diaz (born August 30, 1972) is an American actress. Prolific in both comedy and drama, her films have grossed over $3 billion in the U.S. box-office. Her output of romantic comedies in the late 1990s and early 2000s established her as a prominent sex symbol and one of Hollywood&#x27;s most bankable stars, and in 2013 she was named the highest-paid actress over 40. Diaz has received various accolades, including nominations for a British Academy Film Award and four Golden Globe Awards.

Born in San Diego, California, Diaz was raised in Long Beach. While still in high school, she signed a modeling contract with Elite Model Management. She made her film debut at age 21 opposite Jim Carrey in the comedy &quot;The Mask&quot; (1994). Following a supporting role in the romantic comedy &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1997), she starred as the titular character in the Farrelly brothers&#x27; comedy &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; (1998), which brought her increased fame and her first Golden Globe nomination. Her following two projectsthe sports drama &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; and Spike Jonze&#x27;s fantasy film &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; (both 1999)earned Diaz recognition as a dramatic actress. 

Diaz received praise for her supporting roles in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; (2001) and Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; (2002) and had greater commercial success in the action comedy &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (2000) and its 2003 sequel, as well as for voicing Princess Fiona in the &quot;Shrek&quot; franchise (2001–present). Her subsequent films include the comedies &quot;In Her Shoes&quot; (2005), &quot;The Holiday&quot; (2006), &quot;What Happens in Vegas&quot; (2008), &quot;Knight and Day&quot; (2010), &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; (2011), and &quot;Bad Teacher&quot; (2011). After starring in three successful comedies in 2014&quot;The Other Woman&quot;, &quot;Sex Tape&quot; and &quot;Annie&quot;Diaz retired from acting to focus on her family, but made a return to the profession with the action comedy &quot;Back in Action&quot; (2025).

Diaz has also written two health books: &quot;The Body Book&quot; (2013), a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, and &quot;The Longevity Book&quot; (2016). Her personal life has drawn media attention throughout the course of her career, mostly regarding her relationships and fashion choices. In 2015, Diaz married Good Charlotte guitarist Benji Madden; they have two children via surrogate.

==Early life==
Cameron Michelle Diaz was born August 30, 1972, in San Diego, California, to Billie ( Early), an import/export agent, and Emilio Diaz, a foreman of the California oil company Unocal. Diaz has an elder sister, Chimene. Her father&#x27;s family is Cuban, and Diaz&#x27;s ancestors had originally moved from Spain to Cuba. Diaz stated that her direct Spanish ancestors were originally from Cadiz. Later, they settled in Ybor City, Tampa, Florida, before moving to the Los Angeles area, where her father was born. Her mother has predominantly English and German ancestry.

Diaz was raised in Long Beach and attended Los Cerritos Elementary School, and then Long Beach Polytechnic High School, where she was a schoolmate of Snoop Dogg. She recalled her upbringing as frugal, stating: &quot;I had amazing parents, they were awesome. We weren&#x27;t privilegedvery much the opposite. My family would collect [soda] cans to turn in for extra money, because $20 meant something to us. But we were very happy.&quot;

While still attending high school, Diaz signed a modeling contract with Elite Model Management at age 16 and appeared in advertisements for Calvin Klein and Levi&#x27;s. The following year, at age 17, she was featured on the cover of the July 1990 issue of &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine. Diaz also modeled for 2 to 3 months in Australia and shot a commercial for Coca-Cola in Sydney in 1991.

==Career==
===1994–1998: Early films and rise to fame===
At the age of 21, Diaz auditioned for &quot;The Mask&quot;, playing a jazz singer named Tina Carlyle, based on the recommendation of an agent for Elite, who met the film&#x27;s producers while they were searching for the lead actress. Having no previous acting experience, she started acting lessons after being cast. &quot;The Mask&quot; became one of the top ten highest-grossing films of 1994 and launched Diaz as a sex symbol. During this period, Diaz dated video producer Carlos de la Torre.

Diaz subsequently starred in the independent black comedy &quot;The Last Supper&quot; (1995), playing one of several liberal graduate students who invite a group of extremist conservatives to a dinner in an attempt to murder them. Roger Ebert deemed the film &quot;a brave effort in a timid time, a Swiftian attempt to slap us all in the face and get us to admit that our own freedoms depend precisely on those of our neighbors, our opponents and, yes, our enemies.&quot; She then had a lead role as an ex-stripper in the dramatic comedy &quot;Feeling Minnesota&quot; (1996), in which she co-starred opposite Keanu Reeves, Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio, and Courtney Love. Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; noted: &quot;Sadly, with the notable exception of the attractive Diaz, who&#x27;s well cast as the sexual aggressor and romantic manipulator, there are no exciting performances in the film.&quot; The same year, she was cast opposite Jennifer Aniston in the Edward Burns-directed comedy &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot; (1996), followed by a starring role in &quot;Head Above Water&quot; (1996), a crime-comedy in which she played an unfaithful wife implicated in her ex-lover&#x27;s murder.

She was scheduled to perform in the film &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, but had to resign after breaking her hand while training for the role. Besides a starring part in the little-seen &quot;A Life Less Ordinary&quot;, Diaz returned to mainstream in 1997 with the romantic comedy &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot;. In it, she starred opposite Julia Roberts, playing the wealthy fiancée of a sportswriter who is the long-time friend of Roberts&#x27; character. The film was a global box-office hit and is considered one of the best romantic comedy films of all time.

In 1998, Diaz starred in &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;, as the titular role of a woman living in Miami having several men vying for her affections. It was remarked in &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;: &quot;As the Mary at the center of it all, Diaz certainly exudes that irresistible &#x27;something&#x27; expressed in the title. In films such as &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot; and &quot;A Life Less Ordinary&quot;, Diaz has shown herself to be a good comic sport who is game for just about anything. Here, it&#x27;s no stretch to understand why, at the end of the movie, some half-dozen suitors have converged in her living room to throw themselves at her feet.&quot; The sleeper hit was the highest-grossing comedy of 1998 in North America as well as the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year; it made US$176million in the United States and US$369million worldwide. She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in the category of Best Actress – Musical or Comedy. Diaz also starred in the critically panned comedy &quot;Very Bad Things&quot; (1998).

===1999–2004: Dramatic roles and critical success===
She starred in Spike Jonze&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; (1999), portraying the pet-obsessed wife of an unemployed puppeteer who, through a portal, finds himself in the mind of actor John Malkovich. The film received widespread acclaim and was an arthouse success. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; concluded that Diaz &quot;does a hilarious turn&quot; in her &quot;frumpy wife&quot; role, and Roger Ebert felt that the actress, &quot;one of the best-looking women in movies, [...] here looks so dowdy we hardly recognize her [...] Diaz has fun with her talent by taking it incognito to strange places and making it work for a living&quot;. For her role, Diaz earned Best Supporting Actress nominations at the Golden Globe, BAFTA, and SAG Awards, however, she was snubbed for the Oscar, which was met with backlash. Her next film release in 1999 was Oliver Stone&#x27;s sports drama &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; (1999), in which veteran coach Tony D’Amato (Al Pacino) has fallen out of favor with her character Christina Pagniacci, the young woman who owns the team. While critical response was mixed, the film made US$100million globally.

In the film adaptation &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (2000), Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu played the trio of investigators in Los Angeles. The film was one of the highest-grossing films of the year, grossing US$264.1million. In 2001, Diaz starred in the Sundance-premiered independent drama &quot;The Invisible Circus&quot;, as a young woman who commits suicide in Europe in the 1970s, and next in the year, she appeared in &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;, as the former lover of a self-indulgent and vain publishing magnate (Tom Cruise). A wide critical response and commercial success greeted &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; upon its release; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called her &quot;compelling as the embodiment of crazed sensuality&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; said she gives a &quot;ferociously emotional&quot; performance. &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; similarly stated of the film, &quot;most impressive is Cameron Diaz, whose fatal-attraction stalker is both heartbreaking and terrifying.&quot; She earned nominations for Best Supporting Actress at the Golden Globe Awards, the SAG Awards, the Critics&#x27; Choice Awards, and the American Film Institute Awards for her performance in the film.

Also in 2001, she voiced Princess Fiona in the animated film &quot;Shrek&quot;. In the film, her character is plagued by a curse that transforms her into an ogress each and every sunset. Locked in a dragon-guarded castle for several years, she is rescued by the title character, whom she later comes to love. The film was a major commercial success, grossing US$484.4million worldwide and became the first movie to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. In 2002, Diaz headlined the romantic comedy &quot;The Sweetest Thing&quot;, playing a single woman educating herself on wooing the opposite sex when she finally meets the man of her dreams. The film was a moderate commercial success with a global gross of US$68.6million.

After completing &quot;Shrek&quot;, Diaz starred in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s epic period drama &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;, set in the mid-19th century in the Five Points district of New York City; she took on the role of a pickpocket-grifter and the love interest of Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s character. The film received positive reviews by critics and was a box office success, grossing a total of US$193million worldwide. A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, agreeing with other top critics on co-star Daniel Day-Lewis&#x27;s presence overshadowing Diaz and DiCaprio, felt that the actress &quot;ends up with no outlet for her spitfire energies, since her character is more a structural necessity — the linchpin of male jealousy — than a fully imagined person. The limitations of her role point to a more serious lapse, which is the movie&#x27;s lack of curiosity about what women&#x27;s lives might have been like in Old New York&quot;. Diaz next reprised her roles in the commercially successful sequels &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; (2003), and &quot;Shrek 2&quot; (2004).

===2005–2011: Established actress===

Diaz received substantial defamation damages from suing American Media Incorporated, after the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; posted an article and pictures with the headline &quot;Cameron Caught Cheating&quot; on their website in May 2005. The photos claimed to show Diaz cheating on her boyfriend at the time, Justin Timberlake, with the married MTV producer of her show &quot;Trippin&#x27;&quot;, Shane Nickerson. After Diaz complained, the article and pictures were removed from the web and the hard copy did not contain any of the content. The magazine apologized to Diaz, Timberlake, Nickerson and his wife for the distress caused and said the story was untrue and the picture showed no more than a goodbye hug between friends.

In her following film, Diaz played opposite Toni Collette and Shirley MacLaine in &quot;In Her Shoes&quot; (2005), a comedy-drama film based on the novel of the same name by Jennifer Weiner, which focuses on the relationship between two sisters and their grandmother. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, and Diaz garnered acclaim for her performance of a dyslectic engaged in a love-hate struggle with her plain, sensible sister (Collette), with &quot;USA Today&quot; calling it &quot;her best work&quot; at the time. She followed &quot;In Her Shoes&quot; with a role in Nancy Meyers&#x27; romantic comedy &quot;The Holiday&quot; (2006), also starring Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Jack Black. In it she played Amanda, an American movie trailer producer who arranges a home exchange with a British woman (Winslet). The film became one of the biggest commercial successes of the year, grossing more than US$205million worldwide.

Diaz&#x27;s only film of 2007 was &quot;Shrek the Third&quot;, the third installment in the &quot;Shrek&quot; franchise, which also featured Timberlake in a supporting role. Although the film was met with mixed reviews from critics, it grossed US$798million worldwide. The same year, Diaz also voiced Princess Fiona in a thirty-minute Christmas special, directed by Gary Trousdale. Diaz earned an estimated US$50 million during the period of a year ending June 2008, for her roles in the &quot;Shrek&quot; sequel and her next film &quot;What Happens in Vegas&quot; opposite Ashton Kutcher. A romantic comedy by Tom Vaughan, Diaz and Kutcher portrayed two strangers who awaken together to discover they have gotten married following a night in which they won a huge jackpot after playing the other&#x27;s quarter. Critic reviews were negative but the film still grossed US$219million with a budget of US$35million.

In 2009, she starred in &quot;My Sister&#x27;s Keeper&quot; and &quot;The Box&quot;. Based on Jodi Picoult&#x27;s novel of the same name, &quot;My Sister&#x27;s Keeper&quot; was released to mixed reviews in June 2009. In the drama, Diaz plays a former lawyer and mother of three, one of whom is dying of leukemia. A moderate commercial success, it grossed US$95million worldwide, mostly from its domestic run. Set in 1976, &quot;The Box&quot;, written and directed by Richard Kelly, stars Diaz and James Marsden as a couple who receive a box from a mysterious man who offers them one million dollars if they press the button sealed within the dome on top of a box, knowing that someone, somewhere, will die from it. Critical response towards the psychological horror film was mixed, and, though having grossed its budget back, was considered a financial disappointment.
In 2010, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Diaz as the richest female celebrity, ranking her number 60 among the wealthiest 100. Also that year, Diaz reprised her voice role of Princess Fiona in &quot;Shrek Forever After&quot;, the fourth installment in the &quot;Shrek&quot; series. Although the film opened to mixed reviews from critics, it grossed a worldwide total of over US$752million and became the fifth top-grossing film released that year. The same year, she also voiced Princess Fiona in a thirty-minute Halloween special. Also in 2010, Diaz reunited with her &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; co-star Tom Cruise in the action comedy film &quot;Knight and Day&quot;. In it, Diaz plays a classic car restorer who unwittingly gets caught up with the eccentric secret agent Roy Miller, played by Cruise, who is on the run from the Secret Service. &quot;Knight and Day&quot; received mixed reviews, and while the comedy performed poorly at the box office in its debut, it became a sleeper hit at the box office with a worldwide gross of US$262million.

In 2011, Diaz was cast as Lenore Case, a journalist, in the remake of the 1940s film &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;. Directed by Michel Gondry, Diaz starred alongside Seth Rogen, Jay Chou, and Christoph Waltz in the superhero action comedy film. Released to mixed to negative reviews from critics, who called it an &quot;overblown, interminable and unfunny update&quot;, the film ended its theatrical run on April 21, 2011, with a worldwide gross total of US$228million. The same year, she played opposite Timberlake and Jason Segel in Jake Kasdan&#x27;s adult comedy &quot;Bad Teacher&quot;. In the film, Diaz plays an immoral, gold-digging Chicago-area middle school teacher at the fictional John Adams Middle School who curses at her students, drinks heavily, and smokes marijuana. Again, it received mostly negative reviews from critics who felt that &quot;in spite of a promising concept and a charmingly brazen performance from Diaz, &quot;Bad Teacher&quot; is never as funny as it should be.&quot; A commercial hit however, the R-rated comedy grossed US$216million worldwide. Also in 2011, Diaz was listed among &quot;CEOWorld Magazine&quot;″s Top Accomplished Women Entertainers.

===2012–2014: Focus on comedies===
In 2012 Diaz was cast in &quot;What to Expect When You&#x27;re Expecting&quot;, directed by Kirk Jones and based on the pregnancy guide of the same name. Diaz, who filmed her scenes in a two-week period, portrays Jules Baxter, a contestant on a celebrity dance show and a host to a weight-loss fitness show, who becomes pregnant with her dance partner&#x27;s baby. Upon release, the ensemble comedy received mostly negative reviews, but became a moderate commercial success with a worldwide gross of US$84.4million. Diaz&#x27;s other film that year was &quot;Gambit&quot;, a remake of the 1966 film of the same name directed by Michael Hoffman and scripted by Joel and Ethan Coen. The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews, and performed poorly at the box office, grossing only US$10million internationally. Diaz also voiced Sigmund Freud in &quot;A Liar&#x27;s Autobiography&quot; (2012), a British animated comedy film that is a (deliberately) completely inaccurate portrayal of the life of Monty Python alumnus Graham Chapman.

Diaz&#x27;s only film project of 2013 was Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Counselor&quot;, co-starring Michael Fassbender, Javier Bardem, Penélope Cruz, and Brad Pitt. In the thriller about greed, death, the primal instincts of humans and their consequences, Diaz plays a pathological liar and a sociopath, an immigrant who is now living the high-life after escaping a sordid past as an exotic dancer. While the film&#x27;s reception was negative, her performance was praised as one of her best in recent years. In late 2013, she published a health book, &quot;The Body Book: Feed, Move, Understand and Love Your Amazing Body&quot;, co-written with Sandra Bark. It was no. 2 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list in March 2014. 

Diaz&#x27;s first film of 2014 was the romantic revenge comedy &quot;The Other Woman&quot; opposite Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Leslie Mann, and Kate Upton. While &quot;The Other Woman&quot; received mostly negative reviews from critics, who felt that it settled for cheap laughs, it opened atop the US weekend box office with earnings of US$24.7million across the three days; it eventually made US$83.9million in North America and US$196.7million globally. Her next film release in 2014 was the comedy &quot;Sex Tape&quot;, in which she starred with Segel again as a married couple waking up to discover that a sex tape they had made went missing, leading to a frantic search for its whereabouts. It ultimately became a moderate commercial success with a worldwide gross of US$126million. The role required Diaz to perform multiple scenes of nudity. On her decision to appear nude, Diaz said: &quot;People have seen my butt. I&#x27;ve shown the top of my butt, the bottom of my butt. I&#x27;m not opposed to doing nudity, as long as it&#x27;s part of the story. I&#x27;ll do whatever has to get done if it&#x27;s the right thing.&quot; 

Her final film that year was the film adaptation &quot;Annie&quot;, co-starring Quvenzhané Wallis, Jamie Foxx, and Rose Byrne. She took on the role of Miss Colleen Hannigan, the cruel control freak of the foster home where the titular character resides. Upon its December premiere, &quot;Annie&quot; made US$133million worldwide, with Diaz&#x27;s performance garnering polarized reviews; critics praising her effort, but ultimately calling it too &quot;vampy&quot;, as well as &quot;strident and obnoxious&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; says that she &quot;overacts the role to the point of hysteria&quot;. 

===2015–present: Acting hiatus and return===
Diaz decided to take a break from acting following the release of &quot;Annie&quot;, stating in July 2017 that she became tired of traveling for filming, and confirmed her retirement the following March. She released &quot;The Longevity Book: The Science of Aging, the Biology of Strength, and the Privilege of Time&quot; in June 2016. She has since invested in health and biotech startups, including Seed Health and Modern Acupuncture. In May 2019, she was a keynote speaker at The Infatuation&#x27;s annual food festival, EEEEEATSCON. In 2020, Diaz launched an organic wine brand, Avaline, with business partner Katherine Power. In 2022, she appeared as a guest judge in the season opener episode of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race All Stars 7&quot;, and stated she was a huge fan of the show.

In June 2022, it was announced that Diaz would return to acting by starring alongside Foxx in the Netflix action-comedy &quot;Back in Action&quot;, which was released on Netflix on January 17, 2025. In March 2024, Diaz was announced to be in talks to star in the Apple Original Film &quot;Outcome&quot; alongside Keanu Reeves. Filming started for the project later that month. She will reprise her voice role as Princess Fiona in &quot;Shrek 5&quot;, scheduled for release in 2026.

== Personal life ==

===Relationships and family===
From 1990 to 1994, Diaz cohabited with video producer Carlos de la Torre, whom she met in Japan while filming an LA Gear ad. From January 1996 to September 1998, Diaz dated her &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; co-star Matt Dillon. She was unofficially engaged to actor/singer Jared Leto between 1999 and 2003. From April 2003 to December 2006, she dated singer Justin Timberlake. From May 2010 to September 2011, Diaz dated former New York Yankees player Alex Rodriguez. Diaz married musician Benji Madden at her home in Beverly Hills, California, on January 5, 2015, in a Jewish ceremony. The couple had been introduced ten months earlier by her close friend Nicole Richie who is married to Madden&#x27;s twin brother Joel. In December 2019, the couple became parents to their first child via surrogate pregnancy, a daughter. In March 2024, it was announced that the couple had a second child, a son.

===Explicit media and lawsuit===
In May 1992, she was photographed and videotaped topless for an S&amp;M leather fashion lingerie editorial by John Rutter, a professional photographer. The photographs and video were never released. Rutter approached Diaz in 2003, ahead of the release of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot;, offering to sell the pictures and video to her for million (equivalent to $million in ) before attempting to sell them to prospective buyers. He stated that he was offering her first right of refusal to them; she saw it as attempted blackmail and sued him. In July 2004, the 30-minute video of the photo shoot, entitled &quot;She&#x27;s No Angel&quot;, was released on a Russian website. Rutter denied releasing it. On September 16, 2005, Rutter was sentenced to more than three years in prison for attempted grand theft, forgery, and perjury.

On February 27, 2025, it was confirmed that Diaz had been one of the people who had traveled on Jeffrey Epstein&#x27;s private plane to his private island in the Virgin Islands.

==Other work==
Known for her environmental activism, Diaz was an early adopter of the Toyota Prius hybrid and worked to promote Al Gore&#x27;s Live Earth campaign, raising awareness of climate change. She was also critical of the George W. Bush administration. She wore a T-shirt that read &quot;I won&#x27;t vote for a son of a Bush!&quot; while making publicity visits for &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. Diaz has been involved with the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), the first and largest non-profit organization for veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and has spoken as an advocate for military families.

==Acting credits and accolades==

Diaz has received various accolades, including nominations for four Golden Globe Awards, three Screen Actors Guild Awards and a British Academy Film Award. In 2016, &quot;IndieWire&quot; named her one of the greatest actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.

<text>Homeland security is an American national security term for &quot;the national effort to ensure a homeland that is safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards where American interests, aspirations, and ways of life can thrive&quot; to the &quot;national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce the vulnerability of the U.S. to terrorism, and minimize the damage from attacks that do occur.&quot; According to an official work published by the Congressional Research Service in 2013, the &quot;Homeland security&quot; term&#x27;s definition has varied over time.

Homeland security is not constrained to terrorist incidents. Terrorism is violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature. Within the US, an all-hazards approach exists regarding homeland security endeavors. In this sense, homeland security encompasses both natural disasters and man-made events. Thus, the domain of homeland security must accommodate a plethora of situations and scenarios, ranging from natural disasters (e.g., Hurricane Katrina, Irma) to acts of terrorism (e.g., Boston Marathon bombing, September 11 attacks).

The term came about following enactment of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and reorganization of many U.S. government civil agencies effective March 1, 2003, to form the United States Department of Homeland Security after the September 11 attacks, and may refer to the actions of that department, the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, or the United States House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security.

The term, &quot;Homeland Security&quot; is not to be confused with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In its February 15, 2001 report, the U.S. Commission on National Security/21st Century, said the United States must change how it operates in the area of homeland security. The report recommended the creation of what was ultimately called the Department of Homeland Security.&quot;

DHS was formed by the Homeland security Act of 2002. The term, homeland security, is not the same as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS is an executive branch agency. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Homeland Security are both legislative bodies, and thus are clearly distinct from the executive agency, DHS. The actions of these two legislative bodies are not the same as actions of DHS.

Homeland defense (HD) is the military protection of U.S. territory, sovereignty, domestic population, and critical infrastructure against external threats and aggression.

==Definition==
&quot;Despite the [published] definition, mission statement, and vision [all of which have changed since 9/11], there is no consensus among practitioners and the public as to what the term Homeland Security actually means. Different groups view it differently. The extremes of opinion are represented, for the narrow view, by those who feel homeland security is only about terrorism. They believe focusing on anything additional dilutes, distracts, and weakens the homeland security mission.&quot;

Others say its focus is terrorism and natural disasters. Still others claim homeland security is about &#x27;all hazards&#x27; (terrorism, man-made disasters, and natural disasters). To some, homeland security is focused on &#x27;jurisdictional hazards&#x27; (i.e. homeland security means different things to different jurisdictions depending upon that jurisdiction&#x27;s particular hazards, risks, and level of preparedness). Examples of some of the jurisdictional hazards include hurricanes, tornados, flooding, and earthquakes. At the other extreme, the broad view of homeland security advocates that homeland security is about everything – that it implicates almost every sector.&quot;

== In the United States ==
Following the emergency response to Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and Hurricane Andrew in 1992 policy makers in Washington publicly voiced their frustration. A number of reforms were initiated to improve the effectiveness of the disaster relief system in the United States. In the United States, the concept of &quot;Homeland Security&quot; extends and recombines responsibilities of government agencies and entities. According to Homeland security research, the U.S. federal Homeland Security and Homeland Defense includes 187 federal agencies and departments, including the National Guard of the United States, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the United States Secret Service, the Transportation Security Administration, the 14 agencies that constitute the U.S. intelligence community and Civil Air Patrol. Although many businesses now operate in the area of homeland security, it is overwhelmingly a government function.

The George W. Bush administration consolidated many of these activities under the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), a new cabinet department established as a result of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. However, much of the nation&#x27;s homeland security activity remains outside of DHS; for example, the FBI and CIA are not part of the Department, and other executive departments such as the Department of Defense and United States Department of Health and Human Services and they play a significant role in certain aspects of homeland security. Homeland security is coordinated at the White House by the Adviser to the President for National Security and the Adviser to the President for Terrorism and Homeland Security. The staff of the National Security Council manages policy integration of National Security and Homeland Security. Homeland security is officially defined by the National Strategy for Homeland Security as &quot;a concerted national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce America&#x27;s vulnerability to terrorism, and minimize the damage and recover from attacks that do occur&quot;. Because the Department of Homeland Security includes the Federal Emergency Management Agency, it also has responsibility for preparedness, response, and recovery to natural disasters.

According to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget and Homeland Security Research Corporation, DHS Homeland security funding constitutes about 20-21 percent of the consolidated U.S. Homeland Security - Homeland Defense funding, while approximately 40 percent of the DHS budget funds civil, non-security activities, such as the U.S. coast guard search and rescue operations and customs functions. The U.S. Homeland Security is the world&#x27;s largest Homeland counter terror organization, having 40 percent of the global fiscal year homeland security funding.

The term &quot;Homeland security&quot; became prominent in the United States following the September 11 attacks. It had been used only in limited policy circles prior to these attacks. The phrase &quot;security of the American homeland&quot; appears in the 1998 report &quot;Catastrophic Terrorism: Elements of a National Policy&quot; by Ash Carter, John M. Deutch, and Philip D. Zelikow. Homeland security is also usually used to connote the civilian aspect of this effort. While &quot;homeland defense&quot; refers to its military component, led chiefly by the United States Northern Command, which is headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

The scope of homeland security includes:
* Emergency preparedness and response (for both terrorism and natural disasters), including volunteer medical, police, emergency management, and fire personnel;
* Domestic and International intelligence activities, largely today within the FBI;
* Critical infrastructure, including physical/perimeter and cyber protection;
* Investigation of people making and distributing child pornography;
* Border control, including land, maritime and country borders (also known as Ports of Entry (PoEs). Border management has two key goals: facilitating the flow of legitimate trade and traveling, while ensuring legitimate immigration;
* Transportation and logistics security, including aviation, maritime, and land transportation; As higher volumes of cargoes are processed at the borders each year, security risks also increase. In fact, illegitimate entities such as money laundering, drug trafficking, contraband and human trafficking cartels strategically select busy ports of entry and high traffic times, seeking to penetrate the borders;
* Biodefense;
* Detection of radioactive and radiological materials;
* Research on next-generation security technologies.
* Investigation on Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) involved in human trafficking, drug trafficking, contraband, money laundering, extortion;

===Criticism===
Conflicts exist between bodies of international law (ratified by the United States or not) and those applied under &quot;homeland security&quot;. One example is the notion of an unlawful combatant. The United States government has created a new status that addresses prisoners captured by a military force who do not conform with the conditions of the Convention. While the United States has only been a signatory to portions of the Geneva Conventions, much international law is based upon it.

===As a field of study===

Shortly after the September 11 attacks, Homeland security also took off as an up-and-coming academic field with a number of schools in the United States offering Academic certificate and degree programs in Homeland Security. The field is often studied alongside emergency management due to their similar nature and purposes. With the relatively sudden growth of the field, the quality of the programs vary greatly from one to another along with their respective accreditation statuses (or lack thereof). In a partial effort to combat these variations, the International Association of Emergency Managers offers a scholarship program with the aim of nurturing, promoting and developing disaster preparedness and resistance by furthering the education of students studying the fields of emergency management, disaster management or related programs such as Homeland Security.

Homeland Security is often thought of as a specifically United States term referring to the role of the United States&#x27; reformed national security infrastructure beginning in 2003. However, neither the term nor the concept of Homeland Security are specific to the United States. Though terminology varies, an equivalent might be seen in Israel&#x27;s Ministry of Public Security. Within Homeland Security as an academic field, Homeland Security is sometimes studied in a comparative context by scholars of comparative politics or criminal justice. For example, the British political scientist Paul Wilkinson edited and contributed to a textbook on Homeland Security policy and practice from a British perspective. The scholar Nadav Morag looks at a global perspective on homeland security management and strategies in the book &quot;Comparative Homeland Security: Global Lessons&quot;.

===Professional Certification===
Certified Homeland Protection Professional is a professional certification established by the National Sheriffs&#x27; Association in partnership with the National Domestic Preparedness Coalition, through the Global Center for Threat, Risk, and Vulnerability.

<doc id="42106" wikidata="Q632718" url="?curid=42106" title="Crossfire (film)">
<text>Crossfire is a 1947 American film noir drama film starring Robert Young, Robert Mitchum and Robert Ryan which deals with the theme of antisemitism, as did that year&#x27;s Academy Award for Best Picture winner, &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot;. The film was directed by Edward Dmytryk and the screenplay was written by John Paxton, based on the 1945 novel &quot;The Brick Foxhole&quot; by screenwriter and director Richard Brooks. The film&#x27;s supporting cast features Gloria Grahame and Sam Levene. The picture received five Oscar nominations, including Ryan for Best Supporting Actor and Gloria Grahame for Best Supporting Actress. It was the first B movie to receive a Best Picture nomination.

==Plot==
In the opening scene, a man is half-seen beating a Jewish man named Joseph Samuels to death in a hotel room. After the police are called in to investigate his murder, Captain Finlay suspects that the murderer may be among a group of demobilized soldiers who had been with Samuels and his female companion at a hotel bar the night of his death.

Ex-cop &quot;Monty&quot; Montgomery tells Finlay that he and his friend Floyd Bowers met Samuels at the hotel bar and went up to his apartment to find Samuels talking to Cpl. &quot;Mitch&quot; Mitchell. Soon upon their arrival, a heavily drunk Mitch left Samuels&#x27; apartment alone, then Monty and Floyd left a minute or so later. Monty claims that it was the last time they saw Samuels alive.

Sergeant Keeley, concerned that Mitch may be the prime suspect, investigates the murder himself, hoping to clear his friend&#x27;s name. After helping Mitch escape from police capture, Keeley meets him in a movie theater, where Mitch recalls Monty arguing with Samuels inside his apartment. After Mitch left, he spent part of the night with Ginny Tremaine, a working girl he met in a dance hall. When Mitch woke up the next morning in Ginny&#x27;s apartment, she was not there. After hearing a knock at the door, Mitch met an odd man, who offered to make him coffee, and claimed he was waiting for Ginny too. While the man looked for some cigarettes, Mitch hastily left the apartment.

Meanwhile, Monty and Floyd meet in an apartment. Monty tells Floyd to stay out of sight and to keep their stories straight, that they had no argument with Samuels and left his apartment shortly after Mitch. Keeley knocks on their door and asks Floyd about the killing while Monty hides. After Keeley leaves, Monty – the actual killer – kills Floyd for refusing to stay out of sight, and then stages a hanging suicide.

Escorted by Officer Finlay, Mitch&#x27;s wife Mary visits Ginny at her apartment, hoping that Ginny will confess to spending the night with Mitch and prove he is innocent. Mary asks Finlay to wait outside, as a cop might make Ginny clam up. Ginny claims to have no knowledge of meeting Mitch, at which point Finlay enters the apartment to question her. Ginny recants and admits to knowing Mitch, but states that she never met him at her apartment. At this point, the odd man appears from a back room and tells Finlay that he remembers Mitch, thereby providing a partial alibi, but not for the estimated time of the murder.

Back at the police station, Finlay questions Monty a second time, hoping to uncover the motive for Samuels&#x27; murder, but sends him on his way. With Keeley in his office, Finlay suspects that antisemitism was the likely motive for Samuels&#x27; murder, because no person involved knew Samuels personally. Both suspect that Monty was responsible for killing both Samuels and Floyd since he is clearly antisemitic.

Finlay delivers a personal antiracist message to Keeley and a naive soldier named Leroy, who was in Monty&#x27;s unit, by recalling the death of his Irish grandfather during earlier historical bigotry. Winning over Leroy, Finlay sets a trap to catch Monty. Leroy tells a surprised Monty that Floyd wants to meet him and shows him an address he wrote down where he can find Floyd. Monty shows up at the apartment where he killed Floyd, presumably to check if he is still alive, and encounters Finlay and another cop. Finlay tells Monty he gave himself away as the address on the piece of paper was actually to a different building, nevertheless he came to the right apartment, proving he had been there before when he killed Floyd. Monty tries to escape but is shot dead by Finlay.

After Monty is killed, Finlay and Keeley say their goodbyes. As Finlay drives away, Keeley offers to buy Leroy a cup of coffee.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film&#x27;s screenplay, written by John Paxton, was based on director and screenwriter Richard Brooks&#x27; 1945 novel &quot;The Brick Foxhole&quot;. Brooks wrote his novel while he was a sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps making training films at Quantico, Virginia, and Camp Pendleton, California.

In the novel, the victim was a homosexual. As told in the film &quot;The Celluloid Closet&quot;, and in the documentary included on the DVD edition of the &quot;Crossfire&quot; film, the Hollywood Hays Code prohibited any mention of homosexuality because it was seen as a sexual perversion. Hence, the book&#x27;s theme of homophobia was changed to one about racism and antisemitism. Nevertheless, the fast rapport which develops between the artistic soldier and the sensitive older man hints at the original subtext. Director Edward Dmytryk later said that the Code &quot;had a very good effect because it made us think. If we wanted to get something across that was censorable... we had to do it deviously. We had to be clever. And it usually turned out to be much better than if we had done it straight.&quot;

The book was published while Brooks was serving in the Marine Corps. A fellow Marine, the politically-active actor Robert Ryan, met Brooks and told him he was determined to play in a version of the book on screen.

This was a prestige picture during Dore Schary&#x27;s brief tenure as Head of Production at RKO. The film premiered at the Rivoli Theatre in New York City on July 22, 1947.

A few months later producer Adrian Scott and director Edward Dmytryk were cited for contempt of Congress for refusing to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), becoming part of the blacklisted Hollywood Ten.

The US Army showed the film only at its US bases. The US Navy would not exhibit the film at all.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
When first released, &quot;Variety&quot; magazine gave the film a positive review, writing, &quot;&quot;Crossfire&quot; is a frank spotlight on antisemitism. Producer Dore Schary, in association with Adrian Scott, has pulled no punches. There is no skirting such relative &quot;fol-de-rol&quot; as intermarriage or clubs that exclude Jews. Here is a hard-hitting film [based on Richard Brooks&#x27; novel, &quot;The Brick Foxhole&quot;] whose whodunit aspects are fundamentally incidental to the overall thesis of bigotry and race prejudice... Director Edward Dmytryk has drawn gripping portraitures. The flashback technique is effective as it shades and colors the sundry attitudes of the heavy, as seen or recalled by the rest of the cast.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic, Bosley Crowther, lauded the acting in the drama, and wrote, &quot;Mr. Dmytryk has handled most excellently a superlative cast which plays the drama. Robert Ryan is frighteningly real as the hard, sinewy, loud-mouthed, intolerant and vicious murderer, and Robert Mitchum, Steve Brodie, and George Cooper are variously revealing as his pals. Robert Young gives a fine taut performance as the patiently questioning police lieutenant, whose mind and sensibilities are revolted—and eloquently expressed—by what he finds. Sam Levene is affectingly gentle in his brief bit as the Jewish victim, and Gloria Grahame is believably brazen and pathetic as a girl of the streets.&quot;

In an essay published in 1977, the Scottish writer Colin McArthur challenged the social reading of &quot;Crossfire&quot; by several Anglo-American critics, arguing that thematically and stylistically it was a film noir, and that it reflected that genre in being less concerned with the problems of a particular society, such as antisemitism, than with angst and loneliness as essential elements of the human condition.

Critic Dennis Schwartz questioned the noir aspects of the film in 2000, and discussed the cinematography in his review. He wrote, &quot;This is more of a message film than a noir thriller, but has been classified by most cinephiles in the noir category... J. Roy Hunt, the 70-year-old cinematographer, who goes back to the earliest days of Hollywood, shot the film using the style of low-key lighting, providing dark shots of Monty, contrasted with ghost-like shots of Mary Mitchell (Jacqueline White) as she angelically goes to help her troubled husband Arthur.&quot;

The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 88% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 24 reviews.

===Box office===
The film made a profit of $1,270,000.

<doc id="42107" wikidata="Q1278272" url="?curid=42107" title="SS Eastland">
<text>SS &quot;Eastland&quot; was a passenger ship based in Chicago and used for tours. On 24 July 1915, the ship rolled over onto its side while tied to a dock in the Chicago River. In total, 844 passengers and crew were killed in what was the largest loss of life from a single shipwreck on the Great Lakes.

After the disaster, &quot;Eastland&quot; was salvaged and sold to the United States Navy. After restorations and modifications, &quot;Eastland&quot; was designated a gunboat and renamed USS &quot;Wilmette&quot;. She was used primarily as a training vessel on the Great Lakes, and was scrapped after World War II.

==Construction==
The ship was ordered during 1902 by the Michigan Steamship Company and built by the Jenks Ship Building Company of Port Huron, Michigan. The ship was named in May 1903, immediately before her inaugural voyage.

==History==

===Early problems===
On 27 July of her 1903 inaugural season, the ship struck the laid-up tugboat &quot;George W. Gardner&quot;, which sank at its dock at the Lake Street Bridge in Chicago. &quot;Eastland&quot; received only minor damage.

===Mutiny on the &quot;Eastland&quot;===
On 14 August 1903, while on a cruise from Chicago to South Haven, Michigan, six of the ship&#x27;s firemen refused to stoke the fire for the ship&#x27;s boiler, claiming that they had not received their potatoes for a meal. When they refused to return to the fire hole, Captain John Pereue arrested the six men at gunpoint. Firemen George Lippen and Benjamin Myers, who were not a part of the group of six, stoked the fires until the ship reached harbor. Upon the ship&#x27;s arrival in South Haven, the six men were taken to the town jail and charged with mutiny. Shortly thereafter, Captain Pereue was replaced.

===Speed modifications===
Because the ship did not meet a targeted speed of during her inaugural season and had a draft too deep for the Black River in South Haven, Michigan, where she was being loaded, the ship returned in September 1903 to Port Huron for modifications, including the addition of an air-conditioning system, an induced-draft system for the boilers to increase power, and repositioning of the ship&#x27;s machinery to reduce the draft of the hull. Even though the modifications increased the ship&#x27;s speed, the reduced hull draft and extra weight mounted up high reduced the metacentric height and inherent stability as originally designed.
===Listing incidents ===
Upon her return to South Haven in May 1904, the ship handily won a race to Chicago against the &quot;City of South Haven&quot;. In the meantime, the &quot;Eastland&quot; was experiencing periodic problems with her stability while loading and unloading cargo and passengers, and nearly capsized on 17 July 1904 after leaving South Haven with about 3,000 passengers. Subsequently, her capacity was lowered to 2,800 passengers, cabins were removed, lifeboats were added and the hull was repaired. On 5 August 1906, another listing incident occurred, which resulted in complaints filed against the Chicago-South Haven Line that had purchased the ship earlier that year.

Before the 1907 season, the ship was sold to the Lake Shore Navigation Company and moved to Lake Erie. In 1909, the ship was sold again to the Eastland Navigation Company and continued running excursions between Cleveland and Cedar Point. After the 1909 season, the remaining 39 cabins were removed, and prior to the 1912 season, the top smokestack sections were removed to shorten her stack height. On 1 July 1912, another incident occurred when the &quot;Eastland&quot; experienced a severe listing of about 25° while loading passengers in Cleveland.

In June 1914, the &quot;Eastland&quot; was sold to the St. Joseph–Chicago Steamship Company and returned to Lake Michigan for St. Joseph, Michigan-to-Chicago service.

===The &quot;Eastland&quot; disaster===
On 24 July 1915, &quot;Eastland&quot; and four other Great Lakes passenger steamers—&quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;, &quot;Petoskey&quot;, &quot;Racine&quot;, and &quot;Rochester—&quot;were chartered to take employees from Western Electric Company&#x27;s Hawthorne Works in Cicero, Illinois to a picnic in Michigan City, Indiana.

The federal Seamen&#x27;s Act had been passed in 1915 following the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster three years earlier. The law required retrofitting of a complete set of lifeboats on &quot;Eastland&quot;, as on many other passenger vessels. This additional weight may have made &quot;Eastland&quot; more dangerous by making her even more top-heavy. Some argued that other Great Lakes ships would suffer from the same problem, but the bill was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson. &quot;Eastland&quot;″s owners could choose to either maintain a reduced capacity or add lifeboats to increase capacity, and they elected to add lifeboats to qualify for a license to increase the ship&#x27;s capacity to 2,570 passengers. &quot;Eastland&quot; was already so top-heavy that she had special restrictions concerning the number of passengers that could be carried. In June 1914, &quot;Eastland&quot; had again changed ownership, this time bought by the St. Joseph and Chicago Steamship Company, with captain Harry Pederson appointed the ship&#x27;s master. In 1914, the company removed the old hardwood flooring of the forward dining room on the cabin level and replaced it with of concrete. It also added a layer of concrete near the aft gangway. This added 15–20 tons of weight.
On the morning of 24 July, passengers began boarding &quot;Eastland&quot; on the south bank of the Chicago River between Clark and LaSalle Streets at about 6:30 a.m., and by 7:10 a.m., the ship had reached her capacity of 2,572 passengers. Many passengers were standing on the open upper decks when the ship began to list slightly to the port side (away from the wharf). The crew attempted to stabilize the ship by admitting water into her ballast tanks, but to little avail. At 7:28 a.m., &quot;Eastland&quot; lurched sharply to port and then rolled completely onto her port side, coming to rest on the river bottom, only below the surface; barely half of the vessel was submerged. Many passengers had already moved below decks on the cool and damp morning to warm themselves before the departure. Consequently, hundreds were trapped inside by the water and the sudden rollover, and some were crushed by heavy furniture, including pianos, bookcases, and tables. The ship was only from the wharf. Captain John O&#x27;Meara and the crew of the nearby vessel &quot;Kenosha&quot; responded quickly by pulling alongside the hull to allow stranded passengers to leap to safety. Other notable heroes of the day included Peter Boyle, a deckhand from the SS Petoskey who drowned saving passengers, and Helen Repa, a Western Electric nurse who commanded much of the rescue operation. However, 841 passengers and 2 crew members died. Many of the passengers on &quot;Eastland&quot; were immigrants, with large numbers from present-day Czech Republic, Poland, Norway, Germany, Ireland, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Hungary, and Austria. Many of the Czech immigrants had settled in Cicero; of the Czech passengers aboard, 220 perished in the disaster.

The bodies were taken to temporary morgues established in the area for identification; by afternoon, the remaining unidentified bodies were consolidated in the armory of the 2nd Regiment.

In the aftermath, the Western Electric Company provided $100,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to relief and recovery efforts of the family members of the victims.

Among those scheduled to be on &quot;Eastland&quot; was 20-year-old football player George Halas, later the coach and owner of the Chicago Bears and a founding member of the National Football League, who was delayed leaving for the dock and arrived after the ship had overturned. Halas&#x27;s name was listed on the list of deceased in newspapers, but he was later revealed to be unharmed. His friend and future Bears executive Ralph Brizzolara and his brother were on the &quot;Eastland&quot; when she capsized but escaped through portholes. Despite rumors to the contrary, entertainer Jack Benny was neither aboard &quot;Eastland&quot; nor scheduled for the excursion.

The first known film footage of the recovery efforts was discovered and released in 2015.

Marion Eichholz, the last known survivor, died on 24 November 2014 at the age of 102.

==== Media reports ====
Writer Jack Woodford witnessed the disaster and offered a first-hand account to the &quot;Herald and Examiner&quot;. In his autobiography, Woodford wrote:

Carl Sandburg, then known better as a journalist than as a poet, wrote an angry account for &quot;The International Socialist Review&quot;, accusing regulators of ignoring safety issues and claiming that many of the workers were aboard following company orders for a mandatory staged picnic. Sandburg also wrote a poem, &quot;The &quot;Eastland&quot;&quot;, which contrasted the disaster with the mistreatment and poor health of the lower classes. Sandburg concluded the poem with a comparison: &quot;I see a dozen &quot;Eastlands&quot;/Every morning on my way to work/And a dozen more going home at night.&quot; The poem was considered too harsh for publication when written, but was eventually published in a collection of poems in 1993.

==== Inquiry and indictments ====
A grand jury indicted the president and three other officers of the steamship company for manslaughter, and the ship&#x27;s captain and engineer for criminal carelessness, and found that the disaster was caused by &quot;conditions of instability&quot; caused by overloading of passengers, mishandling of water ballast and the ship&#x27;s faulty construction.

During hearings regarding the extradition of the men to Illinois for trial, principal witness Sidney Jenks, president of the company that built &quot;Eastland&quot;, testified that her first owners wanted a fast ship to transport fruit, and he designed one capable of reaching and carrying 500 passengers. Defense counsel Clarence Darrow asked whether Jenks had ever concerned himself with the potential conversion of the ship into a passenger steamer with a capacity of 2,500 or more passengers. Jenks replied, &quot;I had no way of knowing the quantity of its business after it left our yards ... No, I did not worry about the &quot;Eastland&quot;.&quot; Jenks testified that a stability test of the ship was never performed, and stated that after tilting to an angle of 45° at launching, &quot;it righted itself as straight as a church, satisfactorily demonstrating its stability.&quot;

The court refused extradition, holding that the evidence was too weak, with &quot;barely a scintilla of proof&quot; to establish probable cause to find the six guilty. The court reasoned that the four company officers were not aboard the ship, and that every act charged against the captain and engineer was performed in the ordinary course of business, &quot;more consistent with innocence than with guilt.&quot; The court also reasoned that &quot;Eastland&quot; &quot;was operated for years and carried thousands safely&quot;, and therefore the accused were justified in believing the ship to be seaworthy.

===Second life as USS &quot;Wilmette&quot;===

After &quot;Eastland&quot; was raised on 14 August 1915, she was sold to the Illinois Naval Reserve and recommissioned as USS &quot;Wilmette&quot;, stationed at the Naval Station Great Lakes. She was converted to a gunboat, renamed &quot;Wilmette&quot; on 20 February 1918, and commissioned on 20 September 1918 under captain William B. Wells. Commissioned late in World War I, &quot;Wilmette&quot; did not experience combat. It trained sailors and experienced normal upkeep and repairs until placed in ordinary at Chicago on 9 July 1919, retaining a 10-man caretaker crew aboard. On 29 June 1920, the gunboat was returned to full commission.

On 7 June 1921, &quot;Wilmette&quot; was tasked with sinking &quot;UC-97&quot;, a German U-boat surrendered to the United States after World War I. The guns of &quot;Wilmette&quot; were manned by gunner&#x27;s mate J. O. Sabin, who had fired the first American cannon of World War I, and gunner&#x27;s mate A. F. Anderson, the man who fired the first American torpedo of the war.

For the remainder of her 25-year career, the gunboat served as a training ship for naval reservists of the 9th, 10th and 11th Naval Districts. It made voyages along the shores of the Great Lakes carrying trainees assigned to her from the Naval Station Great Lakes. &quot;Wilmette&quot; was placed &quot;out of commission, in service&quot; on 15 February 1940.

Given hull designation IX-29 on 17 February 1941, she resumed training duty at Chicago on 30 March 1942, preparing armed guard crews for duty manning the guns on armed merchantmen. That assignment continued until the end of World War II in Europe obviated measures to protect transatlantic merchant shipping from German U-boats.

During August 1943, &quot;Wilmette&quot; transported President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Admiral William D. Leahy, James F. Byrnes and Harry Hopkins on a 10-day fishing vacation in McGregor and Whitefish Bay.

On 9 April 1945, she was returned to full commission for a brief interval. &quot;Wilmette&quot; was decommissioned on 28 November 1945, and her name was deleted from the Navy list on 19 December 1945. During 1946, &quot;Wilmette&quot; was offered for sale, but on 31 October 1946, she was sold to the Hyman Michaels Company for scrapping, which was completed in 1947.

==Memorials==

A marker commemorating the accident was dedicated on 4 June 1989. This marker was reported stolen on 26 April 2000, and a replacement marker was installed and dedicated on 24 July 2003.

, plans exist for a permanent outdoor exhibit with a proposed name of &quot;At The River&#x27;s Edge&quot;. This exhibit would be located along the portion of the Chicago Riverwalk adjacent to the site of the disaster and is planned to consist of panels with text and images.
On 12 July 2015, 100 years after the disaster, a memorial to the dead was dedicated at Bohemian National Cemetery in Chicago.

== In popular culture ==
The disaster was incorporated into the 1999 series premiere of the Disney Channel original series &quot;So Weird&quot;, in which teenage paranormal enthusiast Fiona Phillips encounters the ghost of a boy who drowned.

In 2012, Chicago&#x27;s Lookingglass Theatre produced a musical entitled &quot;Eastland: A New Musical&quot;, written by Andy White and scored by Ben Collins-Sussman and Andre Pluess.

The &quot;Eastland&quot; disaster is also pivotal to the story of one family told in the play/musical &quot;Failure: A Love Story&quot;, written by Philip Dawkins, which premiered in Chicago in 2012 at Victory Gardens Theater. The play premiered in Los Angeles on 24 July 2015, the 100th anniversary of the tragedy. The play was again staged in Chicago at the Oil Lamp Theater and was nominated for multiple awards.

In 2024, Chicago&#x27;s Neo-Futurists produced a puppetry show based on the disaster entitled &quot;Switchboard&quot;.

<text>[[Kassel]] (; in Germany, spelled Cassel until 1926) is a city on the Fulda River in northern Hesse, in central Germany. It is the administrative seat of the Regierungsbezirk Kassel and the district of the same name, and had 201,048 inhabitants in December 2020. The former capital of the state of Hesse-Kassel, it has many palaces and parks, including the Bergpark Wilhelmshöhe, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Kassel is also known for the &quot;documenta&quot; exhibitions of contemporary art. Kassel has a public university with 25,000 students (2018) and a multicultural population (39% of the citizens in 2017 had a migration background).

== History ==

Kassel was first mentioned in 913 AD, as the place where two deeds were signed by King Conrad I. The place was called &quot;Chasella&quot; or &quot;Chassalla&quot; and was a fortification at a bridge crossing the Fulda river. There are several yet unproven assumptions about the origin of the name. It could be derived from the ancient &quot;Castellum Cattorum&quot;, a castle of the Chatti, a German tribe that had lived in the area since Roman times. Another assumption is a portmanteau from Frankonian &quot;cas&quot;, meaning ‘valley’ or ‘recess’, and &quot;sali&quot; meaning ‘hall’ or ‘service building’, which can be interpreted as ‘(town) hall in a valley’.

A deed from 1189 certifies that Cassel had city rights, but the date when they were granted is not known.

The first castle in Kassel was constructed in 1277, later replaced by a Renaissance castle, the Kassel City Palace, which burned down in 1811.

In 1567 the Landgraviate of Hesse, until then centered in Marburg, was divided among four sons, with Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) becoming one of its successor states. Kassel was its capital and became a centre of Calvinist Protestantism in Germany. Strong fortifications were built to protect the Protestant stronghold against Catholic enemies. Secret societies, such as Rosicrucianism, flourished, with Christian Rosenkreutz&#x27;s work &quot;Fama Fraternitatis&quot; first published in 1617. In 1685 Kassel became a refuge for 1,700 Huguenots, who found shelter in the newly established borough of Oberneustadt. Landgrave Charles, who was responsible for this humanitarian act, also ordered the construction of the &quot;Oktogon&quot; (Hercules monument) and of the &quot;Orangerie&quot;. In the late 18th century Hesse-Kassel became infamous for selling mercenaries (Hessians) to the British crown to help suppress the American Revolution and to finance the construction of palaces and the Landgrave&#x27;s opulent lifestyle.

In the early 19th century the Brothers Grimm lived in Kassel. They collected and wrote most of their fairy tales there. At that time, around 1803, the Landgraviate was elevated to a Principality and its ruler to &quot;Prince-elector&quot;. Shortly after, it was annexed by Napoleon and in 1807 it became the capital of the short-lived Kingdom of Westphalia under Napoleon&#x27;s brother Jérôme. The Electorate was restored in 1813.

Having sided with Austria in the Austro-Prussian War to gain supremacy in Germany, the principality was annexed by Prussia in 1866. The Prussian administration united Nassau, Frankfurt and Hesse-Kassel into the new Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau. Kassel ceased to be a princely residence but soon developed into a major industrial centre as well as a major railway junction. Henschel &amp; Son, the largest railway locomotive manufacturer in Germany at the end of the nineteenth century, was based in Kassel.

In 1870, after the Battle of Sedan, Napoleon III was sent as a prisoner to the Wilhelmshöhe Palace above the city. During World War I the German military headquarters were located in the Wilhelmshöhe Palace. In the late 1930s, Nazis destroyed Heinrich Hübsch&#x27;s Kassel Synagogue.

During World War II Kassel was the headquarters for Germany&#x27;s Wehrkreis IX, and a local subcamp of Dachau concentration camp provided forced labour for the Henschel facilities, which included tank production plants. There was also a camp for Sinti and Romani people (see &quot;Romani Holocaust&quot;). Allied prisoners of war from the Stalag IX-A POW camp were deployed to forced labour in the local arms industry in violation of the Geneva Conventions. The most severe bombing of Kassel in World War II destroyed 90% of the downtown area, and some 10,000 people were killed and 150,000 were made homeless. Most of the casualties were civilians or wounded soldiers recuperating in local hospitals, whereas factories survived the attack generally undamaged. Karl Gerland replaced the regional Gauleiter, Karl Weinrich, soon after the raid.

The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Kassel at the beginning of April 1945. The US 80th Infantry Division captured Kassel in bitter house-to-house fighting during 1–4 April 1945, which included numerous German panzer-grenadier counterattacks, and resulted in further widespread devastation to bombed and unbombed structures alike.

Post-war, most of the ancient buildings in the city centre were not restored, and large parts of the inner city area were completely rebuilt in the style of the 1950s. A few historic buildings, however, such as the Museum Fridericianum (see below), were restored. In 1949, the interim parliament (&quot;Parlamentarischer Rat&quot;) eliminated Kassel in the first round as a city to become the provisional capital of the Federal Republic of Germany (Bonn won). In 1964, the town hosted the fourth &quot;Hessentag&quot; state festival (again in 2013). In 1972 the Chancellor of West Germany Willy Brandt and the prime minister of the German Democratic Republic Willy Stoph met in Wilhelmshöhe Palace for negotiations between the two German states. In 1991, the central rail station moved from &quot;Hauptbahnhof&quot; (&quot;main station&quot;) (today only used for regional trains) to &quot;Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe&quot;. The city had a dynamic economic and social development in the recent years, reducing the unemployment rate by half and attracting many new citizens so that the population has grown constantly.

== Economy ==
Several international operating companies have factories or headquarters in the city (Volkswagen, Mercedes Benz, SMA, Wintershall, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, Rheinmetall, Bombardier). The city is home of several hospitals; the public Klinikum Kassel is one of the largest hospitals in the federal state, offering a wide range of health services.
==Geography==
Kassel is the largest city in the north of the federated state of Hesse in the south-western part of Germany, about 70 kilometers northwest of the geographic center of Germany.

It is located on both sides of the river Fulda. Kassel&#x27;s deepest point is in the north-eastern Fulda valley at 132.9 m above sea level.

The urban area of Kassel is divided into 23 local districts, each of which has a local council with a local mayor as chairman. The local councils are elected every five years by the population of the local districts. The local advisory board can be heard on all important issues affecting the local district. However, the final decision on a measure rests with the Kassel city council.

===Neighboring communities===
Around Kassel is the administrative district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) of Landkreis Kassel. The following cities and municipalities border the city of Kassel (starting clockwise in the north): Ahnatal, Vellmar, Fuldatal, Staufenberg, Niestetal, Kaufungen, Lohfelden, Fuldabrück, Baunatal, Schauenburg, Habichtswald. Of these, Vellmar and Fuldatal in the north, Kaufungen in the east, Lohfelden in the southeast and Baunatal in the south are growing ever closer to the urban area.

==Culture==

In 1558 the first German observatory was built in Kassel, and a later version from 1714 survives as the Bellevue Palace. The &quot;Ottoneum&quot;, the first permanent German theatre building, was built in 1604. The old building is today the Natural History Museum, and the now-called Staatstheater Kassel is located in a nearby building that was constructed in the 1950s. 
Since 1927 Kassel has been home to Bärenreiter, one of the world&#x27;s most important music publishers.

Since 1955 the &quot;documenta&quot;, an international exhibition of modern and contemporary art, has been held regularly in Kassel. The &quot;documenta&quot; now takes place every five years. As a result of the &quot;documenta 6&quot; (1977), Kassel became the first town in the world to be illuminated by laser beams at night (Laserscape, by artist Horst H. Baumann). This laser installation is nowadays still visible at weekends. Artworks from former editions of the &quot;documenta&quot; (mainly sculptures) can be found in many places in Kassel; among those are the &quot;7000 Oaks&quot;, a work of land art by the German artist Joseph Beuys. The latest/current edition of the &quot;documenta&quot;, known as &quot;documenta 15&quot;, runs from 18 June until 25 September 2022.

== Climate ==
Kassel experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) but not so far from marine climates, with a more notable continental influence than Berlin. Using the 1961–1990 normal and 0 °C isotherm, the city already had a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;).
==Demographics==
Kassel has a population of about 200,000 and is the 3rd largest city in Hesse state and the only large city in the North Hesse region. Kassel is often called the city that located on the center of Germany, due to its position; however, the real center of Germany is not far away. Kassel first reached its first population peak of over 100,000 in 1899 and its second in 1943 with about 225,000. Kassel was destroyed during World War II and became an industrial city in 1950s. Today, Kassel is home to a few companies and universities.

== Sights ==

The bombing raids of 1943 destroyed 90% of the city center. The city center was almost completely rebuilt during the 1950s and is a combination of renovated or reconstructed old buildings and architecture of the 1950s. Outside the city center, the suburbs are dominated by 19th-century architecture. Timber-framed old towns are situated in suburbs like Harleshausen and Bad Wilhelmshöhe. The oldest monument is the Druselturm; the Brüderkirche and the Martinskirche are also, in part, of medieval origin. The towers of the Martinskirche are from the 1950s.

=== Churches ===

==== St. Martin, Kassel ====
The main Protestant church of Kassel, it was begun in 1364 and finished in 1462. Severely damaged by British bombing in 1943, it was later reconstructed in a more modern style between 1954 and 1958.

==== St. Bonifatius, Kassel ====
St. Bonifatius was designed and built in 1956 by Josef Bieling.

===Bergpark Wilhelmshöhe===
The complex includes Wilhelmshöhe Palace (with the Antiquities Collection and Old Masters), the Hercules monument, and the Lions Castle.
Wilhelmshöhe Palace above the city was built in 1786, by landgrave Wilhelm IX of Hesse-Kassel. The palace is now a museum and houses an important collection of Graeco-Roman antiques and a fine gallery of paintings comprising the second largest collection of Rembrandts in Germany. It is surrounded by the beautiful Bergpark Wilhelmshöhe with many appealing sights. The complex was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013.
The Hercules monument is a huge octagonal stone structure carrying a giant replica of Hercules &quot;Farnese&quot; (now at Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples, Italy). From its base down to Wilhelmshöhe Palace runs a long set of artificial cascades which delight visitors during the summer months. Every Sunday and Wednesday afternoon at 14:30 (from May until October) the famous water features take place. They start at the Oktagon and during a one-hour walk through the park visitors can follow the water&#x27;s way until they reach the lake of the Wilhelmshöhe Palace, where a fountain of about marks the end of the spectacle.

The &quot;Löwenburg&quot; (&quot;Lions Castle&quot;) is a replica of a medieval castle, also built during the reign of Wilhelm IX. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 Napoléon III was imprisoned in Wilhelmshöhe. In 1918, Wilhelmshöhe became the seat of the German Army High Command (OHL): it was there that the military commanders Hindenburg and Ludendorff prepared the German capitulation.

===Staatspark Karlsaue (Karlsaue Park)===
Another large park and also part of the European Garden Heritage Network is the Karlsaue along the Fulda River. Established in the 16th century, it is famous for the Orangerie, a palace built in 1710 as a summer residence for the landgraves. Today, the Orangerie contains the Museum of Astronomy and Technology, with a scale model of the Solar System spanning the entire park and beyond. 
In addition, the Park Schönfeld contains a small, municipal botanical garden, the Botanischer Garten Kassel.

===Art museums===
Europe&#x27;s first public museum, the Museum Fridericianum was founded in 1779. By the end of the 19th century the museum held one of the largest collections of watches and clocks in the world.
Other art museums in Kassel include: 
* Wilhelmshöhe Palace (Antiquities Collection and Old Masters: Albrecht Dürer, Rubens, Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Anthony van Dyck)
* New Gallery (Tischbein family, Joseph Beuys)
* Hessisches Landesmuseum (with a world-famous wallpaper collection).

===Other museums===
* Museum of Natural History (in the Ottoneum building)
* Museum of physics and astronomy in the Orangerie
* Marmorbad (marble bath) in the Orangerie
* Caricatura (in the Hauptbahnhof Kassel)
* Museum of Local History
* Tram Museum Kassel
* Technical Museum and Henschel Museum
* Louis Spohr Museum (classical music composer) Museum in the Bellevue Palace, remaining part of the Bellevueschloss palace complex

* Museum of the Brothers Grimm (known as Grimmwelt Kassel)
* Museum of Modern Art (Neue Gallerie)
* Gemäldegallerie Kassel in the Wilhelmshöhe Palace (Schloss Wilhelmshöhe)

==Sports==
Hessen Kassel is the football club in the city, who plays in the Hessenliga after being relegated from the Regionalliga Südwest in the 2017/2018 season. The city&#x27;s own football stadium, the Auestadion was built in 1953 and is able to hold 18,737 people. It is located in the south of Kassel at the quarter Südstadt, next to the Karlsaue.

Kassel has a long ice hockey tradition, but it was not until 1977 that the Kassel ice rink (Eissporthalle) opened on a private initiative. The Kassel Huskies were founding members of the DEL in 1994, belonging to the league from 1994 to 2006 and again from 2008 to 2010. In 1997, they were runners-up in the championship playoffs, losing to Adler Mannheim, and reached the semi-finals on three more occasions. The Huskies ran into financial difficulties and dissolved in 2010. The &quot;Young Huskies&quot;, which is a junior and youth hockey club, decided to enter a men&#x27;s team in the Hessenliga. This is the fifth division and the lowest men&#x27;s competition in the state of Hesse. The new club was expecting no more than 3,000 supporters for the first home game in the Hessenliga. However, they had over 5,000 supporters come to watch.

== Transport ==

Kassel has seven tram lines (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), with trams arriving usually every 15 minutes. The city also operates a light rail Stadtbahn network called &quot;RegioTram&quot; using Regio Citadis low-floor trams which run on both tram and main line railway tracks with three lines (RT1, RT4, RT5). Moreover, a number of low-floor buses complete the Kassel public transport system. The introduction of low-floor buses led to the development of the Kassel kerb which improves the accessibility at bus stops.

The city is connected to the national rail network at two stations, Kassel Central, and Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe. The traditional central station (Hauptbahnhof) has been reduced to the status of a regional station since the opening of the Hanover-Würzburg high-speed rail line in 1991 and its station (Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe) on the high-speed line at which the InterCityExpress (ICE) and InterCity services call as well as Nightjet and Flixtrain.

Kassel is connected to the motorways A 7, A 49 and A 44.

The city is served by Kassel Calden Airport.

== Politics ==
=== Mayor ===
The current mayor of Kassel is Sven Schoeller of Alliance 90/The Greens, who was elected in March 2023. He succeeded Christian Geselle (SPD), who had been in office since 2017.

===City council===

The Kassel city council (&quot;Stadtverordnetenversammlung&quot;) governs the city alongside the Mayor. The most recent city council election was held on 14 March 2021, and the results were as follows:

<text>The [[Paddle steamer|PS]] &quot;Lady Elgin&quot; was a wooden-hulled sidewheel steamship that sank in Lake Michigan off the fledgling town of Port Clinton, Illinois, whose geography is now divided between Highland Park and Highwood, Illinois, after she was rammed in a gale by the schooner &quot;Augusta&quot; in the early hours of September 8, 1860. The passenger manifest was lost with the collision, but the sinking of &quot;Lady Elgin&quot; resulted in the loss of about 300 lives in what was called &quot;one of the greatest marine horrors on record&quot;. Four years after the disaster, a new rule required sailing vessels to carry running lights. The &quot;Lady Elgin&quot; disaster remains the greatest loss of life on open water in the history of the Great Lakes.

In 1994, a process began to list the shipwreck on the National Register of Historic Places. After it was determined to be eligible for listing in 1999, the process ended after an objection by the owner, so the shipwreck is not listed on the Register.

==Career==

&quot;Lady Elgin&quot; was built in 1851 in Buffalo, New York, at a cost of $95,000. She was named after the wife of Lord Elgin, Canada&#x27;s Governor General from 1847 to 1854. During her time, the wooden-hulled sidewheeler was one of the most elegantly appointed passenger ships plying the Great Lakes. Rated a first-class steamer, she was a favorite with the traveling public. Early in her career she ran between Buffalo and Chicago, then later between Chicago and Collingwood, Ontario. For many of her later seasons, she plied the route between Chicago and other Lake Michigan ports and Lake Superior.

During &quot;Lady Elgin&quot;″s career she was involved in numerous accidents. She sank and was repaired in 1854 after striking a rock at Manitowoc, Wisconsin. In 1855, she was towed to Chicago after an accident to her machinery. In 1857, she was damaged by fire. In June 1858, she struck a reef at Copper Harbor, Michigan. In August 1858, she was stranded on Au Sable Point Reef in Lake Superior. In October 1859, she was towed to Marquette, Michigan after breaking her crossbeam. In November 1859, she was towed again when her crank pin broke near Point Iroquois, Michigan. Her final blow came in 1860 when she was rammed by the wooden schooner &quot;Augusta&quot; ten miles from shore. In 1899, Great Lakes historian J.B. Mansfield called &quot;Lady Elgin&quot;s sinking &quot;one of the greatest marine horrors on record&quot;.

==Final voyage==

On the morning of September 6, 1860 &quot;Lady Elgin&quot; left Milwaukee, Wisconsin, from the Dooley, Martin, Dousman, and Company Dock, for Chicago, carrying members of Milwaukee&#x27;s Union Guard to hear a campaign speech by Stephen A. Douglas, Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s opponent, although there is no clear historical evidence that Douglas actually appeared. The passengers spent the day of September 7 listening to political speeches followed by an evening of entertainment by a German brass band on board &quot;Lady Elgin&quot;. On the return trip to Chicago that night, the brightly lit &quot;Lady Elgin&quot; was steaming through Lake Michigan against gale force winds when she was rammed by the schooner &quot;Augusta of Oswego&quot;. &quot;Augusta&quot; was sailing using only a single white light, mounted on a five-foot Samson on the bow, and did not attempt, or was unable, to turn to avoid the collision in the gale. On the morning of the collision (September 8) at 2:30 am, &quot;Augusta&quot; rammed the port side of &quot;Lady Elgin&quot;, damaging her own bowsprit and headgear, while holing the latter ship below the waterline.

Concerned that she was damaged and believing &quot;Lady Elgin&quot; had got safely away, &quot;Augusta&quot; made for Chicago. Aboard &quot;Lady Elgin&quot;, Captain Wilson ordered that cattle and cargo be thrown overboard to lighten the load and raise the gaping hole in &quot;Lady Elgin&#x27;s&quot; port side above water level while the steward was down in the coal bunker trying to stop the leak with mattresses. Captain Wilson ordered a lifeboat lowered on the starboard side to check the extent of the damage but it never regained the steamer. Within twenty minutes, &quot;Lady Elgin&quot; broke apart, and all but the bow section rapidly sank. The night was lit up at intervals by flashes of lightning showing the scattered wreckage.

The life preservers, hardwood planks, long and wide, were never used. Two boats with a total of 18 persons reached shore. In addition, fourteen people were saved on a large raft and many others on parts of the wreckage. Over 300 people died and 98 saved. The drummer of the German band, Charles Beverung, saved himself by using his large bass drum as a life preserver. Survivors reported the heroic efforts of Captain Wilson to save about 300 persons collected on a raft. When day broke, between 350 and 400 passengers and crew were drifting in stormy waters, holding on to anything they could, many only to be pulled under by breakers near shore.

Students from Northwestern University and Garrett Biblical Institute were watching the shore on the morning of September 8, looking for survivors. One of the students, Edward Spencer, is credited with rescuing 17 passengers over the course of six hours. He sustained injuries during his rescue efforts that left him an invalid for the rest of his life. A plaque in his honor was first placed in the Northwestern University Gymnasium, and is now housed in the Northwestern University Library.

About 300 people died in the sinking, including Captain Wilson, who was lost trying to save two women when he was caught by the surf and forced into the rocks. Most were from Milwaukee with the majority of those from the Irish communities, including nearly all of Milwaukee&#x27;s Irish Union Guard. So many Irish-American political operatives died that day that the disaster has been credited with transferring the balance of political power in Milwaukee &quot;from the Irish to the Germans&quot;. It is said that more than 1000 children were orphaned by the tragedy, however research shows that there were fewer than 40 children orphaned. The &quot;Lady Elgin&quot; disaster remains the greatest loss of life on open water in the history of the Great Lakes.

==Memorials==

A Wisconsin historical marker in the historic third ward in Milwaukee commemorates the tragedy. Calvary Cemetery in Milwaukee has a monument dedicated to the &quot;Lady Elgin&quot; disaster and the many lost in the tragedy who are buried there. 

Songwriter Henry Clay Work penned the memorial song &quot;Lost on the Lady Elgin&quot; in 1861. For many years in central Canada this song was sung at family gatherings and social occasions. 

In 2009, the Milwaukee Irish Heritage and Cultural Center launched a $200,000 fundraising campaign for a mammoth, two-story bronze memorial statue for the &quot;Lady Elgin&quot; disaster.

==Maritime rulings==
Following the sinking, &quot;Lady Elgin&#x27;s&quot; owner, Gurdon Saltonstall Hubbard, received a $12,000 payment from his insurance company, but neither he nor the insurance company accepted abandonment of the ship. The captain of &quot;Augusta&quot;, Darius Malott, was arrested and tried in Chicago, but found not guilty of navigational negligence. A coroner&#x27;s jury declared his second-mate, Mr. Budge, to be incompetent, and his crew to be of principal blame. However, Professor Mason and Lieutenant Bartlett asserted that a principal cause of the collision was the lack of a $15 lantern on the Augusta. Steamboat historian Peter Charlebois noted that, after the investigation, Captain Malott and &quot;Lady Elgin&#x27;s&quot; crew and owners were absolved of any blame. He reported: The judgement was based on a law that not only gave sail the right of way over steam, but did not require sailing vessels to carry running lights. Apparently &quot;Augusta&quot; had sighted the passenger steamer twenty minutes before the collision but in the rain had misjudged the distance between them. Four years after the disaster, in 1864, a new ruling was made requiring sailing vessels to carry running lights. Since there were still nearly 1,900 ships under sail by 1870 the regulations were long overdue. 

==Wreck==
The wreck of &quot;Lady Elgin&quot; was discovered in 1989 off Highwood, Illinois by Harry Zych. Zych was awarded ownership in 1999 after a protracted legal battle. The wreck, consisting of four main debris fields lying in of water, has been stripped of artifacts through the years. Divers must obtain permission from Zych and &quot;Lady Elgin&quot; Foundation, and are expected to observe the preservation laws governing historic sites. The Underwater Archaeological Society of Chicago undertook a reconnaissance survey of the wreck site in 1992.

<doc id="42112" wikidata="Q132231" url="?curid=42112" title="Yersinia">
<text>Yersinia is a genus of bacteria in the family Yersiniaceae. &quot;Yersinia&quot; species are Gram-negative, coccobacilli bacteria, a few micrometers long and fractions of a micrometer in diameter, and are facultative anaerobes. Some members of &quot;Yersinia&quot; are pathogenic in humans; in particular, &quot;Y. pestis&quot; is the causative agent of the plague. Rodents are the natural reservoirs of &quot;Yersinia&quot;; less frequently, other mammals serve as the host. Infection may occur either through blood (in the case of &quot;Y. pestis&quot;) or in an alimentary fashion, occasionally via consumption of food products (especially vegetables, milk-derived products, and meat) contaminated with infected urine or feces.

Speculations exist as to whether or not certain &quot;Yersinia&quot; can also be spread by protozoonotic mechanisms, since &quot;Yersinia&quot; species are known to be facultative intracellular parasites; currently, there are studies and discussions of the possibility of amoeba-vectored (through the cyst form of the protozoan) &quot;Yersinia&quot; propagation and proliferation.

==Microbial physiology==
An interesting feature peculiar to some of the &quot;Yersinia&quot; bacteria is the ability to not only survive, but also to actively proliferate at temperatures as low as 1–4 °C (e.g., on cut salads and other food products in a refrigerator). &quot;Yersinia&quot; bacteria are relatively quickly inactivated by oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide and potassium permanganate solutions.

==Genetics==
===Database===
The creation of YersiniaBase, a data and tools collection for the reporting and comparison of &quot;Yersinia&quot; species genome sequence data, was reported in January 2015. The provisional representation of species addressed by the resource has been indicated in the TaxBox on this page by a superscript &#x27;yb&#x27; beside the species name. Development of YersiniaBase was funded by the University of Malaya and the Ministry of Education, Malaysia.

==Pathogenesis==
&quot;Y. pestis&quot; is the causative agent of plague. The disease caused by &quot;Y. enterocolitica&quot; is called yersiniosis.

&quot;Yersinia&quot; may be associated with Crohn&#x27;s disease, an inflammatory autoimmune condition of the gut. Iranian people with Crohn&#x27;s disease were more likely to have had earlier exposure to refrigerators at home, consistent with its unusual ability to thrive at low temperatures.

&quot;Yersinia&quot; is implicated as one of the causes of reactive arthritis worldwide.

Also, the genus is associated with pseudoappendicitis, which is an incorrect diagnosis of appendicitis due to a similar presentation.

==History==
&quot;Y. pestis&quot;, the first known species, was identified in 1894 by A.E.J. Yersin, a Swiss bacteriologist, and Kitasato Shibasaburō, a Japanese bacteriologist. It was formerly described as &quot;Pasteurella pestis&quot; (known trivially as the plague-bacillus) by Lehmann and Neumann in 1896. In 1944, van Loghem reclassified the species &quot;P. pestis&quot; and &quot;P. rondentium&quot; into a new genus, &quot;Yersinia&quot;. Following the introduction of the bacteriological code, it was accepted as valid in 1980.

<doc id="42113" wikidata="Q3151449" url="?curid=42113" title="Chicago flood">
<text>The Chicago flood occurred on April 13, 1992, when repair work on a bridge spanning the Chicago River damaged the wall of an abandoned and disused utility tunnel beneath the river. The resulting breach flooded basements, facilities and the underground Chicago Pedway throughout the Chicago Loop with an estimated of water.
The remediation lasted for weeks, and cost about $2 billion in 1992 dollars, equivalent to $ in . The legal battles lasted for several years, and disagreement over who was at fault persists to this day.

==Cause==

Rehabilitation work on the Kinzie Street Bridge crossing the Chicago River required new pilings. However, when the City of Chicago specified that the old pilings be extracted and replaced by the new ones, the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company reported back that the old pilings were too close to the bridge tender&#x27;s house, preventing proper removal without risking damaging or destroying the house. The City of Chicago then gave permission to install the new pilings south of the old pilings. The crew members who began work at the site did not know that beneath the river was an abandoned Chicago Tunnel Company (CTC) tunnel that had been used in the early 20th century to transport coal and goods. One of the pilings on the east bank was driven into the bottom of the river alongside the north wall of the old tunnel. The pilings did not punch through the tunnel wall, but clay soil displaced by the piling eventually breached the wall, allowing sediment and water to seep into the tunnel. After some weeks, most of the clay between the water and the breach had liquefied, which rapidly increased the rate of flooding in the tunnel. The situation became problematic because the flood doors had been removed from the old tunnels after they fell into disuse.

== Discovery of the leak ==
A skilled telecommunications worker inspecting a cable running through the tunnel discovered the leak while it was still passing mud and forwarded a videotape to the city, which did not see anything serious and began a bid process to repair the tunnel. The CTC tunnels were never formally a public responsibility, as most of them had been dug clandestinely, many violated private property and the collapse of the operator had failed to resolve ownership and maintenance responsibilities. Meanwhile, the mud continued to push through until the river water was able to pour in unabated, creating an immediate emergency.

==Effects==
The water flooded into the basements of several Loop office buildings and retail stores and an underground shopping district. The Loop and financial district were evacuated, and electrical power and gas were interrupted in most of the area as a precaution. Trading at the Chicago Board of Trade Building and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ended in mid-morning as water seeped into their basements. At its height, some buildings had of water in their lower levels. However, at the street level there was no water to be seen, as it was all underground.

At first, the source of the water was unclear. WMAQ radio reporter Larry Langford reported that city crews were in the process of shutting down large water mains to see if the water flow could be stopped.
Monitoring police scanners, Langford heard security crews from Chicago&#x27;s Merchandise Mart (near the Kinzie Street Bridge) report that the water in their basement had fish. Langford drove to the Merchandise Mart, then reported over the air that water was swirling near a piling in a manner similar to water going down a bathtub drain. Within minutes emergency services were converging on the bridge.

==Repair and cleanup==
Workers attempted to plug the hole, by then about wide, with 65 truckloads of rocks, cement and old mattresses. In an attempt to slow the leak, the level of the Chicago River was lowered by opening the locks downstream of Chicago, and the freight tunnels were drained into the Chicago Deep Tunnel system. The leak was eventually stopped by placing a specialized concrete mixture supplied by Material Service Corporation (MSC) and placed by Kenny Construction. The concrete was designed by Brian Rice of MSC and was to set up so quickly that the concrete delivery trucks were provided police escorts. The concrete was placed into drilled shafts into the flooded tunnel near Kinzie Street and formed emergency plugs.

==Aftermath==
It took three days before the flood was cleaned up enough to allow business to begin to resume and cost the city an estimated $1.95 billion (equivalent to $ in ). Some buildings remained closed for a few weeks. Parking was banned downtown during the cleanup and some subway routes were temporarily closed or rerouted. Since it occurred near Tax Day, the IRS granted natural disaster extensions to those affected.

Eventually, the city assumed maintenance responsibility for the tunnels, and watertight hatches were installed at the river crossings. Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Co. sued the City of Chicago arguing that the city had failed to tell it about the existence of the tunnels. 
Insurance battles lasted for years, the central point being the definition of the accident, i.e., whether it was a &quot;flood&quot; or a &quot;leak&quot;. Leaks were covered by insurance, while floods were not. Eventually it was classified as a leak, which is why many residents still call it the &quot;Great Chicago Leak&quot;.

Today, there remains contention as to whether the mistake was the fault of the workers on-site, their parent company, or even the claim that maps provided by the City of Chicago failed to accurately depict the old tunnel systems. In fact, the Kinzie Street river crossing was clearly delineated on the city maps: the typical tunnel ran down the center of the old streets. At Kinzie Street, like some of the other river crossings, it veered off to the side as the historic Kinzie bridge (at the time of the tunnel construction) was a pivoting bridge with a central pivot in the middle of the street. Thus the original tunnels were moved to the side, as were several other bridges across the Chicago River—shown in detail on the city maps.

==Court cases==
In the lawsuits that followed, Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Co. was initially found liable but was later cleared after it was revealed that the city was aware the tunnel was leaking before the flood and the city had also not properly maintained the tunnel.

In addition the case went to the United States Supreme Court in which ruled that since the work was being done by a vessel in navigable waters of the Chicago River, admiralty law applied and Great Lakes&#x27;s liability was greatly limited.

<doc id="42114" wikidata="Q150839" url="?curid=42114" title="Salmonella">
<text>Salmonella is a genus of rod-shaped, (bacillus) Gram-negative bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The two known species of &quot;Salmonella&quot; are &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; and &quot;Salmonella bongori&quot;. &quot;S. enterica&quot; is the type species and is further divided into six subspecies that include over 2,650 serotypes. &quot;Salmonella&quot; was named after Daniel Elmer Salmon (1850–1914), an American veterinary surgeon.

&quot;Salmonella&quot; species are non-spore-forming, predominantly motile enterobacteria with cell diameters between about 0.7 and 1.5 μm, lengths from 2 to 5 μm, and peritrichous flagella (all around the cell body, allowing them to move). They are chemotrophs, obtaining their energy from oxidation and reduction reactions, using organic sources. They are also facultative anaerobes, capable of generating adenosine triphosphate with oxygen (&quot;aerobically&quot;) when it is available, or using other electron acceptors or fermentation (&quot;anaerobically&quot;) when oxygen is not available.

&quot;Salmonella&quot; species are intracellular pathogens, of which certain serotypes cause illness such as salmonellosis. Most infections are due to the ingestion of food contaminated by feces. Typhoidal &quot;Salmonella&quot; serotypes can only be transferred between humans and can cause foodborne illness as well as typhoid and paratyphoid fever. Typhoid fever is caused by typhoidal &quot;Salmonella&quot; invading the bloodstream, as well as spreading throughout the body, invading organs, and secreting endotoxins (the septic form). This can lead to life-threatening hypovolemic shock and septic shock, and requires intensive care, including antibiotics.

Nontyphoidal &quot;Salmonella&quot; serotypes are zoonotic and can be transferred from animals and between humans. They usually invade only the gastrointestinal tract and cause salmonellosis, the symptoms of which can be resolved without antibiotics. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, nontyphoidal &quot;Salmonella&quot; can be invasive and cause paratyphoid fever, which requires immediate antibiotic treatment.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Salmonella&quot; is part of the family of Enterobacteriaceae. Its taxonomy has been revised and has the potential to confuse. The genus comprises two species, &quot;S. bongori&quot; and &quot;S. enterica&quot;, the latter of which is divided into six subspecies: &quot;S. e. enterica&quot;, &quot;S. e. salamae&quot;, &quot;S. e. arizonae&quot;, &quot;S. e. diarizonae&quot;, &quot;S. e. houtenae&quot;, and &quot;S. e. indica&quot;. The taxonomic group contains more than 2500 serotypes (also serovars) defined on the basis of the somatic O (lipopolysaccharide) and flagellar H antigens (the Kauffman–White classification). The full name of a serotype is given as, for example, &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; subsp. &quot;enterica&quot; serotype Typhimurium, but can be abbreviated to &quot;Salmonella&quot; Typhimurium. Further differentiation of strains to assist clinical and epidemiological investigation may be achieved by antibiotic sensitivity testing and by other molecular biology techniques such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multilocus sequence typing, and, increasingly, whole genome sequencing. Historically, salmonellae have been clinically categorized as invasive (typhoidal) or non-invasive (nontyphoidal salmonellae) based on host preference and disease manifestations in humans.

== History ==
&quot;Salmonella&quot; was first visualized in 1880 by Karl Eberth in the Peyer&#x27;s patches and spleens of typhoid patients. Four years later, Georg Theodor Gaffky was able to grow the pathogen in pure culture. A year after that, medical research scientist Theobald Smith discovered what would be later known as &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; (var. Choleraesuis). At the time, Smith was working as a research laboratory assistant in the Veterinary Division of the United States Department of Agriculture. The division was under the administration of Daniel Elmer Salmon, a veterinary pathologist. Initially, &quot;Salmonella&quot; Choleraesuis was thought to be the causative agent of hog cholera, so Salmon and Smith named it &quot;Hog-cholera bacillus&quot;. The name &quot;Salmonella&quot; was not used until 1900, when Joseph Leon Lignières proposed that the pathogen discovered by Salmon&#x27;s group be called &quot;Salmonella&quot; in his honor.

In the late 1930s, Australian bacteriologist Nancy Atkinson established a salmonella typing laboratory – one of only three in the world at the time – at the Government of South Australia&#x27;s Laboratory of Pathology and Bacteriology in Adelaide (later the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science). It was here that Atkinson described multiple new strains of salmonella, including Salmonella Adelaide, which was isolated in 1943. Atkinson published her work on salmonellas in 1957.

== Serotyping ==
Serotyping is done by mixing cells with antibodies for a particular antigen. It can give some idea about risk. A 2014 study showed that &quot;S.&quot; Reading is very common among young turkey samples, but it is not a significant contributor to human salmonellosis. Serotyping can assist in identifying the source of contamination by matching serotypes in people with serotypes in the suspected source of infection. Appropriate prophylactic treatment can be identified from the known antibiotic resistance of the serotype.

Newer methods of &quot;serotyping&quot; include xMAP and real-time PCR, two methods based on DNA sequences instead of antibody reactions. These methods can be potentially faster, thanks to advances in sequencing technology. These &quot;molecular serotyping&quot; systems actually perform genotyping of the genes that determine surface antigens.

== Detection, culture, and growth conditions ==

Most subspecies of &quot;Salmonella&quot; produce hydrogen sulfide, which can readily be detected by growing them on media containing ferrous sulfate, such as is used in the triple sugar iron test. Most isolates exist in two phases, a motile phase and a non-motile phase. Cultures that are nonmotile upon primary culture may be switched to the motile phase using a Craigie tube or ditch plate. RVS broth can be used to enrich for &quot;Salmonella&quot; species for detection in a clinical sample.

&quot;Salmonella&quot; can also be detected and subtyped using multiplex or real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) from extracted &quot;Salmonella&quot; DNA.

Mathematical models of &quot;Salmonella&quot; growth kinetics have been developed for chicken, pork, tomatoes, and melons. &quot;Salmonella&quot; reproduce asexually with a cell division interval of 40 minutes.

&quot;Salmonella&quot; species lead predominantly host-associated lifestyles, but the bacteria were found to be able to persist in a bathroom setting for weeks following contamination, and are frequently isolated from water sources, which act as bacterial reservoirs and may help to facilitate transmission between hosts. &quot;Salmonella&quot; is notorious for its ability to survive desiccation and can persist for years in dry environments and foods.

The bacteria are not destroyed by freezing, but UV light and heat accelerate their destruction. They perish after being heated to for 90 min, or to for 12 min, although if inoculated in high fat, high liquid substances like peanut butter, they gain heat resistance and can survive up to for 30 min. To protect against &quot;Salmonella&quot; infection, heating food to an internal temperature of is recommended.

&quot;Salmonella&quot; species can be found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, especially reptiles. &quot;Salmonella&quot; on the skin of reptiles or amphibians can be passed to people who handle the animals. Food and water can also be contaminated with the bacteria if they come in contact with the feces of infected people or animals.

== Nomenclature ==

Initially, each &quot;Salmonella&quot; &quot;species&quot; was named according to clinical consideration, for example &quot;Salmonella typhi-murium&quot; (mouse-typhoid), &quot;S. cholerae-suis&quot; (pig-cholera). After host specificity was recognized not to exist for many species, new strains received species names according to the location at which the new strain was isolated.

In 1987, Le Minor and Popoff used molecular findings to argue that &quot;Salmonella&quot; consisted of only one species, &quot;S. enterica&quot;, turning former &quot;species&quot; names into serotypes. In 1989, Reeves &quot;et al.&quot; proposed that the serotype V should remain its own species, resurrecting the name &quot;S. bongori&quot;. The current (by 2005) nomenclature has thus taken shape, with six recognised subspecies under &quot;S. enterica&quot;: &quot;enterica&quot; (serotype I), &quot;salamae&quot; (serotype II), &quot;arizonae&quot; (IIIa), &quot;diarizonae&quot; (IIIb), &quot;houtenae&quot; (IV), and &quot;indica&quot; (VI). As specialists in infectious disease are not familiar with the new nomenclature, the traditional nomenclature remains common.

The serotype or serovar is a classification of &quot;Salmonella&quot; based on antigens that the organism presents. The Kauffman–White classification scheme differentiates serological varieties from each other. Serotypes are usually put into subspecies groups after the genus and species, with the serotypes/serovars capitalized, but not italicized: An example is &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; serovar Typhimurium. More modern approaches for typing and subtyping &quot;Salmonella&quot; include DNA-based methods such as pulsed field gel electrophoresis, multiple-loci VNTR analysis, multilocus sequence typing, and multiplex-PCR-based methods.

In 2005, a third species, &quot;Salmonella subterranea&quot;, was proposed, but according to the World Health Organization, the bacterium reported does not belong in the genus &quot;Salmonella&quot;. In 2016, &quot;S. subterranea&quot; was proposed to be assigned to &quot;Atlantibacter subterranea&quot;, but LPSN rejects it as an invalid publication, as it was made outside of IJSB and IJSEM. GTDB and NCBI agree with the 2016 reassignment.

GTDB RS202 reports that &quot;S. arizonae&quot;, &quot;S. diarizonae&quot;, and &quot;S. houtenae&quot; should be species of their own.

== Pathogenicity ==
&quot;Salmonella&quot; species are facultative intracellular pathogens. &quot;Salmonella&quot; can invade different cell types, including epithelial cells, M cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. As facultative anaerobic organism, &quot;Salmonella&quot; uses oxygen to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in aerobic environments (i.e., when oxygen is available). However, in anaerobic environments (i.e., when oxygen is not available) &quot;Salmonella&quot; produces ATP by fermentation — that is, by substituting, instead of oxygen, at least one of four electron acceptors at the end of the electron transport chain: sulfate, nitrate, sulfur, or fumarate (all of which are less efficient than oxygen).

Most infections are due to ingestion of food contaminated by animal feces, or by human feces (for example, from the hands of a food-service worker at a commercial eatery). &quot;Salmonella&quot; serotypes can be divided into two main groups—typhoidal and nontyphoidal. Typhoidal serotypes include &quot;Salmonella&quot; Typhi and &quot;Salmonella&quot; Paratyphi A, which are adapted to humans and do not occur in other animals. Nontyphoidal serotypes are more common, and usually cause self-limiting gastrointestinal disease. They can infect a range of animals, and are zoonotic, meaning they can be transferred between humans and other animals.

&quot;Salmonella&quot; pathogenicity and host interaction has been studied extensively since the 2010s. Most of the important virulent genes of &quot;Salmonella&quot; are encoded in five pathogenicity islands — the so-called &quot;Salmonella&quot; pathogenicity islands (SPIs). These are chromosomal encoded and make a significant contribution to bacterial-host interaction. More traits, like plasmids, flagella or biofilm-related proteins, can contribute in the infection. SPIs are regulated by complex and fine-tuned regulatory networks that allow the gene expression only in the presence of the right environmental stresses.

Molecular modeling and active site analysis of SdiA homolog, a putative quorum sensor for Salmonella typhimurium pathogenicity, reveals the specific binding patterns of AHL transcriptional regulators. It is also known that Salmonella plasmid virulence gene spvB enhances bacterial virulence by inhibiting autophagy.

== Typhoidal &quot;Salmonella&quot; ==
Typhoid fever is caused by &quot;Salmonella&quot; serotypes which are strictly adapted to humans or higher primates—these include &quot;Salmonella&quot; Typhi, Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B, and Paratyphi C. In the systemic form of the disease, salmonellae pass through the lymphatic system of the intestine into the blood of the patients (typhoid form) and are carried to various organs (liver, spleen, kidneys) to form secondary foci (septic form). Endotoxins first act on the vascular and nervous apparatus, resulting in increased permeability and decreased tone of the vessels, upset of thermal regulation, and vomiting and diarrhoea. In severe forms of the disease, enough liquid and electrolytes are lost to upset the water-salt metabolism, decrease the circulating blood volume and arterial pressure, and cause hypovolemic shock. Septic shock may also develop. Shock of mixed character (with signs of both hypovolemic and septic shock) is more common in severe salmonellosis. Oliguria and azotemia may develop in severe cases as a result of renal involvement due to hypoxia and toxemia.

== Nontyphoidal &quot;Salmonella&quot; ==
=== Non-invasive ===
Infection with nontyphoidal serotypes of &quot;Salmonella&quot; generally results in food poisoning. Infection usually occurs when a person ingests foods that contain a high concentration of the bacteria. Infants and young children are much more susceptible to infection, easily achieved by ingesting a small number of bacteria. In infants, infection through inhalation of bacteria-laden dust is possible.

The organisms enter through the digestive tract and must be ingested in large numbers to cause disease in healthy adults. An infection can only begin after living salmonellae (not merely &quot;Salmonella&quot;-produced toxins) reach the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the microorganisms are killed in the stomach, while the surviving ones enter the small intestine and multiply in tissues. Gastric acidity is responsible for the destruction of the majority of ingested bacteria, but &quot;Salmonella&quot; has evolved a degree of tolerance to acidic environments that allows a subset of ingested bacteria to survive. Bacterial colonies may also become trapped in mucus produced in the esophagus. By the end of the incubation period, the nearby host cells are poisoned by endotoxins released from the dead salmonellae. The local response to the endotoxins is enteritis and gastrointestinal disorder.

About 2,000 serotypes of nontyphoidal &quot;Salmonella&quot; are known, which may be responsible for as many as 1.4 million illnesses in the United States each year. People who are at risk for severe illness include infants, elderly, organ-transplant recipients, and the immunocompromised.

=== Invasive ===
While, in developed countries, nontyphoidal serotypes present mostly as gastrointestinal disease, in sub-Saharan Africa, these serotypes can create a major problem in bloodstream infections, and are the most commonly isolated bacteria from the blood of those presenting with fever. Bloodstream infections caused by nontyphoidal salmonellae in Africa were reported in 2012 to have a case fatality rate of 20–25%. Most cases of invasive nontyphoidal &quot;Salmonella&quot; infection (iNTS) are caused by &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; Typhimurium or &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; Enteritidis. A new form of &quot;Salmonella&quot; Typhimurium (ST313) emerged in the southeast of the African continent 75 years ago, followed by a second wave which came out of central Africa 18 years later. This second wave of iNTS possibly originated in the Congo Basin, and early in the event picked up a gene that made it resistant to the antibiotic chloramphenicol. This created the need to use expensive antimicrobial drugs in areas of Africa that were very poor, making treatment difficult. The increased prevalence of iNTS in sub-Saharan Africa compared to other regions is thought to be due to the large proportion of the African population with some degree of immune suppression or impairment due to the burden of HIV, malaria, and malnutrition, especially in children. The genetic makeup of iNTS is evolving into a more typhoid-like bacterium, able to efficiently spread around the human body. Symptoms are reported to be diverse, including fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and respiratory symptoms, often with an absence of gastrointestinal symptoms.

=== Epidemiology ===
Due to being considered sporadic, between 60% and 80% of salmonella infections cases go undiagnosed. In March 2010, data analysis was completed to estimate an incidence rate of 1140 per 100,000 person-years. In the same analysis, 93.8 million cases of gastroenteritis were due to salmonella infections. At the 5th percentile the estimated amount was 61.8 million cases and at the 95th percentile the estimated amount was 131.6 million cases. The estimated number of deaths due to salmonella was approximately 155,000 deaths. In 2014, in countries such as Bulgaria and Portugal, children under 4 were 32 and 82 times more likely, respectively, to have a salmonella infection. Those who are most susceptible to infection are: children, pregnant women, elderly people, and those with deficient immune systems.

Risk factors for Salmonella infections include a variety of foods. Meats such as chicken and pork have the possibility to be contaminated. A variety of vegetables and sprouts may also have salmonella. Lastly, a variety of processed foods such as chicken nuggets and pot pies may also contain this bacteria.

Successful forms of prevention come from existing entities such as the FDA, United States Department of Agriculture, and the Food Safety and Inspection Service. All of these organizations create standards and inspections to ensure public safety in the U.S. For example, the FSIS agency working with the USDA has a Salmonella Action Plan in place. Recently, it received a two-year plan update in February 2016. Their accomplishments and strategies to reduce Salmonella infection are presented in the plans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also provides valuable information on preventative care, such has how to safely handle raw foods, and the correct way to store these products. In the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority created preventative measures through risk management and risk assessment. From 2005 to 2009, the EFSA placed an approach to reduce exposure to &quot;Salmonella&quot;. Their approach included risk assessment and risk management of poultry, which resulted in a reduction of infection cases by one half. In Latin America an orally administered vaccine for Salmonella in poultry developed by Dr. Sherry Layton has been introduced which prevents the bacteria from contaminating the birds.

A recent &quot;Salmonella&quot; Typhimurium outbreak has been linked to chocolate produced in Belgium, leading to the country halting Kinder chocolate production.

== Global monitoring ==
In Germany, food-borne infections must be reported. From 1990 to 2016, the number of officially recorded cases decreased from about 200,000 to about 13,000 cases. In the United States, about 1,200,000 cases of &quot;Salmonella&quot; infection are estimated to occur each year. A World Health Organization study estimated that 21,650,974 cases of typhoid fever occurred in 2000, 216,510 of which resulted in death, along with 5,412,744 cases of paratyphoid fever.

== Molecular mechanisms of infection ==
The mechanisms of infection differ between typhoidal and nontyphoidal serotypes, owing to their different targets in the body and the different symptoms that they cause. Both groups must enter by crossing the barrier created by the intestinal cell wall, but once they have passed this barrier, they use different strategies to cause infection.

=== Switch to virulence ===
While travelling to their target tissue in the gastrointestinal tract, &quot;Salmonella&quot; is exposed to stomach acid, to the detergent-like activity of bile in the intestine, to decreasing oxygen supply, to the competing normal gut flora, and finally to antimicrobial peptides present on the surface of the cells lining the intestinal wall. All of these form stresses that &quot;Salmonella&quot; can sense and reacts against, and they form virulence factors and as such regulate the switch from their normal growth in the intestine into virulence.

The switch to virulence gives access to a replication niche inside the host (such as humans), and can be summarised into several stages:

# Approach, in which they travel towards a host cell via intestinal peristalsis and through active swimming via the flagella, penetrate the mucus barrier, and locate themselves close to the epithelium lining the intestine,
# Adhesion, in which they adhere to a host cell using bacterial adhesins and a type III secretion system,
# Invasion, in which &quot;Salmonella&quot; enter the host cell (see variant mechanisms below),
# Replication, in which the bacterium may reproduce inside the host cell,
# Spread, in which the bacterium can spread to other organs via cells in the blood (if it succeeded in avoiding the immune defence). Alternatively, bacteria can go back towards the intestine, re-seeding the intestinal population.
# Re-invasion (a &quot;secondary infection&quot;, if now at a systemic site) and further replication.

=== Mechanisms of entry ===
Nontyphoidal serotypes preferentially enter M cells on the intestinal wall by bacterial-mediated endocytosis, a process associated with intestinal inflammation and diarrhoea. They are also able to disrupt tight junctions between the cells of the intestinal wall, impairing the cells&#x27; ability to stop the flow of ions, water, and immune cells into and out of the intestine. The combination of the inflammation caused by bacterial-mediated endocytosis and the disruption of tight junctions is thought to contribute significantly to the induction of diarrhoea.

Salmonellae are also able to breach the intestinal barrier via phagocytosis and trafficking by CD18-positive immune cells, which may be a mechanism key to typhoidal &quot;Salmonella&quot; infection. This is thought to be a more stealthy way of passing the intestinal barrier, and may, therefore, contribute to the fact that lower numbers of typhoidal &quot;Salmonella&quot; are required for infection than nontyphoidal &quot;Salmonella&quot;. &quot;Salmonella&quot; cells are able to enter macrophages via macropinocytosis. Typhoidal serotypes can use this to achieve dissemination throughout the body via the mononuclear phagocyte system, a network of connective tissue that contains immune cells, and surrounds tissue associated with the immune system throughout the body.

Much of the success of &quot;Salmonella&quot; in causing infection is attributed to two type III secretion systems (T3SS) which are expressed at different times during the infection. The T3SS-1 enables the injection of bacterial effectors within the host cytosol. These T3SS-1 effectors stimulate the formation of membrane ruffles allowing the uptake of &quot;Salmonella&quot; by nonphagocytic cells. &quot;Salmonella&quot; further resides within a membrane-bound compartment called the &quot;Salmonella&quot;-Containing Vacuole (SCV). The acidification of the SCV leads to the expression of the T3SS-2. The secretion of T3SS-2 effectors by &quot;Salmonella&quot; is required for its efficient survival in the host cytosol and establishment of systemic disease. In addition, both T3SS are involved in the colonization of the intestine, induction of intestinal inflammatory responses and diarrhea. These systems contain many genes which must work cooperatively to achieve infection.

The AvrA toxin injected by the SPI1 type III secretion system of &quot;S.&quot; Typhimurium works to inhibit the innate immune system by virtue of its serine/threonine acetyltransferase activity, and requires binding to eukaryotic target cell phytic acid (IP6). This leaves the host more susceptible to infection.

=== Clinical symptoms ===
Salmonellosis is known to be able to cause back pain or spondylosis. It can manifest as five clinical patterns: gastrointestinal tract infection, enteric fever, bacteremia, local infection, and the chronic reservoir state. The initial symptoms are nonspecific fever, weakness, and myalgia among others. In the bacteremia state, it can spread to any parts of the body and this induces localized infection or it forms abscesses. The forms of localized &quot;Salmonella&quot; infections are arthritis, urinary tract infection, infection of the central nervous system, bone infection, soft tissue infection, etc. Infection may remain as the latent form for a long time, and when the function of reticular endothelial cells is deteriorated, it may become activated and consequently, it may secondarily induce spreading infection in the bone several months or several years after acute salmonellosis.

A 2018 Imperial College London study also shows how salmonella disrupt specific arms of the immune system (e.g. 3 of 5 NF-kappaB proteins) using a family of zinc metalloproteinase effectors, leaving others untouched. Salmonella thyroid abscess has also been reported.

== Resistance to oxidative burst ==
A hallmark of &quot;Salmonella&quot; pathogenesis is the ability of the bacterium to survive and proliferate within phagocytes. Phagocytes produce DNA-damaging agents such as nitric oxide and oxygen radicals as a defense against pathogens. Thus, &quot;Salmonella&quot; species must face attack by molecules that challenge genome integrity. Buchmeier&quot; et al.&quot; showed that mutants of &quot;S. enterica&quot; lacking RecA or RecBC protein function are highly sensitive to oxidative compounds synthesized by macrophages, and furthermore these findings indicate that successful systemic infection by &quot;S. enterica&quot; requires RecA- and RecBC-mediated recombinational repair of DNA damage.

== Host adaptation ==
&quot;S. enterica&quot;, through some of its serotypes such as Typhimurium and Enteritidis, shows signs that it has the ability to infect several different mammalian host species, while other serotypes, such as Typhi, seem to be restricted to only a few hosts. Two ways that &quot;Salmonella&quot; serotypes have adapted to their hosts are by the loss of genetic material, and mutation. In more complex mammalian species, immune systems, which include pathogen specific immune responses, target serovars of &quot;Salmonella&quot; by binding antibodies to structures such as flagella. Thus &quot;Salmonella&quot; that has lost the genetic material which codes for a flagellum to form can evade a host&#x27;s immune system. &quot;mgtC&quot; leader RNA from bacteria virulence gene (mgtCBR operon) decreases flagellin production during infection by directly base pairing with mRNAs of the &quot;fljB&quot; gene encoding flagellin and promotes degradation. In the study by Kisela &quot;et al.&quot;, more pathogenic serovars of &quot;S. enterica&quot; were found to have certain adhesins in common that have developed out of convergent evolution. This means that, as these strains of &quot;Salmonella&quot; have been exposed to similar conditions such as immune systems, similar structures evolved separately to negate these similar, more advanced defenses in hosts. Although many questions remain about how &quot;Salmonella&quot; has evolved into so many different types, &quot;Salmonella&quot; may have evolved through several phases. For example, as Baumler &quot;et al.&quot; have suggested, &quot;Salmonella&quot; most likely evolved through horizontal gene transfer, and through the formation of new serovars due to additional pathogenicity islands, and through an approximation of its ancestry. So, &quot;Salmonella&quot; could have evolved into its many different serotypes by gaining genetic information from different pathogenic bacteria. The presence of several pathogenicity islands in the genome of different serotypes has lent credence to this theory.

&quot;Salmonella&quot; sv. Newport shows signs of adaptation to a plant-colonization lifestyle, which may play a role in its disproportionate association with food-borne illness linked to produce. A variety of functions selected for during sv. Newport persistence in tomatoes have been reported to be similar to those selected for in sv. Typhimurium from animal hosts. The &quot;papA&quot; gene, which is unique to sv. Newport, contributes to the strain&#x27;s fitness in tomatoes, and has homologs in the genomes of other Enterobacteriaceae that are able to colonize plant and animal hosts.

== Research ==
In addition to their importance as pathogens, nontyphoidal Salmonella species such as &quot;S. enterica&quot; serovar Typhimurium are commonly used as homologues of typhoid species. Many findings are transferable and it attenuates the danger for the researcher in case of contamination, but is also limited. For example, it is not possible to study specific typhoidal toxins using this model. However, strong research tools such as the commonly-used mouse intestine gastroenteritis model build upon the use of &quot;Salmonella&quot; Typhimurium.

For genetics, &quot;S.&quot; Typhimurium has been instrumental in the development of genetic tools that led to an understanding of fundamental bacterial physiology. These developments were enabled by the discovery of the first generalized transducing phage P22 in &quot;S&quot;. Typhimurium, that allowed quick and easy genetic editing. In turn, this made fine structure genetic analysis possible. The large number of mutants led to a revision of genetic nomenclature for bacteria. Many of the uses of transposons as genetic tools, including transposon delivery, mutagenesis, and construction of chromosome rearrangements, were also developed in &quot;S&quot;. Typhimurium. These genetic tools also led to a simple test for carcinogens, the Ames test.

As a natural alternative to traditional antimicrobials, phages are being recognised as highly effective control agents for Salmonella and other foodborne bacteria.

== Ancient DNA ==
&quot;S. enterica&quot; genomes have been reconstructed from up to 6,500 year old human remains across Western Eurasia, which provides evidence for geographic widespread infections with systemic &quot;S. enterica&quot; during prehistory, and a possible role of the Neolithization process in the evolution of host adaptation. Additional reconstructed genomes from colonial Mexico suggest &quot;S. enterica&quot; as the cause of &quot;cocoliztli&quot;, an epidemic in 16th-century New Spain.

<text>Paul Julius Reuter (born Jordan Beer Josaphat; 21 July 1816 – 25 February 1899), later ennobled as Freiherr von Reuter (Baron von Reuter), was a German-born British entrepreneur who was a pioneer of telegraphy and news reporting. He was a reporter, media owner, and the founder of the Reuters news agency, which became part of the Thomson Reuters conglomerate in 2008.

==Life and career==
Reuter was born in a Jewish family as Jordan Beer Josaphat in Kassel, Electorate of Hesse (now part of the Federal Republic of Germany). His father, Samuel Levi Josaphat, was a rabbi. His mother was Betty Sanders. In Göttingen, Reuter met Carl Friedrich Gauss, who was experimenting with the transmission of electrical signals via wire.

On 16 November 1845, he converted to Christianity in a ceremony at St. George&#x27;s German Lutheran Chapel in London, and changed his name to Paul Julius Reuter. One week later, in the same chapel, he married Ida Maria Elizabeth Clementine Magnus of Berlin, daughter of a German banker.

A former bank clerk, in 1847 he founded Reuter and Stargardt, a Berlin book-publishing firm, with Joseph Abraham Stargardt. The distribution of radical pamphlets by the firm at the beginning of the 1848 Revolution may have focused official scrutiny on Reuter. Later that year, he left for Paris and worked in Charles-Louis Havas&#x27; news agency, Agence Havas, the future Agence France Presse.

As electrical telegraphy evolved, Reuter founded his own news agency in Aachen. Until the entire distance was connected by telegraph, messages were transferred on the leg between Brussels and Aachen using homing pigeons, completing the link to Berlin and Paris. Speedier than the post train, pigeons gave Reuter faster access to financial news from the Paris stock exchange. Eventually the telegraph link was completed and the pigeons were no longer necessary.

A telegraph line was being laid between Britain and continental Europe, so Reuter moved to London, renting an office near the Stock Exchange. In 1863, he privately erected a telegraph link to Crookhaven, the farthest south-western point of Ireland. On nearing Crookhaven, ships from the U.S. threw canisters containing news into the sea. These were retrieved by Reuters and telegraphed directly to London, arriving long before the ships reached Cork.

On 17 March 1857, Reuter was naturalised as a British subject. On 7 September 1871, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha granted him the noble title of (baron). In November 1891, Queen Victoria granted him and his male-line successors the right to use that German title (listed as Baron von Reuter) in Britain.

In 1872, Nasir al-Din Shah, the Shah of Iran, signed a surprisingly lopsided concession agreement with Reuter. George Curzon wrote that:

[t]he concession was dated 25 July 1872. When published to the world, it was found to contain the most complete and extraordinary surrender of the entire industrial resources of a kingdom into foreign hands that has probably ever been dreamed of, much less accomplished, in history. Exclusive of the clauses referring to railroads and tramways, which conferred an absolute monopoly of both those undertakings upon Baron de Reuter for the space of seventy years, the concession also handed over to him the exclusive working for the same period of all Persian mines, except those of gold, silver, and precious stones; the monopoly of the government forests, all uncultivated land being embraced under that designation; the exclusive construction of canals, kanats, and irrigation works of every description; the first refusal of a national bank, and of all future enterprises connected with the introduction of roads, telegraphs, mills, factories, workshops, and public works of every description; and a farm of the entire customs of the empire for a period of twenty-five years from 1 March 1874, upon payment to the Shah of a stipulated sum for the first five years, and of an additional sixty per cent of the net revenue for the remaining twenty. With respect to the other profits, twenty per cent of those accruing from railways, and fifteen per cent of those derived from all other sources, were reserved for the Persian Government.
The Reuter concession was immediately denounced by all ranks of businessmen, clergy, and nationalists of Persia, and it was quickly forced into cancellation.

==Marriage and children==
In 1845, Reuter married Ida Maria Magnus, daughter of Friedrich Martin Magnus, a German banker in Berlin. They had three sons: Herbert, who became the 2nd baron (succeeded by his son Hubert as 3rd baron), George and Alfred. Clementine Maria, one of his daughters, married Count , and after Stenbock&#x27;s death, Sir Herbert Chermside, a governor of Queensland.

The 2nd baron&#x27;s brother George had two sons, Oliver (who became the 4th baron) and Ronald. The last member of the family, Marguerite, Baroness de Reuter, widow of the 4th baron and Paul Julius Reuter&#x27;s granddaughter-in-law, died on 25 January 2009, at the age of 96.

==Death and legacy==
Reuter died in 1899 in Nice, France.

Reuter was portrayed by Edward G. Robinson in the Warner Bros. biographical film &quot;A Dispatch from Reuters&quot; (1941).

The Reuters News Agency commemorated the 100th anniversary of its founder&#x27;s death by launching a university award (the Paul Julius Reuter Innovation Award) in Germany.

<text>A server is a computer that provides information to other computers called &quot;clients&quot; on a computer network. This architecture is called the client–server model. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called &quot;services&quot;, such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients or performing computations for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device. Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers.

Client–server systems are usually most frequently implemented by (and often identified with) the request–response model: a client sends a request to the server, which performs some action and sends a response back to the client, typically with a result or acknowledgment. Designating a computer as &quot;server-class hardware&quot; implies that it is specialized for running servers on it. This often implies that it is more powerful and reliable than standard personal computers, but alternatively, large computing clusters may be composed of many relatively simple, replaceable server components.

== History ==
The use of the word &quot;server&quot; in computing comes from queueing theory, where it dates to the mid 20th century, being notably used in (along with &quot;service&quot;), the paper that introduced Kendall&#x27;s notation. In earlier papers, such as the , more concrete terms such as &quot;[telephone] operators&quot; are used.

In computing, &quot;server&quot; dates at least to RFC 5 (1969), one of the earliest documents describing ARPANET (the predecessor of Internet), and is contrasted with &quot;user&quot;, distinguishing two types of host: &quot;server-host&quot; and &quot;user-host&quot;. The use of &quot;serving&quot; also dates to early documents, such as RFC 4, contrasting &quot;serving-host&quot; with &quot;using-host&quot;.

The Jargon File defines &quot;server&quot; in the common sense of a process performing service for requests, usually remote, with the 1981 version reading:
 The average utilization of a server in the early 2000s was 5 to 15%, but with the adoption of virtualization this figure started to increase to reduce the number of servers needed.

== Operation ==

Strictly speaking, the term &quot;server&quot; refers to a computer program or process (running program). Through metonymy, it refers to a device used for (or a device dedicated to) running one or several server programs. On a network, such a device is called a &quot;host&quot;. In addition to &quot;server&quot;, the words &quot;serve&quot; and &quot;service&quot; (as verb and as noun respectively) are frequently used, though &quot;servicer&quot; and &quot;servant&quot; are not. The word &quot;service&quot; (noun) may refer to the abstract form of functionality, e.g. Web service. Alternatively, it may refer to a computer program that turns a computer into a server, e.g. Windows service. Originally used as &quot;servers serve users&quot; (and &quot;users use servers&quot;), in the sense of &quot;obey&quot;, today one often says that &quot;servers serve data&quot;, in the same sense as &quot;give&quot;. For instance, web servers &quot;serve [up] web pages to users&quot; or &quot;service their requests&quot;.

The server is part of the client–server model; in this model, a server serves data for clients. The nature of communication between a client and server is request and response. This is in contrast with peer-to-peer model in which the relationship is on-demand reciprocation. In principle, any computerized process that can be used or called by another process (particularly remotely, particularly to share a resource) is a server, and the calling process or processes is a client. Thus any general-purpose computer connected to a network can host servers. For example, if files on a device are shared by some process, that process is a file server. Similarly, web server software can &quot;run&quot; on any capable computer, and so a laptop or a personal computer can host a web server.

While request–response is the most common client-server design, there are others, such as the publish–subscribe pattern. In the publish-subscribe pattern, clients register with a pub-sub server, subscribing to specified types of messages; this initial registration may be done by request-response. Thereafter, the pub-sub server forwards matching messages to the clients &quot;without&quot; any further requests: the server &quot;pushes&quot; messages to the client, rather than the client &quot;pulling&quot; messages from the server as in request-response.

== Purpose ==

The role of a server is to share data as well as to share resources and distribute work. A server computer can serve its own computer programs as well; depending on the scenario, this could be part of a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; transaction, or simply a technical possibility. The following table shows several scenarios in which a server is used.

Almost the entire structure of the Internet is based upon a client–server model. High-level root nameservers, DNS, and routers direct the traffic on the internet. There are millions of servers connected to the Internet, running continuously throughout the world and virtually every action taken by an ordinary Internet user requires one or more interactions with one or more servers. There are exceptions that do not use dedicated servers; for example, peer-to-peer file sharing and some implementations of telephony (e.g. pre-Microsoft Skype).

== Hardware ==
Hardware requirement for servers vary widely, depending on the server&#x27;s purpose and its software. Servers often are more powerful and expensive than the clients that connect to them.

The name server is used both for the hardware and software pieces. For the hardware servers, it is usually limited to mean the high-end machines although software servers can run on a variety of hardwares.

Since servers are usually accessed over a network, many run unattended without a computer monitor or input device, audio hardware and USB interfaces. Many servers do not have a graphical user interface (GUI). They are configured and managed remotely. Remote management can be conducted via various methods including Microsoft Management Console (MMC), PowerShell, SSH and browser-based out-of-band management systems such as Dell&#x27;s iDRAC or HP&#x27;s iLo.

=== Large servers ===
Large traditional single servers would need to be run for long periods without interruption. Availability would have to be very high, making hardware reliability and durability extremely important. Mission-critical enterprise servers would be very fault tolerant and use specialized hardware with low failure rates in order to maximize uptime. Uninterruptible power supplies might be incorporated to guard against power failure. Servers typically include hardware redundancy such as dual power supplies, RAID disk systems, and ECC memory, along with extensive pre-boot memory testing and verification. Critical components might be hot swappable, allowing technicians to replace them on the running server without shutting it down, and to guard against overheating, servers might have more powerful fans or use water cooling. They will often be able to be configured, powered up and down, or rebooted remotely, using out-of-band management, typically based on IPMI. Server casings are usually flat and wide, and designed to be rack-mounted, either on 19-inch racks or on Open Racks.

These types of servers are often housed in dedicated data centers. These will normally have very stable power and Internet and increased security. Noise is also less of a concern, but power consumption and heat output can be a serious issue. Server rooms are equipped with air conditioning devices.

=== Clusters ===

A &quot;server farm&quot; or &quot;server cluster&quot; is a collection of computer servers maintained by an organization to supply server functionality far beyond the capability of a single device. Modern data centers are now often built of very large clusters of much simpler servers, and there is a collaborative effort, Open Compute Project around this concept.

=== Appliances ===
A class of small specialist servers called network appliances are generally at the low end of the scale, often being smaller than common desktop computers.

=== Mobile ===
A mobile server has a portable form factor, e.g. a laptop. In contrast to large data centers or rack servers, the mobile server is designed for on-the-road or &quot;ad hoc&quot; deployment into emergency, disaster or temporary environments where traditional servers are not feasible due to their power requirements, size, and deployment time. The main beneficiaries of so-called &quot;server on the go&quot; technology include network managers, software or database developers, training centers, military personnel, law enforcement, forensics, emergency relief groups, and service organizations. To facilitate portability, features such as the keyboard, display, battery (uninterruptible power supply, to provide power redundancy in case of failure), and mouse are all integrated into the chassis.

== Operating systems ==

On the Internet, the dominant operating systems among servers are UNIX-like open-source distributions, such as those based on Linux and FreeBSD, with Windows Server also having a significant share. Proprietary operating systems such as z/OS and macOS Server are also deployed, but in much smaller numbers. Servers that run Linux are commonly used as Webservers or Databanks. Windows Servers are used for Networks that are made out of Windows Clients.

Specialist server-oriented operating systems have traditionally had features such as:
* GUI not available or optional
* Ability to reconfigure and update both hardware and software to some extent without restart
* Advanced backup facilities to permit regular and frequent online backups of critical data,
* Transparent data transfer between different volumes or devices
* Flexible and advanced networking capabilities
* Automation capabilities such as daemons in UNIX and services in Windows
* Tight system security, with advanced user, resource, data, and memory protection.
* Advanced detection and alerting on conditions such as overheating, processor and disk failure.

In practice, today many desktop and server operating systems share similar code bases, differing mostly in configuration.

== Energy consumption ==
In 2010, data centers (servers, cooling, and other electrical infrastructure) were responsible for 1.1–1.5% of electrical energy consumption worldwide and 1.7–2.2% in the United States. One estimate is that total energy consumption for information and communications technology saves more than 5 times its carbon footprint in the rest of the economy by increasing efficiency.

Global energy consumption is increasing due to the increasing demand of data and bandwidth. Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) states that data centers used 91 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) electrical energy in 2013 which accounts to 3% of global electricity usage.

Environmental groups have placed focus on the carbon emissions of data centers as it accounts to 200 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in a year.

<text>Haile Selassie I, (born Tafari Makonnen or Lij Tafari; 23 July 189227 August 1975) was Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974. He rose to power as the Regent Plenipotentiary of Ethiopia (&quot;&quot;) under Empress Zewditu between 1916 and 1930. Widely considered to be a defining figure in modern Ethiopian history, he is accorded divine importance in Rastafari, an Abrahamic religion that emerged in the 1930s. A few years before he began his reign over the Ethiopian Empire, Selassie defeated Ethiopian army commander Ras Gugsa Welle Bitul, nephew of Empress Taytu Betul, at the Battle of Anchem. He belonged to the Solomonic dynasty, founded by Emperor Yekuno Amlak in 1270; Amlak&#x27;s successors claimed that he was a lineal descendant of Menelik I, the legendary Emperor of Ethiopia who was supposedly born to King Solomon and Queen Makeda of the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Sheba, respectively. Historians regard the Solomonic lineage claim as unfounded, created by Amlak to justify wresting power from the Zagwe Dynasty.

Selassie, seeking to modernise Ethiopia, introduced political and social reforms including the 1931 constitution and the abolition of slavery in 1942. He led the empire during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, and after its defeat was exiled to the United Kingdom. When the Italian occupation of East Africa began, he traveled to Anglo-Egyptian Sudan to coordinate the Ethiopian struggle against Fascist Italy; he returned home after the East African campaign of World War II. He dissolved the Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea, established by the United Nations General Assembly in 1950, and annexed Eritrea as one of Ethiopia&#x27;s provinces, while also fighting to prevent Eritrean secession.
As an internationalist, Selassie led Ethiopia&#x27;s accession to the United Nations. In 1963, he presided over the formation of the Organisation of African Unity, the precursor of the African Union, and served as its first chairman. By the early 1960s, prominent African socialists such as Kwame Nkrumah envisioned the creation of a &quot;United States of Africa&quot;. Their rhetoric was anti-Western; Selassie saw this as a threat to his alliances. He attempted to influence a more moderate posture within the group.

Amidst popular uprisings, Selassie was overthrown by the Derg in the 1974 Ethiopian coup d&#x27;état. With support from the Soviet Union, the Derg began governing Ethiopia as a Marxist–Leninist state. In 1994, three years after the fall of the Derg military junta, it was revealed to the public that the Derg had assassinated Selassie at the Jubilee Palace in Addis Ababa on 27 August 1975. On 5 November 2000, his excavated remains were buried at the Holy Trinity Cathedral of Addis Ababa.

Among adherents of Rastafari, Selassie is called the returned Jesus, although he was an adherent of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church himself. He has been criticised for his suppression of rebellions among the landed aristocracy (&quot;&quot;), which consistently opposed his changes. Others have criticised Ethiopia&#x27;s failure to modernise rapidly enough. During his reign, the Harari people were persecuted and many left their homes. His administration was criticised as autocratic and illiberal by groups such as Human Rights Watch. According to some sources, late into Selassie&#x27;s administration, the Oromo language was banned from education, public speaking and use in administration, though there was never a law that criminalised any language. His government relocated many Amhara people into southern Ethiopia. Following the death of Ethiopian civil rights activist Hachalu Hundessa in 2020, his bust in the United Kingdom was destroyed by Oromo protesters, and an equestrian monument depicting his father was removed from Harar.

==Name==
Haile Selassie was known as a child as Lij Tafari Makonnen (). &quot;Lij&quot; is translated as &quot;child&quot; and serves to indicate that a youth is of noble blood. His given name &quot;Tafari&quot; means &quot;one who is respected or feared&quot;. Like most Ethiopians, his personal name &quot;Tafari&quot; is followed by that of his father Makonnen and that of his grandfather Woldemikael. His name &quot;Haile Selassie&quot; was given to him at his infant baptism and adopted again as part of his regnal name in 1930.

On 1 November 1905, at the age of 13, Tafari was appointed by his father as the Dejazmatch of Gara Mulatta (a region some twenty miles southwest of Harar). The literal translation of Dejazmatch is &quot;keeper of the door&quot;; it is a title of nobility equivalent to a count. On 27 September 1916, he was proclaimed Crown Prince and heir apparent to the throne (&quot;Alga Worrach&quot;), and appointed Regent Plenipotentiary (&quot;Balemulu Silt&#x27;an Enderase&quot;). On 11 February 1917, he was crowned Le&#x27;ul-Ras and became known as Ras Tafari Makonnen . &quot;Ras&quot; is translated as &quot;head&quot; and is a rank of nobility equivalent to a duke, though it is often rendered in translation as &quot;prince&quot;. Originally the title &quot;Le&#x27;ul&quot;, which means &quot;Your Highness&quot;, was only ever used as a form of address; however, in 1916 the title &quot;Le&#x27;ul-Ras&quot; replaced the senior office of &quot;Ras Bitwoded&quot; and so became the equivalent of a royal duke. In 1928, Empress Zewditu planned on granting him the throne of Shewa; however, at the last moment opposition from certain provincial rulers caused a change and his title &quot;Negus&quot; or &quot;King&quot; was conferred without geographical qualification or definition.

On 2 November 1930, after the death of Empress Zewditu, Tafari was crowned &quot;Negusa Nagast&quot;, literally &quot;King of Kings&quot;, rendered in English as &quot;Emperor&quot;. Upon his ascension, he took as his regnal name Haile Selassie I. &quot;Haile&quot; means in Ge&#x27;ez &quot;Power of&quot; and &quot;Selassie&quot; means trinitytherefore &quot;Haile Selassie&quot; roughly translates to &quot;Power of the Trinity&quot;. Selassie&#x27;s full title in office was &quot;By the Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah, His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I, King of Kings of Ethiopia, Lord of Lords, Elect of God&quot;. This title reflects Ethiopian dynastic traditions, which hold that all monarchs must trace their lineage to Menelik I, who is described by the Kebra Nagast (a 14th-century CE national epic) as the son of the tenth-century BCE King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.

To Ethiopians, Selassie has been known by many names, including Janhoy (&quot;His Majesty&quot;) Talaqu Meri (&quot;Great Leader&quot;) and Abba Tekel (&quot;Father of Tekel&quot;, his horse name). The Rastafari movement employs many of these appellations, also referring to him as Jah, Jah Jah, Jah Rastafari, and HIM (the abbreviation of &quot;His Imperial Majesty&quot;).

==Early life==

Tafari&#x27;s royal line (through his paternal grandmother) descended from the Shewan Amhara Solomonic king, Sahle Selassie. He was born on 23 July 1892, in the village of Ejersa Goro, in the Hararghe province of Ethiopia. Tafari&#x27;s mother, Woizero (&quot;Lady&quot;) Yeshimebet Ali Abba Jifar, was paternally of Oromo descent and maternally of Silte heritage, while his father, Ras Makonnen Wolde Mikael, was maternally of Amhara descent but his paternal lineage remains disputed. Tafari&#x27;s paternal grandfather belonged to a noble family from Shewa and was the governor of the districts of Menz and Doba, which are located in Semien Shewa. Tafari&#x27;s mother was the daughter of a ruling chief from Were Ilu in Wollo province, Dejazmach Ali Abba Jifar. Ras Makonnen was the grandson of King Sahle Selassie who was once the ruler of Shewa. He served as a general in the First Italo–Ethiopian War, playing a key role at the Battle of Adwa; Selassie was thus able to ascend to the imperial throne through his paternal grandmother, Woizero Tenagnework Sahle Selassie, who was an aunt of Emperor Menelik II and daughter of the Solomonic Amhara King of Shewa, Negus Sahle Selassie. As such, Selassie claimed direct descent from Makeda, the Queen of Sheba, and King Solomon of ancient Israel.

Ras Makonnen arranged for Tafari as well as his first cousin, Imru Haile Selassie, to receive instruction in Harar from Abba Samuel Wolde Kahin, an Ethiopian Capuchin friar, and from Dr. Vitalien, a surgeon from Guadeloupe. Tafari was named Dejazmach (literally &quot;commander of the gate&quot;, roughly equivalent to &quot;count&quot;) at the age of 13, on 1 November 1905. Shortly thereafter, his father Makonnen died at Kulibi, in 1906.

===Governorship===


Tafari assumed the titular governorship of Selale in 1906, a realm of marginal importance, but one that enabled him to continue his studies. In 1907, he was appointed governor over part of the province of Sidamo. It is alleged that during his late teens, Selassie was married to &quot;Woizero&quot; Altayech, and that from this union, his daughter Princess Romanework was born.

Following the death of his brother Yelma in 1907, the governorate of Harar was left vacant, and its administration was left to Menelik&#x27;s loyal general, &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Balcha Safo. Balcha Safo&#x27;s administration of Harar was ineffective, and so during the last illness of Menelik II, and the brief reign of Empress Taytu Betul, Tafari was made governor of Harar in 1910 or 1911.

=== Marriage ===
On 3 August 1911, Tafari married Menen Asfaw of Ambassel, niece of the heir to the throne Lij Iyasu. Menen Asfaw was 22 years old while Tafari was 19 years of age. Menen had already married two previous noblemen, while Tafari had one previous wife and one child. The marriage between Menen Asfaw and Selassie lasted for 50 years. Although possibly a political match designed to create peace between Ethiopian nobles, the couple&#x27;s family had said they married with mutual consent. Selassie described his spouse as a &quot;woman without any malice whatsoever&quot;.

== Regency ==
The extent to which Tafari Makonnen contributed to the movement that would come to depose Lij Iyasu has been discussed extensively, particularly in Selassie&#x27;s own detailed account of the matter. Iyasu was the designated but uncrowned emperor of Ethiopia from 1913 to 1916. Iyasu&#x27;s reputation for scandalous behavior and a disrespectful attitude towards the nobles at the court of his grandfather, Menelik II, damaged his reputation. Iyasu&#x27;s flirtation with Islam was considered treasonous among the Ethiopian Orthodox Christian leadership of the empire. On 27 September 1916, Iyasu was deposed.

Contributing to the movement that deposed Iyasu were conservatives such as &quot;Fitawrari&quot; Habte Giyorgis, Menelik II&#x27;s longtime Minister of War. The movement to depose Iyasu preferred Tafari, as he attracted support from both progressive and conservative factions. Ultimately, Iyasu was deposed on the grounds of conversion to Islam. In his place, the daughter of Menelik II (the aunt of Iyasu) was named Empress Zewditu, while Tafari was elevated to the rank of &quot;Ras&quot; and was made heir apparent and Crown Prince. In the power arrangement that followed, Tafari accepted the role of Regent Plenipotentiary (&quot;Balemulu &#x27;Inderase&quot;) and became the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the Ethiopian Empire (&quot;Mangista Ityop&#x27;p&#x27;ya&quot;). Zewditu would govern while Tafari would administer.

While Iyasu had been deposed on 27 September 1916, on 8 October he managed to escape into the Ogaden Desert and his father, &quot;Negus&quot; Mikael of Wollo, had time to come to his aid. On 27 October, &quot;Negus&quot; Mikael and his army met an army under &quot;Fitawrari&quot; Habte Giyorgis loyal to Zewditu and Tafari. During the Battle of Segale, Mikael was defeated and captured. Any chance that Iyasu would regain the throne was ended, and he went into hiding. On 11 January 1921, after avoiding capture for about five years, Iyasu was taken into custody by Gugsa Araya Selassie.
On 11 February 1917, the coronation for Zewditu took place. She pledged to rule justly through her regent, Tafari. While Tafari was the more visible of the two, Zewditu was not simply an honorary ruler, but she did have some political restraints due to the complicated nature of her position compared to other Ethiopian monarchs, one was that it required that she arbitrate the claims of competing factions. In other words, she had the last word. But unlike other monarchs Tafari carried the burden of daily administration, but, initially because his position was relatively weak, this was often an exercise in futility. His personal army was poorly equipped, his finances were limited, and he had little leverage to withstand the combined influence of the Empress, the Minister of War, or the provincial governors. Nonetheless, her authority weakened while Tafari&#x27;s power increased, she focused on praying and fasting and much less in her official duties which allowed Tafari to later have greater influence than even the Empress.

During his Regency, the new Crown Prince developed the policy of cautious modernisation initiated by Menelik II. Also, during this time, he survived the 1918 flu pandemic, having come down with the illness as someone fairly &quot;prone to&quot; the effects of disease throughout his life. He secured Ethiopia&#x27;s admission to the League of Nations in 1923 by promising to eradicate slavery; each emperor since Tewodros II had issued proclamations to halt slavery, but without effect: the internationally scorned practice persisted well into Selassie&#x27;s reign with an estimated 2 million slaves in Ethiopia in the early 1930s.

=== Travel abroad ===

In 1924, Ras Tafari toured Europe and the Middle East visiting Jerusalem, Alexandria, Paris, Luxembourg, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm, London, Geneva, Gibraltar and Athens. With him on his tour was a group that included Ras Seyum Mangasha of western Tigray Province; Ras Hailu Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam province; Ras Mulugeta Yeggazu of Illubabor Province; Ras Makonnen Endelkachew; and &quot;Blattengeta&quot; Heruy Welde Selassie. The primary goal of the trip to Europe was for Ethiopia to gain access to the sea. In Paris, Tafari was to find out from the French Foreign Ministry (&quot;Quai d&#x27;Orsay&quot;) that this goal would not be realised. However, failing this, he and his retinue inspected schools, hospitals, factories, and churches. Although patterning many reforms after European models, Tafari remained wary of European pressure. To guard against economic imperialism, Tafari required that all enterprises have at least partial local ownership. Of his modernisation campaign, he remarked, &quot;We need European progress only because we are surrounded by it. That is at once a benefit and a misfortune.&quot;

Throughout Tafari&#x27;s travels in Europe, the Levant, and Egypt, he and his entourage were greeted with enthusiasm and fascination. Seyum Mangasha accompanied him and Hailu Tekle Haymanot who, like Tafari, were sons of generals who contributed to the victorious war against Italy a quarter-century earlier at the Battle of Adwa. Another member of his entourage, Mulugeta Yeggazu, actually fought at Adwa as a young man. The &quot;Oriental Dignity&quot; of the Ethiopians and their &quot;rich, picturesque court dress&quot; were sensationalised in the media; among his entourage he even included a pride of lions, which he distributed as gifts to President Alexandre Millerand and Prime Minister Raymond Poincaré of France, to King George V of the United Kingdom, and to the Zoological Garden (&quot;Jardin Zoologique&quot;) of Paris, France. As one historian noted, &quot;Rarely can a tour have inspired so many anecdotes&quot;. In return for two lions, the United Kingdom presented Tafari with the imperial crown of Emperor Tewodros II for its safe return to Empress Zewditu. The crown had been taken by General Sir Robert Napier during the 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia.

In this period, the Crown Prince visited the Armenian monastery of Jerusalem. There, he adopted 40 Armenian orphans (አርባ ልጆች &quot;Arba Lijoch&quot;, &quot;forty children&quot;), who had lost their parents during the Armenian Genocide. Tafari arranged for the musical education of the youths, and they came to form the imperial brass band.

== Reign ==

=== King and Emperor ===
Tafari&#x27;s authority was challenged in 1928 when &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Balcha Safo went to Addis Ababa with a sizeable armed force. When Tafari consolidated his hold over the provinces, many of Menelik&#x27;s appointees refused to abide by the new regulations. Balcha Safo, the governor (&quot;Shum&quot;) of coffee-rich Sidamo Province, was particularly troublesome. The revenues he remitted to the central government did not reflect the accrued profits and Tafari recalled him to Addis Ababa. The old man came in high dudgeon and, insultingly, with a large army. The &quot;Dejazmatch&quot; paid homage to Empress Zewditu, but snubbed Tafari. On 18 February, while Balcha Safo and his personal bodyguard were in Addis Ababa, Tafari had &quot;Ras&quot; Kassa Haile Darge buy off Balcha Safo&#x27;s army, and arranged to have him replaced as &quot;Shum&quot; of Sidamo Province by Birru Wolde Gabriel – who himself was replaced by Desta Damtew.

Even so, the gesture of Balcha Safo empowered Empress Zewditu politically and she attempted to have Tafari tried for treason. He was tried for his benevolent dealings with Italy including a 20-year peace accord that was signed on 2 August. In September, a group of palace reactionaries including some courtiers of the Empress made a final bid to get rid of Tafari. The attempted &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; was tragic in its origins and comic in its end. When confronted by Tafari and a company of his troops, the ringleaders of the coup took refuge on the palace grounds in Menelik&#x27;s mausoleum. Tafari and his men surrounded them, only to be surrounded themselves by the personal guard of Zewditu. More of Tafari&#x27;s khaki clad soldiers arrived and decided the outcome in his favor with superiority of arms. Popular support, as well as the support of the police, remained with Tafari. Ultimately, the Empress relented, and, on 7 October 1928, she crowned Tafari as &quot;Negus&quot; (Amharic: &quot;King&quot;).

The crowning of Tafari as King was controversial. He occupied the same territory as the Empress rather than going off to a regional kingdom of the empire. Two monarchs, even with one being the vassal and the other the emperor (in this case empress), had never ruled from a single location simultaneously in Ethiopian history. Conservatives agitated to redress this perceived insult to the crown&#x27;s dignity, leading to the &quot;Ras&quot; Gugsa Welle&#x27;s rebellion. Gugsa Welle was the husband of the Empress and the &quot;Shum&quot; of Begemder Province. In early 1930, he raised an army and marched it from his governorate at Gondar towards Addis Ababa. On 31 March 1930, Gugsa Welle was met by forces loyal to &quot;Negus&quot; Tafari and was defeated at the Battle of Anchem. Gugsa Welle was killed in action. News of Gugsa Welle&#x27;s defeat and death had hardly spread through Addis Ababa when the Empress died suddenly on 2 April 1930. Although it was long rumored that the Empress was poisoned upon her husband&#x27;s defeat, or alternately that she died from shock upon hearing of the death of her estranged yet beloved husband, it has since been documented that Zewditu succumbed to paratyphoid fever and complications from diabetes after the Orthodox clergy imposed strict rules concerning her diet during Lent, against her physicians&#x27; orders.

Upon Zewditu&#x27;s death, Tafari himself rose to emperor and was proclaimed &quot;Neguse Negest ze-&#x27;Ityopp&#x27;ya&quot;, &quot;King of Kings of Ethiopia&quot;. He was crowned on 2 November 1930, at Addis Ababa&#x27;s Cathedral of St. George. The coronation was by all accounts &quot;a most splendid affair&quot;, and it was attended by royals and dignitaries from all over the world. Among those in attendance were the Duke of Gloucester (King George V&#x27;s son), Marshal Louis Franchet d&#x27;Espèrey of France, and the Prince of Udine representing King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. Special Ambassador Herman Murray Jacoby attended the coronation as the personal representative of U.S. president Herbert Hoover. Emissaries from Egypt, Turkey, Sweden, Belgium, and Japan were there. British author Evelyn Waugh was also present, penning a contemporary report on the event, and American travel lecturer Burton Holmes shot the only known film footage of the event. One American newspaper report suggested that the celebration had incurred a cost in excess of $3,000,000. Many of those in attendance received lavish gifts; in one instance the Emperor, a Christian, even sent a gold-encased Bible to an American bishop who had not attended the coronation, but who had dedicated a prayer for the Emperor on the day of the coronation.

Selassie introduced Ethiopia&#x27;s first written constitution on 16 July 1931, providing for a bicameral legislature. The constitution kept power in the hands of the nobility, but it did establish democratic standards among the nobility, envisaging a transition to democratic rule: it would prevail &quot;until the people are in a position to elect themselves.&quot; The constitution limited succession to the throne to descendants of Selassie, which had the effect of placing other dynastic princes at the time (including the princes of Tigrai, and even the Emperor&#x27;s loyal cousin Ras Kassa Haile Darge) outside of the line for the throne.

In 1932, the Sultanate of Jimma was formally absorbed into Ethiopia following the death of Sultan Abba Jifar II of Jimma.

===Conflict with Italy===

Ethiopia became the target of renewed Italian imperialist designs in the 1930s. Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist regime was keen to avenge the military defeats Italy had suffered to Ethiopia in the First Italo-Abyssinian War, and to efface the failed attempt by &quot;liberal&quot; Italy to conquer the country, as epitomised by the defeat at Adwa. A conquest of Ethiopia could also empower the cause of fascism and embolden its empire&#x27;s rhetoric. Ethiopia would also provide a bridge between Italy&#x27;s Eritrean and Italian Somaliland possessions. Ethiopia&#x27;s position in the League of Nations did not dissuade the Italians from invading in 1935; the &quot;collective security&quot; envisaged by the League proved useless, and a scandal erupted when the Hoare–Laval Pact revealed that Ethiopia&#x27;s League allies were scheming to appease Italy.

====Mobilisation====

Following the Welwel Incident of 5 December 1934, Selassie joined his northern armies and set up headquarters at Desse in Wollo province. He issued a generalized mobilization order on 3 October 1935. On 19 October 1935, he gave more precise orders for his army to his Commander-in-Chief, Ras Kassa, instructing the men to choose hidden positions, to conserve ammunition, and to avoid wearing conspicuous clothing for fear of air attack. Compared to the Ethiopians, the Italians had an advanced, modern military that included a large air force. The Italians also came to employ chemical weapons throughout the conflict, even targeting Red Cross field hospitals.

====Progress of the war====
Starting in early October 1935, the Italians invaded Ethiopia. But, by November, the pace of invasion had slowed appreciably, and Selassie&#x27;s northern armies were able to launch what was known as the &quot;Christmas Offensive&quot;. During this offensive, the Italians were forced back in places and put on the defensive. In early 1936, the First Battle of Tembien stopped the progress of the Ethiopian offensive and the Italians were ready to continue their offensive. Following the defeat and destruction of the northern Ethiopian armies at the Battle of Amba Aradam, the Second Battle of Tembien, and the Battle of Shire, Selassie took the field with the last Ethiopian army on the northern front. On 31 March 1936, he launched a counterattack against the Italians himself at the Battle of Maychew in southern Tigray. The Emperor&#x27;s army was defeated and retreated in disarray. As his army withdrew, the Italians attacked from the air along with rebellious Raya and Azebo tribesmen on the ground, who were armed and paid by the Italians. Many of the Ethiopian military were obsolete compared to the invading Italian forces, possessing mostly untrained and non-modern rifles and weaponry.

Selassie made a solitary pilgrimage to the churches at Lalibela, at considerable risk of capture, before returning to his capital. After a stormy session of the council of state, it was agreed that because Addis Ababa could not be defended, the government would relocate to the southern town of Gore, and that in the interest of preserving the imperial house, Empress Menen Asfaw and the rest of the imperial family should immediately depart for French Somaliland, and from there continue on to Jerusalem.

====Exile debate====

After further debate as to whether Selassie should go to Gore or accompany his family into exile, it was agreed that he should leave Ethiopia with his family and present the case of Ethiopia to the League of Nations at Geneva. The decision was not unanimous and several participants, including the nobleman Blatta Tekle Wolde Hawariat, strenuously objected to the idea of an Ethiopian monarch fleeing before an invading force. Selassie appointed his cousin Ras Imru Haile Selassie as Prince Regent in his absence, departing with his family for French Somaliland on 2 May 1936.

On 5 May, Marshal Pietro Badoglio led Italian troops into Addis Ababa, and Mussolini declared Ethiopia an Italian province. Victor Emanuel III was proclaimed as the new Emperor of Ethiopia. On the previous day, the Ethiopian exiles had left French Somaliland aboard the British cruiser HMS &quot;Enterprise&quot;. They were bound for Jerusalem in the British Mandate of Palestine, where the Ethiopian imperial family maintained a residence. The family disembarked at Haifa and then went on to Jerusalem. Once there, Selassie and his retinue prepared to make their case at Geneva. The choice of Jerusalem was highly symbolic, since the Solomonic Dynasty claimed descent from the House of David. Leaving the Holy Land, Selassie and his entourage sailed aboard the British cruiser HMS &quot;Capetown&quot; for Gibraltar, where he stayed at the Rock Hotel. From Gibraltar, the exiles were transferred to an ordinary liner. By doing this, the United Kingdom government was spared the expense of a state reception.

====Collective security and the League of Nations, 1936====

On 12 May 1936, the League of Nations allowed Selassie to address the assembly. In response, Italy withdrew its League delegation. Although fluent in French, Selassie chose to deliver his speech in his native Amharic. He asserted that Italy was employing chemical weapons on military and civilian targets alike.

At the beginning of 1936, &quot;Time&quot; named Selassie &quot;Man of the Year&quot; for 1935, and his June 1936 speech made him an icon for anti-fascists around the world. He failed, however, to get the diplomatic and matériel support he needed. The League agreed to only partial sanctions on Italy, and Selassie was left without much-needed military equipment. Only six nations in 1937 did not recognise Italy&#x27;s occupation: China, New Zealand, the Soviet Union, the Republic of Spain, Mexico and the United States.

====Exile====

Selassie spent his exile years (1936–1941) in Bath, England, in Fairfield House, which he bought. The Emperor and Kassa Haile Darge took morning walks together behind the 14-room Victorian house&#x27;s high walls. His favorite reading was &quot;diplomatic history&quot;. It was during his exile in England that he began writing his 90,000-word autobiography.

Prior to Fairfield House, he briefly stayed at Warne&#x27;s Hotel in Worthing and in Parkside, Wimbledon. A bust of Haile Selassie by Hilda Seligman stood in nearby Cannizaro Park to commemorate his stay, and was a popular place of pilgrimage for London&#x27;s Rastafari community, until it was destroyed by protestors on 30 June 2020. Selassie stayed at the Abbey Hotel in Malvern in the 1930s, and his granddaughters and daughters of court officials were educated at Clarendon School for Girls in North Malvern. During his time in Malvern, he attended services at Holy Trinity Church, in Link Top. A blue plaque commemorating his stay in Malvern was unveiled on Saturday, 25 June 2011. As part of the ceremony, a delegation from the Rastafari movement gave a short address and a drum recital.

Selassie&#x27;s activity in this period was focused on countering Italian propaganda as to the Ethiopian resistance and the legality of the occupation. He spoke out against the desecration of houses of worship and historical artifacts, including the theft of a 1,600-year-old imperial obelisk, and condemned the atrocities suffered by the Ethiopian civilian population. He continued to plead for League intervention and to voice his certainty that &quot;God&#x27;s judgment will eventually visit the weak and the mighty alike&quot;, though his attempts to gain support for the struggle against Italy were largely unsuccessful until Italy entered World War II on the German side in June 1940.

Selassie&#x27;s pleas for international support took root in the United States, particularly among African-American organisations sympathetic to the Ethiopian cause. In 1937, Haile Selassie was to give a Christmas Day radio address to the American people to thank his supporters when his taxi was involved in a traffic accident, leaving him with a fractured knee. He delivered the address despite his injury, in which he linked Christianity and goodwill with the Covenant of the League of Nations, and asserted that war can be resolved diplomatically.

During this period, Selassie suffered several personal tragedies. His two sons-in-law, Ras Desta Damtew and Dejazmach Beyene Merid, were both executed by the Italians. The Emperor&#x27;s daughter, Princess Romanework, wife of Dejazmach Beyene Merid, was taken into captivity with her children, and she died in Italy in 1941. His daughter Tsehai died during childbirth shortly after the restoration in 1942.

After his return to Ethiopia, Selassie donated Fairfield House to the city of Bath as a residence for the aged. In 2019, two blue plaques commemorating his residence at Fairfield and his visits to nearby Weston-super-Mare were unveiled by his grandson.

=== 1940s and 1950s ===
British forces, which consisted primarily of Ethiopian-backed African and South African colonial troops under the &quot;Gideon Force&quot; of Colonel Orde Wingate, coordinated the military effort to liberate Ethiopia. Selassie issued several imperial proclamations in this period, demonstrating that British military might and the Emperor&#x27;s popular appeal could be joined in the concerted effort to liberate Ethiopia.

On 18 January 1941, during the East African Campaign, Selassie crossed the border between Sudan and Ethiopia, near the village of Um Iddla. The standard of the Lion of Judah was raised again. Two days later, he and a force of Ethiopian patriots joined with Gideon Force, which was already in Ethiopia and preparing the way.

Italy was defeated by combined forces of the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth of Nations, Free France, Free Belgium, and Ethiopian partisans. On 5 May 1941, Selassie entered Addis Ababa and personally addressed the Ethiopian people, exactly five years after the fascist forces entered Addis Ababa. He urged them not to reciprocate the atrocities they had been subjected to.

On 27 August 1942, Selassie confirmed the legal basis for the abolition of slavery that had been illegally enacted by Italian occupying forces throughout the empire and imposed severe penalties, including death, for slave trading. After World War II, Ethiopia became a charter member of the United Nations. In 1948, the Ogaden, a region disputed with both Italian Somaliland and British Somaliland, was granted to Ethiopia. On 2 December 1950, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 390 (V), establishing the federation of Eritrea (the former Italian colony) into Ethiopia. Eritrea was to have its own constitution, which would provide for ethnic, linguistic, and cultural balance, while Ethiopia was to manage its finances, defense, and foreign policy.

Despite his centralisation policies that had been made before World War II, Selassie still found himself unable to push for all the programmes he wanted. In 1942, he attempted to institute a progressive tax scheme, but this failed due to opposition from the nobility, and only a flat tax was passed; in 1951, he agreed to reduce this as well. Ethiopia was still &quot;semi-feudal&quot;, and the Emperor&#x27;s attempts to alter its social and economic form by reforming its modes of taxation met with resistance from the nobility and clergy, which were eager to resume their privileges in the post-war era. Where Selassie actually did succeed in effecting new land taxes, the burdens were often still passed by the landowners onto the peasants.

Between 1941 and 1959, Selassie worked to establish the autocephaly of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church had been headed by the &quot;Abuna&quot;, a bishop who answered to the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. In 1942 and 1945, Selassie applied to the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church to establish the independence of Ethiopian bishops, and when his appeals were denied he threatened to sever relations with the Coptic Church of Alexandria. Finally, in 1959, Pope Kyrillos VI elevated the &quot;Abuna&quot; to Patriarch-Catholicos. The Ethiopian Church remained affiliated with the Alexandrian Church. In addition to these efforts, Selassie changed the Ethiopian church-state relationship by introducing taxation of church lands, and by restricting the legal privileges of the clergy, who had formerly been tried in their own courts for civil offenses.

In 1956, on a state visit to India, he met with Indian leaders who supported Ethiopia against fascist Italy&#x27;s illegal occupation during the 1935–1941 war against the country. He also discussed with Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru relating to Asian and African decolonisation, and cooperation between economic and education sectors.

In 1948, Harari and Somali Muslims staged a significant rebellion against the empire in Harar. The state responded with a violent crackdown. Hundreds were arrested and the entire town of Harar was put under house arrest. The government also seized many assets and estates belonging to the people. This led to a massive exodus of Hararis from the region. Harari dissatisfaction stemmed from the fact that they had never received autonomy for Harar, which was promised by Menelik II after his conquest of the kingdom. The promise was eroded by successive Amhara governors of Harar and infringed by Selassie himself. According to historians Tim Carmicheal and Roman Loimeier, Selassie was directly involved in the suppression of the Harari movement that formed as a response to the crackdown on Hararis who collaborated with the Italians during their occupation of Ethiopia from 1935 to 1941.

In keeping with the principle of collective security, for which he was an outspoken proponent, Selassie sent a contingent, under General Mulugueta Bulli, known as the Kagnew Battalion, to take part in the Korean War by supporting the United Nations Command. It was attached to the American 7th Infantry Division, and fought in a number of engagements including the Battle of Pork Chop Hill. In a 1954 speech, Selassie spoke of Ethiopian participation in the Korean War as a redemption of the principles of collective security.

During the celebrations of his Silver Jubilee in November 1955, Selassie introduced a revised constitution, whereby he retained effective power, while extending political participation to the people by allowing the lower house of parliament to become an elected body. Party politics were not provided for. Modern educational methods were more widely spread throughout the Empire.

The country embarked on a development scheme and plans for modernisation, tempered by Ethiopian traditions, and within the framework of the state&#x27;s ancient monarchical structure. Selassie compromised, when practical, with the traditionalists in the nobility and church. He also tried to improve relations between the state and ethnic groups, and granted autonomy to Afar lands that were difficult to control. Still, his reforms to end feudalism were slow and weakened by the compromises he made with the entrenched aristocracy. The revised constitution of 1955 has been criticised for reasserting &quot;the indisputable power of the monarch&quot; and maintaining the relative powerlessness of the peasants.

Selassie also maintained cordial relations with the government of the United Kingdom through charitable gestures. He sent aid to the British government in 1947 when Britain was affected by heavy flooding. His letter to Lord Meork, National Distress Fund, London said, &quot;even though We are busy of helping our people who didn&#x27;t recover from the crises of the war, We heard that your fertile and beautiful country is devastated by the unusually heavy rain, and your request for aid. Therefore, We are sending small amount of money, about one thousand pounds through our embassy to show our sympathy and cooperation.&quot;

==== 1958 famine of Tigray ====

In the summer of 1958, a widespread famine in the Tigray province of northern Ethiopia was already two years old yet people in Addis Ababa knew hardly anything about it. When significant reports of death finally reached the Ministry of Interior in September 1959 the central government immediately disclosed the information to the public and began asking for contributions. The Emperor personally donated 2,000 tons of relief grain, the U.S. sent 32,000 tons, which was distributed between Eritrea and Tigray, and money for aid was raised throughout the country but it is estimated that approximately 100,000 people had died before the crisis ended in August 1961. The causes of the famine were attributed to drought, locusts, hailstone and epidemics of small-pox, typhus, measles and malaria.

===1960s===
Selassie contributed Ethiopian troops to the United Nations Operation in the Congo peacekeeping force during the 1960 Congo Crisis, per United Nations Security Council Resolution 143. On 13 December 1960, while Selassie was on a state visit to Brazil, the imperial guard staged an unsuccessful coup, briefly proclaiming Selassie&#x27;s elder son, Asfa Wossen, as emperor. The regular army and police forces crushed the coup d&#x27;état. The attempt lacked broad popular support, was denounced by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and was unpopular with the military and police. Nonetheless, the effort had support among students and the educated classes. The attempt has been characterised as a pivotal moment in Ethiopian history, the point at which Ethiopians &quot;for the first time questioned the power of the king to rule without the people&#x27;s consent&quot;. Student populations began to empathise with the peasantry and poor and advocate on their behalf. The coup spurred Selassie to accelerate reform, manifested as land grants to military and police officials and political groups.

Selassie continued to be a staunch ally of the West, while pursuing a firm policy of decolonisation in Africa, which was still largely under European colonial rule. The United Nations conducted a lengthy inquiry regarding Eritrea&#x27;s status, with the superpowers each vying for a stake in the state&#x27;s future. Britain, the administrator at the time, suggested Eritrea&#x27;s partition between Sudan and Ethiopia, separating Christians and Muslims. The idea was instantly rejected by Eritrean political parties, as well as the UN.

A UN plebiscite voted to have Eritrea federated with Ethiopia, later stipulated on 2 December 1950 in resolution 390 (V). Eritrea would have its own parliament and administration and would be represented in what had been the Ethiopian parliament and would become the federal parliament. Selassie rejected European attempts to draft a separate constitution under which Eritrea would be governed, and wanted his own 1955 constitution protecting families to apply in both Ethiopia and Eritrea. In 1961 the 30-year Eritrean War for Independence began, followed by the dissolution of the federation and shutting down of Eritrea&#x27;s parliament.

In September 1961, Selassie attended the Summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade, FPR Yugoslavia. This is considered to be the founding conference of the Non-Aligned Movement.

In 1961, tensions between independence-minded Eritreans and Ethiopian forces culminated in the Eritrean War of Independence. Eritrea&#x27;s elected parliament voted to become the fourteenth province of Ethiopia in 1962. The war would continue for 30 years; first Selassie, then the Soviet-backed junta that succeeded him, attempted to retain Eritrea by force.

In 1963, Selassie presided over the formation of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), the precursor of the continent-wide African Union (AU). The new organisation would establish its headquarters in Addis Ababa. In May of that year, Selassie was elected as the OAU&#x27;s first official chairperson, a rotating seat. Along with Modibo Keïta of Mali, the Ethiopian leader would later help successfully negotiate the Bamako Accords, which brought an end to the border conflict between Morocco and Algeria. In 1964, Selassie would initiate the concept of the United States of Africa, a proposition later taken up by Muammar Gaddafi.

In 1963, a revolt in Bale occurred, where peasant rioters whom were discouraged by the Ethiopian taxation headed by Prime Minister Aklilu Habte-Wold later turned into an insurgency. This caused a semi-civil war with terrorist activities carried out by rebels supported by Somalia which later forced the Ethiopian government to declare a state of emergency. The Emperor&#x27;s armed forces led by Prime Minister Aklilu&#x27;s cabinet with the support of the United Kingdom and the United States were able to end the revolt after over six years of insurgency. This assured weakened diplomatic ties with Siad Barre&#x27;s Somalia.

On 4 October 1963, Selassie addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations

On 25 November 1963, the Emperor traveled to Washington, D.C., and attended the state funeral of assassinated U.S. president John F. Kennedy. He was the only African head of state to attend the funeral. In addition, he was the only one of the three prominent world leaders that would have another meeting with the new president, Lyndon B. Johnson, in Washington during his presidency; he met Johnson again during an informal visit to the United States in 1967.

In 1966, Selassie attempted to replace the historical tax system with a single progressive income tax, which would weaken the nobility who had avoided paying most of their taxes. This law led to a revolt in Gojjam, which was repressed although enforcement of the tax was abandoned. Having achieved its design in undermining the tax, the revolt encouraged other landowners to defy Selassie. In October that year, Selassie had a four-day visit to the Kingdom of Jordan hosted by King Hussein. During this trip, Selassie visited Jerusalem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

While he had assured Ethiopia&#x27;s participation in UN-approved collective security operations, including Korea and Congo, Selassie drew a distinction between it and the intervention in Indochina, deploring it as needless suffering and calling for the Vietnam War to end. At the same time, he remained open toward the United States, commending it for making progress with African Americans&#x27; Civil Rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s and visiting the US several times during these years.

In 1967, he visited Montréal, Canada, to open the Ethiopian Pavilion at the Expo &#x27;67 World&#x27;s Fair where he received great acclaim among other World leaders there for the occasion.

Student unrest became a regular feature of Ethiopian life in the 1960s and 1970s. Communism took root among the Ethiopian intelligentsia, particularly those who had studied abroad and been exposed to radical and left-wing sentiments. Resistance by conservatives at the Imperial Court and Parliament, and by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, made Selassie&#x27;s land reform proposals difficult to implement. The standing of the government was damaged, costing Selassie much goodwill and sowing resentment among the peasant population. Efforts to weaken unions also hurt his image. As these issues began to pile up, Selassie left much of domestic governance to Aklilu Habte-Wold and concentrated more on foreign affairs. Over the previous two decades, Ethiopia had received over 400 million dollars in aid, 140 million of that being for the Ethiopian military, and 240 million for economic assistance.

=== 1970s ===
Outside Ethiopia, Selassie continued to enjoy enormous prestige and respect. As the longest-serving head of state in power, he was often given precedence over other leaders at state events, such as the state funerals of John F. Kennedy and Charles de Gaulle, the summits of the Non-Aligned Movement, and the 1971 celebration of the 2,500 years of the Persian Empire. In 1970, he visited Italy as a guest of President Giuseppe Saragat, and in Milan he met Giordano Dell&#x27;Amore, President of the Italian Savings Banks Association. He visited China in October 1971, and was the first foreign head of state to meet Mao Zedong following the death of Mao&#x27;s designated successor Lin Biao in a plane crash in Mongolia.

In the last years of his rule, civil liberties and political rights in Ethiopia were low, with Freedom House giving Ethiopia a &quot;Not Free&quot; score in both categories. Common human rights abuses included poor prison conditions and the imprisonment and torture of political dissidents. Nonetheless, the Emperor was known for pardoning hundreds of prisoners at a time and there were no more than ten political prisoners during his entire reign.
The Imperial Ethiopian Army also carried out a number of atrocities while fighting the Eritrean separatists. There were a number of mass killings of hundreds of civilians during the war in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Selassie went to meet Pope Paul VI in 1970 at Vatican City, where they discussed issues regarding both their countries and history. Selassie&#x27;s political influence was significant; he kept an eye on Ethiopia&#x27;s political status through four spy agencies all which coherently spy on each other and civilian and military aspects of the nation. He was the only person who knew the &#x27;true&#x27; scope of things in Ethiopia.

==== Wollo famine ====


Faminemostly in Wollo, north-eastern Ethiopia, as well as in some parts of Tigrayis estimated to have killed 40,000 to 80,000 Ethiopians between 1972 and 1974. Some reports suggest that the Emperor was unaware of the famine&#x27;s extent, while others assert that he was well aware of it. The famine and its image in the media undermined the government&#x27;s popular support, and his once unassailable popularity declined.

In addition to the exposure of attempts by corrupt local officials to cover up the famine from the imperial government, the Kremlin&#x27;s depiction of Selassie&#x27;s Ethiopia as backwards and inept (relative to the purported utopia of Marxism–Leninism) contributed to the popular uprising that led to its downfall and the rise of Mengistu Haile Mariam. The crisis was exacerbated by military mutinies and high oil prices. The costs of imported goods, gasoline, and food skyrocketed, while unemployment spiked.

====Revolution====
In February 1974, four days of serious riots in Addis Ababa against sudden economic inflation left five dead. The Emperor responded by announcing on national television a reduction in petrol prices and a freeze on the cost of basic commodities. This calmed the public, but the promised 33% military wage hike was not substantial enough to pacify the army, which then mutinied, beginning in Asmara and spreading throughout the empire. This mutiny led to the resignation of Aklilu Habte-Wold as prime minister on 27 February 1974. Selassie again went on television to agree to the army&#x27;s demands for still greater pay, and named Endelkachew Makonnen as the new prime minister. Despite Endalkatchew&#x27;s many concessions, discontent continued in March with a four-day general strike that paralyzed the nation.

====Imprisonment====

The Derg, a committee of low-ranking military officers and enlisted men, set up in June to investigate the military&#x27;s demands, took advantage of the government&#x27;s disarray to depose the 82-year-old Selassie on General Aman Mikael Andom, a Protestant of Eritrean origin, served briefly as provisional head of state pending the return of Crown Prince Asfa Wossen, who was then receiving medical treatment abroad. Selassie was placed under house arrest briefly at the 4th Army Division in Addis Ababa. At the same time, most of his family was detained at the late Duke of Harar&#x27;s residence in the north of the capital. The last months of the Emperor&#x27;s life were spent in imprisonment at the Grand Palace.

Later, most of the imperial family was imprisoned in Addis Ababa&#x27;s Kerchele Prison, also known as &quot;Alem Bekagn&quot;. On 23 November 60 former high officials of the imperial government were executed by firing squad without trial, which included Selassie&#x27;s grandson Iskinder Desta, a rear admiral, as well as General Aman and two former prime ministers. These killings, known to Ethiopians as &quot;Black Saturday&quot;, were condemned by the Crown Prince; the Derg responded to his rebuke by revoking its acknowledgment of his imperial legitimacy, and announcing the end of the Solomonic dynasty.

====Assassination and burial====

On 27 August 1975, Selassie was murdered by military officers of the Derg regime, a fact that remained undiscovered for another twenty years. On 28 August 1975, state media reported that Selassie had died on 27 August of &quot;respiratory failure&quot; following complications from a prostate examination followed up by a prostate operation. Dr. Asrat Woldeyes denied that complications had occurred and rejected the government version of his death. The prostate operation in question apparently had taken place months before the state media claimed, and Selassie had apparently enjoyed strong health in his last days.

In 1994, an Ethiopian court found several former military officers guilty of strangling the Emperor in his bed in 1975. Three years after the Derg regime was overthrown, the court charged them with genocide and murder, claiming that it had obtained documents attesting to a high-level order from the military regime to assassinate Selassie for leading a &quot;feudal regime&quot;. Documents have been widely circulated online showing the Derg&#x27;s final assassination order and bearing the military regime&#x27;s seal and signature. The veracity of these documents has been corroborated by multiple former members of the military Derg regime.

The Soviet-backed People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Derg&#x27;s successor, fell in 1991. In 1992, Selassie&#x27;s bones were found under a concrete slab on the palace grounds, Selassie&#x27;s coffin rested in Bhata Church for nearly a decade, near his great-uncle Menelik II&#x27;s resting place. On 5 November 2000, the Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa gave him a funeral, but the government refused calls to declare the ceremony an official imperial funeral. This may have been due to the government&#x27;s lack of giving encouragement and subtle political recognition to Royalists.

Prominent Rastafari figures such as Rita Marley participated in the funeral, but most Rastafari rejected the event and refused to accept that the bones were Selassie&#x27;s remains. There is some debate within the Rastafari movement whether he actually died in 1975.

== Rastafari messiah ==

Selassie is worshipped as God incarnate among some followers of the Rastafari movement (taken from Selassie&#x27;s pre-imperial name &quot;Ras&quot;meaning &quot;Head&quot;, a title looking equivalent to DukeTafari Makonnen), which emerged in Jamaica during the 1930s. He is viewed as the messiah who will lead the peoples of Africa and the African diaspora to freedom. His official titles are &quot;Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah&quot; and &quot;King of Kings of Ethiopia, Lord of Lords and Elect of God&quot;, and his lineage is thought to be from Solomon and Sheba. These notions are perceived by Rastafari as confirmation of the return of the messiah in the Book of Revelation. Rastafari faith in the divinity of Selassie began after news reports of his coronation reached Jamaica, particularly via the two &quot;Time&quot; magazine articles on the coronation before and after the event. Selassie&#x27;s own perspectives permeate the philosophy of the movement.

In 1961, the Jamaican government sent a delegation of both Rastafari and non-Rastafari leaders to Ethiopia to discuss repatriation with the Emperor. He told the Rastafari delegation &quot;Tell the Brethren to be not dismayed, I personally will give my assistance in the matter of repatriation.&quot;

Selassie visited Jamaica on 21 April 1966, and approximately one hundred thousand Rastafari went to Palisadoes Airport in Kingston to greet him. Spliffs and chalices were openly smoked, causing &quot;a haze of ganja smoke&quot; to drift through the air. Selassie arrived at the airport but was unable to come down the airplane&#x27;s steps, as the crowd rushed the tarmac. He returned into the plane. The Jamaican authorities were obliged to request Ras Mortimer Planno, a well-known Rasta leader, to climb the steps, enter the plane, and negotiate the Emperor&#x27;s descent. This day is held by scholars to be a turning point for the movement, and it is commemorated by Rastafari as Grounation Day. From then on, the Jamaican authorities were asked to ensure that Rastafari representatives were present at all state functions attended by the Emperor, and Rastafari elders also ensured that they obtained a private audience with the Emperor, where he told them that they should not emigrate to Ethiopia until they had first liberated the people of Jamaica. This dictum came to be known as &quot;liberation before repatriation&quot;.

Selassie defied expectations of the Jamaican authorities and never rebuked the Rastafari for their belief in him as God. Instead, he presented the movement&#x27;s faithful elders with gold medallions. During PNP leader (later Jamaican prime minister) Michael Manley&#x27;s visit to Ethiopia in October 1969, the Emperor recalled his 1966 reception with amazement, and stated that he felt that he had to be respectful of their beliefs. This was the visit when Manley received the Rod of Correction or Rod of Joshua as a present from the Emperor, thought to have helped him to win the 1972 election in Jamaica.

Rita Marley converted to the Rastafari faith after seeing Selassie on his Jamaican trip. She claimed that she saw a &quot;stigmata&quot; print on the palm of Selassie&#x27;s hand as he waved to the crowd. Rastafari became much better known throughout much of the world due to the popularity of Bob Marley. Marley&#x27;s posthumously released song &quot;Iron Lion Zion&quot; may refer to Selassie.

=== Selassie&#x27;s position ===

In a 1967 interview with the CBC&#x27;s Bill McNeil, Selassie denied his alleged divinity. For many Rastafari, the CBC interview is not interpreted as a denial. According to Robert Earl Hood, Selassie neither denied nor affirmed his divinity.

After his return to Ethiopia, Selassie dispatched Archbishop Abuna Yesehaq Mandefro to the Caribbean. According to Yesehaq, this was to help draw Rastafari and other West Indians to the Ethiopian church. Some sources suggest that certain islanders and their leaders were resenting the services of their former colonial churches, and vocalised their interest of establishing the Ethiopian church in the Caribbean.

In 1969, Manley visited the Emperor at his palace in Addis Ababa before his election as prime minister of Jamaica in 1972. Selassie spoke about his 1966 visit to Jamaica and told Manley that, though he was confused by the Rastafarians&#x27; beliefs, he respected them.

In 1948, Selassie donated 500 hectares of land at Shashamane, south of Addis Ababa, to the Ethiopian World Federation Incorporated for the use of people of African descent who supported Ethiopia during the war. Numerous Rastafari families settled there and still live as a community to this day. This was controversial among the locals, as the Rastas settled on traditionally Oromo land.

== Residences and finance ==

In 1974, Ethiopian media during the revolution claimed the Emperor had a net worth of 11 billion dollars. However, records indicate that
Selassie&#x27;s entire net worth was just £22,000.00 as late as 1959. He was also accused by the Derg to have hoarded millions in Swiss banks, claiming Selassie illegally acquired the money from exploiting the Ethiopian people.

The Jubilee Palace, built in 1955, served as the official residence of the head of state of Ethiopian Empire from 1955 to 1974. The Palace sits on in the center of Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia since 1889. The Palace&#x27;s estimated initial construction cost and its value today are undisclosed, but due to its size, location and historical importance, its value would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Selassie owned a large fleet of cars including ones gifted to him during overseas visits, which may be worth millions of dollars. In addition, a battle took place over a decade regarding his Patek Phillipe watch, which was initially offered in a Christie&#x27;s auction with an estimated value of over $1 million. However, after the feud ended, the watch was withdrawn from the auction.

== Personal life ==

=== Visual, performing, and literary arts ===

In his private life, Selassie advocated the growth of Ethiopian art. He believed that arts could &#x27;rebuild&#x27; the country. He was interested in a modern outlook towards traditional Ethiopian arts, including those of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. He addressed Afewerk Tekle, an Ethiopian laureate, when he left for Europe to gain skills to improve Ethiopian art. Later, Tekle created multiple artworks putting Ethiopian life on display. Selassie created an art program which enrolled multiple artists, including Agegnehu Engida. He gave a scholarship to Ale Felege Selam. Selassie travelled regularly to Bishoftu to see displays of paintings by Ethiopian artists such as Lemma Guya. Selassie was impressed by Guya&#x27;s paintings of Ethiopian military aircraft. Guya later joined the Airforce but continued to paint with Selassie&#x27;s support.
Selassie commissioned the opening of Ethiopia&#x27;s first Hager Fikir Theater House in 1935 and the National Theatre in Addis Ababa in 1955.

Selassie wrote an autobiography, &quot;My Life and Ethiopia&#x27;s Progress&quot;, covering his years as ruler. He began the first volume while in exile during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. He allegedly wrote the second volume towards the end of the war, though it is widely believed that officials assembled the materials and constructed the book.

=== Sports ===

During his reign, Selassie expanded international Ethiopian sports, including the Ethiopian Football Federation and Ethiopian national basketball team. He awarded Ethiopia the AFCON award when it won its first title. He supported Ethiopia in the 1960 Olympics and gave Olympian Abebe Bikila with multiple national awards such as the Star of Ethiopia and the Order of Menelik II. He supported other Ethiopian athletes, such as Mamo Wolde, by writing personal letters to them.

=== Religion ===

Selassie was an adherent of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. He was raised following Ethiopia&#x27;s traditional Christian background. He was born Tafari Makonnen; after his coronation, he adopted his baptismal name as his official and legal name. He participated in the 1966 Berlin Congress for World Evangelism organised by evangelist Billy Graham.

He tried to unify the Oriental Orthodox community extending into Egypt, Armenia, and Syria. Despite this, he did not try to stop the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church from having its own Patriarch when it was granted autocephaly by the Egyptian Coptic Church. He adhered to the intracontinental and overseas relations between the Orthodox churches, and believed that it would be reasonable to try to move unification forward.
He maintained a good relationship with Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria, Patriarch of the Coptic Church in Egypt. Pope Cyril was awarded the Star of Solomon by Selassie for his role in nominating Abuna Basilios as the first Ethiopian Patriarch of the Tewahedo Church. Christianity played an official role in the Constitutional Monarchy, but to a limited degree compared to his predecessors. Under Selassie&#x27;s reign in 1942, Islamic courts were allowed to have judicial power concerning Muslim matters. He also recognized concerns from the Muslim community and gave audiences to its respective leaders.

=== Family ===

Selassie, being the head of the Royal Family, legally had precedent over all matters within his household. He contrasted with the Solomonic dynasty and gave more political powers, dukedoms, and government offices to members of his immediate family, including his grandson Rear Admiral Iskinder Desta. An individual source according to Paulos Milkias, a professor at Montreal, Canada, claimed that Desta threatened his grandfather with death at gunpoint unless he changed the successional line (although this was never definitively confirmed). Selassie only wanted to give him an apolitical position as a commissioned officer in the Ethiopian military, and Iskinder was made deputy commander of the Imperial Ethiopian Navy in 1958.

In 1963, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh is said to have helped Haile Selassie to put his grandson in the elite Gordonstoun school. Selassie was able to put his other grandchildren into top schools throughout the U.S. and Europe, such as Columbia University.

== Legacy ==
=== Public opinion and media depiction ===
During the early years of his reign, especially in the 1930s and 1940s when Fascist Italy invaded Ethiopia, media coverage of Selassie was predominantly positive. He was portrayed as a hero resisting fascist forces and a symbol of hope for Africa, aligning with the Allies during World War II. In 1935, during the invasion, he was even named &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Man of the Year&quot;. British Pathé reported that Selassie&#x27;s return was &quot;As an Emperor returns and triumphs to his people.&quot; During one of his interviews with &quot;Meet the Press&quot; during a 1963 state visit to the U.S., a time when the Civil Rights movement was in full swing, Selassie condemned race-based oppression and advocated for Pan-African unity. However, media responses were mixed. NBC News ridiculed the visit months later, prompting &quot;The New York Times&quot; to defend the Ethiopian Emperor, questioning NBC&#x27;s intent and criticizing its insensitivity. The paper remarked that &quot;NBC News cannot afford to be a handmaiden of the State Department&quot; and asked what &quot;civilized purpose&quot; was served by ridiculing the visit, to the probable embarrassment of Ethiopian diplomats in the U.S.

During the 1950s, when the Silver Jubilee of the Emperor&#x27;s reign was celebrated, he adopted the 1955 Constitution which legally gave more democratic rights to the public, and legally restricted the monarch&#x27;s power. Following the end of World War II, Selassie sought to limit the influence of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. During the 1950s, he was widely regarded as a modernizing and capable leader in Ethiopia. In the 1970s, due to economic turmoil and a famine, Selassie&#x27;s reputation suffered. Mass protests broke out against his reign. It was widely believed he should abdicate due to his old age and failed land reform policy. These factors ultimately led to his removal from power.

Selassie&#x27;s legacy remains a topic of debate. He played a leading role in founding Addis Ababa University and the Organisation of African Unity, the latter of which would later become the African Union. He was also a prominent anti-colonial leader. &quot;Time&quot; magazine listed him among the most important figures in political history, placing him in the &quot;Top 25 Political Icons&quot; of all time.In 1997, Selassie was mentioned in the Ween song &quot;Mutilated Lips&quot;. In 2001, Ethiopian pop star Teddy Afro released a song titled &quot;Haile Selassie&quot;, depicting its namesake in a nationalistic light.

Selassie appears as a leader of Ethiopia in &quot;Civilization V: Gods and Kings&quot;.

In 2021, a false headline had circulated of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip bowing down to Selassie and his wife during the Queen&#x27;s state visit to Ethiopia at Jubilee Palace. A documentary titled &quot;Grandpa Was an Emperor&quot; was released by Selassie&#x27;s granddaughter in 2021, showcasing the life of the Ethiopian royal family. In the 2024 biopic &quot;Bob Marley: One Love&quot;, Selassie is depicted in Rastafarian religious lore. There is a part where Selassie, whilst riding a horse, takes alongside him a young Bob Marley.

Selassie has been depicted by photographers, artists, and sculptors such as Edward Copnall, Beulah Woodard, Jacob Epstein, William H. Johnson, Yevonde Middleton and Alvin Gittins.

=== Memorials ===

Multiple memorials were built for Selassie, mainly in Ethiopia. One of these memorials was unveiled in 2019 at the African Union&#x27;s Headquarters in Addis Ababa. This memorial was made to honor his long efforts of Pan-Africanism and anti-colonialism during his rule. A wax statue of Haile Selassie can be found in Addis Ababa&#x27;s Unity Park. A high school in Kingston, Jamaica is named after Haile Selassie. In 2020, a bust statue built in 1957 was destroyed by protestors as a response to the assassination of Oromo singer Hachalu Hundessa. One of the three major expressways in Nairobi, Kenya is named after Haile Selassie.

<text>CATIA (, an acronym of computer-aided three-dimensional interactive application) is a multi-platform software suite for computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), computer-aided engineering (CAE), 3D modeling and product lifecycle management (PLM), developed by the French company Dassault Systèmes.

Since it supports multiple stages of product development from conceptualization, design and engineering to manufacturing, it is considered a CAx-software and is sometimes referred to as a 3D product lifecycle management software suite. Like most of its competition, it facilitates collaborative engineering through an integrated cloud service and have support to be used across disciplines including surfacing &amp; shape design, electrical, fluid and electronic systems design, mechanical engineering and systems engineering. CATIA is more popular, among the end users, for its better surface designing characteristics. That&#x27;s why it is most widely used in automobile and aerospace industries.

Besides being used in a wide range of industries from aerospace and defence to packaging design, CATIA has been used by architect Frank Gehry to design some of his signature curvilinear buildings and his company Gehry Technologies was developing their Digital Project software based on CATIA.

The software has been merged with the company&#x27;s other software suite 3D XML Player to form the combined Solidworks Composer Player.

== History ==
CATIA started as an in-house development in 1977 by French aircraft manufacturer Avions Marcel Dassault to provide 3D surface modeling and numerical control functions for the CADAM software they used at that time to develop the Mirage fighter jet. Initially named CATI (&quot;conception assistée tridimensionnelle interactive&quot; – French for &quot;interactive aided three-dimensional design&quot;), it was renamed CATIA in 1981 when Dassault created the subsidiary Dassault Systèmes to develop and sell the software, under the management of its first CEO, Francis Bernard. Dassault Systèmes signed a non-exclusive distribution agreement with IBM, that was also selling CADAM for Lockheed since 1978. Version 1 was released in 1982 as an add-on for CADAM.

During the eighties CATIA saw wider adoption in the aviation and military industries with users such as Boeing and General Dynamics Electric Boat Corp.

Dassault Systèmes purchased CADAM from IBM in 1992, and the next year CATIA CADAM was released. During the nineties CATIA was ported first in 1996 from one to four Unix operating systems, and was entirely rewritten for version 5 in 1998 to support Windows NT. In the years prior to 2000, this caused problems of incompatibility between versions that led to $6.1B in additional costs due to delays in production of the Airbus A380.

With the launch of Dassault Systèmes 3DEXPERIENCE Platform in 2014, CATIA became available as a cloud version.

<text>A () means &quot;governmental district&quot; and is a type of administrative division in Germany. Currently, four of sixteen &#x27; ([[states of Germany]]) are split into&#x27;. Beneath these are rural and urban districts

&#x27; () serve as regional mid-level local government units in four of Germany&#x27;s [[States of Germany|sixteen federal states]]: [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Bavaria]], [[Hesse]] and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. Each of the nineteen&#x27; features a non-legislative governing body called a &#x27; (governing presidium) or&#x27; (district government) headed by a &quot;Regierungspräsident&quot; (governing president), concerned mostly with administrative decisions on a local level for districts within its jurisdiction. Saxony has &quot; (directorate districts) with more responsibilities shifted from the state parliament.

==Translations==
&quot; is a German term variously translated into English as &quot;governmental district&quot;, &quot;administrative district&quot; or &quot;province&quot;, with the first two being the closest literal translations.

==History==
The first &#x27; were established in the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Kingdom of Prussia in 1808. During the course of the Prussian reforms between 1808 and 1816, Prussia subdivided its provinces into 25 &#x27;, eventually featuring 37 such districts within 12 provinces. By 1871, at the time of German unification, the concept of &#x27; had been adopted by most States of the German Empire. Similar entities were initially established in other states under different names, including &#x27; (district captainship) in Saxony, &#x27; (district) in Bavaria and Württemberg (not to be confused with the present-day &#x27; or &#x27; districts), and &quot;province&quot; in Hesse. The names of these equivalent administrative divisions were standardized to &#x27; in Nazi Germany, but after World War II these naming reforms were reverted.

The &quot; in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in modern Germany are in direct continuation of those created in the Prussian Rhine and Westphalia provinces in 1816. never existed in Bremen, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, and Saarland.

In 1946, Lower Saxony was founded by the merger of the three former Free States of Brunswick, Oldenburg, Schaumburg-Lippe, and the former Prussian province of Hanover. Brunswick and Oldenburg became &#x27; (roughly administrative regions of extended competence) alongside six less autonomous Prussian-style &#x27; comprising the Province of Hanover and Schaumburg-Lippe. These differences in autonomy and size were levelled on 1 January 1978, when four &#x27; replaced the two &#x27; and the six &quot;: Brunswick and Oldenburg, Aurich, Hanover (remaining mostly the same), Hildesheim, Lüneburg, Osnabrück and Stade.

Following the reunification of Germany in 1990, the territory of the former East Germany was organized into six re-established new federal states, including a reunified Berlin. Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt established three &quot;&quot; each, while the other new states didn&#x27;t implement them.

===2000s disbandment and reorganization===
During the 2000s, four German states discontinued the use of &#x27;. On 1 January 2000, Rhineland-Palatinate disbanded its three &#x27; of Koblenz, Rheinhessen-Pfalz and Trier. The employees and assets of the three &#x27; () were converted into three public authorities responsible for the whole state, each covering a part of the former responsibilities of the &#x27; ().

On 1 January 2004, Saxony-Anhalt disbanded its three &#x27; of Dessau, Halle and Magdeburg. The responsibilities are now covered by a &#x27; (state administration office) with three offices at the former seats of the &#x27;. On 1 January 2005, Lower Saxony followed suit, disbanding its remaining four &#x27; of Brunswick, Hanover, Lüneburg, and Weser-Ems.

On 1 August 2008, Saxony restructured its &#x27; (), changed the name of its &#x27; to &#x27; (directorate districts), and moved some responsibilities to the districts. The &#x27; were still named &quot;Chemnitz&quot;, &quot;Dresden&quot;, and &quot;Leipzig&quot;, but a border change was necessary because the new district of Mittelsachsen crossed the borders of the old &#x27;. On 1 March 2012, the &#x27; were merged into one &quot;&quot; (state directorate).

== &quot;Regierungsbezirke&quot; by state ==
Currently, only four German states out of 16 in total are divided into &#x27;; all others are directly divided into districts without mid-level agencies. Those four states are divided into a total of 19 &#x27;, ranging in population from 5,255,000 (Düsseldorf) to 1,065,000 (Gießen):

<text>Christiaan Huygens, Lord of Zeelhem, ( , ; ; also spelled Huyghens; ; 14 April 1629 – 8 July 1695) was a Dutch mathematician, physicist, engineer, astronomer, and inventor who is regarded as a key figure in the Scientific Revolution. In physics, Huygens made seminal contributions to optics and mechanics, while as an astronomer he studied the rings of Saturn and discovered its largest moon, Titan. As an engineer and inventor, he improved the design of telescopes and invented the pendulum clock, the most accurate timekeeper for almost 300 years. A talented mathematician and physicist, his works contain the first idealization of a physical problem by a set of mathematical parameters, and the first mathematical and mechanistic explanation of an unobservable physical phenomenon.

Huygens first identified the correct laws of elastic collision in his work &quot;De Motu Corporum ex Percussione&quot;, completed in 1656 but published posthumously in 1703. In 1659, Huygens derived geometrically the formula in classical mechanics for the centrifugal force in his work &quot;De vi Centrifuga&quot;, a decade before Isaac Newton. In optics, he is best known for his wave theory of light, which he described in his &quot;Traité de la Lumière&quot; (1690). His theory of light was initially rejected in favour of Newton&#x27;s corpuscular theory of light, until Augustin-Jean Fresnel adapted Huygens&#x27;s principle to give a complete explanation of the rectilinear propagation and diffraction effects of light in 1821. Today this principle is known as the Huygens–Fresnel principle.

Huygens invented the pendulum clock in 1657, which he patented the same year. His horological research resulted in an extensive analysis of the pendulum in &quot;Horologium Oscillatorium&quot; (1673), regarded as one of the most important 17th century works on mechanics. While it contains descriptions of clock designs, most of the book is an analysis of pendular motion and a theory of curves. In 1655, Huygens began grinding lenses with his brother Constantijn to build refracting telescopes. He discovered Saturn&#x27;s biggest moon, Titan, and was the first to explain Saturn&#x27;s strange appearance as due to &quot;a thin, flat ring, nowhere touching, and inclined to the ecliptic.&quot; In 1662, he developed what is now called the Huygenian eyepiece, a telescope with two lenses to diminish the amount of dispersion.

As a mathematician, Huygens developed the theory of evolutes and wrote on games of chance and the problem of points in &quot;Van Rekeningh in Spelen van Gluck&quot;, which Frans van Schooten translated and published as &quot;De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae&quot; (1657). The use of expected values by Huygens and others would later inspire Jacob Bernoulli&#x27;s work on probability theory.

==Biography==

Christiaan Huygens was born into a rich and influential Dutch family in The Hague on 14 April 1629, the second son of Constantijn Huygens. Christiaan was named after his paternal grandfather. His mother, Suzanna van Baerle, died shortly after giving birth to Huygens&#x27;s sister. The couple had five children: Constantijn (1628), Christiaan (1629), Lodewijk (1631), Philips (1632) and Suzanna (1637).

Constantijn Huygens was a diplomat and advisor to the House of Orange, in addition to being a poet and a musician. He corresponded widely with intellectuals across Europe, including Galileo Galilei, Marin Mersenne, and René Descartes. Christiaan was educated at home until the age of sixteen, and from a young age liked to play with miniatures of mills and other machines. He received a liberal education from his father, studying languages, music, history, geography, mathematics, logic, and rhetoric, alongside dancing, fencing and horse riding.

In 1644, Huygens had as his mathematical tutor Jan Jansz Stampioen, who assigned the 15-year-old a demanding reading list on contemporary science. Descartes was later impressed by his skills in geometry, as was Mersenne, who christened him the &quot;new Archimedes.&quot;

===Student years===
At sixteen years of age, Constantijn sent Huygens to study law and mathematics at Leiden University, where he enrolled from May 1645 to March 1647. Frans van Schooten Jr., professor at Leiden&#x27;s Engineering School, became private tutor to Huygens and his elder brother, Constantijn Jr., replacing Stampioen on the advice of Descartes. Van Schooten brought Huygens&#x27;s mathematical education up to date, particularly on the work of Viète, Descartes, and Fermat.

After two years, starting in March 1647, Huygens continued his studies at the newly founded Orange College, in Breda, where his father was a curator. Constantijn Huygens was closely involved in the new College, which lasted only to 1669; the rector was André Rivet. Christiaan Huygens lived at the home of the jurist Johann Henryk Dauber while attending college, and had mathematics classes with the English lecturer John Pell. His time in Breda ended around the time when his brother Lodewijk, who was enrolled at the school, duelled with another student. Huygens left Breda after completing his studies in August 1649 and had a stint as a diplomat on a mission with Henry, Duke of Nassau. After stays at Bentheim and Flensburg in Germany, he visited Copenhagen and Helsingør in Denmark. Huygens hoped to cross the Øresund to see Descartes in Stockholm but was prevented due to Descartes&#x27; death in the interim.

Although his father Constantijn had wished his son Christiaan to be a diplomat, circumstances kept him from becoming so. The First Stadtholderless Period that began in 1650 meant that the House of Orange was no longer in power, removing Constantijn&#x27;s influence. Further, he realized that his son had no interest in such a career.

===Early correspondence===

Huygens generally wrote in French or Latin. In 1646, while still a college student at Leiden, he began a correspondence with his father&#x27;s friend, Marin Mersenne, who died soon afterwards in 1648. Mersenne wrote to Constantijn on his son&#x27;s talent for mathematics, and flatteringly compared him to Archimedes on 3 January 1647.

The letters show Huygens&#x27;s early interest in mathematics. In October 1646 there is the suspension bridge and the demonstration that a hanging chain is not a parabola, as Galileo thought. Huygens would later label that curve the &quot;catenaria&quot; (catenary) in 1690 while corresponding with Gottfried Leibniz.

In the next two years (1647–48), Huygens&#x27;s letters to Mersenne covered various topics, including a mathematical proof of the law of free fall, the claim by Grégoire de Saint-Vincent of circle quadrature, which Huygens showed to be wrong, the rectification of the ellipse, projectiles, and the vibrating string. Some of Mersenne&#x27;s concerns at the time, such as the cycloid (he sent Huygens Torricelli&#x27;s treatise on the curve), the centre of oscillation, and the gravitational constant, were matters Huygens only took seriously later in the 17th century. Mersenne had also written on musical theory. Huygens preferred meantone temperament; he innovated in 31 equal temperament (which was not itself a new idea but known to Francisco de Salinas), using logarithms to investigate it further and show its close relation to the meantone system.

In 1654, Huygens returned to his father&#x27;s house in The Hague and was able to devote himself entirely to research. The family had another house, not far away at Hofwijck, and he spent time there during the summer. Despite being very active, his scholarly life did not allow him to escape bouts of depression.

Subsequently, Huygens developed a broad range of correspondents, though with some difficulty after 1648 due to the five-year &quot;Fronde&quot; in France. Visiting Paris in 1655, Huygens called on Ismael Boulliau to introduce himself, who took him to see Claude Mylon. The Parisian group of savants that had gathered around Mersenne held together into the 1650s, and Mylon, who had assumed the secretarial role, took some trouble to keep Huygens in touch. Through Pierre de Carcavi Huygens corresponded in 1656 with Pierre de Fermat, whom he admired greatly. The experience was bittersweet and somewhat puzzling since it became clear that Fermat had dropped out of the research mainstream, and his priority claims could probably not be made good in some cases. Besides, Huygens was looking by then to apply mathematics to physics, while Fermat&#x27;s concerns ran to purer topics.

===Scientific debut===

Like some of his contemporaries, Huygens was often slow to commit his results and discoveries to print, preferring to disseminate his work through letters instead. In his early days, his mentor Frans van Schooten provided technical feedback and was cautious for the sake of his reputation.

Between 1651 and 1657, Huygens published a number of works that showed his talent for mathematics and his mastery of classical and analytical geometry, increasing his reach and reputation among mathematicians. Around the same time, Huygens began to question Descartes&#x27;s laws of collision, which were largely wrong, deriving the correct laws algebraically and later by way of geometry. He showed that, for any system of bodies, the centre of gravity of the system remains the same in velocity and direction, which Huygens called the conservation of &quot;quantity of movement&quot;. While others at the time were studying impact, Huygens&#x27;s theory of collisions was more general. These results became the main reference point and the focus for further debates through correspondence and in a short article in &quot;Journal des Sçavans&quot; but would remain unknown to a larger audience until the publication of &quot;De Motu Corporum ex Percussione&quot; (&quot;Concerning the motion of colliding bodies&quot;) in 1703.

In addition to his mathematical and mechanical works, Huygens made important scientific discoveries: he was the first to identify Titan as one of Saturn&#x27;s moons in 1655, invented the pendulum clock in 1657, and explained Saturn&#x27;s strange appearance as due to a ring in 1659; all these discoveries brought him fame across Europe. On 3 May 1661, Huygens, together with astronomer Thomas Streete and Richard Reeve, observed the planet Mercury transit over the Sun using Reeve&#x27;s telescope in London. Streete then debated the published record of Hevelius, a controversy mediated by Henry Oldenburg. Huygens passed to Hevelius a manuscript of Jeremiah Horrocks on the transit of Venus in 1639, printed for the first time in 1662.

In that same year, Sir Robert Moray sent Huygens John Graunt&#x27;s life table, and shortly after Huygens and his brother Lodewijk dabbled on life expectancy. Huygens eventually created the first graph of a continuous distribution function under the assumption of a uniform death rate, and used it to solve problems in joint annuities. Contemporaneously, Huygens, who played the harpsichord, took an interest in Simon Stevin&#x27;s theories on music; however, he showed very little concern to publish his theories on consonance, some of which were lost for centuries. For his contributions to science, the Royal Society of London elected Huygens a Fellow in 1663, making him its first foreign member when he was just 34 years old.

===France===

The Montmor Academy, started in the mid-1650s, was the form the old Mersenne circle took after his death. Huygens took part in its debates and supported those favouring experimental demonstration as a check on amateurish attitudes. He visited Paris a third time in 1663; when the Montmor Academy closed down the next year, Huygens advocated for a more Baconian program in science. Two years later, in 1666, he moved to Paris on an invitation to fill a leadership position at King Louis XIV&#x27;s new French Académie des sciences.

While at the Académie in Paris, Huygens had an important patron and correspondent in Jean-Baptiste Colbert, First Minister to Louis XIV. His relationship with the French Académie was not always easy, and in 1670 Huygens, seriously ill, chose Francis Vernon to carry out a donation of his papers to the Royal Society in London should he die. However, the aftermath of the Franco-Dutch War (1672–78), and particularly England&#x27;s role in it, may have damaged his later relationship with the Royal Society. Robert Hooke, as a Royal Society representative, lacked the finesse to handle the situation in 1673.

The physicist and inventor Denis Papin was an assistant to Huygens from 1671. One of their projects, which did not bear fruit directly, was the gunpowder engine, a precursor of the internal combustion engine that used gunpowder as its fuel. Huygens made further astronomical observations at the Académie using the observatory recently completed in 1672. He introduced Nicolaas Hartsoeker to French scientists such as Nicolas Malebranche and Giovanni Cassini in 1678.

The young diplomat Leibniz met Huygens while visiting Paris in 1672 on a vain mission to meet the French Foreign Minister Arnauld de Pomponne. Leibniz was working on a calculating machine at the time and, after a short visit to London in early 1673, he was tutored in mathematics by Huygens until 1676. An extensive correspondence ensued over the years, in which Huygens showed at first reluctance to accept the advantages of Leibniz&#x27;s infinitesimal calculus.

===Final years===

Huygens moved back to The Hague in 1681 after suffering another bout of serious depressive illness. In 1684, he published &quot;Astroscopia Compendiaria&quot; on his new tubeless aerial telescope. He attempted to return to France in 1685 but the revocation of the Edict of Nantes precluded this move. His father died in 1687, and he inherited Hofwijck, which he made his home the following year.

On his third visit to England, Huygens met Newton in person on 12 June 1689. They spoke about Iceland spar, and subsequently corresponded about resisted motion.

Huygens returned to mathematical topics in his last years and observed the acoustical phenomenon now known as flanging in 1693. Two years later, on 8 July 1695, Huygens died in The Hague and was buried, like his father before him, in an unmarked grave at the Grote Kerk.

Huygens never married.

==Mathematics==
Huygens first became internationally known for his work in mathematics, publishing a number of important results that drew the attention of many European geometers. Huygens&#x27;s preferred method in his published works was that of Archimedes, though he made use of Descartes&#x27;s analytic geometry and Fermat&#x27;s infinitesimal techniques more extensively in his private notebooks.

=== Published works ===
==== &quot;Theoremata de Quadratura&quot; ====

Huygens&#x27;s first publication was &quot;Theoremata de Quadratura Hyperboles, Ellipsis et Circuli&quot; (&quot;Theorems on the quadrature of the hyperbola, ellipse, and circle&quot;), published by the Elzeviers in Leiden in 1651. The first part of the work contained theorems for computing the areas of hyperbolas, ellipses, and circles that paralleled Archimedes&#x27;s work on conic sections, particularly his &quot;Quadrature of the Parabola&quot;. The second part included a refutation to Grégoire de Saint-Vincent&#x27;s claims on circle quadrature, which he had discussed with Mersenne earlier.

Huygens demonstrated that the centre of gravity of a segment of any hyperbola, ellipse, or circle was directly related to the area of that segment. He was then able to show the relationships between triangles inscribed in conic sections and the centre of gravity for those sections. By generalizing these theorems to cover all conic sections, Huygens extended classical methods to generate new results.

Quadrature and rectification were live issues in the 1650s and, through Mylon, Huygens participated in the controversy surrounding Thomas Hobbes. Persisting in highlighting his mathematical contributions, he made an international reputation.

==== &quot;De Circuli Magnitudine Inventa&quot; ====
Huygens&#x27;s next publication was &quot;De Circuli Magnitudine Inventa&quot; (&quot;New findings on the magnitude of the circle&quot;), published in 1654. In this work, Huygens was able to narrow the gap between the circumscribed and inscribed polygons found in Archimedes&#x27;s &quot;Measurement of the Circle&quot;, showing that the ratio of the circumference to its diameter or pi () must lie in the first third of that interval.

Using a technique equivalent to Richardson extrapolation, Huygens was able to shorten the inequalities used in Archimedes&#x27;s method; in this case, by using the centre of the gravity of a segment of a parabola, he was able to approximate the centre of gravity of a segment of a circle, resulting in a faster and accurate approximation of the circle quadrature. From these theorems, Huygens obtained two set of values for : the first between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927, and the second between 3.1415926533 and 3.1415926538.

Huygens also showed that, in the case of the hyperbola, the same approximation with parabolic segments produces a quick and simple method to calculate logarithms. He appended a collection of solutions to classical problems at the end of the work under the title &quot;Illustrium Quorundam Problematum Constructiones&quot; (&quot;Construction of some illustrious problems&quot;).

==== &quot;De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae&quot; ====
Huygens became interested in games of chance after he visited Paris in 1655 and encountered the work of Fermat, Blaise Pascal and Girard Desargues years earlier. He eventually published what was, at the time, the most coherent presentation of a mathematical approach to games of chance in &quot;De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae&quot; (&quot;On reasoning in games of chance&quot;). Frans van Schooten translated the original Dutch manuscript into Latin and published it in his &quot;Exercitationum Mathematicarum&quot; (1657).

The work contains early game-theoretic ideas and deals in particular with the problem of points. Huygens took from Pascal the concepts of a &quot;fair game&quot; and equitable contract (i.e., equal division when the chances are equal), and extended the argument to set up a non-standard theory of expected values. His success in applying algebra to the realm of chance, which hitherto seemed inaccessible to mathematicians, demonstrated the power of combining Euclidean synthetic proofs with the symbolic reasoning found in the works of Viète and Descartes.

Huygens included five challenging problems at the end of the book that became the standard test for anyone wishing to display their mathematical skill in games of chance for the next sixty years. People who worked on these problems included Abraham de Moivre, Jacob Bernoulli, Johannes Hudde, Baruch Spinoza, and Leibniz.

=== Unpublished work ===

Huygens had earlier completed a manuscript in the manner of Archimedes&#x27;s &quot;On Floating Bodies&quot; entitled &quot;De Iis quae Liquido Supernatant&quot; (&quot;About parts floating above liquids&quot;). It was written around 1650 and was made up of three books. Although he sent the completed work to Frans van Schooten for feedback, in the end Huygens chose not to publish it, and at one point suggested it be burned. Some of the results found here were not rediscovered until the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

Huygens first re-derives Archimedes&#x27;s solutions for the stability of the sphere and the paraboloid by a clever application of Torricelli&#x27;s principle (i.e., that bodies in a system move only if their centre of gravity descends). He then proves the general theorem that, for a floating body in equilibrium, the distance between its centre of gravity and its submerged portion is at a minimum. Huygens uses this theorem to arrive at original solutions for the stability of floating cones, parallelepipeds, and cylinders, in some cases through a full cycle of rotation. His approach was thus equivalent to the principle of virtual work. Huygens was also the first to recognize that, for these homogeneous solids, their specific weight and their aspect ratio are the essentials parameters of hydrostatic stability.

==Natural philosophy==
Huygens was the leading European natural philosopher between Descartes and Newton. However, unlike many of his contemporaries, Huygens had no taste for grand theoretical or philosophical systems and generally avoided dealing with metaphysical issues (if pressed, he adhered to the Cartesian philosophy of his time). Instead, Huygens excelled in extending the work of his predecessors, such as Galileo, to derive solutions to unsolved physical problems that were amenable to mathematical analysis. In particular, he sought explanations that relied on contact between bodies and avoided action at a distance.

In common with Robert Boyle and Jacques Rohault, Huygens advocated an experimentally oriented, mechanical natural philosophy during his Paris years. Already in his first visit to England in 1661, Huygens had learnt about Boyle&#x27;s air pump experiments during a meeting at Gresham College. Shortly afterwards, he reevaluated Boyle&#x27;s experimental design and developed a series of experiments meant to test a new hypothesis. It proved a yearslong process that brought to the surface a number of experimental and theoretical issues, and which ended around the time he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. Despite the replication of results of Boyle&#x27;s experiments trailing off messily, Huygens came to accept Boyle&#x27;s view of the void against the Cartesian denial of it.

Newton&#x27;s influence on John Locke was mediated by Huygens, who assured Locke that Newton&#x27;s mathematics was sound, leading to Locke&#x27;s acceptance of a corpuscular-mechanical physics.

===Laws of motion, impact, and gravitation===
==== Elastic collisions ====

The general approach of the mechanical philosophers was to postulate theories of the kind now called &quot;contact action.&quot; Huygens adopted this method but not without seeing its limitations, while Leibniz, his student in Paris, later abandoned it. Understanding the universe this way made the theory of collisions central to physics, as only explanations that involved matter in motion could be truly intelligible. While Huygens was influenced by the Cartesian approach, he was less doctrinaire. He studied elastic collisions in the 1650s but delayed publication for over a decade.

Huygens concluded quite early that Descartes&#x27;s laws for elastic collisions were largely wrong, and he formulated the correct laws, including the conservation of the product of mass times the square of the speed for hard bodies, and the conservation of quantity of motion in one direction for all bodies. An important step was his recognition of the Galilean invariance of the problems. Huygens had worked out the laws of collision from 1652 to 1656 in a manuscript entitled &quot;De Motu Corporum ex Percussione&quot;, though his results took many years to be circulated. In 1661, he passed them on in person to William Brouncker and Christopher Wren in London. What Spinoza wrote to Henry Oldenburg about them in 1666, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, was guarded. The war ended in 1667, and Huygens announced his results to the Royal Society in 1668. He later published them in the &quot;Journal des Sçavans&quot; in 1669.

==== Centrifugal force ====
In 1659 Huygens found the constant of gravitational acceleration and stated what is now known as the second of Newton&#x27;s laws of motion in quadratic form. He derived geometrically the now standard formula for the centrifugal force, exerted on an object when viewed in a rotating frame of reference, for instance when driving around a curve. In modern notation:

:formula_1

with &quot;m&quot; the mass of the object, &quot;ω&quot; the angular velocity, and &quot;r&quot; the radius. Huygens collected his results in a treatise under the title &quot;De vi Centrifuga&quot;, unpublished until 1703, where the kinematics of free fall were used to produce the first generalized conception of force prior to Newton. 

==== Gravitation ====
The general idea for the centrifugal force, however, was published in 1673 and was a significant step in studying orbits in astronomy. It enabled the transition from Kepler&#x27;s third law of planetary motion to the inverse square law of gravitation. Yet, the interpretation of Newton&#x27;s work on gravitation by Huygens differed from that of Newtonians such as Roger Cotes: he did not insist on the &quot;a priori&quot; attitude of Descartes, but neither would he accept aspects of gravitational attractions that were not attributable in principle to contact between particles.

The approach used by Huygens also missed some central notions of mathematical physics, which were not lost on others. In his work on pendulums Huygens came very close to the theory of simple harmonic motion; the topic, however, was covered fully for the first time by Newton in Book II of the &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; (1687). In 1678 Leibniz picked out of Huygens&#x27;s work on collisions the idea of conservation law that Huygens had left implicit.

=== Horology ===
==== Pendulum clock ====
In 1657, inspired by earlier research into pendulums as regulating mechanisms, Huygens invented the pendulum clock, which was a breakthrough in timekeeping and became the most accurate timekeeper for almost 300 years until the 1930s. The pendulum clock was much more accurate than the existing verge and foliot clocks and was immediately popular, quickly spreading over Europe. Clocks prior to this would lose about 15 minutes per day, whereas Huygens&#x27;s clock would lose about 15 seconds per day. Although Huygens patented and contracted the construction of his clock designs to Salomon Coster in The Hague, he did not make much money from his invention. Pierre Séguier refused him any French rights, while Simon Douw in Rotterdam and Ahasuerus Fromanteel in London copied his design in 1658. The oldest known Huygens-style pendulum clock is dated 1657 and can be seen at the Museum Boerhaave in Leiden.

Part of the incentive for inventing the pendulum clock was to create an accurate marine chronometer that could be used to find longitude by celestial navigation during sea voyages. However, the clock proved unsuccessful as a marine timekeeper because the rocking motion of the ship disturbed the motion of the pendulum. In 1660, Lodewijk Huygens made a trial on a voyage to Spain, and reported that heavy weather made the clock useless. Alexander Bruce entered the field in 1662, and Huygens called in Sir Robert Moray and the Royal Society to mediate and preserve some of his rights. Trials continued into the 1660s, the best news coming from a Royal Navy captain Robert Holmes operating against the Dutch possessions in 1664. Lisa Jardine doubts that Holmes reported the results of the trial accurately, as Samuel Pepys expressed his doubts at the time.

A trial for the French Academy on an expedition to Cayenne ended badly. Jean Richer suggested correction for the figure of the Earth. By the time of the Dutch East India Company expedition of 1686 to the Cape of Good Hope, Huygens was able to supply the correction retrospectively.

==== &quot;Horologium Oscillatorium&quot; ====

Sixteen years after the invention of the pendulum clock, in 1673, Huygens published his major work on horology entitled &quot;Horologium Oscillatorium: Sive de Motu Pendulorum ad Horologia Aptato Demonstrationes Geometricae (The Pendulum Clock: or Geometrical demonstrations concerning the motion of pendula as applied to clocks&quot;). It is the first modern work on mechanics where a physical problem is idealized by a set of parameters then analysed mathematically.

Huygens&#x27;s motivation came from the observation, made by Mersenne and others, that pendulums are not quite isochronous: their period depends on their width of swing, with wide swings taking slightly longer than narrow swings. He tackled this problem by finding the curve down which a mass will slide under the influence of gravity in the same amount of time, regardless of its starting point; the so-called tautochrone problem. By geometrical methods which anticipated the calculus, Huygens showed it to be a cycloid, rather than the circular arc of a pendulum&#x27;s bob, and therefore that pendulums needed to move on a cycloid path in order to be isochronous. The mathematics necessary to solve this problem led Huygens to develop his theory of evolutes, which he presented in Part III of his &quot;Horologium Oscillatorium&quot;.

He also solved a problem posed by Mersenne earlier: how to calculate the period of a pendulum made of an arbitrarily-shaped swinging rigid body. This involved discovering the centre of oscillation and its reciprocal relationship with the pivot point. In the same work, he analysed the conical pendulum, consisting of a weight on a cord moving in a circle, using the concept of centrifugal force.

Huygens was the first to derive the formula for the period of an ideal mathematical pendulum (with mass-less rod or cord and length much longer than its swing), in modern notation:

:formula_2

with &quot;T&quot; the period, &quot;l&quot; the length of the pendulum and &quot;g&quot; the gravitational acceleration. By his study of the oscillation period of compound pendulums Huygens made pivotal contributions to the development of the concept of moment of inertia.

Huygens also observed coupled oscillations: two of his pendulum clocks mounted next to each other on the same support often became synchronized, swinging in opposite directions. He reported the results by letter to the Royal Society, and it is referred to as &quot;an odd kind of sympathy&quot; in the Society&#x27;s minutes. This concept is now known as entrainment.

==== Balance spring watch ====

In 1675, while investigating the oscillating properties of the cycloid, Huygens was able to transform a cycloidal pendulum into a vibrating spring through a combination of geometry and higher mathematics. In the same year, Huygens designed a spiral balance spring and patented a pocket watch. These watches are notable for lacking a fusee for equalizing the mainspring torque. The implication is that Huygens thought his spiral spring would isochronize the balance in the same way that cycloid-shaped suspension curbs on his clocks would isochronize the pendulum.

He later used spiral springs in more conventional watches, made for him by Thuret in Paris. Such springs are essential in modern watches with a detached lever escapement because they can be adjusted for isochronism. Watches in Huygens&#x27;s time, however, employed the very ineffective verge escapement, which interfered with the isochronal properties of any form of balance spring, spiral or otherwise.

Huygens&#x27;s design came around the same time as, though independently of, Robert Hooke&#x27;s. Controversy over the priority of the balance spring persisted for centuries. In February 2006, a long-lost copy of Hooke&#x27;s handwritten notes from several decades of Royal Society meetings was discovered in a cupboard in Hampshire, England, presumably tipping the evidence in Hooke&#x27;s favour.

=== Optics ===
==== Dioptrics ====

Huygens had a long-term interest in the study of light refraction and lenses or dioptrics. From 1652 date the first drafts of a Latin treatise on the theory of dioptrics, known as the &quot;Tractatus&quot;, which contained a comprehensive and rigorous theory of the telescope. Huygens was one of the few to raise theoretical questions regarding the properties and working of the telescope, and almost the only one to direct his mathematical proficiency towards the actual instruments used in astronomy.

Huygens repeatedly announced its publication to his colleagues but ultimately postponed it in favor of a much more comprehensive treatment, now under the name of the &quot;Dioptrica&quot;. It consisted of three parts. The first part focused on the general principles of refraction, the second dealt with spherical and chromatic aberration, while the third covered all aspects of the construction of telescopes and microscopes. In contrast to Descartes&#x27; dioptrics which treated only ideal (elliptical and hyperbolical) lenses, Huygens dealt exclusively with spherical lenses, which were the only kind that could really be made and incorporated in devices such as microscopes and telescopes.

Huygens also worked out practical ways to minimize the effects of spherical and chromatic aberration, such as long focal distances for the objective of a telescope, internal stops to reduce the aperture, and a new kind of ocular known as the Huygenian eyepiece. The &quot;Dioptrica&quot; was never published in Huygens’s lifetime and only appeared in press in 1703, when most of its contents were already familiar to the scientific world.

==== Lenses ====
Together with his brother Constantijn, Huygens began grinding his own lenses in 1655 in an effort to improve telescopes. He designed in 1662 what is now called the Huygenian eyepiece, a set of two planoconvex lenses used as a telescope ocular. Huygens&#x27;s lenses were known to be of superb quality and polished consistently according to his specifications; however, his telescopes did not produce very sharp images, leading some to speculate that he might have suffered from near-sightedness.

Lenses were also a common interest through which Huygens could meet socially in the 1660s with Spinoza, who ground them professionally. They had rather different outlooks on science, Spinoza being the more committed Cartesian, and some of their discussion survives in correspondence. He encountered the work of Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, another lens grinder, in the field of microscopy which interested his father. Huygens also investigated the use of lenses in projectors. He is credited as the inventor of the magic lantern, described in correspondence of 1659. There are others to whom such a lantern device has been attributed, such as Giambattista della Porta and Cornelis Drebbel, though Huygens&#x27;s design used lens for better projection (Athanasius Kircher has also been credited for that).

==== &quot;Traité de la Lumière&quot; ====
Huygens is especially remembered in optics for his wave theory of light, which he first communicated in 1678 to the Académie des sciences in Paris. Originally a preliminary chapter of his &quot;Dioptrica&quot;, Huygens&#x27;s theory was published in 1690 under the title &quot;Traité de la Lumière&quot; (&quot;Treatise on light&quot;), and contains the first fully mathematized, mechanistic explanation of an unobservable physical phenomenon (i.e., light propagation). Huygens refers to Ignace-Gaston Pardies, whose manuscript on optics helped him on his wave theory.

The challenge at the time was to explain geometrical optics, as most physical optics phenomena (such as diffraction) had not been observed or appreciated as issues. Huygens had experimented in 1672 with double refraction (birefringence) in the Iceland spar (a calcite), a phenomenon discovered in 1669 by Rasmus Bartholin. At first, he could not elucidate what he found but was later able to explain it using his wavefront theory and concept of evolutes. He also developed ideas on caustics. Huygens assumes that the speed of light is finite, based on a report by Ole Christensen Rømer in 1677 but which Huygens is presumed to have already believed. Huygens&#x27;s theory posits light as radiating wavefronts, with the common notion of light rays depicting propagation normal to those wavefronts. Propagation of the wavefronts is then explained as the result of spherical waves being emitted at every point along the wave front (known today as the Huygens–Fresnel principle). It assumed an omnipresent ether, with transmission through perfectly elastic particles, a revision of the view of Descartes. The nature of light was therefore a longitudinal wave.

His theory of light was not widely accepted, while Newton&#x27;s rival corpuscular theory of light, as found in his &quot;Opticks&quot; (1704), gained more support. One strong objection to Huygens&#x27;s theory was that longitudinal waves have only a single polarization which cannot explain the observed birefringence. However, Thomas Young&#x27;s interference experiments in 1801, and François Arago&#x27;s detection of the Poisson spot in 1819, could not be explained through Newton&#x27;s or any other particle theory, reviving Huygens&#x27;s ideas and wave models. Fresnel became aware of Huygens&#x27;s work and in 1821 was able to explain birefringence as a result of light being not a longitudinal (as had been assumed) but actually a transverse wave. The thus-named Huygens–Fresnel principle was the basis for the advancement of physical optics, explaining all aspects of light propagation until Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic theory culminated in the development of quantum mechanics and the discovery of the photon.

=== Astronomy ===
==== &quot;Systema Saturnium&quot; ====

In 1655, Huygens discovered the first of Saturn&#x27;s moons, Titan, and observed and sketched the Orion Nebula using a refracting telescope with a 43x magnification of his own design. Huygens succeeded in subdividing the nebula into different stars (the brighter interior now bears the name of the &quot;Huygenian region&quot; in his honour), and discovered several interstellar nebulae and some double stars. He was also the first to propose that the appearance of Saturn, which had baffled astronomers, was due to &quot;a thin, flat ring, nowhere touching, and inclined to the ecliptic”.

More than three years later, in 1659, Huygens published his theory and findings in &quot;Systema Saturnium&quot;. It is considered the most important work on telescopic astronomy since Galileo&#x27;s &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot; fifty years earlier. Much more than a report on Saturn, Huygens provided measurements for the relative distances of the planets from the Sun, introduced the concept of the micrometer, and showed a method to measure angular diameters of planets, which finally allowed the telescope to be used as an instrument to measure (rather than just sighting) astronomical objects. He was also the first to question the authority of Galileo in telescopic matters, a sentiment that was to be common in the years following its publication.

In the same year, Huygens was able to observe Syrtis Major, a volcanic plain on Mars. He used repeated observations of the movement of this feature over the course of a number of days to estimate the length of day on Mars, which he did quite accurately to 24 1/2 hours. This figure is only a few minutes off of the actual length of the Martian day of 24 hours, 37 minutes.

==== Planetarium ====
At the instigation of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Huygens undertook the task of constructing a mechanical planetarium that could display all the planets and their moons then known circling around the Sun. Huygens completed his design in 1680 and had his clockmaker Johannes van Ceulen built it the following year. However, Colbert passed away in the interim and Huygens never got to deliver his planetarium to the French Academy of Sciences as the new minister, François-Michel le Tellier, decided not to renew Huygens&#x27;s contract.

In his design, Huygens made an ingenious use of continued fractions to find the best rational approximations by which he could choose the gears with the correct number of teeth. The ratio between two gears determined the orbital periods of two planets. To move the planets around the Sun, Huygens used a clock-mechanism that could go forwards and backwards in time. Huygens claimed his planetarium was more accurate that a similar device constructed by Ole Rømer around the same time, but his planetarium design was not published until after his death in the &quot;Opuscula Posthuma&quot; (1703).

==== &quot;Cosmotheoros&quot; ====

Shortly before his death in 1695, Huygens completed his most speculative work entitled &quot;Cosmotheoros&quot;. At his direction, it was to be published only posthumously by his brother, which Constantijn Jr. did in 1698. In this work, Huygens speculated on the existence of extraterrestrial life, which he imagined similar to that on Earth. Such speculations were not uncommon at the time, justified by Copernicanism or the plenitude principle, but Huygens went into greater detail, though without acknowledging Newton&#x27;s laws of gravitation or the fact that planetary atmospheres are composed of different gases. &quot;Cosmotheoros,&quot; translated into English as &quot;The celestial worlds discover’d&quot;, is fundamentally a utopian work that owes some inspiration to the work of Peter Heylin, and it was likely seen by contemporary readers as a piece of fiction in the tradition of Francis Godwin, John Wilkins, and Cyrano de Bergerac.

Huygens wrote that availability of water in liquid form was essential for life and that the properties of water must vary from planet to planet to suit the temperature range. He took his observations of dark and bright spots on the surfaces of Mars and Jupiter to be evidence of water and ice on those planets. He argued that extraterrestrial life is neither confirmed nor denied by the Bible, and questioned why God would create the other planets if they were not to serve a greater purpose than that of being admired from Earth. Huygens postulated that the great distance between the planets signified that God had not intended for beings on one to know about the beings on the others, and had not foreseen how much humans would advance in scientific knowledge.

It was also in this book that Huygens published his estimates for the relative sizes of the solar system and his method for calculating stellar distances. He made a series of smaller holes in a screen facing the Sun, until he estimated the light was of the same intensity as that of the star Sirius. He then calculated that the angle of this hole was 1/27,664th the diameter of the Sun, and thus it was about 30,000 times as far away, on the (incorrect) assumption that Sirius is as luminous as the Sun. The subject of photometry remained in its infancy until the time of Pierre Bouguer and Johann Heinrich Lambert.

== Legacy ==
Huygens has been called the first theoretical physicist and a founder of modern mathematical physics. Although his influence was considerable during his lifetime, it began to fade shortly after his death. His skills as a geometer and mechanical ingenuity elicited the admiration of many of his contemporaries, including Newton, Leibniz, l&#x27;Hôpital, and the Bernoullis. For his work in physics, Huygens has been deemed one of the greatest scientists in the Scientific Revolution, rivaled only by Newton in both depth of insight and the number of results obtained. Huygens also helped develop the institutional frameworks for scientific research on the European continent, making him a leading actor in the establishment of modern science.

=== Mathematics and physics ===

In mathematics, Huygens mastered the methods of ancient Greek geometry, particularly the work of Archimedes, and was an adept user of the analytic geometry and infinitesimal techniques of Descartes and Fermat. His mathematical style can be best described as geometrical infinitesimal analysis of curves and of motion. Drawing inspiration and imagery from mechanics, it remained pure mathematics in form. Huygens brought this type of geometrical analysis to a close, as more mathematicians turned away from classical geometry to the calculus for handling infinitesimals, limit processes, and motion.

Huygens was moreover able to fully employ mathematics to answer questions of physics. Often this entailed introducing a simple model for describing a complicated situation, then analyzing it starting from simple arguments to their logical consequences, developing the necessary mathematics along the way. As he wrote at the end of a draft of &quot;De vi Centrifuga&quot;:

Huygens favoured axiomatic presentations of his results, which require rigorous methods of geometric demonstration: although he allowed levels of uncertainty in the selection of primary axioms and hypotheses, the proofs of theorems derived from these could never be in doubt. Huygens&#x27;s style of publication exerted an influence in Newton&#x27;s presentation of his own major works.

Besides the application of mathematics to physics and physics to mathematics, Huygens relied on mathematics as methodology, specifically its ability to generate new knowledge about the world. Unlike Galileo, who used mathematics primarily as rhetoric or synthesis, Huygens consistently employed mathematics as a way to discover and develop theories covering various phenomena and insisted that the reduction of the physical to the geometrical satisfy exacting standards of fit between the real and the ideal. In demanding such mathematical tractability and precision, Huygens set an example for eighteenth-century scientists such as Johann Bernoulli, Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert, and Charles-Augustin de Coulomb.

Although never intended for publication, Huygens made use of algebraic expressions to represent physical entities in a handful of his manuscripts on collisions. This would make him one of the first to employ mathematical formulae to describe relationships in physics, as it is done today. Huygens also came close to the modern idea of limit while working on his &quot;Dioptrica,&quot; though he never used the notion outside geometrical optics.

==== Later influence ====
Huygens&#x27;s standing as the greatest scientist in Europe was eclipsed by Newton&#x27;s at the end of the seventeenth century, despite the fact that, as Hugh Aldersey-Williams notes, &quot;Huygens&#x27;s achievement exceeds that of Newton in some important respects&quot;. Although his journal publications anticipated the form of the modern scientific article, his persistent classicism and reluctance to publish his work did much to diminish his influence in the aftermath of the Scientific Revolution, as adherents of Leibniz’ calculus and Newton&#x27;s physics took centre stage.

Huygens&#x27;s analyses of curves that satisfy certain physical properties, such as the cycloid, led to later studies of many other such curves like the caustic, the brachistochrone, the sail curve, and the catenary. His application of mathematics to physics, such as in his studies of impact and birefringence, would inspire new developments in mathematical physics and rational mechanics in the following centuries (albeit in the new language of the calculus). Additionally, Huygens developed the oscillating timekeeping mechanisms, the pendulum and the balance spring, that have been used ever since in mechanical watches and clocks. These were the first reliable timekeepers fit for scientific use (e.g., to make accurate measurements of the inequality of the solar day, which was not possible before). His work in this area foreshadowed the union of applied mathematics with mechanical engineering in the centuries that followed.

<doc id="42132" wikidata="Q101462" url="?curid=42132" title="Rastafari">
<text>Rastafari is an Abrahamic religion that developed in Jamaica during the 1930s. It is classified as both a new religious movement and a social movement by scholars of religion. There is no central authority in control of the movement and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.

Rastafari beliefs are based on an interpretation of the Bible. Central to the religion is a monotheistic belief in a single God, referred to as Jah, who partially resides within each individual. Rastas accord key importance to Haile Selassie, Emperor of Ethiopia between 1930 and 1974, who is regarded variously as the Second Coming of Jesus, Jah incarnate, or a human prophet. Rastafari is Afrocentric and focuses attention on the African diaspora, which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or &quot;Babylon&quot;. Many Rastas call for this diaspora&#x27;s resettlement in Africa, a continent they consider the Promised Land, or &quot;Zion&quot;. Rastas refer to their practices as &quot;livity&quot;, which includes adhering to Ital dietary requirements, wearing their hair in dreadlocks, and following patriarchal gender roles. Communal meetings are known as &quot;groundations&quot;, and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the smoking of cannabis, the latter regarded as a sacrament with beneficial properties.

Rastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised Afro-Jamaican communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica&#x27;s then-dominant British colonial culture. It was influenced by both Ethiopianism and the Back-to-Africa movement promoted by black nationalist figures such as Marcus Garvey. The religion developed after several Protestant Christian clergymen, most notably Leonard Howell, proclaimed that Haile Selassie&#x27;s crowning as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari&#x27;s countercultural stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. Early Rastafari often espoused black supremacy as a form of opposition to white supremacy, but this has gradually become less common since the 1970s. In the 1960s and 1970s, it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rastafari-inspired reggae musicians, most notably Bob Marley. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley, but the movement survived and has a presence in many parts of the world.

The Rastafari movement is decentralised and organised on a largely sectarian basis. There are several denominations, or &quot;Mansions of Rastafari&quot;, the most prominent of which are the Nyahbinghi, Bobo Ashanti, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, each offering a different interpretation of Rastafari belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to one million Rastafari across the world. The largest population is in Jamaica, although small communities can be found in most of the world&#x27;s major population centres. Most Rastafari are of black African descent, and some groups accept only black members, but non-black groups have also emerged.

== Definition ==

Rastafari has been described as a religion, meeting many of the proposed definitions for what constitutes a religion, and is legally recognised as such in various countries. Some scholars of religion have labelled it an Abrahamic religion, while other scholars have also classified it as a new religious movement, a sect, a cult, and a revitalisation movement. Having arisen in Jamaica, it has been described as an Afro-Jamaican religion, and more broadly an Afro-Caribbean religion.

Although Rastafari focuses on Africa as a source of identity, it is a product of creolisation processes in the Americas, described by the Hispanic studies scholars Margarite Fernández Olmos and Lizabeth Paravisini-Gebert as &quot;a Creole religion, rooted in African, European, and Indian practices and beliefs&quot;. The scholar Ennis B. Edmonds also suggested that Rastafari was &quot;emerging&quot; as a world religion, not because of the number of its adherents, but because of its global spread. Many Rastas nevertheless reject descriptions of Rastafari as a religion, instead referring to it as a &quot;way of life&quot;, a &quot;philosophy&quot;, or a &quot;spirituality&quot;.

Emphasising its political stance, particularly in support of African nationalism and pan-Africanism, some academics have characterised Rastafari as a political movement, a &quot;politico-religious&quot; movement, or a protest movement. It has alternatively been labelled a social movement, or more specifically as a new social movement, and a cultural movement. Many Rastas or Rastafarians—as practitioners are known—nevertheless dislike the labelling of Rastafari as a &quot;movement&quot;. In 1989, a British Industrial Tribunal concluded that, for the purposes of the Race Relations Act 1976, Rastafarians could be considered an ethnic group because they have a long, shared heritage which distinguished them from other groups, their own cultural traditions, a common language, and a common religion.

Rastafari has continuously changed and developed, with significant doctrinal variation existing among practitioners depending on the group to which they belong. It is not a unified movement, and there has never been a single leader followed by all Rastafari. It is thus difficult to make broad generalisations about the movement without obscuring the complexities within it. The scholar of religion Darren J. N. Middleton suggested that it was appropriate to speak of &quot;a plethora of &quot;Rasta spiritualities&quot;&quot; rather than a single phenomenon.

The term &quot;Rastafari&quot; derives from &quot;Ras Tafari Makonnen&quot;, the pre-regnal title of Haile Selassie, the former Ethiopian emperor who occupies a central role in Rasta belief. The term &quot;Ras&quot; means a duke or prince in the Ethiopian Semitic languages; &quot;Tafari Makonnen&quot; was Selassie&#x27;s personal name. It is unknown why the early Rastas adopted this form of Haile Selassie&#x27;s name as the basis of the term for their religion. As well as being the religion&#x27;s name, &quot;Rastafari&quot; is also used for the religion&#x27;s practitioners themselves. Many commentators—including some academic sources and some practitioners—refer to the movement as &quot;Rastafarianism&quot;. However, the term is disparaged by many Rastafari, who believe that the use of &quot;-ism&quot; implies religious doctrine and institutional organisation, things they wish to avoid.

== Beliefs ==
Rastas refer to the totality of their religion&#x27;s ideas and beliefs as &quot;Rastalogy&quot;. Edmonds described Rastafari as having &quot;a fairly cohesive worldview&quot;; however, the scholar Ernest Cashmore thought that its beliefs were &quot;fluid and open to interpretation&quot;. Within the movement, attempts to summarise Rastafari belief have never been accorded the status of a catechism or creed. Rastas place great emphasis on the idea that personal experience and intuitive understanding should be used to determine the truth or validity of a particular belief or practice. No Rasta, therefore, has the authority to declare which beliefs and practices are orthodox and which are heterodox. The conviction that Rastafari has no dogma &quot;is so strong that it has itself become something of a dogma&quot;, according to the sociologist of religion Peter B. Clarke.

Some Rastas consider themselves Christian, and the religion has been deeply influenced by both Christian and Jewish thought; the scholar Michael Barnett called Rastafari &quot;an Afrocentralized blend of Christianity and Judaism&quot;. Like Christianity, Rastafari treats the Bible as a holy book occupying a central place in its belief system, with Rastas often adopting a literalist interpretation of its contents. Rastas regard the Bible as an authentic account of early black African history and of their place as God&#x27;s favoured people. They believe the Bible to be key to understanding both the past and the present and for predicting the future, while also regarding it as a source book from which they can form and explain their beliefs and practices. Rastas commonly perceive the final book of the Bible, the Book of Revelation, as the most important part, because they see its contents as having particular significance for the world&#x27;s present situation.

Contrary to scholarly understandings of how the Bible was compiled, Rastas commonly believe it was originally written on stone in the Ethiopian language of Amharic. They also believe that the Bible&#x27;s true meaning has been warped, both through mistranslation into other languages and by deliberate manipulation by those seeking to deny black Africans their history. They also regard it as cryptographic, meaning that it has many hidden meanings. They believe that its true teachings can be revealed through intuition and meditation on the &quot;book within&quot; which allows them to commune with God. Because of what they regard as the corruption of the Bible, Rastas also turn to other sources that they believe shed light on African history, including Leonard Howell&#x27;s 1935 work &quot;The Promised Key&quot;, Robert Athlyi Rogers&#x27; 1924 book &quot;Holy Piby&quot;, and Fitz Balintine Pettersburg&#x27;s 1920s work, the &quot;Royal Parchment Scroll of Black Supremacy&quot;. Many Rastas also treat the &quot;Kebra Nagast&quot;, a 14th-century Ethiopian text, as a source through which to interpret the Bible.

=== Jah and Jesus Christ===

Rastas are monotheists, worshipping a singular God whom they call Jah. The term &quot;Jah&quot; is a shortened version of &quot;Jehovah&quot;, the name of God in English translations of the Old Testament. Rastas believe in the immanence of Jah, who is inherent within each individual. This belief is reflected in the aphorism, often cited by Rastas, that &quot;God is man and man is God&quot;, and Rastas speak of &quot;knowing&quot; Jah, rather than simply &quot;believing&quot; in him. In seeking to narrow the distance between humanity and divinity, Rastafari embraces mysticism. This idea of connecting to a singular divine force within differs from the forms of spirit possession found in other African diaspora religions, such as Kumina and Convince, where external spirits are invited into the body.

Jesus is an important figure in Rastafari. However, practitioners reject the traditional Christian view of Jesus, and particularly the depiction of him as a white European. They believe Jesus was a black African, and that the white Jesus was a false god. Many Rastas regard Christianity as the creation of the white man; they treat it with suspicion out of the view that the oppressors (white Europeans) and the oppressed (black Africans) cannot share the same God. Some Rastas take the view that the God worshipped by most white Christians is actually the Devil, and a recurring claim among Rastas is that the Pope is Satan or the Antichrist. Rastas therefore often view Christian preachers as deceivers and regard Christianity as being guilty of furthering the oppression of the African diaspora, frequently referring to it as having perpetrated &quot;mental enslavement&quot;.

=== Haile Selassie ===

From its origins, Rastafari was intrinsically linked with Haile Selassie, the Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974. He remains the central figure in Rastafari ideology, and although all Rastas hold him in esteem, precise interpretations of his identity differ. Understandings of how Haile Selassie relates to Jesus vary among Rastas. Many, although not all, believe that the Ethiopian monarch was the Second Coming of Jesus, legitimising this by reference to their interpretation of the nineteenth chapter of the Book of Revelation. By viewing Haile Selassie as Jesus, these Rastas also regard him as the messiah prophesied in the Old Testament, the manifestation of God in human form, and &quot;the living God&quot;. Some perceive him as part of a Trinity, alongside God as Creator and the Holy Spirit, the latter referred to as &quot;the Breath within the temple&quot;. Rastas who view Haile Selassie as Jesus argue that both were descendants from the royal line of the Biblical king David, while Rastas also emphasise the fact that the Makonnen dynasty, of which Haile Selassie was a member, claimed descent from the Biblical figures Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.

Other Rastas see Selassie as embodying Jesus&#x27; teachings and essence but reject the idea that he was the literal reincarnation of Jesus. Members of the Twelve Tribes of Israel denomination, for instance, reject the idea that Selassie was the Second Coming, arguing that this event has yet to occur. From this perspective, Selassie is perceived as a messenger or emissary of God rather than a manifestation of God himself. Rastas holding to this view sometimes regard the deification of Haile Selassie as naïve or ignorant, in some cases thinking it as dangerous to worship a human being as God. There are various Rastas who went from believing that Haile Selassie was both God incarnate and the Second Coming of Jesus to seeing him as something distinct.

On being crowned, Haile Selassie was given the title of &quot;King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah&quot;. Rastas use this title for Haile Selassie alongside others, such as &quot;Almighty God&quot;, &quot;Judge and Avenger&quot;, &quot;King Alpha and Queen Omega&quot;, &quot;Returned Messiah&quot;, &quot;Elect of God&quot;, and &quot;Elect of Himself&quot;. Rastas also view Haile Selassie as a symbol of their positive affirmation of Africa as a source of spiritual and cultural heritage.

While he was emperor, many Jamaican Rastas professed the belief that Haile Selassie would never die. The 1974 overthrow of Haile Selassie by the military Derg and his subsequent death in 1975 resulted in a crisis of faith for many practitioners. Some left the movement altogether. Others remained, and developed new strategies for dealing with the news. Some Rastas believed that Selassie did not really die and that claims to the contrary were Western misinformation. To bolster their argument, they pointed to the fact that no corpse had been produced; in reality, Haile Selassie&#x27;s body had been buried beneath his palace, remaining undiscovered there until 1992. Another perspective within Rastafari acknowledged that Haile Selassie&#x27;s body had perished, but claimed that his inner essence survived as a spiritual force. A third response within the Rastafari community was that Selassie&#x27;s death was inconsequential as he had only been a &quot;personification&quot; of Jah rather than Jah himself.

During his life, Selassie described himself as a devout Christian. In a 1967 interview, Selassie was asked about the Rasta belief that he was the Second Coming of Jesus, to which he responded: &quot;I have heard of this idea. I also met certain Rastafarians. I told them clearly that I am a man, that I am mortal, and that I will be replaced by the oncoming generation, and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity.&quot; His grandson Ermias Sahle Selassie has said that there is &quot;no doubt that Haile Selassie did not encourage the Rastafari movement&quot;. Critics of Rastafari have used this as evidence that Rasta theological beliefs are incorrect, although some Rastas take Selassie&#x27;s denials as evidence that he was indeed the incarnation of God, based on their reading of the Gospel of Luke.

=== Afrocentrism and race===


According to Clarke, Rastafari is &quot;concerned above all else with black consciousness, with rediscovering the identity, personal and racial, of black people&quot;. The movement began among Afro-Jamaicans who wanted to reject the British colonial culture that dominated Jamaica and replace it with a new identity based on a reclamation of their African heritage. Accordingly it decenters Europe and whiteness and emphasises Africa and blackness, seeking to purge from its followers any belief in the inferiority of black people and the superiority of white people. Rastafari is therefore Afrocentric, equating blackness with the African continent, and endorsing Pan-Africanism.

Practitioners of Rastafari identify themselves with the ancient Israelites—God&#x27;s chosen people in the Old Testament—and believe that black Africans broadly or Rastas more specifically are either the descendants or the reincarnations of this ancient people. This is similar to beliefs in Judaism, although many Rastas believe that contemporary Jews&#x27; status as the descendants of the ancient Israelites is a false claim. Rastas typically believe that black Africans are God&#x27;s chosen people, meaning that they made a covenant with him and thus have a special responsibility. Rastafari espouses the view that this, the true identity of black Africans, has been lost and needs to be reclaimed.

There is no uniform Rasta view on race. Black supremacy was a theme early in the movement, with the belief in a distinctly black African race that was superior to other racial groups. This has opened the religion to accusations of racism. While some Rastas still hold such beliefs, black supremacy has waned in the movement since at least the 1970s, and non-black Rastas are now widely accepted. Some Rastas cite a 1963 speech by Haile Selassie in support of racial acceptance. Some sects maintains that white Europeans can never be legitimate Rastas but others believe an &quot;African&quot; identity is not inherently linked to black skin but whether an individual displays an African &quot;attitude&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot;.

=== Exile in Babylon ===

Rastafari teaches that the black African diaspora are exiles living in &quot;Babylon&quot;, a term which it applies to Western society. For Rastas, European colonialism and global capitalism are regarded as manifestations of Babylon, while police and soldiers are viewed as its agents. The term &quot;Babylon&quot; is adopted because of its Biblical associations. In the Old Testament, Babylon is the Mesopotamian city where the Israelites were held captive, exiled from their homeland, between 597 and 538 BCE; Rastas compare the exile of the Israelites in Mesopotamia to the exile of the African diaspora outside Africa. Rastas perceive the exile of the black African diaspora in Babylon as an experience of great suffering, with the term &quot;suffering&quot; having a significant place in Rasta discourse.

Rastas view Babylon as being responsible for both the Atlantic slave trade, which removed enslaved Africans from their continent, and ongoing poverty in the African diaspora. Rastas believe Biblical scripture explains the Atlantic slave trade, and that the enslavement, exile, and exploitation of black Africans was punishment for failing to live up to their status as Jah&#x27;s chosen people. Many Rastas, adopting a Pan-Africanist ethos, have criticised the division of Africa into nation-states, regarding this as a Babylonian development, and are often hostile to capitalist resource extraction from the continent. Rastas seek to delegitimise and destroy Babylon, something often conveyed in the Rasta aphorism &quot;Chant down Babylon&quot;. Rastas often expect the white-dominated society to dismiss their beliefs as false, and when this happens they see it as confirmation of the correctness of their faith.

=== Return to Zion ===

Rastas view Zion as an ideal to which they aspire. As with &quot;Babylon&quot;, this term comes from the Bible, where it refers to an idealised Jerusalem. Rastas use &quot;Zion&quot; either for Ethiopia specifically or for Africa more broadly. Many Rastas use the term &quot;Ethiopia&quot; as a synonym for Africa, following its usage in English translations of the Bible. Rastas in Ghana, for instance, describe themselves as already living within &quot;Ethiopia&quot;. Other Rastas apply the term &quot;Zion&quot; to Jamaica or they use it to describe a state of mind. Rastas believe that Africa, as the Promised Land, will allow them to escape the domination and degradation they experience in Babylon.

During the first three decades of the Rastafari movement, it placed strong emphasis on the need for the African diaspora to be repatriated to Africa. To this end, various Rastas lobbied the Jamaican government and United Nations to oversee this resettlement process. Other Rastas organised their own transportation to the African continent. Critics of the movement have argued that the migration of the entire African diaspora to Africa is implausible, particularly as no African country would welcome this.

By the movement&#x27;s fourth decade, the desire for physical repatriation to Africa had declined among Rastas, a change influenced by observation of the 1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia. Rather, many Rastas saw the idea of returning to Africa in a metaphorical sense, entailing the restoration of their pride and self-confidence as people of black African descent. The term &quot;liberation before repatriation&quot; began to be used within the movement. Some Rastas seek to transform Western society so that they may more comfortably live within it rather than seeking to move to Africa. There are nevertheless many Rastas who continue to emphasise the need for physical resettlement of the African diaspora in Africa.

=== Salvation and paradise ===

Rastafari is a millenarian movement, espousing the idea that the present age will come to an apocalyptic end. Many practitioners believe that on this Day of Judgment, Babylon will be overthrown, with Rastas being the chosen few who survive the upheaval. With Babylon destroyed, Rastas believe that humanity will enter a &quot;new age&quot;, a millennium of peace, justice, and happiness in which the righteous shall live in Africa. In the 1980s, many Rastas believed that the Day of Judgment would happen around the year 2000. A view then common in the Rasta community was that the world&#x27;s white people would wipe themselves out through nuclear war, with black Africans then ruling the world, something that they argued was prophesied in the Book of Daniel.

==== Death and reincarnation ====

Rasta views on death vary. Traditionally, many Rastas believed in the possibility of eternal life. In the 1980s, scholar of religion Leonard E. Barrett observed Jamaican Rastas who believed that practitioners who died had not been faithful to Jah. He suggested that this attitude stemmed from the large numbers of young people in the movement, who had thus seen very few Rastas die. Another common Rasta view is that those who are righteous may undergo reincarnation.

Rastas have traditionally avoided death and funerals, meaning that many were given Christian funerals by their relatives. This attitude to death is less common among more recent or moderate strands of Rastafari, with many considering death a natural part of life. Unlike other African diaspora religions, Rastas typically avoid ancestor veneration.

=== Morality, ethics, and gender roles ===
Most Rastas share a pair of fundamental moral principles known as the &quot;two great commandments&quot;: love of God and love of neighbour. Many Rastas believe that to determine whether they should undertake a certain act or not, they should consult the presence of Jah within themselves.

Rastafari emphasises the idea of &quot;living naturally&quot;. As an extension of this view, Africa is considered the natural abode of black Africans—a continent where they can live according to African culture and tradition, and be themselves on a physical, emotional, and intellectual level. Practitioners believe that Westerners and Babylon have detached themselves from nature through technological development and thus have become debilitated, slothful, and decadent. Some Rastas also believe they should adhere to African laws rather than the laws of Babylon, potentially putting them at odds with the law of the countries in which they currently live. In emphasising this Afrocentric approach, Rastafari expresses overtones of black nationalism.

The scholar Maureen Warner-Lewis observed that Rastafari combined a &quot;radical, even revolutionary&quot; stance on socio-political issues, particularly regarding race, with a &quot;profoundly traditional&quot; approach on other issues. Rastas typically look critically upon modern capitalism, instead favouring small-scale, pre-industrial and agricultural societies. Some Rastas have promoted activism for socio-political reform, while others believe in awaiting change that will be brought about through divine intervention. In Jamaica, Rastas typically do not vote, dismissing politics as &quot;politricks&quot;, and rarely involve themselves in political parties or unions. The Rasta tendency to believe that socio-political change is inevitable opens the religion up to the criticism from the political left that it discourages attempts to alter the status quo. Other Rastas do engage in political activism; the Ghanaian Rasta singer-songwriter Rocky Dawuni for instance was involved in campaigns promoting democratic elections, while in Grenada, many Rastas joined the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Government formed in 1979.

==== Gender roles ====

Rasta discourse has traditionally presented women as morally weak, susceptible to deception by evil, and impure while menstruating, citing the Book of Leviticus and the writings of Paul the Apostle. By contrast, Rastafari often espouses the belief that black men in the African diaspora have been emasculated by Babylon and that their manhood must therefore be restored. As a result, Rastafari often affirms patriarchal principles, including the idea that women should submit to male leadership. External observers—including scholars such as Cashmore and Edmonds—have claimed that Rastafari accords women an inferior position to men. Cashmore suggests Rastafari women accept this subordinate position and regard it as their duty to obey their men. The academic Maureen Rowe suggested that women were willing to join the religion despite its restrictions because they valued the life of structure and discipline it provided. Attitudes to women within Rastafari have changed since the 1970s, however, with a growing &quot;womanist&quot; movement, and increasing numbers of women in leadership positions at local and international levels.

Rasta women usually wear clothing that covers their head and hides their body contours. Trousers are usually avoided, with long skirts preferred. Women are expected to cover their head while praying, and in some Rasta groups this is expected of them whenever in public. According to traditional Rasta discourse, this dress code is necessary to prevent the sexual objectification of women by men in Babylon. Rasta men do not usually have such a dress code. Some Rasta women have challenged gender norms by wearing their hair uncovered in public and donning trousers.

Although men and women took part alongside each other in early Rasta rituals, from the late 1940s and 1950s the Rasta community increasingly encouraged gender segregation for ceremonies. This was based on the belief that women&#x27;s menstruation made them impure and that their presence at the ceremonies would distract male participants.

====Sexuality====

As it existed in Jamaica, Rastafari did not promote monogamy. Though it is not especially common, Rasta men are permitted to engage in polygamy, while women are expected to reserve their sexual activity for one male partner. Common-law marriage is the norm, although many Rastas are legally married. Rasta men refer to their female partners as &quot;queens&quot;, &quot;empresses&quot;, or &quot;lionesses&quot;, while the males in these relationships are known as &quot;kingmen&quot;. 
Rastafari places great importance on family life and the raising of children, with reproduction being encouraged. Traditionally, the religion emphasised the place of men in child-rearing, associating this with the recovery of African manhood. Women would often work, sometimes while the man raised the children at home.

Rastafari regards procreation as the purpose of sex, and thus oral and anal sex are usually forbidden. Both contraception and abortion are usually censured, and a common claim in Rasta discourse is that these were inventions of Babylon to decrease the black African birth-rate. 
Rastas typically express hostile attitudes to homosexuality, regarding homosexuals as evil and unnatural; this attitude derives from references to same-sex sexual activity in the Bible. Cashmore reported that Rastas typically saw the growing acceptance of birth control and homosexuality in the 1970s and 1980s as evidence of the degeneration of Babylon and proof of its approaching demise. LGBTQ+ Rastas may conceal their sexual orientation because of these attitudes.

== Practices ==
Rastas refer to their cultural and religious practices as &quot;livity&quot;. Rastafari does not place emphasis on hierarchical structures. It has no professional priesthood, with Rastas believing that there is no need for a priest to act as mediator between the worshipper and Jah. It nevertheless has &quot;elders&quot;, an honorific title bestowed upon those with a good reputation among the community. Although respected figures, they do not necessarily have administrative functions or responsibilities. When they do oversee ritual meetings, they are often responsible for helping to interpret current events in terms of Biblical scripture. Elders often communicate with each other through a network to plan movement events and form strategies.

=== Grounding ===
The term &quot;grounding&quot; is used among Rastas to refer to the establishment of relationships between like-minded practitioners. Groundings often take place in a commune or yard, and are presided over by an elder. The elder is charged with keeping discipline and can ban individuals from attending. The number of participants can range from a handful to several hundred. Activities that take place at groundings include the playing of drums, chanting, the singing of hymns, and the recitation of poetry. Cannabis, known as ganja, is often smoked. Most groundings contain only men, although some Rasta women have established their own all-female grounding circles.

One of the central activities at groundings is &quot;reasoning&quot;. This is a discussion among assembled Rastas about the religion&#x27;s principles and their relevance to current events. These discussions are supposed to be non-combative, although attendees can point out the fallacies in any arguments presented. Those assembled inform each other about the revelations that they have received through meditation and dream. Each contributor is supposed to push the boundaries of understanding until the entire group has gained greater insight into the topic under discussion. In meeting together with like-minded individuals, reasoning helps Rastas to reassure one another of the correctness of their beliefs. Rastafari meetings are opened and closed with prayers. These involve supplication of Jah, the supplication for the hungry, sick, and infants, and calls for the destruction of the Rastas&#x27; enemies, and then close with statements of adoration.

The largest groundings were known as &quot;groundations&quot; or &quot;grounations&quot; in the 1950s, although they were subsequently re-termed &quot;Nyabinghi Issemblies&quot;. The term &quot;Nyabinghi&quot; is adopted from the name of a mythical African queen. Nyabinghi Issemblies are often held on dates associated with Ethiopia and Haile Selassie. These include Ethiopian Christmas (7 January), the day on which Haile Selassie visited Jamaica (21 April), Selassie&#x27;s birthday (23 July), Ethiopian New Year (11 September), and Selassie&#x27;s coronation day (2 November). Some Rastas also organise Nyabinghi Issemblies to mark Jamaica&#x27;s Emancipation Day (1 August) and Marcus Garvey&#x27;s birthday (17 August).

Nyabinghi Issemblies typically take place in rural areas, being situated in the open air or in temporary structures—known as &quot;temples&quot; or &quot;tabernacles&quot;—specifically constructed for the purpose. Any elder seeking to sponsor a Nyabinghi Issembly must have approval from other elders and requires the adequate resources to organise such an event. The assembly usually lasts between three and seven days. During the daytime, attendees engage in food preparation, ganja smoking, and reasoning, while at night they focus on drumming and dancing around bonfires. Nyabinghi Issemblies often attract Rastas from a wide area, including from different countries. They establish and maintain a sense of solidarity among the Rasta community and cultivate a feeling of collective belonging. Unlike in many other religions, rites of passage play no role in Rastafari; on death, various Rastas have been given Christian funerals by their relatives, as there are no established Rasta funeral rites.

=== Use of cannabis ===

The principal ritual of Rastafari is the smoking of ganja, also known as marijuana or cannabis. Among the names that Rastas give to the plant are &quot;callie&quot;, &quot;Iley&quot;, &quot;the herb&quot;, &quot;the holy herb&quot;, &quot;the grass&quot;, and &quot;the weed&quot;. Cannabis is usually smoked during groundings, although some practitioners also smoke it informally in other contexts. Some Rastas smoke cannabis very frequently, something other practitioners regard as excessive. Many practitioners alternatively consume cannabis in a tea, as a spice in cooking, and as an ingredient in medicine. Not all Rastas use cannabis; many abstainers explain that they have already achieved a higher level of consciousness and thus do not require it.

In Rastafari, cannabis is considered a sacrament. Rastas argue that the use of ganja is promoted in the Bible, specifically in Genesis, Psalms, and Revelation. They regard it as having healing properties, eulogise it for inducing feelings of &quot;peace and love&quot;, and claim that it cultivates a form of personal introspection that allows the smokers to discover their inner divinity. Some Rastas believe that cannabis smoke serves as an incense that counteracts immoral practices in society.

Rastas typically smoke cannabis in the form of a large, hand-rolled cigarette known as a spliff. This is often rolled together while a prayer is offered to Jah; the spliff is lit and smoked only when the prayer is completed. At other times, cannabis is smoked in a water pipe referred to as a chalice: styles include kutchies, chillums, and steamers. The pipe is passed in a counter-clockwise direction around the assembled circle of Rastas.

There are various options that might explain how cannabis smoking came to be part of Rastafari. By the 8th century, Arab traders had introduced cannabis to Central and Southern Africa. In the 19th century, enslaved Bakongo people arrived in Jamaica, where they established the religion of Kumina. In Kumina, cannabis was smoked during religious ceremonies in the belief that it facilitated possession by ancestral spirits. The religion was largely practiced in south-east Jamaica&#x27;s Saint Thomas Parish, where a prominent early Rasta, Leonard Howell, lived while he was developing many of Rastafari&#x27;s beliefs and practices; it may have been through Kumina that cannabis became part of Rastafari. A second possible source was the use of cannabis in Hindu rituals. Hindu migrants arrived in Jamaica as indentured servants from British India between 1834 and 1917, and brought cannabis with them. A Jamaican Hindu priest, Laloo, was one of Howell&#x27;s spiritual advisors, and may have influenced his adoption of ganja. The adoption of cannabis may also have been influenced by the widespread medicinal and recreational use of cannabis among Afro-Jamaicans in the early 20th century. Early Rastafarians may have taken an element of Jamaican culture which they associated with their peasant past and the rejection of capitalism and sanctified it by according it Biblical correlates.

In many countries—including Jamaica—cannabis is illegal and by using it, Rastas protest the rules and regulations of Babylon. In the United States, for example, thousands of practitioners have been arrested because of their possession of the drug. Rastas have also advocated for the legalisation of cannabis in those jurisdictions where it is illegal; in 2015, Jamaica decriminalized personal possession of marijuana up to two ounces and legalized it for medicinal and scientific purposes. In 2019, Barbados legalised Rastafari use of cannabis within religious settings and pledged of land for Rastafari to grow it.

=== Music ===

Rastafari music developed at reasoning sessions, where drumming, chanting, and dancing are all present. Rasta music is performed to praise and commune with Jah, and to reaffirm the rejection of Babylon. Rastas believe that their music has healing properties, with the ability to cure colds, fevers, and headaches. Many of these songs are sung to the tune of older Christian hymns, but others are original Rasta creations.

The bass-line of Rasta music is provided by the akete, a three-drum set, which is accompanied by percussion instruments like rattles and tambourines. A syncopated rhythm is then provided by the fundeh drum. In addition, a batá drum improvises over the rhythm. The different components of the music are regarded as displaying different symbolism; the bassline symbolises blows against Babylon, while the lighter beats denote hope for the future.

As Rastafari developed, popular music became its chief communicative medium. During the 1960s, ska was a popular musical style in Jamaica, and although its protests against social and political conditions were mild, it gave early expression to Rasta socio-political ideology. Particularly prominent in the connection between Rastafari and ska were the musicians Count Ossie and Don Drummond. Ossie was a drummer who believed that black people needed to develop their own style of music; he was heavily influenced by Burru, an Afro-Jamaican drumming style. Ossie subsequently popularised this new Rastafari ritual music by playing at various groundings and groundations around Jamaica, with songs like &quot;Another Moses&quot; and &quot;Babylon Gone&quot; reflecting Rasta influence. Rasta themes also appeared in Drummond&#x27;s work, with songs such as &quot;Reincarnation&quot; and &quot;Tribute to Marcus Garvey&quot;.

1968 saw the development of reggae in Jamaica, a musical style typified by slower, heavier rhythms than ska and the increased use of Jamaican Patois. Like calypso, reggae was a medium for social commentary, although it demonstrated a wider use of radical political and Rasta themes than were previously present in Jamaican popular music. Reggae artists incorporated Rasta ritual rhythms, and also adopted Rasta chants, language, motifs, and social critiques. Songs like The Wailers&#x27; &quot;African Herbsman&quot; and Peter Tosh&#x27;s &quot;Legalize It&quot; referenced cannabis use, while tracks like The Melodians&#x27; &quot;Rivers of Babylon&quot; and Junior Byles&#x27; &quot;Beat Down Babylon&quot; referenced Rasta beliefs in Babylon. Reggae gained widespread international popularity during the mid-1970s, coming to be viewed by black people in many different countries as music of the oppressed. Many Rastas grew critical of reggae, believing that it had commercialised their religion. Although reggae contains much Rastafari symbolism, and the two are widely associated, the connection is often exaggerated by non-Rastas. Most Rastas do not listen to reggae music, and reggae has also been utilised by other religious groups, such as Protestant Evangelicals. Out of reggae came dub music; dub artists often employ Rastafari terminology, even when not Rastas themselves.

=== Language and symbolism ===
Rastas typically regard words as having an intrinsic power, seeking to avoid language that contributes to servility, self-degradation, and the objectification of the person. Practitioners therefore often use their own form of language, known commonly as &quot;dread talk&quot;, &quot;Iyaric&quot;, and &quot;Rasta talk&quot;. Developed in Jamaica during the 1940s, this use of language fosters group identity and cultivates particular values. Adherents believe that by formulating their own language they are launching an ideological attack on the integrity of the English language, which they view as a tool of Babylon. The use of this language helps Rastas distinguish and separate themselves from non-Rastas, for whom—according to Barrett—Rasta rhetoric can be &quot;meaningless babbling&quot;. However, Rasta terms have also filtered into wider Jamaican speech patterns.
Rastas make wide use of the pronoun &quot;I&quot;. This denotes the Rasta view that the self is divine, and reminds each Rasta that they are not a slave and have value, worth, and dignity as a human being. For instance, Rastas use &quot;I&quot; in place of &quot;me&quot;, &quot;I and I&quot; in place of &quot;we&quot;, &quot;I-ceive&quot; in place of &quot;receive&quot;, &quot;I-sire&quot; in place of &quot;desire&quot;, &quot;I-rate&quot; in place of &quot;create&quot;, and &quot;I-men&quot; in place of &quot;Amen&quot;. Rastas refer to this process as &quot;InI Consciousness&quot; or &quot;Isciousness&quot;. Rastas typically refer to Haile Selassie as &quot;Haile Selassie I&quot;, thus indicating their belief in his divinity. Rastas also typically believe that the phonetics of a word should be linked to its meaning. For instance, Rastas often use the word &quot;downpression&quot; in place of &quot;oppression&quot; because oppression bears &quot;down&quot; on people rather than lifting them &quot;up&quot;, with &quot;up&quot; being phonetically akin to &quot;opp-&quot;. Similarly, they often favour &quot;livicate&quot; over &quot;dedicate&quot; because &quot;ded-&quot; is phonetically akin to the word &quot;dead&quot;. In the early decades of the religion&#x27;s development, Rastas often said &quot;Peace and Love&quot; as a greeting, although the use of this declined as Rastafari matured.

Rastas often make use of the colours red, black, green, and gold. Red, gold, and green were used in the Ethiopian flag, while, prior to the development of Rastafari, the Jamaican black nationalist activist Marcus Garvey had used red, green, and black as the colours for the Pan-African flag representing his United Negro Improvement Association. According to Garvey, the red symbolised the blood of martyrs, the black symbolised the skin of Africans, and the green represented the vegetation of the land, an interpretation endorsed by some Rastas. The colour gold is often included alongside Garvey&#x27;s three colours; it has been adopted from the Jamaican flag, and is often interpreted as symbolising the minerals and raw materials which constitute Africa&#x27;s wealth. Rastas often paint these colours onto their buildings, vehicles, kiosks, and other items, or display them on their clothing, helping to distinguish Rastas from non-Rastas and allowing adherents to recognise their co-religionists. As well as being used by Rastas, the colour set has also been adopted by Pan-Africanists more broadly, who use it to display their identification with Afrocentricity; for this reason it was adopted on the flags of many post-independence African states. Rastas often accompany the use of these three or four colours with the image of the Lion of Judah, also adopted from the Ethiopian flag and symbolizing Haile Selassie.

=== Diet ===

Rastas seek to produce food &quot;naturally&quot;, eating what they call ital, or &quot;natural&quot; food. This is often grown organically, and locally. Most Rastas adhere to the dietary laws outlined in the Book of Leviticus, and thus avoid eating pork or crustaceans. Other Rastas remain vegetarian, or vegan, a practice stemming from their interpretation of Leviticus. Many also avoid the addition of additives, including sugar and salt, to their food. Rasta dietary practices have been ridiculed by non-Rastas; in Ghana for example, where food traditionally includes a high meat content, the Rastas&#x27; emphasis on vegetable produce has led to the joke that they &quot;eat like sheep and goats&quot;. In Jamaica, Rasta practitioners have commercialised ital food, for instance by selling fruit juices prepared according to Rasta custom.

Rastafarians typically avoid food produced by non-Rastas or from unknown sources. Rasta men refuse to eat food prepared by a woman while she is menstruating, and some will avoid food prepared by a woman at any time. Rastas also generally avoid alcohol, cigarettes, and hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine, presenting these substances as unnatural and dirty and contrasting them with cannabis. Rastas also often avoid mainstream scientific medicine and will reject surgery, injections, or blood transfusions. Instead they utilise herbal medicine for healing, especially teas and poultices, with cannabis often used as an ingredient.

=== Appearance ===
Rastas use their physical appearance as a means of visually demarcating themselves from non-Rastas. Male practitioners will often grow long beards, and many Rastas prefer to wear African styles of clothing, such as dashikis, rather than styles that originated in Western countries. However, it is the formation of hair into dreadlocks that is one of the most recognisable Rasta symbols. Rastas believe that dreadlocks are promoted in the Bible, specifically in the Book of Numbers, and regard them as a symbol of strength linked to the hair of the Biblical figure of Samson. They argue that their dreadlocks mark a covenant that they have made with Jah, and reflect their commitment to the idea of &#x27;naturalness&#x27;. They also perceive the wearing of dreads as a symbolic rejection of Babylon and a refusal to conform to its norms regarding grooming aesthetics. Rastas are often critical of black people who straighten their hair, believing that it is an attempt to imitate white European hair and thus reflects alienation from a person&#x27;s African identity. Sometimes this dreadlocked hair is then shaped and styled, often inspired by a lion&#x27;s mane symbolising Haile Selassie, who is regarded as &quot;the Conquering Lion of Judah&quot;.

Rastas differ on whether they regard dreadlocks as compulsory for practicing the religion. Some Rastas do not wear their hair in dreadlocks; within the religion they are often termed &quot;cleanface&quot; Rastas, with those wearing dreadlocked hair often called &quot;locksmen&quot;. Some Rastas have also joined the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Christian organisation to which Haile Selassie belonged, and these individuals are forbidden from putting their hair in dreadlocks by the Church. In reference to Rasta hairstyles, Rastas often refer to non-Rastas as &quot;baldheads&quot;, or &quot;combsome&quot;, while those who are new to Rastafari and who have only just started to grow their hair into dreads are termed &quot;nubbies&quot;. Members of the Bobo Ashanti sect of Rastas conceal their dreadlocks within turbans, while some Rastas tuck their dreads under a rastacap or tam headdress, usually coloured green, red, black, and yellow. Dreadlocks and Rastafari-inspired clothing have also been worn for aesthetic reasons by non-Rastas. For instance, many reggae musicians who do not adhere to the Rastafari religion wear their hair in dreads.

From the beginning of the Rastafari movement in the 1930s, adherents typically grew beards and tall hair, perhaps in imitation of Haile Selassie. The wearing of hair as dreadlocks then emerged as a Rasta practice in the 1940s; there were debates within the movement as to whether dreadlocks should be worn or not, with proponents of the style becoming dominant. There are various claims as to how this practice was adopted. One claim is that it was adopted in imitation of certain African nations, such as the Maasai, Somalis, or Oromo, or that it was inspired by the hairstyles worn by some of those involved in the anti-colonialist Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya. An alternative explanation is that it was inspired by the hairstyles of the Hindu sadhus.

The wearing of dreadlocks has contributed to negative views of Rastafari among non-Rastas, many of whom regard it as wild and unattractive. Dreadlocks remain socially stigmatised in many societies; in Ghana for example, they are often associated with the homeless and mentally ill, with such associations of marginality extending onto Ghanaian Rastas. In Jamaica during the mid-20th century, teachers and police officers used to forcibly cut off the dreads of Rastas. In various countries, Rastas have since won legal battles ensuring their right to wear dreadlocks: in 2020, for instance, the High Court of Malawi ruled that all public schools must allow their students to wear dreadlocks. The decision is to be enforced before the 30th of June 2023 or schools will be in breach of the country&#x27;s constitution.

== History ==

Rastafari developed out of the legacy of the Atlantic slave trade, in which over ten million enslaved Africans were transported to the Americas between the 16th and 19th centuries. Under 700,000 of these slaves were settled in the British colony of Jamaica. The British government abolished slavery in the Caribbean island in 1834, although racial prejudice remained prevalent across Jamaican society.

=== Ethiopianism, Back to Africa, and Marcus Garvey ===
Rastafari owed much to intellectual frameworks arising in the 19th and early 20th centuries. One key influence on Rastafari was Christian Revivalism, with the Great Revival of 1860–61 drawing many Afro-Jamaicans to join churches. Increasing numbers of Pentecostal missionaries from the United States arrived in Jamaica during the early 20th century, climaxing in the 1920s.

Further contributing significantly to Rastafari&#x27;s development were Ethiopianism and the Back to Africa ethos, both traditions with 18th-century roots. In the 19th century, there were growing calls for the African diaspora located in Western Europe and the Americas to be resettled in Africa, with some of this diaspora establishing colonies in Sierra Leone and Liberia. Based in Liberia, the black Christian preacher Edward Wilmot Blyden began promoting African pride and the preservation of African tradition, customs, and institutions. Also spreading throughout Africa was Ethiopianism, a movement that accorded special status to the east African nation of Ethiopia because it was mentioned in various Biblical passages. For adherents of Ethiopianism, &quot;Ethiopia&quot; was regarded as a synonym of Africa as a whole.

Of significant influence on Rastafari was the Jamaican activist Marcus Garvey, who spent much of his adult life in the US and Britain. Garvey supported the idea of global racial separatism and called for part of the African diaspora to relocate to Africa. His ideas faced opposition from civil rights activists like W. E. B. Du Bois who supported racial integration, and as a mass movement, Garveyism declined in the Great Depression of the 1930s. A rumour later spread that in 1916, Garvey had called on his supporters to &quot;look to Africa&quot; for the crowning of a black king; this quote was never verified. However, in August 1930, Garvey&#x27;s play, &quot;Coronation of an African King&quot;, was performed in Kingston. Its plot revolved around the crowning of the fictional Prince Cudjoe of Sudan, although it anticipated the crowning of Haile Selassie later that year. Rastas hold Garvey in great esteem, with many regarding him as a prophet. Garvey knew of Rastafari, but took a largely negative view of the religion; he also became a critic of Haile Selassie, calling him &quot;a great coward&quot; who rules a &quot;country where black men are chained and flogged&quot;.

=== Haile Selassie and the early Rastas: 1930–1949 ===

Haile Selassie was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930, becoming the first sovereign monarch crowned in Sub-Saharan Africa since 1891 and first Christian one since 1889. A number of Jamaica&#x27;s Christian clergymen claimed that Selassie&#x27;s coronation was evidence that he was the black messiah that they believed was prophesied in the Book of Revelation, the Book of Daniel, and Psalms. Over the following years, several street preachers—most notably Leonard Howell, Archibald Dunkley, Robert Hinds, and Joseph Hibbert—began claiming that Haile Selassie was the returned Jesus. They first did so in Kingston, and soon the message spread throughout 1930s Jamaica, especially among poor communities who were hit particularly hard by the Great Depression. Clarke stated that &quot;to all intents and purposes this was the beginning&quot; of the Rastafari movement.

Howell was the early movement&#x27;s &quot;leading figure&quot;. He preached that black Africans were superior to white Europeans and that Afro-Jamaicans should owe their allegiance to Haile Selassie rather than to King George V. The island&#x27;s colonial authorities arrested him and charged him with sedition in 1934, resulting in a two-year imprisonment. Following his release, Howell established the Ethiopian Salvation Society and in 1939 formed a Rasta community, known as Pinnacle, in Saint Catherine Parish. Jamaica&#x27;s police feared that Howell was plotting an armed rebellion and raided Pinnacle repeatedly. Pinnacle ultimately closed in 1954 and Howell was committed to a mental hospital.

In 1936, Italy invaded and occupied Ethiopia, and Haile Selassie went into exile. The invasion brought international condemnation and led to growing sympathy for the Ethiopian cause. In 1937, Selassie created the Ethiopian World Federation, which established a branch in Jamaica later that decade. In 1941, Allied forces drove the Italians out of Ethiopia and Selassie returned to reclaim his throne. Many Rastas interpreted this as the fulfilment of a prophecy made in the Book of Revelation.

=== Growing visibility: 1950–1969 ===

Rastafari&#x27;s main appeal was among Jamaica&#x27;s lower classes. For its first thirty years, Rastafari was in a conflictual relationship with the Jamaican authorities. Jamaica&#x27;s Rastas expressed contempt for many aspects of the island&#x27;s society, viewing the government, police, bureaucracy, professional classes, and established churches as instruments of Babylon. Relations between practitioners and the police were strained, with Rastas often being arrested for cannabis possession. During the 1950s the movement grew rapidly in Jamaica and also spread to other Caribbean islands, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

In the 1940s and 1950s, a more militant brand of Rastafari emerged. The vanguard of this was the House of Youth Black Faith, a group largely based in West Kingston. Backlash against the Rastas grew after a practitioner allegedly killed a woman in 1957. In March 1958, the first Rastafarian Universal Convention was held in Back-o-Wall, Kingston. Following the event, militant Rastas unsuccessfully tried to capture the city in the name of Haile Selassie. Later that year they tried again in Spanish Town. The increasing militancy of some Rastas resulted in growing alarm; according to Cashmore, the Rastas became &quot;folk devils&quot; in Jamaican society.

In 1959, the self-declared prophet and founder of the African Reform Church, Claudius Henry, sold thousands of tickets to Afro-Jamaicans, including many Rastas, for passage on a ship that he claimed would take them to Africa. The ship never arrived and Henry was charged with fraud. In 1960 he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the government. Henry&#x27;s son was accused of being part of a paramilitary cell and executed, confirming public fears about Rasta violence. One of the most prominent clashes between Rastas and law enforcement was the Coral Gardens incident of 1963, in which an initial skirmish between police and Rastas resulted in several deaths and led to a larger roundup of practitioners. Clamping down on the Rasta movement, in 1964 the island&#x27;s government implemented tougher laws surrounding cannabis use.

At the invitation of its government, Haile Selassie visited Jamaica for the first time on 21 April 1966, with thousands of Rastas assembled to meet him at the airport. Over the course of the 1960s, Jamaica&#x27;s Rasta community underwent a process of routinisation, with the late 1960s witnessing the launch of the first official Rastafarian newspaper, the Rastafarian Movement Association&#x27;s &quot;Rasta Voice&quot;. The decade also saw Rastafari develop in increasingly complex ways, as it did when some Rastas began to reinterpret the idea that salvation required a physical return to Africa, instead interpreting salvation as coming through a process of mental decolonisation that embraced African approaches to life.

Whereas its membership had previously derived predominantly from poorer sectors of society, in the 1960s Rastafari began attracting support from more privileged groups like students and professional musicians. The foremost group emphasising this approach was the Twelve Tribes of Israel, whose members came to be known as &quot;Uptown Rastas&quot;. Many Rastas came under the influence of the Guyanese black nationalist academic Walter Rodney, who lectured to their community in 1968 before publishing his thoughts as the pamphlet &quot;Groundings&quot;. Like Rodney, many Jamaican Rastas were influenced by the U.S.-based Black Power movement, and after that movement declined, Rastafari filled the vacuum it left for many black youth.

=== International spread and decline: 1970–present ===

In the mid-1970s, reggae&#x27;s international popularity exploded. The most successful reggae artist, Bob Marley, played a major role in introducing Rastafari themes to audiences across the world. Reggae&#x27;s popularity led to a growth in &quot;pseudo-Rastafarians&quot;, individuals who listened to reggae and wore Rasta clothing but did not share its belief system. Many Rastas were angered by this, believing it commercialised their religion.

Through reggae, Rasta musicians became increasingly important in Jamaica&#x27;s political life during the 1970s. To bolster his popularity with the electorate, Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley employed Rasta imagery and courted support from Marley and other reggae musicians. Manley described Rastas as a &quot;beautiful and remarkable people&quot; and carried a cane which he claimed was a gift from Haile Selassie. Following Manley&#x27;s example, Jamaican political parties increasingly employed Rasta language, symbols, and reggae references in their campaigns, while Rasta symbols became increasingly mainstream in Jamaican society. This helped to confer greater legitimacy on Rastafari, with reggae and Rasta imagery being increasingly presented as a core part of Jamaica&#x27;s cultural heritage for the growing tourist industry. In the 1980s, a Rasta, Barbara Makeda Blake Hannah, became a senator in the Jamaican Parliament.

Enthusiasm for Rastafari was likely dampened by the death of Haile Selassie in 1975 and that of Marley in 1981. During the 1980s, the number of Rastas in Jamaica declined, with Pentecostal and other Charismatic Christian groups proving more successful at attracting young recruits. Several prominent Rastas converted to Christianity, and two of those who did so—Judy Mowatt and Tommy Cowan—maintained that Marley had converted to Christianity, in the form of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, during his final days. The significance of Rastafari messages in reggae also declined with the growing popularity of dancehall, a Jamaican musical genre that typically foregrounded lyrical themes of hyper-masculinity, violence, and sexual activity rather than religious symbolism.

The mid-1990s saw a revival of Rastafari-focused reggae associated with musicians like Anthony B, Buju Banton, Luciano, Sizzla, and Capleton. From the 1990s, Jamaica also witnessed the growth of organised political activity within the Rasta community, seen for instance through campaigns for the legalisation of cannabis and the creation of political parties like the Jamaican Alliance Movement and the Imperial Ethiopian World Federation Incorporated Political Party, none of which attained more than minimal electoral support. In 1995, the Rastafari Centralization Organization was established in Jamaica as an attempt to organise the Rastafari community.

== Organisation ==

Rastafari is not a homogeneous movement and has no single administrative structure, nor any single leader. A majority of Rastas avoid centralised and hierarchical structures because they do not want to replicate the structures of Babylon and because their religion&#x27;s ultra-individualistic ethos places emphasis on inner divinity. The structure of most Rastafari groups is less like that of Christian denominations and is instead akin to the cellular structure of other African diasporic traditions like Haitian Vodou, Cuban Santería, and Jamaica&#x27;s Revival Zion. Since the 1970s, there have been attempts to unify all Rastas, namely through the establishment of the Rastafari Movement Association, which sought political mobilisation. In 1982, the first international assembly of Rastafari groups took place in Toronto, Canada. This and subsequent international conferences, assemblies, and workshops have helped to cement global networks and cultivate an international community of Rastas.

=== Mansions of Rastafari ===

Sub-divisions of Rastafari are often referred to as &quot;houses&quot; or &quot;mansions&quot;, in keeping with a passage from the Gospel of John (14:2): as translated in the King James Bible, Jesus states, &quot;In my father&#x27;s house are many mansions&quot;. The three most prominent branches are the House of Nyabinghi, the Bobo Ashanti, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, although other important groups include the Church of Haile Selassie I, Inc., and the Fulfilled Rastafari. By fragmenting into different houses without any single leader, Rastafari became more resilient amid opposition from Jamaica&#x27;s government during the early decades of the movement.

Probably the largest Rastafari group, the House of Nyabinghi is an aggregate of more traditional and militant Rastas who seek to keep the movement close to the way in which it existed during the 1940s. They stress the idea that Haile Selassie was Jah and the reincarnation of Jesus. The wearing of dreadlocks is regarded as indispensable and patriarchal gender roles are strongly emphasised. According to Cashmore, writing in 1983, they are &quot;vehemently anti-white&quot;. Nyabinghi Rastas refuse to compromise with Babylon and are often critical of reggae musicians like Marley for collaborating with the commercial music industry.

The Bobo Ashanti sect was founded in Jamaica by Emanuel Charles Edwards through the establishment of his Ethiopia Africa Black International Congress (EABIC) in 1958. The group established a commune in Bull Bay, where they were led by Edwards until his death in 1994. The group hold to a highly rigid ethos, and are influenced by Mosaic Law. Edwards advocated the idea of a new trinity, with Haile Selassie as the living God, himself as the Christ, and Garvey as the prophet. Male members are divided into two categories: the &quot;priests&quot; who conduct religious services and the &quot;prophets&quot; who take part in reasoning sessions. It places greater restrictions on women than most other forms of Rastafari; women are regarded as impure because of menstruation and childbirth and so are not permitted to cook for men. The group teaches that black Africans are God&#x27;s chosen people and are superior to white Europeans, with members often refusing to associate with white people. By the opening decades of the twenty-first century, the Bobo Ashanti have become more welcoming of outsiders, even those who are menstruating. Bobo Ashanti Rastas are recognisable by their long, flowing robes and turbans.

The Twelve Tribes of Israel group was founded in 1968 in Kingston by Vernon Carrington. He proclaimed himself the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet Gad and his followers call him &quot;Prophet Gad&quot;, &quot;Brother Gad&quot;, or &quot;Gadman&quot;. It is commonly regarded as the most liberal form of Rastafari and the closest to Christianity. Practitioners are often dubbed &quot;Christian Rastas&quot; because they believe Jesus is the only saviour; Haile Selassie is accorded importance, but is not viewed as the second coming of Jesus. The group divides its members into twelve groups according to which Hebrew calendar month they were born in; each month is associated with a particular colour, body part, and mental function. Maintaining dreadlocks and an Ital diet are considered commendable but not essential, while adherents are called upon to read a chapter of the Bible each day. Membership is open to individuals of any racial background.

The Twelve Tribes peaked in popularity during the 1970s, when it attracted artists, musicians, and many middle-class followers—Marley among them—resulting in the terms &quot;middle-class Rastas&quot; and &quot;uptown Rastas&quot; being applied to members of the group. Carrington died in 2005, since which time the Twelve Tribes of Israel have been led by an executive council. The council includes an equal number of men and women. As of 2010, it was recorded as being the largest of the centralised Rasta groups. It remains headquartered in Kingston, although it has followers outside Jamaica; the group was responsible for establishing the Rasta community in Shashamane, Ethiopia.

The Church of Haile Selassie, Inc., was founded by Abuna Foxe and operated much like a mainstream Christian church, with a hierarchy of functionaries, weekly services, and Sunday schools. In adopting this broad approach, the Church seeks to develop Rastafari&#x27;s respectability in wider society. Fulfilled Rastafari is a multi-ethnic movement that has spread in popularity during the 21st century, in large part through the Internet. The Fulfilled Rastafari group accept Haile Selassie&#x27;s statements that he was a man and that he was a devout Christian, and so place emphasis on worshipping Jesus through the example set forth by Haile Selassie. The wearing of dreadlocks and the adherence to an ital diet are considered issues up to the individual.

== Demographics ==

As of 2012, there were an estimated 700,000 to 1,000,000 Rastas worldwide. They can be found in many different regions, including most of the world&#x27;s major population centres. Rastafari&#x27;s influence on wider society has been more substantial than its numerical size, particularly in fostering a racial, political, and cultural consciousness among the African diaspora and Africans themselves. Men dominate Rastafari. In its early years, most of its followers were men, and the women who did adhere to it tended to remain in the background. This picture of Rastafari&#x27;s demographics has been confirmed by ethnographic studies conducted in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

The Rasta message resonates with many people who feel marginalised and alienated by the values and institutions of their society. Internationally, it has proved most popular among the poor and among marginalised youth. In valorising Africa and blackness, Rastafari provides a positive identity for youth in the African diaspora by allowing them to psychologically reject their social stigmatisation. It then provides these disaffected people with the discursive stance from which they can challenge capitalism and consumerism, providing them with symbols of resistance and defiance. Cashmore expressed the view that &quot;whenever there are black people who sense an injust disparity between their own material conditions and those of the whites who surround them and tend to control major social institutions, the Rasta messages have relevance.&quot;

=== Conversion and deconversion ===

Rastafari is a non-missionary religion. However, elders from Jamaica often go &quot;trodding&quot; to instruct new converts in the fundamentals of the religion. On researching English Rastas during the 1970s, Cashmore noted that they had not converted instantaneously, but rather had undergone &quot;a process of drift&quot; through which they gradually adopted Rasta beliefs and practices, resulting in their ultimate acceptance of Haile Selassie&#x27;s central importance. Based on his research in West Africa, Neil J. Savishinsky found that many of those who converted to Rastafari came to the religion through their pre-existing use of marijuana as a recreational drug.

Rastas often claim that—rather than converting to the religion—they were actually always a Rasta and that their embrace of its beliefs was merely the realisation of this. There is no formal ritual carried out to mark an individual&#x27;s entry into the Rastafari movement, although once they do join an individual often changes their name, with many including the prefix &quot;Ras&quot;. Rastas regard themselves as an exclusive and elite community, membership of which is restricted to those who have the &quot;insight&quot; to recognise Haile Selassie&#x27;s importance. Practitioners thus often regard themselves as the &quot;enlightened ones&quot; who have &quot;seen the light&quot;. Many of them see no point in establishing good relations with non-Rastas, believing that the latter will never accept Rastafari doctrine as truth.

Some Rastas have left the religion. Clarke noted that among British Rastas, some returned to Pentecostalism and other forms of Christianity, while others embraced Islam or no religion. Some English ex-Rastas described disillusionment when the societal transformation promised by Rastafari failed to appear, while others felt that while Rastafari would be appropriate for agrarian communities in Africa and the Caribbean, it was not suited to industrialised British society. Others experienced disillusionment after developing the view that Haile Selassie had been an oppressive leader of the Ethiopian people. Cashmore found that some British Rastas who had more militant views left the religion after finding its focus on reasoning and music insufficient for the struggle against white domination and racism.

=== Regional spread ===

Although it remains most concentrated in the Caribbean, Rastafari has spread to many areas of the world and adapted into many localised variants. It has spread primarily in Anglophone regions and countries, largely because reggae music has primarily been produced in the English language. It is thus most commonly found in the Anglophone Caribbean, United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and Anglophone parts of Africa.

==== Jamaica and the Americas ====
Barrett described Rastafari as &quot;the largest, most identifiable, indigenous movement in Jamaica.&quot; In the mid-1980s, there were approximately 70,000 members and sympathisers of Rastafari in Jamaica. The majority were male, working-class, former Christians aged between 18 and 40. In the 2011 Jamaican census, 29,026 individuals identified as Rastas. Jamaica&#x27;s Rastas were initially entirely from the Afro-Jamaican majority, and although Afro-Jamaicans are still the majority, Rastafari has also gained members from the island&#x27;s Chinese, Indian, Afro-Chinese, Afro-Jewish, mulatto, and white minorities. Until 1965, the vast majority were from the lower classes, although it has since attracted many middle-class members; by the 1980s, there were Jamaican Rastas working as lawyers and university professors. Jamaica is often valorised by Rastas as the fountain-head of their faith, and many Rastas living elsewhere travel to the island on pilgrimage.

Both through travel between the islands, and through reggae&#x27;s popularity, Rastafari spread across the eastern Caribbean during the 1970s. Here, its ideas complemented the anti-colonial and Afrocentric views prevalent in countries like Trinidad, Grenada, Dominica, and St Vincent. In these countries, the early Rastas often engaged in cultural and political movements to a greater extent than their Jamaican counterparts had. Various Rastas were involved in Grenada&#x27;s 1979 New Jewel Movement and were given positions in the Grenadine government until it was overthrown and replaced following the U.S. invasion of 1983. Although Fidel Castro&#x27;s Marxist–Leninist government generally discouraged foreign influences, Rastafari was introduced to Cuba alongside reggae in the 1970s. Foreign Rastas studying in Cuba during the 1990s connected with its reggae scene and helped to further ground it in Rasta beliefs. In Cuba, most Rastas have been male and from the Afro-Cuban population.

Rastafari was introduced to the United States and Canada with the migration of Jamaicans to continental North America in the 1960s and 1970s. American police were often suspicious of Rastas and regarded Rastafari as a criminal sub-culture. Rastafari also attracted converts from within several Native American communities and picked up some support from white members of the hippie subculture, which was then in decline. In Latin America, small communities of Rastas have also established in Brazil, Panama, and Nicaragua.

==== Africa ====

Some Rastas in the African diaspora have followed through with their beliefs about resettlement in Africa, with Ghana and Nigeria being particularly favoured. In West Africa, Rastafari has spread largely through the popularity of reggae, gaining a larger presence in Anglophone areas than their Francophone counterparts.

Caribbean Rastas arrived in Ghana during the 1960s, encouraged by its first post-independence president, Kwame Nkrumah, while some native Ghanaians also converted to the religion. The largest congregation of Rastas has been in southern parts of Ghana, around Accra, Tema, and the Cape Coast, although Rasta communities also exist in the Muslim-majority area of northern Ghana. Middleton suggests that Rasta migrants&#x27; dreadlocks resembled the hairstyles of the native fetish priests, which may have assisted the presentation of these Rastas as having authentic African roots in Ghanaian society. However, Alhassan has noted that prejudice against people wearing dreadlocks was present among at least some Ghanaians in 2008. Ghanaian Rastas have also complained of social ostracism and prosecution for cannabis possession, while non-Rastas in Ghana often consider them to be &quot;drop-outs&quot;, &quot;too Western&quot;, and &quot;not African enough&quot;. Conversely, Alhassan noted an increased acceptance of dreadlocks by 2017, with notable Ghanaians such as Lordina Mahama and Ursula Owusu-Ekuful wearing their hair in this style. This has reportedly coincided with increased interest in Rastafari in Ghana. Alhassan suggests Ghanaians &quot;trod the path&quot; to Rastafari to &quot;affirm their African identity&quot; and engage in Pan-African anti-colonial politics, &quot;despite adverse social consequences&quot;.

A smaller number of Rastas are found in Muslim-majority countries of West Africa, such as Gambia and Senegal. One West African group that wear dreadlocks are the Baye Faal, a Mouride sect in Senegambia, some of whose practitioners have started calling themselves &quot;Rastas&quot; in reference to their visual similarity to Rastafari. The popularity of dreadlocks and marijuana among the Baye Faal may have been spread in large part through access to Rasta-influenced reggae in the 1970s. A small community of Rastas also appeared in Burkina Faso.

In the 1960s, a Rasta settlement was established in Shashamane, Ethiopia, on land made available by Haile Selassie&#x27;s Ethiopian World Federation. The community faced many problems; 500 acres were confiscated by the Marxist government of Mengistu Haile Mariam. There were also conflicts with local Ethiopians, who largely regarded the incoming Rastas, and their Ethiopian-born children, as foreigners. The Shashamane community peaked at a population of 2,000, although subsequently declined to around 200.

By the early 1990s, a Rasta community existed in Nairobi, Kenya, whose approach to the religion was informed both by reggae and by traditional Kikuyu religion. Rastafari groups have also appeared in Zimbabwe, Malawi and in South Africa; in 2008, there were at least 12,000 Rastas in the country. At an African Union/Caribbean Diaspora conference in South Africa in 2005, a statement was released characterising Rastafari as a force for integration of Africa and the African diaspora.

==== Europe ====

During the 1950s and 1960s, Rastas were among the thousands of Caribbean migrants who settled in the United Kingdom, leading to small groups appearing in areas of London such as Brixton and Notting Hill in the 1950s. By the late 1960s, Rastafari had attracted converts from the second generation of British Caribbean people, spreading beyond London to cities like Birmingham, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, and Bristol. Its spread was aided by the gang structures that had been cultivated among black British youth by the rudeboy subculture, and gained increasing attention in the 1970s through reggae&#x27;s popularity. According to the 2001 United Kingdom Census there are about 5000 Rastafari living in England and Wales. Clarke described Rastafari as a small but &quot;extremely influential&quot; component of black British life.

Rastafari also established itself in various continental European countries, among them the Netherlands, Germany, Portugal, Ukraine, and France, gaining a particular foothold among black migrant populations but also attracting white converts. In France for instance it established a presence in two cities with substantial black populations, Paris and Bordeaux, while in the Netherlands, it attracted converts within the Surinamese migrant community.

==== Australasia and Asia ====
Rastafari attracted membership from within the Maori population of New Zealand, and the Aboriginal population of Australia. Rastafari has also established a presence in Japan, including a small rural community of Rasta musicians in Yoshino. Japanese Rastafari emerged from the 1960s counterculture and focuses on issues such as rural communities, colonialism, imperialism, capitalism and the environment. Rastafari is also established in Israel, primarily among those highlighting similarities between Judaism and Rastafari.

<text>Johann Maier von Eck (13 November 1486 – 13 February 1543), often anglicized as John Eck, was a German Catholic theologian, scholastic, prelate, and opponent of Martin Luther.

==Life==
Johann Eck was born Johann Maier at Eck (later Egg, near Memmingen, Swabia) and derived his additional surname from his birthplace, which he himself, after 1523, always modified into Eckius or Eccius, i.e. &quot;of Eck&quot;. His father, Michael Maier, was a peasant and bailiff, or &quot;Amtmann&quot;, of the village. The boy&#x27;s education was undertaken by his uncle, Martin Maier, parish priest at Rottenburg on the river Neckar.

At the age of 12 he entered the University of Heidelberg, which he left in the following year for Tübingen. After taking his master&#x27;s degree in 1501, he began the study of theology under Johann Jakob Lempp, and studied the elements of Hebrew and political economy with .

Johann Eck left Tübingen in 1501 on account of the plague and after a year at Cologne finally settled at Freiburg University, at first as a student of theology and law and later as a successful teacher where he was mentor to the prominent Anabaptist leader of Waldshut and Nikolsburg, Balthasar Hubmaier, and later retaining this relationship during their move to the University of Ingolstadt. In 1508 he entered the priesthood in Strasbourg and two years later obtained his doctorate in theology.

At Freiburg in 1506 he published his first work, &quot;Ludicra logices exercitamenta&quot;. At odds with his colleagues, he accepted a call to a theological chair at Ingolstadt in November 1510, also receiving a canon at Eichstadt. In 1512 he became prochancellor at the university and made the institution a bulwark of Catholicism. In the theological field he produced his &quot;Chrysopassus&quot; (Augsburg, 1514), in which he developed a theory of predestination, and also commented on the &quot;Summulae&quot; of Peter of Spain and on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;De caelo&quot; and &quot;De anima&quot;.

As a political economist he defended the lawfulness of putting out capital at interest, arguing his view at disputations at Augsburg (1514), Bologna (1515), and Vienna in 1516 where he also disputed about predestination. Through these successes he gained the patronage of the Fuggers.

Between 1516 and 1520, in addition to all his other duties, he published commentaries on the &quot;Summulae&quot; of Petrus Hispanus, and on the &quot;Dialectics&quot;, &quot;Physics&quot; and lesser scientific works of Aristotley. During these early years, Eck was considered a modern theologian, and his commentaries were informed by the New Learning. His aim, however, had been to find a &quot;via media&quot; between old and new.

He championed the cause of the papacy, writing &quot;De primatu Petri&quot; in 1519, and his &quot;Enchiridion locorum communium adversus Lutherum&quot; ran through 46 editions between 1525 and 1576. From 1530 to 1535 he published a collection of his writings against Luther, &quot;Opera contra Ludderum&quot;, in 4 vols. He verbally assailed his friend, humanist and jurist Ulrich Zasius, for a doctrine proclaimed ten years before, and Erasmus&#x27;s &quot;Annotationes in Novum Testamentum&quot;. Eck died at Ingolstadt on 10 February 1543.

==Disputations with Luther and Karlstadt==
As early as the spring of 1517 Eck had entered into friendly relations with Martin Luther, who had regarded him as in harmony with his own views, but this relationship was short-lived. In his &quot;Obelisci&quot;, Eck attacked Luther&#x27;s theses, which had been sent to him by Christoph von Scheurl, and accused him of promoting the &quot;heresy of the Bohemian Brethren&quot;, fostering anarchy within the Church and branded him a Hussite. Luther replied in his &quot;Asterisci adversus obeliscos Eccii&quot;, while Andreas Karlstadt defended Luther&#x27;s views of indulgences and engaged in a violent controversy with Eck.

A mutual desire for a public disputation led to a compact between Eck and Luther by which the former pledged himself to meet Karlstadt in debate at Erfurt or Leipzig, on condition that Luther abstain from all participation in the discussion. In December 1518, Eck published the twelve theses which he was prepared to uphold against Karlstadt, but since they were aimed at Luther rather than at the ostensible opponent, Luther addressed an open letter to Karlstadt, in which he declared himself ready to meet Eck in debate.

The disputation between Eck and Karlstadt began at Leipzig on 27 June 1519. In the first four sessions Eck maintained the thesis that free will is the active agent in the creation of good works, but he was compelled by his opponent to modify his position so as to concede that the grace of God and free will work in harmony toward the common end. Karlstadt then proceeded to argue that good works are to be ascribed to the agency of God alone, whereupon Eck yielded so far as to admit that free will is passive in the beginning of conversion, although he maintained that in the course of time it enters into its rights; so that while the entirety of good works originates in God, their accomplishment is not entirely the work of God.

Despite the fact that Eck was thus virtually forced to abandon his position, he succeeded in confusing Karlstadt and carried off the victory. He was less successful against Luther, who, according to Eck, was his superior in memory, acumen, and learning. After a disputation on the supremacy of the papacy, purgatory, penance, etc., lasting twenty-three days (4 July–27 July), the arbitrators declined to give a verdict. Eck did succeed in making Luther admit that there was some truth in the Hussite opinions and declare himself against the Pope, but this success only embittered his animosity against his opponents. Eck also forced Luther to declare that Ecumenical Councils were sometimes errant, as in the case when Constance (1414–1418) condemned Hus (1415). Luther effectively denied the authority of both pope and council. Eck was greeted as victor by the theologians of the University of Leipzig.

==Attacks on Luther and Melanchthon==
Soon after his return to Ingolstadt, Eck attempted to persuade Elector Frederick of Saxony to have Luther&#x27;s works burned in public, and during the year 1519 he published eight writings against the new movement. He failed, however, to obtain a condemnatory decision from the universities appointed to pronounce on the outcome of the Leipzig disputation. Erfurt returned the proceedings of the meeting to the Saxon duke without signifying its approval, while Paris, after repeated urging, gave an ambiguous decision limited to &quot;the doctrine of Luther so far as investigated&quot;.

Eck&#x27;s only followers were the aged heretic-hunter Hoogstraten and Emser of Leipzig, together with the allied authorities of the universities of Cologne and Leuven. Luther returned Eck&#x27;s assaults with more than equal vehemence and about this time Philipp Melanchthon wrote to Œcolampadius that at Leipzig he had first become distinctly aware of the difference between what he considered to be true Christian theology and the scholasticism of the Aristotelian doctors. In his &quot;Excusatio&quot; Eck retorted that Melanchthon knew nothing of theology, a claim Melanchthon responded to in his reply.

Eck fared still worse in October of the same year when he sought to aid Emser with a strongly worded tirade against Luther. Two satires, one by Œcolampadius and the other by Willibald Pirckheimer, angered Eck who pushed for the public burning of the entire literature in the market-place at Ingolstadt, an act from which he was restrained by his colleague Reuchlin.

==Papal emissary and inquisitor==
Johann Eck was more highly esteemed in Rome than in Germany, where he induced the universities of Cologne and Louvain to condemn Luther&#x27;s writings, but failed to enlist the German princes. In January 1520, he visited Italy at the invitation of Pope Leo X, to whom he presented his latest work &quot;De primate Petri adversus Ludderum&quot; (Ingolstadt, 1520) for which he was rewarded with the nomination to the office of papal protonotary, although his efforts to urge the Curia to decisive action against Luther were unsuccessful for some time.

In July he returned to Germany with the bull &quot;Exsurge Domine&quot; directed against Luther&#x27;s writings, in which forty-one propositions of Luther were condemned as heretical or erroneous. He now believed himself in a position to crush not only the &quot;Lutheran heretics&quot;, but also his humanist critics. The effect of the publication of the bull, however, made this difficult. Universities and humanists were at one in denunciation of the outrage; and, due the attitude of the people, Eck was barely able to escape from Saxony alive.

At Meissen, Brandenburg, and Merseburg, he succeeded in giving the papal measure due official publicity, but at Leipzig he was the object of the ridicule of the student body and was compelled to flee by night to Freiberg, where he was again prevented from proclaiming the bull. At Erfurt the students tore the bull down and threw it into the water, while in other places the papal decree was subjected to still greater insults.

In his anger he appealed to force, and his &quot;Epistola ad Carolum V&quot; (18 February 1521) called on the emperor to take measures against Luther, an appeal soon answered by the Edict of Worms (May 1521). In 1521 and 1522 Eck was again in Rome, reporting on the results of his nunciature. On his return from his second visit he was the prime mover in the promulgation of the Bavarian religious edict of 1522, which practically established the senate of the University of Ingolstadt as a tribunal of the Inquisition. In return for this action of the duke, who had at first been opposed to the policy of repression, Eck obtained for him, during a third visit to Rome in 1523, valuable ecclesiastical concessions. He continued unabated in his zeal against the reformers, publishing eight major works from 1522 to 1526.

Wealth and power were included in the aspirations of Eck. He appropriated the revenues of his parish of Günzburg, while he relegated its duties to a vicar. Twice he visited Rome as a diplomatic representative of the Bavarian court to obtain sanction for the establishment of a court of inquisition against the Lutheran teachings at Ingolstadt. The first of these journeys, late in the autumn of 1521, was fruitless on account of the death of Leo X, but his second journey two years later, in 1523, was successful. Eck was the prime mover in many heresy trials, including that of Leonhard Kaser, whose history was published by Luther.

==Zwingli and his followers==
In addition to his inquisitorial duties, every year witnessed the publication of one or more writings against iconoclasm and in defense of the doctrines of the Mass, purgatory, and auricular confession. His &quot;Enchiridion locorum communium adversus Lutherum et alios hostes ecclesiae&quot; (Landshut, 1525) went through forty-six editions before 1576. As its title indicates, it was directed primarily against Melanchthon&#x27;s &quot;Loci Communes&quot;, although it also concerned itself to some extent with the teachings of Huldrych Zwingli.

At Baden-in-Aargau from 21 May until 18 June 1526 a public disputation on the doctrine of transubstantiation was held, in which Eck and Thomas Murner were pitted against Johann Oecolampadius. The affair ended decidedly in favor of Eck, who induced the authorities to enter on a course of active persecution of Zwingli and his followers (Conference of Baden).

The effect of his victory at Baden was dissipated, however, at the Bern Disputation (January 1528), where the propositions advanced by the Reformers were debated in the absence of Eck, and Bern, Basel, and other places were definitely won for the Reformation. At the Diet of Augsburg (1530), Eck played the leading part among the Roman Catholic theologians.

==Peace overtures==
For the Diet of Augsburg, while still at Ingolstadt, Eck compiled what he considered to be 404 heretical propositions from the writings of the reformers as an aid to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.

At Augsburg he was charged by the Emperor to draw up, in concert with twenty other theologians, a refutation of the Lutheran Augsburg Confession, which had been delivered to the emperor on 25 June 1530, but he had to rewrite it five times before it suited the emperor. It was known as the &quot;Confutatio pontificia&quot;, embodying the Catholic reaction to the reformers. He also was involved in the fruitless negotiations with the Protestant theologians, including Philipp Melanchthon, that took place at Augsburg; Eck with Wimpina and Cochlæus met the Lutherans in August.

He was at the Colloquy of Worms in 1540 where he showed some signs of a willingness to compromise. In January 1541 he renewed these efforts and succeeded in impressing Melanchthon as being prepared to give his assent to the main principles of the reformers, e.g. justification by faith; but at the diet of Regensburg in the spring and summer of 1541, he reasserted his opposition. Afterwards Eck clashed with Martin Bucer over the latter&#x27;s published report of the diet.

==Eck&#x27;s German New Testament==
Eck produced a German translation of the Bible (the New Testament, a revision of H. Emser&#x27;s rendering) which was first published at Ingolstadt in 1537.

==Eck and the genealogy of Christ==
Eck made a sermon on the genealogy of Christ, naming Mary&#x27;s mother&#x27;s parents as Emerentia and Stollanus: &quot;The renowned Father John of Eck of Ingolstadt, in a sermon on St. Anne (published at Paris in 1579), pretends to know even the names of the parents St. Anne. He calls them Stollanus and Emerentia. He says that St. Anne was born after Stollanus and Emerentia had been childless for twenty years&quot;.

==Eck and the Jews==
In 1541 Eck published his &quot;Against the Defense of the Jews&quot; (German: &quot;Ains Juden-büechlins Verlegung&quot;). In it he opposes the position of the Nuremberg reformer Andreas Osiander, who in the pamphlet &quot;Whether It Be True and Credible That the Jews Secretly Strangulate Christian Children and Make Use of Their Blood&quot; wanted to quash medieval suspicion that Jews were responsible for killing Christian children, desecrating the eucharistic Host, and poisoning wells. Eck accused Osiander of being a &quot;Jew-protector&quot; and &quot;Jew-father&quot;, and no fewer than nineteen times reviled the Jews, and called them &quot;a blasphemous race&quot;.

<text>The Greatest Show on Earth is a 1952 American drama film produced and directed by Cecil B. DeMille, shot in Technicolor and released by Paramount Pictures. Set in the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, the film stars Betty Hutton and Cornel Wilde as trapeze artists competing for the center ring and Charlton Heston as the circus manager. James Stewart also stars as a mysterious clown who never removes his makeup, and Dorothy Lamour and Gloria Grahame also play supporting roles.

In addition to the actors, the real Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey&#x27;s Circus&#x27; 1951 troupe appears in the film with its complement of 1,400 people, hundreds of animals and 60 railroad cars of equipment and tents. The actors learned their circus roles and participated in the acts. The film&#x27;s storyline is supported by lavish production values, actual circus acts and documentary-style views into the complex logistics behind big-top circuses.

The film won two Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Story, and was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Director and Best Film Editing. It also won Golden Globe Awards for Best Cinematography, Best Director and Best Motion Picture – Drama.

==Plot==

Brad Braden is the no-nonsense general manager of the world&#x27;s largest railroad circus. The show&#x27;s board of directors plans to run a short 10-week season rather than risk losing money in a shaky postwar economy. Brad bargains to keep the circus on the road as long as it makes a profit, thus keeping the 1,400 performers and roustabouts employed.

Brad reluctantly tells Holly, his aerialist girlfriend, that she will no longer be the star. He has been forced to hire world-famous aerialist (and notorious ladies man) &quot;The Great Sebastian&quot; as the star and main attraction of that year&#x27;s show. Holly is heartbroken and claims that Brad has no feelings. Trouble is also brewing for beloved Buttons the Clown, who never appears without his makeup and seems to possess medical knowledge. Holly finds a newspaper article about a mercy killer, but does not immediately connect the doctor who killed his wife to Buttons.

Sebastian arrives and is coldly greeted by two former lovers: Angel, who performs in the elephant act with the pathologically jealous Klaus; and Phyllis, who has a dual role as an iron jaw artist and a singer in one of the musical numbers. Sebastian is attracted to Holly, and offers her the center ring. When Brad refuses to allow the change, Holly vows to make &quot;her&quot; ring the focus of attention.

Buttons&#x27; mother attends a performance, warning him the police are on his trail. Meanwhile, the competition between the two aerialists becomes increasingly dangerous. The aerial duel ends when Sebastian removes his safety net, then suffers a serious fall when a stunt goes wrong. Buttons tends to him before the ambulance comes, impressing the circus&#x27; doctor. Holly finally has the center ring and star billing, but is not happy at how she got it. Brad cannot comfort her, as she now has feelings for Sebastian.

Brad, who runs a clean show, catches crooked midway concessionaire Harry cheating the customers. Harry is fired, vows revenge, and hangs about the periphery of the show sowing disaffection, particularly with Klaus. Several months later, Sebastian rejoins the show, but his right arm is paralyzed. A guilt-ridden Holly professes her love for Sebastian, believing Brad is unfeeling. Angel berates Holly for her actions and starts a relationship with Brad herself. During one of the performances, a furious Klaus threatens to have an elephant step on Angel rather than let her go to another man. Brad intervenes to save her and fires Klaus.

After one performance, FBI Special Agent Gregory, who is hunting for the mercy killer, joins the circus train. He shows Brad a photo of Buttons without makeup, but Brad does not recognize him. Later, Buttons tells Brad that Sebastian has feeling in his injured hand, a sign that his disability is not permanent. Brad makes the connection and casually observes that Gregory will be taking fingerprints at the next stop, so Buttons can escape or lie low if he wishes.

Harry and Klaus stop the first section of the train to rob the pay wagon. Klaus sees the second section coming, and realizes that Angel is aboard that train. He turns his car&#x27;s headlights down the track to warn the oncoming train. Unable to brake in time, the second train smashes the car off the tracks, killing Klaus and Harry and collides with the first train, causing great damage and many injuries.

Brad is pinned in the wreckage, bleeding from a cut artery. Buttons tries to slip away from the wreck site, but Holly, realizing whom she truly loves, begs Buttons for help. Buttons gives Brad a direct transfusion from Sebastian, who has the same rare blood type. Gregory assists Buttons and afterwards reluctantly arrests him, telling him &quot;You&#x27;re all right.&quot; Buttons gives his dog to a child and leaves with Gregory to face an unknown fate.

Holly takes command of the show, mounting a parade that leads the whole nearby town to an open-air performance. Brad realizes how much he loves Holly, but she now has no time for him because the show must go on. Sebastian proposes marriage to Angel, and she accepts. Holly leads the performers in an improvised &quot;spec&quot; around the three rings – a magnificent recovery from the disaster that insures the circus will continue its national tour.

The film features about 85 Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus acts, including clowns Emmett Kelly and Lou Jacobs, midget Cucciola, bandmaster Merle Evans, foot juggler Miss Loni and aerialist Antoinette Concello. John Ringling North plays himself as the owner of the circus.

The film includes several unbilled cameo appearances (mostly in the circus audiences) including Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, Lamour&#x27;s costars in the &quot;Road to ...&quot; films. William Boyd appears in his usual guise of Hopalong Cassidy. Danny Thomas, Van Heflin, character actor Oliver Blake and Noel Neill are seen as circus patrons. Leon Ames is seen and heard in the train wreck sequence. A barker, kept anonymous until the film&#x27;s end, is seen in the closing moments of the film. The voice is finally revealed to be that of Edmond O&#x27;Brien.

==Production==
The film was shot in Sarasota, Florida, where locals were paid 75 cents per hour as extras.

One story concerning the movie says that Lucille Ball was offered Gloria Grahame&#x27;s role but withdrew when she discovered that she was pregnant with her first child, Lucie Arnaz. However, this account has been disputed because when DeMille was filming with Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, Ball was preparing &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; for its launch on CBS.

Art Concello, who was the general manager of Ringling Bros. at the time DeMille was traveling with the show, figured out how to execute the stunt and doubled for Cornel Wilde in the Great Sebastian&#x27;s fall scene. He had been a headlining aerialist when he was a performer.

Betty Hutton and Wilde had to learn how to fly on the trapeze for their scenes. Wilde may have faced difficulty because of his acrophobia. Hutton became quite proficient with the single bar. Film footage exists showing Hutton rehearsing in the air, talking to DeMille who had ridden to her height on a camera crane. Hutton&#x27;s stunt double was La Norma Fox, also from Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.

The music for the song &quot;Lovely Luawana Lady&quot; was written by John Ringling North, who appears briefly as himself during the discussion about whether the show would play the road rather than have a short ten-week season. North was a nephew of the five Ringling brothers who founded Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, and was its owner at the time.

==Release==
The film premiered at the Florida Theater (now the Sarasota Opera House) in Sarasota, Florida.

The film earned $12.8 million at the box office in the United States and Canada, making it the highest-grossing film of 1952, as well as Paramount&#x27;s most successful film to that time. It was also the most popular film in Britain in 1952 and the most popular film of the year in France in 1953.

The film played for 11 weeks at New York&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall, a record duration that it shared with &quot;Random Harvest&quot; in 1942 and that would last until at least the 1960s.

==Critical reception==
===Contemporary===
On the film&#x27;s release, Bosley Crowther in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; a &quot;lusty triumph of circus showmanship and movie skill&quot; and a &quot;piece of entertainment that will delight movie audiences for years&quot;:
:Sprawling across a mammoth canvas, crammed with the real-life acts and thrills, as well as the vast backstage minutiae, that make the circus the glamorous thing it is and glittering in marvelous Technicolor—truly marvelous color, we repeat—this huge motion picture of the big-top is the dandiest ever put upon the screen.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine called the film a &quot;mammoth merger of two masters of malarkey for the masses: P. T. Barnum and Cecil B. de Mille&quot; that &quot;fills the screen with pageants and parades [and] finds a spot for 60-odd circus acts,&quot; but its plot &quot;does not quite hold all this pageantry together.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film &quot;effectively serve[s] the purpose of a framework for all the atmosphere and excitement of the circus on both sides of the big canvas.&quot;

===Retrospective===
In 1977, Joe Walders wrote in &quot;TV Guide&quot; that a film&#x27;s box-office success does not necessarily translate to continued popularity on television, and cited &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; as a primary example: &quot;[It] was not only the top moneymaker of the year, but it also won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Yet it has rarely done well on television.&quot;

Critic Leonard Maltin opined that &quot;like most of DeMille&#x27;s movies, this may not be art, but it&#x27;s hugely enjoyable.&quot;

In 2005, &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide: Enjoying the Best of Hollywood&#x27;s Worst&quot; included &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 50% from 44 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; is melodramatic, short on plot, excessively lengthy and bogged down with cliches, but not without a certain innocent charm.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 76 out of 100 based on 12 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

==Accolades==
At the 25th Academy Awards, the movie was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning two (for Best Picture and Best Motion Picture Story). It was the last Best Picture winner to win fewer than three Academy Awards until &quot;Spotlight&quot; (2015).

=== Oscar controversy ===
Some reviewers consider &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; among the weakest selections for the Academy Award for Best Picture, as it defeated highly rated films such as &quot;High Noon&quot;, &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; and the unnominated &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Empire&quot; listed it as the third-worst Best Picture winner. MSNBC&#x27;s Erik Lundegaard called &quot;Crash&quot; the &quot;worst Best Picture winner since the &#x27;dull, bloated&#x27; film &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth.&quot;&quot; In 2013, the selection of &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; rather than &quot;High Noon&quot; was listed by &quot;Time&quot; among the 10 most controversial Best Picture races. &quot;Premiere&quot; placed the film on its list of the 10 worst Oscar winners. It holds the second-lowest spot on Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; 2011 list of the 90 films to win Best Picture (ahead of only 1929&#x27;s &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot;).

Stanley Kramer alleged that the film&#x27;s Best Picture Oscar was the result of the political climate in Hollywood in 1952. Senator Joseph McCarthy was pursuing communists at the time, and DeMille was a conservative Republican involved with the National Committee for a Free Europe. Another Best Picture nominee, &quot;High Noon&quot;, was produced by Carl Foreman, who would soon appear on the Hollywood blacklist, and one of the scriptwriters of &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, Marguerite Roberts, was also blacklisted.

However, it is also possible that &quot;The Greatest Show On Earth&quot; won Best Picture because it was seen as a last chance for DeMille to win a competitive Oscar. A Hollywood legend, DeMille&#x27;s best work had been done during the silent film era, before the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was established. It is possible that the members of the Academy who were veterans of the silent era felt that he, as an elder statesman of Hollywood and one of the founders of the Academy, deserved the honor even if the other nominees for Best Picture were in some ways better than &quot;The Greatest Show On Earth&quot;.

==Influence==

A television series with the same title was inspired by the film, with Jack Palance in the role of Charlton Heston&#x27;s character. The program ran on Tuesday evenings for 30 episodes on ABC during the 1963–1964 season.

The self-titled theme song later served as the theme for WGN-TV&#x27;s long-running &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus&quot;.

&quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; was the first film that director Steven Spielberg saw, and he credits it as one of the major inspirations that led him into a film career. He identifies the film&#x27;s train crash scene as a major influence, reflected in the science-fiction film &quot;Super 8&quot; (2011), which he produced. In an early scene in Spielberg&#x27;s 2005 remake of &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, the train-wreck sequence from &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; is briefly shown on a television. The opening scene of Spielberg&#x27;s 2022 semi-autobiographical film &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; dramatizes his seeing the film on the big screen, in which Sammy Fabelman (the fictional version of young Spielberg) watches it with his parents in a cinema and is mesmerized by the train-wreck sequence.

<text>A garden is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the cultivation, display, and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature. The single feature identifying even the wildest wild garden is &quot;control&quot;. The garden can incorporate both natural and artificial materials.

Gardens often have design features including statuary, follies, pergolas, trellises, stumperies, dry creek beds, and water features such as fountains, ponds (with or without fish), waterfalls or creeks. Some gardens are for ornamental purposes only, while others also produce food crops, sometimes in separate areas, or sometimes intermixed with the ornamental plants. Food-producing gardens are distinguished from farms by their smaller scale, more labor-intensive methods, and their purpose (enjoyment of a hobby or self-sustenance rather than producing for sale, as in a market garden). Flower gardens combine plants of different heights, colors, textures, and fragrances to create interest and delight the senses.

The most common form today is a residential or public garden, but the term &quot;garden&quot; has traditionally been a more general one. Zoos, which display wild animals in simulated natural habitats, were formerly called zoological gardens. Western gardens are almost universally based on plants, with &quot;garden&quot;, which etymologically implies &quot;enclosure&quot;, often signifying a shortened form of botanical garden. Some traditional types of eastern gardens, such as Zen gardens, however, use plants sparsely or not at all. Landscape gardens, on the other hand, such as the English landscape gardens first developed in the 18th century, may omit flowers altogether.

Landscape architecture is a related professional activity with landscape architects tending to engage in design at many scales and working on both public and private projects.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the word &quot;gardening&quot; refers to enclosure: it is from Middle English &quot;gardin&quot;, from Anglo-French &quot;gardin&quot;, &quot;jardin&quot;, of Germanic origin; akin to Old High German &quot;gard&quot;, &quot;gart&quot;, an enclosure or compound, as in Stuttgart. See Grad (Slavic settlement) for more complete etymology. The words &quot;yard&quot;, &quot;court&quot;, and Latin &quot;hortus&quot; (meaning &quot;garden&quot;, hence horticulture and orchard), are cognates—all referring to an enclosed space.

The term &quot;garden&quot; in British English refers to a small enclosed area of land, usually adjoining a building. This would be referred to as a yard in American English.

==Uses==

A garden can have aesthetic, functional, and recreational uses:
* Cooperation with nature
** Plant cultivation
** Garden-based learning
* Observation of nature
** Bird- and insect-watching
** Reflection on the changing seasons
* Relaxation
** Placing down different types of garden gnomes
** Family dinners on the terrace
** Children playing in the garden
** Reading and relaxing in a hammock
** Maintaining the flowerbeds
** Pottering in the shed
** Basking in warm sunshine
** Escaping oppressive sunlight and heat
* Growing useful produce
** Flowers to cut and bring inside for indoor beauty
** Fresh herbs and vegetables for cooking

==History==

=== Asia ===
==== China ====
The earliest recorded Chinese gardens were created in the valley of the Yellow River, during the Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BC). These gardens were large enclosed parks where the kings and nobles hunted game, or where fruit and vegetables were grown. Early inscriptions from this period, carved on tortoise shells, have three Chinese characters for garden, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;pu&quot; and &quot;yuan&quot;. &quot;You&quot; was a royal garden where birds and animals were kept, while &quot;pu&quot; was a garden for plants. During the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC), &quot;&quot; became the character for all gardens. The old character for &quot;yuan&quot; is a small picture of a garden; it is enclosed in a square which can represent a wall, and has symbols which can represent the plan of a structure, a small square which can represent a pond, and a symbol for a plantation or a pomegranate tree.

A famous royal garden of the late Shang dynasty was the &quot;Terrace, Pond and Park&quot; of the Spirit (&quot;Lingtai, Lingzhao Lingyou&quot;) built by King Wenwang west of his capital city, Yin. The park was described in the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; this way:

:The King makes his promenade in the Park of the Spirit,
:The deer are kneeling on the grass, feeding their fawns,
:The deer are beautiful and resplendent.
:The immaculate cranes have plumes of a brilliant white.
:The King makes his promenade to the Pond of the Spirit,
:The water is full of fish, who wriggle.

Another early royal garden was &quot;Shaqui&quot;, or the &quot;Dunes of Sand&quot;, built by the last Shang ruler, King Zhou (1075–1046 BC). It was composed of an earth terrace, or &quot;tai&quot;, which served as an observation platform in the center of a large square park. It was described in one of the early classics of Chinese literature, the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; (&quot;Shiji&quot;). According to the &quot;Shiji&quot;, one of the most famous features of this garden was the &quot;Wine Pool and Meat Forest&quot; (酒池肉林). A large pool, big enough for several small boats, was constructed on the palace grounds, with inner linings of polished oval shaped stones from the seashore. The pool was then filled with wine. A small island was constructed in the middle of the pool, where trees were planted, which had skewers of roasted meat hanging from their branches. King Zhou and his friends and concubines drifted in their boats, drinking the wine with their hands and eating the roasted meat from the trees. Later Chinese philosophers and historians cited this garden as an example of decadence and bad taste.

During the Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC), in 535 BC, the &quot;Terrace of Shanghua&quot;, with lavishly decorated palaces, was built by King Jing of the Zhou dynasty. In 505 BC, an even more elaborate garden, the &quot;Terrace of Gusu&quot;, was begun. It was located on the side of a mountain, and included a series of terraces connected by galleries, along with a lake where boats in the form of blue dragons navigated. From the highest terrace, a view extended as far as Lake Tai, the Great Lake.

==== India ====
&quot;Manasollasa&quot; is a twelfth century Sanskrit text that offers details on garden design and a variety of other subjects. Both public parks and woodland gardens are described, with about 40 types of trees recommended for the park in the &quot;Vana-krida&quot; chapter. &quot;Shilparatna&quot;, a text from the sixteenth century, states that flower gardens or public parks should be located in the northern portion of a town.

==== Japan ====
The earliest recorded Japanese gardens were the pleasure gardens of the Emperors and nobles. They were mentioned in several brief passages of the , the first chronicle of Japanese history, published in 720 CE. In spring 74 CE, the chronicle recorded: &quot;The Emperor Keikō put a few carp into a pond, and rejoiced to see them morning and evening&quot;. The following year, &quot;The Emperor launched a double-hulled boat in the pond of Ijishi at Ihare, and went aboard with his imperial concubine, and they feasted sumptuously together&quot;. In 486, the chronicle recorded that &quot;The Emperor Kenzō went into the garden and feasted at the edge of a winding stream&quot;.

==== Korea ====

Korean gardens are a type of garden described as being natural, informal, simple and unforced, seeking to merge with the natural world. They have a history that goes back more than two thousand years, but are little known in the west. The oldest records date to the Three Kingdoms period (57 BC – 668 AD) when architecture and palace gardens showed a development noted in the Korean &quot;History of the Three Kingdoms&quot;.

=== Europe ===

Gardening was not recognized as an art form in Europe until the mid 16th century when it entered the political discourse, as a symbol of the concept of the &quot;ideal republic&quot;. Evoking utopian imagery of the Garden of Eden, a time of abundance and plenty where humans didn&#x27;t know hunger or the conflicts that arose from property disputes. John Evelyn wrote in the early 17th century, &quot;there is not a more laborious life then is that of a good Gard&#x27;ners; but a labour full of tranquility and satisfaction; Natural and Instructive, and such as (if any) contributes to Piety and Contemplation.&quot; During the era of Enclosures, the agrarian collectivism of the feudal age was idealized in literary &quot;fantasies of liberating regression to garden and wilderness&quot;.

==== France ====
Following his campaign in Italy in 1495, where he saw the gardens and castles of Naples, King Charles VIII brought Italian craftsmen and garden designers, such as Pacello da Mercogliano, from Naples and ordered the construction of Italian-style gardens at his residence at the Château d&#x27;Amboise and at Château Gaillard, another private résidence in Amboise. His successor Henry II, who had also travelled to Italy and had met Leonardo da Vinci, created an Italian garden nearby at the Château de Blois. Beginning in 1528, King Francis I created new gardens at the Château de Fontainebleau, which featured fountains, parterres, a forest of pine trees brought from Provence, and the first artificial grotto in France. The Château de Chenonceau had two gardens in the new style, one created for Diane de Poitiers in 1551, and a second for Catherine de&#x27; Medici in 1560. In 1536, the architect Philibert de l&#x27;Orme, upon his return from Rome, created the gardens of the Château d&#x27;Anet following the Italian rules of proportion. The carefully prepared harmony of Anet, with its parterres and surfaces of water integrated with sections of greenery, became one of the earliest and most influential examples of the classic French garden.

The French formal garden () contrasted with the design principles of the English landscape garden () namely, to &quot;force nature&quot; instead of leaving it undisturbed. Typical French formal gardens had &quot;parterres, geometrical shapes and neatly clipped topiary&quot;, in contrast to the English style of garden in which &quot;plants and shrubs seem to grow naturally without artifice.&quot; By the mid-17th century axial symmetry had ascended to prominence in the French gardening traditions of Andre Mollet and Jacques Boyceau, from which the latter wrote: &quot;All things, however beautiful they may be chosen, will be defective if they are not ordered and placed in proper symmetry.&quot; A good example of the French formal style are the Tuileries gardens in Paris which were originally designed during the reign of King Henry II in the mid-sixteenth century. The gardens were redesigned into the formal French style for the Sun King Louis XIV. The gardens were ordered into symmetrical lines: long rows of elm or chestnut trees, clipped hedgerows, along with parterres, &quot;reflect[ing] the orderly triumph of man&#x27;s will over nature.&quot;

The French landscape garden was influenced by the English landscape garden and gained prominence in the late eighteenth century.

==== United Kingdom ====
Before the Grand Manner era, a few significant gardens were found in Britain which were developed under the influence of the continent. Britain&#x27;s homegrown domestic gardening traditions were mostly practical in purpose, rather than aesthetic, unlike the grand gardens found mostly on castle grounds, and less commonly in universities. Tudor Gardens emphasized contrast rather than transitions, distinguished by color and illusion. They were not intended as a complement to home or architecture, but conceived as independent spaces, arranged to grow and display flowers and ornamental plants. Gardeners demonstrated their artistry in knot gardens, with complex arrangements most commonly included interwoven box hedges, and less commonly fragrant herbs like rosemary. Sanded paths run between the hedgings of open knots whereas closed knots were filled with single colored flowers. The knot and parterre gardens were always placed on level ground, and elevated areas reserved for terraces from which the intricacy of the gardens could be viewed.

Jacobean gardens were described as &quot;a delightful confusion&quot; by Henry Wotton in 1624. Under the influence of the Italian Renaissance, Caroline gardens began to shed some of the chaos of earlier designs, marking the beginning of a trends towards symmetrical unified designs that took the building architecture into account, and featuring an elevated terrace from which home and garden could be viewed. The only surviving Caroline garden is located at Bolsover Castle in Derbyshire, but is too simple to attract much interest. During the reign of Charles II, many new Baroque style country houses were built; while in England Oliver Cromwell sought to destroy many Tudor, Jacobean and Caroline style gardens.

==Design==

Garden design is the process of creating plans for the layout and planting of gardens and landscapes. Gardens may be designed by garden owners themselves, or by professionals. Professional garden designers tend to be trained in principles of design and horticulture, and have a knowledge and experience of using plants. Some professional garden designers are also landscape architects, a more formal level of training that usually requires an advanced degree and often an occupational license.

Elements of garden design include the layout of hard landscape, such as paths, rockeries, walls, water features, sitting areas and decking, as well as the plants themselves, with consideration for their horticultural requirements, their season-to-season appearance, lifespan, growth habit, size, speed of growth, and combinations with other plants and landscape features. Most gardens consist of a mixture of natural and constructed elements, although even very &#x27;natural&#x27; gardens are always an inherently artificial creation. Natural elements present in a garden principally comprise flora (such as trees and weeds), fauna (such as arthropods and birds), soil, water, air and light. Constructed elements include not only paths, patios, decking, sculptures, drainage systems, lights and buildings (such as sheds, gazebos, pergolas and follies), but also living constructions such as flower beds, ponds and lawns.

Garden needs of maintenance are also taken into consideration. Including the time or funds available for regular maintenance, (this can affect the choices of plants regarding speed of growth) spreading or self-seeding of the plants (annual or perennial), bloom-time, and many other characteristics. Garden design can be roughly divided into two groups, formal and naturalistic gardens. The most important consideration in any garden design is how the garden will be used, followed closely by the desired stylistic genres, and the way the garden space will connect to the home or other structures in the surrounding areas. All of these considerations are subject to the budget limitations. Budget limitations can be addressed by a simpler garden style with fewer plants and less costly hard landscape materials, seeds rather than sod for lawns, and plants that grow quickly; alternatively, garden owners may choose to create their garden over time, area by area.

==Types==

==Environmental impact==

Gardeners may cause environmental damage by the way they garden, or they may enhance their local environment.
Damage by gardeners can include direct destruction of natural habitats when houses and gardens are created; indirect habitat destruction and damage to provide garden materials such as peat, rock for rock gardens, and by the use of tapwater to irrigate gardens; the death of living beings in the garden itself, such as the killing not only of slugs and snails but also their predators such as hedgehogs and song thrushes by metaldehyde slug killer; the death of living beings outside the garden, such as local species extinction by indiscriminate plant collectors; and climate change caused by greenhouse gases produced by gardening.

===Climate change===
Gardeners can help to prevent climate change in many ways, including the use of trees, shrubs, ground cover plants and other perennial plants in their gardens, turning garden waste into soil organic matter instead of burning it, keeping soil and compost heaps aerated, avoiding peat, switching from power tools to hand tools or changing their garden design so that power tools are not needed, and using nitrogen-fixing plants instead of nitrogen fertiliser.

Climate change will have many impacts on gardens; some studies suggest most of them will be negative. Gardens also contribute to climate change. Greenhouse gases can be produced by gardeners in many ways. The three main greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Gardeners produce carbon dioxide directly by overcultivating soil and destroying soil carbon, by burning garden waste on bonfires, by using power tools which burn fossil fuel or use electricity generated by fossil fuels, and by using peat. Gardeners produce methane by compacting the soil and making it anaerobic, and by allowing their compost heaps to become compacted and anaerobic. Gardeners produce nitrous oxide by applying excess nitrogen fertiliser when plants are not actively growing so that the nitrogen in the fertiliser is converted by soil bacteria to nitrous oxide.

==Irrigation==
Some gardeners manage their gardens without using any water from outside the garden. Examples in Britain include Ventnor Botanic Garden on the Isle of Wight, and parts of Beth Chatto&#x27;s garden in Essex, Sticky Wicket garden in Dorset, and the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s gardens at Harlow Carr and Hyde Hall.
Rain gardens absorb rainfall falling onto nearby hard surfaces, rather than sending it into stormwater drains.

<doc id="42142" wikidata="Q1196408" url="?curid=42142" title="Historical fiction">
<text>Historical fiction is a literary genre in which a fictional plot takes place in the setting of particular real historical events. Although the term is commonly used as a synonym for historical fiction literature, it can also be applied to other types of narrative, including theatre, opera, cinema, and television, as well as video games and graphic novels. It often makes many use of symbolism in allegory using figurative and metaphorical elements to picture a story.

An essential element of historical fiction is that it is set in the past and pays attention to the manners, social conditions and other details of the depicted period. Authors also frequently choose to explore notable historical figures in these settings, allowing readers to better understand how these individuals might have responded to their environments. The historical romance usually seeks to romanticize eras of the past. Some subgenres such as alternate history and historical fantasy insert intentionally ahistorical or speculative elements into a novel.

Works of historical fiction are sometimes criticized for lack of authenticity because of readerly criticism or genre expectations for accurate period details. This tension between historical authenticity and fiction frequently becomes a point of comment for readers and popular critics, while scholarly criticism frequently goes beyond this commentary, investigating the genre for its other thematic and critical interests.

Historical fiction as a contemporary Western literary genre has its foundations in the early-19th-century works of Sir Walter Scott and his contemporaries in other national literatures such as the Frenchman Honoré de Balzac, the American James Fenimore Cooper, and later the Russian Leo Tolstoy. However, the melding of historical and fictional elements in individual works of literature has a long tradition in many cultures; both western traditions (as early as Ancient Greek and Latin literature) as well as Eastern, in the form of oral and folk traditions (see mythology and folklore), which produced epics, novels, plays and other fictional works describing history for contemporary audiences.

==Introduction==
Definitions differ as to what constitutes a historical novel. On the one hand the Historical Novel Society defines the genre as works &quot;written at least fifty years after the events described&quot;, while critic Sarah Johnson delineates such novels as &quot;set before the middle of the last [20th] century ... in which the author is writing from research rather than personal experience.&quot; Then again Lynda Adamson, in her preface to the bibliographic reference work &quot;World Historical Fiction&quot;, states that while a &quot;generally accepted definition&quot; for the historical novel is a novel &quot;about a time period at least 25 years before it was written&quot;, she also suggests that some people read novels written in the past, like those of Jane Austen (1775–1817), as if they were historical novels.

Historical fiction sometimes encouraged movements of romantic nationalism. Walter Scott&#x27;s Waverley novels created interest in Scottish history and still illuminate it. A series of novels by Józef Ignacy Kraszewski on the history of Poland popularized the country&#x27;s history after it had lost its independence in the Partitions of Poland. Henryk Sienkiewicz wrote several immensely popular novels set in conflicts between the Poles and predatory Teutonic Knights, rebelling Cossacks and invading Swedes. He won the 1905 Nobel Prize in literature. He also wrote the popular novel &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, which was about Nero&#x27;s Rome and the early Christians and has been adapted several times for film, in 1913, 1924, 1951, 2001 to only name the most prominent. Sigrid Undset&#x27;s &quot;Kristin Lavransdatter&quot; fulfilled a similar function for Norwegian history; Undset later won a Nobel Prize for Literature (1928).

Many early historical novels played an important role in the rise of European popular interest in the history of the Middle Ages. Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; often receives credit for fueling the movement to preserve the Gothic architecture of France, leading to the establishment of the &quot;Monuments historiques&quot;, the French governmental authority for historic preservation. Rita Monaldi and Francesco Sorti&#x27;s historical mystery saga &quot;Imprimateur Secretum Veritas Mysterium&quot; has increased interest in European history and features famous castrato opera singer Atto Melani as a detective and spy. Although the story itself is fiction, many of the persona and events are not. The book is based on research by Monaldi and Sorti, who researched information from 17th-century manuscripts and published works concerning the siege of Vienna, the plague and papacy of Pope Innocent XI.

The genre of the historical novel has also permitted some authors, such as the Polish novelist Bolesław Prus in his sole historical novel, &quot;Pharaoh&quot;, to distance themselves from their own time and place to gain perspective on society and on the human condition, or to escape the depredations of the censor.

In some historical novels, major historic events take place mostly off-stage, while the fictional characters inhabit the world where those events occur. Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Kidnapped&quot; recounts mostly private adventures set against the backdrop of the Jacobite troubles in Scotland. Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; is set amid the Gordon Riots, and &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; in the French Revolution.

In some works, the accuracy of the historical elements has been questioned, as in Alexandre Dumas&#x27; 1845 novel &quot;Queen Margot&quot;. Postmodern novelists such as John Barth and Thomas Pynchon operate with even more freedom, mixing historical characters and settings with invented history and fantasy, as in the novels &quot;The Sot-Weed Factor&quot; (1960) and &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; (1997) respectively. A few writers create historical fiction without fictional characters. One example is the series &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; by Colleen McCullough.

==History==
===History up to 17th century===

Historical prose fiction has a long tradition in world literature. Three of the Four Classics of Chinese novels were set in the distant past: Shi Nai&#x27;an&#x27;s 14th-century &quot;Water Margin&quot; concerns 12th-century outlaws; Luo Guanzhong&#x27;s 14th-century &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; concerns 3rd-century wars which ended the Han dynasty; Wu Cheng&#x27;en&#x27;s 16th-century &quot;Journey to the West&quot; concerns the 7th-century Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang. In addition to those, there was a wealth of historical novels that became popular in the literary circles during the Ming and Qing periods in Chinese history; they include Feng Menglong&#x27;s &quot;Dongzhou Lieguo Zhi&quot; (&quot;Chronicles of the Eastern Zhou Kingdoms&quot;), Chu Renhuo&#x27;s &quot;Sui Tang yanyi&quot; (&quot;Romance of the Sui and Tang dynasties&quot;), Xiong Damu&#x27;s &quot;Liang Song Nanbei Zhizhuan&quot; (&quot;Records of the Two Songs, South and North&quot;) and &quot;Quan han zhi zhuan&quot;, Yang Erzeng&#x27;s &quot;Dong Xi Jin yan yi&quot; (&quot;Romance of the Eastern and Western Jin dynasties&quot;), and Qian Cai&#x27;s &quot;The General Yue Fei&quot;, etc.

Classical Greek novelists were also &quot;very fond of writing novels about people and places of the past&quot;. &quot;The Iliad&quot; has been described as historic fiction, since it treats historic events, although its genre is generally considered epic poetry. Pierre Vidal-Naquet has suggested that Plato laid the foundations for the historical novel through the myth of Atlantis contained in his dialogues &quot;Timaeus&quot; and &quot;Critias&quot;. &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; (written before 1021) is a fictionalized account of Japanese court life about a century prior and its author asserted that her work could present a &quot;fuller and therefore &#x27;truer version of history.

One of the early examples of the historical novel in Europe is &quot;La Princesse de Clèves&quot;, a French novel published anonymously in March 1678. It is regarded by many as the beginning of the modern tradition of the psychological novel and as a great work. Its author generally is held to be Madame de La Fayette. The action takes place between October 1558 and November 1559 at the royal court of Henry II of France. The novel recreates that era with remarkable precision. Nearly every character – except the heroine – is a historical figure. Events and intrigues unfold with great faithfulness to documentary records. In the United Kingdom, the historical novel &quot;appears to have developed&quot; from &quot;La Princesse de Clèves&quot;, &quot;and then via the Gothic novel&quot;. Another early example is &quot;The Unfortunate Traveller&quot; by Thomas Nashe, published in 1594 and set during the reign of King Henry VIII.

===19th century===

Historical fiction rose to prominence in Europe during the early 19th century as part of the Romantic reaction to the Enlightenment, especially through the influence of the Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott, whose works were immensely popular throughout Europe. Among his early European followers we can find Willibald Alexis, Theodor Fontane, Bernhard Severin Ingemann, Miklós Jósika, Mór Jókai, Jakob van Lennep, Demetrius Bikelos, Enrique Gil y Carrasco, Carl Jonas Love Almqvist, Victor Rydberg, Andreas Munch, Alessandro Manzoni, Alfred de Vigny, Honoré de Balzac or Prosper Mérimée. Jane Porter&#x27;s 1803 novel &quot;Thaddeus of Warsaw&quot; is one of the earliest examples of the historical novel in English and went through at least 84 editions, including translation into French and German. The first true historical novel in English was in fact Maria Edgeworth&#x27;s &quot;Castle Rackrent&quot; (1800).

In the 20th century György Lukács argued that Scott was the first fiction writer who saw history not just as a convenient frame in which to stage a contemporary narrative, but rather as a distinct social and cultural setting. Scott&#x27;s Scottish novels such as &quot;Waverley&quot; (1814) and &quot;Rob Roy&quot; (1817) focused upon a middling character who sits at the intersection of various social groups in order to explore the development of society through conflict. &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1820) gained credit for renewing interest in the Middle Ages.

Many well-known writers from the United Kingdom published historical novels in the mid 19th century, the most notable include Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Romola&quot;, and Charles Kingsley&#x27;s &quot;Westward Ho!&quot; and &quot;Hereward the Wake&quot;. &quot;The Trumpet-Major&quot; (1880) is Thomas Hardy&#x27;s only historical novel, and is set in Weymouth during the Napoleonic wars, when the town was then anxious about the possibility of invasion by Napoleon.

In the United States, the first historical novelist was Samuel Woodworth, who wrote &quot;The Champions of American Freedom&quot; in 1816. James Fenimore Cooper was better known for his historical novels and was influenced by Scott. His most famous novel is &quot;The Last of the Mohicans: A Narrative of 1757&quot; (1826), the second book of the &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot; pentalogy. &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; is set in 1757, during the French and Indian War (the Seven Years&#x27; War), when France and Great Britain battled for control of North America. Cooper&#x27;s chief rival, John Neal, wrote &quot;Rachel Dyer&quot; (1828), the first bound novel about the 17th-century Salem witch trials. &quot;Rachel Dyer&quot; also influenced future American fiction set in this period, like &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (1850) by Nathaniel Hawthorne which is one of the most famous 19th-century American historical novels. Set in 17th-century Puritan Boston, Massachusetts during the years 1642 to 1649, it tells the story of Hester Prynne, who conceives a daughter through an affair and struggles to create a new life of repentance and dignity.
In French literature, the most prominent inheritor of Scott&#x27;s style of the historical novel was Balzac. In 1829 Balzac published &quot;Les Chouans&quot;, a historical work in the manner of Sir Walter Scott. This was subsequently incorporated into &quot;La Comédie Humaine&quot;. The bulk of &quot;La Comédie Humaine&quot;, however, takes place during the Bourbon Restoration and the July Monarchy, though there are several novels which take place during the French Revolution and others which take place of in the Middle Ages or the Renaissance, including &quot;About Catherine de Medici&quot; and &quot;The Elixir of Long Life&quot;.

Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1831) furnishes another 19th-century example of the romantic-historical novel. Victor Hugo began writing &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; in 1829, largely to make his contemporaries more aware of the value of the Gothic architecture, which was neglected and often destroyed to be replaced by new buildings, or defaced by replacement of parts of buildings in a newer style. The action takes place in 1482 and the title refers to the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, on which the story is centered. Alexandre Dumas also wrote several popular historical fiction novels, including &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; and &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. George Saintsbury stated: &quot;&quot;Monte Cristo&quot; is said to have been at its first appearance, and for some time subsequently, the most popular book in Europe.&quot; This popularity has extended into modern times as well. The book was &quot;translated into virtually all modern languages and has never been out of print in most of them. There have been at least twenty-nine motion pictures based on it ... as well as several television series, and many movies [have] worked the name &#x27;Monte Cristo&#x27; into their titles.&quot;

Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; offers an example of 19th-century historical fiction used to critique contemporary history. Tolstoy read the standard histories available in Russian and French about the Napoleonic Wars, and used the novel to challenge those historical approaches. At the start of the novel&#x27;s third volume, he describes his work as blurring the line between fiction and history, in order to get closer to the truth. The novel is set 60 years before it was composed, and alongside researching the war through primary and secondary sources, he spoke with people who had lived through war during the French invasion of Russia in 1812; thus, the book is also, in part, ethnography fictionalized.

&quot;The Charterhouse of Parma&quot; by Marie-Henri Beyle (Stendhal) is an epic retelling of the story of an Italian nobleman who lives through the Napoleonic period in Italian history. It includes a description of the Battle of Waterloo by the principal character. Stendhal fought with Napoleon and participated in the French invasion of Russia.

&quot;The Betrothed&quot; (1827) by Alessandro Manzoni has been called the most famous and widely read novel of the Italian language. &quot;The Betrothed&quot; was inspired by Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; but, compared to its model, shows some innovations (two members of the lower class as principal characters, the past described without romantic idealization, an explicitly Christian message), somehow forerunning the realistic novel of the following decades. Set in northern Italy in 1628, during the oppressive years under Spanish rule, it is sometimes seen as a veiled attack on Austria, which controlled the region at the time the novel was written.

The critical and popular success of &quot;The Betrothed&quot; gave rise to a crowd of imitations and, in the age of unification, almost every Italian writer tried his hand at the genre; novels now almost forgotten, like &quot;Marco Visconti&quot; by Tommaso Grossi (Manzoni&#x27;s best friend) or &quot;Ettore Fieramosca&quot; by Massimo D&#x27;Azeglio (Manzoni&#x27;s son-in-law), were the best-sellers of their time. Many of these authors (like Niccolò Tommaseo, Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi and D&#x27;Azeglio himself) were patriots and politicians too, and in their novels, the veiled politic message of Manzoni became explicit (the hero of &quot;Ettore Fieramosca&quot; fights to defend the honor of the Italian soldiers, mocked by some arrogant Frenchmen). In them, the narrative talent not equaled the patriotic passion, and their novels, full of rhetoric and melodramatic excesses, are today barely readable as historical documents. A significant exception is &quot;The Confessions of an Italian&quot; by Ippolito Nievo, an epic about the Venetian republic&#x27;s fall and the Napoleonic age, told with satiric irony and youthful brio (Nievo wrote it when he was 26 years old).

In Arabic literature, the Lebanese writer Jurji Zaydan (1861–1914) was the most prolific novelist of this genre. He wrote 23 historical novels between 1889 and 1914. His novels played an important in shaping the collective consciousness of modern Arabs during the Nahda period and educated them about their history. &quot;The Fleeing Mamluk&quot; (1891), &quot;The Captive of the Mahdi Pretender&quot; (1892), and &quot;Virgin of Quraish&quot; (1899) are some of his nineteenth-century historical novels.

===20th century===
====Germany====
A major 20th-century example of this genre is the German author Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; (1901). This chronicles the decline of a wealthy north German merchant family over the course of four generations, incidentally portraying the manner of life and mores of the Hanseatic bourgeoisie in the years from 1835 to 1877. Mann drew deeply from the history of his own family, the Mann family of Lübeck, and their milieu. This was Mann&#x27;s first novel, and with the publication of the 2nd edition in 1903, &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; became a major literary success. The work led to a Nobel Prize in Literature for Mann in 1929; although the Nobel award generally recognizes an author&#x27;s body of work, the Swedish Academy&#x27;s citation for Mann identified &quot;his great novel &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot;&quot; as the principal reason for his prize. Mann also wrote, between 1926 and 1943, a four-part novel &quot;Joseph and His Brothers&quot;. In it Mann retells the familiar biblical stories of Genesis, from Jacob to Joseph (chapters 27–50), setting it in the historical context of the reign of Akhenaten (1353–1336 BC) in ancient Egypt.

In the same era, Lion Feuchtwanger was one of the most popular and accomplished writers of historical novels, with publications between the 1920s and 1950s. His reputation began with the bestselling work, &quot;Jud Süß&quot; (1925), set in the eighteenth century, as well as historical novels written primarily in exile in France and California, including most prominently the &quot;Josephus trilogy&quot; set in Ancient Rome (1932 / 1935 / 1942), &quot;Goya&quot; (1951), and his novel &quot;Raquel: The Jewess of Toledo&quot; - set in Medieval Spain.

====Britain====
Robert Graves of Britain wrote several popular historical novels, including &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, &quot;King Jesus&quot;, &quot;The Golden Fleece&quot; and &quot;Count Belisarius&quot;. John Cowper Powys wrote two historical novels set in Wales, &quot;Owen Glendower&quot; (1941) and &quot;Porius&quot; (1951). The first deals with the rebellion of the Welsh Prince Owain Glyndŵr (AD 1400–16), while &quot;Porius&quot; takes place during the Dark Ages, in AD 499, just before the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain. Powys suggests parallels with these historical periods and Britain in the late 1930s and during World War II.

Other significant British novelists include Georgette Heyer, Naomi Mitchison and Mary Renault. Heyer essentially established the historical romance genre and its subgenre Regency romance, which was inspired by Jane Austen. To ensure accuracy, Heyer collected reference works and kept detailed notes on all aspects of Regency life. While some critics thought the novels were too detailed, others considered the level of detail to be Heyer&#x27;s greatest asset; Heyer even recreated William the Conqueror&#x27;s crossing into England for her novel &quot;The Conqueror&quot;. Naomi Mitchison&#x27;s finest novel, &quot;The Corn King and the Spring Queen&quot; (1931), is regarded by some as the best historical novel of the 20th century. Mary Renault is best known for her historical novels set in Ancient Greece. In addition to fictional portrayals of Theseus, Socrates, Plato, Simonides of Ceos and Alexander the Great, she wrote a non-fiction biography of Alexander. &quot;The Siege of Krishnapur&quot; (1973) by J. G. Farrell has been described as an &quot;outstanding novel&quot;. Inspired by events such as the sieges of Cawnpore and Lucknow, the book details the siege of a fictional Indian town, Krishnapur, during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 from the perspective of the town&#x27;s British residents. The main characters find themselves subject to the increasing strictures and deprivation of the siege, and the absurdity of maintaining the British class system in a town no one can leave becomes a source of comic invention, though the text is serious in intent and tone.

In Welsh literature, the major contributor to the genre in Welsh is William Owen Roberts (b. 1960). His historical novels include &quot;Y Pla&quot; (1987), set at the time of the Black Death; &quot;Paradwys&quot; (2001), 18th century, concerning the slave trade; and &quot;Petrograd&quot; (2008) and &quot;Paris&quot; (2013), concerning the Russian revolution and its aftermath. &quot;Y Pla&quot; has been much translated, appearing in English as &quot;Pestilence&quot;, and &quot;Petrograd&quot; and &quot;Paris&quot; have also appeared in English. A contemporary of Roberts&#x27; working in English is Christopher Meredith (b. 1954), whose &quot;Griffri&quot; (1991) is set in the 12th century and has the poet of a minor Welsh prince as narrator.

Nobel Prize laureate William Golding wrote a number of historical novels. &quot;The Inheritors&quot; (1955) is set in prehistoric times, and shows &quot;new people&quot; (generally identified with &quot;Homo sapiens sapiens&quot;) triumphing over a gentler race (generally identified with Neanderthals) by deceit and violence. &quot;The Spire&quot; (1964) follows the building (and near collapse) of a huge spire onto a medieval cathedral (generally assumed to be Salisbury Cathedral); the spire symbolizing both spiritual aspiration and worldly vanity. &quot;The Scorpion God&quot; (1971) consists of three novellas, the first set in a prehistoric African hunter-gatherer band (&quot;Clonk, Clonk&quot;), the second in an ancient Egyptian court (&quot;The Scorpion God&quot;) and the third in the court of a Roman emperor (&quot;Envoy Extraordinary&quot;). The trilogy &quot;To the Ends of the Earth&quot;, which includes the &quot;Rites of Passage&quot; (1980), &quot;Close Quarters&quot; (1987), and &quot;Fire Down Below&quot; (1989), describes sea voyages in the early 19th century. Anthony Burgess also wrote several historical novels; his last novel, &quot;A Dead Man in Deptford&quot;, is about the murder of Christopher Marlowe in the 16th century.

Though the genre has evolved since its inception, the historical novel remains popular with authors and readers to this day and bestsellers include Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s &quot;Aubrey–Maturin series&quot;, Ken Follett&#x27;s &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; and Dorothy Dunnett&#x27;s &quot;Lymond Chronicles&quot;. A development in British and Irish writing in the past 25 years has been a renewed interest in the First World War. Works include William Boyd&#x27;s &quot;An Ice-Cream War&quot;; Sebastian Faulks&#x27; &quot;Birdsong&quot; and &quot;The Girl at the Lion d&#x27;Or&quot; (concerned with the War&#x27;s consequences); Pat Barker&#x27;s &quot;Regeneration Trilogy&quot; and Sebastian Barry&#x27;s &quot;A Long Long Way&quot;.

====United States====

American Nobel laureate William Faulkner&#x27;s novel &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; (1936) is set before, during and after the American Civil War. Kenneth Roberts wrote several books set around the events of the American Revolution, of which &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; (1937), &quot;Oliver Wiswell&quot; (1940) and &quot;Lydia Bailey&quot; (1947) all became best-sellers in the 1930s and 1940s. The following American authors have also written historical novels in the 20th century: Gore Vidal, John Barth, Norman Mailer, E. L. Doctorow and William Kennedy. Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; (1997) tells the story of the two English surveyors, Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, who were charged with marking the boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland in the 18th century. More recently there have been works such as Neal Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Baroque Cycle&quot;.

====Italy====
In Italy, the tradition of historical fiction has flourished in the modern age, the nineteenth century in particular having caught writers’ interests. Southern Italian novelists like Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa (The Leopard), Francesco Iovine (&quot;Lady Ava&quot;), Carlo Alianello (&quot;The Heritage of the Prioress&quot;) and more recently Andrea Camilleri (&quot;The Preston Brewer&quot;) retold the events of the Italian Unification, at times overturning its traditionally heroic and progressive image. The conservative Riccardo Bacchelli in &quot;The Devil at the Long Point&quot; and the communist Vasco Pratolini in &quot;Metello&quot; described, from ideologically opposite points of view, the birth of Italian Socialism. Bacchelli also wrote &quot;The Mill on the Po&quot;, a patchwork saga of a family of millers from the time of Napoleon to the First World War, one of the most epic novels of the last century.

In 1980, Umberto Eco achieved international success with &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;, a novel set in an Italian abbey in 1327 readable as a historical mystery, as an allegory of Italy during the Years of Lead, and as an erudite joke. Eco&#x27;s work, like Manzoni&#x27;s preceding it, relaunched Italian interest in historical fiction. Many novelists who till then had preferred the contemporary novel tried their hand at stories set in previous centuries. Among them were Fulvio Tomizza (&quot;The Evil Coming from North&quot;, about the Reformation), Dacia Maraini (&quot;The Silent Duchess&quot;, about the female condition in the eighteenth century), Sebastiano Vassalli (&quot;The Chimera&quot;, about a witch hunt), Ernesto Ferrero (&quot;N&quot;) and Valerio Manfredi (&quot;The Last Legion&quot;).

====Bulgaria====
Fani Popova–Mutafova (1902–1977) was a Bulgarian author who is considered by many to have been the best-selling Bulgarian historical fiction author ever. Her books sold in record numbers in the 1930s and the early 1940s. However, she was eventually sentenced to seven years of imprisonment by the Bulgarian communist regime because of some of her writings celebrating Hitler, and though released after only eleven months for health reasons, was forbidden to publish anything between 1943 and 1972. Stoyan Zagorchinov (1889–1969) also a Bulgarian writer, author of &quot;Last Day, God&#x27;s Day&quot; trilogy and &quot;Ivaylo&quot;, continuing the tradition in the Bulgarian historical novel, led by Ivan Vazov. Yana Yazova (1912–1974) also has several novels that can be considered historical as &quot;&quot;Alexander of Macedon&quot;, her only novel on non-Bulgarian thematic, as well as her trilogy &quot;Balkani&quot;&quot;. Vera Mutafchieva (1929–2009) is the author of historical novels which were translated into 11 languages. Anton Donchev (1930–) is an old living author, whose first independent novel, &quot;Samuel&#x27;s Testimony&quot;, was published in 1961. His second book, &quot;Time of Parting&quot;, which dealt with the Islamization of the population in the Rhodopes during the XVII century was written in 1964. The novel was adapted in the serial movie &quot;Time of Violence&quot;, divided into two parts with the subtitles (&quot;The Threat&quot; and &quot;The Violence&quot;) by 1987 by the director Lyudmil Staykov. In June 2015, &quot;Time of Violence&quot; was chosen as the most beloved film of Bulgarian viewers in &quot;Laced Shoes of Bulgarian Cinema&quot;, a large-scale consultation with the audience of Bulgarian National Television.

====Scandinavia====
One of the best known Scandinavian historical novels is Sigrid Undset&#x27;s &quot;Kristin Lavransdatter&quot; (1920–1922) set in medieval Norway. For this trilogy Undset was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1928. Johannes V. Jensen&#x27;s trilogy &quot;Kongens fald&quot; (1900–1901, &quot;The Fall of the King&quot;), set in 16th century Denmark, has been called &quot;the finest historical novel in Danish literature&quot;. The epic historical novel series &quot;Den lange rejse&quot; (1908–1921, &quot;The Long Journey&quot;) is generally regarded as Jensen&#x27;s masterpiece and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1944 partly on the strength of it. The Finnish writer Mika Waltari is known for the historical novel &quot;The Egyptian&quot; (1945). Faroes–Danish writer William Heinesen wrote several historical novels, most notably &quot;Det gode håb&quot; (1964, &quot;Fair Hope&quot;) set in the Faroe Islands in 17th century.

Historical fiction has long been a popular genre in Sweden, especially since the 1960s a huge number of historical novels has been written. Nobel laureates Eyvind Johnson and Pär Lagerkvist wrote acclaimed historical novels such as &quot;Return to Ithaca&quot; (1946) and &quot;Barabbas&quot; (1950). Vilhelm Moberg&#x27;s &quot;Ride This Night&quot; (1941) is set in 16th century Småland and his widely read novel series &quot;The Emigrants&quot; tells the story of Småland emigrants to the United States in the 19th century. Per Anders Fogelström wrote a hugely popular series of five historical novels set in his native Stockholm beginning with &quot;City of My Dreams&quot; (1960). Other writers of historical fiction in Swedish literature include Sara Lidman, Birgitta Trotzig, Per Olov Enquist and Artur Lundkvist.

====Latin America====
The historical novel was quite popular in 20th century Latin American literature, including works such as &quot;The Kingdom of This World&quot; (1949) by Alejo Carpentier, &quot;I, the Supreme&quot; (1974) by Augusto Roa Bastos, &quot;Terra Nostra&quot; (1975) by Carlos Fuentes, &quot;News from the Empire&quot; (1987) by Fernando del Paso, &quot;The Lightning of August&quot; (1964) by Jorge Ibargüengoitia, &quot;The War of the End of the World&quot; (1981) by Mario Vargas Llosa and &quot;The Autumn of the Patriarch&quot; (1975) by Gabriel García Marquez. Other writers of historical fiction include Abel Posse, Antonio Benitez Rojo, João Ubaldo Ribeiro, Jorge Amado, Homero Aridjis.

===21st century===
In the first decades of the 21st century, an increased interest for historical fiction has been noted. One of the most successful writers of historical novels is Hilary Mantel. Other writers of historical fiction include Philippa Gregory, Bernard Cornwell, Sarah Waters, Ken Follett, George Saunders, Shirley Hazzard and Julie Orringer. The historical novel &quot;The Books of Jacob&quot; set in 18th century Poland has been praised as the magnum opus by the 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Olga Tokarczuk.

==Subgenres==
===Documentary fiction===
A 20th-century variant of the historical novel is documentary fiction, which incorporates &quot;not only historical characters and events, but also reports of everyday events&quot; found in contemporary newspapers. Examples of this variant form of historical novel include &quot;U.S.A.&quot; (1938), and &quot;Ragtime&quot; (1975) by E.L. Doctorow.

===Fictional biographies===

&quot;Memoirs of Hadrian&quot; by the Belgian-born French writer Marguerite Yourcenar is about the life and death of Roman Emperor Hadrian. First published in France in French in 1951 as &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;Hadrien&quot;, the book was an immediate success, meeting with enormous critical acclaim. Margaret George has written fictional biographies about historical persons in &quot;The Memoirs of Cleopatra&quot; (1997) and &quot;Mary, called Magdalene&quot; (2002). An earlier example is &quot;Peter I&quot; (1929–34) by Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy, and &quot;I, Claudius&quot; (1934) and &quot;King Jesus&quot; (1946) by Robert Graves. Other recent biographical novel series, include &quot;Conqueror&quot; and &quot;Emperor&quot; by Conn Iggulden and &quot;Cicero Trilogy&quot; by Robert Harris.

===Gothic fiction===

The gothic novel was popular in the late eighteenth century. Set in the historical past it has an interest in the mysterious, terrifying and haunting. Horace Walpole&#x27;s 1764 novel &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; is considered to be an influential work.

===Historical mysteries===
===Historical romance and family sagas===

Romantic themes have also been portrayed, such as &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; by Boris Pasternak and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; by Margaret Mitchell. One of the first popular historical romances appeared in 1921, when Georgette Heyer published &quot;The Black Moth&quot;, which is set in 1751. It was not until 1935 that she wrote the first of her signature Regency novels, set around the English Regency period (1811–1820), when the Prince Regent ruled England in place of his ill father, George III. Heyer&#x27;s Regency novels were inspired by Jane Austen&#x27;s novels of the late 18th and early 19th century. Because Heyer&#x27;s writing was set in the midst of events that had occurred over 100 years previously, she included authentic period detail in order for her readers to understand. Where Heyer referred to historical events, it was as background detail to set the period, and did not usually play a key role in the narrative. Heyer&#x27;s characters often contained more modern-day sensibilities, and more conventional characters in the novels would point out the heroine&#x27;s eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love.

===Nautical and pirate fiction===

Some historical novels explore life at sea, including C. S. Forester&#x27;s Hornblower series, Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s Aubrey–Maturin series, Alexander Kent&#x27;s The Bolitho novels, Dudley Pope&#x27;s Lord Ramage&#x27;s series, all of which all deal with the Napoleonic Wars. There are also adventure novels with pirate characters like Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1883), Emilio Salgari&#x27;s Sandokan (1895–1913) and &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (1922) by Rafael Sabatini. Recent examples of historical novels about pirates are &quot;The Adventures of Hector Lynch&quot; by Tim Severin, &quot;The White Devil (Белият Дявол)&quot; by Hristo Kalchev and &quot;The Pirate Devlin&quot; novels by Mark Keating.

===Alternative history===

===Historical Fantasy===
===Time travel fiction===

===Historiographic metafiction===
Historiographic metafiction combines historical fiction with metafiction. The term is closely associated with postmodern literature including writers such as Salman Rushdie and Thomas Pynchon.

Several novels by Nobel Prize laureate José Saramago are set in historical times including &quot;Baltasar and Blimunda&quot;, &quot;The Gospel According to Jesus Christ&quot; and &quot;The History of the Siege of Lisbon&quot;. In a parallel plot set in the 12th and 20th century where history and fiction are constantly overlapping, the latter novel questions the reliability of historical sources and deals with the difference of writing history and fiction.

===Children&#x27;s historical fiction===

A prominent subgenre within historical fiction is the children&#x27;s historical novel. Often following a pedagogical bent, children&#x27;s historical fiction may follow the conventions of many of the other subgenres of historical fiction. A number of such works include elements of historical fantasy or time travel to facilitate the transition between the contemporary world and the past in the tradition of children&#x27;s portal fiction. Sometimes publishers will commission series of historical novels that explore different periods and times. Among the most popular contemporary series include the American Girl novels and the Magic Tree House series. A prominent award within children&#x27;s historical fiction is the Scott O&#x27;Dell Award for Historical Fiction.

===Comics and graphic novels===

Historical narratives have also found their way in comics and graphic novels. There are Prehistorical elements in jungle comics like Akim and Rahan. Ancient Greece inspired graphic novels are &quot;300&quot; created by Frank Miller, centered around Battle of Thermopylae, and &quot;Age of Bronze series&quot; by Eric Shanower, that retells Trojan War. Historical subjects can also be found in manhua comics like &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Sun Zi&#x27;s Tactics&quot; by Lee Chi Ching, &quot;Weapons of the Gods&quot; by Wong Yuk Long as well as &quot;The Ravages of Time&quot; by Chan Mou. There are also straight Samurai manga series like &quot;Path of the Assassin&quot;, &quot;Vagabond&quot;, &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; and &quot;Azumi&quot;. Several comics and graphic novels have been produced into anime series or a movie adaptations like &quot;Azumi&quot; and &quot;300&quot;.

==The performing arts==
===Period drama films and television series===

Historical drama film stories are based upon historical events and famous people. Some historical dramas are docudramas, which attempt an accurate portrayal of a historical event or biography, to the degree that the available historical research will allow. Other historical dramas are fictionalized tales that are based on an actual person and their deeds, such as &quot;Braveheart&quot;, which is loosely based on the 13th-century knight William Wallace&#x27;s fight for Scotland&#x27;s independence. For films pertaining to the history of East Asia, Central Asia, and South Asia, there are historical drama films set in Asia, also known as Jidaigeki in Japan. Wuxia films like &quot;The Hidden Power of the Dragon Sabre&quot; (1984) and &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; (2000), based on novels by Jin Yong and Wang Dulu, have also been produced. Zhang Yimou has directed several acclaimed wuxia films like &quot;Hero&quot; (2002), &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; (2004) and &quot;Curse of the Golden Flower&quot; (2006). Although largely fictional some wuxia films are considered historical drama. Samurai films like Zatoichi and Lone Wolf and Cub series also fall under historical drama umbrella. Peplum films also known as sword-and-sandal, is a genre of largely Italian-made historical or biblical epics (costume dramas) that dominated the Italian film industry from 1958 to 1965. Most pepla featured a superhumanly strong man as the protagonist, such as Hercules, Samson, Goliath, Ursus or Italy&#x27;s own popular folk hero Maciste. These supermen often rescued captive princesses from tyrannical despots and fought mythological creatures. Not all the films were fantasy-based, however. Many featured actual historical personalities such as Julius Caesar, Cleopatra, and Hannibal, although great liberties were taken with the storylines. Gladiators, pirates, knights, Vikings, and slaves rebelling against tyrannical kings were also popular subjects. There are also films based on Medieval narratives like Ridley Scott&#x27;s historical epics &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (2010) and &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; (2005) and the subgenred films based on the Arthurian legend such as &quot;&quot; (2008) and &quot;King Arthur&quot; (2004).

Many historical narratives have been expanded into television series. Notable ancient history inspired TV series include: &quot;Rome&quot;, &quot;Spartacus&quot;, &quot;Egypt&quot;, &quot;The Last Kingdom&quot; and &quot;I Claudius&quot;. Tudor England is also a very prominent subject in television series like &quot;The Tudors&quot;, &quot;The Virgin Queen&quot; and &quot;Elizabeth I&quot;. Programs about the Napoleonic Wars have also been produced, like &quot;Sharpe&quot; and &quot;Hornblower&quot;. Historical soap operas have also been popular, including the Turkish TV series &quot;The Magnificent Century&quot; and &quot;Once Upon A Time In The Ottoman Empire: Rebellion&quot;. Chinese studios have also produced television series like &quot;The Legend and the Hero&quot;, its &quot;sequel series&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s War&quot; and &quot;The Qin Empire&quot;. There have also been produced pure Wuxia television series, many based on works by Jin Yong like &quot;Condor Trilogy&quot; and &quot;Swordsman&quot;, also &quot;Lu Xiaofeng&quot; and &quot;Chu Liuxiang&quot; by Gu Long. They have been very popular in China, but largely unnoticed in Western media.

===The theatre===
====History plays====

History is one of the three main genres in Western theatre alongside tragedy and comedy, although it originated, in its modern form, thousands of years later than the other primary genres. For this reason, it is often treated as a subset of tragedy. A play in this genre is known as a history play and is based on a historical narrative, often set in the medieval or early modern past. History emerged as a distinct genre from tragedy in Renaissance England. The best known examples of the genre are the history plays written by William Shakespeare, whose plays still serve to define the genre. Shakespeare wrote numerous history plays, some included in the First Folio as histories, and other listed as tragedies, or Roman plays. Among the most famous histories are &quot;Richard III&quot;, and &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, and &quot;Henry V&quot;. Other plays that feature historical characters, are the tragedy &quot;Macbeth&quot;, set in the mid-11th century during the reigns of Duncan I of Scotland and Edward the Confessor, and the Roman plays &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. Another tragedy &quot;King Lear&quot;, is based on British legend, as is the romanc &quot;Cymbeline, King of Britain&quot;, which is set in Ancient Britain.

Other playwrights contemporary to Shakespeare, such as Christopher Marlowe, also dramatized historical topics. Marlowe wrote &quot;Edward the Second&quot; which deals with the deposition of King Edward II by his barons and the Queen, who resent the undue influence the king&#x27;s favourites have in court and state affairs, and &quot;The Massacre at Paris&quot;, which dramatizes the events of the Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre in France in 1572. Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Tamburlaine the Great&quot; (1587 or 1588) is a play in two parts, loosely based on the life of the Central Asian emperor, Timur &quot;the lame&quot;.

History plays also appear elsewhere in other western literature. The German authors Goethe and Schiller wrote a number of historical plays, including Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Egmont&quot; (1788), which is set in the 16th century, and is heavily influenced by Shakespearean tragedy, and Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Mary Stuart&quot;, which depicts the last days of Mary, Queen of Scots (1800). This play formed the basis for Donizetti&#x27;s opera &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; (1834). Beethoven wrote incidental music for &quot;Egmont&quot;.

Later Irish author George Bernard Shaw wrote several histories, including &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; (1898) and &quot;Saint Joan&quot;, which based on the life and trial of Joan of Arc. Published in 1924, not long after the canonization of Joan of Arc by the Roman Catholic Church, the play dramatises what is known of her life based on the substantial records of her trial. One of the most famous 20th-century history plays is &quot;The Life of Galileo&quot; by Bertolt Brecht which dramatises the latter period of the life of Galileo Galilei, the great Italian natural philosopher, who was persecuted by the Roman Catholic Church for the promulgation of his scientific discoveries; for details, see Galileo affair. The play embraces such themes as the conflict between dogmatism and scientific evidence, as well as interrogating the values of constancy in the face of oppression.

More recently British dramatist Howard Brenton has written several histories. He gained notoriety for his play &quot;The Romans in Britain&quot;, first staged at the National Theatre in October 1980, which drew parallels between the Roman invasion of Britain in 54BC and the contemporary British military presence in Northern Ireland. Its concerns with politics were, however, overshadowed by controversy surrounding a rape scene. Brenton also wrote &quot;Anne Boleyn&quot; a play on the life of Anne Boleyn, which premiered at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe in 2010. Anne Boleyn is portrayed as a significant force in the political and religious in-fighting at court and a furtherer of the cause of Protestantism in her enthusiasm for the Tyndale Bible.

====Opera====

One of the first operas to use historical events and people is Claudio Monteverdi&#x27;s L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea, which was first performed in Venice during the 1643 carnival season. it describes how Poppaea, mistress of the Roman emperor Nero, is able to achieve her ambition and be crowned empress. The opera was revived in Naples in 1651, but was then neglected until the rediscovery of the score in 1888, after which it became the subject of scholarly attention in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1960s, the opera has been performed and recorded many times. George Frederick Handel also wrote several operas based on historical characters, including &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; (1724), &quot;Tamerlano&quot; (1724) and &quot;Rodelinda&quot; (1725).

Historical subjects for operas also developed during the 19th century. Usually with 4 or 5 acts, they are large-scale casts and orchestras, and spectacular staging. Several operas by Gaspare Spontini, Luigi Cherubini, and Gioachino Rossini can be regarded as precursors to French grand opera. These include Spontini&#x27;s &quot;La vestale&quot; (1807) and &quot;Fernand Cortez&quot; (1809, revised 1817), Cherubini&#x27;s &quot;Les Abencérages&quot; (1813), and Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Le siège de Corinthe&quot; (1827) and &quot;Moïse et Pharaon&quot; (1828). All of these have some of the characteristics of size and spectacle that are normally associated with French grand opera. Another important forerunner was &quot;Il crociato in Egitto&quot; by Meyerbeer, who eventually became the acknowledged king of the grand opera genre. Amongst the most important opera composers on historical topics are Giuseppe Verdi, and Richard Wagner.

Russian composers also wrote operas based on historical figures, including &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; by Modest Mussorgsky (1839–1881), which was composed between 1868 and 1873, and is considered his masterpiece. Its subjects are the Russian ruler Boris Godunov, who reigned as Tsar (1598 to 1605). Equally famous is Alexander Borodin&#x27;s &quot;Prince Igor&quot;, the libretto for which the composer developed from the Ancient Russian epic &quot;The Lay of Igor&#x27;s Host&quot;, which recounts the campaign of Rus prince Igor Svyatoslavich against the invading Cuman (&quot;Polovtsian&quot;) tribes in 1185.

===Historical reenactment===

Historical reenactment is an educational or entertainment activity in which people follow a plan to recreate aspects of a historical event or period. This may be as narrow as a specific moment from a battle, such as the reenactment of Pickett&#x27;s Charge presented during the Great Reunion of 1913, or as broad as an entire period, such as Regency reenactment or The 1920s Berlin Project.

==Theory and criticism==
The Marxist literary critic, essayist, and social theorist György Lukács wrote extensively on the aesthetic and political significance of the historical novel. In 1937&#x27;s &quot;Der historische Roman&quot;, published originally in Russian, Lukács developed critical readings of several historical novels by various authors, including Gottfried Keller, Charles Dickens, and Gustave Flaubert. He interprets the advent of the &quot;genuinely&quot; historical novel at the beginning of the 19th century in terms of two developments, or processes. The first is the development of a specific genre in a specific medium—the historical novel&#x27;s unique stylistic and narrative elements. The second is the development of a representative, organic artwork that can capture the fractures, contradictions, and problems of the particular productive mode of its time (i.e., developing, early, entrenched capitalism).
