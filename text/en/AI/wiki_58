<text>Victor-Marie Hugo, vicomte Hugo (; 26 February 1802 – 22 May 1885) was a French Romantic author, poet, essayist, playwright, and politician. During a literary career that spanned more than sixty years, he wrote in a variety of genres and forms.

His most famous works are the novels &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; (1831) and &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1862). In France, Hugo is renowned for his poetry collections, such as and (&quot;The Legend of the Ages&quot;). Hugo was at the forefront of the Romantic literary movement with his play &quot;Cromwell&quot; and drama &quot;Hernani&quot;. His works have inspired music, both during his lifetime and after his death, including the opera &quot;Rigoletto&quot; and the musicals &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot;. He produced more than 4,000 drawings in his lifetime, and campaigned for social causes such as the abolition of capital punishment and slavery.

Although he was a committed royalist when young, Hugo&#x27;s views changed as the decades passed, and he became a passionate supporter of republicanism, serving in politics as both deputy and senator. His work touched upon most of the political and social issues and the artistic trends of his time. His opposition to absolutism, and his literary stature, established him as a national hero. Hugo died on 22 May 1885, aged 83. He was given a state funeral in the Panthéon of Paris, which was attended by over two million people, the largest in French history.

== Early life ==
Victor-Marie Hugo was born on 26 February 1802 (7 Ventôse, year X of the Republic) in in Eastern France. He was the youngest son of Joseph Léopold Sigisbert Hugo (1774–1828), a general in the Napoleonic army, and Sophie Trébuchet (1772–1821). The couple had two other sons: Abel Joseph (1798–1855) and (1800–1837). The Hugo family came from Nancy in Lorraine, where Hugo&#x27;s grandfather was a wood merchant. Léopold enlisted in the army of Revolutionary France at fourteen. He was an atheist and an ardent supporter of the Republic. Hugo&#x27;s mother Sophie was loyal to the deposed dynasty but would declare her children to be Protestants. They met in Châteaubriant in 1796 and married the following year.

Since Hugo&#x27;s father was an officer in Napoleon&#x27;s army, the family moved frequently from posting to posting. Léopold Hugo wrote to his son that he had been conceived on one of the highest peaks in the Vosges Mountains, on a journey from Lunéville to Besançon. &quot;This elevated origin,&quot; he went on, &quot;seems to have had effects on you so that your muse is now continually sublime.&quot; Hugo believed himself to have been conceived on 24 June 1801, which is the origin of Jean Valjean&#x27;s prisoner number 24601.

In 1810, Hugo&#x27;s father was made Count Hugo de Cogolludo y Sigüenza by then King of Spain Joseph Bonaparte, though it seems that the Spanish title was not legally recognized in France. Hugo later titled himself as a viscount, and it was as &quot;Vicomte Victor Hugo&quot; that he was appointed a peer of France on 13 April 1845.

Weary of the constant moving required by military life, Sophie separated temporarily from Léopold and settled in Paris in 1803 with her sons. There, she began seeing General Victor Fanneau de La Horie, Hugo&#x27;s godfather, who had been a comrade of General Hugo&#x27;s during the campaign in Vendee. In October 1807, the family rejoined Leopold, now Colonel Hugo, Governor of the province of Avellino. There, Hugo was taught mathematics by Giuseppe de Samuele Cagnazzi, elder brother of Italian scientist Luca de Samuele Cagnazzi. Sophie found out that Leopold had been living in secret with an Englishwoman called Catherine Thomas.

Soon, Hugo&#x27;s father was called to Spain to fight the Peninsular War. Madame Hugo and her children were sent back to Paris in 1808, where they moved to an old convent, 12 , an isolated mansion in a deserted quarter of the left bank of the Seine. Hiding in a chapel at the back of the garden was de La Horie, who had conspired to restore the Bourbons and been condemned to death a few years earlier. He became a mentor to Hugo and his brothers.

In 1811, the family joined their father in Spain. Hugo and his brothers were sent to school in Madrid at the while Sophie returned to Paris on her own, now officially separated from her husband. In 1812, as the Peninsular War was turning against France, de La Horie was arrested and executed. In February 1815, Hugo and Eugène were taken away from their mother and placed by their father in the Pension Cordier, a private boarding school in Paris, where Hugo and Eugène remained for three years while also attending lectures at Lycée Louis le Grand.
On 10 July 1816, Hugo wrote in his diary: &quot;I shall be Chateaubriand or nothing.&quot; In 1817, he wrote a poem for a competition organised by the Academie Française, for which he received an honorable mention. The Academicians refused to believe that he was only fifteen. Hugo moved in with his mother to 18 the following year and began attending law school. Hugo fell in love and secretly became engaged, against his mother&#x27;s wishes, to his childhood friend Adèle Foucher. In June 1821, Sophie Trebuchet died, and Léopold married his long-time mistress Catherine Thomas a month later. Hugo married Adèle the following year. In 1819, Hugo and his brothers began publishing a periodical called .

== Career ==
Hugo published his first novel (&quot;Hans of Iceland&quot;, 1823) the year following his marriage, and his second three years later (&quot;Bug-Jargal&quot;, 1826). Between 1829 and 1840, he published five more volumes of poetry: Les Orientales, 1829; Les Feuilles d&#x27;automne, 1831; , 1835; Les Voix intérieures, 1837; and Les Rayons et les Ombres, 1840. This cemented his reputation as one of the greatest elegiac and lyric poets of his time.

Like many young writers of his generation, Hugo was profoundly influenced by , the famous figure in the literary movement of Romanticism and France&#x27;s pre-eminent literary figure during the early 19th century. In his youth, Hugo resolved to be &quot; or nothing&quot;, and his life would come to parallel that of his predecessor in many ways. Like , Hugo furthered the cause of Romanticism, became involved in politics (though mostly as a champion of Republicanism), and was forced into exile due to his political stances. Along with Chateaubriand he attended the Coronation of Charles X in Reims in 1825.

The precocious passion and eloquence of Hugo&#x27;s early work brought success and fame at an early age. His first collection of poetry () was published in 1822 when he was only 20 years old and earned him a royal pension from Louis XVIII. Though the poems were admired for their spontaneous fervor and fluency, the collection that followed four years later in 1826 () revealed Hugo to be a great poet, a natural master of lyric and creative song.
Victor Hugo&#x27;s first mature work of fiction was published in February 1829 by Charles Gosselin without the author&#x27;s name and reflected the acute social conscience that would infuse his later work. (&quot;The Last Day of a Condemned Man&quot;) would have a profound influence on later writers such as Albert Camus, Charles Dickens, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. &quot;Claude Gueux,&quot; a documentary short story about a real-life murderer who had been executed in France, was published in 1834. Hugo himself later considered it to be a precursor to his great work on social injustice, .

Hugo became the figurehead of the Romantic literary movement with the plays &quot;Cromwell&quot; (1827) and &quot;Hernani&quot; (1830). &quot;Hernani&quot; announced the arrival of French romanticism: performed at the Comédie-Française, it was greeted with several nights of rioting as romantics and traditionalists clashed over the play&#x27;s deliberate disregard for neo-classical rules. Hugo&#x27;s popularity as a playwright grew with subsequent plays, such as &quot;Marion Delorme&quot; (1831), &quot;Le roi s&#x27;amuse&quot; (1832), and &quot;Ruy Blas&quot; (1838). Hugo&#x27;s novel (&quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot;) was published in 1831 and quickly translated into other languages across Europe. One of the effects of the novel was to shame the City of Paris into restoring the much neglected Cathedral of Notre Dame, which was attracting thousands of tourists who had read the popular novel.

Hugo began planning a major novel about social misery and injustice as early as the 1830s, but a full 17 years were needed for to be realised and finally published in 1862. Hugo had previously used the departure of prisoners for the Bagne of Toulon in &quot;Le Dernier Jour d&#x27;un condamné&quot;. He went to Toulon to visit the Bagne in 1839 and took extensive notes, though he did not start writing the book until 1845. On one of the pages of his notes about the prison, he wrote in large block letters a possible name for his hero: &quot;JEAN TRÉJEAN&quot;. When the book was finally written, Tréjean became Jean Valjean.

Hugo was acutely aware of the quality of the novel, as evidenced in a letter he wrote to his publisher, Albert Lacroix, on 23 March 1862: &quot;My conviction is that this book is going to be one of the peaks, if not the crowning point of my work.&quot; Publication of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; went to the highest bidder. The Belgian publishing house and undertook a marketing campaign unusual for the time, issuing press releases about the work a full six months before the launch. It also initially published only the first part of the novel (&quot;Fantine&quot;), which was launched simultaneously in major cities. Installments of the book sold out within hours and had an enormous impact on French society.
The critical establishment was generally hostile to the novel; found it insincere, complained of its vulgarity, found within it &quot;neither truth nor greatness&quot;, the brothers lambasted its artificiality, and —despite giving favourable reviews in newspapers—castigated it in private as &quot;repulsive and inept&quot;. However, &quot;Les Misérables&quot; proved popular enough with the masses that the issues it highlighted were soon on the agenda of the National Assembly of France. Today, the novel remains his best-known work. It is popular worldwide and has been adapted for cinema, television, and stage shows.

An apocryphal tale has circulated, describing the shortest correspondence in history as having been between Hugo and his publisher Hurst and Blackett in 1862. Hugo was on vacation when was published. He queried the reaction to the work by sending a single-character telegram to his publisher, asking . The publisher replied with a single to indicate its success. Hugo turned away from social/political issues in his next novel, (&quot;Toilers of the Sea&quot;), published in 1866. The book was well received, perhaps due to the previous success of . Dedicated to the channel island of Guernsey, where Hugo spent 15 years of exile, the novel tells of a man who attempts to win the approval of his beloved&#x27;s father by rescuing his ship, intentionally marooned by its captain who hopes to escape with a treasure of money it is transporting, through an exhausting battle of human engineering against the force of the sea and an almost mythical beast of the sea, a giant squid. Superficially an adventure, one of Hugo&#x27;s biographers calls it a &quot;metaphor for the 19th century–technical progress, creative genius and hard work overcoming the immanent evil of the material world.&quot;

The word used in Guernsey to refer to squid (, also sometimes applied to octopus) was to enter the French language as a result of its use in the book. Hugo returned to political and social issues in his next novel, (&quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot;), which was published in 1869 and painted a critical picture of the aristocracy. The novel was not as successful as his previous efforts, and Hugo himself began to comment on the growing distance between himself and literary contemporaries such as and , whose realist and naturalist novels were now exceeding the popularity of his own work.

His last novel, (&quot;Ninety-Three&quot;), published in 1874, dealt with a subject that Hugo had previously avoided: the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution. Though Hugo&#x27;s popularity was on the decline at the time of its publication, many now consider &quot;Ninety-Three&quot; to be a work on par with Hugo&#x27;s better-known novels.

==Political life and exile==

After three unsuccessful attempts, Hugo was finally elected to the in 1841, solidifying his position in the world of French arts and letters. A group of French academicians, particularly , were fighting against the &quot;romantic evolution&quot; and had managed to delay Victor Hugo&#x27;s election. Thereafter, he became increasingly involved in French politics.

On the nomination of King , Hugo entered the Upper Chamber of Parliament as a in 1845, where he spoke against the death penalty and social injustice, and in favour of freedom of the press and self-government for Poland.

In 1848, Hugo was elected to the National Assembly of the Second Republic as a conservative. In 1849, he broke with the conservatives when he gave a noted speech calling for the end of misery and poverty. Other speeches called for universal suffrage and free education for all children. Hugo&#x27;s advocacy to abolish the death penalty was renowned internationally.
When Louis Napoleon (Napoleon III) seized complete power in 1851, establishing an anti-parliamentary constitution, Hugo openly declared him a traitor to France. He moved to Brussels, then Jersey, from which he was expelled for supporting &quot;L&#x27;Homme&quot;, a local newspaper that had published a letter to Queen Victoria by a French republican deemed treasonous. He finally settled with his family at Hauteville House in Saint Peter Port, Guernsey, where he would live in exile from October 1855 until 1870.

While in exile, Hugo published his famous political pamphlets against Napoleon III, and . The pamphlets were banned in France but nonetheless had a strong impact there. He also composed or published some of his best work during his period in Guernsey, including , and three widely praised collections of poetry (, 1853; , 1856; and , 1859).

However, Víctor Hugo said in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;:

Like most of his contemporaries, Hugo justified colonialism in terms of a civilizing mission and putting an end to the slave trade on the Barbary coast. In a speech delivered on 18 May 1879, during a banquet to celebrate the abolition of slavery, in the presence of the French abolitionist writer and parliamentarian Victor Schœlcher, Hugo declared that the Mediterranean Sea formed a natural divide between &quot;ultimate civilisation and... utter barbarism.&quot; Hugo declared that &quot;God offers Africa to Europe. Take it&quot; and &quot;in the nineteenth century the white man made a man out of the black, in the twentieth century Europe will make a world out of Africa&quot;.

This might partly explain why, in spite of his deep interest and involvement in political matters, he remained silent on the Algerian issue. He knew about the atrocities committed by the French Army during the French conquest of Algeria as evidenced by his diary but he never denounced them publicly; however, in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, Hugo wrote: &quot;Algeria too harshly conquered, and, as in the case of India by the English, with more barbarism than civilization.&quot;
After coming in contact with Victor Schœlcher, a writer who fought for the abolition of slavery and French colonialism in the Caribbean, he started strongly campaigning against slavery. In a letter to American abolitionist Maria Weston Chapman, on 6 July 1851, Hugo wrote: &quot;Slavery in the United States! It is the duty of this republic to set such a bad example no longer... The United States must renounce slavery, or they must renounce liberty.&quot; In 1859, he wrote a letter asking the United States government, for the sake of their own reputation in the future, to spare abolitionist John Brown&#x27;s life, Hugo justified Brown&#x27;s actions by these words: &quot;Assuredly, if insurrection is ever a sacred duty, it must be when it is directed against Slavery.&quot; Hugo agreed to diffuse and sell one of his best known drawings, &quot;Le Pendu&quot;, an homage to John Brown, so one could &quot;keep alive in souls the memory of this liberator of our black brothers, of this heroic martyr John Brown, who died for Christ just as Christ.

As a novelist, diarist, and member of Parliament, Victor Hugo fought a lifelong battle for the abolition of the death penalty. &quot;The Last Day of a Condemned Man&quot; published in 1829 analyses the pangs of a man awaiting execution; several entries in &quot;Things Seen&quot; (&quot;Choses vues&quot;), the diary he kept between 1830 and 1885, convey his firm condemnation of what he regarded as a barbaric sentence; on 15 September 1848, seven months after the Revolution of 1848, he delivered a speech before the Assembly and concluded, &quot;You have overthrown the throne. ... Now overthrow the scaffold.&quot; His influence was credited in the removal of the death penalty from the constitutions of Geneva, Portugal, and Colombia. He had also pleaded for Benito Juárez to spare the recently captured emperor Maximilian I of Mexico, but to no avail.

Although Napoleon III granted an amnesty to all political exiles in 1859, Hugo declined, as it meant he would have to curtail his criticisms of the government. It was only after Napoleon III fell from power and the Third Republic was proclaimed that Hugo finally returned to his homeland in 1870, where he was promptly elected to the National Assembly and the Senate.

He was in Paris during the siege by the Prussian Army in 1870, famously eating animals given to him by the Paris Zoo. As the siege continued, and food became ever more scarce, he wrote in his diary that he was reduced to &quot;eating the unknown&quot;.

During the Paris Commune—the revolutionary government that took power on 18 March 1871 and was toppled on 28 May—Victor Hugo was harshly critical of the atrocities committed on both sides. On 9 April, he wrote in his diary, &quot;In short, this Commune is as idiotic as the National Assembly is ferocious. From both sides, folly.&quot; Yet he made a point of offering his support to members of the Commune subjected to brutal repression. He had been in Brussels since 22 March 1871 when in the 27 May issue of the Belgian newspaper &quot;l&#x27;Indépendance&quot; Victor Hugo denounced the government&#x27;s refusal to grant political asylum to the Communards threatened with imprisonment, banishment or execution. This caused so much uproar that in the evening a mob of fifty to sixty men attempted to force their way into the writer&#x27;s house shouting, &quot;Death to Victor Hugo! Hang him! Death to the scoundrel!&quot;

Hugo, who said &quot;A war between Europeans is a civil war,&quot; was a strong advocate for the creation of the United States of Europe. He expounded his views on the subject in a speech he delivered during the International Peace Congress which took place in Paris in 1849. Here he declared &quot;nations of the continent, will, without losing your distinctive qualities and glorious individuality, be blended into a superior unity and constitute a European fraternity, just as Normandy, Brittany, Burgundy, Lorraine, have been blended into France&quot;, this new state would be administered by &quot;a great Sovereign senate which will be to Europe what the Parliament is to England&quot;.

Because of his concern for the rights of artists and copyright, he was a founding member of the , which led to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. However, in &#x27;s published archives, he states strongly that &quot;any work of art has two authors: the people who confusingly feel something, a creator who translates these feelings, and the people again who consecrate his vision of that feeling. When one of the authors dies, the rights should totally be granted back to the other, the people.&quot; He was one of the earlier supporters of the concept of &quot;domaine public payant&quot;, under which a nominal fee would be charged for copying or performing works in the public domain, and this would go into a common fund dedicated to helping artists, especially young people.

==Religious views==

Hugo&#x27;s religious views changed radically over the course of his life. In his youth and under the influence of his mother, he identified as a Catholic and professed respect for Church hierarchy and authority. From there he became a non-practising Catholic and increasingly expressed anti-Catholic and anti-clerical views. He frequented spiritism during his exile (where he participated also in many séances conducted by Madame Delphine de Girardin) and in later years settled into a rationalist deism similar to that espoused by Voltaire. A census-taker asked Hugo in 1872 if he was a Catholic, and he replied, &quot;No. A Freethinker.&quot;

After 1872, Hugo never lost his antipathy towards the Catholic Church. He felt the Church was indifferent to the plight of the working class under the oppression of the monarchy. Perhaps he also was upset by the frequency with which his work appeared on the Church&#x27;s list of banned books. Hugo counted 740 attacks on &quot;Les Misérables&quot; in the Catholic press. When Hugo&#x27;s sons Charles and died, he insisted that they be buried without a crucifix or priest. In his will, he made the same stipulation about his own death and funeral.

Yet he believed in life after death and prayed every single morning and night, convinced as he wrote in &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot; that &quot;Thanksgiving has wings and flies to its right destination. Your prayer knows its way better than you do.&quot;

Hugo&#x27;s rationalism can be found in poems such as &quot;Torquemada&quot; (1869, about religious fanaticism), &quot;The Pope&quot; (1878, anti-clerical), &quot;Religions and Religion&quot; (1880, denying the usefulness of churches) and, published posthumously, &quot;The End of Satan&quot; and &quot;God&quot; (1886 and 1891 respectively, in which he represents Christianity as a griffin and rationalism as an angel). 
&quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; also garnered attention due to its portrayal of the abuse of power by the church, even getting listed as one of the &quot;forbidden books&quot; by it. In fact, earlier adaptations had to change the villain, Claude Frollo from being a priest to avoid backlash.

Vincent van Gogh ascribed the saying &quot;Religions pass away, but God remains,&quot; actually by Jules Michelet, to Hugo.

==Relationship with music==
Although Hugo&#x27;s many talents did not include exceptional musical ability, he nevertheless had a great impact on the music world through the inspiration that his works provided for composers of the 19th and 20th centuries. Hugo himself particularly enjoyed the music of Gluck, Mozart, Weber and Meyerbeer. In , he calls the huntsman&#x27;s chorus in Weber&#x27;s &quot;Euryanthe&quot;, &quot;perhaps the most beautiful piece of music ever composed&quot;. He also greatly admired Beethoven and, rather unusually for his time, appreciated works by composers from earlier centuries such as Palestrina and Monteverdi.

Two famous musicians of the 19th century were friends of Hugo: Hector Berlioz and Franz Liszt. The latter played Beethoven in Hugo&#x27;s home, and Hugo joked in a letter to a friend that, thanks to Liszt&#x27;s piano lessons, he learned how to play a favourite song on the piano – with only one finger. Hugo also worked with composer Louise Bertin, writing the libretto for her 1836 opera &quot;La Esmeralda&quot;, which was based on the character in &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;. Although for various reasons the opera closed soon after its fifth performance and is little known today, it has enjoyed a modern revival, both in a piano/song concert version by Liszt at the 2007 and in a full orchestral version presented in July 2008 at . He was also on friendly terms with Frederic Chopin. He introduced him to George Sand who would be his lover for years. In 1849, Hugo attended Chopin&#x27;s funeral.

On the other hand, he had low esteem for Richard Wagner, whom he described as &quot;a man of talent coupled with imbecility.&quot;

Well over one thousand musical compositions have been inspired by Hugo&#x27;s works from the 19th century until the present day. In particular, Hugo&#x27;s plays, in which he rejected the rules of classical theatre in favour of romantic drama, attracted the interest of many composers who adapted them into operas. More than one hundred operas are based on Hugo&#x27;s works and among them are Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot; (1833), Verdi&#x27;s (1851) and &quot;Ernani&quot; (1844), and &#x27;s (1876).

Hugo&#x27;s novels, as well as his plays, have been a great source of inspiration for musicians, stirring them to create not only opera and ballet but musical theatre such as and the ever-popular , London West End&#x27;s longest running musical. Additionally, Hugo&#x27;s poems have attracted an exceptional amount of interest from musicians, and numerous melodies have been based on his poetry by composers such as , , , , , , , , Rachmaninoff, and .

Today, Hugo&#x27;s work continues to stimulate musicians to create new compositions. For example, Hugo&#x27;s novel against capital punishment, &quot;The Last Day of a Condemned Man&quot;, was adapted into an opera by , with a libretto by and premièred by their brother, tenor , in 2007. In Guernsey, every two years, the Victor Hugo International Music Festival attracts a wide range of musicians and the premiere of songs specially commissioned from such composers as , , , and and based on Hugo&#x27;s poetry.

Remarkably, not only has Hugo&#x27;s literary production been the source of inspiration for musical works, but also his political writings have received attention from musicians and have been adapted to music. For instance, in 2009, Italian composer Matteo Sommacal was commissioned by Festival &quot;Bagliori d&#x27;autore&quot; and wrote a piece for speaker and chamber ensemble entitled &quot;Actes et paroles&quot;, with a text elaborated by Chiara Piola Caselli after Victor Hugo&#x27;s last political speech addressed to the Assemblée législative, &quot;Sur la Revision de la Constitution&quot; (18 July 1851), and premiered in Rome on 19 November 2009, in the auditorium of the Institut français, Centre Saint-Louis, French Embassy to the Holy See, by Piccola Accademia degli Specchi featuring the composer .

==Declining years and death==
When Hugo returned to Paris in 1870, the country hailed him as a national hero. He was confident that he would be offered the dictatorship, as shown by the notes he kept at the time: &quot;Dictatorship is a crime. This is a crime I am going to commit,&quot; but he felt he had to assume that responsibility. Despite his popularity, Hugo lost his bid for re-election to the National Assembly in 1872.

Throughout his life Hugo kept believing in unstoppable humanistic progress. In his last public address on 3 August 1879 he prophesied, in an over-optimistic way, &quot;In the twentieth century war will be dead, the scaffold will be dead, hatred will be dead, frontier boundaries will be dead, dogmas will be dead; man will live.&quot;

Within a brief period, he suffered a mild stroke, his daughter Adèle was interned in an insane asylum, and his two sons died. (Adèle&#x27;s biography inspired the movie &quot;The Story of Adele H.&quot;) His wife Adèle had died in 1868.

His faithful mistress, Juliette Drouet, died in 1883, only two years before his own death. Despite his personal loss, Hugo remained committed to the cause of political change. On 30 January 1876, he was elected to the newly created Senate. This last phase of his political career was considered a failure. Hugo was a maverick and achieved little in the Senate. He suffered a mild stroke on 27 June 1878. To honour the fact that he was entering his 80th year, he received one of the greatest tributes to a living writer ever held. The celebrations began on 25 June 1881, when Hugo was presented with a vase, the traditional gift for sovereigns. On 27 June, one of the largest parades in French history was held.

Marchers stretched from the , where the author was living, down the , and all the way to the centre of Paris. The paraders marched for six hours past Hugo as he sat at the window at his house. Every inch and detail of the event was for Hugo; the official guides even wore cornflowers as an allusion to Fantine&#x27;s song in . On 28 June, the city of Paris changed the name of the Avenue d&#x27;Eylau to Avenue Victor-Hugo. Letters addressed to the author were from then on labelled &quot;To Mister Victor Hugo, In his avenue, Paris&quot;. Two days before dying, he left a note with these last words: &quot;To love is to act.&quot;

On 20 May 1885, &quot;le Petit Journal&quot; published the official medical bulletin on Hugo&#x27;s health condition. &quot;The illustrious patient&quot; was fully conscious and aware that there was no hope for him. They also reported from a reliable source that at one point in the night he had whispered the following , &quot;En moi c’est le combat du jour et de la nuit.&quot;—&quot;In me, this is the battle between day and night.&quot; &quot;Le Matin&quot; published a slightly different version: &quot;Here is the battle between day and night.&quot;

Hugo died on May 22, 1885, at 50 Avenue Victor Hugo (now number 124). His death, from pneumonia, generated intense national mourning. He was not only revered as a towering figure in literature, he was a statesman who shaped the Third Republic and democracy in France. All his life he remained a defender of liberty, equality and fraternity as well as an adamant champion of French culture. In 1877, aged 75, he wrote, &quot;I am not one of these sweet-tempered old men. I am still exasperated and violent. I shout and I feel indignant and I cry. Woe to anyone who harms France! I do declare I will die a fanatic patriot.&quot;

Although he had requested a pauper&#x27;s funeral, by decree of President Jules Grévy he was awarded a state funeral, an event described by Nietzsche as a &quot;veritable orgy of bad taste&quot;. More than two million people joined Hugo&#x27;s funeral procession in Paris from the to the , where he was buried. He shares a crypt within the with and . Most large French towns and cities have a street or square named after him.

Hugo left five sentences as his last will, to be officially published:


==Drawings==
Hugo produced more than 4,000 drawings, with about 3,000 drawings still in existence. Originally pursued as a casual hobby, drawing became more important to Hugo shortly before his exile when he made the decision to stop writing to devote himself to politics. Drawing became his exclusive creative outlet between 1848 and 1851.

Hugo worked only on paper, and on a small scale; usually in dark brown or black pen-and-ink wash, sometimes with touches of white, and rarely with colour.

==Personal life==
===Family===
====Marriage====
Hugo married Adèle Foucher in October 1822. Despite their respective affairs, they lived together for nearly 46 years until she died in August 1868. Hugo, who was still banished from France, was unable to attend her funeral in Villequier, where their daughter Léopoldine was buried. From 1830 to 1837, Adèle had an affair with Charles-Augustin Sainte Beuve, a reviewer and writer.

====Children====
Adèle and Victor Hugo had their first child, Léopold, in 1823, but the boy died in infancy. On 28 August 1824, the couple&#x27;s second child, Léopoldine, was born, followed by Charles on 4 November 1826, François-Victor on 28 October 1828, and Adèle on 28 July 1830.

Hugo&#x27;s eldest and favourite daughter, Léopoldine, died in 1843 at the age of 19, shortly after her marriage to Charles Vacquerie. On 4 September, she drowned in the Seine at Villequier when the boat she was in overturned. Her young husband died trying to save her. The death left her father devastated; Hugo was travelling at the time, in the south of France, when he first learned about Léopoldine&#x27;s death from a newspaper that he read in a café.

He describes his shock and grief in his famous poem &quot;À Villequier&quot;:
He wrote many poems afterward about his daughter&#x27;s life and death. His most famous poem is &quot;Demain, dès l&#x27;aube&quot; (Tomorrow, at Dawn), in which he describes visiting her grave.

===Exile===

Hugo decided to live in exile after Napoleon III&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état at the end of 1851. After leaving France, Hugo lived in Brussels briefly in 1851, and then moved to the Channel Islands, first to Jersey (1852–1855) and then to the smaller island of Guernsey in 1855, where he stayed until Napoleon III&#x27;s fall from power in 1870. Although Napoleon III proclaimed a general amnesty in 1859, under which Hugo could have safely returned to France, the author stayed in exile, only returning when Napoleon III was removed from power by the creation of the French Third Republic in 1870, as a result of the French defeat at the Battle of Sedan in the Franco-Prussian War. After the Siege of Paris from 1870 to 1871, Hugo lived again in Guernsey from 1872 to 1873, and then finally returned to France for the remainder of his life. In 1871, after the death of his son Charles, Hugo took custody of his grandchildren Jeanne and Georges-Victor.

===Other relationships===
====Juliette Drouet====

From February 1833 until her death in 1883, Juliette Drouet devoted her whole life to Victor Hugo, who never married her even after his wife died in 1868. He took her on his numerous trips and she followed him in exile on Guernsey. There Hugo rented a house for her near Hauteville House, his family home. She wrote some 20,000 letters in which she expressed her passion or vented her jealousy on her womanizing lover.
On 25 September 1870 during the Siege of Paris (19 September 1870 – 28 January 1871) Hugo feared the worst. He left his children a note reading as follows:

&quot;J.D.
She saved my life in December 1851. For me she underwent exile. Never has her soul forsaken mine. Let those who have loved me love her. Let those who have loved me respect her.
She is my widow.&quot;
V.H.

====Léonie d&#x27;Aunet====
For more than seven years, Léonie d&#x27;Aunet, who was a married woman, was involved in a love relationship with Hugo. Both were caught in adultery on 5 July 1845. Hugo, who had been a Member of the Chamber of Peers since April, avoided condemnation whereas his mistress had to spend two months in prison and six in a convent. Many years after their separation, Hugo made a point of supporting her financially.

====Others====
Hugo gave free rein to his libido until a few weeks before his death. He sought a wide variety of women of all ages, be they courtesans, actresses, prostitutes, admirers, servants or revolutionaries like Louise Michel for sexual activity. Both a graphomaniac and erotomaniac, he systematically reported his casual affairs using his own code, as Samuel Pepys did, to make sure they would remain secret. For instance, he resorted to Latin abbreviations (&quot;osc.&quot; for kisses) or to Spanish (&quot;Misma. Mismas cosas&quot;: The same. Same things). Homophones are frequent: &quot;Seins&quot; (Breasts) becomes Saint; &quot;Poële&quot; (Stove) actually refers to &quot;Poils&quot; (Pubic hair). Analogy also enabled him to conceal the real meaning: A woman&#x27;s &quot;Suisses&quot; (Swiss) are her breasts—because Switzerland is renowned for its milk. After a rendezvous with a young woman named &quot;Laetitia&quot; he would write &quot;Joie&quot; (Happiness) in his diary. If he added &quot;t.n.&quot; (&quot;toute nue&quot;) he meant she stripped naked in front of him. The initials &quot;S.B.&quot; discovered in November 1875 may refer to Sarah Bernhardt.

== Nicknames ==
Victor Hugo acquired several nicknames. The first one originated from his own description of Shakespeare in the introduction to his eponymous work. In this introduction to &quot;William Shakespeare (essay)&quot;, he tried to delve into what constituted the genius of certain artists and described Shakespeare as an &quot;Ocean Man&quot;:There were indeed ocean men.&lt;br&gt;[...] all of this could exist within a mind, and then that mind is called genius, and you have Aeschylus, you have Isaiah, you have Juvenal, you have Dante, you have Michelangelo, you have Shakespeare, and it is the same thing to gaze upon these souls or to gaze upon the Ocean.During his lifetime and in the 1870s, the expression to describe him entered popular culture. It was later adopted by authors and literary critics, including Joseph Serre, who identified it with an expression he himself coined. This nickname became widespread during the 20th century and was used by the National Library of France when organizing an exhibition about him. Since then, it has been frequently used in research and literary critics. Alongside &quot;Ocean Man,&quot; the nickname &quot;Horizon Man&quot; was sometimes used during Hugo&#x27;s lifetime as well. Finally, researchers and literary critics, such as Henri Meschonnic, proposed the nickname &quot;Century Man&quot; to refer to Victor Hugo.

<text>Midnight Cowboy is a 1969 American drama film directed by John Schlesinger, adapted by Waldo Salt from the 1965 novel by James Leo Herlihy. The film stars Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight, with supporting roles played by Sylvia Miles, John McGiver, Brenda Vaccaro, Bob Balaban, Jennifer Salt and Barnard Hughes. Set in New York City, &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; depicts the unlikely friendship between two hustlers: naïve prostitute Joe Buck (Voight) and ailing con man Rico Rizzo (Hoffman), referred to as &quot;Ratso&quot;.

At the 42nd Academy Awards, the film won three awards: Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; is the only X-rated film (equivalent of the current NC-17 rating) to win Best Picture. It placed 36th on the American Film Institute&#x27;s 1998 list of the 100 greatest American films of all time, and 43rd on its 2007 updated version. &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; is often seen as one of the greatest films of the 60s.

In 1994, &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress, and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

==Plot==

Young Texan Joe Buck quits his dishwashing job, and heads by bus to New York City in cowboy attire to become a male prostitute. Initially unsuccessful, he finally beds a middle-aged woman, Cass, in her Park Avenue apartment. She is insulted when he requests payment, and Joe ultimately gives money to her.

Joe meets Rico &quot;Ratso&quot; Rizzo, an indigent con man with a limp who takes $20 for introducing him to a pimp. After discovering that the alleged pimp is actually an unhinged religious fanatic, Joe flees and unsuccessfully searches for Rico. Joe spends his days wandering the city, listening to his Zenith portable radio and sitting in his hotel room. When his money runs out, management locks Joe out and impounds his belongings.

In an attempt to make money, Joe receives oral sex from a meek young man in a movie theater, but the man cannot pay. Joe threatens him, but releases him unharmed. The next day, Joe spots Rico at a diner, and angrily confronts him. Rico manages to calm Joe, and invites him to share his squalid, condemned apartment squat. Joe reluctantly accepts, and the two begin a &quot;business relationship&quot; as hustlers. Rico asks Joe to call him &quot;Rico&quot; instead of &quot;Ratso&quot;, but Joe does not oblige. They struggle with severe poverty, stealing food and failing to get work for Joe. Joe pawns his radio and sells his blood, while Rico&#x27;s persistent cough worsens during a winter without heat in the freezing apartment.

In intermittent flashbacks, Joe&#x27;s grandmother raises him after his mother abandons him. He has a tragic relationship with Annie, disclosed through hazy flashbacks in which they are attacked and raped by a cowboy gang. Annie shows signs of mental trauma and is taken into an ambulance.

Rico tells Joe his father was an illiterate Italian immigrant shoeshiner whose job yielded a bad back and lung damage from inhaling shoe polish. Rico learned shoeshining from his father, but considers it degrading and generally refuses to do it. When he breaks into a stand and shines Joe&#x27;s cowboy boots to attract clients, two police officers arrive and sit with their dirty boots next to Joe&#x27;s. Rico dreams of escaping to Miami, shown in fantasies in which he and Joe frolic on a beach and are pampered at a resort, including a boy polishing Rico&#x27;s boots.

A Warhol-like filmmaker and an extrovert female artist approach Joe in a diner, taking his photograph and inviting him to a Warhol-esque art event. Joe and Rico attend, but Rico&#x27;s poor health and hygiene attract unwanted attention. After mistaking a joint for a cigarette and receiving uppers, Joe hallucinates. He leaves with Shirley, a socialite who pays him $20 for spending the night, but Joe cannot perform sexually. They play Scribbage, and the resulting wordplay leads Shirley to suggest that Joe may be gay; suddenly, he is able to perform. The next morning, she sets up her female friend as Joe&#x27;s client, and at last his career appears to be progressing.

When Joe returns to the apartment, Rico is severely feverish. He refuses medical help, and begs Joe to put him on a bus to Florida. Desperate for cash, Joe picks up an effeminate middle-aged man in an arcade. The two return to the man&#x27;s hotel room, where Joe demands money. However, when the man refuses to give him more than $10, Joe brutally beats, robs, and apparently smothers him. Joe buys two bus tickets to Florida with the stolen cash. Rico again tells Joe that he wants to be called &quot;Rico&quot;, not &quot;Ratso&quot;, and Joe finally begins to oblige. During the bus trip, Rico&#x27;s health worsens, and he suffers from urinary incontinence.

Joe buys new clothing for Rico and himself at a rest stop, discarding his cowboy outfit and boots. Back on the bus, Joe muses that there must be an easier way to make money than hustling, and tells Rico that he will get a regular job in Miami. When he does not respond, Joe realizes that Rico has died. Joe alerts the bus driver, who asks Joe to close Rico&#x27;s eyelids, saying that they will soon be in Miami. The other passengers stare. With tears in his eyes, Joe sits with his arm around his dead friend as the bus continues past rows of Floridian palm trees.

==Production==
The opening scenes were filmed in Big Spring, Texas, in 1968. A roadside billboard, stating, &quot;If you don&#x27;t have an oil well...get one!&quot;, was shown as the New York-bound bus carrying Joe Buck rolled through Texas. Such advertisements, common in the Southwestern United States in the late 1960s and through the 1970s, promoted Eddie Chiles&#x27; Western Company of North America.

In the film, Joe stays at the Hotel Claridge, at the southeast corner of Broadway and West 44th Street in Midtown Manhattan. His room overlooked the northern half of Times Square. The building, designed by D. H. Burnham &amp; Company and opened in 1911, was demolished in 1972. A motif featured three times throughout the New York scenes was the sign atop of the facade of the Mutual of New York (MONY) Building at 1740 Broadway. It was extended into the &quot;Scribbage&quot; scene with Shirley the socialite, when Joe&#x27;s incorrect spelling of the word &quot;money&quot; matched that of the sign.

Dustin Hoffman, who played a grizzled veteran of New York&#x27;s streets, is from Los Angeles. Despite his portrayal of Joe Buck, a character hopelessly out of his element in New York, Jon Voight is a native New Yorker, hailing from Yonkers. Voight was paid &quot;scale&quot; (the Screen Actors Guild minimum wage) for his portrayal of Joe Buck, a concession he willingly made to obtain the part. Harrison Ford auditioned for the role of Joe Buck. Michael Sarrazin, who was Schlesinger&#x27;s first choice, was cast as Joe Buck, only to be fired when unable to gain release from his contract with Universal.

The line, &quot;I&#x27;m walkin&#x27; here!&quot;, which reached number 27 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes, is subject to differing accounts. Producer Jerome Hellman disputes the notion that it was an ad-lib on the two-disc DVD set of &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;. The scene, which originally had Ratso pretend to be hit by a taxi to feign an injury, is written into the first draft of the original script. Hoffman, however, on an installment of Bravo&#x27;s &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, stated that there were many takes, with the actors hoping to get to the crosswalk at a red light so as not to have to wait for traffic while talking. In that take, they were able to cross the road without waiting, but a cab unexpectedly ran the red light and nearly hit them. Hoffman wanted to say, &quot;We&#x27;re doing a movie here!&quot; and can be heard beginning to say as such in the final film, but he ultimately changed his sentence halfway and stayed in character as he berated the driver. As such, the latter&#x27;s angry response is also unscripted.

On initial review by the Motion Picture Association of America, &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; received an &quot;R&quot; (&quot;Restricted&quot;) rating. However, after consulting with a psychologist, executives at United Artists were told to accept an &quot;X&quot; rating, due to the &quot;homosexual frame of reference&quot; and its &quot;possible influence on youngsters&quot;. The film was released with an X rating. The MPAA later broadened the requirements for the &quot;R&quot; rating to allow more content, and raised the age restriction from 14 to 17. The film was later rated &quot;R&quot; for a reissue in 1971.

It took several hours to shoot the rape scene, and Jennifer Salt recalls the evening as a traumatic ordeal for her. The wardrobe crew had given Jennifer a nude-colored body suit to wear, but the night was so hot and sticky that she quickly stripped it off. &quot;I felt that the most horrible thing in the world was that people were seeing my bare ass, and that was so humiliating I could not even discuss it. And this kid was just on top of me and all over me and it hurt and no one gave a fuck and it was supposed to look like I was being raped. And I was screaming, screaming, and it was traumatic in some way that couldn&#x27;t be acknowledged.&quot;

==Reception==
Critical response to the film has been largely positive. Vincent Canby&#x27;s lengthy 1969 review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; was blunt: &quot;a slick, brutal (but not brutalizing) movie version of... Herlihy&#x27;s 1965 novel. It is tough and good in important ways, although its style is oddly romantic and at variance with the laconic material... As long as the focus is on this world of cafeterias and abandoned tenements, of desperate conjunctions in movie balconies and doorways, of ketchup and beans and canned heat, &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; is so rough and vivid that it&#x27;s almost unbearable... &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; often seems to be exploiting its material for sensational or comic effect, but it is ultimately a moving experience that captures the quality of a time and a place. It&#x27;s not a movie for the ages, but, having seen it, you won&#x27;t ever again feel detached as you walk down West 42nd Street, avoiding the eyes of the drifters, stepping around the little islands of hustlers and closing your nostrils to the smell of rancid griddles.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said of the film: &quot;I cannot recall a more marvelous pair of acting performances in any one film.&quot;

In a 25th-anniversary retrospective in 1994, Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;″s peep-show vision of Manhattan lowlife may no longer be shocking, but what is shocking, in 1994, is to see a major studio film linger this lovingly on characters who have nothing to offer the audience but their own lost souls.&quot;

As of 2022, &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; holds an 89% approval rating on online review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.50/10, based on 116 reviews. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;John Schlesinger&#x27;s gritty, unrelentingly bleak look at the seedy underbelly of urban American life is undeniably disturbing, but Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight&#x27;s performances make it difficult to turn away.&quot;

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited this movie as one of his 100 favorite films.

===Box office===
The film opened at the Coronet Theatre in New York City, and grossed a house record $61,503 in its first week. In its tenth week of release, the film became number one in the United States, with a weekly gross of $550,237, and was the highest-grossing movie in September 1969. The film earned $11 million in rentals in the United States and Canada in 1969, and added a further $5.3 million the following year when it won the Academy Award for Best Picture. It eventually earned rentals of $20.5 million in the United States and Canada. By 1975, it had earned rentals of over $30 million worldwide.

===Television premiere===
More than five years after its theatrical release, &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; premiered on television November 3, 1974. Twenty-five minutes were edited from the film due to censorship regulations and a desire for broader appeal. Although the cuts were approved by director John Schlesinger, critic Kay Gardella of the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; said the film was &quot;hacked up pretty badly&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Soundtrack==
John Barry composed the score, winning a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Theme, although he did not receive an on-screen credit. Fred Neil&#x27;s song, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talkin&quot;, won a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male for Harry Nilsson. Schlesinger chose the song as its theme, and the song underscores the first act. Other songs considered for the theme included Nilsson&#x27;s own &quot;I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City&quot; and Randy Newman&#x27;s &quot;Cowboy&quot;. Bob Dylan wrote &quot;Lay Lady Lay&quot; to serve as the theme song, but did not finish it in time. The movie&#x27;s main theme, &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, features harmonica by Toots Thielemans, but the album version is played by Tommy Reilly. The soundtrack album was released by United Artists Records in 1969.

===Track listing===

<doc id="42148" wikidata="Q42930" url="?curid=42148" title="Dustin Hoffman">
<text>Dustin Lee Hoffman (born August 8, 1937) is an American actor. As one of the key actors in the formation of New Hollywood, Hoffman is known for his versatile portrayals of antiheroes and emotionally vulnerable characters. Among his numerous accolades are two Academy Awards, four BAFTA Awards, five Golden Globe Awards, and two Primetime Emmy Awards as well as a nomination for a Tony Award. He was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1997, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1999, and the Kennedy Center Honors Award in 2012. 

Hoffman studied at the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music before he decided to go into acting, for which he trained at the Pasadena Playhouse. He made his film debut with the black comedy &quot;The Tiger Makes Out&quot; (1967). He went on to receive two Academy Awards for Best Actor playing a man going through a divorce in &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; (1979) and an autistic savant in &quot;Rain Man&quot; (1988). He was Oscar-nominated for &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967), &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (1969), &quot;Lenny&quot; (1974), &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982), and &quot;Wag the Dog&quot; (1997). Other notable roles include in &quot;Little Big Man&quot; (1970), &quot;Papillon&quot; (1973), &quot;Marathon Man&quot; (1976), &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1976), &quot;Ishtar&quot; (1987), &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (1990), and &quot;Hook&quot; (1991).

In the 21st century, he acted in films such &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; (2004), &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; (2004), and &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot; (2006), as well as &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot; (2004) and the sequel &quot;Little Fockers&quot; (2010) &quot;The Meyerowitz Stories&quot; (2017), and &quot;Megalopolis&quot; (2024). Hoffman has voiced roles in &quot;The Tale of Despereaux&quot; (2008) and the &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot; film series (2008–2024). In 2012, he made his directorial debut with &quot;Quartet&quot;.

Hoffman made his Broadway debut in the 1961 play &quot;A Cook for Mr. General&quot;. He subsequently starred as Willy Loman in the 1984 revival of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; and reprised the role a year later in a television film, earning a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Actor in a Limited Series or Movie. In 1989, he received a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play nomination for his role as Shylock in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. He has received three Drama Desk Awards, for his performances in &quot;Eh?&quot; (1967), &quot;Jimmy Shine&quot; (1969), and &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; (1984), respectively.

==Early life and education ==
Dustin Lee Hoffman was born on August 8, 1937, in Los Angeles, California, the younger of two sons of Harry Hoffman (1902–1987) and Lillian (née Gold; 1907–1982). His father worked as a prop supervisor (set decorator) at Columbia Pictures before becoming a furniture salesman.

Hoffman was named after stage and silent screen actor Dustin Farnum. He has an elder brother Ronald, who is a lawyer and economist. Hoffman is Jewish, from an Ashkenazi Jewish family of immigrants from Kyiv, Ukraine (then a part of the Russian Empire), and Iași, Romania. The family&#x27;s surname was spelled Гойхман (&quot;Goikhman&quot;) in the Russian Empire.

His upbringing was nonreligious, and he has said, &quot;I don&#x27;t have any memory of celebrating holidays growing up that were Jewish&quot;, and that he had &quot;realized&quot; he was Jewish at around the age of 10.

Hoffman graduated from Los Angeles High School in 1955 and enrolled at Santa Monica College with the intention of studying medicine. But he decided to become an actor, and left in the following year to join the Pasadena Playhouse, although when he told his family about his career goal, his Aunt Pearl warned him, &quot;You can&#x27;t be an actor. You are not good-looking enough.&quot; He also studied with Lee Strasberg and has stated that he did not study with either Sanford Meisner or Stella Adler.

Hoffman initially hoped to become a classical pianist, having studied piano during much of his youth and in college. While at Santa Monica College, he also took an acting class, which he assumed would be easy, and &quot;caught the acting bug&quot;. He recalls: &quot;I just was not gifted in music. I did not have an ear.&quot; Now an aspiring actor, he spent the next 10 years doing odd jobs, being unemployed, and struggling to get any available acting roles, a lifestyle he was later to portray in the comedy film &quot;Tootsie&quot;. Hoffman composed a song called &quot;Shooting the Breeze&quot;, alongside Bette Midler who wrote the words.

== Film career==

===1960–1966: Early theatre roles ===
Hoffman&#x27;s first acting role was at the Pasadena Playhouse, alongside future Academy Award–winner Gene Hackman. After two years there, Hackman headed for New York City, with Hoffman soon following. Hoffman, Hackman, and Robert Duvall lived together in the 1960s, whilst all three of them focused on finding acting jobs. Hackman remembers, &quot;The idea that any of us would do well in films simply didn&#x27;t occur to us. We just wanted to work&quot;. Hoffman&#x27;s appearance—Duvall described him as Barbra Streisand in drag—and small size made him uncastable, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; later wrote. During this period, Hoffman got occasional television bit parts, including commercials but, needing income, he briefly left acting in order to teach.

Hoffman then studied at Actors Studio and became a dedicated method actor. In 1960 Hoffman was cast in a role in an off-Broadway production and followed with a bit part in his Broadway debut in production, &quot;A Cook for Mr. General&quot; (1961). In 1962, he appeared in Rabbit Run Theatre&#x27;s summer stock production of &quot;Write Me a Murder&quot; in Madison, Ohio and served as an assistant director to Ulu Grosbard on &quot;The Days and Nights of Beebee Fenstermaker&quot; at off-Broadway&#x27;s Sheridan Square Playhouse. In 1964, Hoffman appeared in &quot;Three Men on a Horse&quot; at Princeton&#x27;s McCarter Theatre and in 1965, in off-Broadway&#x27;s &quot;Harry, Noon and Night&quot; with Joel Grey. On June 23, 1965, he played Mendy in a practice run of Philip Roth&#x27;s abandoned off-Broadway play &quot;The Nice Jewish Boy&quot;, directed by Gene Saks and co-starring Melinda Dillon. Grosbard and Hoffman reunited for a 1965 recording of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; starring Lee J. Cobb and Mildred Dunnock, with Hoffman playing Bernard. He was assistant director for Grosbard&#x27;s 1965 off-Broadway production of &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; starring Robert Duvall and Jon Voight, and in late 1965 stage-managed and appeared in Grosbard&#x27;s &quot;The Subject Was Roses&quot; on Broadway. Hoffman&#x27;s &quot;sharply outlined and vividly colored&quot; performance in off-Broadway&#x27;s &quot;The Journey of the Fifth Horse&quot; in April 1966 was followed by another critical success in the play &quot;Eh?&quot;, by Henry Livings, which had its U.S. premiere at the Circle in the Square Theatre on October 16, 1966. Sidney W. Pink, a producer and 3D-movie pioneer, discovered Hoffman in one of his off-Broadway roles and cast him in &quot;Madigan&#x27;s Millions&quot;. Through the early and mid-1960s, Hoffman made appearances in television shows and movies, including &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot; and &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;.

Hoffman starred in the 1966 off-Broadway play &quot;Eh?&quot;, for which he received a Drama Desk Award. He made his film debut in &quot;The Tiger Makes Out&quot; in 1967, alongside Eli Wallach. In 1967, immediately after wrapping up principal filming on &quot;The Tiger Makes Out&quot;, Hoffman flew from New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, where he directed productions of William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Two for the Seesaw&quot; and William Saroyan&#x27;s &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot; for the Fargo-Moorhead Community Theatre. The $1,000 he received for the eight-week contract was all he had to hold him over until the funds from the movie materialized.

=== 1967–1969: &quot;The Graduate&quot; and breakthrough ===

Director Mike Nichols auditioned Hoffman in 1966 for a lead role in the Broadway musical &quot;The Apple Tree&quot; but rejected him because he could not sing well enough, and gave Alan Alda the part. However, Nichols was so impressed with Hoffman&#x27;s overall audition that he cast him as the male lead in the movie &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967). This role was that of Benjamin Braddock, a recent college graduate who has an affair with Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father&#x27;s law partner. It was Hoffman&#x27;s first major role; he received an Academy Award nomination for it, but lost to Rod Steiger for &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;.

Although &quot;Life&quot; magazine joked that &quot;if Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s face were his fortune, he&#x27;d be committed to a life of poverty&quot;, &quot;The Graduate&quot; was a gigantic box office hit for Embassy Pictures, making Hoffman a major new star at the same time. The film received near-unanimous good reviews. &quot;Time&quot; magazine called Hoffman &quot;a symbol of youth&quot; who represented &quot;a new breed of actors&quot;. The film&#x27;s screenwriter, Buck Henry, notes that Hoffman&#x27;s character made conventional good looks no longer necessary on screen, &quot;A whole generation changed its idea of what guys should look like. ... I think Dustin&#x27;s physical being brought a sort of social and visual change, in the same way people first thought of Bogart. They called &quot;him&quot; ugly&quot;. Hoffman&#x27;s success amazed friends from his early years as an actor, who told him &quot;You were the last one I expected to make it&quot;. Biographer Jeff Lenburg wrote that &quot;newspapers across the country were deluged with thousands of letters from fans&quot;, with one example published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;I identified with Ben. ... I thought of him as a spiritual brother. He was confused about his future and about his place in the world, as I am. It&#x27;s a film one digs, rather than understands intellectually&quot;.

&quot;Turner Classic Movies&quot; critic Rob Nixon notes that Hoffman represented &quot;a new generation of actors&quot;. He credits Hoffman with breaking &quot;the mold of the traditional movie star and brought to their roles a new candor, ethnicity, and eagerness to dive deep into complex, even unlikable characters.&quot; Nixon expands on the significance of the film to Hoffman&#x27;s career: &quot;In &quot;The Graduate&quot;, he created a lasting resonance as Ben Braddock that made him an overnight sensation and set him on the road to becoming one of our biggest stars and most respected actors.&quot; Hoffman, however, mostly credits director Mike Nichols for taking a great risk in giving him, a relative unknown, the starring role: &quot;I don&#x27;t know of another instance of a director at the height of his powers who would take a chance and cast someone like me in that part. It took tremendous courage.&quot;

Critic Sam Kashner observed strong similarities between Hoffman&#x27;s character and that of Nichols when he previously acted with Elaine May in the comedy team of Nichols and May. &quot;Just close your eyes and you&#x27;ll hear a Mike Nichols—Elaine May routine in any number of scenes.&quot; Buck Henry also noticed that &quot;Dustin picked up all these Nichols habits, which he used in the character. Those little noises he makes are straight from Mike&quot;, he says. After completing &quot;The Graduate&quot; Hoffman turned down most of the film roles offered to him, preferring to go back to New York and continue performing in live theater. He returned to Broadway to appear in the title role of the musical &quot;Jimmy Shine&quot;. Hoffman won a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance.&quot;I was a theater person. That&#x27;s how my friends were, too, Gene Hackman and Bobby Duvall. I wasn&#x27;t going to be a movie star. I wasn&#x27;t going to sell out. We wanted to be really good actors. I told them, &quot;I&#x27;m going out to make this movie. Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m coming right back.&quot;

Hoffman was paid $20,000 for his role in &quot;The Graduate&quot;, but netted just $4,000 after taxes and living expenses. After spending that money, Hoffman filed for New York State unemployment benefits, receiving $55 per week while living in a two-room apartment in the West Village of Manhattan. He was then offered the lead in &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (1969), which he accepted partly to prove many critics were wrong about his acting range and the variety of characters he could portray. Peter Biskind wrote, &quot;it was the very contrast between his preppy character in &quot;The Graduate&quot;, and Ratso Rizzo&quot; that appealed to Hoffman. &#x27;I had become troubled,&#x27; recalls Hoffman, &#x27;by the reviews that I read of &quot;The Graduate&quot;, that I was not a character actor, which I like to think of myself as. It hurt me. Some of the stuff in the press was brutal.&#x27;&quot; Critics assumed that director Mike Nichols got lucky by finding a typical actor with average acting ability to play the part of Benjamin Braddock.
John Schlesinger, who would direct &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; and was seeking lead actors, held that same impression. Hoffman&#x27;s performance as a button-down college graduate and track star was so convincing to Schlesinger, &quot;he seemed unable to comprehend the fact that he was acting&quot;, notes Biskind. To help the director, whom he had never met, overcome that false impression, Hoffman met him in Times Square dressed as a homeless person, wearing a dirty raincoat, his hair slicked back and with an unshaven face. Schlesinger was sold, admitting, &quot;I&#x27;ve only seen you in the context of &quot;The Graduate&quot;, but you&#x27;ll do quite well.&quot; &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; premiered in theaters across the United States in May 1969. For his acting, Hoffman received his second Oscar nomination and the film won Best Picture. In 1994 the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. Biskind considers Hoffman&#x27;s acting a major accomplishment:

Also in 1969, Hoffman co-starred with Mia Farrow in the Peter Yates&#x27;s romantic drama film &quot;John and Mary&quot;. He received a 1970 British Academy Film Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film, although the film received mixed reviews. He was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy Motion Picture The film was made soon after the success of Farrow&#x27;s performance in Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1968), and Hoffman&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Graduate&quot;, which prompted their being hailed on the cover of the February 27, 1969, &quot;Time&quot; magazine as stars of their generation.

=== 1970–1979: Film stardom and acclaim ===
This was followed by his role in &quot;Little Big Man&quot; (1970), where Jack Crabb, his character, ages from teenager to a 121-year-old man. The film was widely praised by critics, but was overlooked for an award except for a supporting nomination for Chief Dan George. Hoffman continued to appear in major films over the next few years. &quot;Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?&quot; (1971), &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; (also 1971), and &quot;Papillon&quot; (1973). He returned to Broadway in 1974, directing &quot;All Over Town&quot;. Hoffman next starred in &quot;Lenny&quot; (1974), for which he was again nominated for Best Actor. &quot;Lenny&quot; was based on the life of stand-up comedian Lenny Bruce, who died at the age of 40, and was known for his open, free-style and critical form of comedy which integrated politics, religion, sex, and vulgarity. Expectations were high that Hoffman would win an Oscar for his portrayal, especially after his similar role in &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;. Film critic Katharine Lowry speculates that director Bob Fosse &quot;never gave him a chance&quot; to go far enough into developing the character. &quot;We never understand what, besides the drugs he injected, made him tick like a time bomb&quot;, she says.
However, notes author Paul Gardner, &quot;directing &quot;Lenny&quot;, his most ambitious project, exhausted Fosse emotionally and physically. It turned his life inside out&quot;, with shooting days often lasting 10 to 12 hours: &quot;The Lenny Bruce project, based on Julian Barry&#x27;s play, had gone through two studios and three scripts, and was a problem child, like Lenny himself. But Fosse wanted to do it, and he wanted Dustin Hoffman&quot;. Hoffman initially turned the part down, saying: &quot;I didn&#x27;t think the script was strong enough and I wasn&#x27;t sure I was the one to play the role.&quot; While considering the part, he read Lenny Bruce&#x27;s autobiography and looked at films with Bruce performing stand-up to live audiences. In the same interview with &quot;Playboy&quot; he recounted: &quot;I began to feel an affinity with him, a realization that there was a lot of Lenny Bruce in me. My wife felt it too ... I realized that I&#x27;d have to make use of my own spontaneity because he was so spontaneous. And I admired his guts ... That intimacy is what an actor tries to get ... It occurred to me that if I had known him, I would have wanted us to be friends ... and he was a provocateur, and I love to provoke.&quot; Movie critic Judith Crist gave Hoffman credit for the ultimate success of the film:

&quot;Lenny&quot; was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Cinematography.

&quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1976) was made less than two years after the Watergate scandal, and starred Hoffman and Robert Redford as the real-life journalists, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, respectively. Based on actual events, Hoffman and Redford play &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporters who uncover a break-in at the Watergate Hotel and end up investigating a political scandal that reaches all the way to the presidency. The film, as earlier ones, had Hoffman take on a dramatically different character than his previous one (as Lenny Bruce), although both men, Bruce and Bernstein, set their faces against abuses of institutional power, and the tendency for society to ignore such abuses. Author James Morrison compares the two roles: &quot;As Lenny Bruce in &quot;Lenny&quot; (1974), Hoffman plays a martyr to the cause of establishment oppression, while in &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, he plays a reporter exposing presidential malfeasance.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as &quot;a spellbinding detective story&quot;. &quot;The strength of the movie&quot;, he added, was &quot;the virtually day-to-day record of the way Bernstein and Woodward conducted their investigations.&quot; The characters portrayed by Hoffman and Redford shared the rank of No. 27 Hero on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains list, while &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; as one of the 25 &quot;Powerful Political Thrillers&quot;.

Hoffman next starred in &quot;Marathon Man&quot; (1976), a film based on William Goldman&#x27;s novel of the same name, opposite Laurence Olivier and Roy Scheider. Its director, John Schlesinger also directed Hoffman in &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; in 1969. Described as &quot;Schlesinger&#x27;s thriller&quot;, by author Gene D. Phillips, Hoffman plays the hero, Babe Levy, a part-time long-distance runner and graduate student, who suddenly finds himself being pursued by a fugitive Nazi. To put himself in the mindset of someone under severe emotional distress, Hoffman did not sleep for days at a time and let his body become disheveled and unhealthy. Olivier was alarmed when Hoffman turned up on set for the dental torture scene. Hoffman explained what he had done, and Olivier replied: &quot;Dear boy! Next time try acting. It&#x27;s much easier.&quot;

Goldman describes his inspiration for the novel: &quot;What if someone close to you was something totally different from what you thought? In the story, Hoffman thinks his brother (Roy Scheider) is a businessman where the reality is that the man is a spy, who has been involved with the Nazi, Szell.&quot; However, Hoffman remembers a serious disagreement he had with Goldman, who also wrote the screenplay, about how the story ends:

Hoffman&#x27;s next roles were also successful. He opted out of directing &quot;Straight Time&quot; (1978), but starred as a thief. His next film, Michael Apted&#x27;s &quot;Agatha&quot; (1979), was with Vanessa Redgrave as Agatha Christie, focussing on the missing eleven days of the author&#x27;s life. The part of Archie Christie was played by Timothy Dalton, then partner of Vanessa Redgrave, and later to star in James Bond movies. Dalton&#x27;s depiction of cold indifference to his wife produced a perfect foil to Hoffman&#x27;s portrayal of warm compassion, humor and sensitivity. The film had both romantic and comic moments whilst the overall plot cleverly mirrored one of Christie&#x27;s detective novels. &quot;Agatha&quot; was generally very well received by critics, especially in the UK, and maintains an 82% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Hoffman next starred in &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; (1979) co-starring Meryl Streep and directed by Robert Benton. The film tells the story of a married couple&#x27;s divorce and its impact on everyone involved, including the couple&#x27;s young son. Hoffman won his first Academy Award, and the film also received the Best Picture honor, plus the awards for Best Supporting Actress (Streep), Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. The film required Hoffman to change his attitude, from being a &quot;desensitized advertising art director&quot; into becoming a &quot;responsive and concerned daddy&quot; after his wife (Streep) walks out on him and their six-year-old son, Billy. Hoffman, during the making of the movie, was also going through his own divorce after a ten-year first marriage. Hoffman has said, &quot;Giving myself permission not only to be present but to be a father was a kind of epiphany for me at that time, that I could get to through my work. ... I got closer to being a father by playing a father. That&#x27;s very painful to say.&quot; The role also reminded him of his own love of children in general saying, &quot;Children are more interesting than anything. I walk my younger child to school every day and I don&#x27;t like leaving the school. I would like to sit down on those little chairs, at those little tables, and play. And a child&#x27;s love is like a drug. To have a child throw his arms about you—it&#x27;s instant stoned. People talk about the rush heroin gives you: I would say children give you that rush&quot;.

Benton&#x27;s directing has been praised by Hoffman, who credits him for inspiring the emotional level supporting many scenes: &quot;Perfect directors make you emotional. On &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot;, Robert Benton made me emotional. He was pulling so hard for me. When I didn&#x27;t think I could do a scene again I&#x27;d say, &quot;I can&#x27;t give it to you, I haven&#x27;t got it.&quot; Then he&#x27;d just get this look on his face and roll the camera and I&#x27;d say, &quot;Okay, this is yours.&quot; That&#x27;s what he made you want to do for him—to give him one.&quot;

=== 1980–1989: Career expansion ===

In &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982), Hoffman portrays Michael Dorsey, a struggling actor who finds himself dressing up as a woman to land a role on a soap opera. His co-star was Jessica Lange. &quot;Tootsie&quot; earned ten Academy Award nominations, including Hoffman&#x27;s fifth nomination. Under direction by Sydney Pollack, Hoffman&#x27;s role demanded &quot;a steady bombardment of opposites—edgy then funny, romantic then realistic, soft then quivering.&quot; To film critic David Denby, Hoffman&#x27;s character &quot;embodies vulnerability and drive in perfect proportion. He has the knack of making everything he does seem perilous, and so audiences feel protective of him and root for him.&quot; Hoffman&#x27;s acting was made more difficult than necessary, however, as he was not given the rehearsal time Pollack promised, &quot;I like to be very prepared, and I feel that the success or failure of a film is many times determined before you start principal photography. I wanted rehearsal very much. I was promised two weeks and was grieved that I didn&#x27;t get it. We also followed the risky course of starting to shoot with a screenplay that wasn&#x27;t completed&quot;.

Fellow actor Gary Oldman reported that, during a telephone conversation with Hoffman, the latter recalled having made comments toward a &quot;very powerful&quot; industry figure who ensured that he was unable to find work in Hollywood for some time following &quot;Tootsie&quot;. In 1983, Hoffman became a Major Donor for The Mirror Theater Ltd, alongside Paul Newman and Al Pacino, matching a grant from Laurance Rockefeller. The men were inspired to invest by their connection with Lee Strasberg, as Lee&#x27;s then daughter-in-law Sabra Jones was the Founder and Producing Artistic Director of The Mirror.
In 1983, Hoffman signed on to star in &quot;The Yellow Jersey&quot;, which was to be a bicycle-racing drama set during the Tour de France. Hoffman was passionate about the project, considering several directors, firstly Michael Cimino whom he later fired due to the director&#x27;s uncompromising way of working. The film&#x27;s producers, however, failed to find a suitable replacement, so the film was not made.

In 1984, Hoffman starred as Willy Loman in the Broadway revival of Arthur Miller&#x27;s play &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;. He reprised his role in a TV movie of the same name, for which he won the 1985 Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor along with a Golden Globe. Hoffman first read the play at the age of 16, but today considers the story much like his own: &quot;It was a blueprint of my family. I was the loser, the flunky, and my brother, a high-school varsity football player, was Biff.&quot; Author Marie Brenner notes that Hoffman &quot;has been obsessed with the play&quot; throughout his career: &quot;For years he has wanted to be Willy Loman; when he discovered that Arthur Miller was his neighbor in Connecticut, they began to talk about it in earnest.&quot; For Hoffman, the story also left a deep emotional impact from the time he first read it, &quot;I read that play, and I was just destroyed by it. It was like finding out something terrible about my family. I just shook. I felt like my family&#x27;s privacy had been invaded. I couldn&#x27;t even talk about it for weeks&quot;. Hoffman rehearsed for three weeks with the play&#x27;s original star, Lee J. Cobb, and remembers seeing his stage performance: &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget that period in my life. It was so vivid, so intense, watching Lee J. Cobb and his sixteen-inch guns as Willy. God, how I think about what I saw on that stage!&quot; Brenner adds that Hoffman &quot;has been training like a boxer for the role that so exhausted Cobb he had to be replaced after four months.&quot; The original play was directed by Elia Kazan, who Hoffman considers &quot;the perfect director, the best there ever was. ... God, I would have done &quot;anything&quot; to have worked with Kazan.&quot;

Hoffman&#x27;s worst film failure was Elaine May&#x27;s &quot;Ishtar&quot; (1987), co-starring Warren Beatty, who also produced it. Hoffman and Beatty play two down-and-out singer-songwriters who travel to Morocco for a nightclub gig and get caught up in foreign intrigue. Much of the movie was filmed in Africa. The film faced severe production problems, mostly related to its $55 million cost, and received overwhelmingly negative reviews. However, Hoffman and Beatty liked the film&#x27;s final cut and tried to defend it. Hoffman and Beatty were unaffected by the flop, and &quot;Ishtar&quot; became a cult film. Quentin Tarantino, for one, has called it one of his favorite movies, partly due to the humorous lyrics of the songs written by Paul Williams. Hoffman describes why he loves the film:

Next came director Barry Levinson&#x27;s &quot;Rain Man&quot; (1988), where Hoffman starred as an autistic savant, opposite Tom Cruise. Levinson, Hoffman and Cruise worked for two years on the film, and Hoffman&#x27;s performance gained him his second Academy Award. Behind Hoffman&#x27;s motivation for doing the film, he has said, &quot;Deep inside, &quot;Rain Man&quot; is about how autistic we all are.&quot; In preparation for the part, Hoffman spent two years befriending autistic people, which included taking them bowling and to fast food restaurants. &quot;It fed my obsession&quot;, he has stated. Hoffman worked at the New York Psychiatric Institute, affiliated with Columbia University, when he was 21. &quot;It was a great experience for me&quot;, he said. &quot;All my life I had wanted to get inside a prison or a mental hospital. ... I wanted to get inside where behavior, human behavior, was so exposed. All the things the rest of us were feeling and stopping up were coming out of these people.&quot; He used that experience to help him develop the character of Raymond Babbitt, a high-functioning autistic savant, yet a person who critic David Denby described as &quot;a strangely shuttered genius&quot;. Hoffman created certain character traits for Raymond. Denby noted: &quot;Hoffman, looking suddenly older and smaller, has developed a small shuffling walk for Raymond, with shoulder bent. His eyes don&#x27;t make contact with anyone else&#x27;s, and he flattens his voice to a dry nasal bark.&quot;
&quot;Rain Man&quot; won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Hoffman, and Best Director for Barry Levinson. Having worked closely with Hoffman for two years on filming, Levinson offered some opinions about his skill as an actor:

After &quot;Rain Man&quot;, Hoffman appeared with Sean Connery and Matthew Broderick in &quot;Family Business&quot; (1989), directed by Sidney Lumet. The story centers on the estrangement between Vito (Hoffman), a middle-aged man trying to succeed in a legitimate business, and his &quot;hopelessly corrupt but charming father&quot;, Jesse (Connery). Critics were mostly not impressed with the story, although the individual performances were praised, especially Connery&#x27;s.

Because of their different acting styles and nationalities, some industry writers thought Connery and Hoffman might not work well together as close family members. &quot;To the surprise of many&quot;, note Connery biographers Lee Pfeiffer and Lisa Philip, &quot;the two superstars developed an immediate rapport and chemistry that translates onto the screen.&quot; And Lumet remembered: &quot;Sean is extremely disciplined and Dustin is very improvisational, all over the place with his lines. I didn&#x27;t know where it would end up, but Sean met Dustin improvisation for improvisation, and a great deal of richness and humor came out of it.&quot;

===1990–1999: Established actor ===
In 1991, Hoffman voiced substitute teacher Mr. Bergstrom in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Substitute&quot;. He was credited under the pseudonym Sam Etic, a play on &quot;Semitic&quot;. Throughout the 1990s, Hoffman appeared in many large, studio films, such as &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (1990) (where his &quot;Ishtar&quot; co-star Beatty plays the titular character), &quot;Hero&quot; (1992) and &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot; (1991) co-starring with Nicole Kidman (who was nominated for a Golden Globe). Hoffman also played the title role of Captain Hook in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Hook&quot; (also 1991), earning a Golden Globe nomination, and the narrator in Dr. Seuss Video Classics: &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; (also 1992); in &quot;Hook&quot;, Hoffman&#x27;s costume was so heavy that he had to wear an air-conditioned suit under it. Hoffman played the lead role in &quot;Outbreak&quot; (1995), alongside Rene Russo, Kevin Spacey, Morgan Freeman, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Donald Sutherland. In the film, Hoffman is a medical doctor, serving as a Colonel in the U.S. Army Medical Corps., working at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), who uncovers a newly discovered Ebola-like virus which came to the U.S. from Africa in an infected monkey. Hoffman races to stop the virus&#x27;s spread and find a vaccine before it becomes a worldwide pandemic with no cure. It was one of the films that was produced by his production banner, Punch Productions.
The movie is described by critic Roger Ebert as &quot;one of the great scare stories of our time, the notion that deep in the uncharted rain forests, deadly diseases are lurking, and if they ever escape their jungle homes and enter the human bloodstream, there will be a new plague the likes of which we have never seen.&quot; Critic David Denby credits Hoffman with giving the movie much of its thriller-like quality:
Following that, he appeared in the 1996 revenge drama/legal thriller &quot;Sleepers&quot; (1996) with Robert De Niro, Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, and Kevin Bacon. In the mid-1990s, Hoffman starred in—and was deeply involved in the production of—David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;American Buffalo&quot; (also 1996), and an early effort of film editor Kate Sanford. In 1997, Hoffman starred opposite John Travolta in the Costa Gavras film &quot;Mad City&quot;. Hoffman gained his seventh Academy Award nomination for his performance in &quot;Wag The Dog&quot; (1997), in a role that allowed Hoffman the chance to work with both Robert De Niro and Denis Leary. The movie is a black comedy film produced and directed by Barry Levinson, who also directed Hoffman in &quot;Rain Man&quot; in 1988. The story takes place a few days before a presidential election, where a Washington, D.C. spin doctor (De Niro) distracts the electorate from a sex scandal by hiring a Hollywood film producer (Hoffman) to construct a fake war with Albania. Hoffman, as a caricature of real life producer Robert Evans, according to some, &quot;gives the kind of wonderfully funny performance that is liable to win prizes, especially since its mixture of affection and murderous parody is so precise. Stanley (Hoffman) conducts business meetings in tennis clothes or in robe and slippers&quot;, notes critic Janet Maslin.
He next appeared in another Barry Levinson film, the science fiction psychological thriller, &quot;Sphere&quot; (1998), opposite Sharon Stone. In 1999, Hoffman received the AFI Life Achievement Award and recalls the emotional impact that receiving the award had on him, &quot;There was this reel of pictures, me playing all these different roles. I had my first—and only, thank God—panic attack. What followed was depression. ... It had to do with a central core in me, which was that I never felt I deserved success&quot;. Hoffman next appeared in &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot; (2002), followed by &quot;Confidence&quot; (2003) opposite Edward Burns, Andy García and Rachel Weisz. Hoffman finally had a chance to work with Gene Hackman in Gary Fleder&#x27;s &quot;Runaway Jury&quot; (also 2003), an adaptation of John Grisham&#x27;s bestselling novel. Hoffman played theater owner Charles Frohman in the J. M. Barrie historical fantasia &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; (2004), costarring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet. In director David O. Russell&#x27;s &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; (also 2004), Hoffman appeared opposite Lily Tomlin as an existential detective team member. In 2001, his Punch Productions company went to a first look deal with The Walt Disney Studios.

Seven years after his nomination for &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;, Hoffman got another opportunity to perform again with Robert De Niro, co-starring with Streisand and Ben Stiller in the 2004 comedy &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; (2000). Hoffman won the 2005 MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance. In 2005, he voiced a horse in &quot;Racing Stripes&quot;, and appeared in cameo roles in Andy García&#x27;s &quot;The Lost City&quot; and on the final episode of HBO sitcom &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;″s fifth season. Hoffman appeared in &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot; (2006), played the perfumer Giuseppe Baldini in Tom Tykwer&#x27;s film &quot;&quot; (also 2006). In 2007, he was featured in an advertising campaign for Australian telecommunications company Telstra&#x27;s Next G network, appeared in the 50 Cent video &quot;Follow My Lead&quot; as a psychiatrist, and played the title character in the British family film &quot;Mr. Magorium&#x27;s Wonder Emporium&quot; for which he was nominated for a BIFA for Best Performance by an Actor in a British Independent Film at the British Independent Film Awards 2007. In 2008, although he was reluctant to perform in an animated feature film (despite previously performing voices in a version of &quot;The Point!&quot; and in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;), Hoffman had a prominent role as Shifu in the film &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot;, which was praised in part for his comedic chemistry with Jack Black (whom he tutored in acting for an important scene) and his character&#x27;s poignantly complex relationship with the story&#x27;s villain. He later won the Annie Award for Voice Acting in an Animated Feature for his performance and has continued into the role in the franchise&#x27;s subsequent filmed productions outside of the franchise&#x27;s television series. He next voiced Roscuro in &quot;The Tale of Despereaux&quot;.

As the title character in &quot;Last Chance Harvey&quot;, Hoffman acted with co-star Emma Thompson in the story of two lonely people who tentatively forge a relationship over the course of three days. Director Joel Hopkins notes that Hoffman was a perfectionist and self-critical: &quot;He often wanted to try things stripped down, because less is sometimes more. He worries about every little detail.&quot;

===2010–present ===

He appears in &quot;Little Fockers&quot;, the critically panned yet financially successful 2010 sequel to &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot;. However, his character plays a significantly smaller role than in the previous installment. In 2011, Hoffman reprised his role as Master Shifu in the commercially and critically successful animated film &quot;Kung Fu Panda 2&quot;. In 2012, Hoffman&#x27;s audiobook recording of Jerzy Kosinski&#x27;s &quot;Being There&quot; was released at Audible.com. Hoffman starred in the HBO horse racing drama &quot;Luck&quot;, as a man involved in bookmaking and casino operations. &quot;Luck&quot; was canceled in March 2012 after three horses died on set.

In 2012, Hoffman made his directorial debut with &quot;Quartet&quot;, starring Maggie Smith, Tom Courtenay, Pauline Collins, Billy Connolly, and Michael Gambon. The BBC comedy-drama premiered at the 2012 Toronto Film Festival where it earned respectable reviews from critics. Smith was nominated for Golden Globe for her performance. In 2015, Hoffman starred in &quot;Roald Dahl&#x27;s Esio Trot&quot;, a BBC television film adaptation of Roald Dahl&#x27;s classic novel, adapted by Richard Curtis and co-starring Judi Dench. Hoffman received an Emmy Award for Best Performance by an Actor. In 2016, he once again lent his voice to Master Shifu in the animated feature &quot;Kung Fu Panda 3&quot;.
In 2017, Hoffman starred in Noah Baumbach&#x27;s Netflix film &quot;The Meyerowitz Stories&quot; alongside Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Elizabeth Marvel and Emma Thompson. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 21, 2017, where it received a four-minute standing ovation. In 2017, Hoffman was honored with the Gotham Awards Tribute alongside Sofia Coppola, Nicole Kidman, Edward Lachman. Hoffman was introduced by Elizabeth Marvel.

In 2020, it was announced that Hoffman would make his return to the Broadway stage in Scott Rudin&#x27;s revival of &quot;Our Town&quot; as the Stage Manager. Hoffman&#x27;s last appearance on stage was 30 years prior in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; in 1989. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Broadway theaters remained shut until 2021. Hoffman appeared alongside Candice Bergen, Dianna Agron and Simon Helberg in &quot;As They Made Us&quot; directed by Mayim Bialik. He also starred alongside Sissy Spacek and his son Jake Hoffman in Darren Le Gallo&#x27;s directorial film debut &quot;Sam &amp; Kate&quot; which began filming in February 2022. In September 2021, he was attached to feature comedy film &quot;Mr. Shaw Goes To Hollywood&quot; as MGM studio head, Louis B Mayer. Filming would tentatively commence fall 2021.

In October 2022, Hoffman was cast in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s latest film, a dystopian science fiction epic &quot;Megalopolis&quot;. The film reunited Hoffman with his &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; costar Jon Voight. The film premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival. Hoffman is attached to Peter Greenaway&#x27;s upcoming film &quot;Lucca Mortis&quot;, which has started filming in the Tuscan city of Lucca. Most recently, he has reprised his role as Master Shifu in &quot;Kung Fu Panda 4&quot; (2024).

== Style and reception == 
David Thomson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described of Hoffman as a central figure of the late 60s, 70s and 80s&quot; adding, &quot;He is a part of what has turned out a very ambiguous vintage: it also includes Jack Nicholson, Robert Redford, Warren Beatty and Woody Allen, actors who cannot quite make up their minds whether they are adorable still or national treasures.&quot;

In 2017, the Gotham Awards announced that they would recognize Hoffman for his lifetime achievement in film. The director of the Independent Filmmaker Project (IFP) and Made in NY Media Center stated, &quot;We are thrilled to present Dustin Hoffman with the Actor Tribute. Starting with his breakthrough role in the timeless classic &quot;The Graduate&quot; to his highly praised turn in his upcoming film, &quot;The Meyerowitz Stories&quot;, Dustin&#x27;s wide range of roles – often portraying antiheroes or the marginalized – and the creative choices he has embodied in these complex characters, has firmly placed him amongst the most compelling actors to have graced the screen.&quot;

Actor Robert De Niro has described him as &quot;an actor with the everyman&#x27;s face who embodied the heartbreakingly human&quot;. Actress Elizabeth Marvel introduced Hoffman where she talked about the influence he&#x27;s had over her career and stated, &quot;His work is never anything less than extraordinary&quot;.

== Acting credits and accolades ==
In 1999, Hoffman was honored by the American Film Institute, who celebrated him with the 27th Life Achievement Award. Those who praised him and celebrated his work included Edward Norton, Jon Voight, Goldie Hawn, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Kathy Bates. Jack Nicholson presented Hoffman with the award. Upon receiving the award he quoted the poet Emily Dickinson, &quot;Not knowing when the dawn will come, I open the door&quot;.

In 2009, Hoffman received an Honorary Cesar Medal at the César Awards. In 2012, Dustin Hoffman received Kennedy Center Honors, with the following commendation: &quot;Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s unyielding commitment to the wide variety of roles he plays has made him one of the most versatile and iconoclastic actors of this or any other generation&quot;. Those who honored him at the ceremony included Robert De Niro, Liev Schreiber, Naomi Watts, and Billy Connolly.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and relationships===
After meeting in 1963, Hoffman married Anne Byrne in May 1969. He adopted Karina (b. 1967), Byrne&#x27;s child from a previous marriage, and with Byrne had daughter Jenna (born October 15, 1969). In 1970, Hoffman and Byrne were living in Greenwich Village in a building next door to a townhouse occupied at the time by members of the Weathermen, when a bomb was accidentally detonated in the townhouse&#x27;s basement, killing three. In the 2002 documentary &quot;The Weather Underground&quot;, Hoffman can be seen standing in the street during the aftermath of the explosion. The couple divorced in 1980.

After Hoffman&#x27;s separation, he began seeing Lisa Gottsegen, their families having had a relationship together growing up. She was finishing her Juris Doctor degree, and the couple married in October 1980. They have four children: Jacob Edward (born March 22, 1981), Rebecca Lillian (b. March 17, 1983), Maxwell Geoffrey (born August 30, 1984) and Alexandra Lydia &quot;Ali&quot; (born October 27, 1987). Hoffman has a few grandchildren as of 2024.

In an interview, he said that all of his children from his second marriage had bar or bat mitzvahs and that he is a more observant Jew now than when he was younger. He has also lamented that he is not fluent in Hebrew.

===Political activism===
A liberal, Hoffman has long supported the Democratic Party and Ralph Nader. In 1997 he was one of a number of Hollywood stars and executives to sign an open letter to the German chancellor Helmut Kohl protesting against the treatment of Scientologists in Germany, which was published as a newspaper advertisement in the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;.

===Cancer treatment===
Hoffman was successfully treated for cancer in 2013.

===Sexual misconduct allegations===
In 2017, seven women accused Hoffman of sexual misconduct or assault. Anna Graham Hunter alleged that, while she was 17 and working as an intern on a TV production of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, Hoffman made inappropriate jokes and comments around her and asked her to give him foot massages. Hoffman released an apology to Hunter, saying &quot;I have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation&quot;, continuing, &quot;I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am.&quot; Online magazine &quot;Slate&quot; reported in 2017 that Meryl Streep had differences with Hoffman which include him slapping her in a scene and him groping her breast. However, a representative for Meryl Streep responded to &quot;Slate&quot; saying it was not an accurate rendering of their 1979 meeting. Streep&#x27;s representative stated &quot;there was an offense and it is something for which Dustin apologized. And Meryl accepted that.&quot;

In December 2017, comedian John Oliver unexpectedly questioned Hoffman about the allegations during the 20th anniversary screening of &quot;Wag the Dog&quot; at the 92nd Street Y. &quot;It&#x27;s &#x27;not reflective of who I am&#x27; – it&#x27;s that kind of response to this stuff that pisses me off,&quot; Oliver said. &quot;Do you understand how that feels like a dismissal?&quot; Hoffman said he felt blindsided by the line of questioning, remarking &quot;You&#x27;ve made the case better than anyone else can. I&#x27;m guilty. Because someone has alleged something, I&#x27;m guilty. You push a button. It&#x27;s all over the world: I&#x27;m a predator. I&#x27;m this and that, and it&#x27;s not true.&quot; Hoffman has not publicly responded to the other six allegations.

Bill Murray, who costarred with Hoffman in &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Lost City&quot; (2005), defended him, saying, &quot;I heard what happened to him, and Dustin Hoffman is a really decent person. He&#x27;s crazy, a Borscht Belt flirt, has been his whole life. (But) he&#x27;s a really sweet man.&quot; Actors 
Chevy Chase and Liam Neeson also came to his defense.

<text>Janez Strnad (March 4, 1934 – November 28, 2015) was a Slovene physicist and popularizer of natural science.

== Life and work ==

Strnad was born in Ljubljana, Kingdom of Yugoslavia (now Slovenia).

He received a degree at the University of Ljubljana in technical physics in 1957, and got his Ph.D. in 1963. His main research work was carried out at the Jožef Stefan Institute. 
He taught for many years beginning in 1961 at the University of Ljubljana, Faculty for natural science and technology on the Department of physics introductory courses and topics from physics. 
In 1974 he became a full professor. In 1990 he wrote a book about fundamental particles physics entitled &quot;Iz take so snovi kot sanje&quot; (&quot;We are such stuff as dreams are made of&quot;). With his short and long articles he had deepened the knowledge about Stefan&#x27;s scientific work. His thick booklet in the series of monographs, &quot;Zbirka Sigma&quot; (the Sigma Collection), entitled &quot;Kvantna fizika&quot; (&quot;Quantum Physics&quot;), (DZS, Ljubljana 1974) contains a definition and introduction to the understanding of Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle for the graduate beginner. He wrote over 1000 works.

Strnad&#x27;s works also includes topics of physics which are not exactly related at first glance to it, for instance as in this his article &quot;Znanost in politika v vinjetah&quot; (&quot;Science and politics in vignettes&quot;)].

<text>Parashurama (), also referred to as Rama Jamadagnya, Rama Bhargava and Virarama, is the sixth avatar among the Dashavatara of the preserver god Vishnu in Hinduism. Hindu tradition holds him to be the destroyer of the evil on Earth. According to legends, Shiva advised him to go and liberate the Mother Earth from felons, ill-behaved men, extremists, demons and those blind with pride. He is described as one amongst the &quot;Chiranjivis&quot; (Immortals), who will appear at the end of the &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; to be the guru of Vishnu&#x27;s tenth and last incarnation, Kalki. 

Born to Jamadagni and Renuka, the Brahmin Parashurama was foretold to appear at a time when overwhelming evil prevailed on the earth. The Kshatriya class, with weapons and power, had begun to abuse their power, take what belonged to others by force and tyrannise people. He corrected the cosmic equilibrium by destroying these Kshatriyas twenty-one times (leaving some lineages). He is married to Dharani, an incarnation of Lakshmi, the wife of Vishnu. 

In the epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;, he arrives after Sita Swayamvara, upon hearing the loud noise when Rama uplifts and breaks the divine bow Pinaka. He later deduces that Rama is Vishnu himself, he himself asked Rama to destroy the fruits of his austerities. 

In the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot; he was the guru of Bhisma, Drona, Rukmi and Karna. 

Parashurama is said to carry various traits including courage, aggression, and warfare along with serenity, patience and prudence. He was known to show his benevolence to Brahmins, children, women, old men and other weaker sections of the society.

== Legend ==
According to Hindu history, Parashurama was born to the sage Jamadagni and his Kshatriya wife, Renuka. In local tradition, it is believed they lived in a hut located at Janapav. They had a celestial cow called Surabhi, which gives them all that they desire (Surabhi is the daughter of cow &quot;Kamadhenu&quot;). A king named Kartavirya Arjuna (not to be confused with Arjuna, the Pandava) learns about this cow of plenty and wants it. He asks Jamadagni to give it to him, but the sage refuses. While Parashurama is away from the hut, the king takes it by force. When Jamadagni pleads his case and seeks for the return of the cow, the king strikes him with his fist, killing him. Parashurama learns about this crime, and is upset. With his axe in his hand, he challenges the king to battle. They fight, and Parashurama defeats and kills the king, according to the &quot;Padma Purana&quot;.

The warrior class challenges him, and he slays every single member of the class, save for those belonging to the lineages of Manu and Ikshvaku. The mighty son of Jamadagni, having rid the world of the Kshatriyas, then performs the ashvamedha sacrifice. He grants the earth with the seven islands to principal rishis belonging to the Brahmin class. Having renounced the earth and his violent deeds, he retires to the hermitage of Nara-Narayana to engage in penance. The legend likely has roots in the ancient conflict between the Brahmin varna, with knowledge duties, and the Kshatriya varna, with warrior and enforcement roles.

=== Epic Ramayana ===
In the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, following Rama&#x27;s wedding to Sita at Mithila and during their homeward journey to Ayodhya, his party comes across a number of inauspicious signs. Amid an earthquake and a dust storm, Parashurama appears before the party. After accepting the libation offered to him, Parashurama challenges Rama to combat, on the condition that the prince show his strength to the sage by placing a bow within the string of the latter&#x27;s bow, Sharanga, and discharging it. Ignoring Dasharatha&#x27;s plea to spare Rama this task, Parashurama relays the divine origin of the bow and the history of its ownership, appealing to Rama&#x27;s skills as a warrior. Rama seizes the bow from Parashurama and strings it, an act that causes the latter to become bereft of his divine power. Humbled, Parashurama acknowledges that Rama is an incarnation of Vishnu and requests the prince to allow him to return to the mountain Mahendra so that he could practice yoga and accrue merit. After circumambulating Rama in worship, Parashurama returns to his hermitage.
=== Epic Mahabharata ===

==== Bhishma ====
In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Parashurama intercedes on the princess Amba&#x27;s behalf, promising to command his disciple Bhishma to do his duty and marry her after her abduction. When Parashurama arrives with his retinue at Kurukshetra, he sends a message to Bhishma to inform him of his arrival. Bhishma comes to see his guru, offering him the traditional respects. Parashurama commands Bhishma to accept Amba as his wife. Bhishma refuses, restating that he had taken a vow of celibacy. An infuriated Parashurama threatens Bhishma with death. Bhishma tries to calm the sage, but in vain, and he finally agrees to battle his guru to safeguard his Kshatriya duty. Ganga tries stopping the battle by beseeching her son as well as the great sage, but fails. The great battle lasts for 23 days, without any result. On the 24th day, when Bhishma chooses to use a deadly weapon, at the behest of the divine sage Narada and the devas, Parashurama ends the conflict and the battle is declared a draw. Parashurama narrates the events to Amba and urges her to seek Bhishma&#x27;s protection. However, Amba refuses to listen to Parashurama&#x27;s advice and angrily declares that she would achieve her objective by asceticism.

==== Karna ====

=== Parshuram Kshetra ===

There are legends dealing with the origins of the western coast geographically and culturally. One such legend is the retrieval of the west coast from the sea, by Parashurama. It proclaims that Parashurama, an incarnation of Mahavishnu, threw his battle axe into the sea. As a result, the land of the western coast arose, and thus was reclaimed from the waters. The place from which he threw his axe (or shot an arrow) is on Salher fort (the second highest peak and the highest fort in Maharashtra) in the Baglan taluka of Nashik district of Maharashtra. There is a temple on the summit of this fort dedicated to Parshuram and there are footprints in the rock four times the size of normal humans. This fort on a lower plateau has a temple of goddess Renuka, Parshuram&#x27;s mother and also a Yagya Kunda with pits for poles to erect a shamiyana on the banks of a big water tank. 

According to the Sangam classic &quot;Purananuru&quot;, the Chera king Senkuttuvan conquered the lands between Kanyakumari and the Himalayas. Lacking worthy enemies, he besieged the sea by throwing his spear into it. According to the 17th-century Malayalam work &quot;Keralolpathi&quot;, the lands of Kerala were recovered from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parashurama, the sixth incarnation of Vishnu (hence, Kerala is also called &quot;Parashurama Kshetram&quot; &#x27;The Land of Parashurama&#x27;). Parashurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached. According to legend, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari. The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parashurama invoked the snake king Vasuki, who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land. P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar has theorised that Senguttuvan may have been inspired by the Parashurama legend, which was brought by early Aryan settlers.

In present-day Goa (or Gomantak), which is a part of the Konkan, there is a temple in Canacona in South Goa district dedicated to Parashurama.

== Shastras ==
Parashurama is generally presented as the fifth son of Renuka and Rishi Jamadagni. The legends of Parashurama appear in many Hindu texts, in different versions:

=== Devi Bhagvata Purana ===
In Chapter 6 of the &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot;, he is born from the thigh with intense light surrounding him that blinds all warriors, who then repent their evil ways and promise to lead a moral life if their eyesight is restored. The boy grants them the boon.
Parashurama retired in the Mahendra Mountains, according to chapter 2.3.47 of the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;.

=== Vishnu Purana ===
In Chapter 4 of the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, Rcika prepares a meal for two women, one simple, and another with ingredients that if eaten would cause the woman to conceive a son with martial powers. The latter is accidentally eaten by Renuka, and she then gives birth to Parashurama.

=== Vayu Purana ===
In Chapter 2 of the &quot;Vayu Purana&quot;, he is born after his mother Renuka eats a sacrificial offering made to both Rudra (Shiva) and Vishnu, which gives him dual characteristics of Kshatriya and Brahmin.

=== Mahabharata ===
Parashurama is described in some versions of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; as the angry Brahmin who with his axe, killed a huge number of Kshatriya warriors because they were abusing their power. In some versions, he even kills his own mother because his father asks him to in order to test his obeisance. After Parashurama obeys his father&#x27;s order to kill his mother, his father grants him a boon. Parashurama asks for the reward that his mother be brought back to life, and she is restored to life. Parashurama remains filled with sorrow after the violence, repents and expiates his sin. After his Mother comes back to life, he tries to clean the blood-stained axe but he finds a drop of blood which he was unable to clean and tries cleaning the blood drop in different rivers. This is when he moves towards the south of India in search of any holy river where he could clean his axe, finally, he reaches Tirthahalli village in Shimoga, Karnataka and tries to clean the axe and to his surprise, the axe gets cleaned in the holy river of Tunga. With respect towards the holy river, he constructs a Shiva linga and performs pooja and the temple is named as Rameshwara temple. The place where Parashurama cleaned his axe is called Ramakunda.

He plays important roles in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; serving as mentor to Bhishma (chapter 5.178), Drona (chapter 1.121) and Karna (chapter 3.286), teaching weapon arts and helping key warriors in both sides of the war.

In the regional literature of Kerala, he is the founder of the land, the one who brought it out of the sea and settled a Hindu community there. He is also known as Rama Jamadagnya and Rama Bhargava in some Hindu texts. He is the only incarnation of Vishnu who never dies, never returns to abstract Vishnu and lives in meditative retirement. Further, he is the only incarnation of Vishnu that co-exists with other Vishnu incarnations Rama and Krishna in some versions of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, respectively.

=== Samanta Panchaka ===
According to the Sangraha Parva, after killing 21 generations of Kshatriyas, he filled their blood in five pools collectively known as the &quot;Samantha Panchaka&quot; (Sanskrit: ). He later atoned for his sin by severe penance. The five pools are considered to be holy.

The Anukramanika Parva says that the Samantha Panchaka is located somewhere around Kurukshetra. It also mentions that the Pandavas performed a few religious rites near the Samantha Panchaka before the Kurukshetra War.

==Parashurama Kshetra==
There is much interpretation of &#x27;Parashurama Kshetra&#x27; (Land of Parashurama) mentioned in the Puranas.

The region on the western coast of India from Gokarna to Kanyakumari was known as Parashurama Kshetra.

The region of Konkan was also considered as Parashurama Kshetra.

The ancient Saptakonkana is a slightly larger region described in the Sahyadrikhanda which refers to it as Parashuramakshetra (Sanskrit for &quot;The Land Of Parashurama&quot;), Vapi to Tapi is an area of South Gujarat, India. This area is called &quot;Parshuram Ni Bhoomi&quot;.

==Iconography==

The Hindu literature on iconography such as the &quot;Vishnudharmottara Purana&quot; and &quot;Rupamandana&quot; describes him as a man with matted locks, with two hands, one carrying an axe. However, the &quot;Agni Purana&quot; portrays his iconography with four hands, carrying his axe, bow, arrow and sword. The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; describes his icon as one with four hands, carrying his axe, bow, arrows and a shield like a warrior. Though a warrior, his representation inside Hindu temples with him in war scenes is rare (the Basohli temple is one such exception). Typically, he is shown with two hands, with an axe in his right hand either seated or standing.

== In popular culture ==
The Parashurama avatar symbolizes the strict and non-relinquishing aspect of showing &quot;daya&quot; (mercy), where he has to be harsh for the well being of the &quot;srushti&quot; (world). 

On top of the hills of Janapav is a Shiva temple where Parashurama is believed to have worshipped Shiva, the ashram is known as Jamadagni Ashram, named after his father. The place also has a Kund (Pond) that is being developed by the state government.

In Kannada folklore, especially in devotional songs sung by the Devdasis he is often referred to as a son of Yellamma. Parashurama legends are notable for their discussion of violence, the cycles of retaliations, the impulse of &quot;krodha&quot; (anger), the inappropriateness of &quot;krodha&quot;, and repentance.

<text>Krishna (; Sanskrit: कृष्ण, ) is a major deity in Hinduism. He is worshipped as the eighth avatar of Vishnu and also as the Supreme God in his own right. He is the god of protection, compassion, tenderness, and love; and is widely revered among Hindu divinities. Krishna&#x27;s birthday is celebrated every year by Hindus on Krishna Janmashtami according to the lunisolar Hindu calendar, which falls in late August or early September of the Gregorian calendar.

The anecdotes and narratives of Krishna&#x27;s life are generally titled as &quot;Krishna Līlā&quot;. He is a central figure in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, the &quot;Brahma Vaivarta Purana,&quot; and the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, and is mentioned in many Hindu philosophical, theological, and mythological texts. They portray him in various perspectives: as a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero, and the universal supreme being. His iconography reflects these legends and shows him in different stages of his life, such as an infant eating butter, a young boy playing a flute, a young boy with Radha or surrounded by female devotees, or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to Arjuna.

The name and synonyms of Krishna have been traced to 1stmillenniumBCE literature and cults. In some sub-traditions, like Krishnaism, Krishna is worshipped as the Supreme God and &quot;Svayam Bhagavan&quot; (God Himself). These sub-traditions arose in the context of the medieval era Bhakti movement. Krishna-related literature has inspired numerous performance arts such as Bharatanatyam, Kathakali, Kuchipudi, Odissi, and Manipuri dance. He is a pan-Hindu god, but is particularly revered in some locations, such as Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh, Dwarka and Junagadh in Gujarat; the Jagannatha aspect in Odisha, Mayapur in West Bengal; in the form of Vithoba in Pandharpur, Maharashtra, Shrinathji at Nathdwara in Rajasthan, Udupi Krishna in Karnataka, Parthasarathy in Tamil Nadu and in Aranmula, Kerala, and Guruvayoorappan in Guruvayoor in Kerala. 

Since the 1960s, the worship of Krishna has also spread to the Western world and to Africa, largely due to the work of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).

== Names and epithets ==
The name &quot;Krishna&quot; originates from the Sanskrit word &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;black&quot;, &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;dark blue&quot;. The waning moon is called Krishna Paksha, relating to the adjective meaning &quot;darkening&quot;. Some Vaishnavas also translate the word as &quot;All-Attractive&quot;, though it lacks that meaning in Sanskrit.

As a name of Vishnu, Krishna is listed as the 57th name in the &quot;Vishnu Sahasranama&quot;. Based on his name, Krishna is often depicted in idols as black- or blue-skinned. Krishna is also known by various other names, epithets, and titles that reflect his many associations and attributes. Among the most common names are &quot;Mohan&quot; &quot;enchanter&quot;; &quot;Govinda&quot; &quot;chief herdsman&quot;, &quot;Keev&quot; &quot;prankster&quot;, and &quot;Gopala&quot; &quot;Protector of the &#x27;Go&#x27;&quot;, which means &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;the cows&quot;. Some names for Krishna hold regional importance; &quot;Jagannatha&quot;, found in the Puri Hindu temple, is a popular incarnation in Odisha state and nearby regions of eastern India.

== Historical and literary sources ==
The tradition of Krishna appears to be an amalgamation of several independent deities of ancient India, the earliest to be attested being Vāsudeva. Vāsudeva was a hero-god of the tribe of the Vrishnis, belonging to the Vrishni heroes, whose worship is attested from the 5th–6th century BCE in the writings of Pāṇini, and from the 2nd century BCE in epigraphy with the Heliodorus pillar. At one point in time, it is thought that the tribe of the Vrishnis fused with the tribe of the Yadavas, whose own hero-god was named Krishna. Vāsudeva and Krishna fused to become a single deity, which appears in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, and they started to be identified with Vishnu in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;. Around the 4th century CE, another tradition, the cult of Gopala-Krishna of the Ābhīras, the protector of cattle, was also absorbed into the Krishna tradition.

===Early epigraphic sources===
====Depiction in coinage (2nd century BCE)====

Around 180 BCE, the Indo-Greek king Agathocles issued some coinage (discovered in Ai-Khanoum, Afghanistan) bearing images of deities that are now interpreted as being related to Vaisnava imagery in India. The deities displayed on the coins appear to be Saṃkarṣaṇa-Balarama with attributes consisting of the Gada mace and the plow, and Vāsudeva-Krishna with attributes of the Shankha (conch) and the Sudarshana Chakra wheel. According to Bopearachchi, the headdress of the deity is actually a misrepresentation of a shaft with a half-moon parasol on top (chattra).

====Inscriptions====

The Heliodorus Pillar, a stone pillar with a Brahmi script inscription, was discovered by colonial era archaeologists in Besnagar (Vidisha, in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh). Based on the internal evidence of the inscription, it has been dated to between 125 and 100BCE and is now known after Heliodorus – an Indo-Greek who served as an ambassador of the Greek king Antialcidas to a regional Indian king, Kasiputra Bhagabhadra. The Heliodorus pillar inscription is a private religious dedication of Heliodorus to &quot;Vāsudeva&quot;, an early deity and another name for Krishna in the Indian tradition. It states that the column was constructed by &quot;the &quot;Bhagavata&quot; Heliodorus&quot; and that it is a &quot;&quot;Garuda&quot; pillar&quot; (both are Vishnu-Krishna-related terms). Additionally, the inscription includes a Krishna-related verse from chapter11.7 of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; stating that the path to immortality and heaven is to correctly live a life of three virtues: self-temperance (&quot;damah&quot;), generosity (&quot;cagah&quot; or &quot;tyaga&quot;), and vigilance (&quot;apramadah&quot;). The Heliodorus pillar site was fully excavated by archaeologists in the 1960s. The effort revealed the brick foundations of a much larger ancient elliptical temple complex with a sanctum, &quot;mandapas&quot;, and seven additional pillars. The Heliodorus pillar inscriptions and the temple are among the earliest known evidence of Krishna-Vasudeva devotion and Vaishnavism in ancient India.

The Heliodorus inscription is not isolated evidence. The Hathibada Ghosundi Inscriptions, all located in the state of Rajasthan and dated by modern methodology to the 1stcenturyBCE, mention Saṃkarṣaṇa and Vāsudeva, also mention that the structure was built for their worship in association with the supreme deity Narayana. These four inscriptions are notable for being some of the oldest-known Sanskrit inscriptions.

A Mora stone slab found at the Mathura-Vrindavan archaeological site in Uttar Pradesh, held now in the Mathura Museum, has a Brahmi inscription. It is dated to the 1stcenturyCE and mentions the five Vrishni heroes, otherwise known as Saṃkarṣaṇa, Vāsudeva, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, and Samba.

The inscriptional record for Vāsudeva starts in the 2nd century BCE with the coinage of Agathocles and the Heliodorus pillar, but the name of Krishna appears rather later in epigraphy. At the Chilas II archaeological site dated to the first half of the 1st-century CE in northwest Pakistan, near the Afghanistan border, are engraved two males, along with many Buddhist images nearby. The larger of the two males held a plough and club in his two hands. The artwork also has an inscription with it in Kharosthi script, which has been deciphered by scholars as &quot;Rama-Krsna&quot;, and interpreted as an ancient depiction of the two brothers, Balarama and Krishna.

The first known depiction of the life of Krishna himself comes relatively late, with a relief found in Mathura, and dated to the 1st–2nd century CE. This fragment seems to show Vasudeva, Krishna&#x27;s father, carrying baby Krishna in a basket across the Yamuna. The relief shows at one end a seven-hooded Naga crossing a river, where a &quot;makara&quot; crocodile is thrashing around, and at the other end a person seemingly holding a basket over his head.

===Literary sources===
==== Mahabharata ====
The earliest text containing detailed descriptions of Krishna as a personality is the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, which depicts Krishna as an incarnation of Vishnu. Krishna is central to many of the main stories of the epic. The eighteen chapters of the sixth book (&quot;Bhishma Parva&quot;) of the epic that constitute the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; contain the advice of Krishna to Arjuna on the battlefield.

During the ancient times that the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; was composed in, Krishna was widely seen as an avatar of Vishnu rather than an individual deity, yet he was immensely powerful and almost everything in the universe other than Vishnu was &quot;somehow present in the body of Krishna&quot;. Krishna had &quot;no beginning or end&quot;, &quot;fill[ed] space&quot;, and every god but Vishnu was seen as ultimately him, including Brahma, &quot;storm gods, sun gods, bright gods&quot;, light gods, &quot;and gods of ritual.&quot; Other forces also existed in his body, such as &quot;hordes of varied creatures&quot; that included &quot;celestial serpents.&quot; He is also &quot;the essence of humanity.&quot;

The &quot;Harivamsa&quot;, a later appendix to the &quot;Mahabharata,&quot; contains a detailed version of Krishna&#x27;s childhood and youth.

==== Other sources ====

The &quot;Chandogya Upanishad&quot; (verse III.xvii.6) mentions Krishna in &quot;Krishnaya Devakiputraya&quot; as a student of the sage Ghora of the Angirasa family. Ghora is identified with Neminatha, the twenty-second &quot;tirthankara&quot; in Jainism, by some scholars. This phrase, which means &quot;To Krishna the son of Devaki&quot;, has been mentioned by scholars such as Max Müller as a potential source of fables and Vedic lore about Krishna in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and other ancient literature only potential because this verse could have been interpolated into the text, or the Krishna Devakiputra, could be different from the deity Krishna. These doubts are supported by the fact that the much later age &quot;Sandilya Bhakti Sutras&quot;, a treatise on Krishna, cites later age compilations such as the &quot;Narayana Upanishad&quot; but never cites this verse of the Chandogya Upanishad. Other scholars disagree that the Krishna mentioned along with Devaki in the ancient Upanishad is unrelated to the later Hindu god of the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; fame. For example, Archer states that the coincidence of the two names appearing together in the same Upanishad verse cannot be dismissed easily.

Yāska&#x27;s &quot;Nirukta&quot;, an etymological dictionary published around the 6thcenturyBCE, contains a reference to the Shyamantaka jewel in the possession of Akrura, a motif from the well-known Puranic story about Krishna. Shatapatha Brahmana and &quot;Aitareya-Aranyaka&quot; associate Krishna with his Vrishni origins.

In &quot;Ashṭādhyāyī&quot;, authored by the ancient grammarian Pāṇini (probably belonged to the 5th or 6thcenturyBCE), &quot;Vāsudeva&quot; and &quot;Arjuna&quot;, as recipients of worship, are referred to together in the same &quot;sutra&quot;.
Megasthenes, a Greek ethnographer and an ambassador of Seleucus I to the court of Chandragupta Maurya towards the end of 4thcenturyBCE, made reference to Herakles in his famous work Indica. This text is now lost to history, but was quoted in secondary literature by later Greeks such as Arrian, Diodorus, and Strabo. According to these texts, Megasthenes mentioned that the Sourasenoi tribe of India, who worshipped Herakles, had two major cities named Methora and Kleisobora, and a navigable river named the Jobares. According to Edwin Bryant, a professor of Indian religions known for his publications on Krishna, &quot;there is little doubt that the Sourasenoi refers to the Shurasenas, a branch of the Yadu dynasty to which Krishna belonged&quot;. The word Herakles, states Bryant, is likely a Greek phonetic equivalent of Hari-Krishna, as is Methora of Mathura, Kleisobora of Krishnapura, and the Jobares of Jamuna. Later, when Alexander the Great launched his campaign in the northwest Indian subcontinent, his associates recalled that the soldiers of Porus were carrying an image of Herakles.

The Buddhist Pali canon and the Ghata-Jâtaka (No. 454) polemically mention the devotees of Vâsudeva and Baladeva. These texts have many peculiarities and may be a garbled and confused version of the Krishna legends. The texts of Jainism mention these tales as well, also with many peculiarities and different versions, in their legends about Tirthankaras. This inclusion of Krishna-related legends in ancient Buddhist and Jaina literature suggests that Krishna theology was existent and important in the religious landscape observed by non-Hindu traditions of ancient India.

The ancient Sanskrit grammarian Patanjali in his &quot;Mahabhashya&quot; makes several references to Krishna and his associates found in later Indian texts. In his commentary on Pāṇini&#x27;s verse 3.1.26, he also uses the word &quot;Kamsavadha&quot; or the &quot;killing of Kamsa&quot;, an important part of the legends surrounding Krishna.

====Puranas====
Many Puranas tell Krishna&#x27;s life story or some highlights from it. Two Puranas, the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; and the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, contain the most elaborate telling of Krishna&#x27;s story, but the life stories of Krishna in these and other texts vary, and contain significant inconsistencies. The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; consists of twelve books subdivided into 332chapters, with a cumulative total of between 16,000 and 18,000 verses depending on the version. The tenth book of the text, which contains about 4,000 verses (~25%) and is dedicated to legends about Krishna, has been the most popular and widely studied part of this text.

== Iconography ==

Krishna is represented in the Indian traditions in many ways, but with some common features. His iconography typically depicts him with black, dark, or blue skin, like Vishnu. However, ancient and medieval reliefs and stone-based arts depict him in the natural color of the material out of which he is formed, both in India and in southeast Asia. In some texts, his skin is poetically described as the color of Jambul (&quot;Jamun&quot;, a purple-colored fruit).
Krishna is often depicted wearing a peacock-feather wreath or crown, and playing the bansuri (Indian flute). In this form, he is usually shown standing with one leg bent in front of the other in the &quot;Tribhanga&quot; posture. He is sometimes accompanied by cows or a calf, which symbolise the divine herdsman &quot;Govinda&quot;. Alternatively, he is shown as a romantic young boy with the gopis (milkmaids), often making music or playing pranks.
In other icons, he is a part of battlefield scenes of the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. He is shown as a charioteer, notably when he is addressing the Pandava prince Arjuna, symbolically reflecting the events that led to the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;a scripture of Hinduism. In these popular depictions, Krishna appears in the front as the charioteer, either as a counsel listening to Arjuna or as the driver of the chariot while Arjuna aims his arrows in the battlefield of Kurukshetra.

Alternate icons of Krishna show him as a baby (&quot;Bala Krishna&quot;, the child Krishna), a toddler crawling on his hands and knees, a dancing child, or an innocent-looking child playfully stealing or consuming butter (&quot;Makkan Chor&quot;), holding Laddu in his hand (&quot;Laddu Gopal&quot;) or as a cosmic infant sucking his toe while floating on a banyan leaf during the Pralaya (the cosmic dissolution) observed by sage Markandeya. Regional variations in the iconography of Krishna are seen in his different forms, such as Jaganatha in Odisha, Vithoba in Maharashtra, Shrinathji in Rajasthan and Guruvayoorappan in Kerala.

Guidelines for the preparation of Krishna icons in design and architecture are described in medieval-era Sanskrit texts on Hindu temple arts such as &quot;Vaikhanasa agama&quot;, &quot;Vishnu dharmottara&quot;, &quot;Brihat samhita&quot;, and &quot;Agni Purana&quot;. Similarly, early medieval-era Tamil texts also contain guidelines for sculpting Krishna and Rukmini. Several statues made according to these guidelines are in the collections of the Government Museum, Chennai.

Krishna iconography forms an important element in the figural sculpture on 17th–19th century terracotta temples of Bengal. In many temples, the stories of Krishna are depicted on a long series of narrow panels along the base of the facade. In other temples, the important Krishnalila episodes are depicted on large brick panels above the entrance arches or on the walls surrounding the entrance.

== Life and legends ==
This summary is an account based on literary details from the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, the &quot;Harivamsa&quot;, the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, and the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;. The scenes from the narrative are set in ancient India, mostly in the present states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi, and Gujarat. The legends about Krishna&#x27;s life are called &quot;Krishna charitas&quot; (IAST: Kṛṣṇacaritas).

=== Birth ===

In the &quot;Krishna Charitas&quot;, Krishna is born to Devaki and her husband, Vasudeva, of the Yadava clan in Mathura. Devaki&#x27;s brother is a tyrant named Kamsa. At Devaki&#x27;s wedding, according to Puranic legends, Kamsa is told by fortune tellers that a child of Devaki would kill him. Sometimes, it is depicted as an akashvani announcing Kamsa&#x27;s death. Kamsa arranges to kill all of Devaki&#x27;s children. When Krishna is born, Vasudeva secretly carries the infant Krishna away across the Yamuna, and exchanges him with Yashoda&#x27;s daughter. When Kamsa tries to kill the newborn, the exchanged baby appears as the Hindu goddess Yogamaya, warning him that his death has arrived in his kingdom, and then disappears, according to the legends in the Puranas. Krishna grows up with Nanda and his wife, Yashoda, near modern-day Mathura. Two of Krishna&#x27;s siblings also survive, namely Balarama and Subhadra, according to these legends. The day of the birth of Krishna is celebrated as Krishna Janmashtami.

=== Childhood and youth ===
The legends of Krishna&#x27;s childhood and youth describe him as a cow-herder, a mischievous boy whose pranks earn him the nickname &quot;Makhan Chor&quot; (butter thief), and a protector who steals the hearts of the people in both Gokul and Vrindavana. The texts state, for example, that Krishna lifts the Govardhana hill to protect the inhabitants of Vrindavana from devastating rains and floods.
Other legends describe him as an enchanter and playful lover of the gopis (milkmaids) of Vrindavana, especially Radha. These metaphor-filled love stories are known as the &quot;Rasa lila&quot; and were romanticized in the poetry of Jayadeva, author of the Gita Govinda. They are also central to the development of the Krishna bhakti traditions worshiping Radha Krishna.

Krishna&#x27;s childhood illustrates the Hindu concept of &quot;Lila&quot;, playing for fun and enjoyment and not for sport or gain. His interaction with the gopis at the rasa dance or Rasa-lila is an example. Krishna plays his flute and the gopis come immediately, from whatever they were doing, to the banks of the Yamuna River and join him in singing and dancing. Even those who could not physically be there join him through meditation. He is the spiritual essence and the love-eternal in existence, the gopis metaphorically represent the &quot;prakṛti&quot; matter and the impermanent body.

This &quot;Lila&quot; is a constant theme in the legends of Krishna&#x27;s childhood and youth. Even when he is battling with a serpent to protect others, he is described in Hindu texts as if he were playing a game. This quality of playfulness in Krishna is celebrated during festivals as Rasa-Lila and Janmashtami, where Hindus in some regions such as Maharashtra playfully mimic his legends, such as by making human gymnastic pyramids to break open &quot;handis&quot; (clay pots) hung high in the air to &quot;steal&quot; butter or buttermilk, spilling it all over the group.

=== Adulthood ===

Krishna legends then describe his return to Mathura. He overthrows and kills the tyrant king, his maternal uncle Kamsa/Kansa after quelling several assassination attempts by Kamsa. He reinstates Kamsa&#x27;s father, Ugrasena, as the king of the Yadavas and becomes a leading prince at the court. In one version of the Krishna story, as narrated by Shanta Rao, Krishna after Kamsa&#x27;s death leads the Yadavas to the newly built city of Dwaraka. Thereafter Pandavas rise. Krishna befriends Arjuna and the other Pandava princes of the Kuru kingdom. Krishna plays a key role in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

The Bhagavata Purana describes eight wives of Krishna that appear in sequence as Rukmini, Satyabhama, Jambavati, Kalindi, Mitravinda, Nagnajiti (also called Satya), Bhadra and Lakshmana (also called Madra). This has been interpreted as a metaphor where each of the eight wives signifies a different aspect of him. Vaishnava texts mention all Gopis as wives of Krishna, but this is understood as spiritual symbolism of devotional relationship and Krishna&#x27;s complete loving devotion to each and everyone devoted to him.

In Krishna-related Hindu traditions, he is most commonly seen with Radha. All of his wives and his lover Radha are considered in the Hindu tradition to be the avatars of the goddess Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu. Gopis are considered as Lakshmi&#x27;s or Radha&#x27;s manifestations.

=== Kurukshetra War and &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; ===

According to the epic poem &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Krishna becomes Arjuna&#x27;s charioteer for the Kurukshetra War, but on the condition that he personally will not raise any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield and seeing that the enemies are his family, his grandfather, and his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna is moved and says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom and put down his &quot;Gandiva&quot; (Arjuna&#x27;s bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war between good and evil, the impermanence of matter, the permanence of the soul and the good, duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and the different types of yoga to reach this state of bliss and inner liberation. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented as a discourse called the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;.

=== Death and ascension ===

It is stated in the Indian texts that the legendary Kurukshetra War led to the death of all the hundred sons of Gandhari. After Duryodhana&#x27;s death, Krishna visits Gandhari to offer his condolences when Gandhari and Dhritarashtra visited Kurukshetra, as stated in Stree Parva. Feeling that Krishna deliberately did not put an end to the war, in a fit of rage and sorrow, Gandhari said, &quot;Thou were indifferent to the Kurus and the Pandavas whilst they slew each other. Therefore, O Govinda, thou shalt be the slayer of thy own kinsmen!&quot; According to the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, a fight breaks out at a festival among the Yadavas, who end up killing each other. Mistaking the sleeping Krishna for a deer, a hunter named Jara shoots an arrow towards Krishna&#x27;s foot that fatally injures him. Krishna forgives &quot;Jara&quot; and dies. The pilgrimage (&quot;tirtha&quot;) site of Bhalka in Gujarat marks the location where Krishna is believed to have died. It is also known as &quot;Dehotsarga&quot;, states Diana L. Eck, a term that literally means the place where Krishna &quot;gave up his body&quot;. The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; in Book 11, Chapter 31 states that after his death, Krishna returned to his transcendent abode directly because of his yogic concentration. Waiting gods such as Brahma and Indra were unable to trace the path Krishna took to leave his human incarnation and return to his abode.

=== Versions and interpretations ===

There are numerous versions of Krishna&#x27;s life story, of which three are most studied: the &quot;Harivamsa&quot;, the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, and the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;. They share the basic storyline but vary significantly in their specifics, details, and styles. The most original composition, the &quot;Harivamsa&quot; is told in a realistic style that describes Krishna&#x27;s life as a poor herder but weaves in poetic and allusive fantasy. It ends on a triumphal note, not with the death of Krishna. Differing in some details, the fifth book of the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; moves away from &quot;Harivamsa&quot; realism and embeds Krishna in mystical terms and eulogies. The &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; manuscripts exist in many versions.

The tenth and eleventh books of the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; are widely considered to be a poetic masterpiece, full of imagination and metaphors, with no relation to the realism of pastoral life found in the &quot;Harivamsa&quot;. Krishna&#x27;s life is presented as a cosmic play (&quot;Lila&quot;), where his youth is set as a princely life with his foster father Nanda portrayed as a king. Krishna&#x27;s life is closer to that of a human being in &quot;Harivamsa&quot;, but is a symbolic universe in the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, where Krishna is within the universe and beyond it, as well as the universe itself, always. The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; manuscripts also exist in many versions, in numerous Indian languages.

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is considered as the incarnation of Krishna in Gaudiya Vaishnavism and by the ISKCON community.

== Proposed datings and historicity ==

The date of Krishna&#x27;s birth is celebrated every year as Janmashtami.

According to Guy Beck, &quot;most scholars of Hinduism and Indian history accept the historicity of Krishnathat he was a real male person, whether human or divine, who lived on Indian soil by at least 1000 BCE and interacted with many other historical persons within the cycles of the epic and puranic histories.&quot; Yet, Beck also notes that there is an &quot;enormous number of contradictions and discrepancies surrounding the chronology of Krishna&#x27;s life as depicted in the Sanskrit canon&quot;.

Some scholars believe that, among others, the detailed description of Krishna&#x27;s peace mission in the 5th Book of the Mahabharata (Udyogaparvan) is likely to be based on real events. The epic&#x27;s translator J.A.B. van Buitenen in this context assumes “that there was some degree of verisimilitude in the Mahabharata’s depictions of life.”

== Philosophy and theology ==
A wide range of theological and philosophical ideas are presented through Krishna in Hindu texts. The teachings of the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; can be considered, according to Friedhelm Hardy, as the first Krishnaite system of theology.

Ramanuja, a Hindu theologian and philosopher whose works were influential in Bhakti movement, presented him in terms of qualified monism, or nondualism (namely Vishishtadvaita school). Madhvacharya, a philosopher whose works led to the founding of Haridasa tradition of Vaishnavism, presented Krishna in the framework of dualism (Dvaita). Bhedabhedaa group of schools, which teaches that the individual self is both different and not different from the ultimate realitypredates the positions of monism and dualism. Among medieval Bhedabheda thinkers are Nimbarkacharya, who founded the Kumara Sampradaya (Dvaitadvaita philosophical school), and Jiva Goswami, a saint from Gaudiya Vaishnava school, who described Krishna theology in terms of Bhakti yoga and Achintya Bheda Abheda. Krishna theology is presented in a pure monism (&quot;Shuddhadvaita&quot;) framework by Vallabha Acharya, the founder of Pushti sect of Vaishnavism. Madhusudana Sarasvati, an India philosopher, presented Krishna theology in nondualism-monism framework (Advaita Vedanta), while Adi Shankara, credited with unifying and establishing the main currents of thought in Hinduism, mentioned Krishna in his early eighth-century discussions on Panchayatana puja.

The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; synthesizes an Advaita, Samkhya, and Yoga framework for Krishna, but it does so through loving devotion to Krishna. Bryant describes the synthesis of ideas in Bhagavata Purana as:

While Sheridan and Pintchman both affirm Bryant&#x27;s view, the latter adds that the Vedantic view emphasized in the Bhagavata is non-dualist with a difference. In conventional nondual Vedanta, all reality is interconnected and one, the Bhagavata posits that the reality is interconnected and plural.

Across the various theologies and philosophies, the common theme presents Krishna as the essence and symbol of divine love, with human life and love as a reflection of the divine. The longing and love-filled legends of Krishna and the gopis, his playful pranks as a baby, as well as his later dialogues with other figures, are philosophically treated as metaphors for the human longing for the divine and for meaning, and the play between the universals and the human soul. Krishna&#x27;s &quot;lila&quot; is a theology of love-play. According to John Koller, &quot;love is presented not simply as a means to salvation, it is the highest life&quot;. Human love is God&#x27;s love.

Other texts that include Krishna such as the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; have attracted numerous &quot;bhasya&quot; (commentaries) in the Hindu traditions. Though only a part of the Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, it has functioned as an independent spiritual guide. It allegorically raises the ethical and moral dilemmas of human life through Krishna and Arjuna. It then presents a spectrum of answers, addressing the ideological questions on human freedoms, choices, and responsibilities towards self and others. This Krishna dialogue has attracted numerous interpretations, from being a metaphor for inner human struggle that teaches non-violence to being a metaphor for outer human struggle that advocates a rejection of quietism and persecution.

Madhusudana Sarasvati, known for his contributions to classical Advaita Vedanta, was also a devout follower of Krishna and expressed his devotion in various verses within his works, notably in his Bhagavad Gita commentary, Bhagavad Gita Gudarthadipika. In his works, Krishna is often interpreted as representing nirguna Brahman, leading to a transtheistic understanding of deity, where Krishna symbolizes the nondual Self, embodying Being, Consciousness, and Bliss, and the pure Existence underlying all.

== Influence ==
=== Vaishnavism ===
The worship of Krishna is part of Vaishnavism, a major tradition within Hinduism. Krishna is considered a full avatar of Vishnu, or one with Vishnu himself. However, the exact relationship between Krishna and Vishnu is complex and diverse, with Krishna of Krishnaite sampradayas considered an independent deity and supreme. Vaishnavas accept many incarnations of Vishnu, but Krishna is particularly important. Their theologies are generally centered either on Vishnu or an avatar such as Krishna as supreme. The terms Krishnaism and Vishnuism have sometimes been used to distinguish the two, the former implying that Krishna is the transcendent Supreme Being. Some scholars, as Friedhelm Hardy, do not define Krishnaism as a sub-order or offshoot of Vaishnavism, considering it a parallel and no less ancient current of Hinduism.

All Vaishnava traditions recognise Krishna as the eighth avatar of Vishnu; others identify Krishna with Vishnu, while Krishnaite traditions such as Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Ekasarana Dharma, Mahanam Sampraday, Nimbarka Sampradaya and the Vallabha Sampradaya regard Krishna as the &quot;Svayam Bhagavan&quot;, the original form of Lord or the same as the concept of Brahman in Hinduism. Gitagovinda of Jayadeva considers Krishna to be the supreme lord while the ten incarnations are his forms. Swaminarayan, the founder of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya, also worshipped Krishna as God himself. &quot;Greater Krishnaism&quot; corresponds to the second and dominant phase of Vaishnavism, revolving around the cults of the Vasudeva, Krishna, and Gopala of the late Vedic period. Today the faith has a significant following outside of India as well.

==== Early traditions ====

The deity &quot;Krishna-Vasudeva&quot; (&quot;&quot; &quot;Krishna, the son of Vasudeva Anakadundubhi&quot;) is historically one of the earliest forms of worship in Krishnaism and Vaishnavism. It is believed to be a significant tradition of the early history of Krishna religion in antiquity. Thereafter, there was an amalgamation of various similar traditions. These include ancient Bhagavatism, the cult of Gopala, of &quot;Krishna Govinda&quot; (cow-finding Krishna), of Balakrishna (baby Krishna) and of &quot;Krishna Gopivallabha&quot; (Krishna the lover). According to Andre Couture, the Harivamsa contributed to the synthesis of various figures as aspects of Krishna.

Already in the early Middle Ages, Jagannathism ( Odia Vaishnavism) originated as the cult of the god Jagannath ()an abstract form of Krishna. Jagannathism was a regional temple-centered version of Krishnaism, where Jagannath is understood as a principal god, Purushottama and Para Brahman, but can also be regarded as a non-sectarian syncretic Vaishnavite and all-Hindu cult. According to the &quot;Vishnudharma Purana&quot; ( 4th century), Krishna is woshipped in the form of Purushottama in Odia (Odisha). The notable Jagannath temple in Puri, Odisha has been particularly significant within the tradition since about 800 CE.

=== Bhakti tradition ===

The use of the term bhakti, meaning devotion, is not confined to any one deity. However, Krishna is an important and popular focus of the devotionalism tradition within Hinduism, particularly among the Vaishnava Krishnaite sects. Devotees of Krishna subscribe to the concept of &quot;lila&quot;, meaning &#x27;divine play&#x27;, as the central principle of the universe. It is a form of bhakti yoga, one of three types of yoga discussed by Krishna in the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;.

==== Indian subcontinent ====
The bhakti movements devoted to Krishna became prominent in southern India in the 7th to 9thcenturies CE. The earliest works included those of the Alvar saints of Tamil Nadu. A major collection of their works is the &quot;Divya Prabandham&quot;. Alvar Andal&#x27;s popular collection of songs Tiruppavai, in which she conceives of herself as a gopi, is the most famous of the oldest works in this genre.

The movement originated in South India during the 7th century CE, spreading northwards from Tamil Nadu through Karnataka and Maharashtra; by the 15thcentury, it was established in Bengal and northern India. Early Krishnaite Bhakti pioneers included Nimbarkacharya (7thcentury CE), and his disciple Srinivasacharya but most emerged later, including Vallabhacharya (15thcentury CE) and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. They started their own schools, namely Nimbarka Sampradaya, Vallabha Sampradaya, and Gaudiya Vaishnavism, with Krishna and Radha as the supreme gods. In addition, since the 15th century, flourished Tantric variety of Krishnaism, Vaishnava-Sahajiya, is linked to the Bengali poet Chandidas.

In the Deccan, particularly in Maharashtra, saint poets of the Warkari sect such as Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Janabai, Eknath, and Tukaram promoted the worship of Vithoba, a local form of Krishna, from the 13th to 18th century. Before the Warkari tradition, Krishna devotion became well established in Maharashtra due to the rise of the Mahanubhava Sampradaya founded by Sarvajna Chakradhara. The Pranami Sampradaya emerged in the 17th century in Gujarat, based on the Krishna-focussed syncretist Hindu-Islamic teachings of Devchandra Maharaj and his famous successor, Mahamati Prannath. In southern India, Purandara Dasa and Kanakadasa of Karnataka composed songs devoted to the Krishna image of Udupi. Rupa Goswami of Gaudiya Vaishnavism has compiled a comprehensive summary of bhakti called Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu.

In South India, the acharyas of the Sri Sampradaya have written reverently about Krishna in most of their works, including the &quot;Tiruppavai&quot; by Andal and &quot;Gopalavimshati&quot; by Vedanta Desika.

Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Kerala states have many major Krishna temples, and Janmashtami is one of the widely celebrated festivals in South India.

==== Outside Asia ====

By 1965, the &quot;Krishna-bhakti&quot; movement had spread outside India after Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (as instructed by his guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura) travelled from his homeland in West Bengal to New York City. A year later, in 1966, after gaining many followers, he was able to form the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), popularly known as the Hare Krishna movement. The purpose of this movement was to write about Krishna in English and to share the Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy with people in the Western world by spreading the teachings of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. In the biographies of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the mantra he received when he was given diksha or initiation in Gaya was the six-word verse of the &quot;Kali-Santarana Upanishad&quot;, namely &quot;Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare; Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare&quot;. In the Gaudiya tradition, it is the &quot;maha-mantra&quot;, or great mantra, about Krishna bhakti. Its chanting was known as &quot;hari-nama sankirtana&quot;.

The &quot;maha-mantra&quot; gained the attention of George Harrison and John Lennon of the Beatles fame, and Harrison produced a 1969 recording of the mantra by devotees from the London Radha Krishna Temple. Titled &quot;Hare Krishna Mantra&quot;, the song reached the top twenty on the UK music charts and was also successful in West Germany and Czechoslovakia. The mantra of the Upanishad thus helped bring Bhaktivedanta and ISKCON ideas about Krishna into the West. ISKCON has built many Krishna temples in the West, as well as other locations such as South Africa.

=== Southeast Asia ===

Krishna is found in Southeast Asian history and art, but to a far lesser extent than Shiva, Durga, Nandi, Agastya, and Buddha. In temples (&quot;candi&quot;) of the archaeological sites in hilly volcanic Java, Indonesia, temple reliefs do not portray his pastoral life or his role as the erotic lover, nor do the historic Javanese Hindu texts. Rather, either his childhood or the life as a king and Arjuna&#x27;s companion have been more favored. The most elaborate temple arts of Krishna is found in a series of &quot;Krsnayana&quot; reliefs in the Prambanan Hindu temple complex near Yogyakarta. These are dated to the 9thcentury CE. Krishna remained a part of the Javanese cultural and theological fabric through the 14thcentury, as evidenced by the 14th-century Penataran reliefs along with those of the Hindu god Rama in east Java, before Islam replaced Buddhism and Hinduism on the island.

The medieval era arts of Vietnam and Cambodia feature Krishna. The earliest surviving sculptures and reliefs are from the 6th and 7thcenturies, and these include Vaishnavism iconography. According to John Guy, the curator and director of Southeast Asian arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Krishna Govardhana art from 6th/7th-century Vietnam at Danang, and 7th-century Cambodia at Phnom Da cave in Angkor Borei, are some of the most sophisticated of this era.

Krishna&#x27;s iconography has also been found in Thailand, along with those of Surya and Vishnu. For example, a large number of sculptures and icons have been found in the SiThep and Klangnai sites in the Phetchabun region of northern Thailand. These are dated to about the 7th and 8thcenturies, from both the Funan and Zhenla period archaeological sites.

== Performance arts ==
=== Dance and culture ===

Indian dance and music theatre traces its origins and techniques to the ancient &quot;Sama Veda&quot; and &quot;Natyasastra&quot; texts. The stories enacted and the numerous choreographic themes are inspired by the legends in Hindu texts, including Krishna-related literature such as &quot;Harivamsa&quot; and &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;.

The Krishna stories have played a key role in the history of Indian theatre, music, and dance, particularly through the tradition of &quot;Rasaleela&quot;. These are dramatic enactments of Krishna&#x27;s childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. One common scene involves Krishna playing flute in Rasa Leela, only to be heard by certain gopis (cowherd maidens), which is theologically supposed to represent divine call only heard by certain enlightened beings. Some of the text&#x27;s legends have inspired secondary theatre literature such as the eroticism in Gita Govinda.

Krishna-related literature such as the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; accords a metaphysical significance to the performances and treats them as a religious ritual, infusing daily life with spiritual meaning, thus representing a good, honest, happy life. Similarly, Krishna-inspired performances aim to cleanse the hearts of faithful actors and listeners. Singing, dancing, and performing any part of &quot;Krishna Lila&quot; is an act of remembering the dharma in the text, as a form of &quot;para bhakti&quot; (supreme devotion). To remember Krishna at any time and in any art, asserts the text, is to worship the good and the divine.

Classical dance styles such as Kathak, Odissi, Manipuri, Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam in particular are known for their Krishna-related performances. Krisnattam (Krishnattam) traces its origins to Krishna legends, and is linked to another major classical Indian dance form called Kathakali. Bryant summarizes the influence of Krishna stories in the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; as, &quot;[it] has inspired more derivative literature, poetry, drama, dance, theatre and art than any other text in the history of Sanskrit literature, with the possible exception of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;.

The Palliyodam, a type of large boat built and used by Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple in Kerala for the annual water processions of Uthrattathi Jalamela and Valla Sadhya has the legend that it was designed by Krishna and were made to look like Sheshanaga, the serpent on which Vishnu rests.

=== Jainism ===
The Jainism tradition lists 63 &quot;Śalākāpuruṣa&quot; or notable figures which, amongst others, includes the twenty-four &quot;Tirthankaras&quot; (spiritual teachers) and nine sets of triads. One of these triads is Krishna as the &quot;Vasudeva&quot;, Balarama as the &quot;Baladeva&quot;, and Jarasandha as the &quot;Prati-Vasudeva&quot;. In each age of the Jain cyclic time is born a &quot;Vasudeva&quot; with an elder brother termed the &quot;Baladeva&quot;. Between the triads, &quot;Baladeva&quot; upholds the principle of non-violence, a central idea of Jainism. The villain is the &quot;Prati-vasudeva&quot;, who attempts to destroy the world. To save the world, &quot;Vasudeva-Krishna&quot; has to forsake the non-violence principle and kill the &quot;Prati-Vasudeva&quot;. The stories of these triads can be found in the &quot;Harivamsa Purana&quot; (8thcentury CE) of Jinasena (not be confused with its namesake, the addendum to &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;) and the &quot;Trishashti-shalakapurusha-charita&quot; of Hemachandra.

The story of Krishna&#x27;s life in the &quot;Puranas&quot; of Jainism follows the same general outline as those in the Hindu texts, but in details, they are very different: they include Jain &quot;Tirthankaras&quot; as figures in the story, and generally are polemically critical of Krishna, unlike the versions found in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, and the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;. For example, Krishna loses battles in the Jain versions, and his &quot;gopis&quot; and his clan of Yadavas die in a fire created by an ascetic named Dvaipayana. Similarly, after dying from the hunter Jara&#x27;s arrow, the Jaina texts state Krishna goes to the third hell in Jain cosmology, while his brother is said to go to the sixth heaven.

Vimalasuri is attributed to be the author of the Jain version of the &quot;Harivamsa Purana&quot;, but no manuscripts have been found that confirm this. It is likely that later Jain scholars, probably Jinasena of the 8thcentury, wrote a complete version of Krishna legends in the Jain tradition and credited it to the ancient Vimalasuri. Partial and older versions of the Krishna story are available in Jain literature, such as in the &quot;Antagata Dasao&quot; of the &quot;Svetambara&quot; &quot;Agama&quot; tradition.

In other Jain texts, Krishna is stated to be a cousin of the twenty-second &quot;Tirthankara&quot;, Neminatha. The Jain texts state that Neminatha taught Krishna all the wisdom that he later gave to Arjuna in the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;. According to Jeffery D. Long, a professor of religion known for his publications on Jainism, this connection between Krishna and Neminatha has been a historic reason for Jains to accept, read, and cite the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; as a spiritually important text, celebrate Krishna-related festivals, and intermingle with Hindus as spiritual cousins.

=== Buddhism ===

The story of Krishna occurs in the Jataka tales in Buddhism. The &quot;Vidhurapandita Jataka&quot; mentions &quot;Madhura&quot; (Sanskrit: Mathura), the &quot;Ghata Jataka&quot; mentions Kamsa, Devagabbha (Sk: Devaki), Upasagara or Vasudeva, Govaddhana (Sk: Govardhana), Baladeva (Balarama), and Kanha or Kesava (Sk: Krishna, Keshava).

Like the Jain versions of the Krishna legends, the Buddhist versions such as one in &quot;Ghata Jataka&quot; follow the general outline of the story, but are different from the Hindu versions as well. For example, the Buddhist legend describes Devagabbha (Devaki) to have been isolated in a palace built upon a pole after she is born, so no future husband could reach her. Krishna&#x27;s father similarly is described as a powerful king, but who meets up with Devagabbha anyway, and to whom Kamsa gives away his sister Devagabbha in marriage. The siblings of Krishna are not killed by Kamsa, though he tries. In the Buddhist version of the legend, all of Krishna&#x27;s siblings grow to maturity.

Krishna and his siblings&#x27; capital becomes Dvaravati. The Arjuna and Krishna interaction is missing in the Jataka version. A new legend is included, wherein Krishna laments in uncontrollable sorrow when his son dies, and a Ghatapandita feigns madness to teach Krishna a lesson. The Jataka tale also includes internecine destruction among his siblings after they all get drunk. Krishna also dies in the Buddhist legend by the hand of a hunter named Jara, but while he is traveling to a frontier city. Mistaking Krishna for a pig, Jara throws a spear that fatally pierces his feet, causing Krishna great pain and then his death.

At the end of this &quot;Ghata-Jataka&quot; discourse, the Buddhist text declares that Sariputta, one of the revered disciples of the Buddha in the Buddhist tradition, was incarnated as Krishna in his previous life to learn lessons on grief from the Buddha in his prior rebirth:

While the Buddhist Jataka texts co-opt Krishna-Vasudeva and make him a student of the Buddha in his previous life, the Hindu texts co-opt the Buddha and make him an avatar of Vishnu. In Chinese Buddhism, Taoism and Chinese folk religion, the figure of Krishna has been amalgamated and merged with that of Nalakuvara to influence the formation of the god Nezha, who has taken on iconographic characteristics of Krishna such as being presented as a divine god-child and slaying a nāga in his youth.

Krishna&#x27;s life is written about in &quot;Krishna Avtar&quot; of the &quot;Chaubis Avtar&quot;, a composition in Dasam Granth traditionally and historically attributed to Sikh Guru Gobind Singh.

Within the Sikh-derived 19th-century Radha Soami movement, the followers of its founder Shiv Dayal Singh used to consider him the Living Master and incarnation of God (Krishna/Vishnu).

Baháʼís believe that Krishna was a &quot;Manifestation of God&quot;, or one in a line of prophets who have revealed the Word of God progressively for a gradually maturing humanity. In this way, Krishna shares an exalted station with Abraham, Moses, Zoroaster, Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, the Báb, and the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh.

Ahmadiyya, a 20th-century Islamic movement, consider Krishna as one of their ancient prophets. Ghulam Ahmad stated that he was himself a prophet in the likeness of prophets such as Krishna, Jesus, and Muhammad, who had come to earth as a latter-day reviver of religion and morality.

Krishna worship or reverence has been adopted by several new religious movements since the 19thcentury, and he is sometimes a member of an eclectic pantheon in occult texts, along with Greek, Buddhist, biblical, and even historical figures. For instance, Édouard Schuré, an influential figure in perennial philosophy and occult movements, considered Krishna a &quot;Great Initiate&quot;, while Theosophists regard Krishna as an incarnation of Maitreya (one of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom), the most important spiritual teacher for humanity along with Buddha.

Krishna was canonised by Aleister Crowley and is recognised as a saint of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica in the Gnostic Mass of Ordo Templi Orientis.

<text>Amiga demos are demos created for the Amiga home computer.

A &quot;demo&quot; is a demonstration of the multimedia capabilities of a computer (or more to the point, a demonstration of the skill of the demo&#x27;s constructors). There was intense rivalry during the 1990s among the best programmers, graphic artists and computer musicians to continually outdo each other&#x27;s demos. Since the Amiga&#x27;s hardware was more or less fixed (unlike today&#x27;s PC industry, where arbitrary combinations of hardware can be put together), there was competition to test the limits of that hardware and perform theoretically &quot;impossible&quot; feats by refactoring the problem at hand. In Europe the Amiga was the undisputed leader of mainstream multimedia computing in the late 1980s and early 1990s, though it was eventually overtaken by PC architecture.

Some Amiga demos, such as the RSI Megademo, Kefrens Megademo VIII or Crionics &amp; The Silents &quot;Hardwired&quot; are considered seminal works in the demo field. New Amiga demos are released even today, although the demo scene has firmly moved onto PC hardware. Many Amiga game developers were active in the demo scene.

The demo scene spearheaded development in multimedia programming techniques for the Amiga, such that it was de rigueur for the latest visual tricks, soundtrackers and 3D algorithms from the demo scene to end up being used in computer game development.

==Demo software==
Most demos were written in 68000 assembly language, although a few were written in C and other languages. To utilize full hardware performance, Amiga demos were optimized and written entirely for one purpose in assembly (avoiding generic and portable code). Additional performance was achieved by utilizing several coprocessors, including a blitter, in parallel with the 68000. Most demos bypassed the operating system and addressed the hardware directly.

First bigger demos were released in 1987, one of them was &quot;Tech Tech&quot; by Sodan &amp; Magician 42, it was released in November 1987 and is considered a classic by many.

Eric Schwartz produced a series of animated demos that ran with MoviePlayer, an animation software package similar to Toon Boom. The animated demos drew heavily on the whimsy and graphic style of comic strips.

Red Sector Incorporated produced a piece of software called the RSI Demomaker, which allowed users to script their own demos, replete with scrolltext, vectorballs, plasma screens, etc.

Full demos range from under 128 KB to several megabytes. There have been several thousand demos produced in many countries. Some active demo countries were Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, UK, Poland and others.

==Intros==
Smaller demos are often known as &quot;intros&quot;. They are typically limited to between 4 and 64KB in size. Intros were originally used as &quot;tags&quot; by cracking groups on computer games and other software. The purpose of the intro was to advertise cracking and distribution skill of a particular group. Later it developed into a stand-alone art form. Many demo and intro groups disassociated themselves from the cracking and copying scene, although the same people could still be involved in it.

==Ripping==
The Amiga thrived on public domain, freeware and other not-for-profit development. The architecture provided no substantial mechanism for protecting software from inspection. In order to read the memory one simply performed a hot reset (which preserved the contents of RAM) and then booted to a dedicated floppy disk that could inspect and dump the memory&#x27;s contents. It was therefore common for developers and hackers to &quot;rip&quot; music, graphics and code and then reuse it in their own productions. This led to intense competition in certain fields, for example, in the development of sound tracking software and &quot;Tetris&quot; clones, with each group of developers trying to outdo the current state of the art. In fact, some demos even featured their source code as part of the executable to save hackers the trouble of disassembly, though it came strewn with incendiary comments for those who would seek to improve on it.

<text>The Best Years of Our Lives (also known as Glory for Me and Home Again) is a 1946 American drama film directed by William Wyler and starring Myrna Loy, Fredric March, Dana Andrews, Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo and Harold Russell. The film is about three United States servicemen re-adjusting to societal changes and civilian life after coming home from World War II. The three men come from different services with different ranks that do not correspond with their civilian social class backgrounds. It is one of the earliest films to address issues encountered by returning veterans in the post World War II era.

The film was a critical and commercial success. It won 7 Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director (William Wyler), Best Actor (Fredric March), Best Supporting Actor (Harold Russell), Best Film Editing (Daniel Mandell), Best Adapted Screenplay (Robert E. Sherwood), and Best Original Score (Hugo Friedhofer).

In addition, Russell was also awarded an honorary Academy Award, the only time in history that two such awards were given for a single performance.

It was the highest-grossing film in both the United States and United Kingdom since the release of &quot;Gone with the Wind,&quot; and is the sixth most-attended film of all time in the United Kingdom, with over 20 million tickets sold.

In 1989, &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Three returning World War II veterans meet on a flight to their midwestern hometown of Boone City: USAAF bombardier captain Fred Derry, U.S. Navy petty officer Homer Parrish, and U.S. Army sergeant Al Stephenson. Each had left a very different life behind:

Fred Derry was a drug store soda jerk who lived with his parents on the wrong side of the tracks. Before shipping out, Fred married a gold-digger named Marie after a whirlwind romance. Marie has since been working in a nightclub to fill her time (and her nightlife) in spite of Fred&#x27;s generous combat pay as an Air Force officer.

Al Stephenson was an executive at a bank and lived in a luxury apartment with his wife, Milly, and their teenage children, Peggy and Rob.

Homer Parrish was a star high school athlete living with his middle-class parents and younger sister. Homer had also been dating his next-door neighbor Wilma, whom he intended to marry upon his return from the war.

Each man faces challenges integrating back into civilian life. Homer lost both hands in the war and though he has become functional in the use of his mechanical hooks, he cannot believe that Wilma will still want to marry him. Al, tired and jaded from the war, returns to the bank and is given a promotion, but wrestles with alcohol. Though highly decorated, Fred suffers from PTSD flashbacks by night.

Fred arrives home and cannot locate his party girl wife, who does not expect him. The Stephensons and their daughter Peggy invite Fred along with them for the evening, bar hopping in celebration of Al&#x27;s return. An inebriated Fred keeps asking Peggy who she is, and she reminds him that she is &quot;Al&#x27;s daughter.&quot; When Fred is unable to get into his apartment, the Stephensons offer him a bed for the night. Later, Peggy calms Fred during a nightmare, and the two gradually become attracted to each other. When Peggy and her boyfriend invite Fred and Marie out to dinner, Peggy realizes how shallow and materialistic Marie is and becomes determined to break up her and Fred&#x27;s marriage.

Although proficient in managing the challenges of his disability, Homer is frustrated by his loss of independence and adjusting to his relationship with Wilma. Concerned that Wilma does not fully understand the difficulties of being married to him with his disabilities, Homer demonstrates to her how she will need to assist him at bedtime when he removes his harness with his prosthetic hands, leaving him helpless. Wilma reaffirms her love for Homer and says she can commit herself to him for life.

Al continues to struggle with re-entry into civilian life. Widely respected by the bank&#x27;s senior management for his past business acumen, Al is criticized after approving an unsecured loan to a farmer and fellow veteran who wants to buy forty acres, but has no collateral. With inhibitions lowered by excessive drinking, Al gives a speech at a work banquet that satirizes requiring a veteran to provide collateral before risking his life to take a hill in battle.

With little work experience and unable to find a better job than soda jerk, Fred returns to the same drugstore. Fred and Peggy&#x27;s attraction grows stronger, which puts Fred at odds with Al. When Homer visits Fred at the drugstore, another customer criticizes US involvement in the war, telling Homer his injuries were unnecessary. Homer responds angrily, and Fred intervenes on his behalf, punching the customer and consequently being fired. Meanwhile, Marie, frustrated with Fred&#x27;s lack of financial success and missing her past nightlife, decides to get a divorce.

Bitter and seeing no future in Boone City, particularly with Al telling him to stay away from Peggy, Fred decides to catch the next plane out. While waiting at the airport, Fred walks into an aircraft boneyard, climbing into a decommissioned B-17 bomber. Sitting in the bombardier&#x27;s seat, Fred has another flashback. He is roused out of his stressful memories by a work crew foreman, who tells him the planes are being demolished for use in the growing prefab housing industry. Fred asks if they need help in the budding business and is hired.

Al, Milly, and Peggy attend Homer and Wilma&#x27;s wedding, where Fred is best man. Now divorced, Fred reunites with Peggy after the ceremony. Fred expresses his love but says things may be financially difficult if she stays with him. Peggy&#x27;s smile expresses her joy and she and Fred kiss.

==Cast==

Casting brought together established stars as well as character actors and relative unknowns. Jazz drummer Gene Krupa was seen in archival footage, while Tennessee Ernie Ford, later a TV star, appeared as an uncredited &quot;hillbilly singer&quot; (in the first of his only three film appearances).

Blake Edwards, later a film producer and director, appeared fleetingly as an uncredited &quot;Corporal&quot;. Wyler&#x27;s daughters, Catherine and Judy, were cast as uncredited customers seen in the drug store where Fred Derry works. Sean Penn&#x27;s father, Leo, played the uncredited part of the soldier working as a scheduling clerk in the Air Transport Command Office at the beginning of the film.

Teresa Wright was only 13 years younger than her on-screen mother, played by Myrna Loy.

Michael Hall (1926–2020) played Fredric March&#x27;s son and was the last surviving credited cast member at the time of his death. However, he is never seen after the first third of the film. Hall&#x27;s contract with Goldwyn ended during filming, but the producer was reluctant to pay extra money to rehire him.

==Production==
Samuel Goldwyn was inspired to produce a film about veterans after reading an August 7, 1944, article in &quot;Time&quot; about the difficulties experienced by men returning to civilian life. Goldwyn hired former war correspondent MacKinlay Kantor to write a screenplay. His work was first published as a novella, &quot;Glory for Me&quot;, which Kantor wrote in blank verse. Robert E. Sherwood then adapted the novella as a screenplay.

Director Wyler had flown combat missions over Europe in filming &quot;Memphis Belle&quot; (1944), and worked hard to get accurate depictions of the combat veterans he had encountered. Wyler changed the original casting, which had featured a veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and sought out Harold Russell, a non-actor, to take on the exacting role of Homer Parrish.

For &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;, he asked the principal actors to purchase their own clothes, in order to connect with daily life and produce an authentic feeling. Other Wyler touches included constructing life-size sets, which went against the standard larger sets that were more suited to camera positions. The impact for the audience was immediate, as each scene played out in a realistic, natural way.

Recounting the interrelated story of three veterans right after the end of World War II, &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; began filming just over seven months after the war&#x27;s end, starting on April 15, 1946, at a variety of locations, including the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden, Ontario International Airport in Ontario, California, Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, and the Samuel Goldwyn/Warner Hollywood Studios.

In &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; cinematographer Gregg Toland used deep focus photography, in which objects both close to and distant from the camera are in sharp focus. For the passage of Fred Derry&#x27;s reliving a combat mission while sitting in the remains of a former bomber, Wyler used &quot;zoom&quot; effects to simulate Derry&#x27;s subjective state.

The fictional Boone City was patterned after Cincinnati, Ohio. The &quot;Jackson High&quot; football stadium seen early in aerial footage of the bomber flying over the Boone City is Corcoran Stadium located at Xavier University in Cincinnati. A few seconds later Walnut Hills High School with its dome and football field can be seen along with the downtown Cincinnati skyline (Carew Tower and Fourth and Vine Tower) in the background.

After the war, the combat aircraft featured in the film were being destroyed and disassembled for reuse as scrap material. The scene of Derry&#x27;s walking among aircraft ruins was filmed at the Ontario Army Air Field in Ontario, California. The former training facility had been converted into a scrap yard, housing nearly 2,000 former combat aircraft in various states of disassembly and reclamation.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Upon its release, &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; received extremely positive reviews from critics. Shortly after its premiere at the Astor Theater, New York, Bosley Crowther, film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, hailed the film as a masterpiece. He wrote,

French film critic André Bazin used examples of Toland&#x27;s and Wyler&#x27;s deep-focus visual style to illuminate his theory of realism in filmgoing into detail about the scene in which Fred uses the phone booth in the far background while Homer and Butch play piano in the foreground. Bazin explains how deep focus functions in this scene:
Professor and author Gabriel Miller discusses briefly the use of deep-focus in both the bar scene and the wedding scene at the end of the picture in an article written for the National Film Preservation Board.

Several decades later, film critic David Thomson offered tempered praise: &quot;I would concede that &quot;Best Years&quot; is decent and humane... acutely observed, despite being so meticulous a package. It would have taken uncommon genius and daring at that time to sneak a view of an untidy or unresolved America past Goldwyn or the public.&quot;

&quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; has a 97% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating at Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.9/10, based on 97 reviews. The critical consensus states: &quot;An engrossing look at the triumphs and travails of war veterans, &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; is concerned specifically with the aftermath of World War II, but its messages speak to the overall American experience.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 93 out of 100 based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert put the film on his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list in 2007, calling it &quot;... modern, lean, and honest&quot;.
===Popular response===
&quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; was a massive commercial success, not only becoming the highest-grossing film of 1946 but the entire 1940s decade.

It opened to the public at the Astor Theatre in New York City on November 22, 1947, and grossed $52,236 in its first week. Its length restricted the film to six shows a day, cutting down on total ticket sales, and initially suffered by having a top midweek ticket price of $2.40, reducing gross revenue. It opened at the Woods Theatre in Chicago on December 18 before a roadshow theatrical release in Boston and Los Angeles, starting on the evening of Christmas Day. After 12 weeks at the Astor, the film had grossed $584,000 and at that point had grossed $1.37 million from 6 theatres in five cities from 45 play weeks.

The picture earned an estimated $10 million in theatrical rentals at the U.S. and Canadian box office during its initial theatrical run, 
ultimately benefiting from much larger admission prices (reflecting its exceptional length) than the majority of films released that year, which accounted for almost 70% of its earnings. When box office figures are adjusted for inflation, it remains one of the top 100 grossing films in U.S. history.

Among films released before 1950, only &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Big Parade&quot; and four Disney titles have done more total business, in part due to later re-releases. (Reliable box office figures for certain early films such as &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; and Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s comedies are unavailable.)

However, because of the distribution arrangement RKO had with Goldwyn, RKO recorded a loss of $660,000 on the film.

==Awards and honors==
In spite of his role, Harold Russell was not a professional actor. As the Academy Board of Governors considered him a long shot to win Best Supporting Actor Oscar he had been nominated for, they gave him an Academy Honorary Award &quot;for bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance&quot;. When Russell in fact won as supporting actor there was an enthusiastic response. He is the only actor to have received two Academy Awards for the same performance. In 1992, Russell sold his Best Supporting Actor statuette at auction for $60,500 ($ today), to pay his wife&#x27;s medical bills.

==Radio adaptations==
The picture received four half-hour radio adaptations during 1947 and 1949: on Hedda Hopper&#x27;s &quot;This Is Hollywood&quot;, &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot; (two) and &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot;. In each case various actors reprised their film roles.

<text>Beaverton is a city in the Tualatin Valley, located in Washington County in the U.S. state of Oregon, with a small portion bordering Portland. The city is among the main cities that make up the Portland metropolitan area. Its population was 97,494 at the 2020 census, making it the second most populous city in the county and the seventh-most populous city in Oregon. Beaverton is an economic center for Washington County along with neighboring Hillsboro.

==History==
===Early settlement===

According to &quot;Oregon Geographic Names&quot;, Beaverton&#x27;s name is derived from the settlement&#x27;s proximity to a large body of water resulting from beaver dams.

The area of Tualatin Valley that became Beaverton was originally the home of a Native American tribe known as the &quot;Atfalati&quot;, which settlers mispronounced as &quot;Tualatin&quot;. The Atfalati population dwindled in the latter part of the 18th century, and the prosperous tribe was no longer dominant in the area by the 19th century when settlers arrived. The tribe named their village Chakeipi, which translates to &quot;place of the beaver&quot;, which early settlers referred to as &quot;Beaverdam.&quot;

Early settlers include the Hall Family from Kentucky, the Denneys who lived on their claim near present-day Scholls Ferry Road and Hall Blvd, and Orin S. Allen, from western New York. Lawrence Hall purchased in Beaverdam in 1847 and built a grist mill with his brother near present-day Walker Road. His was the first land claim in the area. He was soon followed by Thomas Denney in 1848, who came to the area and built its first sawmill. In 1860, a toll plank road from Portland to Beaverton was completed over a trail called Canyon Road.

After the American Civil War, numerous other settlers, including Joshua Welch, George Betts, Charles Angel, W. P. Watson, and John Henry, laid out what is now known as Beaverton hoping they could bring a railroad to an area once described as, &quot;mostly swamps &amp; marshes connected by beaver dams to create what looked like a huge lake.&quot; In 1872, Beaverton&#x27;s first post office opened in a general store operated by Betts, who also served as the first postmaster of the community. Betts Street, where the current post office now stands, is named in honor of him. In 1893, Beaverton, which by that time had a population of 400, was officially incorporated. Alonzo Cady, a local businessman, served as the first mayor. Many major roads in Beaverton are named for these early settlers.

===20th century===
Beaverton was an early home to automobile dealerships. A Ford Motor Company dealership was established there in 1915; it was purchased by Guy Carr in 1923 and over the years Carr expanded it into several locations throughout Beaverton. There are still several dealerships near the intersection of Walker and Canyon Roads.
In the early 1920s, Beaverton was home to Premium Picture Productions, a movie studio which produced about fifteen films. The studio site was later converted into Watt&#x27;s Field and associated aircraft manufacturing facilities. A second Beaverton airport, Bernard&#x27;s Airport, was later developed farther north, at the present location of the Cedar Hills Crossing mall.

The town&#x27;s first library opened in 1925. Originally on the second floor of the Cady building, it has been moved repeatedly; in 2000 it was moved to its current location on Hall Boulevard and 5th Street. A branch location was opened for the first time in June 2010, when the Murray-Scholls location opened near the Murrayhill neighborhood. The Beaverton libraries and 15 other local libraries participate in the Washington County Cooperative Library Services.

===21st century=== 
In December 2004, the city and Washington County announced an &quot;interim plan&quot; which would lead to Beaverton becoming the second-largest city in Oregon, second only to Portland. The &quot;interim&quot; plan actually covered a period of more than ten years; from the county&#x27;s perspective, the plan supported its strategy of having cities and special districts provide urban services. The city of Beaverton also attempted to annex certain businesses, including Nike, which responded with a legal and lobbying effort to resist the annexation. The lobbying effort succeeded quickly, with the Oregon Legislative Assembly enacting Senate Bill 887, which prohibited Beaverton from annexing Nike without the company&#x27;s consent. The bill also applied to property owned by Electro Scientific Industries, Columbia Sportswear, and Tektronix, and in August 2008 the Oregon Land Use Board of Appeals ruled that the bill also barred the city from annexing property belonging to Leupold &amp; Stevens. (See below, under Economy.) Beaverton&#x27;s legal efforts to annex Nike cost the city over one million dollars.

The Oregon State Legislature has also passed legislation which redetermined Washington County&#x27;s urban growth boundary to include more development. In 2018, the Metro Council voted to once again expand the urban growth boundary to include the Cooper Mountain urban reserve area.

In 2016, voters approved a $35 million bond for a new Public Safety Center built to withstand a major earthquake. The center, which opened in fall of 2020, now houses the city&#x27;s Emergency Management and Police Departments. Construction began in September 2018.

The city has tried to encourage transit-oriented development around the city&#x27;s MAX Light Rail stations. The Round, a mixed-use development around Beaverton Central MAX Station on the site of a former sewer plant, was announced in 1996. In 2014, the City of Beaverton moved its city hall into The Beaverton Building, an office building in The Round. The Round currently consists of 24,000 square foot of retail space with 63 residential condominiums located above. BG&#x27;s Food Cartel, Beaverton&#x27;s first food cart pod, opened in 2018 and has 31 food carts, a speakeasy bar, and an event venue. Adjacent to The Round, the 550 seat Patricia Reser Center for the Arts opened in 2022, and was made possible by pledges from the Beaverton Arts Foundation and Pat Reser along with public sources. The groundbreaking was performed on November 13, 2019. In addition to the Reser Center, a new 125-room hotel opened next to The Round in February 2021. The performing arts center, apartments, city hall, hotel, MAX light rail station, plazas, food carts, and nearby businesses are collectively known as Downtown Beaverton.

Beaverton is served by transit bus, commuter rail, and light rail services operated by the Portland metropolitan area&#x27;s regional transit agency, TriMet. MAX Light Rail serves the city with seven light rail stations; from west to east, they are: , , , , , Beaverton Transit Center, and Sunset Transit Center. The MAX Blue Line serves all seven stations while the MAX Red Line serves only Beaverton Transit Center and Sunset Transit Center.

Intercity bus services with stops in Beaverton include POINT and TCTD.

Oregon Electric and Red Electric interurban lines once served the city in the early 20th century. In the 1940s, Tualatin Valley Stages, a division of Portland Stages, Inc., provided limited bus transit service between the city and downtown Portland; it operated later as a separate company, Tualatin Valley Buses, Inc., through the 1960s. This was one of four privately owned bus companies that served the Portland metropolitan area and were collectively known as the &quot;Blue Bus&quot; lines. All four companies were replaced in 1970 by TriMet, which expanded bus service to cover more areas of Beaverton.

The city is the location of a major freeway interchange for U.S. Route 26 (US 26; Sunset Highway) and Oregon Route 217 (OR 217). The Sunset Highway connects Beaverton to Hillsboro and the Oregon Coast to the west and Portland to the east. OR 217 travels from Beaverton south through Tigard and terminates at an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5).

<text>A security is a tradable financial asset. The term commonly refers to any form of financial instrument, but its legal definition varies by jurisdiction. In some countries and languages people commonly use the term &quot;security&quot; to refer to any form of financial instrument, even though the underlying legal and regulatory regime may not have such a broad definition. In some jurisdictions the term specifically excludes financial instruments other than equity and fixed income instruments. In some jurisdictions it includes some instruments that are close to equities and fixed income, e.g., equity warrants.

Securities may be represented by a certificate or, more typically, they may be &quot;non-certificated&quot;, that is in electronic (dematerialized) or &quot;book entry only&quot; form. Certificates may be &quot;bearer&quot;, meaning they entitle the holder to rights under the security merely by holding the security, or &quot;registered&quot;, meaning they entitle the holder to rights only if they appear on a security register maintained by the issuer or an intermediary. They include shares of corporate capital stock or mutual funds, bonds issued by corporations or governmental agencies, stock options or other options, limited partnership units, and various other formal investment instruments that are negotiable and fungible.

== United Kingdom and United States ==
In the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority functions as the national competent authority for the regulation of financial markets; the definition in its &quot;Handbook&quot; of the term &quot;security&quot; applies only to equities, debentures, alternative debentures, government and public securities, warrants, certificates representing certain securities, units, stakeholder pension schemes, personal pension schemes, rights to or interests in investments, and anything that may be admitted to the Official List.

In the United States, a &quot;security&quot; is a tradable financial asset of any kind. Securities can be broadly categorized into:

* Debt securities (e.g., banknotes, bonds, and debentures)
* Equity securities (e.g., common stocks)
* Derivatives (e.g., forwards, futures, options, and swaps).

The company or other entity issuing the security is called the issuer. A country&#x27;s regulatory structure determines what qualifies as a security. For example, private investment pools may have some features of securities, but they may not be registered or regulated as such if they meet various restrictions.

Securities are the traditional method used by commercial enterprises to raise new capital. They may offer an attractive alternative to bank loans - depending on their pricing and market demand for particular characteristics. A disadvantage of bank loans as a source of financing is that the bank may seek a measure of protection against default by the borrower via extensive financial covenants. Through securities, capital is provided by investors who purchase the securities upon their initial issuance. In a similar way, a government may issue securities when it chooses to increase government debt.

== Debt and equity ==
Securities are traditionally divided into debt securities and equities.

=== Debt ===
Debt securities may be called debentures, bonds, deposits, notes or commercial paper depending on their maturity, collateral and other characteristics. The holder of a debt security is typically entitled to the payment of principal and interest, together with other contractual rights under the terms of the issue, such as the right to receive certain information. Debt securities are generally issued for a fixed term and redeemable by the issuer at the end of that term. Debt securities may be protected by collateral or may be unsecured, and, if they are unsecured, may be contractually &quot;senior&quot; to other unsecured debt meaning their holders would have a priority in a bankruptcy of the issuer. Debt that is not senior is &quot;subordinated&quot;.

Corporate bonds represent the debt of commercial or industrial entities. Debentures have a long maturity, typically at least ten years, whereas notes have a shorter maturity. Commercial paper is a simple form of debt security that essentially represents a post-dated cheque with a maturity of not more than 270 days.

Money market instruments are short term debt instruments that may have characteristics of deposit accounts, such as certificates of deposit, Accelerated Return Notes (ARN), and certain bills of exchange. They are highly liquid and are sometimes referred to as &quot;near cash&quot;. Commercial paper is also often highly liquid.

Euro debt securities are securities issued internationally outside their domestic market in a denomination different from that of the issuer&#x27;s domicile. They include eurobonds and euronotes. Eurobonds are characteristically underwritten, and not secured, and interest is paid gross. A euronote may take the form of euro-commercial paper (ECP) or euro-certificates of deposit.

Government bonds are medium or long term debt securities issued by sovereign governments or their agencies. Typically they carry a lower rate of interest than corporate bonds, and serve as a source of finance for governments. U.S. federal government bonds are called &quot;treasuries.&quot; Because of their liquidity and perceived low risk, treasuries are used to manage the money supply in the open market operations of non-US central banks.

Sub-sovereign government bonds, known in the U.S. as municipal bonds, represent the debt of state, provincial, territorial, municipal or other governmental units other than sovereign governments.

Supranational bonds represent the debt of international organizations such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, regional multilateral development banks like the African Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank, and others.

=== Equity ===
An equity security is a share of equity interest in an entity such as the capital stock of a company, trust or partnership. The most common form of equity interest is common stock, although preferred equity is also a form of capital stock. The holder of an equity is a shareholder, owning a share, or fractional part of the issuer. Unlike debt securities, which typically require regular payments (interest) to the holder, equity securities are not entitled to any payment. In bankruptcy, they share only in the residual interest of the issuer after all obligations have been paid out to creditors. However, equity generally entitles the holder to a pro rata portion of control of the company, meaning that a holder of a majority of the equity is usually entitled to control the issuer. Equity also enjoys the right to profits and capital gain, whereas holders of debt securities receive only interest and repayment of principal regardless of how well the issuer performs financially. Furthermore, debt securities do not have voting rights outside of bankruptcy. In other words, equity holders are entitled to the &quot;upside&quot; of the business and to control the business.

=== Hybrid ===
Hybrid securities combine some of the characteristics of both debt and equity securities.

Preference shares form an intermediate class of security between equities and debt. If the issuer is liquidated, preference shareholders have the right to receive interest or a return of capital prior to ordinary shareholders. However, from a legal perspective, preference shares are capital stocks and therefore may entitle the holders to some degree of control depending on whether they carry voting rights.

Convertibles are bonds or preferred stocks that can be converted, at the election of the holder of the convertibles, into the ordinary shares of the issuing company. The convertibility, however, may be forced if the convertible is a callable bond, and the issuer calls the bond. The bondholder has about one month to convert it, or the company will call the bond by giving the holder the call price, which may be less than the value of the converted stock. This is referred to as a forced conversion.

Equity warrants are options issued by the company that allow the holder of the warrant to purchase a specific number of shares at a specified price within a specified time. They are often issued together with bonds or existing equities, and are, sometimes, detachable from them and separately tradeable. When the holder of the warrant exercises it, he pays the money directly to the company, and the company issues new shares to the holder.

Warrants, like other convertible securities, increases the number of shares outstanding, and are always accounted for in financial reports as fully diluted earnings per share, which assumes that all warrants and convertibles will be exercised.

== Classification ==
Securities may be classified according to many categories or classification systems:

* Currency of denomination
* Ownership rights
* Terms to maturity
* Degree of liquidity
* Income payments
* Tax treatment
* Credit rating
* Industrial sector or &quot;industry&quot;. (&quot;Sector&quot; often refers to a higher level or broader category, such as &quot;Consumer Discretionary&quot;, whereas &quot;industry&quot; often refers to a lower level classification, such as &quot;Consumer Appliances&quot;. See Industry for a discussion of some classification systems.)
* Region or country (such as country of incorporation, country of principal sales/market of its products or services, or country in which the principal securities exchange where it trades is located)
* Market capitalization
* State (typically for municipal or &quot;tax-free&quot; bonds in the US)

== Type of holder ==
Investors in securities may be retail, i.e., members of the public investing personally, other than by way of business. 

In distinction, the greatest part of investment in terms of volume, is wholesale, i.e., by financial institutions acting on their own account, or on behalf of clients. 
Important institutional investors include investment banks, insurance companies, pension funds and other managed funds. 
The &quot;wholesaler&quot; is typically an underwriter or a broker-dealer who trades with other broker-dealers, rather than with the retail investor.

This distinction carries over to banking; compare Retail banking and Wholesale banking.

== Investment ==
The traditional economic function of the purchase of securities is investment, with the view to receiving income or achieving capital gain. Debt securities generally offer a higher rate of interest than bank deposits, and equities may offer the prospect of capital growth. Equity investment may also offer control of the business of the issuer. Debt holdings may also offer some measure of control to the investor if the company is a fledgling start-up or an old giant undergoing restructuring. In these cases, if interest payments are missed, the creditors may take control of the company and liquidate it to recover some of their investment.

== Collateral ==
The last decade has seen an enormous growth in the use of securities as collateral. Purchasing securities with borrowed money secured by other securities or cash itself is called &quot;buying on margin&quot;. Where A is owed a debt or other obligation by B, A may require B to deliver property rights in securities to A, either at inception (transfer of title) or only in default (non-transfer-of-title institutional). For institutional loans, property rights are not transferred but nevertheless enable A to satisfy its claims in case B fails to make good on its obligations to A or otherwise becomes insolvent. Collateral arrangements are divided into two broad categories, namely security interests and outright collateral transfers. Commonly, commercial banks, investment banks, government agencies and other institutional investors such as mutual funds are significant collateral takers as well as providers. In addition, private parties may utilize stocks or other securities as collateral for portfolio loans in securities lending scenarios.

On the consumer level, loans against securities have grown into three distinct groups over the last decade:
#Standard Institutional Loans, generally offering low loan-to-value with very strict call and coverage regimens, akin to standard margin loans;
#Transfer-of-Title (ToT) Loans, typically provided by private parties where borrower ownership is completely extinguished save for the rights provided in the loan contract; and
#Non-Transfer-of-Title Credit Line facilities where shares are not sold and they serve as assets in a standard lien-type line of cash credit.

Of the three, transfer-of-title loans have fallen into the very high-risk category as the number of providers has dwindled as regulators have launched an industry-wide crackdown on transfer-of-title structures where the private lender may sell or sell short the securities to fund the loan. Institutionally managed consumer securities-based loans on the other hand, draw loan funds from the financial resources of the lending institution, not from the sale of the securities.

Collateral and sources of collateral are changing, in 2012 gold became a more acceptable form of collateral. By 2015, recently Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) previously seen by many as unpromising had started to become more readily available and acceptable.

== Markets ==
=== Primary and secondary market ===
Public securities markets are either primary or secondary markets. In the primary market, the money for the securities is received by the issuer of the securities from investors, typically in an initial public offering (IPO). In the secondary market, the securities are simply assets held by one investor selling them to another investor, with the money going from one investor to the other.

An initial public offering is when a company issues public stock newly to investors, called an &quot;IPO&quot; for short. A company can later issue more new shares, or issue shares that have been previously registered in a shelf registration. These later new issues are also sold in the primary market, but they are not considered to be an IPO, and are often called a &quot;secondary offering&quot;. Issuers usually retain investment banks to assist them in administering the IPO, obtaining regulatory approval of the offering filing, and selling the new issue. When the investment bank buys the entire new issue from the issuer at a discount to resell it at a markup, it is called a firm commitment underwriting. However, if the investment bank considers the risk too great for an underwriting, it may only assent to a best effort agreement, where the investment bank will simply do its best to sell the new issue.

For the primary market to thrive, there must be a secondary market, or aftermarket that provides liquidity for the investment security—where holders of securities can sell them to other investors for cash. Otherwise, few people would purchase primary issues, and, thus, companies and governments would be restricted in raising equity capital (money) for their operations. Organized exchanges constitute the main secondary markets. Many smaller issues and most debt securities trade in the decentralized, dealer-based over-the-counter markets.

In Europe, the principal trade organization for securities dealers is the International Capital Market Association. In the U.S., the principal trade organization for securities dealers is the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which is the result of the merger of the Securities Industry Association and the Bond Market Association. The Financial Information Services Division of the Software and Information Industry Association (FISD/SIIA) represents a round-table of market data industry firms, referring to them as Consumers, Exchanges, and Vendors. In India the equivalent organisation is the securities exchange board of India (SEBI).

=== Public offer and private placement ===
In the primary markets, securities may be offered to the public in a public offering. Alternatively, they may be offered privately to a limited number of qualified persons in a private placement. Sometimes a combination of the two is used. The distinction between the two is important to securities regulation and company law. Privately placed securities are not publicly tradable and may only be bought and sold by sophisticated qualified investors. As a result, the secondary market is not nearly as liquid as it is for public (registered) securities.

Another category, sovereign bonds, is generally sold by auction to a specialized class of dealers.

=== Listing and over-the-counter dealing ===
Securities are often listed in a stock exchange, an organized and officially recognized market on which securities can be bought and sold. Issuers may seek listings for their securities to attract investors, by ensuring there is a liquid and regulated market that investors can buy and sell securities in.

Growth in informal electronic trading systems has challenged the traditional business of stock exchanges. Large volumes of securities are also bought and sold &quot;over the counter&quot; (OTC). OTC dealing involves buyers and sellers dealing with each other by telephone or electronically on the basis of prices that are displayed electronically, usually by financial data vendors such as SuperDerivatives, Reuters, Investing.com and Bloomberg.

There are also eurosecurities, which are securities that are issued outside their domestic market into more than one jurisdiction. They are generally listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or admitted to listing in London. The reasons for listing eurobonds include regulatory and tax considerations, as well as the investment restrictions.

=== Securities services ===
Securities Services refers to the products and services that are offered to institutional clients that issue, trade, and hold securities. The bank engaged in securities services are usually called a custodian bank. Market players include BNY Mellon, J.P. Morgan, HSBC, Citi, BNP Paribas, Société Générale etc.

=== Market ===
London is the centre of the eurosecurities markets. There was a huge rise in the eurosecurities market in London in the early 1980s. Settlement of trades in eurosecurities is currently effected through two international central securities depositories, namely Euroclear Bank (in Belgium) and Clearstream Banking SA (formerly Cedel, in Luxembourg).

The main market for Eurobonds is the EuroMTS, owned by Borsa Italiana and Euronext. There are ramp up market in Emergent countries, but it is growing slowly.

== Physical nature ==
=== Certificated securities ===
Securities that are represented in paper (physical) form are called certificated securities. They may be &quot;bearer&quot; or &quot;registered&quot;.

=== DRS securities ===
Securities may also be held in the Direct Registration System (DRS), which is a method of recording shares of stock in book-entry form. Book-entry means the company&#x27;s transfer agent maintains the shares on the owner&#x27;s behalf without the need for physical share certificates. Shares held in un-certificated book-entry form have the same rights and privileges as shares held in certificated form.

==== Bearer securities ====
Bearer securities are completely negotiable and entitle the holder to the rights under the security (e.g., to payment if it is a debt security, and voting if it is an equity security). They are transferred by delivering the instrument from person to person. In some cases, transfer is by endorsement, or signing the back of the instrument, and delivery.

Regulatory and fiscal authorities sometimes regard bearer securities negatively, as they may be used to facilitate the evasion of regulatory restrictions and tax. In the United Kingdom, for example, the issue of bearer securities was heavily restricted firstly by the &quot;Exchange Control Act&quot; 1947 until 1953. Bearer securities are very rare in the United States because of the negative tax implications they may have to the issuer and holder.

In Luxembourg, the law of 28 July 2014 concerning the compulsory deposit and immobilization of shares and units in bearer form adopts the compulsory deposit and immobilization of bearer shares and units with a depositary allowing identification of the holders thereof.

==== Registered securities ====
In the case of registered securities, certificates bearing the name of the holder are issued, but these merely represent the securities. A person does not automatically acquire legal ownership by having possession of the certificate. Instead, the issuer (or its appointed agent) maintains a register in which details of the holder of the securities are entered and updated as appropriate. A transfer of registered securities is effected by amending the register.

=== Non-certificated securities and global certificates ===
Modern practice has developed to eliminate both the need for certificates and maintenance of a complete security register by the issuer. There are two general ways this has been accomplished.

==== Non-certificated securities ====
In some jurisdictions, such as France, it is possible for issuers of that jurisdiction to maintain a legal record of their securities electronically.

In the United States, the current &quot;official&quot; version of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code permits non-certificated securities. However, the &quot;official&quot; UCC is a mere draft that must be enacted individually by each U.S. state. Though all 50 states (as well as the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands) have enacted some form of Article 8, many of them still appear to use older versions of Article 8, including some that did not permit non-certificated securities.

==== Global certificates, book entry interests, depositories ====
To facilitate the electronic transfer of interests in securities without dealing with inconsistent versions of Article 8, a system has developed whereby issuers deposit a single global certificate representing all the outstanding securities of a class or series with a universal depository. This depository is called The Depository Trust Company, or DTC. DTC&#x27;s parent, Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), is a non-profit cooperative owned by approximately thirty of the largest Wall Street players that typically act as brokers or dealers in securities. These thirty banks are called the DTC participants. DTC, through a legal nominee, owns each of the global securities on behalf of all the DTC participants.

All securities traded through DTC are in fact held, in electronic form, on the books of various intermediaries between the ultimate owner, e.g., a retail investor, and the DTC participants. For example, Mr. Smith may hold 100 shares of Coca-Cola, Inc. in his brokerage account at local broker Jones &amp; Co. brokers. In turn, Jones &amp; Co. may hold 1000 shares of Coca-Cola on behalf of Mr. Smith and nine other customers. These 1000 shares are held by Jones &amp; Co. in an account with Goldman Sachs, a DTC participant, or in an account at another DTC participant. Goldman Sachs in turn may hold millions of Coca-Cola shares on its books on behalf of hundreds of brokers similar to Jones &amp; Co. Each day, the DTC participants settle their accounts with the other DTC participants and adjust the number of shares held on their books for the benefit of customers like Jones &amp; Co. Ownership of securities in this fashion is called beneficial ownership. Each intermediary holds on behalf of someone beneath him in the chain. The ultimate owner is called the beneficial owner. This is also referred to as owning in &quot;Street name&quot;.

Among brokerages and mutual fund companies, a large amount of mutual fund share transactions take place among intermediaries as opposed to shares being sold and redeemed directly with the transfer agent of the fund. Most of these intermediaries such as brokerage firms clear the shares electronically through the National Securities Clearing Corp. or &quot;NSCC&quot;, a subsidiary of DTCC.

==== Other depositories ====
Besides DTC in the US, central securities depositories (CSDs) exist on a national basis in most jurisdictions. In addition, two major international CSDs exist, both based in Europe, namely Euroclear Bank and Clearstream Banking SA.

=== Divided and undivided security ===
The terms &quot;divided&quot; and &quot;undivided&quot; relate to the proprietary nature of a security.

Each divided security constitutes a separate asset, which is legally distinct from each other security in the same issue. Pre-electronic bearer securities were divided. Each instrument constitutes the separate covenant of the issuer and is a separate debt.

With undivided securities, the entire issue makes up one single asset, with each of the securities being a fractional part of this undivided whole. Shares in the secondary markets are always undivided. The issuer owes only one set of obligations to shareholders under its memorandum, articles of association and company law. A share represents an undivided fractional part of the issuing company. Registered debt securities also have this undivided nature.

=== Fungible and non-fungible securities ===

In a fungible security, all holdings of the security are treated identically and are interchangeable.

Sometimes securities are not fungible with other securities, for example different series of bonds issued by the same company at different times with different conditions attaching to them.

== Regulation ==
In the US, the public offer and sale of securities must be either registered pursuant to a registration statement that is filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or are offered and sold pursuant to an exemption therefrom. Dealing in securities is regulated by both federal authorities (SEC) and state securities departments. In addition, the brokerage industry is supposedly self policed by self-regulatory organizations (SROs), such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers (or NASD), or the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).

With respect to investment schemes that do not fall within the traditional categories of securities listed in the definition of a security (Sec. 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sec. 3(a)(10) of the 34 act) the US Courts have developed a broad definition for securities that must then be registered with the SEC. When determining if there is an &quot;investment contract&quot; that must be registered the courts look for an investment of money, a common enterprise and expectation of profits to come primarily from the efforts of others. See &quot;SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.&quot;

<doc id="42168" wikidata="Q389772" url="?curid=42168" title="Data communication">
<text>Data communication, including data transmission and data reception, is the transfer of data, transmitted and received over a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication channel. Examples of such channels are copper wires, optical fibers, wireless communication using radio spectrum, storage media and computer buses. The data are represented as an electromagnetic signal, such as an electrical voltage, radiowave, microwave, or infrared signal.

&quot;Analog transmission&quot; is a method of conveying voice, data, image, signal or video information using a continuous signal that varies in amplitude, phase, or some other property in proportion to that of a variable. The messages are either represented by a sequence of pulses by means of a line code (&quot;baseband transmission&quot;), or by a limited set of continuously varying waveforms (&quot;passband transmission&quot;), using a digital modulation method. The passband modulation and corresponding demodulation is carried out by modem equipment.

Digital communications, including digital transmission and digital reception, is the transfer of 
either a digitized analog signal or a born-digital bitstream. According to the most common definition, both baseband and passband bit-stream components are considered part of a digital signal; an alternative definition considers only the baseband signal as digital, and passband transmission of digital data as a form of digital-to-analog conversion.

==Distinction between related subjects==
Courses and textbooks in the field of &quot;data transmission&quot; as well as &quot;digital transmission&quot; and &quot;digital communications&quot; have similar content.

Digital transmission or data transmission traditionally belongs to telecommunications and electrical engineering. Basic principles of data transmission may also be covered within the computer science or computer engineering topic of data communications, which also includes computer networking applications and communication protocols, for example routing, switching and inter-process communication. Although the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) involves transmission, TCP and other transport layer protocols are covered in computer networking but &quot;not&quot; discussed in a textbook or course about data transmission.

In most textbooks, the term analog transmission only refers to the transmission of an analog message signal (without digitization) by means of an analog signal, either as a non-modulated baseband signal or as a passband signal using an analog modulation method such as AM or FM. It may also include analog-over-analog pulse modulated baseband signals such as pulse-width modulation. In a few books within the computer networking tradition, &quot;analog transmission&quot; also refers to passband transmission of bit-streams using digital modulation methods such as FSK, PSK and ASK.

The theoretical aspects of data transmission are covered by information theory and coding theory.

==Protocol layers and sub-topics==

Courses and textbooks in the field of data transmission typically deal with the following OSI model protocol layers and topics:
* Layer 1, the physical layer:
** Channel coding including
*** Digital modulation schemes
*** Line coding schemes
*** Forward error correction (FEC) codes
** Bit synchronization
** Multiplexing
** Equalization
** Channel models
* Layer 2, the data link layer:
** Channel access schemes, media access control (MAC)
** Packet mode communication and Frame synchronization
** Error detection and automatic repeat request (ARQ)
** Flow control
* Layer 6, the presentation layer:
** Source coding (digitization and data compression), and information theory.
** Cryptography (may occur at any layer)
It is also common to deal with the cross-layer design of those three layers.

==Applications and history==
Data (mainly but not exclusively informational) has been sent via non-electronic (e.g. optical, acoustic, mechanical) means since the advent of communication. Analog signal data has been sent electronically since the advent of the telephone. However, the first data electromagnetic transmission applications in modern time were electrical telegraphy (1809) and teletypewriters (1906), which are both digital signals. The fundamental theoretical work in data transmission and information theory by Harry Nyquist, Ralph Hartley, Claude Shannon and others during the early 20th century, was done with these applications in mind.

In the early 1960s, Paul Baran invented &quot;distributed adaptive message block switching&quot; for digital communication of voice messages using switches that were low-cost electronics. Donald Davies invented and implemented modern data communication during 1965-7, including packet switching, high-speed routers, communication protocols, hierarchical computer networks and the essence of the end-to-end principle. Baran&#x27;s work did not include routers with software switches and communication protocols, nor the idea that users, rather than the network itself, would provide the reliability. Both were seminal contributions that influenced the development of computer networks.

Data transmission is utilized in computers in computer buses and for communication with peripheral equipment via parallel ports and serial ports such as RS-232 (1969), FireWire (1995) and USB (1996). The principles of data transmission are also utilized in storage media for error detection and correction since 1951. The first practical method to overcome the problem of receiving data accurately by the receiver using digital code was the Barker code invented by Ronald Hugh Barker in 1952 and published in 1953. Data transmission is utilized in computer networking equipment such as modems (1940), local area network (LAN) adapters (1964), repeaters, repeater hubs, microwave links, wireless network access points (1997), etc.

In telephone networks, digital communication is utilized for transferring many phone calls over the same copper cable or fiber cable by means of pulse-code modulation (PCM) in combination with time-division multiplexing (TDM) (1962). Telephone exchanges have become digital and software controlled, facilitating many value-added services. For example, the first AXE telephone exchange was presented in 1976. Digital communication to the end user using Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) services became available in the late 1980s. Since the end of the 1990s, broadband access techniques such as ADSL, Cable modems, fiber-to-the-building (FTTB) and fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) have become widespread to small offices and homes. The current tendency is to replace traditional telecommunication services with packet mode communication such as IP telephony and IPTV.

Transmitting analog signals digitally allows for greater signal processing capability. The ability to process a communications signal means that errors caused by random processes can be detected and corrected. Digital signals can also be sampled instead of continuously monitored. The multiplexing of multiple digital signals is much simpler compared to the multiplexing of analog signals. Because of all these advantages, because of the vast demand to transmit computer data and the ability of digital communications to do so and because recent advances in wideband communication channels and solid-state electronics have allowed engineers to realize these advantages fully, digital communications have grown quickly.

The digital revolution has also resulted in many digital telecommunication applications where the principles of data transmission are applied. Examples include second-generation (1991) and later cellular telephony, video conferencing, digital TV (1998), digital radio (1999), and telemetry.

Data transmission, digital transmission or digital communications is the transfer of data over a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication channel. Examples of such channels include copper wires, optical fibers, wireless communication channels, storage media and computer buses. The data are represented as an electromagnetic signal, such as an electrical voltage, radio wave, microwave, or infrared light.

While analog transmission is the transfer of a continuously varying analog signal over an analog channel, digital communication is the transfer of discrete messages over a digital or an analog channel. The messages are either represented by a sequence of pulses by means of a line code (baseband transmission), or by a limited set of continuously varying wave forms (passband transmission), using a digital modulation method. The passband modulation and corresponding demodulation (also known as detection) is carried out by modem equipment. According to the most common definition of a digital signal, both baseband and passband signals representing bit-streams are considered as digital transmission, while an alternative definition only considers the baseband signal as digital, and passband transmission of digital data as a form of digital-to-analog conversion.

Data transmitted may be digital messages originating from a data source, for example a computer or a keyboard. It may also be an analog signal such as a phone call or a video signal, digitized into a bit-stream for example using pulse-code modulation (PCM) or more advanced source coding (analog-to-digital conversion and data compression) schemes. This source coding and decoding is carried out by codec equipment.

==Serial and parallel transmission==
In telecommunications, serial transmission is the sequential transmission of signal elements of a group representing a character or other entity of data. Digital serial transmissions are bits sent over a single wire, frequency or optical path sequentially. Because it requires less signal processing and less chances for error than parallel transmission, the transfer rate of each individual path may be faster. This can be used over longer distances and a check digit or parity bit can be sent along with the data easily.

Parallel transmission is the simultaneous transmission of related signal elements over two or more separate paths. Multiple electrical wires are used that can transmit multiple bits simultaneously, which allows for higher data transfer rates than can be achieved with serial transmission. This method is typically used internally within the computer, for example, the internal buses, and sometimes externally for such things as printers. Timing skew can be a significant issue in these systems because the wires in parallel data transmission unavoidably have slightly different properties so some bits may arrive before others, which may corrupt the message. This issue tends to worsen with distance making parallel data transmission less reliable for long distances.

==Communication channels==
Some communications channel types include:
* Data transmission circuit
* Full-duplex
* Half-duplex
* Simplex
* Multi-drop:
** Bus network
** Mesh network
** Ring network
** Star network
** Wireless network
* Point-to-point

==Asynchronous and synchronous data transmission==
Asynchronous serial communication uses start and stop bits to signify the beginning and end of transmission. This method of transmission is used when data are sent intermittently as opposed to in a solid stream.

Synchronous transmission synchronizes transmission speeds at both the receiving and sending end of the transmission using clock signals. The clock may be a separate signal or embedded in the data. A continual stream of data is then sent between the two nodes. Due to there being no start and stop bits, the data transfer rate may be more efficient.

<text>In algebra, the dual numbers are a hypercomplex number system first introduced in the 19th century. They are expressions of the form , where and are real numbers, and is a symbol taken to satisfy formula_1 with formula_2.

Dual numbers can be added component-wise, and multiplied by the formula
: formula_3
which follows from the property and the fact that multiplication is a bilinear operation.

The dual numbers form a commutative algebra of dimension two over the reals, and also an Artinian local ring. They are one of the simplest examples of a ring that has nonzero nilpotent elements.

==History==
Dual numbers were introduced in 1873 by William Clifford, and were used at the beginning of the twentieth century by the German mathematician Eduard Study, who used them to represent the dual angle which measures the relative position of two skew lines in space. Study defined a dual angle as , where is the angle between the directions of two lines in three-dimensional space and is a distance between them. The -dimensional generalization, the Grassmann number, was introduced by Hermann Grassmann in the late 19th century.

==Modern definition==

In modern algebra, the algebra of dual numbers is often defined as the quotient of a polynomial ring over the real numbers formula_4 by the principal ideal generated by the square of the indeterminate, that is
:formula_5

It may also be defined as the exterior algebra of a one-dimensional vector space with formula_6 as its basis element.

==Division==
Division of dual numbers is defined when the real part of the denominator is non-zero. The division process is analogous to complex division in that the denominator is multiplied by its conjugate in order to cancel the non-real parts.

Therefore, to evaluate an expression of the form
:formula_7

we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
:formula_8

which is defined when is non-zero.

If, on the other hand, is zero while is not, then the equation
:formula_9
# has no solution if is nonzero
# is otherwise solved by any dual number of the form .
This means that the non-real part of the &quot;quotient&quot; is arbitrary and division is therefore not defined for purely nonreal dual numbers. Indeed, they are (trivially) zero divisors and clearly form an ideal of the associative algebra (and thus ring) of the dual numbers.

==Matrix representation==

The dual number formula_10 can be represented by the square matrix formula_11. In this representation the matrix formula_12 squares to the zero matrix, corresponding to the dual number formula_6.

Generally, if formula_6 is a nilpotent matrix, then &quot;B&quot; = {&quot;x&quot; I + &quot;y&quot; formula_6: &quot;x, y&quot; real} is a subalgebra isomorphic to the algebra of dual numbers. In the case of 2x2 real matrices M(2,R), formula_6 can be taken as any matrix of the form formula_17 with &quot;p&quot; = &quot;a&quot;2 + &quot;bc&quot; = 0.

The dual numbers are one of three isomorphism classes of real 2-algebras in M(2,R). When &quot;p&quot; &gt; 0 the subalgebra &quot;B&quot; is isomorphic to split-complex numbers, and when &quot;p&quot; &lt; 0, &quot;B&quot; is isomorphic to the complex plane.

==Differentiation==
One application of dual numbers is automatic differentiation. Any polynomial

:formula_18

with real coefficients can be extended to a function of a dual-number-valued argument,

:formula_19

where formula_20 is the derivative of formula_21

More generally, any (analytic) real function can be extended to the dual numbers via its Taylor series:

:formula_22

since all terms involving or greater powers are trivially by the definition of .

By computing compositions of these functions over the dual numbers and examining the coefficient of in the result we find we have automatically computed the derivative of the composition.

A similar method works for polynomials of variables, using the exterior algebra of an -dimensional vector space.

==Geometry==
The &quot;unit circle&quot; of dual numbers consists of those with since these satisfy where . However, note that
: formula_23
so the exponential map applied to the -axis covers only half the &quot;circle&quot;.

Let . If and , then is the polar decomposition of the dual number , and the slope is its angular part. The concept of a &quot;rotation&quot; in the dual number plane is equivalent to a vertical shear mapping since .

In absolute space and time the Galilean transformation
:formula_24

that is
:formula_25

relates the resting coordinates system to a moving frame of reference of velocity . With dual numbers representing events along one space dimension and time, the same transformation is effected with multiplication by .

===Cycles===
Given two dual numbers and , they determine the set of such that the difference in slopes (&quot;Galilean angle&quot;) between the lines from to and is constant. This set is a cycle in the dual number plane; since the equation setting the difference in slopes of the lines to a constant is a quadratic equation in the real part of , a cycle is a parabola. The &quot;cyclic rotation&quot; of the dual number plane occurs as a motion of its projective line. According to Isaak Yaglom, the cycle is invariant under the composition of the shear
:formula_26

with the translation
:formula_27

==Applications in mechanics==
Dual numbers find applications in mechanics, notably for kinematic synthesis. For example, the dual numbers make it possible to transform the input/output equations of a four-bar spherical linkage, which includes only rotoid joints, into a four-bar spatial mechanism (rotoid, rotoid, rotoid, cylindrical). The dualized angles are made of a primitive part, the angles, and a dual part, which has units of length. See screw theory for more.

== Algebraic geometry ==
In modern algebraic geometry, the dual numbers over a field formula_28 (by which we mean the ring formula_29) may be used to define the tangent vectors to the points of a formula_28-scheme. Since the field formula_28 can be chosen intrinsically, it is possible to speak simply of the tangent vectors to a scheme. This allows notions from differential geometry to be imported into algebraic geometry.

In detail: The ring of dual numbers may be thought of as the ring of functions on the &quot;first-order neighborhood of a point&quot; – namely, the formula_32-scheme formula_33. Then, given a formula_32-scheme formula_35, formula_32-points of the scheme are in 1-1 correspondence with maps formula_37, while tangent vectors are in 1-1 correspondence with maps formula_38.

The field formula_28 above can be chosen intrinsically to be a residue field. To wit: Given a point formula_40 on a scheme formula_41, consider the stalk formula_42. Observe that formula_42 is a local ring with a unique maximal ideal, which is denoted formula_44. Then simply let formula_45.
==Generalizations==
This construction can be carried out more generally: for a commutative ring one can define the dual numbers over as the quotient of the polynomial ring by the ideal : the image of then has square equal to zero and corresponds to the element from above.

=== Arbitrary module of elements of zero square ===
There is a more general construction of the dual numbers. Given a commutative ring formula_46 and a module formula_47, there is a ring formula_48 called the ring of dual numbers which has the following structures:

It is the formula_46-module formula_50 with the multiplication defined by formula_51 for formula_52 and formula_53

The algebra of dual numbers is the special case where formula_54 and formula_55
==Superspace==
Dual numbers find applications in physics, where they constitute one of the simplest non-trivial examples of a superspace. Equivalently, they are supernumbers with just one generator; supernumbers generalize the concept to distinct generators , each anti-commuting, possibly taking to infinity. Superspace generalizes supernumbers slightly, by allowing multiple commuting dimensions.

The motivation for introducing dual numbers into physics follows from the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions. The direction along is termed the &quot;fermionic&quot; direction, and the real component is termed the &quot;bosonic&quot; direction. The fermionic direction earns this name from the fact that fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle: under the exchange of coordinates, the quantum mechanical wave function changes sign, and thus vanishes if two coordinates are brought together; this physical idea is captured by the algebraic relation .

==Projective line==
The idea of a projective line over dual numbers was advanced by Grünwald and Corrado Segre.

Just as the Riemann sphere needs a north pole point at infinity to close up the complex projective line, so a line at infinity succeeds in closing up the plane of dual numbers to a cylinder.

Suppose is the ring of dual numbers and is the subset with . Then is the group of units of . Let . A relation is defined on B as follows: when there is a in such that and . This relation is in fact an equivalence relation. The points of the projective line over are equivalence classes in under this relation: . They are represented with projective coordinates .

Consider the embedding by . Then points , for , are in but are not the image of any point under the embedding. is mapped onto a cylinder by projection: Take a cylinder tangent to the double number plane on the line , . Now take the opposite line on the cylinder for the axis of a pencil of planes. The planes intersecting the dual number plane and cylinder provide a correspondence of points between these surfaces. The plane parallel to the dual number plane corresponds to points , in the projective line over dual numbers.

<doc id="42172" wikidata="Q49216" url="?curid=42172" title="Walter Mondale">
<text>Walter Frederick &quot;Fritz&quot; Mondale (January 5, 1928April 19, 2021) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 42nd vice president of the United States from 1977 to 1981 under President Jimmy Carter. He previously served as a U.S. senator from Minnesota from 1964 to 1976. He was the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee in the 1984 presidential election but lost to incumbent Ronald Reagan in an Electoral College and popular vote landslide.

Mondale was born in Ceylon, Minnesota, and graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1951 after attending Macalester College. He then served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War before earning a law degree in 1956. He married Joan Adams in 1955. Working as a lawyer in Minneapolis, Mondale was appointed Minnesota Attorney General in 1960 by Governor Orville Freeman and was elected to a full term as attorney general in 1962 with 60% of the vote. He was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Governor Karl Rolvaag upon the resignation of Senator Hubert Humphrey following Humphrey&#x27;s election as vice president in 1964. Mondale was elected to a full Senate term in 1966 and reelected in 1972, resigning in 1976 as he prepared to succeed to the vice presidency in 1977. While in the Senate, he supported consumer protection, fair housing, tax reform, and the desegregation of schools; he served on the Church Committee.

In 1976, Jimmy Carter, the Democratic presidential nominee, chose Mondale as his vice-presidential running mate. The Carter–Mondale ticket narrowly defeated the Republican ticket of incumbent president Gerald Ford and his running mate Bob Dole. The economy worsened during Carter and Mondale&#x27;s time in office, and they lost the 1980 presidential election to Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. In 1984, Mondale won the Democratic presidential nomination and campaigned for a nuclear freeze, the Equal Rights Amendment, an increase in taxes, and a reduction of U.S. public debt. His vice presidential nominee, U.S. Representative Geraldine Ferraro from New York, was the first female vice-presidential nominee of any major party in U.S. history. Mondale and Ferraro lost the election to the incumbents Reagan and Bush, with Reagan winning 49 states and Mondale carrying only his home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia.

After his defeat, Mondale joined the Minnesota-based law firm Dorsey &amp; Whitney and the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (1986–1993). President Bill Clinton appointed Mondale U.S. Ambassador to Japan in 1993; he retired from that post in 1996. In 2002, Mondale became the last-minute choice of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party to run for Senate after Democratic Senator Paul Wellstone died in a plane crash less than two weeks before the election. Mondale narrowly lost the race to Saint Paul mayor Norm Coleman. He then returned to working at Dorsey &amp; Whitney and remained active in the Democratic Party. Mondale later took up a part-time teaching position at the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs. He died in 2021 from natural causes.

== Early life ==
Walter Frederick Mondale was born on January 5, 1928, in Ceylon, Minnesota, to Theodore Sigvaard Mondale, a Methodist minister, and Claribel Hope (née Cowan), a part-time music teacher. Walter&#x27;s half-brother Lester Mondale became a Unitarian minister. Mondale also had two brothers, Clarence, known as Pete (1926–2014), and William, known as Mort. His paternal grandparents were Norwegian immigrants, with some distant German ancestry. Mondale&#x27;s paternal grandfather Frederik Mundal had emigrated from Norway with his family in 1856, eventually settling in southern Minnesota in 1864. The surname &quot;Mondale&quot; was Americanized from that of Mundal, a valley and town in the Fjærland region of Norway. His mother was born in Iowa, the daughter of an immigrant father, Robert Cowan, who was born in Seaforth, Ontario; she was of Scottish and English descent.

In his youth, Mondale&#x27;s family thought the names &quot;Walter&quot; and &quot;Frederick&quot; were too stilted for a boy, so they called him &quot;Fritz&quot;, a common German and Scandinavian diminutive form of Friedrich or Frederick. Due to the Great Depression, Mondale grew up in poverty. His family moved from Ceylon to Heron Lake in 1934, and to Elmore in 1937. Throughout his youth, Mondale was influenced heavily by his father&#x27;s religious beliefs, including support for the civil rights movement. In 1948, his father died of a stroke. Mondale attended public schools and then Macalester College for two years before transferring to the University of Minnesota, from which he graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1951.

As Mondale could not afford to attend law school, he enlisted in the United States Army in 1951, shortly after graduating. He served with the 3rd Armored Division Artillery at Fort Knox, Kentucky, during the Korean War, first as an armored reconnaissance vehicle crewman, and later as an education programs specialist and associate editor of the unit&#x27;s newsletter, &quot;Tanker&#x27;s Dust&quot;. He attained the rank of corporal and was discharged in 1953. Mondale enrolled at the University of Minnesota Law School, aided by the G.I. Bill, and graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Laws in 1956. In law school, he served on the &quot;Minnesota Law Review&quot; and as a law clerk for Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Thomas F. Gallagher. In 1955, Mondale married Joan Adams, whom he met on a blind date. He then practiced law in Minneapolis for four years before entering politics.

==Entry into politics==
Mondale became involved in national politics in the 1940s. At age 20, he was visible in Minnesota politics by helping organize Hubert Humphrey&#x27;s successful Senate campaign in 1948. Humphrey&#x27;s campaign assigned Mondale to cover the staunchly Republican 2nd district. Mondale, who had grown up in the region, was able to win the district for Humphrey by a comfortable margin. After working with Humphrey, Mondale went on to work on several campaigns for Orville Freeman. Mondale worked on Freeman&#x27;s unsuccessful 1952 campaign for the governorship as well as his successful campaign in 1954 and his 1958 reelection campaign. In 1960, Freeman appointed Mondale Minnesota Attorney General following the resignation of Miles Lord. At the time he was appointed, Mondale was 32 years old and had been practicing law for four years. He was elected to the post in his own right in 1962.

During his tenure as Minnesota Attorney General, the case &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot; (which ultimately established the right of defendants in state courts to have a lawyer) was being heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. When those opposed to the right to counsel organized a friend of the court brief representing several state attorneys general for that position, Mondale organized a countering friend of the court brief from many more state attorneys general, arguing that defendants must be allowed a lawyer. He also continued the investigation of former Minneapolis mayor Marvin L. Kline and the mismanagement of the Sister Kenny Foundation. At the 1964 Democratic National Convention, Mondale played a major role in the proposed but ultimately unsuccessful compromise by which the national Democratic Party offered the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party two at-large seats. Mondale also served as a member of the President&#x27;s Consumer Advisory Council from 1960 to 1964.

==U.S. Senate (1964–1976)==

On December 30, 1964, Minnesota Governor Karl Rolvaag appointed Mondale to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy created by Hubert Humphrey&#x27;s resignation; Humphrey had stepped down after being elected vice president of the United States. Mondale was elected to the Senate for the first time in 1966, defeating Republican candidate Robert A. Forsythe by a margin of 53.9% to 45.2%.

In 1972, Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern offered Mondale an opportunity to be his vice-presidential running mate; he declined. That year, Mondale was re-elected to the Senate with over 57% of the vote, even as Republican President Richard Nixon carried Minnesota. He served in the 88th, 89th, 90th, 91st, 92nd, 93rd, and 94th congresses.

===Policies===
Mondale worked hard to build up the center of the party on economic and social issues. Unlike his father, a fervent liberal, he was not a crusader for the New Deal. Instead, he realized that the Democratic base (especially ethnic blue-collar workers) was gradually moving to the right, and he worked to keep their support. Mondale showed little or no interest in foreign policy until about 1974, when he realized that some foreign policy knowledge was necessary if he had loftier aspirations than the Senate. He developed a centrist position, avoiding alignment with either the party&#x27;s hawks (such as Henry M. Jackson) or its doves (such as McGovern).

Mondale took a liberal position on civil rights, which proved acceptable in Minnesota, a state with &quot;a minuscule black population&quot;. Mondale was a chief sponsor of the federal Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing and created the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity as the primary enforcer of the law. During Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s presidency, Mondale supported the Vietnam War. After Nixon became president in 1969, Mondale began to oppose the war and participated in legislation to restrict Nixon&#x27;s ability to prolong it. Mondale supported abortion rights.

===Committees===
Mondale rotated on and off numerous committees, including the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee; the Finance Committee; the Labor and Public Welfare Committee; the Budget Committee; and the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. He also served as chairman of the Select Committee on Equal Education Opportunity and the Intelligence Committee&#x27;s Domestic Task Force. He additionally served as chairman of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee&#x27;s subcommittee on Children and Youth and the Senate subcommittee on social security financing.

In 1975, Mondale served on the Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, chaired by Idaho Senator Frank Church, that investigated alleged abuses by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Documents declassified in 2017 show that the National Security Agency had created a file on Mondale as part of its monitoring of prominent U.S. citizens whose names appeared in Signals intelligence.

=== Apollo 1 accident (1967) ===
In 1967, Mondale served on the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee, then chaired by Clinton P. Anderson, when astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee were killed in a fire on January 27 while testing the Apollo 204 (later renumbered Apollo 1) spacecraft. NASA Administrator James E. Webb secured President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s approval for NASA to internally investigate the cause of the accident according to its established procedures, subject to Congressional oversight. NASA&#x27;s procedure called for Deputy Administrator (and de facto general manager) Robert C. Seamans to appoint and oversee an investigative panel.

In February, a reporter leaked to Mondale the existence of an internal NASA report issued in 1965 by Apollo program director Samuel C. Phillips, detailing management, cost, delivery, and quality problems of the Apollo prime contractor North American Aviation. In the February 27 hearing, Mondale asked Webb if he knew of such a report. Webb had not yet seen the December 1965 written report, so he responded in the negative. Seamans had passed along to Webb neither the written report nor the briefing presentation made to him in January 1966 by Phillips and Phillips&#x27;s boss, Manned Space Flight Administrator George Mueller. Both Seamans and Mueller had also been called to testify at this session. Mueller denied the report&#x27;s existence, though he must have been aware of it, as he had appended his own strongly worded letter to the copy sent to North American Aviation president Lee Atwood.

Seamans was afraid Mondale might be in possession of a copy (he was not), so he admitted that NASA often reviewed its contractors&#x27; performance, with both positive and negative results, but claimed that was nothing extraordinary. Under repeated questioning from Mondale, Webb promised that he would investigate whether the &quot;Phillips Report&quot; existed, and if so, whether a controlled release could be made to Congress. Immediately after the hearing, Webb saw the Phillips report for the first time. The controversy spread to both houses of Congress and grew (through the efforts of Mondale&#x27;s fellow committee member, Republican Margaret Chase Smith to include the second-guessing of NASA&#x27;s original selection in 1961 of North American as the prime Apollo spacecraft contractor, which Webb became forced to defend). The House NASA oversight committee, which was conducting its own hearings and had picked up on the controversy, was ultimately given a copy of the Phillips report.

While the committee, as a whole, believed that NASA should have informed Congress of the Phillips review results in 1966, its final report issued on January 30, 1968, concluded (as had NASA&#x27;s own accident investigation completed on April 5, 1967) that &quot;the findings of the [Phillips] task force had no effect on the accident, did not lead to the accident, and were not related to the accident&quot;. Yet Mondale wrote a minority opinion accusing NASA of &quot;evasiveness... lack of candor, ... patronizing attitude exhibited toward Congress, ... refusal to respond fully and forthrightly to legitimate congressional inquiries, and ... solicitous concern for corporate sensitivities at a time of national tragedy&quot;. Mondale explained his actions in a 2001 interview: &quot;I think that by forcing a public confrontation about these heretofore secret and deep concerns about the safety and the management of the program, it forced NASA to restructure and reorganize the program in a way that was much safer.&quot;

==Vice presidency (1977–1981)==

When Jimmy Carter won the Democratic nomination for president in 1976, he chose Mondale as his running mate. Mondale campaigned for the ticket in various states. While campaigning in Toledo, Ohio he said that the country needed a strong president to stop inflation and added that President Gerald Ford did not have the guts to stand up to big businesses. The ticket was narrowly elected on November 2, 1976, and Mondale was inaugurated as Vice President of the United States on January 20, 1977. He also became the first vice president to live at Number One Observatory Circle.

Under Carter, Mondale traveled extensively throughout the nation and the world advocating the administration&#x27;s foreign policy. His travels also included a visit to the , which was on station at the time in the Indian Ocean during the Iran hostage crisis. Mondale was the first vice president to have an office in the White House and established the concept of an &quot;activist Vice President&quot;. He had weekly lunches with the president and expanded the vice president&#x27;s role from figurehead to presidential advisor, full-time participant, and troubleshooter for the administration. Subsequent vice presidents have followed this model. In 1979, Twin Cities Public Television produced a documentary about his trip to Norway, titled &quot;Walter Mondale: There&#x27;s a Fjord in Your Past&quot;, a play on the well-known advertising slogan &quot;There&#x27;s a Ford in Your Future&quot;.

Mondale cast one tie-breaking vote in the U.S. Senate on November 4, 1977, allowing the Social Security financing bill to be passed.

===1980 election===

Carter and Mondale were renominated at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, but soundly lost to the Republican ticket of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. That year, Mondale opened the XIII Olympic Winter Games in Lake Placid, New York.

Carter and Mondale were the longest-living post-presidential team in American history. On May 23, 2006, they had been out of office for 9,254 days (25 years, 4 months and 3 days), surpassing the former record established by President John Adams and Vice President Thomas Jefferson, both of whom died on July 4, 1826. On September 8, 2012, Carter surpassed Herbert Hoover as the president with the longest retirement from office. On April 23, 2014, Mondale surpassed Richard Nixon as the vice president with the longest retirement from office at 12,146 days (33 years, 3 months and 3 days). At the time of his death, Mondale was the oldest living U.S. vice president and Carter was the oldest living U.S. president.

==Post-vice presidency (1981–2021)==
===1984 presidential campaign===

After losing the 1980 election, Mondale returned briefly to the practice of law at Winston and Strawn, a large Chicago-based law firm, but he intended to return to politics before long.

Mondale ran for the Democratic Party presidential nomination in the Democratic presidential primaries preceding the 1984 election, and was soon the front-runner. His opposition included Reverend Jesse Jackson and Senator Gary Hart from Colorado. Hart won the New Hampshire primary in March, but Mondale had much of the party leadership behind him. To great effect, Mondale used the Wendy&#x27;s slogan &quot;Where&#x27;s the beef?&quot; to describe Hart&#x27;s policies as lacking depth. Jackson, widely regarded as the first serious African-American candidate for president, held on longer, but Mondale gained the nomination with the majority of delegates.
At the Democratic National Convention, Mondale chose U.S. Representative Geraldine Ferraro from New York as his running mate, making her the first woman nominated for that position by a major party. Aides later said that Mondale was determined to make a historic choice with his vice presidential candidate, having considered San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein (female and Jewish); Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, an African American; and San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros, a Mexican American, as finalists. Others preferred Senator Lloyd Bentsen because he would appeal to the Deep South, or even nomination rival Gary Hart. Ferraro, as a Catholic, was criticized by some Catholic Church leaders for being pro-choice. Much more controversy erupted over her changing positions about the release of her husband&#x27;s tax returns, and her own ethics record in the House. Ferraro was on the defensive throughout much of the campaign, largely negating her breakthrough as the first woman on a major national ticket. She was also the first Italian American to reach that level in American politics.

When Mondale made his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention, he said: &quot;By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two‑thirds. Let&#x27;s tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won&#x27;t tell you. I just did.&quot; While this was meant to show that Mondale would be honest with voters, it was instead largely interpreted as a campaign pledge to raise taxes to spend on domestic programs, which was unappealing to many voters.
Mondale ran a liberal campaign, supporting a nuclear freeze and the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). He spoke against Reagan&#x27;s economic policies and in support of reducing federal budget deficits. However, the incumbent was popular, and Mondale&#x27;s campaign was widely considered ineffective. Mondale was also perceived as supporting the poor at the expense of the middle class. In the first televised debate he performed unexpectedly well, which led many to question Reagan&#x27;s age and capacity to endure the grueling demands of the presidency (Reagan was the oldest person to serve as president—73 at the time—while Mondale was 56). In the next debate on October 21, 1984, Reagan deflected the issue by quipping, &quot;I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent&#x27;s youth and inexperience.&quot;

Mondale was defeated in a landslide, receiving 37,577,352 votes (40.6% of the popular vote), and winning only the District of Columbia and his home state of Minnesota (even there his margin of victory was fewer than 3,800 votes), securing only 13 electoral votes to Reagan&#x27;s 525. The result was the worst electoral college defeat for any Democratic Party candidate in history, and the worst for any major-party candidate since Alf Landon&#x27;s loss to Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936.

===Private citizen and ambassador===

Mondale returned to private law practice with Dorsey &amp; Whitney in Minneapolis in 1987. From 1986 to 1993, he chaired the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs. During Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidency, he was United States Ambassador to Japan from 1993 to 1996, chaired a bipartisan group to study campaign finance reform, and was Clinton&#x27;s special envoy to Indonesia in 1998.

Until his appointment as Ambassador to Japan, Mondale was a Distinguished University Fellow in Law and Public Affairs at the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota. In 1990, he established the Mondale Policy Forum at the Humphrey Institute. The forum has brought together leading scholars and policymakers for annual conferences on domestic and international issues.

Mondale spoke before the U.S. Senate on September 4, 2002, delivering a lecture on his service, with commentary on the transformation of the office of the vice president during the Carter administration, the Senate cloture rule for ending debate, and his view of the future of the Senate. The lecture was a part of a continuing Senate &quot;Leaders Lecture Series&quot; that ran from 1998 to 2002.

===2002 U.S. Senate election and beyond===

In 2002, Democratic Senator Paul Wellstone from Minnesota, who was running for reelection, died in a plane crash 11 days before the November 5 election. Mondale replaced Wellstone on the ballot at the urging of Wellstone&#x27;s relatives. The Senate seat was the one Mondale had held before resigning to become vice president in 1977.
During his debate with the Republican nominee, former St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman, Mondale emphasized his experience, while painting Coleman as right-wing partisan in-line with then-president Bush. Mondale unexpectedly lost the election, receiving 1,067,246 votes (47.34%) to Coleman&#x27;s 1,116,697 (49.53%). Upon conceding defeat, Mondale said, &quot;At the end of what will be my last campaign, I want to say to Minnesota, you always treated me well, you always listened to me.&quot; Mondale&#x27;s loss in this election made him the first major party candidate to lose an election in every state. 

In 2004, Mondale became co-chairman of the Constitution Project&#x27;s bipartisan Right to Counsel Committee. He endorsed Senator Hillary Clinton for president in 2008. On June 3, 2008, following the final primary contests, Mondale endorsed Senator Barack Obama, who had clinched the nomination the previous evening, and won the presidency.

Following the presidential election of 2004 and the midterm elections of 2006, Mondale is seen in the documentary &quot;Al Franken: God Spoke&quot; talking with Al Franken about the possibility of the latter running against Coleman for U.S. Senate in 2008. In the film, Mondale encourages Franken to run, but cautions him, saying that Coleman&#x27;s allies and the Republican Party would look for anything they could use against him. Franken ultimately ran and won the 2008 Senate election by 312 votes, with Coleman contesting the election results until June 30, 2009. Mondale and Senator Amy Klobuchar stood with Franken in the United States Senate chamber when Franken was sworn in on July 7, 2009.

Mondale then stood again with Senator Klobuchar when Tina Smith was sworn in on January 3, 2018. He endorsed Klobuchar for president in February 2019.

==Family and personal life==

Mondale&#x27;s wife, Joan Mondale, was a national advocate for the arts and was the Honorary Chairman of the Federal Council on the Arts and Humanities during the Carter Administration. On February 3, 2014, she died at a hospice in Minneapolis surrounded by family members.

The Mondales&#x27; eldest son, Ted, is an entrepreneur and the CEO of Nazca Solutions, a technology fulfillment venture. He is also a former Minnesota state senator. In 1998, Ted Mondale unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for Minnesota governor, running as a fiscal moderate who had distanced himself from labor. The Mondales&#x27; daughter, Eleanor, was a television personality. She also had radio talk shows in Chicago and a long-running program on WCCO (AM) in Minneapolis. She died of brain cancer at her home in Minnesota on September 17, 2011, at the age of 51. Their younger son, William Hall Mondale, is a former assistant Attorney General of Minnesota.

Mondale had a residence near Lake of the Isles in Minneapolis. He was a Presbyterian. He enjoyed fishing, reading Shakespeare and historical accounts, barbecuing, skiing, watching &quot;Monty Python&quot;, and playing tennis. Mondale was the recipient of numerous distinctions. He was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa as an honoris causa initiate at the University of South Carolina in 1981. Mondale also maintained strong ties to the University of Minnesota Law School. In 2002 the school renamed its building Walter F. Mondale Hall. Mondale contributed cameo appearances to the law school&#x27;s annual T.O.R.T. (&quot;Theater of the Relatively Talentless&quot;) productions and allowed his name to be used as the nickname of the school&#x27;s hockey team: the &quot;Fighting Mondales&quot;.

Mondale had deep connections to his ancestral Norway. Upon entering the Senate in 1964, he took over the seat of vice president Hubert Humphrey, another Norwegian-American. In later years, Mondale served on the executive committee of the Peace Prize Forum, an annual conference co-sponsored by the Norwegian Nobel Institute. On December 5, 2007, Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr Støre announced that Mondale would be named Honorary Consul-General of Norway, representing the Norwegian state in Minnesota. In 2015, Mondale was awarded the Public Leadership in Neurology Award from the American Academy of Neurology for raising awareness for brain health, having lost both his wife and daughter to brain diseases.

== Death ==

Mondale died of natural causes in his sleep at his home in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on April 19, 2021, at the age of 93. At the time of his death, Mondale was the oldest living former U.S. vice president. On the day before his death, he had several phone conversations with Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Minnesota governor Tim Walz. Mondale also emailed a final message to his staff, as he and his family had come to the conclusion that &quot;his death was imminent&quot;.

Carter said in a statement: &quot;Today I mourn the passing of my dear friend Walter Mondale, who I consider the best vice president in our country&#x27;s history ... Rosalynn and I join all Americans in giving thanks for his exemplary life, and we extend our deepest condolences to his family.&quot; Carter had last seen Mondale in person at the Carter Center in June 2019.

President Biden paid tribute to Mondale in a public statement, calling him a &quot;dear friend and mentor&quot; who had &quot;defined the vice presidency as a full partnership, and helped provide a model for my service&quot;. On April 20, 2021, Biden ordered all flags at government properties, office buildings and public grounds to be flown at half-staff until that Tuesday evening in honor of Mondale.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, funeral services for Mondale were delayed. Two public services were initially planned for September 2021, one in his home state of Minnesota and the other in Washington D.C.; both were later postponed. A memorial service was later held on May 1, 2022, at Northrop Auditorium on the Minneapolis campus of the University of Minnesota. Attendees included family, friends, state and national leaders, including President Joe Biden.

<text>Aston Villa Football Club (commonly referred to as simply Villa) is a professional football club based in Aston, Birmingham, England. The club, founded in 1874, compete in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. The team have played at their home ground, Villa Park, since 1897. Aston Villa are one of the oldest and most successful clubs in England, having won the Football League First Division seven times, the FA Cup seven times, the League Cup five times, and the European Cup and European Super Cup once.

Aston Villa has been a leading English club since the 1880s, when they were pioneers of the modern passing game. This short, slick combination passing style was introduced by Scotsman George Ramsay, who was appointed as the world&#x27;s first professional football manager in 1886. The club was influential in the sport&#x27;s move to professionalism in 1885, and it was a Villa director, William McGregor, who founded the world&#x27;s first Football League in 1888.

George Ramsay&#x27;s trophy haul of six League Championships and six FA Cups established Aston Villa as the most successful club in England, a position it held from the 1890s until the 1970s. Villa scored 128 goals in season 1930–31, which remains the all-time top-flight record, however the club began its first decline in the mid-1930s; the 1940s and 1950s were generally a period of mediocrity followed by a steep decline in the 1960s which culminated in a takeover of the club by Doug Ellis in 1968 and Villa&#x27;s first and only relegation to the third tier of English football in 1969–70. Villa returned to the elite from the mid-1970s under manager Ron Saunders, who led the club to a seventh top-flight league title in 1980–81. They became only the fourth English club to win the European Cup, in 1981–82, followed by the European Super Cup in 1982.

Aston Villa were a founding member of the Premier League in 1992, one of just three clubs to have been a founding member of both the Football League and the Premier League. The club regularly qualified for European football in the 1990s, but following a period in which the club struggled to compete with the high levels of spending of the leading clubs, Doug Ellis sold his stake in the club to American billionaire Randy Lerner, whose ownership of the club ended with Villa&#x27;s first and only relegation from the Premier League in season 2015–16. The club returned to the Premier League in 2019.

During their history Villa has spent 111 seasons in the top-flight, the second highest of any club, and provided 78 England internationals, also the second highest of any club. Aston Villa is currently ranked 5th in the all-time English top flight table, since its creation in 1888 and is the seventh most successful club in English football by competitive honours.

Villa have a fierce local rivalry with Birmingham City and the Second City derby between the teams has been played since 1879. There is also a local rivalry with West Bromwich Albion, with matches between the sides known as the West Midlands derby. The club&#x27;s traditional kit colours are claret shirts with sky blue sleeves, white shorts and sky blue socks. Their traditional club badge is of a rampant lion. The club is currently owned by V Sports, a company owned by the Egyptian billionaire Nassef Sawiris, the American billionaire Wes Edens, and American investment company Atairos.

== History ==

===Formation and rise to prominence (1874−1886)===
Aston Villa Football Club are believed to have formed on 21 November 1874, by members of the Villa Cross Wesleyan Chapel in Handsworth: which is now part of Birmingham. The four founders of Aston Villa were Jack Hughes, Frederick Matthews, Walter Price and William Scattergood, who were members of the chapel&#x27;s cricket team looking for a way to stay fit during the winter months. Due to the lack of local football teams Aston Villa&#x27;s first match was against the local Aston Brook St Mary&#x27;s Rugby team. As a condition of the match, the Villa side had to agree to play the first half under Rugby rules and the second half under Association rules. Villa won their first game 1–0.

The infant club&#x27;s fortunes changed forever when a young Scotsman called George Ramsay stumbled across the Villa players&#x27; practice match in Aston Park in 1876. He was asked to make up the numbers, and they were amazed by his skills; they had never seen such a display of close ball control before. When the game was over, the Villa players surrounded him and invited him to join the club and become their captain. Word spread about how fine a player Ramsay was, spectators began turning up to watch the little man nicknamed ‘Scotty’. He also took charge of training, Ramsay later described the newly formed club&#x27;s approach to the game as &#x27;a dash at the man and a big kick at the ball&#x27;. Ramsay was influenced by the Scottish club, Queen&#x27;s Park, who pioneered what became known as &#x27;combination football&#x27; in his native Glasgow, the intricate passing game he introduced was a revolutionary move for an English club in the late 1870s.

Villa began to establish themselves as one of the best teams in the Midlands, winning their first honour, the Birmingham Senior Cup in 1880. The club would go on to lift the trophy 9 times in the next 12 seasons.

=== Victorian and Edwardian golden age (1886–1914) ===
Following the professionalisation of football in 1885, the club decided that it needed a full-time paid manager. The following advert was placed in the Birmingham Daily Gazette newspaper in June 1886:

 Villa received 150 applicants for the role, but with his strong association with the club George Ramsay was the overwhelming choice of the membership. Thus on 26 June 1886, Aston Villa appointed what has been described as the world&#x27;s first professional football manager. 
The following season Aston Villa rose to national prominence, as the first Midlands team to win the FA Cup in 1887. Villa&#x27;s captain, the powerful Scottish centre-forward Archie Hunter became one of the game&#x27;s first household names, being the first player to score in every round of the FA Cup. Aston Villa were one of the dozen teams that competed in the inaugural Football League in 1888 with one of the club&#x27;s directors, William McGregor being the league&#x27;s founder. Following the professionalisation of football in 1885, clubs needed regular income to pay their players&#x27; wages. Frequently friendlies were cancelled due to opponents&#x27; FA Cup or county cup matches or clubs simply failed to honour a fixture in favour of a more lucrative match elsewhere. McGregor took action after seeing Villa matches cancelled, to the increasing frustration of the club&#x27;s fans, on five consecutive Saturdays. In March 1888, he wrote to the committee of his own club, Aston Villa, as well as to those of Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End and West Bromwich Albion, suggesting the creation of a league competition that would provide a number of guaranteed fixtures for its member clubs each season. Following two meetings between representatives of the leading clubs, the world&#x27;s first Football League season began in September 1888 with 12 member clubs from the Midlands and north of England: Accrington, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Burnley, Derby County, Everton, Notts County, Preston North End, Stoke, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Despite Villa founding the league, by 1893 they had yet to win it. Villa Committee Member Frederick Rinder was the instigator of a club meeting at Barwick Street in February 1893 that removed the committee running the club at the time. All fourteen committee members resigned and were replaced by a committee of five led by Rinder after he gave a rousing speech criticising the board&#x27;s tolerance of ill discipline and players&#x27; drinking. On the pitch, manager George Ramsay was moulding a team that became renowned for its short, quick combination passing which saw Villa win its first league title in 1893–94; the season after that the club won its second FA Cup in 1894-95. This was followed by back-to-back League titles in 1895–96 and 1896–97.

Aston Villa emerged as the most successful English club of the Victorian era, winning no fewer than five League titles and three FA Cups by the end of Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign in 1901. Villa&#x27;s captain during this era was Birmingham-born forward John Devey, who enjoyed a successful partnership with the lightning-fast winger Charlie Athersmith and marshalling Villa&#x27;s defence was the tough-tackling Scotsman James Cowan, who had an unrivalled sense of timing and anticipation. In 1897, the year Villa won The Double, they moved into their present home, the Aston Lower Grounds. Supporters coined the name &quot;Villa Park&quot;; no official declaration listed the ground as Villa Park.

Success continued into the Edwardian era, with Villa lifting the FA Cup for the fourth time in 1904–05, and a sixth league title in 1909–10. A further FA Cup triumph was achieved on the eve of the First World War in 1913, with the club narrowly missing out on winning a second Double, finishing runners-up in the league. Star-players during this era included Howard Spencer, the cultured defender who captained both Villa and England, and the prolific strike force of Joe Bache and Harry Hampton who between them scored 382 goals in claret and blue.

===Relative decline and first relegation (1920–1939)===

In January 1920, Billy Walker scored twice on his Villa debut in a 2–1 FA Cup first-round win over QPR; the club won the FA Cup for the sixth time that season and Walker went on to establish himself as Villa&#x27;s star player of the 1920s, scoring a record 244 goals in 531 appearances, captaining Villa and England. George Ramsay retired in 1926, at the age of 71, his replacement Billy Smith was unable to continue Ramsay&#x27;s success, in reality several other football clubs had caught up with Aston Villa, most notably Arsenal, who the club finished runners-up to in the league in 1930–31 and 1932–33. Despite missing out on the league title, Villa Park crowds were entertained by attacking football, the 128 goals scored in 1930–31, remains the all-time top-flight record to the present day. A remarkable 49 of the league goals that season were scored by centre-forward Tom &#x27;Pongo&#x27; Waring, with another 30 goals from winger Eric Houghton. 

The club appointed Jimmy McMullan as manager in 1934, however, the move proved disastrous, resulting in Villa&#x27;s first ever relegation in 1935–36 after 48 years in the top flight. Villa struggled largely due to a dismal defensive record: they conceded 110 goals in 42 games, 7 of them coming from Arsenal&#x27;s Ted Drake in an infamous 1–7 defeat at Villa Park. The club made seven signings and spent a staggering sum for the time of £35,500 trying to retain top-flight status at all costs, but were unable to buy their way out of trouble. Aston Villa, at the time one of the most famous and successful clubs in world football, was relegated in 1936 for the first time in its history.

Following relegation to the Second Division, the Villa board brought back the ageing former club chairman Fred Rinder, who said on his return &quot;Villa have been a great club, are still a great club, and always will be a great club&quot;. He was vocal in his criticism of the board for its &quot;almost total neglect of the reserve team, instead relying on paying big fees for ready made players&quot;. He believed that this change in policy from scouting and developing young homegrown talent led to a decline in the club&#x27;s culture and style of play, which alongside a tolerance of ill-discipline in the players led to Villa&#x27;s relegation. Rinder&#x27;s first act was to travel to Austria to recruit the progressive coach Jimmy Hogan as manager. Within two seasons, Hogan had guided Villa back to the top flight as Second Division champions playing attractive free-flowing football. Hogan outlined his philosophy: &quot;I am a teacher and lover of constructive football with every pass, every kick, every movement an object.&quot; He used to tell his players that &quot;football was like a Viennese waltz, a rhapsody. One-two-three, one-two-three, pass-move-pass, pass-move-pass.&quot; Unfortunately, the Second World War ended Hogan&#x27;s project to restore Aston Villa to the top of the English game.

=== Mediocrity and discontent (1945–1961) ===
Like all English clubs, Villa lost seven seasons to the Second World War, and that conflict brought several careers to a premature end. Bumper crowds flocked to Villa Park following the war, 76,588 people attended the FA Cup quarter-final between Villa and Derby County in March 1946, which is the all-time record attendance at Villa Park. The team was rebuilt under the guidance of former player Alex Massie for the remainder of the 1940s. Star players of this era included the one-club man Harry Parkes, the Welsh centre forward Trevor Ford and inside-forward Johnny Dixon, however the club only achieved mid-table finishes throughout the forties and fifties, never finishing higher than 6th place in the league. The board came in for increasing criticism during this time, with the 1953 AGM described by the Sports Argus as &quot;the longest and liveliest Villa meeting&quot;. Shareholders and supporters criticised the club&#x27;s lack of youth development, recruitment and training methods. When Danny Blanchflower put in a transfer request in 1954 he said that &quot;the club had grown fat and lazy on its old traditions and the decay was eating at the once solid foundations&quot;.

Despite narrowly avoiding relegation the season before, Aston Villa&#x27;s first trophy for 37 years came in the 1956–57 season when another former Villa player, Eric Houghton led the club to a then record seventh FA Cup Final win, defeating the &#x27;Busby Babes&#x27; of Manchester United 2–1 with Northern Irish winger Peter McParland scoring both goals. The team continued to struggle for consistency in the league though, which led to Eric Houghton being sacked in December 1958. His replacement Joe Mercer could not prevent the club being relegated for only the second time in their history in 1958-59. However, under the stewardship of Mercer, Villa returned to the top-flight in 1960 as Second Division Champions with a talented young side which became known as &#x27;Mercer&#x27;s Minors&#x27;. The following season Aston Villa became the first team to win the Football League Cup with England centre-forward Gerry Hitchens scoring an impressive 42 goals in 1960-61.

===Deep malaise and revival (1961–1974)===
Hitchens&#x27; goals brought him to the attention of Italian club Inter Milan, who offered him a large financial incentive to sign. He was sold for £85,000 in summer of 1961, his replacement, Derek Dougan was not a success and Villa slid backwards. Mercer&#x27;s forced retirement from the club in July 1964, following a stress-induced stroke, signalled a period of deep turmoil and malaise. The most successful club in England had failed to keep pace with changes in the modern game; three of the five-man board of directors were over 70 years old, the club had neglected its scouting network and coaching structure and the club&#x27;s finances were in a parlous state. This led to the club selling its top striker Tony Hateley to Chelsea for £100,000 in October 1966, without his goals Villa were relegated for the third time in its history, under manager Dick Taylor in 1967. The board even sold the club&#x27;s training ground outside Villa Park for housing, leaving the team in the position of training on borrowed training pitches of local factory teams.

The following season the fans called for the board to resign as Villa finished 16th in the Second Division. With mounting debts and Villa lying at the bottom of Division Two, the board sacked Tommy Cummings (the manager brought in to replace Taylor), and within weeks the entire board resigned under overwhelming pressure from fans. After much speculation, control of the club was bought by London financier Pat Matthews, who brought in Doug Ellis as chairman in December 1968. Ellis later recalled that &quot;you could write your name in the dust, window frames were rotting, the smell of failure and imminent financial ruin hung in the air&quot;; one of their first acts was to raise £205,835 in a share issue which cleared the club&#x27;s debts. Doug Ellis&#x27;s first managerial appointment was the outspoken Scottish manager Tommy Docherty, who after initial success, was sacked after 13 months in charge with the club at the foot of Second Division. His replacement was former club captain and reserve team manager Vic Crowe, who could not prevent Villa being relegated to the Third Division for the first time in its history at the end of the 1969–70 season.

The following season Villa surprised everyone by beating Manchester United in the two-legged semi-final to reach the 1971 League Cup Final, in which the team played well but were defeated by two late Tottenham Hotspur goals. There was a renewed sense of optimism at Villa Park as the club was promoted to the Second Division as champions with average attendances of 30,000 and a record 70 points in 1971–72 season. Off the pitch, the board purchased the new 20-acre Bodymoor Heath Training Ground in December 1971, with a view to improving the club&#x27;s youth development and coaching facilities.

=== Back among the elite (1974–1992) ===

Following a 14th-place finish in the Second Division, Crowe was replaced in August 1974 by Ron Saunders. He was a fitness fanatic, whose brand of no-nonsense man-management proved effective, with the club winning the League Cup the following season and, by the end of season 1974–75, he had taken Aston Villa back into the First Division and into Europe. One player who had been a mainstay of the Villa team throughout the rollercoaster of relegations and subsequent revival was fan-favourite Charlie Aitkin, who made 659 appearances at left back for the club between 1959 and 1976, making him Villa&#x27;s all-time record appearance holder.

Aston Villa were back among the elite as Saunders continued to mould a winning team, finishing 4th in the league and winning a further League Cup in 1976–77, with the formidable strike partnership of Brian Little and Andy Gray, who became the first player to win both the PFA Young Player of the Year and PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year in the same season.

The 1970s was an era of boardroom unrest at Villa Park. Ron Saunders had a strained relationship with Doug Ellis, resenting Doug&#x27;s perceived interference in football matters. Over time Ellis became an isolated figure on the board, as the other directors sided with Saunders. He was ousted as chairman in 1975 to make way for Sir William Dugdale. He remained on the board until 1979, when he left the club after a protracted power struggle with majority shareholder Ron Bendall. With Ellis gone, Saunders became all-powerful as manager.

Villa achieved a seventh top-flight league title in 1980–81, with players such as Gordon Cowans, Tony Morley and captain Dennis Mortimer leading the club to its first top-flight title in 71 years. Remarkably, they did so using just 14 players, with seven players being ever-presents. Villa&#x27;s Birmingham-born forward Gary Shaw was named 1980-1981 PFA Young Player of the Year.

To the surprise of commentators and fans, Ron Saunders quit halfway through the 1981–82 season, with Villa in the quarter final of the European Cup. Saunders had expressed his exasperation with the board at the lack of funds available to him to strengthen the team and fell out with the chairman Ron Bendall over the terms of his contract. He was replaced by his softly-spoken assistant manager Tony Barton who guided the club to a 1–0 victory over Bayern Munich in the European Cup final in Rotterdam courtesy of a Peter Withe goal in the 67th minute. Ten minutes into the final, Villa&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper, Jimmy Rimmer, was injured and young substitute keeper Nigel Spink was called into action, having only made one previous appearance in the first team. Spink performed superbly, keeping a clean sheet, and helping Villa become only the fourth English club to lift the European Cup. 

The following season the defence of the European Cup ended in a quarter-final defeat to Juventus, but Villa won the European Super Cup, beating Barcelona 3–1 on aggregate. This marked a pinnacle though and Villa&#x27;s fortunes declined sharply for most of the 1980s. Doug Ellis returned as chairman and majority shareholder in November 1982. The club was saddled with significant debts and questions had been raised by the police regarding fraudulent financial activity surrounding the building of the North Stand at Villa Park from 1980 to 1982. The cost of the work was £1.3 million. An internal investigation found that £700,000 of the £1.3 million worth of bills were unaccounted for. A later report by accountants Deloitte found that there were &quot;serious breaches of recommended codes of practice and poor site supervision&quot;. Ellis immediately set about trying to reduce the club&#x27;s overheads. He informed the players that they needed to take pay cuts and told the manager Tony Barton that there was a need to reduce the playing staff. Saunders&#x27; team was broken up and not adequately replaced, culminating in the club being relegated in 1987, just five years after Villa had been crowned European champions.

However, Villa bounced back quickly, achieving promotion the following year under Graham Taylor and a runners-up position in the top-flight in the 1989–90 season with a fine side that included Paul McGrath, Tony Daley and David Platt. Following this success, Graham Taylor accepted the offer to take over as England manager in 1990.

===24 years in the Premier League (1992–2016)===
Villa were one of the founding members of the Premier League in 1992, one of just three clubs to have been founding members of both the Football League in 1888 and the Premier League, along with Blackburn Rovers and Everton. Villa finished runners-up to Manchester United in the inaugural season under manager Ron Atkinson. His side lifted the League Cup in 1994, beating Manchester United 3–1 in the final, with goals from Dalian Atkinson and Dean Saunders, but the team struggled for form in the league and Atkinson was replaced by former Villa striker Brian Little in November 1994. Little assembled a young side which included players as Gareth Southgate, Steve Staunton, Ian Taylor and Dwight Yorke, leading the club to a fifth League Cup triumph in 1996, beating Leeds United 3–0 at Wembley. Villa finished fourth in the league that season, and fifth the season after.

Following a dip in form, Doug Ellis sacked Little and replaced him with another former Villa player John Gregory in February 1998. One of his first matches in charge was the UEFA Cup quarter-final against Atlético Madrid, which Villa lost on away goals over two-legs. In the summer of 1998, Yorke was transferred to Manchester United for £12.6 million. Gregory managed four top-eight finishes in the league and took the club to an FA Cup final in 2000 with a side that included David James, Dion Dublin, Paul Merson and Gareth Barry but was unable to assemble a team capable of challenging for Champions League places. At the end of the season Villa&#x27;s captain Gareth Southgate handed in a transfer request, claiming that &quot;if I am to achieve in my career, it is time to move on&quot;. Gregory&#x27;s frustration at the lack of investment in the team led to him publicly accusing Ellis of being &quot;stuck a time warp&quot;; their relationship remained strained until Gregory resigned in January 2002.

Ellis appointed Graham Taylor for a second spell in February 2002, but a 16th-place finish in the league led to his replacement with David O&#x27;Leary in June 2003. After a sixth-place finish in his first season, Villa the finished 10th and 16th, leading to O&#x27;Leary leaving in the summer of 2006. 
After 23 years as chairman and single biggest shareholder (approximately 38%), Ellis sold his stake in Aston Villa due to ill-health at the age of 82. American businessman Randy Lerner, owner of NFL franchise the Cleveland Browns, completed his takeover in September 2006. The arrival of a new owner in Lerner and of manager Martin O&#x27;Neill marked the start of a new period of optimism at Villa Park and sweeping changes occurred throughout the club including a new badge, investment in state-of-the-art facilities at the Bodymoor Heath Training Ground and significant investment in the squad in the summer of 2007. The first Cup final of the Lerner era came in 2010 when Villa were beaten 2–1 in the League Cup Final.

Just five days before the opening day of the 2010–11 season, O&#x27;Neill resigned as manager, despite three consecutive 6th-place finishes, due to frustration in the lack of investment in the squad, following the sale of star players Gareth Barry, James Milner and Ashley Young. His replacement Gérard Houllier stepped down due to ill-health in September 2011, to be replaced by Birmingham City manager Alex McLeish, despite fan protests against his appointment. McLeish&#x27;s contract was terminated at the end of the 2011–12 season after Villa finished in 16th place, and he was replaced by Paul Lambert.

In February 2012, the club announced a financial loss of £53.9 million, and Lerner put the club up for sale three months later. With Lerner still on board, but unwilling to spend following the stock market crash of 2008, the club was uncompetitive for several seasons, culminating in the 2014–15 season, when Lambert was sacked in February 2015 after the team managed just 12 goals in the first 25 league games, the lowest in Premier League history. Tim Sherwood succeeded him, and steered the club away from relegation while also leading them to the 2015 FA Cup Final. However, the club sold two of its star players Christian Benteke and captain Fabian Delph in the summer transfer window and did not adequately replace them. Villa struggled in the 2015–16 season, and Sherwood was sacked following six consecutive defeats. He was replaced by Rémi Garde, who left after just five months with Villa lying bottom of the table; his reign included a club-record 19 game winless run. The club was relegated at the end of the season, ending their 29-year stay in the top flight.

===Championship to Champions League (2016–present)===
In June 2016, Chinese businessman Tony Xia bought the club for £76 million. Former Chelsea boss Roberto Di Matteo was appointed as the club&#x27;s new manager, but was sacked after just 12 games following a poor start to the season. He was replaced by former Birmingham manager Steve Bruce. Bruce led the team to finish fourth in the 2017–18 season, but lost in the 2018 EFL Championship play-off final to Fulham.

Following failure to secure promotion to the Premier League, the club faced significant financial difficulties. Following rumours that administration was imminent, Xia looked to sell the club. On 20 July 2018 it was announced that the NSWE Group, a consortium consisting of Egyptian billionaire Nassef Sawiris and the American billionaire Wes Edens, were to invest in the football club. They purchased a controlling 55% stake in the club, and Sawiris took over the role of club chairman, appointing Christian Purslow as CEO.
In October 2018, Bruce was sacked after winning only once in a nine match stretch. He was replaced by Brentford manager and boyhood Villa fan Dean Smith, who led the team to fifth place, and reaching the playoffs again—helped on by a club-record 10 league game winning streak. They reached the 2019 EFL Championship play-off final and defeated Derby County 2–1 to gain promotion back to the Premier League after a three-year absence.

On the eve of Villa&#x27;s Premier League return, Recon Group&#x27;s minority share ownership was bought out by NSWE, meaning Xia no longer had any stake in the club. Villa&#x27;s first season back in the Premier League saw a significant overhaul of the squad, with 12 players signed during the summer transfer window. The team battled relegation for most of the season, but stayed up on the final day with a 17th-place finish. In Villa&#x27;s second season back in the Premier League, Smith oversaw an 11th-place finish, but was unable to persuade star player and captain Jack Grealish to remain at the club after Manchester City&#x27;s British-record £100 million bid triggered his release clause. Following a poor start to the 2021–22 season, which saw seven losses in the club&#x27;s opening 11 games, Dean Smith was dismissed.

Aston Villa appointed former Liverpool and England captain Steven Gerrard as head coach on 11 November 2021. After a poor start to the 2022–23 season, in which Villa won just twice and scored only seven goals in their opening 11 games, Gerrard was sacked in October 2022, and replaced by four-time Europa League-winning Spanish manager Unai Emery. He led Villa to 7th place and qualification for the Europa Conference League in his first season. In the 2023–24 season, Emery led the club to the Conference League semi-finals, and a 4th-place finish in the league, securing participation in the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1982–83.

== Colours and badge ==

The club colours are a claret shirt with sky blue sleeves, white shorts with claret and blue trim, and sky blue socks with claret and white trim. They were the original wearers of the claret and blue. Villa&#x27;s colours at the outset were royal blue caps and stockings, royal blue and scarlet &quot;striped&quot; (in the context of the time, hooped) jerseys, and white knickerbockers, one of the club rules including a provision that &quot;no member can take part in a match without wearing the above uniform&quot;. For a few years after that (1877–79) the team wore several different kits from all white, blue and black, red and blue to plain green. By 1880, black jerseys with a Scottish Lion Rampant embroidered on the chest were introduced by Villa&#x27;s Scottish leaders William McGregor and George Ramsay. This remained the first choice strip for six years. On Monday, 8 November 1886, an entry in the club&#x27;s official minute book states:

The chocolate colour later became claret. Nobody is quite sure why claret and blue became the club&#x27;s adopted colours. Several other football teams adopted their distinctive colours including West Ham United, Burnley, Scunthorpe United and Turkish club Trabzonspor. Crystal Palace also played in Villa&#x27;s colours until the 1970s.

A new badge was revealed in May 2007, for the 2007–08 season and beyond. The new badge includes a star to represent the European Cup win in 1982, and has a light blue background behind Villa&#x27;s &#x27;lion rampant&#x27;. The traditional motto &quot;Prepared&quot; remains in the badge, and the name Aston Villa has been shortened to AVFC, FC having been omitted from the previous badge. The lion is now unified as opposed to fragmented lions of the past. Randy Lerner petitioned fans to help with the design of the new badge.
On 6 April 2016, the club confirmed that it would be using a new badge from the 2016–17 season after consulting fan groups for suggestions. The lion in the new badge has claws added to it, and the word &quot;Prepared&quot; was removed to increase the size of the lion and club initials in the badge. In November 2022, following a fan-led vote, the club announced it would adopt a new badge for the following season. The new badge&#x27;s usage was later clarified to be exclusive to on-field kits and training wear by club president of business operations, Chris Heck, with the existing badge continuing to be utilized as the primary in all other channels. In May 2024, the club reverted to a shield-shaped badge.

=== Kit manufacturers and sponsors ===
Tables of kit suppliers and shirt sponsors appear below:

Aston Villa&#x27;s kit was produced by local manufacturers until 1974, when Umbro became the first kit supplier to have its logo on a Villa shirt. Aston Villa&#x27;s first shirt sponsor was Davenports Breweries in the 1982–83 season. Aston Villa forwent commercial kit sponsorship for the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons; instead advertising the charity Acorns Children&#x27;s Hospice, the first deal of its kind in Premier League history. The partnership continued until 2010 when a commercial sponsor replaced Acorns, with the hospice becoming the club&#x27;s Official Charity Partner. A shirt sleeve sponsor was used for the first time in the 2019–20 season with BR88 being displayed.

== Stadium ==


Aston Villa&#x27;s current home venue is Villa Park; the team previously played at Aston Park (1874–1876) and Wellington Road (1876–1897). Villa Park is the largest football stadium in the English Midlands, and the eighth largest stadium in England. It has hosted 16 England internationals at senior level, the first in 1899, and the most recent in 2005. Thus, it was the first English ground to stage international football in three different centuries. Villa Park is the most used stadium in FA Cup semi-final history, having hosted 55 semi-finals. In 2022, the club announced plans to rebuild the North Stand and part of the Trinity Road stand, which will take the maximum capacity over 50,000.

The current training ground is located at Bodymoor Heath near Kingsbury in north Warwickshire, the site for which was purchased by former chairman Doug Ellis in the early 1970s from a local farmer. Although Bodymoor Heath was state-of-the-art in the 1970s, by the late 1990s the facilities had started to look dated. In November 2005, Ellis and Aston Villa plc announced a state of the art £13 million redevelopment of Bodymoor in two phases. The new training ground was officially unveiled on 6 May 2007, by then manager Martin O&#x27;Neill, then team captain Gareth Barry and 1982 European Cup winning team captain Dennis Mortimer, with the Aston Villa squad moving in for the 2007–08 season.

It was announced on 6 August 2014, that Villa Park would appear in the FIFA video game from &quot;FIFA 15&quot;, with all other Premier League stadiums also fully licensed from this game onwards.

== Ownership ==

The first shares in the club were issued towards the end of the 19th century as a result of legislation that was intended to codify the growing numbers of professional teams and players in the Association Football leagues. FA teams were required to distribute shares to investors as a way of facilitating trading among the teams without implicating the FA itself. This trading continued for much of the 20th century until Ellis started buying up many of the shares in the 1960s. He was chairman and substantial shareholder of &quot;Aston Villa F.C.&quot; from 1968 to 1975 and the majority shareholder from 1982 to 2006. The club were floated on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in 1996, and the share price fluctuated in the ten years after the flotation. In 2006, it was announced that several consortia and individuals were considering bids for Aston Villa.

On 14 August 2006, it was confirmed that Randy Lerner, then owner of the National Football League&#x27;s Cleveland Browns, had reached an agreement of £62.6 million with Aston Villa for a takeover of the club. Lerner took full control on 18 September with Ellis and his board replaced with a new board by Lerner on 19 September 2006. Lerner appointed himself chairman of the club with Charles Krulak as a non-executive director and Ellis awarded the honorary position of Chairman Emeritus. Lerner put the club up for sale in May 2014, valuing it at an estimated £200 million.

On 18 May 2016, Randy Lerner agreed the sale of Aston Villa to Recon Group, owned by Chinese businessman Tony Xia. The sale was completed on 14 June 2016 for a reported £76 million, after being approved by the Football League. After a period of high expenditure and failing to secure promotion to the Premier League in the 2017–18 Championship playoff final, financial difficulties at the club began to mount. Amid rumours that Villa risked entering administration, Xia entered talks to sell the club in June 2018.

On 20 July 2018, it was announced that V Sports (at the time known as NSWE Group), a consortium consisting of Egyptian billionaire Nassef Sawiris and the American billionaire Wes Edens, were to invest in the football club. They purchased a controlling 55% stake in the club, and Sawiris took over the role of club chairman. On 9 August 2019, following Villa&#x27;s promotion to the Premier League, Companies House revealed that the remainder of Xia&#x27;s shares had been bought out, and that Xia no longer had any stake in the club.

On 15 December 2023, Aston Villa announced that Comcast-backed American investment firm Atairos would invest in V Sports, the ultimate parent company of the club. The agreement, which saw Atairos obtain a stake of approximately 20% in V Sports, valued Villa at more than £500 million. The deal with Atairos was finalised on 12 April 2024, with Atairos CEO and former Comcast CFO Michael Angelakis appointed to Villa&#x27;s board of directors.

== Social responsibility ==
Aston Villa has a unique relationship with the Acorns Children&#x27;s Hospice charity that is groundbreaking in English football. In a first for the Premier League, Aston Villa donated the front of its kit shirts, usually reserved for high-paying sponsorships, to Acorns Hospice so that the charity would gain significant additional visibility and more funds. Outside of the shirt sponsorship the club has paid for hospice care for the charity as well as regularly providing player visits to hospice locations.

In September 2010, Aston Villa launched an initiative at Villa Park called Villa Midlands Food (VMF) where the club will spend two years training students with Aston Villa hospitality and events in association with Birmingham City Council. The club opened a restaurant in the Trinity Road Stand staffed with 12 students recruited from within a 10-mile (16 km) radius of Villa Park with most of the food served in the restaurant sourced locally.

=== Aston Villa Foundation ===
In 2016, Aston Villa created a registered charity, the Aston Villa Foundation. The aim of the charity is to deliver the social responsibility work of Aston Villa. Working alongside key local and national stakeholders, the Foundation delivers projects such as football in the community, disability, health and wellbeing, education, interventions and community relations.

In May 2021, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge met with members of the Foundation at Aston Villa&#x27;s Bodymoor Heath Training Ground. This was following the Foundation providing 1000 hot meals a week to local organisations during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom as well as allowing a local NHS Trust to make use of Villa Park&#x27;s facilities.

== Supporters and rivalries ==
Aston Villa have a large fanbase and draw support from all over the Midlands and beyond, with supporters&#x27; clubs all across the world. Former Villa chief executive Richard Fitzgerald has stated that the ethnicity of the supporters is currently 98% white. When Randy Lerner&#x27;s regime took over at Villa Park, they aimed to improve the support from ethnic minorities. A number of organisations have been set up to support the local community, including Aston Pride. A Villa in the Community programme has also been set up to encourage support among young people in the region. The new owners have also initiated several surveys aimed at gaining the opinions of Villa fans and to involve them in the decision-making process. Meetings also occur every three months where supporters are invited by ballot and are invited to ask questions to the board. In 2011, the club supported a supporter-based initiative for an official anthem to boost the atmosphere at Villa Park. The song &quot;The Bells Are Ringing&quot; is to be played before games.

Like many English football clubs, Aston Villa has had several hooligan firms associated with it: Villa Youth, Steamers, Villa Hardcore and the C-Crew, the last mentioned being very active during the 1970s and 1980s. As can be seen across the whole of English football, the hooligan groups have now been marginalised. In 2004, several Villa firms were involved in a fight with QPR fans outside Villa Park in which a steward died. The main groupings of supporters can now be found in a number of domestic and international supporters&#x27; clubs. This includes the Official Aston Villa Supporters Club which also has many smaller regional and international sections. There were several independent supporters clubs during the reign of Doug Ellis but most of these disbanded after his retirement. The supporter group My Old Man Said formed to stand up for Villa supporters&#x27; rights, as a direct result of Villa supporters&#x27; protest against the club&#x27;s appointment of Alex McLeish. The club&#x27;s supporters also publish fanzines such as &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; and &quot;The Holy Trinity&quot;.

Aston Villa&#x27;s arch-rivals are Birmingham City, with games between the two clubs known as the Second City Derby. Historically though, West Bromwich Albion have arguably been Villa&#x27;s greatest rivals, a view highlighted in a fan survey, conducted in 2003. The two teams contested three FA Cup finals in the late 19th century. Villa also enjoy less heated local rivalries with Wolverhampton Wanderers and Coventry City. Through the relegation of West Brom and Birmingham City, to the Football League Championship, in the 2005–06 season, at the start of 2006–07 Premiership season, Villa were the only Midlands club in that League. The nearest opposing team Villa faced during that season was Sheffield United, who played away in South Yorkshire. For the 2010–11 season, West Bromwich Albion were promoted and joined Aston Villa, Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Birmingham City in the Premier League. This marked the first time that the &quot;West Midlands&#x27; Big Four&quot; clubs were in the Premier League at the same time, and the first time together in the top flight since the 1983–84 season. Birmingham were relegated at the end of the 2010–11 season, ending this period.

The rivalry with Birmingham City was renewed in 2016–17 when Aston Villa suffered relegation from the Premier League. They were joined by West Brom two years later, but Villa won promotion back to the Premier League in 2019.

In 2024, a supporter group named 1897 Group - named after the year that the club first used Villa Park as their home stadium - formed with the stated intention of vocally and visually enhancing the atmosphere for the club&#x27;s matches at Villa Park. Following a subsequent meeting with club officials, 1897 Group were allocated a section of seats in the stadium&#x27;s Doug Ellis Stand for a Premier League match against A.F.C. Bournemouth. This launched the group&#x27;s physical presence at matches. 
1897 Group also help to organise and carry out flag and tifo displays in Villa Park&#x27;s Holte End stand and also in other sections of the stadium for some Villa home matches. Additionally, they have also organised and promoted Villa fan marches where Villa supporters are encouraged by the group to congregate at a designated point in the town or city that Villa are playing in and walk all together to the stadium.

== Statistics ==
The 2024–25 campaign is Aston Villa&#x27;s 111th season in the top tier of English football. The only club to have spent longer in the top flight are Everton, with 122 seasons, making Aston Villa versus Everton the most-played fixture in English top-flight football. Aston Villa were relegated from the top tier of English football in 2016, having played in every Premier League season since its establishment in 1992–93, but were promoted back in 2018–19. They are ninth in the All-time FA Premier League table, and have the fifth highest total of major honours (20) won by an English club.

Aston Villa currently hold the record number of league goals scored by any team in the English top flight; 128 goals were scored in the 1930–31 season, one more than Arsenal who won the league that season for the first time, with Villa runners-up. Villa forward Archie Hunter became the first player to score in every round of the FA Cup in Villa&#x27;s victorious 1887 campaign. Villa&#x27;s longest unbeaten home run in the FA Cup spanned 13 years and 19 games, from 1888 to 1901.

Aston Villa are one of six English teams to have won the European Cup. They did so on 26 May 1982 in Rotterdam, beating Bayern Munich 1–0 thanks to Peter Withe&#x27;s goal. , Aston Villa are only surpassed by Tottenham Hotspur (79), for providing the most England internationals with 77 Villa players debuting for England since 1882.

== Honours ==

Aston Villa Football Club have won European and domestic league honours. The club&#x27;s last English honour was in 1996 when they won the League Cup, and most recently they won the 2001 UEFA Intertoto Cup.

There have been many players who can be called notable throughout Aston Villa&#x27;s history. These can be classified and recorded in several forms. The Halls of Fame and PFA Players of the Year are noted below. Aston Villa have had several players who were one-club men, including inaugural club Hall of Fame inductee Billy Walker. In 1998, to celebrate the 100th season of League football, The Football League released a list entitled the Football League 100 Legends that consisted of &quot;100 legendary football players&quot;. There were seven players included on the list who played for Villa: Danny Blanchflower, Trevor Ford, Archie Hunter, Sam Hardy, Paul McGrath, Clem Stephenson and Peter Schmeichel (who would go on to play for Villa three seasons later). Schmeichel was later inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2022, with former Villa captain and coach John Terry inducted in 2024.

Aston Villa have had a number of players who have been successful on the international stage while they were at the club. Paul McGrath and Steve Staunton (Republic of Ireland), as well as Olof Mellberg (Sweden) all captained their national sides in the 1990, 2002 and 2006 World Cups respectively. McGrath appeared nine times at the World Cup while at Aston Villa, a record for an active Villa player. Emiliano Martínez has won all his senior Argentina caps to date while at Aston Villa, having debuted in June 2021. He is currently the most decorated international player for Aston Villa having won the 2021 Copa América, the 2022 Finalissima, the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and the 2024 Copa América; he was awarded the &quot;Golden Glove&quot; awards at the 2021 and 2024 Copa América and the 2022 World Cup; he was twice named both the Best FIFA Goalkeeper and the Yashin Trophy winner between 2022 and 2024.

== In popular culture ==

An Aston Villa team were the subject, together with that of Sunderland, of one of the earliest football paintings in the world – possibly the earliest – when in 1895 the artist Thomas M. M. Hemy painted a picture of a game between the teams at Sunderland&#x27;s then ground Newcastle Road.

A number of television programmes have included references to Aston Villa over the past few decades. In the sitcom &quot;Porridge&quot;, the character Lennie Godber is a Villa supporter. When filming began on &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, Villa fan Ian Lavender was allowed to choose Frank Pike&#x27;s scarf from an array in the BBC wardrobe; he chose a claret and blue one – Aston Villa&#x27;s colours. The character Nessa in the BBC sitcom &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot; was revealed as an Aston Villa fan in an episode screened in December 2009.

In the 1952 film &quot;The Card&quot;, the main character Denry Machin (Alec Guinness) becomes a town councillor and purchases the rights to locally born Aston Villa player &#x27;Callear&#x27;, the &quot;greatest centre-forward in England&quot;, for the failing local football club.

Villa have also featured on several occasions in prose. Stanley Woolley, a character in Derek Robinson&#x27;s Booker shortlisted novel &quot;Goshawk Squadron&quot; is an Aston Villa fan and names a pre-war starting eleven Villa side. Together with The Oval, Villa Park is referenced by the poet Philip Larkin in his poem about the First World War, MCMXIV. Aston Villa are also mentioned in Harold Pinter&#x27;s play &quot;The Dumb Waiter&quot;.
The club receive a passing mention in Aldous Huxley&#x27;s debut novel &quot;Crome Yellow&quot;.

<text>Population transfer or resettlement is a type of mass migration that is often imposed by a state policy or international authority. Such mass migrations are most frequently spurred on the basis of ethnicity or religion, but they also occur due to economic development. Banishment or exile is a similar process, but is forcibly applied to individuals and groups. Population transfer differs more than simply technically from individually motivated migration, but at times of war, the act of fleeing from danger or famine often blurs the differences.

Often the affected population is transferred by force to a distant region, perhaps not suited to their way of life, causing them substantial harm. In addition, the process implies the loss of immovable property and substantial amounts of movable property when rushed. This transfer may be motivated by the more powerful party&#x27;s desire to make other uses of the land in question or, less often, by security or disastrous environmental or economic conditions that require relocation.

The first known population transfers date back to the Middle Assyrian Empire in the 13th century BCE, with forced resettlement being particularly prevalent during the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The single largest population transfer in history was the Partition of India in 1947 that involved up to 12 million people in Punjab Province with a total of up to 20 million people across British India, with the second largest being the flight and expulsion of Germans after World War II, which involved more than 12 million people.

Before the forcible deportation of Ukrainians (including thousands of children) to Russia during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the last major population transfer in Europe was the deportation of 800,000 ethnic Albanians during the Kosovo War in 1999. Moreover, some of the largest population transfers in Europe have been attributed to the ethnic policies of the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin.

Population transfers can also be imposed to further economic development, for instance China relocated 1.3 million residents in order to construct the Three Gorges Dam.

==Historical background==

The earliest known examples of population transfers took place in the context of war and empire. As part of Sennacherib&#x27;s campaign against King Hezekiah of Jerusalem (701 BCE) &quot;200,150 people great and small, male and female&quot; were transferred to other lands in the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Similar population transfers occurred under the Achaemenid and Byzantine Empires. Population transfers are considered incompatible with the values of post-Enlightenment European societies, but this was usually limited to the home territory of the colonial power itself and population transfers continued in European colonies during the 20th century.

==Specific types of population transfer==

===Population exchange===
Population exchange is the transfer of two populations in opposite directions at about the same time. In theory at least, the exchange is non-forcible, but the reality of the effects of these exchanges has always been unequal, and at least one half of the so-called &quot;exchange&quot; has usually been forced by the stronger or richer participant. Such exchanges have taken place several times in the 20th century:
* The partition of India and Pakistan
* The mass expulsion of Anatolian Greeks and Balkan Turks from Turkey and Greece, respectively, during their so-called Greek-Turkish population exchange. It involved approximately 1.3 million Anatolian Christians (majority Greek) and 354,000 Balkan Muslims (majority Turkish), most of whom were forcibly made refugees and &quot;de jure&quot; denaturalized from their homelands.
* The 1940 peaceful population exchange between Bulgaria and Romania
* The Cyprus population exchange following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 that led to displacement of 140,000 Greeks from the north and around 60,000 Turks that have relocated from the south to the north.
=== Ethnic dilution ===

Ethnic dilution is the practice of enacting immigration policies to relocate parts of an ethnically and/or culturally dominant population into a region populated by an ethnic minority or otherwise culturally different or non-mainstream group to dilute and eventually to transform the native ethnic population into the mainstream culture over time.

== Changes in international law==

According to the political scientist Norman Finkelstein, population transfer was considered as an acceptable solution to the problems of ethnic conflict until around World War II and even for a time afterward. Transfer was considered a drastic but &quot;often necessary&quot; means to end an ethnic conflict or ethnic civil war. The feasibility of population transfer was hugely increased by the creation of railroad networks from the mid-19th century. George Orwell, in his 1946 essay &quot;Politics and the English Language&quot; (written during the World War II evacuation and expulsions in Europe), observed:

:&quot;In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible. Things... can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness... Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: this is called &quot;transfer of population&quot; or &quot;rectification of frontiers&quot;.&quot;

The view of international law on population transfer underwent considerable evolution during the 20th century. Prior to World War II, many major population transfers were the result of bilateral treaties and had the support of international bodies such as the League of Nations. The expulsion of Germans after World War II from Central and Eastern Europe after World War II was sanctioned by the Allies in Article 13 of the Potsdam communiqué, but research has shown that both the British and the American delegations at Potsdam strongly objected to the size of the population transfer that had already taken place and was accelerating in the summer of 1945. The principal drafter of the provision, Geoffrey Harrison, explained that the article was intended not to approve the expulsions but to find a way to transfer the competence to the Control Council in Berlin to regulate the flow.
The tide started to turn when the Charter of the Nuremberg Trials of German Nazi leaders declared forced deportation of civilian populations to be both a war crime and a crime against humanity. That opinion was progressively adopted and extended through the remainder of the century. Underlying the change was the trend to assign rights to individuals, thereby limiting the rights of states to make agreements that adversely affect them.

There is now little debate about the general legal status of involuntary population transfers: &quot;Where population transfers used to be accepted as a means to settle ethnic conflict, today, forced population transfers are considered violations of international law.&quot; No legal distinction is made between one-way and two-way transfers since the rights of each individual are regarded as independent of the experience of others.

 of the Fourth Geneva Convention (adopted in 1949 and now part of customary international law) prohibits mass movement of protected persons out of or into territory under belligerent military occupation:
An interim report of the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities (1993) says:

The same report warned of the difficulty of ensuring true voluntariness:
&quot;some historical transfers did not call for forced or compulsory transfers, but included options for the affected populations. Nonetheless, the conditions attending the relevant treaties created strong moral, psychological and economic pressures to move.&quot;

The final report of the Sub-Commission (1997) invoked numerous legal conventions and treaties to support the position that population transfers contravene international law unless they have the consent of both the moved population and the host population. Moreover, that consent must be given free of direct or indirect negative pressure.

&quot;Deportation or forcible transfer of population&quot; is defined as a crime against humanity by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (Article 7). The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has indicted and sometimes convicted a number of politicians and military commanders indicted for forced deportations in that region.

Ethnic cleansing encompasses &quot;deportation or forcible transfer of population&quot; and the force involved may involve other crimes, including crimes against humanity. Nationalist agitation can harden public support, one way or the other, for or against population transfer as a solution to current or possible future ethnic conflict, and attitudes can be cultivated by supporters of either plan of action with its supportive propaganda used as a typical political tool by which their goals can be achieved.

==In Europe==
===France===
Two famous transfers connected with the history of France are the banning of the religion of the Jews in 1308 and that of the Huguenots, French Protestants by the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685. Religious warfare over the Protestants led to many seeking refuge in the Low Countries, England and Switzerland. In the early 18th century, some Huguenots emigrated to colonial America. In both cases, the population was not forced out but rather their religion was declared illegal and so many left the country.

According to Ivan Sertima, Louis XV ordered all blacks to be deported from France but was unsuccessful. At the time, they were mostly free people of color from the Caribbean and Louisiana colonies, usually descendants of French colonial men and African women. Some fathers sent their mixed-race sons to France to be educated or gave them property to be settled there. Others entered the military, as did Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, the father of Alexandre Dumas.

Some Algerians were also forcefully removed from their native land by France in the late 19th century, and moved to the Pacific, most notably to New Caledonia.

===Ireland===

After the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland and Act of Settlement in 1652, most indigenous Irish Catholic land holders had their lands confiscated and were banned from living in planted towns. An unknown number, possibly as high as 100,000 Irish were removed to the colonies in the West Indies and North America as indentured servants.

In addition, the Crown supported a series of population transfers into Ireland to enlarge the loyal Protestant population of Ireland. Known as the plantations, they had migrants come chiefly from Scotland and the northern border counties of England. In the late eighteenth century, the Scots-Irish constituted the largest group of immigrants from the British Isles to enter the Thirteen Colonies before the American Revolutionary War.

===Scotland===
The enclosures that depopulated rural England in the British Agricultural Revolution started during the Middle Ages. Similar developments in Scotland have lately been called the Lowland Clearances.

The Highland Clearances were forced displacements of the populations of the Scottish Highlands and Scottish Islands in the 18th century. They led to mass emigration to the coast, the Scottish Lowlands and abroad, including to the Thirteen Colonies, Canada and the Caribbean.

===Central Europe===

Historically, expulsions of Jews and of Romani people reflect the power of state control that has been applied as a tool, in the form of expulsion edicts, laws, mandates etc., against them for centuries.

After the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact divided Poland during World War II, Germans deported Poles and Jews from Polish territories annexed by Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union deported Poles from areas of Eastern Poland, Kresy to Siberia and Kazakhstan. From 1940, Adolf Hitler tried to get Germans to resettle from the areas in which they were the minority (the Baltics, South-Eastern and Eastern Europe) to the Warthegau, the region around Poznań, German &quot;Posen&quot;. He expelled the Poles and Jews who formed there the majority of the population. Before the war, the Germans were 16% of the population in the area.

The Nazis initially tried to press Jews to emigrate and in Austria succeeded in driving out most of the Jewish population. However, increasing foreign resistance brought the plan to a virtual halt. Later on, Jews were transferred to ghettoes and eventually to death camps. Use of forced labor in Nazi Germany during World War II occurred on a large scale. Jews who had signed over properties in Germany and Austria during Nazism, although coerced to do so, found it nearly impossible to be reimbursed after World War II, partly because of the ability of governments to make the &quot;personal decision to leave&quot; argument.

The Germans abducted about 12 million people from almost twenty European countries; about two thirds of whom came from Eastern Europe.
After World War II, when the Curzon line, which had been proposed in 1919 by the Western Allies as Poland&#x27;s eastern border, was implemented, members of all ethnic groups were transferred to their respective new territories (Poles to Poland, Ukrainians to Soviet Ukraine). The same applied to the formerly-German territories east of the Oder-Neisse line, where German citizens were transferred to Germany. Germans were expelled from areas annexed by the Soviet Union and Poland as well as territories of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and Yugoslavia. From 1944 until 1948, between 13.5 and 16.5 million Germans were expelled, evacuated or fled from Central and Eastern Europe. The Statistisches Bundesamt (federal statistics office) estimates the loss of life at 2.1 million 

Poland and Soviet Ukraine conducted population exchanges. Poles residing east of the new Poland-Soviet border were deported to Poland (2,100,000 persons), and Ukrainians that resided west of the New border were deported to Soviet Ukraine. Population transfer to Soviet Ukraine occurred from September 1944 to May 1946 (450,000 persons). Some Ukrainians (200,000 persons) left southeast Poland more or less voluntarily (between 1944 and 1945). The second event occurred in 1947 under Operation Vistula.

Nearly 20 million people in Europe fled their homes or were expelled, transferred or exchanged during the process of sorting out ethnic groups between 1944 and 1951.

===Spain===

In 1492 the Jewish population of Spain was expelled through the Alhambra Decree. Some of the Jews went to North Africa; others east into Poland, France and Italy, and other Mediterranean countries.

In 1609, was the Expulsion of the Moriscos, the final transfer of 300,000 Muslims out of Spain, after more than a century of Catholic trials, segregation, and religious restrictions. Most of the Spanish Muslims went to North Africa and to areas of Ottoman Empire control.

===Southeastern Europe===
In September 1940, with the return of Southern Dobruja by Romania to Bulgaria under the Treaty of Craiova, a population exchange was carried out. 103,711 Romanians, Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians were compelled to move north of the border, while 62,278 Bulgarians living in Northern Dobruja were forced to move into Bulgaria.

Around 360,000 Bulgarian Turks fled Bulgaria during the Revival Process.

During the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s, the breakup of Yugoslavia caused large population transfers, mostly involuntary. As it was a conflict fueled by ethnic nationalism, people of minority ethnicities generally fled towards regions that their ethnicity was the majority.

The phenomenon of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; was first seen in Croatia but soon spread to Bosnia. Since the Bosnian Muslims had no immediate refuge, they were arguably the hardest hit by the ethnic violence. United Nations tried to create &quot;safe areas&quot; for Muslim populations of eastern Bosnia but in the Srebrenica massacre and elsewhere, the peacekeeping troops failed to protect the &quot;safe areas&quot;, resulting in the massacre of thousands of Muslims.

The Dayton Accords ended the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, fixing the borders between the two warring parties roughly to those established by the autumn of 1995. One immediate result of the population transfer after the peace deal was a sharp decline in ethnic violence in the region.

A massive and systematic deportation of Serbia&#x27;s Albanians took place during the Kosovo War of 1999, with around 800,000 Albanians (out of a population of about 1.5 million) forced to flee Kosovo. Albanians became the majority in Kosovo at the wars end, around 200,000 Serbs and Roma fled Kosovo. When Kosovo proclaimed independence in 2008, the bulk of its population was Albanian.

A number of commanders and politicians, notably Serbia and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević, were put on trial by the UN&#x27;s International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for a variety of war crimes, including deportations and genocide.

===Greece and Turkey===

Following the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, the League of Nations defined those to be mutually expelled as the &quot;Muslim inhabitants of Greece&quot; to Turkey and moving &quot;the Christian Orthodox inhabitants of Turkey&quot; to Greece. The plan met with fierce opposition in both countries and was condemned vigorously by a large number of countries. Undeterred, Fridtjof Nansen worked with both Greece and Turkey to gain their acceptance of the proposed population exchange. About 1.5 million Christians and half a million Muslims were moved from one side of the international border to the other.

When the exchange was to take effect (1 May 1923), most of the prewar Orthodox Greek population of Aegean Turkey had already fled due to persecution and the Greek Genocide, and so only the Orthodox Christians of central Anatolia (both Greek and Turkish-speaking), and the Pontic Greeks were involved, a total of roughly 189,916. The total number of Muslims involved was 354,647.

The population transfer prevented further attacks on minorities in the respective states, and Nansen was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize. As a result of the transfers, the Muslim minority in Greece and the Greek minority in Turkey were much reduced. Cyprus and the Dodecanese were not included in the Greco-Turkish population transfer of 1923 because they were under direct British and Italian control respectively. For the fate of Cyprus, see below. The Dodecanese became part of Greece in 1947.

===Italy===
In 1939, Hitler and Mussolini agreed to give the German-speaking population of South Tyrol a choice (the South Tyrol Option Agreement): they could emigrate to neighbouring Germany (including the recently-annexed Austria) or stay in Italy and accept to be assimilated. Because of the outbreak of World War II, the agreement was only partially consummated.

===Cyprus===

After the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and subsequent division of the island, there was an agreement between the Greek representative on one side and the Turkish Cypriot representative on the other side under the auspices of the United Nations on August 2, 1975. The Government of the Republic of Cyprus would lift any restrictions in the voluntary movement of Turkish Cypriots to the Turkish-occupied areas of the island, and in exchange, the Turkish Cypriot side would allow all Greek Cypriots who remained in the occupied areas to stay there and to be given every help to live a normal life.

Around 150,000 people (amounting to more than one-quarter of the total population of Cyprus, and to one-third of its Greek Cypriot population) were displaced from the northern part of the island, where Greek Cypriots had constituted 80% of the population. Over the course of the next year, roughly 60,000 Turkish Cypriots, amounting to half the Turkish Cypriot population, were displaced from the south to the north.

===Soviet Union===

Shortly before, during and immediately after World War II, Joseph Stalin conducted a series of deportations on a huge scale, which profoundly affected the ethnic map of the Soviet Union. Over 1.5 million people were deported to Siberia and the Central Asian republics. Separatism, resistance to Soviet rule and collaboration with the invading Germans were cited as the main official reasons for the deportations. After World War II, the population of East Prussia was replaced by the Soviet one, mainly by Russians. Many Tartari Muslims were transferred to Northern Crimea, now Ukraine, while Southern Crimea and Yalta were populated with Russians.

At the conclusion of the Yalta Conference, the Allies made numerous promises, one of them was their promise to return all Soviet citizens who found themselves in the Allied zone to the Soviet Union (Operation Keelhaul). That policy immediately affected the Soviet prisoners of war who were liberated by the Allies, and it was extended to all Eastern European refugees. Outlining the plan to force refugees to return to the Soviet Union, the codicil was kept secret from the American and British people for over 50 years.

===Ukraine===
Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have reportedly been forcibly deported to Russia during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Because of Russia&#x27;s deporting of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia, the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin the president of Russia and Maria Lvova-Belova Russia&#x27;s commissioner for children&#x27;s rights. As of 21 November 2023 there was 6,338,100 Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Most (5,946,000) have gone to European countries but a minority (392,100) went to countries outside of Europe

==In the Americas==
===Inca Empire===

The Inca Empire dispersed conquered ethnic groups throughout the empire to break down traditional community ties and force the heterogeneous population to adopt the Quechua language and culture. Never fully successful in the pre-Columbian era, the totalitarian policies had their greatest success when they were adopted, from the 16th century, to create a pan-Andean identity defined against Spanish rule. Much of the current knowledge of Inca population transfers comes from their description by the Spanish chroniclers Pedro Cieza de León and Bernabé Cobo.

The Spanish conquerors continued these Inca policies settling for example thousands of indigenous yanakuna from what is today Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru in the newly conquered central Chile. In 1666 the Spanish resettled the Quilmes people from the vicinity of San Miguel de Tucumán more than 1,000 km southeast in Quilmes next to Buenos Aires.

===Canada===

During the French and Indian War (the North American theatre of the Seven Years&#x27; War between Great Britain and France), the British forcibly relocated approximately 8,000 Acadians from the Canadian Maritime Provinces, first to the Thirteen Colonies and then to France. Thousands died of drowning, starvation, or illness as a result of the deportation. Some of the Acadians who had been relocated to France then emigrated to Louisiana, where their descendants became part of the French-American cultural group known as Cajuns.

Beginning with the Indian Act, but underlying federal and provincial policies towards Indigenous peoples throughout the 1800s and 1900s, the Canadian Government pursued a deliberate policy of forced relocation against hundreds of Indigenous communities. The Canadian Indian residential school system and the Indian reserve system (which forced Indigenous peoples off traditional territories and into small parcels of crown land in order to establish agricultural and industrial developments, and to begin the process of settler colonialism) are key to this history and have been seen by many scholars as evidence of the government&#x27;s intent to &quot;extinguish Aboriginal title through administrative and bureaucratic means&quot;. The efforts to displace Indigenous peoples from their traditional territories were also carried out by more brutal means. The Pass system, which controlled the supply of food and resources, movement in and out of reserve lands, and all other aspects of Indigenous peoples&#x27; lives, was implemented via the Indian Act in direct response to the 1885 North-West Rebellion, in which Cree, Metis, and other Indigenous peoples resisted the seizure of land and rights by the government. The North-West Mounted Police, precursor to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, were likewise established as a direct response to Indigenous resistance against colonialism. Their purview was to carry out John A. Macdonald&#x27;s colonial and national policies, especially in Rupert&#x27;s Land, what would become the Prairie provinces. 

The High Arctic relocation took place during the Cold War in the 1950s, when 87 Inuit were moved by the Government of Canada to the High Arctic. The relocation has been a source of controversy, and is an understudied aspect of forced migration instigated by the Canadian federal government to assert its sovereignty in the Far North against the Soviet Union. Relocated Inuit peoples were not given sufficient support and were not given a say in their relocation.

Numerous other indigenous peoples of Canada have been forced to relocate their communities to different reserve lands, including the &#x27;Nak&#x27;waxda&#x27;xw in 1964.

====Japanese Canadian internment====

Japanese Canadian Internment refers to the detainment of Japanese Canadians following the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Canadian declaration of war on Japan during World War II. The forced relocation subjected Japanese Canadians to government-enforced curfews and interrogations and job and property losses. The internment of Japanese Canadians was ordered by Prime Minister Mackenzie King, largely because of existing racism. However, evidence supplied by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Department of National Defence show that the decision was unwarranted.

Until 1949, four years after World War II had ended, all persons of Japanese heritage were systematically removed from their homes and businesses and sent to internment camps. The Canadian government shut down all Japanese-language newspapers, took possession of businesses and fishing boats, and effectively sold them. To fund the internment itself, vehicles, houses, and personal belongings were also sold.

===United States===
====Independence====
During and after the American Revolutionary War, many Loyalists were deprived of life, liberty or property or suffered lesser physical harm, sometimes under acts of attainder and sometimes by main force. Parker Wickham and other Loyalists developed a well-founded fear. As a result, many chose or were forced to leave their former homes in what became the United States, often going to Canada, where the Crown promised them land in an effort at compensation and resettlement. Most were given land on the frontier in what became Upper Canada and had to create new towns. The communities were largely settled by people of the same ethnic ancestry and religious faith. In some cases, towns were started by men of particular military units and their families.

====Native American relocations====

In the 19th century, the United States government removed an estimated number of 100,000 Native Americans to federally-owned and -designated Indian reservations. Native Americans were removed from the Eastern to the Western States. The most well-known removals were those of the 1830s from the Southeast, starting with the Choctaw people. Under the 1830 Indian Removal Act, the Five Civilized Tribes were relocated from their place, east of the Mississippi River, to the Indian Territory in the west. The process resulted in great social dislocation for all, numerous deaths, and the &quot;Trail of Tears&quot; for the Cherokee Nation. Resistance to Indian removal led to several violent conflicts, including the Second Seminole War in Florida.

As part of the California Genocide, in August 1863, all Konkow Maidu were to be sent to the Bidwell Ranch in Chico and then be taken to the Round Valley Reservation at Covelo in Mendocino County. Any Indians remaining in the area were to be shot. Maidu were rounded up and marched under guard west out of the Sacramento Valley and through to the Coastal Range. 461 Native Americans started the trek, 277 finished. They reached Round Valley on 18 September 1863.

The Long Walk of the Navajo refers to the 1864 relocation of the Navajo people by the US government in a forced walk from their land in what is now Arizona to eastern New Mexico. The Yavapai people were forcibly marched from Camp Verde Reservation to San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation, Arizona, on February 27, 1875, following the Yavapai War. The federal government restricted Plains Indians to reservations following several Indian Wars in which Indians and European Americans fought over lands and resources. Indian prisoners of war were held at Fort Marion and Fort Pickens in Florida.

After the Yavapai Wars 375 Yavapai perished in Indian Removal deportations out of 1,400 remaining Yavapai.

====General Order No. 11 (1863)====

General Order No. 11 is the title of a Union Army decree which was issued during the American Civil War on 25 August 1863, forcing the evacuation of rural areas in four counties in western Missouri. That decree was issued in response to an extensive insurgency and widespread guerrilla warfare. The Army cleared the area in an attempt to deprive the guerrillas of local support. Union General Thomas Ewing issued the order, which affected all rural residents regardless of their loyalty. Those who could prove their loyalty to the Union were permitted to stay in the region but had to leave their farms and move to communities near military outposts. Those who could not do so had to vacate the area altogether.

In the process, Union forces caused considerable property destruction and a large number of deaths because of conflicts.

====Japanese American internment====
In the wake of Imperial Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor, decades-long suspicions and antagonisms towards ethnic Japanese mounted, causing the US government to order the military to forcibly relocate approximately 110,000 Japanese Americans along with Japanese nationals who were residing in the United States to newly constructed &quot;War Relocation Camps,&quot; or internment camps, in 1942, where they were interned for the duration of the war. White Americans frequently bought their property at losses.

Japanese nationals and Japanese Americans who were residing on the West Coast of the United States were all interned. In Hawaii, where more than 150,000 Japanese Americans composed nearly a third of that territory&#x27;s population, officials only interned 1,200 to 1,800 Japanese Americans. In the late 20th century, the US government paid some compensation to the survivors of the internment camps.

==In Asia==
===Ottoman Empire===

The Ottoman Empire colonized newly conquered territories by deportation (&quot;sürgün&quot;) and resettlement, often to populate empty lands and establish settlements in logistically useful places. The term &quot;sürgün&quot; is known to us from Ottoman documents and comes from the verb &quot;sürmek&quot; (to displace). This type of resettlement primarily aimed to support daily governance of the Empire, but sometimes population transfers had ethnic or political concerns.

During Mehmet I&#x27;s reign Tatar and Turkmen subjects were moved to the Balkans to secure areas along the border with Christian Europe. Conquered Christians were moved to Anatolia and Thrace. These population transfers continued into the reigns of Murad II and Mehmet II.

After Murad II&#x27;s conquest of Salonika, Muslims were involuntarily relocated to Salonika, mostly from Anatolia and Yenice-i Vardar.

Mehmed the Conqueror resettled not only Muslims, but Christians and Jews as well, in his efforts to repopulate the city of Constantinople after its conquest in 1453.

According to the deportation decree issued in newly conquered Cyprus on 24 September 1572, one family out of every ten in the provinces of Anatolia, Rum (Sivas), Karaman and Zülkadriye were to be sent to Cyprus. These deportees were craftsmen or peasants. In exchange for relocating they would be exempt from taxes for two years.

From Bayezid II (d. 1512), the empire had difficulty with the heterodox Qizilbash movement in eastern Anatolia. The forced relocation of the Qizilbash continued until at least the end of the 16th century. Selim I (d. 1520) ordered merchants, artisans, and scholars transported to Constantinople from Tabriz and Cairo. The state mandated Muslim immigration to Rhodes and Cyprus after their conquests in 1522 and 1571, respectively, and resettled Greek Cypriots onto Anatolia&#x27;s coast.

Knowledge among Western historians about the use of &quot;sürgün&quot; from the 17th through the 19th century is somewhat unreliable. It appears that the state did not use forced population transfers as much as during its expansionist period.

After the exchanges in the Balkans, the Great Powers and then the League of Nations used forced population transfer as a mechanism for homogeneity in the post-Ottoman Balkans to decrease conflict. The Norwegian diplomat Fridtjof Nansen, working with the League of Nations as a High Commissioner for Refugees in 1919, proposed the idea of a forced population transfer. That was modelled on the earlier Greek-Bulgarian mandatory population transfer of Greeks in Bulgaria to Greece and of Bulgarians in Greece to Bulgaria.

===Palestine===

The 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, also known as &quot;the Nakba&quot;, was the ethnic cleansing of around 750,000 Palestinian Arabs during the 1948 Palestine war from the part of Mandatory Palestine that became Israel. The bulk of the Palestinian refugees ended up in the Gaza Strip (under Egyptian rule between 1949 and 1967) and the West Bank (under Jordanian rule between 1949 and 1967), Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.

During the war, the Haganah devised Plan Dalet, which some scholars interpret to have been primarily aimed at ensuring the expulsion of Palestinians, but that interpretation is disputed. Efraim Karsh states that most of the Arabs who fled left of their own accord or were pressured to leave by their fellow Arabs despite Israeli attempts to convince them to stay.

The idea of the transfer of Arabs from Palestine had been considered about half a century beforehand.

For example, Theodor Herzl wrote in his diary in 1895 that the Zionist movement &quot;shall try to spirit the penniless population across the border by procuring employment for it in the transit countries, while denying it any employment in our country.&quot; That interpretation of Herzl has been disputed. Forty years later, one of the recommendations in the Report of the British Peel Commission in 1937 was for a transfer of Arabs from the area of the proposed Jewish state, and it even included a compulsory transfer from the plains of Palestine. That recommendation was not initially objected to by the British Government.

Scholars have debated David Ben-Gurion&#x27;s views on transfer, particularly in the context of the 1937 Ben-Gurion letter, but according to Benny Morris, Ben-Gurion &quot;elsewhere, in unassailable statements... repeatedly endorsed the idea of “transferring” (or expelling) Arabs, or the Arabs, out of the area of the Jewish state-to-be, either &quot;voluntarily&quot; or by compulsion.&quot;

Gush Etzion and Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem were depopulated by following the Jordanian annexation of the West Bank. The population was absorbed by the new State of Israel; and many of the locations were repopulated after the Six-Day War in 1967. During that war, Arabs again faced mass displacement, known as the Naksa. Estimates range between 280,000 and 325,000 displaced, many of whom had been living in the West Bank after being expelled or fleeing there during the Nakba between 1947 and 1949.

===Persia===
Removal of populations from along their borders with the Ottomans in Kurdistan and the Caucasus was of strategic importance to the Safavids. Hundreds of thousands of Kurds, along with large groups of Armenians, Assyrians, Azeris, and Turkmens, were forcibly removed from the border regions and resettled in the interior of Persia.That was a means of cutting off contact with other members of the groups across the borders as well as limiting passage of peoples. Under Tahmasp I the Safavids deported a huge portion of the Kurdish population in Anatolia to Khorasan, creating the modern Khorasani Kurds. Some Kurdish tribes were deported farther east, into Gharjistan in the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan, about 1500 miles away from their former homes in western Kurdistan.

===Ancient Assyria===
In the ancient world, population transfer was the more humane alternative to putting all the males of a conquered territory to death and enslaving the women and children. From the 13th century BCE, Assyria used mass deportation as a punishment for rebellions. By the 9th century BCE, the Assyrians regularly deported thousands of restless subjects to other lands. Assyria forcibly resettled the inhabitants of the Northern Kingdom of Israel in 720 BCE; these became known as the Ten Lost Tribes.

===Indian subcontinent===
When British India was going through an independence movement prior to the Second World War, some pro-Muslim organisations (most notably the Muslim League) demanded a Muslim state consisting of two non-contiguous territories: East Pakistan and West Pakistan. To facilitate the creation of new states along religious lines (as opposed to racial or linguistic lines as people shared common histories and languages), population exchanges between India and Pakistan were implemented. More than 5 million Hindus and Sikhs moved from present-day Pakistan to present-day India, and the same number of Muslims moved the other way. A large number of people, more than a million by some estimates, died in the accompanying violence. Despite the movement of large number of Muslims to Pakistan, an equal number of Muslims chose to stay in India. However, most of the Hindu and Sikh population in Pakistan moved to India in the following years. The Muslim immigrants to Pakistan mostly settled in Karachi and became known as the Urdu speaking Muhajir community.

From 1989 to 1992, the ethnic Hindu Kashmiri Pandit population was forcibly moved out of Kashmir by a minority Urdu-speaking Muslims. The imposition of Urdu led to a decline of usage of local languages such as Kashmiri and Dogri. The resultant violence led to the death of many Hindus and the exodus of nearly all Hindus.

On the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia between 1967 and 1973, the British government forcibly removed 2000 Chagossian islanders to make way for a U.S. Armed Forces base. Despite court judgments in their favour, they have not been allowed to return from their exile in Mauritius, but there are signs that financial compensation and an official apology are being considered by the British government.

===Afghanistan===

In the 1880s, Abdur Rahman Khan moved the rebellious Ghilzai Pashtuns from the southern part of the country to the northern part. In addition, Abdur Rahman and his successors encouraged Pashtuns, with various incentives, to settle into northern Afghanistan in the late 19th and 20th centuries.

===Cambodia===

One of the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s first acts was to move most of the urban population into the countryside. Phnom Penh, its population of 2.5 million people including as many as 1.5 million wartime refugees living with relatives or in urban area, was soon nearly empty. Similar evacuations occurred at Battambang, Kampong Cham, Siem Reap, Kampong Thom and throughout the country&#x27;s other towns and cities. The Khmer Rouge attempted to turn Cambodia into a classless society by depopulating cities and forcing the urban population (&quot;New People&quot;) into agricultural communes. The entire population was forced to become farmers in labor camps.

===Caucasia===

In the Caucasian region of the former Soviet Union, ethnic population transfers have affected many thousands of individuals in Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan proper; in Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Georgia proper and in Chechnya and adjacent areas within Russia.

===Middle East===
* During the Kurdish rebellions in Turkey from 1920 and until 1937, hundreds of thousands of Kurdish refugees were forced to relocate.
* After the creation of the State of Israel and the Israel Independence War, a strong wave of anti-Semitism in the Arab countries forced many Jews to flee to Europe, the Americas and Israel. The number estimated is between 850,000 and 1,000,000 people. Those who arrived to Israel were put in refugee camps until the state had helped them to recover.
* Up to 3,000,000 people, mainly Kurds, have been displaced in the Kurdish–Turkish conflict, an estimated 1,000,000 of which were still internally displaced as of 2009.
* For decades, Saddam Hussein forcibly Arabized northern Iraq. Sunni Arabs drove out at least 70,000 Kurds from western Mosul to replace them with Sunni Arabs. Now, only eastern Mosul is Kurdish.
* During the First Gulf War, a survey reported that 732,000 Yemeni immigrants were forced to leave Gulf Countries to return to Yemen. Most of them had been in Saudi Arabia.
* After the First Gulf War, Kuwaiti authorities expelled nearly 200,000 Palestinians from Kuwait. That was partly a response to the alignment of PLO leader Yasser Arafat with Saddam Hussein.
* In August 2005, Israel forcibly transferred all 10,000 Israeli settlers from the Gaza Strip and the north of the West Bank.
* About 6.5 million Syrian refugees moved within the country, and 4.3 million left for neighboring countries because of the Syrian Civil War. Many were displaced by the fighting, with forced expulsions taking place against both Sunni Arabs and Alawites.

==In Africa==
=== Algeria ===
===Ethiopia===

In the context of the 1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia thousands of people were resettled from northern to southern Ethiopia. The official reason given by the government was that people would be moved from the drought-affected northern regions to the south and south-west, where arable land was plentiful. Others argued that resettlement was a ploy to depopulate areas of unrest in the Ethiopian Civil War.

===South Africa===

African people from across southern Africa were forced to move into &#x27;homelands&#x27; or Bantustan, which were territories that the white National Party administration of South Africa set aside for black inhabitants of South Africa and South West Africa (now Namibia), as part of its policy of apartheid.

<text>An entity is something that exists as itself. It does not need to be of material existence. In particular, abstractions and legal fictions are usually regarded as entities. In general, there is also no presumption that an entity is animate, or present.

The term is broad in scope and may refer to animals; natural features such as mountains; inanimate objects such as tables; numbers or sets as symbols written on a paper; human contrivances such as laws, corporations and academic disciplines; or supernatural beings such as gods and spirits.

The adjectival form is &quot;entitative&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;entity&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;entitas&quot;, which in turn derives from the Latin &quot;ens&quot; meaning &quot;being&quot; or &quot;existing&quot; (compare English &quot;essence&quot;). &quot;Entity&quot; may hence literally be taken to mean &quot;thing which exists&quot;.

== In philosophy ==

Ontology is the study of concepts of existence, and of recognition of entities. The words ontic and entity are derived respectively from the ancient Greek and Latin present participles that mean &quot;being&quot;.

== In law and politics ==

In law, a legal entity is an entity that is capable of bearing legal rights and obligations, such as a natural person or an artificial person (e.g. business entity or a corporate entity).

In politics, &quot;entity&quot; is used as term for territorial divisions of some countries (e.g. Bosnia and Herzegovina).

== In medicine ==

In medicine, a disease entity is an illness due to a particular definite cause or to a specific pathological process. While a disease entity is not defined by a syndrome, it may or may not be manifest in one or more particular syndromes. 

== In computer science ==

In computer science, an entity is an object that has an identity, which is independent of the changes of its attributes. It represents long-lived information relevant for the users and is usually stored in a database.

<doc id="42178" wikidata="Q173347" url="?curid=42178" title="Éamon de Valera">
<text>Éamon de Valera (, ; first registered as George de Valero; changed some time before 1901 to Edward de Valera; 14 October 1882 – 29 August 1975) was an American-born Irish statesman and political leader. He served several terms as head of government and head of state and had a leading role in introducing the 1937 Constitution of Ireland.

De Valera was a commandant of the Irish Volunteers (Third Battalion) at Boland&#x27;s Mill during the 1916 Easter Rising. He was arrested and sentenced to death, but released for a variety of reasons, including his American citizenship and the public response to the British execution of Rising leaders. He returned to Ireland after being jailed in England and became one of the leading political figures of the War of Independence. After the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, de Valera served as the political leader of Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin until 1926, when he, along with many supporters, left the party to set up Fianna Fáil, a new political party which abandoned the policy of abstentionism from Dáil Éireann.

From there, de Valera went on to be at the forefront of Irish politics until the turn of the 1960s. He took over as president of the Executive Council from W. T. Cosgrave and later became Taoiseach, with the adoption of the Constitution of Ireland in 1937. He served as Taoiseach on three different occasions: from 1937 to 1948, from 1951 to 1954, and finally from 1957 to 1959. He remains the longest serving Taoiseach by total days served in the post. He resigned in 1959 upon his election as president of Ireland. By then, he had been Leader of Fianna Fáil for 33 years and he, along with older founding members, began to take a less prominent role relative to newer ministers such as Jack Lynch, Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney. De Valera served as President of Ireland from 1959 to 1973, two full terms in office.

De Valera&#x27;s political beliefs evolved from militant Irish republicanism to strong social, cultural and fiscal conservatism. He has been characterised as having a stern and unbending, and also devious demeanour. His roles in the Civil War have also been interpreted as making him a divisive figure in Irish history. Biographer Tim Pat Coogan sees his time in power as being characterised by economic and cultural stagnation, while Diarmaid Ferriter argues that the stereotype of de Valera as an austere, cold, and even backward figure was largely manufactured in the 1960s and is misguided.

==Early life==
Éamon de Valera was born on 14 October 1882 in Lenox Hill, New York. the son of Catherine Coll, who was originally from Bruree, County Limerick, and Juan Vivion de Valera, described on the birth certificate as a Spanish artist born in 1853. Some researchers have placed his father&#x27;s place of birth in Cuba, while others have suggested other locations; according to Antonio Rivero Taravillo, he was born in Seville, while Ronan Fanning has him born in the Basque Country.

He was born at the Nursery and Child&#x27;s Hospital, Lexington Avenue, a home for destitute orphans and abandoned children.
His parents were reportedly married on 18 September 1881 at St Patrick&#x27;s Church in Jersey City, New Jersey, but archivists have not located any marriage certificate or any birth, baptismal, or death certificate information for anyone called Juan Vivion de Valera (nor for &quot;de Valeros&quot;, an alternative spelling). On de Valera&#x27;s original birth certificate, his name is given as George de Valero and his father is listed as Vivion de Valero. Although he was known as Edward de Valera before 1901, an amended birth certificate was issued, when de Valera was an adult, in which his first name was updated to Edward and his father&#x27;s surname given as &quot;de Valera&quot;. As a child, he was known as &quot;Eddie&quot; or &quot;Eddy&quot;. An article, published in 2024 in the &quot;Journal of the Westmeath Archaeological and History Society&quot;, suggested that de Valera&#x27;s baptismal record and birth certificate were forged by Irish nationalists in New York City in 1916 as part of an effort to spare him from execution.

According to Coll, Juan Vivion died in 1885 leaving Coll and her child in poor circumstances. Éamon was taken to Ireland by his uncle Ned at the age of two. When his mother remarried in the mid-1880s, he was not brought back to live with her, but was reared by his grandmother, Elizabeth Coll, her son Patrick and her daughter Hannie, in Bruree, County Limerick. He was educated locally at Bruree National School, County Limerick and C.B.S. Charleville, County Cork. Aged sixteen, he won a scholarship. He was not successful in enrolling at two colleges in Limerick, but was accepted at Blackrock College, Dublin, at the instigation of his local curate. Blackrock College has since named one of their six student houses after him. 

He played rugby at Blackrock and Rockwell College, then for Munster around 1905. He remained a lifelong devotee of rugby, attending international matches even towards the end of his life when he was nearly blind.

At the end of his first year at Blackrock College, he was student of the year. He also won further scholarships and exhibitions and in 1903 was appointed teacher of mathematics at Rockwell College, County Tipperary. It was here that de Valera was first given the nickname &quot;Dev&quot; by a teaching colleague, Tom O&#x27;Donnell. In 1904, he graduated in mathematics from the Royal University of Ireland. He then studied for a year at Trinity College Dublin but, owing to the necessity of earning a living, did not proceed further and returned to teaching, this time at Belvedere College. In 1906, he secured a post as a teacher of mathematics at Carysfort Teachers&#x27; Training College for women in Blackrock, Dublin. His applications for professorships in colleges of the National University of Ireland were unsuccessful, but he obtained a part-time appointment at St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth and also taught mathematics at various Dublin schools, including Castleknock College (1910–1911; under the name Edward de Valera) and Belvedere College.

There were occasions when de Valera seriously contemplated the religious life like his half-brother, Fr. Thomas Wheelwright, but ultimately he did not pursue this vocation. As late as 1906, when he was 24 years old, he approached the President of Clonliffe Seminary in Dublin for advice on his vocation. De Valera was throughout his life portrayed as a deeply religious man, and in death asked to be buried in a religious habit. His biographer, Tim Pat Coogan, speculated that questions surrounding de Valera&#x27;s legitimacy may have been a deciding factor in his not entering religious life. Being illegitimate would have ordinarily been a bar to receiving priestly orders as a secular priest, but not to becoming a priest or religious in some religious orders.

As a young &quot;Gaeilgeoir&quot; (Irish speaker), de Valera became an activist for the Irish language. In 1908, he joined the Árdchraobh of Conradh na Gaeilge (the Gaelic League), where he met Sinéad Flanagan, a teacher by profession and four years his senior. They were married on 8 January 1910 at St Paul&#x27;s Church, Arran Quay, Dublin.

The couple had five sons: Vivion (1910–1982), Éamon (1913–1986), Brian (1915–1936), Rúaidhrí (1916–1978), and Terence (Terry; 1922–2007); and two daughters: Máirín (1912–1984) and Emer (1918–2012). Brian de Valera predeceased his parents.

===Early political activity===

While he was already involved in the Gaelic revival, de Valera&#x27;s involvement in the political revolution began on 25 November 1913, when he joined the Irish Volunteers. The organisation was formed to oppose the Ulster Volunteers and ensure the enactment of the Irish Parliamentary Party&#x27;s Third Home Rule Act won by its leader John Redmond. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, de Valera rose through the ranks and it was not long before he was elected captain of the Donnybrook branch. Preparations were pushed ahead for an armed revolt, and he was made commandant of the Third Battalion and adjutant of the Dublin Brigade. He took part in the Howth gun-running. He was sworn by Thomas MacDonagh into the oath-bound Irish Republican Brotherhood, which secretly controlled the central executive of the Volunteers. He opposed secret societies, but this was the only way he could be guaranteed full information on plans for the Rising.

== Revolutionary years ==
===1916 Easter Rising===

On 24 April 1916, the Easter Rising began. Forces commanded by de Valera occupied Boland&#x27;s Mill on Grand Canal Street in Dublin. His chief task was to cover the southeastern approaches to the city. After a week of fighting, the order came from Pádraig Pearse to surrender. De Valera was court-martialled, convicted, and sentenced to death, but the sentence was immediately commuted to penal servitude for life.

De Valera was among the few republican leaders the British did not execute. It has been argued that his life was saved by four facts. First, he was one of the last to surrender and he was held in a different prison from other leaders, thus his execution was delayed by practicalities. Second, the US Consulate in Dublin made representations before his trial (i.e., was he actually a United States citizen and if so, how would the United States react to the execution of one of its citizens?) while the full legal situation was clarified. The UK was trying to bring the US into the war in Europe at the time, and the Irish American vote was important in US politics. Third, when Lt-Gen Sir John Maxwell reviewed his case he said, &quot;Who is he? I haven&#x27;t heard of him before. I wonder would he be likely to make trouble in the future?&quot; On being told that de Valera was unimportant, he commuted the court-martial&#x27;s death sentence to life imprisonment. De Valera had no Fenian family or personal background and his MI5 file in 1916 was very slim, detailing only his open membership in the Irish Volunteers. Fourth, by the time de Valera was court-martialled on 8 May, political pressure was being brought to bear on Maxwell to halt the executions; Maxwell had already told British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith that only two more were to be executed, Seán Mac Diarmada and James Connolly, although they were court-martialled the day after de Valera. His late trial, representations made by the American Consulate, his lack of Fenian background and political pressure all combined to save his life, though had he been tried a week earlier he would probably have been shot.

De Valera&#x27;s supporters and detractors argue about his bravery during the Easter Rising. His supporters claim he showed leadership skills and a capacity for meticulous planning. His detractors claim he suffered a nervous breakdown during the Rising. According to accounts from 1916, de Valera was seen running about, giving conflicting orders, refusing to sleep and on one occasion, having forgotten the password, almost getting himself shot in the dark by his own men. According to one account, de Valera, on being forced to sleep by one subordinate who promised to sit beside him and wake him if he was needed, suddenly woke up, his eyes &quot;wild&quot;, screaming, &quot;Set fire to the railway! Set fire to the railway!&quot; Later in the Ballykinlar internment Camp, one de Valera loyalist approached another internee, a medical doctor, recounted the story, and asked for a medical opinion as to de Valera&#x27;s condition. He also threatened to sue the doctor, future Fine Gael TD and Minister, Dr. Tom O&#x27;Higgins, if he ever repeated the story. The British reportedly, however, considered de Valera&#x27;s forces the best-trained and best-led among the rebels. De Valera&#x27;s latest biographer, Anthony J. Jordan, writes of this controversy, &quot;Whatever happened in Boland&#x27;s Mills, or any other garrison, does not negate or undermine in any way the extraordinary heroism of &quot;Dev&quot; and his comrades&quot;.

After imprisonment in Dartmoor, Maidstone and Lewes prisons, de Valera and his comrades were released under an amnesty in June 1917. On 10 July 1917, he was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for East Clare (the constituency which he represented until 1959) in a by-election caused by the death of the previous incumbent Willie Redmond, brother of the Irish Party leader John Redmond, who had died fighting in World War I. In the 1918 general election he was elected both for that seat and Mayo East. As an abstentionist de Valera would not have gone to Westminster, but was not able to do so regardless because in early 1918 he was again arrested.

Because most other Irish rebellion leaders were dead, in 1917 de Valera had been elected President of Sinn Féin, the party which had been blamed incorrectly for provoking the Easter Rising. This party became the political vehicle through which the survivors of the Easter Rising channelled their republican ethos and objectives. The previous President of Sinn Féin, Arthur Griffith, had championed an Anglo-Irish dual-monarchy based on the Austro-Hungarian model, with independent legislatures for both Ireland and Britain.

===President of Dáil Éireann===
Sinn Féin won a huge majority in the 1918 general election, largely thanks to the British executions of the 1916 leaders, the threat of conscription with the Conscription Crisis of 1918 and the first-past-the-post ballot. They won 73 out of 105 Irish seats, with about 47% of votes cast. 25 seats were uncontested. On 21 January 1919, 27 Sinn Féin MPs (the rest were imprisoned or impaired), calling themselves Teachtaí Dála (TDs), assembled in the Mansion House in Dublin and formed an Irish parliament, known as Dáil Éireann (translatable into English as the &quot;Assembly of Ireland&quot;). The Ministry of Dáil Éireann was formed, under the leadership of the Príomh Aire (also called President of Dáil Éireann) Cathal Brugha. De Valera had been re-arrested in May 1918 and imprisoned and so could not attend the January session of the Dáil. He escaped from Lincoln Gaol, England in February 1919. As a result, he replaced Brugha as Príomh Aire in the April session of Dáil Éireann.

In the hope of securing international recognition, Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly was sent as an envoy to Paris to present the Irish case to the Peace Conference convened by the great powers at the end of World War I. When it became clear by May 1919 that this mission could not succeed, de Valera decided to visit the United States. The mission had three objectives: to ask for official recognition of the Irish Republic, to float a loan to finance the work of the Government (and by extension, the Irish Republican Army), and to secure the support of the American people for the republic. His visit lasted from June 1919 to December 1920 and had mixed success, including a visit to Fenway Park in Boston in front of 50,000 supporters. One negative outcome was the splitting of the Irish-American organisations into pro- and anti-de Valera factions. He met the young Harvard-educated leader from Puerto Rico, Pedro Albizu Campos, and forged a lasting and useful alliance with him. It was during this American tour that he recruited his long-serving personal secretary, Kathleen O&#x27;Connell, an Irish emigrant who would return to Ireland with him. In October 1919, he visited the University of Notre Dame campus in Indiana, where he planted a tree and also laid a wreath by the statue of William Corby. He toured the university archives and spoke in Washington Hall about the cause of Ireland in front of twelve hundred students.De Valera managed to raise $5,500,000 from American supporters, an amount that far exceeded the hopes of the Dáil. Of this, $500,000 was devoted to the American presidential campaign in 1920, helping him gain wider public support there. In 1921, it was said that $1,466,000 had already been spent, and it is unclear when the net balance arrived in Ireland. Recognition was not forthcoming in the international sphere. He also had difficulties with various Irish-American leaders, such as John Devoy and Judge Daniel F. Cohalan, who resented the dominant position he established, preferring to retain their control over Irish affairs in the United States.
While American recognition for the Republic had been his priority, in February 1921, De Valera redirected Patrick McCartan from Washington to Moscow. McCartan was told by Maxim Litvinov, that the opportunity of recognition and assistance had passed. The Soviet priority was a trade agreement with Britain (signed in March). In June the British government (with a view to both domestic and American opinion) published the proposed treaty between the Dáil government and the Soviets, and related correspondence.

Meanwhile, in Ireland, the conflict between the British authorities and the Dáil (which the British declared illegal in September 1919), escalated into the Irish War of Independence. De Valera left day-to-day government, during his eighteen-month absence in the United States, to Michael Collins, his 29-year-old Minister for Finance. De Valera and Collins would later become opponents during the Irish Civil War.

===President of the Republic===
In January 1921, in his first appearance in the Dáil, after his return to a country gripped by the War of Independence, de Valera introduced a motion calling on the IRA to desist from ambushes and other tactics that were allowing the British to successfully portray it as a terrorist group, and to take on the British forces with conventional military methods. This they strongly opposed, and de Valera relented, issuing a statement expressing support for the IRA, and claiming it was fully under the control of the Dáil. He then, along with Cathal Brugha and Austin Stack, brought pressure to bear on Michael Collins to undertake a journey to the United States himself, on the pretext that only he could take up where de Valera had left off. Collins successfully resisted this move and stayed in Ireland. In the May 1921 elections, all candidates in Southern Ireland were returned unopposed, Nationalists and Sinn Féin secured 12 seats in Northern Ireland including leaders such as de Valera, Michael Collins, Eoin MacNeill and Arthur Griffith.
Following the Truce of July 1921 that ended the war, de Valera went to see Prime Minister David Lloyd George in London on 14 July. No agreement was reached, and by then the Parliament of Northern Ireland had already met. It became clear that neither a republic nor independence for all 32 counties, was going to be offered; Lloyd George told de Valera he could &quot;put a soldier in Ireland for every man, woman and child in it&quot; if the IRA did not immediately agree to stop fighting. In August 1921, de Valera secured Dáil Éireann&#x27;s approval to change the 1919 Dáil Constitution to upgrade his office from prime minister or chairman of the cabinet to a full President of the Republic. Declaring himself now the Irish equivalent of King George V, he argued that as Irish head of state, in the absence of the British head of state from the negotiations, he too should not attend the peace conference called the Treaty Negotiations (October–December 1921) at which British and Irish government leaders agreed to the effective independence of twenty-six of Ireland&#x27;s thirty-two counties as the Irish Free State, with Northern Ireland choosing to remain under British sovereignty. It is generally agreed by historians that whatever his motives, it was a mistake for de Valera not to have travelled to London.

Having effected these changes, the Irish Boundary Commission met in 1922-25 to redraw the Irish border. Nationalists expected its report to recommend that largely nationalist areas of Northern Ireland (South Armagh, South Down, Derry City and the Counties Tyrone and Fermanagh) become part of the Free State, and many hoped this would make Northern Ireland so small it would not be economically viable. A Council of Ireland was also provided in the Treaty as a model for an eventual all-Irish parliament. Hence neither the pro- nor anti-Treaty sides made many complaints about partition in the Treaty Debates.

===Anglo-Irish Treaty===
The Republic&#x27;s delegates to the Treaty Negotiations were accredited by de Valera and his cabinet as plenipotentiaries (that is, negotiators with the legal authority to sign a treaty without reference back to the cabinet), but were given secret cabinet instructions by de Valera that required them to return to Dublin before signing the Treaty. The Treaty proved controversial in Ireland insofar as it replaced the Republic by a dominion of the British Commonwealth with the King represented by a Governor-General of the Irish Free State. The Irish delegates Arthur Griffith, Robert Barton and Michael Collins supported by Erskine Childers as Secretary-General set up their delegation headquarters at 22 Hans Place in Knightsbridge. It was there, at 11.15 am on 5 December 1921, that the decision was made to recommend the Treaty to Dáil Éireann. The Treaty was finally signed by the delegates after further negotiations which closed at 02:15 on 6 December 1921.

De Valera baulked at the agreement. His opponents claimed that he had refused to join the negotiations because he knew what the outcome would be and did not wish to receive the blame. De Valera claimed that he had not gone to the treaty negotiations because he would be better able to control the extremists at home, and that his absence would allow leverage for the plenipotentiaries to refer back to him and not be pressured into any agreements. Because of the secret instructions given to the plenipotentiaries, he reacted to news of the signing of the Treaty not with anger at its contents (which he refused even to read when offered a newspaper report of its contents), but with anger over the fact that they had not consulted &quot;him&quot;, their president, before signing. His ideal drafts, presented to a secret session of the Dáil during the Treaty Debates and publicised in January 1922, were ingenious compromises but they included dominion status, the &quot;Treaty Ports&quot;, the fact of partition subject to veto by the parliament in Belfast, and some continuing status for the King as head of the Commonwealth. Ireland&#x27;s share of the imperial debt and the payment of war pensions was to be paid.

After the Treaty was narrowly ratified by 64 to 57, de Valera and a large minority of Sinn Féin TDs left Dáil Éireann. He then resigned and Arthur Griffith was elected President of Dáil Éireann in his place, though respectfully still calling him &#x27;The President&#x27;. On a speaking tour of the more republican province of Munster, starting on 17 March 1922, de Valera made controversial speeches at Carrick on Suir, Lismore, Dungarvan and Waterford, saying that: &quot;&quot;If the Treaty were accepted,&quot; [by the electorate] &quot;the fight for freedom would still go on, and the Irish people, instead of fighting foreign soldiers, will have to fight the Irish soldiers of an Irish government set up by Irishmen.&quot; At Thurles, several days later, he repeated this imagery and added that the IRA: &quot;..would have to wade through the blood of the soldiers of the Irish Government, and perhaps through that of some members of the Irish Government to get their freedom.&quot;&quot; In a letter to the Irish Independent on 23 March de Valera accepted the accuracy of their report of his comment about &quot;wading&quot; through blood, but deplored that the newspaper had published it.

De Valera objected to the oath of allegiance to the King that the treaty required Irish parliamentarians to take. He also was concerned that Ireland could not have an independent foreign policy as part of the British Commonwealth when the British retained several naval ports (see Treaty Ports) around Ireland&#x27;s coast. As a compromise, de Valera proposed &quot;external association&quot; with the British Empire, which would leave Ireland&#x27;s foreign policy in her own hands and a republican constitution with no mention of the British monarch (he proposed this as early as April, well before the negotiations began, under the title &quot;Document No. 2&quot;). Michael Collins was prepared to accept this formula and the two wings (pro- and anti-Treaty) of Sinn Féin formed a pact to fight the 1922 Irish general election together and form a coalition government afterwards. Collins later called off the pact on the eve of the election. De Valera&#x27;s opponents won the election and civil war broke out shortly afterwards in late June 1922.

===Civil War===

Relations between the new Irish government, which was backed by most of the Dáil and the electorate, and the anti-treatyites, under the nominal leadership of de Valera, now descended into the Irish Civil War (June 1922 to May 1923), in which the pro-treaty Free State forces defeated the anti-treaty IRA. Both sides had wanted to avoid civil war, but fighting broke out over the takeover of the Four Courts in Dublin by anti-treaty members of the IRA. These men were not loyal to de Valera and initially were not even supported by the executive of the anti-treaty IRA. However, Michael Collins was forced to act against them when Winston Churchill threatened to re-occupy the country with British troops unless action was taken. When fighting broke out in Dublin between the Four Courts garrison and the new Free State Army, republicans backed the IRA men in the Four Courts, and civil war broke out. De Valera, though he held no military position, backed the anti-treaty IRA, or &quot;irregulars&quot;, and said that he was re-enlisting in the IRA as an ordinary volunteer. On 8 September 1922, he met in secret with Richard Mulcahy in Dublin to try to halt the fighting. However, according to de Valera, they &quot;could not find a basis&quot; for agreement.

Though nominally head of the anti-treatyites, de Valera had little influence. He does not seem to have been involved in any fighting and had little or no influence with the revolutionary military leadership, headed by IRA Chief of Staff Liam Lynch. De Valera and the anti-treaty TDs formed a &quot;republican government&quot; on 25 October 1922 from anti-treaty TDs to &quot;be temporarily the Supreme Executive of the Republic and the State, until such time as the elected Parliament of the Republic can freely assemble, or the people being rid of external aggression are at liberty to decide freely how they are to be governed and what shall be their political relations with other countries&quot; . However, it had no real authority and was a pale shadow of the Dáil government of 1919–21.

In March 1923, de Valera attended the meeting of the IRA Army Executive to decide on the future of the war. He was known to be in favour of a truce but he had no voting rights and it was narrowly decided to continue hostilities. The leader of the Free State, W. T. Cosgrave, insisted that there could be no acceptance of a surrender without disarming.

On 30 April 1923, the IRA&#x27;s new Chief of Staff, Frank Aiken (Lynch had been killed), called a ceasefire. This was followed on 24 May by an order for volunteers to &quot;dump arms&quot;. De Valera, who had wanted an end to the internecine fighting for some time, backed the ceasefire order with a message in which he called the anti-treaty fighters &quot;the Legion of the Rearguard&quot;, saying that &quot;The Republic can no longer be successfully defended by your arms. Further sacrifice on your part would now be in vain and the continuance of the struggle in arms unwise in the national interest and prejudicial to the future of our cause. Military victory must be allowed to rest for the moment with those who have destroyed the republic. Other means must be sought to safeguard the nation&#x27;s right.&quot;

After this point, many of the republicans were arrested in Free State round-ups when they had come out of hiding and returned home. De Valera remained in hiding for several months after the ceasefire was declared; however, he emerged in August to stand for election in County Clare. Referring to the Clare electorate he said: &quot;If the people of Clare elect me as their candidate again, I will be with them and nothing but a bullet will stop me&quot;. Making a campaign appearance in Ennis on 15 August, de Valera was arrested on the platform and interned at Kilmainham jail. He was moved to Arbour Hill barracks briefly prior to his release on 16 July 1924.

==Founding of Fianna Fáil==

After the IRA dumped their arms rather than surrender them or continue a now fruitless war, de Valera returned to political methods. In 1924, he was arrested in Newry for &quot;illegally entering Northern Ireland&quot; and later arrested in Derry. When at trial in Belfast on 1 November 1924 he refused to recognize the court saying that it was: &quot;a creature of a foreign power and therefore had not the sanction of the Irish people&quot;. He was held in solitary confinement for a month in Crumlin Road Gaol, Belfast.

During this time, de Valera came to believe that abstentionism was not a workable tactic in the long term. He now believed that a better course would be to try to gain power and turn the Free State from a constitutional monarchy into a republic. He tried to convince Sinn Féin to accept this new line. However, a vote to accept the Free State Constitution (contingent on the abolition of the Oath of Allegiance) narrowly failed. Soon afterwards, de Valera resigned from Sinn Féin and seriously considered leaving politics.

However, one of his colleagues, Seán Lemass, convinced de Valera to found a new republican party. In March 1926, with Lemass, Constance Markievicz and others, de Valera formed a new party, Fianna Fáil (&quot;The Warriors of Destiny&quot;), a party that was to dominate 20th-century Irish politics. While Sinn Féin still held to an abstentionist line, Fianna Fáil was dedicated to republicanising the Free State from within if it gained power.

Having attracted most of Sinn Féin&#x27;s branches due to Lemass&#x27; organisational skill, the new party made swift electoral gains in the general election on 9 June 1927. In the process, it took much of Sinn Féin&#x27;s previous support, winning 44 seats to Sinn Féin&#x27;s five. It refused to take the Oath of Allegiance (portrayed by opponents as an &#x27;Oath of Allegiance to the Crown&#x27; but actually an &quot;Oath of Allegiance to the Irish Free State&quot; with a secondary &quot;promise of fidelity to the King in his role in the Treaty settlement&quot;).

The oath was largely the work of Collins and based on three sources: British oaths in the dominions, the oath of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and a draft oath prepared by de Valera in his proposed treaty alternative, &quot;Document No. 2&quot;. De Valera began a legal case to challenge the requirement that members of his party take the Oath, but the assassination of the Vice-President of the Executive Council (deputy prime minister) Kevin O&#x27;Higgins on 10 July 1927 led the Executive Council under W. T. Cosgrave to introduce a Bill on 20 July requiring all Dáil candidates to promise on oath that if they were elected they would take the Oath of Allegiance. Forced into a corner, and faced with the option of staying outside politics forever or taking the oath and entering, de Valera and his TDs took the Oath of Allegiance on 12 August 1927, though de Valera himself described the Oath as &quot;an empty political formula&quot;.

De Valera never organised Fianna Fáil in Northern Ireland and it was not until 7 December 2007 that Fianna Fáil was registered there by the UK Electoral Commission.

==President of the Executive Council==

In the 1932 general election Fianna Fáil secured 72 seats and became the largest party in the Dáil, although without a majority. Some Fianna Fáil members arrived at the first sitting of the new Dáil carrying arms, amid fears that Cumann na nGaedheal would not voluntarily surrender power. However, the transition was peaceful. De Valera was elected President of the Executive Council &quot;(Prime Minister)&quot; by the Dáil by a vote of 81–68, with the support of the Labour Party and Independent politicians, and took office on 9 March.

He at once initiated steps to fulfil his election promises to abolish the oath and withhold land annuities owed to the UK for loans provided under the Irish Land Acts and agreed as part of the 1921 Treaty. This launched the Anglo-Irish Trade War when the UK in retaliation imposed economic sanctions against Irish exports. De Valera responded in kind with levies on British imports. The ensuing &quot;Economic War&quot; lasted until 1938.

After De Valera had urged King George V to dismiss McNeill as Governor-General, the King suggested an alternative course of action: that McNeill, instead, carry on a while longer as viceroy and only then resign, which he did on 1 November 1932. Subsequently, a 1916 veteran, Domhnall Ua Buachalla, was appointed Governor-General. To strengthen his position against the opposition in the Dáil and Seanad, de Valera directed the Governor-General to call a snap election in January 1933 and de Valera&#x27;s party won 77 seats, giving Fianna Fáil an overall majority. Under de Valera&#x27;s leadership, Fianna Fáil won further general elections in 1937, 1938, 1943, and 1944.

De Valera took charge of Ireland&#x27;s foreign policy as well by also acting as Minister for External Affairs. In that capacity, he attended meetings of the League of Nations. He was president of the Council of the League on his first appearance at the league in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1932 and, in a speech that made a worldwide impression, appealed for genuine adherence by its members to the principles of the covenant of the league. In 1934, he supported the admission of the Soviet Union into the league. In September 1938, he was elected the nineteenth president of the Assembly of the League, a tribute to the international recognition he had won by his independent stance on world questions.

De Valera&#x27;s government followed the policy of unilaterally dismantling the treaty of 1921. In this way, he would be pursuing republican policies and lessening the popularity of republican violence and the IRA. De Valera encouraged IRA members to join the Irish Defence Forces and the Gardaí. He also refused to dismiss from office those Cumann na nGaedheal, Cosgrave supporters, who had previously opposed him during the Civil War. He did, however, dismiss Eoin O&#x27;Duffy from his position as Garda Commissioner after a year. Eoin O&#x27;Duffy was then invited to be head of the Army Comrades Association (ACA) formed to protect and promote the welfare of its members, previously led by J.F. O&#x27;Higgins, Kevin O&#x27;Higgins&#x27;s brother. This organisation was an obstacle to de Valera&#x27;s power as it supported Cumann na nGaedheal and provided stewards for their meetings. Cumann na nGaedheal meetings were frequently disrupted by Fianna Fáil supporters following the publication of the article: &quot;No Free Speech for Traitors&quot; by Peadar O&#x27;Donnell, an IRA member.

The ACA changed its name to the &quot;National Guard&quot; under O&#x27;Duffy and adopted the uniform of black berets and blue shirts, using the straight-armed salute, and were nicknamed the Blueshirts. They were outwardly fascist and planned a march in August 1933 through Dublin to commemorate Michael Collins, Kevin O&#x27;Higgins, and Arthur Griffith. This march struck parallels with Mussolini&#x27;s march on Rome (1922), in which he had created the image of having toppled the democratic government in Rome. De Valera revived a military tribunal, which had been set up by the previous administration, to deal with the matter. O&#x27;Duffy backed down when the National Guard was declared an illegal organisation and the march was banned. Within a few weeks, O&#x27;Duffy&#x27;s followers merged with Cumann na nGaedhael and the Centre Party to form &quot;United Ireland&quot;, or Fine Gael, and O&#x27;Duffy became its leader. Smaller local marches were scheduled for the following weeks, under different names. Internal dissension set in when the party&#x27;s TDs distanced themselves from O&#x27;Duffy&#x27;s extreme views, and his movement fell asunder.

==Taoiseach (1937–1948)==

Fianna Fáil having won the 1937 election held the same day as the plebiscite that ratified the constitution, de Valera continued as President of the Executive Council until 29 December 1937, when the new constitution was enacted. On that date, de Valera&#x27;s post automatically became that of Taoiseach which was a considerably more powerful office. Notably, he could advise the President to dismiss Ministers individually – advice that the President was bound to follow by convention. The old Executive Council had to be dissolved and reformed if its President wanted to remove a Minister. Additionally, he could request a parliamentary dissolution on his own authority. Previously, the right to seek a dissolution was vested with the Council as a whole.

In social policy, de Valera&#x27;s first period as Taoiseach saw the introduction (in 1947) of means-tested allowances for people suffering from infectious diseases.

===Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement===
With the new constitution in place, de Valera determined that the changed circumstances made swift resolution to Ireland&#x27;s ongoing trade war with the UK more desirable for both sides—as did the growing probability of the outbreak of war across Europe. In April 1938, de Valera and British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain signed the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement, lifting all duties imposed during the previous five years and ending British use of the Treaty Ports it had retained in accordance with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The return of the ports was of particular significance since it ensured Irish neutrality during the coming Second World War.

=== Constitution of Ireland ===
During the 1930s, de Valera systematically stripped the Irish Free State constitution – a constitution originally drafted by a committee under the nominal chairmanship of his rival, Collins – of features tying Ireland to the United Kingdom, limiting its independence and the republican character of its state. De Valera was able to carry out this program of constitutional change by taking advantage of three earlier modifications of constitutional arrangements. First, though the 1922 constitution originally required a public plebiscite for any amendment enacted more than eight years after its passage, the Free State government under W. T. Cosgrave had amended that period to sixteen years. This meant that, until 1938, the Free State constitution could be amended by the simple passage of a &quot;Constitutional Amendment Act&quot; through the Oireachtas. Secondly, while the Governor-General of the Irish Free State could reserve or deny Royal Assent to any legislation, from 1927, the power to advise the Governor-General to do so no longer rested with the British government in London but with His Majesty&#x27;s Government in the Irish Free State, which meant that, in practice, the Royal Assent was automatically granted to legislation; the government was hardly likely to advise the governor-general to block the enactment of one of its own bills. Thirdly, though in its original theory, the constitution &quot;had&quot; to be in keeping with the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Treaty as the fundamental law of the state, that requirement had been abrogated a short time before de Valera gained power.

The Oath of Allegiance was abolished, as were appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The opposition-controlled Senate, when it protested and slowed down these measures, was also abolished. In 1931, the British Parliament passed the Statute of Westminster, which established the legislative equal status of the self-governing Dominions of the then British Commonwealth, including the Irish Free State, to one another and the United Kingdom. Though a few constitutional links between the Dominions and the United Kingdom remained, this is often seen as the moment at which the Dominions became fully sovereign states.

De Valera, in his capacity as Prime Minister of His Majesty&#x27;s Government in the Irish Free State, wrote in July 1936 to King Edward VIII in London indicating that he planned to introduce a new constitution, the central part of which was to be the creation of an office de Valera provisionally intended to call &quot;President of Saorstát Éireann&quot; (), which would replace the Governor-General. De Valera used the sudden abdication of Edward VIII as King to pass two bills: one amended the constitution to remove all mention of the monarch and Governor-General, while the second brought the monarch back, this time through statute law, for use in representing the Irish Free State at a diplomatic level. With the implementation of the Constitution of Ireland (), the title ultimately given to the president was &quot;President of Ireland&quot; ().

The constitution contained reforms and symbols intended to assert Irish sovereignty. These included:
* a new name for the state, &quot;Éire&quot; (in Irish) and &quot;Ireland&quot; (in English);
* a claim that the national territory was the entire island of Ireland, thereby challenging Britain&#x27;s partition settlement of 1921;
* the removal of references to the King of Ireland and the replacement of the monarch&#x27;s representative, the governor-general, with a popularly elected President of Ireland, who takes &quot;precedence over all other persons in the State and who shall exercise and perform the powers and functions conferred on the President by this Constitution and by law&quot;;
* recognition of the &quot;special position&quot; of the Catholic Church;
* a recognition of the Catholic concept of marriage which excluded civil divorce, even though civil marriage was retained;
* the declaration that the Irish language was the &quot;national language&quot; and the first official language of the nation although English was also included as &quot;a&quot; second official language;
* the use of Irish language terms to stress Irish cultural and historical identity (e.g., Uachtarán, Taoiseach, Tánaiste, etc.)

Criticisms of some of the above constitutional reforms include that:
* the anti-partition articles needlessly antagonised Unionists in Northern Ireland, while simultaneously attracting criticism from hardline republicans by recognising the situation.
* similarly, the recognition of the &quot;special position&quot; of the Catholic Church was inconsistent with the identity and aspirations of northern Protestants (leading to its repeal in the 1970s), while simultaneously falling short of the demands of hardline Catholics for Catholicism to be explicitly made the state religion.
* the affirmation of Irish as the national and primary official language neither reflected contemporary realities nor led to the language&#x27;s revival
* though the King was removed from the text of the constitution, he retained a leading role in the state&#x27;s foreign affairs, and the legal position of the President of Ireland was accordingly uncertain; there was also concern that the presidency would evolve into a dictatorial position
* elements of Catholic social teaching incorporated into the text, such as the articles on the role of women, the family and divorce, were inconsistent both with the practice of the Protestant minority and with contemporary liberal opinion

As Paul Bew concludes, in the constitution of 1937 de Valera was &quot;trying to placate left-wing Republicans with national phrases and pious people with expressly Catholic bits [and] patriarchal Catholicism&quot;.

The Constitution was approved in a plebiscite on 1 July 1937 and came into force on 29 December 1937.

===The Emergency (World War II)===

By September 1939, a general European war was imminent. On 2 September, de Valera advised Dáil Éireann that neutrality was the best policy for the country. This policy had overwhelming political and popular support, though some advocated Irish participation in the war on the Allied side, while others, believing that &quot;England&#x27;s difficulty is Ireland&#x27;s opportunity&quot;, were pro-German. Strong objections to conscription in the North were voiced by de Valera. In June 1940, to encourage the neutral Irish state to join with the Allies, Winston Churchill indicated to de Valera that the United Kingdom would push for Irish unity, but believing that Churchill could not deliver, de Valera declined the offer. The day after the attacks on Pearl Harbor Churchill wired de Valera: &quot;Now is your chance. Now or never! A nation once again. I will meet you wherever you wish.&quot; The British did not inform the Government of Northern Ireland that they had made the offer to the Irish government, and De Valera&#x27;s rejection was not publicised until 1970. 

The government secured wide powers for the duration of the Emergency, such as internment, censorship of the press and correspondence, and government control of the economy. The &quot;Emergency Powers Act&quot; lapsed on 2 September 1946, though the State of Emergency declared under the constitution was not lifted until the 1970s. This status remained throughout the war, despite pressure from Chamberlain and Churchill. However, de Valera did respond to a request from Northern Ireland for fire tenders to assist in fighting fires following the 1941 Belfast Blitz. His 1943 St Patrick&#x27;s Day radio address, now widely derided, showcased his traditionalist views, extolling an Ireland &quot;satisfied with frugal comfort&quot;, populated by &quot;sturdy children&quot; and &quot;happy maidens&quot;.

Controversially, de Valera visited and offered condolences to the German ambassador in Dublin on the death of Adolf Hitler in 1945, in accordance with diplomatic protocol of neutral nations. This did some damage to Ireland&#x27;s international reputation, particularly in the United States – and soon afterwards de Valera had a bitter exchange of words with Churchill in two famous radio addresses after the end of the war in Europe. De Valera denounced reports of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp as &quot;anti-national propaganda&quot;; according to Bew, this was not out of disbelief but rather because the Holocaust undermined the main assumption underlying Irish neutrality: moral equivalence between the Allies and the Axis.

The de Valera government was reputedly harsh with Irish Army deserters who had enlisted to fight with the Allied armies against the Axis. The legislation in question was the Emergency Powers (No. 362) order which was passed in August 1945. On 18 October 1945, Thomas F. O&#x27;Higgins moved to annul the order. He did not condone desertion, but felt that the order was specifically harsh on those deserters who had served in the Allied forces. General Richard Mulcahy also spoke against the Order, disagreeing with the way in which it applied to enlisted men and not to officers. It was revoked with effect from 1 August 1946, but was in effect continued by section 13 of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946.

==Post-war period: Taoiseach/Opposition leader==
===Opposition leader (1948–1951)===
After de Valera had spent sixteen years in power without answering the crucial questions of partition and republican status the public demanded a change from the Fianna Fáil government. In the 1948 election, de Valera lost the outright majority he had enjoyed since 1933. It initially looked as if the National Labour Party would give Fianna Fáil enough support to stay in office as a minority government, but National Labour insisted on a formal coalition agreement, something de Valera was unwilling to concede. However, while Fianna Fáil was six seats short of a majority, it was still by far the largest party in the Dáil, with 37 more TDs than the next largest party and rival, Fine Gael (the successor to Cumann na nGaedheal). Conventional wisdom held that de Valera would remain Taoiseach with the support of independent deputies.

This belief came to nought when (after the final votes were counted) the other parties realised that if they banded together, they would have only one seat fewer than Fianna Fáil, and would be able to form a government with the support of at least seven independents. The result was the First Inter-Party Government, with John A. Costello of Fine Gael as its compromise candidate for Taoiseach. Costello was duly nominated, consigning de Valera to opposition for the first time in 16 years. The following year, Costello declared Ireland as a republic, leaving partition as the most pressing political issue of the day.

De Valera, now Leader of the Opposition, left the actual parliamentary practice of opposing the government to his deputy, Seán Lemass, and himself embarked on a world campaign to address the issue of partition. He visited the United States, Australia, New Zealand and India, and in the latter country, was the last guest of the Governor-General, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, before he was succeeded by the first Indian-born Governor-General. In Melbourne, Australia, de Valera was feted by the powerful Catholic Archbishop Daniel Mannix, at the centenary celebrations of the diocese of Melbourne. He attended mass meetings at Xavier College, and addressed the assembled Melbourne Celtic Club. In Brisbane, Australia, at the request of the influential and long-serving Archbishop Duhig, de Valera laid the foundation stone for the new High School building at Marist Brothers College Rosalie. In October 1950, just thirty years after his dramatic escape from Lincoln Gaol, he returned to Lincoln and received the freedom of the gaol. The Anti-Partition of Ireland League of Great Britain marked the occasion with a dinner in his honour and the toast was &#x27;Anglo-Irish Friendship&#x27;. A key message in de Valera&#x27;s campaign was that Ireland could not join the recently established North Atlantic Treaty Organization as long as Northern Ireland was in British hands; although Costello&#x27;s government favoured alliance with NATO, de Valera&#x27;s approach won more widespread support and prevented the state from signing the treaty.

===Final years as Taoiseach===

Returning to Ireland during the Mother and Child Scheme crisis that racked the First Inter-Party Government, de Valera kept silent as Leader of the Opposition, preferring to stay aloof from the controversy. That stance helped return de Valera to power in the 1951 general election, but without an overall majority. His and Fianna Fáil&#x27;s popularity was short-lived, however; his government introduced severe, deflationary budgetary and economic policies in 1952, causing a political backlash that cost Fianna Fáil several seats in the Dáil in by-elections of 1953 and early 1954. Faced with a likely loss of confidence in the Dáil, de Valera instead called an election in May 1954, in which Fianna Fáil was defeated and a Second Inter-Party Government was formed with John A. Costello again as Taoiseach.

On 16 September 1953, de Valera met British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for the first and only time, at 10 Downing Street. (The two men had seen each other at a party in 1949, but without speaking). He surprised the UK Prime Minister by claiming that if he had been in office in 1948 Ireland would not have left the Commonwealth.

It was during this period that de Valera&#x27;s eyesight began to deteriorate and he was forced to spend several months in the Netherlands, where he had six operations. In 1955, while in opposition, de Valera spoke against the formation of a European Parliament and European federalism, noting that Ireland &quot;did not strive to get out of that British domination [...] to get into a worse [position]&quot;.

Like the first coalition government, the second lasted only three years. At the general election of 1957, de Valera, then in his seventy-fifth year, won an absolute majority of nine seats, the greatest number he had ever secured. This was the beginning of another sixteen-year period in office for Fianna Fáil. A new economic policy emerged with the First Programme for Economic Expansion. In July 1957, in response to the Border Campaign (IRA), Part II of the Offences Against the State Act was re-activated and he ordered the internment without trial of Republican suspects, an action which did much to end the IRA&#x27;s campaign.

De Valera&#x27;s final term as Taoiseach also saw the passage of numerous reforms in health and welfare. In 1952, unemployment insurance was extended to male agricultural employees, child allowances were extended to the second child, and a maternity allowance for insured women was introduced. A year later, eligibility for maternity and child services and public hospital services was extended to approximately 85% of the population.

==Presidency==

While Fianna Fáil remained popular among the electorate, 75-year-old de Valera had begun to be seen by the electorate as too old and out of touch to remain as head of government. At the urging of party officials, de Valera decided to retire from government and the Dáil and instead seek the presidency of Ireland. He won the 1959 presidential election on 17 June 1959 and resigned as Taoiseach, Leader of Fianna Fáil and a TD for Clare, six days later, handing over power to Seán Lemass.

De Valera was inaugurated as President of Ireland on 25 June 1959. He was re-elected President in 1966 aged 84, which until 2013 was a world record for the oldest elected head of state. At his retirement in 1973 at the age of 90, he was the oldest head of state in the world.

As President of Ireland, de Valera received many state visits, including the 1963 visit of the US president John F. Kennedy. Five months later de Valera attended the state funeral for Kennedy in Washington, D.C., and accompanied a group of 24 Defence Forces cadets who performed a silent drill at his gravesite. In June 1964, he returned to Washington, D.C., as the second President of Ireland to address the United States Congress.

In 1966, the Dublin Jewish community arranged the planting and dedication of the Éamon de Valera Forest in Israel, near Nazareth, in recognition of his support for Ireland&#x27;s Jews.

In January 1969, de Valera became the first President to address both houses of the Oireachtas, to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of Dáil Éireann.

In 1969, seventy-three countries sent goodwill messages to NASA for the historic first lunar landing. These messages still rest on the lunar surface. De Valera&#x27;s message on behalf of Ireland stated, &quot;May God grant that the skill and courage which have enabled man to alight upon the Moon will enable him, also, to secure peace and happiness upon the Earth and avoid the danger of self-destruction.&quot;

==Death==

Éamon de Valera died from pneumonia and heart failure in Linden Convalescent Home, Blackrock, Dublin, on 29 August 1975, aged 92. His wife, Sinéad de Valera, four years his senior, had died the previous January, on the eve of their 65th wedding anniversary. His body lay in state at Dublin Castle and was given a full state funeral on 3 September at St Mary&#x27;s Pro-Cathedral, which was broadcast on national television. Over 200,000 people reportedly lined the three-mile funeral route from Dublin city centre to Glasnevin Cemetery. He is buried in Glasnevin alongside his wife and son Brian.

==Legacy==

De Valera&#x27;s political creed evolved from militant republicanism to social and cultural conservatism.

Ireland&#x27;s dominant political personality for many decades, de Valera received numerous honours. He was elected Chancellor of the National University of Ireland in 1921, holding the post until his death. Pope John XXIII bestowed on him the Order of Christ (KSC). He received honorary degrees from universities in Ireland and abroad. In 1968, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), a recognition of his lifelong interest in mathematics. He also served as a member of the Parliament of Northern Ireland (for Down from 1921 to 1929 and for South Down from 1933 to 1937), although he held to the republican policy of abstentionism and did not take his seat in Stormont.

De Valera was criticised for becoming co-owner of one of Ireland&#x27;s most influential group of newspapers, Irish Press Newspapers, funded by numerous small investors who received no dividend for decades. De Valera is alleged by critics to have helped keep Ireland under the influence of Catholic conservatism. De Valera rejected, however, demands by organisations like Maria Duce that Roman Catholicism be made the state religion of Ireland, just as he rejected demands by the Irish Christian Front for the Irish Free State to support Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War.

De Valera&#x27;s preoccupation with his part in history, and his need to explain and justify it, are reflected in innumerable ways. His faith in historians as trustworthy guardians of his reputation was not absolute. He made many attempts to influence their views and to adjust and refine the historical record whenever he felt this portrayed him, his allies or his cause inaccurately or unfavourably to his mind, these could often mean the same thing. He extended these endeavours to encompass the larger Irish public. An important function of his newspaper group, the Irish Press group, was to rectify what he saw as the errors and omissions of a decade in which he had been the subject of largely hostile commentary.

In recent decades, his role in Irish history has no longer been unequivocally seen by historians as a positive one, and a biography by Tim Pat Coogan alleges that his failures outweigh his achievements, with de Valera&#x27;s reputation declining while that of his great rival in the 1920s, Michael Collins, was rising. A more recent 2007 work on de Valera by historian Diarmaid Ferriter presents a more positive picture of de Valera&#x27;s legacy.
Bertie Ahern, at a book launch for Diarmaid Ferriter&#x27;s biography of de Valera, described de Valera&#x27;s achievements in political leadership during the formative years of the state:
One of de Valera&#x27;s finest hours was his regrouping of the Republican side after defeat in the civil war, and setting his followers on an exclusively peaceful and democratic path, along which he later had to confront both domestic Fascism and the IRA. He became a democratic statesman, not a dictator. He did not purge the civil service of those who had served his predecessors but made the best use of the talent available.

A notable failure was his attempt to reverse the provision of the 1937 Constitution in relation to the electoral system. On retiring as Taoiseach in 1959, he proposed that the Proportional Representation system enshrined in that constitution should be replaced. De Valera argued that Proportional Representation had been responsible for the instability that had characterised much of the post-war period. A constitutional referendum to ratify this was defeated by the people.

One aspect of de Valera&#x27;s legacy is that since the foundation of the state, a de Valera has nearly always served in Dáil Éireann. Éamon de Valera served until 1959, and his son, Vivion de Valera, was a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1945 to 1981. Éamon Ó Cuív, his grandson, served as a member of the Dáil from 1992 to 2024 (previously having served in the Seanad from 1989 to 1992) with one stint as deputy leader of Fianna Fáil, while his granddaughter, Síle de Valera, is also former TD, with both having served in ministries in the Irish Government.

===Catholic social policy===

In 1931, de Valera said in the Dáil: &quot;I believe that every citizen in this country is entitled to his share of public appointments, and that there should not be discrimination on the ground of religion, discrimination, mind you, in the sense that because a person was of a particular religion, religion should not be made an excuse for denying a person an appointment for which he or she was fully qualified. Then there comes the question, what are qualifications? If I thought that the principle that the librarian in a Catholic community should be Catholic was a new principle, introduced merely to deny a Protestant an appointment, I would vote against it, but I know from my youth that it is not so. ... if I had a vote on a local body, and if there were two qualified people who had to deal with a Catholic community, and if one was a Catholic and the other a Protestant, I would unhesitatingly vote for the Catholic. Let us be clear and let us know where we are.&quot; Ryle Dwyer, writing in 2008, said &quot;If those were his honest views, one could also say without hesitation that the Long Fellow was a bigot. But, in fact, he was just playing the role of a political hypocrite. It was cynical, but it should be stressed that he behaved responsibly in this regard when he came to power.&quot;

De Valera led Fianna Fáil to adopt conservative social policies since he believed devoutly that the Catholic church and the family were central to Irish identity. He added clauses to the new Constitution of Ireland (1937) to &quot;guard with special care the institution of marriage&quot; and prohibit divorce. His constitution also recognised &quot;the special position&quot; of the Catholic Church and recognised other denominations including the Church of Ireland and Jewish congregations, while guaranteeing the religious freedom of all citizens; however, he resisted an attempt to make Roman Catholicism the state religion and his constitution forbids the establishment of a state religion. His policies were welcomed by a largely devout, conservative and rural electorate. The unenforceable articles in the constitution which reinforced the traditional view that a woman&#x27;s place was in the home further illustrate the direction in which Ireland was moving. An act of 1935 prohibited the importation or sale of contraceptives. The most rigorous censorship laws in Western Europe complete the picture.

The specific recognition of Roman Catholicism was deleted by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (1973) and the prohibition of divorce was removed by the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (1996). Nevertheless, the Irish Supreme Court declared in 1973 that the 1935 contraception legislation was not repugnant to the Constitution and therefore remained valid. Subsequent laws have liberalised the use of contraception however, (see Contraception in the Republic of Ireland).

<text>Mount Everest, known locally as Sagarmatha or Qomolangma, is Earth&#x27;s highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point. Its elevation (snow height) of was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.

Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the standard route) and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall. As of May 2024, 340 people have died on Everest. Over 200 bodies remain on the mountain and have not been removed due to the dangerous conditions.

Climbers typically ascend only part of Mount Everest&#x27;s elevation, as the mountain&#x27;s full elevation is measured from the geoid, which approximates sea level. The closest sea to Mount Everest&#x27;s summit is the Bay of Bengal, almost away. To approximate a climb of the entire height of Mount Everest, one would need to start from this coastline, a feat accomplished by Tim Macartney-Snape&#x27;s team in 1990.
Climbers usually begin their ascent from base camps above . The amount of elevation climbed from below these camps varies. On the Tibetan side, most climbers drive directly to the North Base Camp. On the Nepalese side, climbers generally fly into Kathmandu, then Lukla, and trek to the South Base Camp, making the climb from Lukla to the summit about in elevation gain.

The first recorded efforts to reach Everest&#x27;s summit were made by British mountaineers. As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time, the British made several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side. After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached on the North Col, the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to , marking the first time a human had climbed above . The 1924 expedition resulted in one of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day: George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate as to whether they were the first to reach the top. Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary made the first documented ascent of Everest in 1953, using the southeast ridge route. Norgay had reached the previous year as a member of the 1952 Swiss expedition. The Chinese mountaineering team of Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo, and Qu Yinhua made the first reported ascent of the peak from the north ridge on 25 May 1960.
==Name==
Mount Everest&#x27;s Nepali/Sanskrit name is &quot;Sagarmāthā&quot; (IAST transcription) or &quot;Sagar-Matha&quot; (सगर-माथा, , &quot;goddess of the sky&quot;), which means &quot;the head in the great blue sky&quot;, being derived from सगर (sagar), meaning &quot;sky&quot;, and माथा (māthā), meaning &quot;head&quot;.

The Tibetan name for Everest is &quot;Qomolangma&quot; (,  &quot;holy mother&quot;). The name was first recorded (in a Chinese transcription) in the 1721 Kangxi Atlas, issued during the reign of Qing Emperor Kangxi; it first appeared in the West in 1733 as &quot;Tchoumour Lancma&quot;, on a map prepared by the French geographer D&#x27;Anville and based on Kangxi Atlas. The Tibetan name is also popularly romanised as &quot;Chomolungma&quot; and (in Wylie) as &quot;Jo-mo-glang-ma&quot;.

The official Chinese transcription is or &quot;Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng&quot; in pinyin. While other Chinese names have been used historically, including &quot;Shèngmǔ Fēng&quot;  &quot;holy mother peak&quot;), these names were largely phased out after the Chinese Ministry of Internal Affairs issued a decree to adopt a sole name in May 1952. 
The British geographic survey of 1849 attempted to preserve local names when possible (e.g., Kangchenjunga and Dhaulagiri.) However, Andrew Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India, claimed that he could not find a commonly used local name, and that his search for one had been hampered by the Nepalese and Tibetan policy of exclusion of foreigners. Waugh argued that – because there were many local names – it would be difficult to favour one name over all others; he therefore decided that Peak XV should be named after British surveyor Sir George Everest, his predecessor as Surveyor General of India. Everest himself opposed the honor, and told the Royal Geographical Society in 1857 that &quot;Everest&quot; could neither be written in Hindi nor pronounced by &quot;the native of India&quot;. Despite Everest&#x27;s objections, Waugh&#x27;s proposed name prevailed, and the Royal Geographical Society officially adopted the name &quot;Mount Everest&quot; in 1865. The modern pronunciation of Everest () is different from Sir George&#x27;s pronunciation of his surname ( ).

In the late 19th century, many European cartographers incorrectly believed that a native name for the mountain was Gaurishankar, a mountain between Kathmandu and Everest.

===Other names===
* &quot;Peak XV&quot; (temporary, assigned by British Imperial Survey)
* &quot;Deodungha&quot; (Old Darjeeling)
* &quot;Gauri Shankar&quot;, &quot;Gaurishankar&quot;, or &quot;Gaurisankar&quot; (misattribution; used occasionally until about 1900. In modern times the name is used for a different peak about away.)

==Surveys==
===19th century===

In 1802, the British began the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India to fix the locations, heights, and names of the world&#x27;s highest mountains. Starting in southern India, the survey teams moved northward using giant theodolites, each weighing and requiring 12 men to carry, to measure heights as accurately as possible. They reached the Himalayan foothills by the 1830s, but Nepal was unwilling to allow the British to enter the country due to suspicions of their intentions. Several requests by the surveyors to enter Nepal were denied.

The British were forced to continue their observations from Terai, a region south of Nepal which is parallel to the Himalayas. Conditions in Terai were difficult because of torrential rains and malaria. Three survey officers died from malaria while two others had to retire because of failing health.

Nonetheless, in 1847, the British continued the survey and began detailed observations of the Himalayan peaks from observation stations up to distant. Weather restricted work to the last three months of the year. In November 1847, Andrew Scott Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India, made several observations from the Sawajpore station at the east end of the Himalayas. Kangchenjunga was then considered the highest peak in the world, and with interest, he noted a peak beyond it, about away. John Armstrong, one of Waugh&#x27;s subordinates, also saw the peak from a site farther west and called it peak &quot;b&quot;. Waugh would later write that the observations indicated that peak &quot;b&quot; was higher than Kangchenjunga, but closer observations were required for verification. The following year, Waugh sent a survey official back to Terai to make closer observations of peak &quot;b&quot;, but clouds thwarted his attempts.

In 1849, Waugh dispatched James Nicolson to the area, who made two observations from Jirol, away. Nicolson then took the largest theodolite and headed east, obtaining over 30 observations from five different locations, with the closest being from the peak.

Nicolson retreated to Patna on the Ganges to perform the necessary calculations based on his observations. His raw data gave an average height of for peak &quot;b&quot;, but this did not consider light refraction, which distorts heights. However, the number clearly indicated that peak &quot;b&quot; was higher than Kangchenjunga. Nicolson contracted malaria and was forced to return home without finishing his calculations. Michael Hennessy, one of Waugh&#x27;s assistants, had begun designating peaks based on Roman numerals, with Kangchenjunga named Peak IX. Peak &quot;b&quot; now became known as Peak XV.

In 1852, stationed at the survey headquarters in Dehradun, Radhanath Sikdar, an Indian mathematician and surveyor from Bengal was the first to identify Everest as the world&#x27;s highest peak, using trigonometric calculations based on Nicolson&#x27;s measurements. An official announcement that Peak XV was the highest was delayed for several years as the calculations were repeatedly verified. Waugh began work on Nicolson&#x27;s data in 1854, and along with his staff spent almost two years working on the numbers, having to deal with the problems of light refraction, barometric pressure, and temperature over the vast distances of the observations. Finally, in March 1856 he announced his findings in a letter to his deputy in Calcutta. Kangchenjunga was declared to be , while Peak XV was given the height of . Waugh concluded that Peak XV was &quot;most probably the highest in the world&quot;. Peak XV (measured in feet) was calculated to be exactly high, but was publicly declared to be in order to avoid the impression that an exact height of was nothing more than a rounded estimate. Waugh is sometimes playfully credited with being &quot;the first person to put two feet on top of Mount Everest&quot;.

===20th century===


In 1856, Andrew Waugh announced Everest (then known as Peak XV) as high, after several years of calculations based on observations made by the Great Trigonometrical Survey. 
From 1952 to 1954, the Survey of India, using triangulation methods, determined that the height of Everest was . In 1975 it was subsequently reaffirmed by a Chinese measurement of . In both cases the snow cap, not the rock head, was measured.
The height given was officially recognised by Nepal and China. Nepal planned a new survey in 2019 to determine if the April 2015 Nepal earthquake affected the height of the mountain.

In May 1999, an American Everest expedition directed by Bradford Washburn anchored a GPS unit into the highest bedrock. A rock head elevation of , and a snow/ice elevation higher, were obtained via this device. Although as of 2001, it has not been officially recognised by Nepal, this figure is widely quoted. Geoid uncertainty casts doubt upon the accuracy claimed by both the 1999 and 2005 (see § 21st-century surveys) surveys.

In 1955, a detailed photogrammetric map (at a scale of 1:50,000) of the Khumbu region, including the south side of Mount Everest, was made by Erwin Schneider as part of the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, which also attempted Lhotse.

In the late 1980s, an even more detailed topographic map of the Everest area was made under the direction of Bradford Washburn, using extensive aerial photography.

===21st century===
On 9 October 2005, after several months of measurement and calculation, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping announced the height of Everest as with accuracy of ±, claiming it was the most accurate and precise measurement to date. This height is based on the highest point of rock and not the snow and ice covering it. The Chinese team measured a snow-ice depth of , which is in agreement with a net elevation of . An argument arose between China and Nepal as to whether the official height should be the rock height (8,844 m, China) or the snow height (8,848 m, Nepal). In 2010, both sides agreed that the height of Everest is 8,848 m, and Nepal recognises China&#x27;s claim that the rock height of Everest is 8,844 m. On 8 December 2020, it was jointly announced by the two countries that the new official height is .

It is thought that the plate tectonics of the Main Himalayan Thrust and related faults, which form the convergent boundary between the Eurasian Plate and Indian Plate, are adding to the height and moving the summit northeastwards. Two accounts suggest the rates of change are per year vertically and per year horizontally, but another account mentions more lateral movement (), and even shrinkage has been suggested.

=== Comparisons ===
The summit of Everest is the point at which Earth&#x27;s surface reaches the greatest distance above sea level. Several other mountains are sometimes claimed to be the &quot;tallest mountains on Earth&quot;. Mauna Kea in Hawaii is tallest when measured from its base; it rises over from its base on the mid-ocean floor, but only attains above sea level.

By the same measure of base to summit, Denali, in Alaska, federally designated as Mount McKinley, is taller than Everest as well. Despite its height above sea level of only , Denali sits atop a sloping plain with elevations from , yielding a height above base in the range of ; a commonly quoted figure is . By comparison, reasonable base elevations for Everest range from on the south side to on the Tibetan Plateau, yielding a height above base in the range of .

The summit of Chimborazo in Ecuador is farther from Earth&#x27;s centre () than that of Everest (), because the Earth bulges at the equator. This is despite Chimborazo having a peak of above sea level versus Mount Everest&#x27;s .

===Context and maps===
Nearby peaks include Lhotse, ; Nuptse, , and Changtse, among others. Another nearby peak is Khumbutse, and many of the highest mountains in the world are near Mount Everest. On the southwest side, a major feature in the lower areas is the Khumbu icefall and glacier, an obstacle to climbers on those routes but also to the base camps.

==Geology==

Geologists have subdivided the rocks comprising Mount Everest into three units called formations. Each formation is separated from the other by low-angle faults, called detachments, along which they have been thrust southward over each other. From the summit of Mount Everest to its base these rock units are the Qomolangma Formation, the North Col Formation, and the Rongbuk Formation.

The Qomolangma Formation, also known as the Jolmo Lungama Formation, runs from the summit to the top of the Yellow Band, about above sea level. It consists of greyish to dark grey or white, parallel laminated and bedded, Ordovician limestone interlayered with subordinate beds of recrystallised dolomite with argillaceous laminae and siltstone. Gansser first reported finding microscopic fragments of crinoids in this limestone. Later petrographic analysis of samples of the limestone from near the summit revealed them to be composed of carbonate pellets and finely fragmented remains of trilobites, crinoids, and ostracods. Other samples were so badly sheared and recrystallised that their original constituents could not be determined. A thick, white-weathering thrombolite bed that is thick comprises the foot of the &quot;Third Step&quot;, and base of the summit pyramid of Everest. This bed, which crops out starting about below the summit of Mount Everest, consists of sediments trapped, bound, and cemented by the biofilms of micro-organisms, especially cyanobacteria, in shallow marine waters. The Qomolangma Formation is broken up by several high-angle faults that terminate at the low angle normal fault, the Qomolangma Detachment. This detachment separates it from the underlying Yellow Band. The lower five metres of the Qomolangma Formation overlying this detachment are very highly deformed.

The bulk of Mount Everest, between , consists of the North Col Formation, of which the Yellow Band forms the upper part between . The Yellow Band consists of intercalated beds of Middle Cambrian diopside-epidote-bearing marble, which weathers a distinctive yellowish brown, and muscovite-biotite phyllite and semischist. Petrographic analysis of marble collected from about found it to consist as much as five per cent of the ghosts of recrystallised crinoid ossicles. The upper five metres of the Yellow Band lying adjacent to the Qomolangma Detachment is badly deformed. A thick fault breccia separates it from the overlying Qomolangma Formation.

The remainder of the North Col Formation, exposed between on Mount Everest, consists of interlayered and deformed schist, phyllite, and minor marble. Between , the North Col Formation consists chiefly of biotite-quartz phyllite and chlorite-biotite phyllite intercalated with minor amounts of biotite-sericite-quartz schist. Between , the lower part of the North Col Formation consists of biotite-quartz schist intercalated with epidote-quartz schist, biotite-calcite-quartz schist, and thin layers of quartzose marble. These metamorphic rocks appear to be the result of the metamorphism of Middle to Early Cambrian deep sea flysch composed of interbedded, mudstone, shale, clayey sandstone, calcareous sandstone, graywacke, and sandy limestone. The base of the North Col Formation is a regional low-angle normal fault called the &quot;Lhotse detachment&quot;.

Below 7,000 m (23,000 ft), the Rongbuk Formation underlies the North Col Formation and forms the base of Mount Everest. It consists of sillimanite-K-feldspar grade schist and gneiss intruded by numerous sills and dikes of leucogranite ranging in thickness from 1 cm to 1,500 m (0.4 in to 4,900 ft). These leucogranites are part of a belt of Late Oligocene–Miocene intrusive rocks known as the Higher Himalayan leucogranite. They formed as the result of partial melting of Paleoproterozoic to Ordovician high-grade metasedimentary rocks of the Higher Himalayan Sequence about 20 to 24 million years ago during the subduction of the Indian Plate.

Mount Everest consists of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks that have been faulted southward over continental crust composed of Archean granulites of the Indian Plate during the Cenozoic collision of India with Asia. Current interpretations argue that the Qomolangma and North Col formations consist of marine sediments that accumulated within the continental shelf of the northern passive continental margin of India before it collided with Asia. The Cenozoic collision of India with Asia subsequently deformed and metamorphosed these strata as it thrust them southward and upward. The Rongbuk Formation consists of a sequence of high-grade metamorphic and granitic rocks that were derived from the alteration of high-grade metasedimentary rocks. During the collision of India with Asia, these rocks were thrust downward and to the north as they were overridden by other strata; heated, metamorphosed, and partially melted at depths of over below sea level; and then forced upward to surface by thrusting towards the south between two major detachments. Mount Everest is rising by about 2 mm per year.

===IUGS geological heritage site===
In respect of the recognition of the &quot;highest rocks on the planet&quot; as fossiliferous, marine limestone, the Ordovician Rocks of Mount Everest were included by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) in its assemblage of 100 geological heritage sites around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as &quot;a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.&quot;

==Flora and fauna==

There is very little native flora or fauna on Everest. A type of moss grows at on Mount Everest and it may be the highest altitude plant species. An alpine cushion plant called &quot;Arenaria&quot; is known to grow below in the region. According to the study based on satellite data from 1993 to 2018, vegetation is expanding in the Everest region. Researchers have found plants in areas that were previously deemed bare.

A minute black jumping spider of the genus &quot;Euophrys&quot; has been found at elevations as high as , possibly making it the highest confirmed non-microscopic permanent resident on Earth. Another Euophrys species, &quot;E. everestensis&quot;, has been found at , and may feed on insects that have been blown there by the wind. There is a high likelihood of microscopic life at even higher altitudes.

The bar-headed goose migrates over the Himalayas and have been seen flying at the higher altitudes of the mountain. In 1953, George Lowe (part of the expedition of Tenzing and Hillary) said that he saw bar-headed geese flying over Everest&#x27;s summit. Another bird species, the chough, have been spotted as high as the South Col at and yellow-billed choughs have been seen as high as .

Yaks are often used to haul gear for Mount Everest climbs. They can haul around 100 kg (220 pounds), have thick fur and large lungs. Other animals in the region include the Himalayan tahr, which is sometimes the prey of the snow leopard. The Himalayan black bear can be found up to about and the red panda is also present in the region. One expedition found a surprising range of species in the region including a pika and ten new species of ants.

=== Conservation ===
From the Nepalese side, Everest is protected as part of Sagarmatha National Park, while from the Chinese side the mountain is protected as part of Qomolangma National Nature Reserve.

== Climate ==
Mount Everest has an ice cap climate (Köppen &quot;EF&quot;) with all months averaging well below freezing.

=== Climate change ===
The base camp for Everest expeditions based out of Nepal is located by Khumbu Glacier, which is rapidly thinning and destabilizing due to climate change, making it unsafe for climbers. As recommended by the committee formed by Nepal&#x27;s government to facilitate and monitor mountaineering in the Everest region, Taranath Adhikari—the director general of Nepal&#x27;s tourism department—said they have plans to move the base camp to a lower altitude. This would mean a longer distance for climbers between the base camp and Camp 1. However, the present base camp is still useful and could still serve its purpose for three to four years. The move may happen by 2024, per officials.

===Meteorology===

In 2008, a new weather station at about elevation went online. The project was orchestrated by Stations at High Altitude for Research on the Environment (SHARE), which also placed the Mount Everest webcam in 2011. The solar-powered weather station is on the South Col.

Mount Everest extends into the upper troposphere and penetrates the stratosphere. The air pressure at the summit is generally about one-third what it is at sea level. The altitude can expose the summit to the fast and freezing winds of the jet stream. Winds commonly attain ; in February 2004, a wind speed of was recorded at the summit.

These winds can hamper or endanger climbers, by blowing them into chasms or (by Bernoulli&#x27;s principle) by lowering the air pressure further, reducing available oxygen by up to 14 percent. To avoid the harshest winds, climbers typically aim for a 7- to 10-day window in the spring and fall when the Asian monsoon season is starting up or ending.

Mount Everest hosts several weather stations that collect important data on high-altitude weather conditions. Among them is the Balcony Station, the highest weather station on the planet, located at about 8,430 meters (27,657 feet) above sea level. Set up by climate scientists Tom Matthews and Baker Perry in 2019, this station is positioned just below the summit of Everest, which is the highest point on Earth.

As of January 20, 2020, the Balcony Station ceased transmitting data.

==Expeditions==

Because Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, it has attracted considerable attention and climbing attempts. Whether the mountain was climbed in ancient times is unknown. It may have been climbed in 1924, although this has never been confirmed, as neither of the men making the attempt returned. Several climbing routes have been established over several decades of climbing expeditions to the mountain.

Everest&#x27;s summit is first known to have been reached by a human in 1953, and interest from climbers increased thereafter. Despite the effort and attention poured into expeditions, only about 200 people had summited by 1987. Everest remained a difficult climb for decades, even for serious attempts by professional climbers and large national expeditions, which were the norm until the commercial era began in the 1990s. By March 2012, Everest had been climbed 5,656 times with 223 deaths. By 2013, The Himalayan Database recorded 6,871 summits by 4,042 different people.

Although lower mountains have longer or steeper climbs, Everest is so high the jet stream can hit it. Climbers can be faced with winds beyond when the weather shifts. At certain times of the year the jet stream shifts north, providing periods of relative calm at the mountain. Other dangers include blizzards and avalanches.

===Early attempts===
In 1885, Clinton Thomas Dent, president of the Alpine Club, suggested that climbing Mount Everest was possible in his book &quot;Above the Snow Line&quot;.

The northern approach to the mountain was discovered by George Mallory and Guy Bullock on the initial 1921 British Reconnaissance Expedition. It was an exploratory expedition not equipped for a serious attempt to climb the mountain. With Mallory leading (and thus becoming the first European to set foot on Everest&#x27;s flanks) they climbed the North Col to an altitude of . From there, Mallory espied a route to the top, but the party was unprepared to climb any further and descended.

The British returned for a 1922 expedition. George Finch climbed using oxygen for the first time. He ascended at a remarkable speed— per hour—and reached an altitude of , the first time a human reported to climb higher than 8,000 m. Mallory and Col. Felix Norton made a second unsuccessful attempt.

The next expedition was in 1924. The initial attempt by Mallory and Geoffrey Bruce was aborted when weather conditions prevented the establishment of Camp VI. The next attempt was that of Norton and Somervell, who climbed without oxygen and in perfect weather, traversing the North Face into the Great Couloir. Norton managed to reach , though he ascended only or so in the last hour. Mallory rustled up oxygen equipment for a last-ditch effort. He chose young Andrew Irvine as his partner.

On 8 June 1924, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made an attempt on the summit via the North Col-North Ridge-Northeast Ridge route from which they never returned. On 1 May 1999, the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition found Mallory&#x27;s body on the North Face in a snow basin below and to the west of the traditional site of Camp VI. Controversy has raged in the mountaineering community whether one or both of them reached the summit 29 years before the confirmed ascent and safe descent of Everest by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953.

In 1933, Lady Houston, a British millionairess, funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933, which saw a formation of two aeroplanes led by the Marquess of Clydesdale fly over the Everest summit.

Early expeditions—such as Charles Bruce&#x27;s in the 1920s and Hugh Ruttledge&#x27;s two unsuccessful attempts in 1933 and 1936—tried to ascend the mountain from Tibet, via the North Face. Access was closed from the north to Western expeditions in 1950 after China took control of Tibet. In 1950, Bill Tilman and a small party which included Charles Houston, Oscar Houston, and Betsy Cowles undertook an exploratory expedition to Everest through Nepal along the route which has now become the standard approach to Everest from the south.

The 1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition, led by Edouard Wyss-Dunant, was granted permission to attempt a climb from Nepal. It established a route through the Khumbu icefall and ascended to the South Col at an elevation of . Raymond Lambert and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay were able to reach an elevation of about on the southeast ridge, setting a new climbing altitude record. Tenzing&#x27;s experience was useful when he was hired to be part of the British expedition in 1953. The Swiss decided to make another post-monsoon attempt in the autumn; they made it to the South Col but were driven back by winter winds and severe cold.

===First successful ascent by Tenzing and Hillary, 1953===

In 1953, a ninth British expedition, led by John Hunt, returned to Nepal. Hunt selected two climbing pairs to attempt to reach the summit. The first pair, Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans, came within of the summit on 26 May 1953, but turned back after running into oxygen problems. As planned, their work in route finding and breaking trail and their oxygen caches were of great aid to the following pair. Two days later, the expedition made its second assault on the summit with the second climbing pair: the New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, a Nepali Sherpa climber. They reached the summit at 11:30am local time on 29 May 1953 via the South Col route. At the time, both acknowledged it as a team effort by the whole expedition, but Tenzing revealed a few years later that Hillary had put his foot on the summit first. They paused at the summit to take photographs and buried a few sweets and a small cross in the snow before descending.

===1950s–1960s===
On 23 May 1956, Ernst Schmied and Juerg Marmet ascended. This was followed by Dölf Reist and Hans-Rudolf von Gunten on 24 May 1957. Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo and Qu Yinhua of China made the first reported ascent of the peak from the North Ridge on 25 May 1960. The first American to climb Everest, Jim Whittaker, joined by Nawang Gombu, reached the summit on 1 May 1963 on the American Mount Everest expedition and on 22 May on the same expedition Tom Hornbein and Willi Unsoeld were the first the traverse the mountain by climbing via the North Face and descending via the South Col.

===1970s===
In 1970, Japanese mountaineers conducted a major expedition. The centrepiece was a large &quot;siege&quot;-style expedition led by Saburo Matsukata, working on finding a new route up the southwest face. Another element of the expedition was an attempt to ski Mount Everest. Despite a staff of over one hundred people and a decade of planning work, the expedition suffered eight deaths and failed to summit via the planned routes. However, Japanese expeditions did enjoy some successes. For example, Yuichiro Miura became the first man to ski down Everest from the South Col—he descended nearly from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries. Another success was an expedition that put four on the summit via the South Col route. Miura&#x27;s exploits became the subject of film, and he went on to become the oldest person to summit Mount Everest in 2003 at age 70 and again in 2013 at the age of 80.

In 1975, Junko Tabei became the first woman to summit Mount Everest.

The 1975 British Mount Everest Southwest Face expedition led and organised by Chris Bonington made the first ascent of the south west face of Everest from the Western Cwm.

The 1976 British and Nepalese Army Expedition to Everest led by Tony Streather put Bronco Lane and Brummy Stokes on the summit by the normal route.

In 1978, Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler made the first ascent of Everest without supplemental oxygen.

===1979/1980: Winter Himalaism===

The Polish climber Andrzej Zawada headed the first winter ascent of Mount Everest, the first winter ascent of an eight-thousander. The team of 20 Polish climbers and 4 Sherpas established a base camp on Khumbu Glacier in early January 1980. On 15 January, the team managed to set up Camp III at 7150 metres above sea level, but further action was stopped by hurricane-force winds. The weather improved after 11 February, when Leszek Cichy, Walenty Fiut and Krzysztof Wielicki set up camp IV on South Col (7906 m). Cichy and Wielicki started the final ascent at 6:50am on 17 February. At 2:40pm Andrzej Zawada at base camp heard the climbers&#x27; voices over the radio – &quot;We are on the summit! The strong wind blows all the time. It is unimaginably cold.&quot; The successful winter ascent of Mount Everest started a new decade of Winter Himalaism, which became a Polish specialisation. After 1980 Poles did ten first winter ascents on 8000 metre peaks, which earned Polish climbers a reputation of &quot;Ice Warriors&quot;.

===Lho La tragedy, 1989===
In May 1989, Polish climbers under the leadership of Eugeniusz Chrobak organised an international expedition to Mount Everest on a difficult western ridge. Ten Poles and nine foreigners participated, but ultimately only the Poles remained in the attempt for the summit. On 24 May, Chrobak and Andrzej Marciniak, starting from camp V at 8,200 m, overcame the ridge and reached the summit. But on 27 May, during an avalanche from the side of Khumbutse near the Lho La pass, four Polish climbers were killed: Mirosław Dąsal, Mirosław Gardzielewski, Zygmunt Andrzej Heinrich and Wacław Otręba. The following day, due to his injuries, Chrobak also died. Marciniak, who was also injured, was saved by a rescue expedition in which Artur Hajzer and New Zealanders Gary Ball and Rob Hall took part. In the organisation of the rescue expedition they took part, inter alia Reinhold Messner, Elizabeth Hawley, Carlos Carsolio and the US consul.

===1996 disaster===

On 10 and 11 May 1996, eight climbers died after several guided expeditions were caught in a blizzard high up on the mountain during a summit attempt on 10 May. During the 1996 season, 15 people died while climbing on Mount Everest. These were the highest death tolls for a single weather event, and for a single season, until the sixteen deaths in the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche. The guiding disaster gained wide publicity and raised questions about the commercialisation of climbing and the safety of guiding clients on Mount Everest.

Journalist Jon Krakauer, on assignment from &quot;Outside&quot; magazine, was in one of the affected guided parties, and afterward published the bestseller &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;, which related his experience. Krakauer was critical of guide Anatoli Boukreev in his recollection of the expedition. A year later, Boukreev co-authored &quot;The Climb&quot;, in part as a rebuttal of Krakauer&#x27;s portrayal. The dispute sparked a debate within the climbing community. Boukreev was later awarded The American Alpine Club&#x27;s David Sowles Award for his rescue efforts on the expedition.

In May 2004, physicist Kent Moore and surgeon John L. Semple, both researchers from the University of Toronto, told &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine that an analysis of weather conditions on 11 May suggested that weather caused oxygen levels to plunge about 14 per cent.

One of the survivors was Beck Weathers, left for dead about 275 metres (900 feet) from Camp 4 at 7,950 metres (26,085 feet). After spending a night on the mountain, Weathers managed to make it back to Camp 4 with massive frostbite and vision impaired due to snow blindness. When he arrived at Camp 4, fellow climbers considered his condition terminal and left him in a tent to die overnight. Weathers was lowered to Camp 2 and eventually a helicopter rescue was organised thanks to the Nepali Army.

The storm&#x27;s impact on climbers on the North Ridge of Everest, where several climbers also died, was detailed in a first-hand account by British filmmaker and writer Matt Dickinson in his book &quot;The Other Side of Everest&quot;. Sixteen-year-old Mark Pfetzer was on the climb and wrote about it in his account, &quot;Within Reach: My Everest Story&quot;.

The 2015 feature film &quot;Everest&quot;, directed by Baltasar Kormákur, is based on the events of this guiding disaster.

===2006 mountaineering season===
In 2006, 12 people died. One death in particular (see below) triggered an international debate and years of discussion about climbing ethics. The season was also remembered for the rescue of Lincoln Hall who had been left by his climbing team and declared dead, but was later discovered alive and survived being helped off the mountain.

====David Sharp ethics controversy, 2006====
There was an international controversy about the death of a solo British climber David Sharp, who attempted to climb Mount Everest in 2006 but died in his attempt. The story broke out of the mountaineering community into popular media, with a series of interviews, allegations, and critiques. The question was whether climbers that season had left a man to die and whether he could have been saved. He was said to have attempted to summit Mount Everest by himself with no Sherpa or guide and fewer oxygen bottles than considered normal. He went with a low-budget Nepali guide firm that only provides support up to Base Camp, after which climbers go as a &quot;loose group&quot;, offering a high degree of independence. The manager at Sharp&#x27;s guide support said Sharp did not take enough oxygen for his summit attempt and did not have a Sherpa guide. It is less clear who knew Sharp was in trouble, and if they did know, whether they were qualified or capable of helping him.

Double-amputee climber Mark Inglis said in an interview that on 15 May his climbing party, and many others, had passed Sharp, sheltering under a rock overhang below the summit, without attempting a rescue. Inglis said 40 people had passed by Sharp, but he might have been overlooked as climbers assumed Sharp was the corpse nicknamed &quot;Green Boots&quot;, but Inglis was not aware that Turkish climbers had tried to help Sharp despite being in the process of helping an injured woman down (a Turkish woman, Burçak Poçan). There has also been some discussion about Himex in the commentary on Inglis and Sharp. In regard to Inglis&#x27;s initial comments, he later revised certain details because he had been interviewed while he was &quot;physically and mentally exhausted, and in a lot of pain. He had suffered severe frostbite – he later had five fingertips amputated.&quot; It was estimated that Sharp summited Mount Everest on 14 May and began his descent down, but on 15 May he was in trouble and being passed by climbers on their way up and down. It is believed he was suffering from hypoxia and was about from the summit on the North Side route.

&quot;The Tribune&quot; of Chandigarh, India quoted someone who described what happened to Sharp as &quot;the most shameful act in the history of mountaineering&quot;. In addition to Sharp&#x27;s death, at least nine other climbers perished that year, including multiple Sherpas working for various guiding companies.

Much of this controversy was captured by the &quot;Discovery Channel&quot; while filming the television program &quot;&quot;. A crucial decision affecting the fate of Sharp is shown in the program, where an early returning climber, Lebanese adventurer Maxim Chaya, is descending from the summit and radios to his base camp manager (Russell Brice) that he has found a frostbitten and unconscious climber in distress. Chaya is unable to identify Sharp, who had chosen to climb solo without any support and so did not identify himself to other climbers. The base camp manager assumes that Sharp is part of a group that has already calculated that they must abandon him, and informs his lone climber that there is no chance of him being able to help Sharp by himself. As Sharp&#x27;s condition deteriorates through the day and other descending climbers pass him, his opportunities for rescue diminish: his legs and feet curl from frostbite, preventing him from walking; the later descending climbers are lower on oxygen and lack the strength to offer aid; time runs out for any Sherpas to return and rescue him.

David Sharp&#x27;s body remained just below the summit on the Chinese side next to &quot;Green Boots&quot;; they shared a space in a small rock cave that was an ad hoc tomb for them. Sharp&#x27;s body was removed from the cave in 2007, according to the BBC, and since 2014, Green Boots has been missing, presumably removed or buried.

====Lincoln Hall rescue, 2006====
As the Sharp debate kicked off on 26 May 2006, Australian climber Lincoln Hall was found alive after being left for dead the day before. He was found by a party of four climbers (Dan Mazur, Andrew Brash, Myles Osborne and Jangbu Sherpa) who, giving up their own summit attempt, stayed with Hall and descended with him and a party of 11 Sherpas sent up to carry him down. Hall later fully recovered. His team assumed he had died from cerebral edema, and they were instructed to cover him with rocks. There were no rocks around to do this and he was abandoned. The erroneous information of his death was passed on to his family. The next day he was discovered alive by another party.

===2007===
On 21 May 2007, Canadian climber Meagan McGrath initiated the successful high-altitude rescue of Nepali Usha Bista. Major McGrath was selected as a 2011 recipient of the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation of Canada Humanitarian Award, which recognises a Canadian who has personally or administratively contributed a significant service or act in the Himalayan Region of Nepal.

===Ascent statistics up to 2010 season===

By the end of the 2010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to the summit by about 3,142 individuals, with 77 per cent of these ascents being accomplished since 2000. The summit was achieved in 7 of the 22 years from 1953 to 1974 and was not missed between 1975 and 2014. In 2007, the record number of 633 ascents was recorded, by 350 climbers and 253 sherpas.

An illustration of the explosion of popularity of Everest is provided by the numbers of daily ascents. Analysis of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster shows that part of the blame was on the bottleneck caused by a large number of climbers (33 to 36) attempting to summit on the same day; this was considered unusually high at the time. By comparison, on 23 May 2010, the summit of Mount Everest was reached by 169 climbers – more summits in a single day than in the cumulative 31 years from the first successful summit in 1953 through 1983.

There have been 219 fatalities recorded on Mount Everest from the 1922 British Mount Everest Expedition through the end of 2010, a rate of 4.3 fatalities for every 100 summits (this is a general rate, and includes fatalities amongst support climbers, those who turned back before the peak, those who died en route to the peak and those who died while descending from the peak). Of the 219 fatalities, 58 (26.5 per cent) were climbers who had summited but did not complete their descent. Though the rate of fatalities has decreased since the year 2000 (1.4 fatalities for every 100 summits, with 3938 summits since 2000), the significant increase in the total number of climbers still means 54 fatalities since 2000: 33 on the northeast ridge, 17 on the southeast ridge, 2 on the southwest face, and 2 on the north face.

Nearly all attempts at the summit are done using one of the two main routes. The traffic seen by each route varies from year to year. In 2005–07, more than half of all climbers elected to use the more challenging, but cheaper northeast route. In 2008, the northeast route was closed by the Chinese government for the entire climbing season, and the only people able to reach the summit from the north that year were athletes responsible for carrying the Olympic torch for the 2008 Summer Olympics. The route was closed to foreigners once again in 2009 in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s exile. These closures led to declining interest in the north route, and, in 2010, two-thirds of the climbers reached the summit from the south.

===2010s===
The 2010s were a time of new highs and lows for the mountain, with back-to-back disasters in 2013 and 2014 causing record deaths. In 2015 there were no summits for the first time in decades. However, other years set records for numbers of summits – 2013&#x27;s record number of summiters, around 667, was surpassed in 2018 with around 800 summiting the peak, and a subsequent record was set in 2019 with over 890 summiters.


===2014 avalanche and season===

On 18 April 2014, an avalanche hit the area just below Base Camp 2. Sixteen people were killed (all Nepali guides) and nine more were injured. In response to the tragedy, numerous Sherpa climbing guides walked off the job and most climbing companies pulled out in respect for the Sherpa people mourning the loss.

During the season, 13-year-old Malavath Purna reached the summit, becoming the youngest female climber to do so. One team used a helicopter to fly from South base camp to Camp 2 to avoid the Khumbu Icefall, then reached the Everest summit. This team had to use the south side because the Chinese had denied them a permit to climb. A team member (Jing Wang) donated US$30,000 to a local hospital. She was named the Nepali &quot;International Mountaineer of the Year&quot;.


Over 100 people summited Everest from China (Tibet region), and six from Nepal in the 2014 season. This included 72-year-old Bill Burke, the Indian teenage girl, and a Chinese woman Jing Wang. Another teen girl summiter was Ming Kipa Sherpa who summited with her elder sister Lhakpa Sherpa in 2003, and who had achieved the most times for woman to the summit of Mount Everest at that time. (see also Santosh Yadav)

===2015 avalanche, earthquake, season===

2015 was set to be a record-breaking season of climbs, with hundreds of permits issued in Nepal and many additional permits in Tibet (China). However, on 25 April 2015, an earthquake measuring 7.8 Mw triggered an avalanche that hit Everest Base Camp, effectively shutting down the Everest climbing season. 18 bodies were recovered from Mount Everest by the Indian Army mountaineering team. The avalanche began on Pumori, moved through the Khumbu Icefall on the southwest side of Mount Everest, and slammed into the South Base Camp. 2015 was the first time since 1974 with no spring summits, as all climbing teams pulled out after the quakes and avalanche. One of the reasons for this was the high probability of aftershocks (over 50 per cent according to the United States Geological Survey). Just weeks after the first quake, the region was rattled again by a 7.3 magnitude quake and there were also many considerable aftershocks.

The quakes trapped hundreds of climbers above the Khumbu icefall, and they had to be evacuated by helicopter as they ran low on supplies. The quake shifted the route through the ice fall, making it essentially impassable to climbers. Bad weather also made helicopter evacuation difficult. The Everest tragedy was small compared to the impact overall on Nepal, with almost nine thousand dead and about 22,000 injured. In Tibet, by 28 April at least 25 had died, and 117 were injured. By 29 April 2015, the Tibet Mountaineering Association (North/Chinese side) closed Everest and other peaks to climbing, stranding 25 teams and about 300 people on the north side of Everest. On the south side, helicopters evacuated 180 people trapped at Camps 1 and 2.

On 24 August 2015, Nepal re-opened Everest to tourism including mountain climbers. The only climber permit for the autumn season was awarded to Japanese climber Nobukazu Kuriki, who had tried four times previously to summit Everest without success. He made his fifth attempt in October, but had to give up just from the summit due to &quot;strong winds and deep snow&quot;.

Some sections of the trail from Lukla to Everest Base Camp (Nepal) were damaged in the earthquakes earlier in the year and needed repairs to handle trekkers.

===2016 season===

Hawley&#x27;s database records 641 made it to the summit in early 2016.

===2017 season===

2017 was the biggest season yet, permit-wise, yielding hundreds of summiters and a handful of deaths. On 27 May 2017, Kami Rita made his 21st climb to the summit with the Alpine Ascents Everest Expedition, one of three people in the World along with Apa Sherpa and Phurba Tashi Sherpa to make it to the summit of Mount Everest 21 times. The season had a tragic start with the death of Ueli Steck of Switzerland, who died from a fall during a warm-up climb. There was a continued discussion about the nature of possible changes to the Hillary Step. Total summiters for 2017 was tallied up to be 648. 449 summited via Nepal (from the South) and 120 from Chinese Tibet (North side).

===2018===
807 climbers summited Mount Everest in 2018, including 563 on the Nepal side and 240 from the Chinese Tibet side. This broke the previous record for total summits in year from which was 667 in 2013, and one factor that aided in this was an especially long and clear weather window of 11 days during the critical spring climbing season. Various records were broken, including a summit by double-amputee Xia Boyu, who undertook his climb after winning a court case in the Nepali Supreme Court. There were no major disasters, but seven climbers including sherpas as well as international climbers, died in various situations. Although record numbers of climbers reached the summit, old-time summiters that made expeditions in the 1980s lamented the crowding, feces, and cost.

Figures for the number of permits issued by Nepal range from 347 to 375.

===2019===
The spring or pre-monsoon window for 2019 witnessed the deaths of a number of climbers. Worldwide publication of images of hundreds of mountaineers queuing to reach the summit and sensational media reports of climbers stepping over dead bodies dismayed people around the world.

There were reports of various winter expeditions in the Himalayas, including K2, Nanga Parbat, and Meru with the buzz for the Everest 2019 beginning just 14 weeks to the weather window. Noted climber Cory Richards announced on Twitter that he was hoping to establish a new climbing route to the summit in 2019. Also announced was an expedition to re-measure the height of Everest, particularly in light of the 2015 earthquakes. China closed the base-camp to those without climbing permits in February 2019 on the northern side of Mount Everest. By early April, climbing teams from around the world were arriving for the 2019 spring climbing season. Among the teams was a scientific expedition with a planned study of pollution, and how things like snow and vegetation influence the availability of food and water in the region. In the 2019 spring mountaineering season, there were roughly 40 teams with almost 400 climbers and several hundred guides attempting to summit on the Nepali side. Nepal issued 381 climbing permits for 2019. For the northern routes in Chinese Tibet, several hundred more permits were issued for climbing by authorities there.

In May 2019, Nepali mountaineering guide Kami Rita summited Mount Everest twice within a week, his 23rd and 24th ascents, making international news headlines. He first summited Everest in 1994, and has summited several other extremely high mountains, such as K2 and Lhotse.

By 23 May 2019, about seven people had died, possibly due to crowding leading to delays high on the mountain, and shorter weather windows. One 19-year-old who summited previously noted that when the weather window opens, long lines form as everyone rushes to get the top and back down. In Chinese Tibet, one Austrian climber died from a fall, and by 26 May 2019 the overall number of deaths for the spring climbing season rose to 10. By 28 May, the death toll increased to 11 when a climber died at about during the descent, and a 12th climber missing and presumed dead. Despite the number of deaths, reports indicated that a record 891 climbers summited in the spring 2019 climbing season.

Although China has had various permit restrictions, and Nepal requires a doctor to sign off on climbing permits, the natural dangers of climbing such as falls and avalanches combined with medical issues aggravated by Everest&#x27;s extreme altitude led to 2019 being a year with a comparatively high death toll.

=== 2020s ===
Both Nepal and China prohibited foreign climbing groups during the 2020 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 2020 was the third year in this decade after 2014 and 2015 which saw no summits from the Nepal (South) Side.

A team of Chinese surveyors climbed Mt. Everest from the North side during April–May 2020, becoming the only climbers to summit the world&#x27;s highest peak during the pandemic, at least through May. The team was there to re-measure the height of Mount Everest.

On 12 May 2022, the first all-Black team summited Mt. Everest. Seven men and two women climbers from the U.S. and Kenya, guided by eight sherpas, comprised the expedition.

===Permits===
In 2014, Nepal issued 334 climbing permits, which were extended until 2019 due to the closure. In 2015, Nepal issued 357 permits, but the mountain was closed again because of the avalanche and earthquake, and these permits were given a two-year extension to 2017.

In 2017, a person who tried to climb Everest without the $11,000 permit was caught after he made it past the Khumbu icefall. He faced, among other penalties, a $22,000 fine and a possible four years in jail. In the end, he was allowed to return home but banned from mountaineering in Nepal for 10 years.

The number of permits issued each year by Nepal is:
* 2008: 160
* 2009: 220
* 2010: 209
* 2011: 225
* 2012: 208
* 2013: 316
* 2014: 326 (extended for use through 2019)

The Chinese side in Tibet is also managed with permits for summiting Everest. They did not issue permits in 2008, due to the Olympic torch relay being taken to the summit of Mount Everest.

In March 2020, the governments of China and Nepal cancelled all climbing permits for Mount Everest due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, a group of Chinese mountaineers began an expedition from the Chinese side. The mountain remained closed on the Chinese side to all foreign climbers. On 10 May 2021, a separation line was announced by Chinese authorities to prevent the spread of coronavirus from climbers ascending Nepal&#x27;s side.

===Commercial climbing===


According to Jon Krakauer, the era of commercialisation of Everest started in 1985, when the summit was reached by a guided expedition led by David Breashears that included Richard Bass, a wealthy 55-year-old businessman and an amateur mountain climber with four years of climbing experience. By the early-1990s, several companies were offering guided tours to the mountain. Rob Hall, one of the mountaineers who died in the 1996 disaster, had successfully guided 39 clients to the summit before that incident.

By 2016, most guiding services cost between US$35,000 and US$200,000. Going with a &quot;celebrity guide&quot;, usually a well-known mountaineer typically with decades of climbing experience and perhaps several Everest summits, can cost over £100,000 as of 2015. However, the services offered vary widely and it is &quot;buyer beware&quot; when doing deals in Nepal, one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world. Tourism contributed 7.9 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 in a country with high unemployment, but an Everest porter can make nearly double the nation&#x27;s average wage in a region in which other sources of income are lacking.

Costs beyond the guiding service can vary widely. It is technically possible to reach the summit with minimal additional expenses, and there are &quot;budget&quot; travel agencies that offer logistical support for such trips. A limited support service, offering only some meals at base camp and bureaucratic overhead like a permit, can cost as little as US$7,000 as of 2007. However, this is considered difficult and dangerous (as illustrated by the case of David Sharp).

Climbing gear required to reach the summit may cost in excess of US$8,000, and most climbers also use bottled oxygen, which adds around US$3,000. The permit to enter the Everest area from the south via Nepal costs US$10,000 to US$30,000 per person, depending on the size of the team. The ascent typically starts at one of the two base camps near the mountain, both of which are approximately from Kathmandu and from Lhasa (the two nearest cities with major airports). Transferring one&#x27;s equipment from the airport to the base camp may add as much as US$2,000.

Many climbers hire &quot;full service&quot; guide companies, which provide a wide spectrum of services, including the acquisition of permits, transportation to/from base camp, food, tents, fixed ropes, medical assistance while on the mountain, an experienced mountaineer guide, and even personal porters to carry one&#x27;s backpack and cook one&#x27;s meals. The cost of such a guide service may range from US$40,000 to $80,000 per person. Since most equipment is moved by Sherpas, clients of full-service guide companies can often keep their backpack weights under , or hire a Sherpa to carry their backpack for them. By contrast, climbers attempting less commercialised peaks, like Denali, are often expected to carry backpacks over and, occasionally, to tow a sled with of gear and food.

The degree of commercialisation of Mount Everest is a frequent subject of criticism. Jamling Tenzing Norgay, the son of Tenzing Norgay, said in a 2003 interview that his late father would have been shocked to discover that rich thrill-seekers with no climbing experience were now routinely reaching the summit, &quot;You still have to climb this mountain yourself with your feet. But the spirit of adventure is not there any more. It is lost. There are people going up there who have no idea how to put on crampons. They are climbing because they have paid someone $65,000. It is very selfish. It endangers the lives of others.&quot;

One example of this is Shriya Shah-Klorfine, who had to be taught how to put on crampons during her summit attempt in 2012. She paid at least US$40,000 to a new guiding company for the trip, and died when she ran out of oxygen during the descent after climbing for 27 hours straight.

Reinhold Messner concurred in 2004: You could die in each climb and that meant you were responsible for yourself. We were real mountaineers: careful, aware and even afraid. By climbing mountains we were not learning how big we were. We were finding out how breakable, how weak and how full of fear we are. You can only get this if you expose yourself to high danger. I have always said that a mountain without danger is not a mountain...High altitude alpinism has become tourism and show. These commercial trips to Everest, they are still dangerous. But the guides and organisers tell clients, &#x27;Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s all organised.&#x27; The route is prepared by hundreds of Sherpas. Extra oxygen is available in all camps, right up to the summit. People will cook for you and lay out your beds. Clients feel safe and don&#x27;t care about the risks.

By 2015, Nepal was considering requiring that climbers have some experience, hoping this would both make the mountain safer and increase revenue. One barrier to this is that low-budget firms make money &quot;not&quot; taking inexperienced climbers to the summit. Those turned away by Western firms can often find another firm willing to take them for a price—that they return home soon after arriving after base camp, or part way up the mountain.

However, not all opinions on the subject among prominent mountaineers have been strictly negative. For example, Edmund Hillary stated in 2003 that while &quot;Having people pay $65,000 and then be led up the mountain by a couple of experienced guides...isn&#x27;t really mountaineering at all&quot;, he was pleased by the changes brought to Everest area by Westerners: I don&#x27;t have any regrets because I worked very hard indeed to improve the condition for the local people. When we first went in there they didn&#x27;t have any schools, they didn&#x27;t have any medical facilities, all over the years we have established 27 schools, we have two hospitals and a dozen medical clinics and then we&#x27;ve built bridges over wild mountain rivers and put in fresh water pipelines so in cooperation with the Sherpas we&#x27;ve done a lot to benefit them.

One of the early guided summiters, Richard Bass (of Seven Summits fame) stated in 2003 that &quot;Climbers should have high altitude experience before they attempt the really big mountains. People don&#x27;t realise the difference between a mountain and . It&#x27;s not just arithmetic. The reduction of oxygen in the air is proportionate to the altitude alright, but the effect on the human body is disproportionate—an exponential curve. People climb Denali [] or Aconcagua [] and think, &#x27;Heck, I feel great up here, I&#x27;m going to try Everest.&#x27; But it&#x27;s not like that.&quot;

===Routes===
Mount Everest has two main climbing routes, the southeast ridge from Nepal and the north ridge from Tibet, as well as many other less frequently climbed routes. Of the two main routes, the southeast ridge is technically easier and more frequently used. It was the route used by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 and the first recognised of 15 routes to the top by 1996. This was, however, a route decision dictated more by politics than by design, as the Chinese border was closed to the western world in the 1950s, after Annexation of Tibet by the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Most attempts are made during May, before the summer monsoon season. As the monsoon season approaches, the jet stream shifts northward, thereby reducing the average wind speeds high on the mountain. While attempts are sometimes made in September and October, after the monsoons, when the jet stream is again temporarily pushed northward, the additional snow deposited by the monsoons and the less stable weather patterns at the monsoons&#x27; tail end makes climbing extremely difficult.

====Southeast ridge====
The ascent via the southeast ridge begins with a trek to Base Camp at on the south side of Everest, in Nepal. Expeditions usually fly into Lukla (2,860 m) from Kathmandu and pass through Namche Bazaar. Climbers then hike to Base Camp, which usually takes six to eight days, allowing for proper altitude acclimatisation in order to prevent altitude sickness. Climbing equipment and supplies are carried by yaks, dzopkyos (yak-cow hybrids), and human porters to Base Camp on the Khumbu Glacier. When Hillary and Tenzing climbed Everest in 1953, the British expedition they were part of (comprising over 400 climbers, porters, and Sherpas at that point) started from the Kathmandu Valley, as there were no roads further east at that time.

Climbers spend a couple of weeks in Base Camp, acclimatising to the altitude. During that time, Sherpas and some expedition climbers set up ropes and ladders in the treacherous Khumbu Icefall.

Seracs, crevasses, and shifting blocks of ice make the icefall one of the most dangerous sections of the route. Many climbers and Sherpas have been killed in this section. To reduce the hazard, climbers usually begin their ascent well before dawn, when the freezing temperatures glue ice blocks in place.

Above the icefall is Camp I at .

From Camp I, climbers make their way up the Western Cwm to the base of the Lhotse face, where Camp II or Advanced Base Camp (ABC) is established at . The Western Cwm is a flat, gently rising glacial valley, marked by huge lateral crevasses in the centre, which prevent direct access to the upper reaches of the Cwm. Climbers are forced to cross on the far right, near the base of Nuptse, to a small passageway known as the &quot;Nuptse corner&quot;. The Western Cwm is also called the &quot;Valley of Silence&quot; as the topography of the area generally cuts off wind from the climbing route. The high altitude and a clear, windless day can make the Western Cwm unbearably hot for climbers.

From Camp II, climbers ascend the Lhotse face on fixed ropes, up to Camp III, located on a small ledge at . From there, it is another 500 metres to Camp IV on the South Col at .

From Camp III to Camp IV, climbers are faced with two additional challenges: the Geneva Spur and the Yellow Band. The Geneva Spur is an anvil-shaped rib of black rock named by the 1952 Swiss expedition. Fixed ropes assist climbers in scrambling over this snow-covered rock band. The Yellow Band is a section of interlayered marble, phyllite, and semischist, which also requires about 100 metres of rope for traversing it.

On the South Col, climbers enter the death zone. Climbers making summit bids typically can endure no more than two or three days at this altitude. If the weather is not clear with low winds during these short few days, climbers are forced to descend, many all the way back down to Base Camp.

From Camp IV, climbers begin their summit push around midnight, with hopes of reaching the summit (still another 1,000 metres above) within 10 to 12 hours. Climbers first reach &quot;The Balcony&quot; at , a small platform where they can rest and gaze at peaks to the south and east in the early light of dawn. Continuing up the ridge, climbers are then faced with a series of imposing rock steps which usually forces them to the east into the waist-deep snow, a serious avalanche hazard. At , a small table-sized dome of ice and snow marks the South Summit.

From the South Summit, climbers follow the knife-edge southeast ridge along what is known as the &quot;Cornice traverse&quot;, where snow clings to intermittent rock. This is the most exposed section of the climb, and a misstep to the left would send one down the southwest face, while to the immediate right is the Kangshung Face. At the end of this traverse is an imposing rock wall, the Hillary Step, at .

Hillary and Tenzing were the first climbers to ascend this step, and they did so using primitive ice climbing equipment and ropes. Nowadays, climbers ascend this step using fixed ropes previously set up by Sherpas. Once above the step, it is a comparatively easy climb to the top on moderately angled snow slopes—though the exposure on the ridge is extreme, especially while traversing large cornices of snow. With increasing numbers of people climbing the mountain in recent years, the Step has frequently become a bottleneck, with climbers forced to wait significant amounts of time for their turn on the ropes, leading to problems in getting climbers efficiently up and down the mountain.

After the Hillary Step, climbers also must traverse a loose and rocky section that has a large entanglement of fixed ropes that can be troublesome in bad weather. Climbers typically spend less than half an hour at the summit to allow time to descend to Camp IV before darkness sets in, to avoid serious problems with afternoon weather, or because supplemental oxygen tanks run out.

====North ridge route====
The north ridge route begins from the north side of Everest, in Tibet. Expeditions trek to the Rongbuk Glacier, setting up base camp at on a gravel plain just below the glacier. To reach Camp II, climbers ascend the medial moraine of the east Rongbuk Glacier up to the base of Changtse, at around . Camp III (ABCAdvanced Base Camp) is situated below the North Col at . To reach Camp IV on the North Col, climbers ascend the glacier to the foot of the col where fixed ropes are used to reach the North Col at . From the North Col, climbers ascend the rocky north ridge to set up Camp V at around . The route crosses the North Face in a diagonal climb to the base of the Yellow Band, reaching the site of Camp VI at . From Camp VI, climbers make their final summit push.

Climbers face a treacherous traverse from the base of the First Step: ascending from , to the crux of the climb, the Second Step, ascending from . (The Second Step includes a climbing aid called the &quot;Chinese ladder&quot;, a metal ladder placed semi-permanently in 1975 by a party of Chinese climbers. It has been almost continuously in place since, and ladders have been used by virtually all climbers on the route.) Once above the Second Step the inconsequential Third Step is clambered over, ascending from . Once above these steps, the summit pyramid is climbed by a snow slope of 50 degrees, to the final summit ridge along which the top is reached.

===Summit===

The summit of Everest has been described as &quot;the size of a dining room table&quot;. The summit is capped with snow over ice over rock, and the layer of snow varies from year to year. The rock summit is made of Ordovician limestone and is a low-grade metamorphic rock. (See the Surveys section for more on its height and about the Everest rock summit.)

Below the summit, there is an area known as &quot;rainbow valley&quot;, filled with dead bodies still wearing brightly coloured winter gear. Down to about is an area commonly called the &quot;death zone&quot;, due to the high danger and low oxygen because of the low pressure.

Below the summit the mountain slopes downward to the three main sides, or faces, of Mount Everest: the North Face, the South-West Face, and the East/Kangshung Face.

===Death zone===

At the higher regions of Mount Everest, climbers seeking the summit typically spend substantial time within the death zone (altitudes higher than ), and face significant challenges to survival. Temperatures can dip to very low levels, resulting in frostbite of any body part exposed to the air. Since temperatures are so low, snow is well-frozen in certain areas and death or injury by slipping and falling can occur. High winds at these altitudes on Everest are also a potential threat to climbers.

Another significant threat to climbers is low atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure at the top of Everest is about a third of sea level pressure or , resulting in the availability of only about a third as much oxygen to breathe.

Debilitating effects of the death zone are so great that it takes most climbers up to 12 hours to walk the distance of from South Col to the summit. Achieving even this level of performance requires prolonged altitude acclimatisation, which takes 40–60 days for a typical expedition. A sea-level dweller exposed to the atmospheric conditions at the altitude above without acclimatisation would likely lose consciousness within two to three minutes.

In May 2007, the Caudwell Xtreme Everest undertook a medical study of oxygen levels in human blood at extreme altitude. Over 200 volunteers climbed to Everest Base Camp where various medical tests were performed to examine blood oxygen levels. A small team also performed tests on the way to the summit. Even at base camp, the low partial pressure of oxygen had direct effect on blood oxygen saturation levels. At sea level, blood oxygen saturation is generally 98 to 99 per cent. At base camp, blood saturation fell to between 85 and 87 per cent. Blood samples taken at the summit indicated very low oxygen levels in the blood. A side effect of low blood oxygen is a greatly increased breathing rate, often 80–90 breaths per minute as opposed to a more typical 20–30. Exhaustion can occur merely by attempting to breathe.

Lack of oxygen, exhaustion, extreme cold, and climbing hazards all contribute to the death toll. An injured person who cannot walk is in serious trouble, since rescue by helicopter is generally impractical and carrying the person off the mountain is very risky. People who die during the climb are typically left behind. As of 2015, over 200 bodies remain on the mountain.

A 2008 study noted that the &quot;death zone&quot; is indeed where most Everest deaths occur, but also noted that most deaths occur during descent from the summit. A 2014 article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; about deaths on Everest noted that while falling is one of the greatest dangers the death zone presents for all 8000ers, avalanches are a more common cause of death at lower altitudes.

Despite this, Everest is safer for climbers than a number of peaks by some measurements, but it depends on the period. Some examples are Kangchenjunga, K2, Annapurna, Nanga Parbat, and the Eiger (especially the &quot;nordwand&quot;). Some factors that affect total mountain lethality include the level of popularity of the mountain, the skill of those climbing, and the difficulty of the climb.

Another health hazard is retinal haemorrhages, which can damage eyesight and cause blindness. Up to a quarter of Everest climbers can experience retinal haemorrhages, and although they usually heal within weeks of returning to lower altitudes, in 2010 a climber went blind and died in the death zone.

The team made a huge effort for the next 12 hours to try to get him down the mountain, but to no avail, as they were unsuccessful in getting him through the difficult sections. Even for the able, the Everest North-East ridge is recognised as a challenge. It is hard to rescue someone who has become incapacitated and it can be beyond the ability of rescuers to save &quot;anyone&quot; in such a difficult spot. One way around this situation was pioneered by two Nepali men in 2011, who had intended to paraglide off the summit. They had no choice and were forced to go through with their plan anyway, because they had run out of bottled oxygen and supplies. They successfully launched off the summit and para-glided down to Namche Bazaar in just 42 minutes, without having to climb down the mountain.

===Supplemental oxygen===

Most expeditions use oxygen masks and tanks above . Everest can be climbed without supplementary oxygen, but only by the most accomplished mountaineers and at increased risk. Humans&#x27; ability to think clearly is hindered with low oxygen, and the combination of extreme weather, low temperatures, and steep slopes often requires quick, accurate decisions. While about 95 per cent of climbers who reach the summit use bottled oxygen in order to reach the top, about five per cent of climbers have summited Everest without supplemental oxygen. The death rate is double for those who attempt to reach the summit without supplemental oxygen. Travelling above altitude is a factor in cerebral hypoxia. One study found that Mount Everest may be the highest an acclimatised human could go, but also found that climbers may suffer permanent neurological damage despite returning to lower altitudes.

The use of bottled oxygen to ascend Mount Everest has been controversial. It was first used on the 1922 British Mount Everest Expedition by George Finch and Geoffrey Bruce who climbed up to at a spectacular speed of per hour. Pinned down by a fierce storm, they escaped death by breathing oxygen from a jury-rigged set-up during the night. The next day they climbed to at – nearly three times as fast as non-oxygen users. Yet the use of oxygen was considered so unsportsmanlike that none of the rest of the Alpine world recognised this high ascent rate.

George Mallory described the use of such oxygen as unsportsmanlike, but he later concluded that it would be impossible for him to summit without it and consequently used it on his final attempt in 1924. When Tenzing and Hillary made the first successful summit in 1953, they also used open-circuit bottled oxygen sets, with the expedition&#x27;s physiologist Griffith Pugh referring to the oxygen debate as a &quot;futile controversy&quot;, noting that oxygen &quot;greatly increases subjective appreciation of the surroundings, which after all is one of the chief reasons for climbing.&quot; For the next twenty-five years, bottled oxygen was considered standard for any successful summit.

Reinhold Messner was the first climber to break the bottled oxygen tradition and in 1978, with Peter Habeler, made the first successful climb without it. In 1980, Messner summited the mountain solo, without supplemental oxygen or any porters or climbing partners, on the more difficult northwest route. Once the climbing community was satisfied that the mountain could be climbed without supplemental oxygen, many purists then took the next logical step of insisting that is how it &quot;should&quot; be climbed.

The aftermath of the 1996 disaster further intensified the debate. Jon Krakauer&#x27;s &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; (1997) expressed the author&#x27;s personal criticisms of the use of bottled oxygen. Krakauer wrote that the use of bottled oxygen allowed otherwise unqualified climbers to attempt to summit, leading to dangerous situations and more deaths. The disaster was partially caused by the sheer number of climbers (34 on that day) attempting to ascend, causing bottlenecks at the Hillary Step and delaying many climbers, most of whom summited after the usual 14:00 turnaround time. He proposed banning bottled oxygen except for emergency cases, arguing that this would both decrease the growing pollution on Everest—many bottles have accumulated on its slopes—and keep marginally qualified climbers off the mountain.

The 1996 disaster also introduced the issue of the guide&#x27;s role in using bottled oxygen.

Guide Anatoli Boukreev&#x27;s decision not to use bottled oxygen was sharply criticised by Jon Krakauer. Boukreev&#x27;s supporters (who include G. Weston DeWalt, who co-wrote &quot;The Climb&quot;) state that using bottled oxygen gives a false sense of security. Krakauer and his supporters point out that, without bottled oxygen, Boukreev could not directly help his clients descend.

The low oxygen can cause a mental fog-like impairment of cognitive abilities described as &quot;delayed and lethargic thought process, clinically defined as bradypsychia&quot; even after returning to lower altitudes. In severe cases, climbers can experience hallucinations. Some studies have found that high-altitude climbers, including Everest climbers, experience altered brain structure. 

===Autumn climbing===
Although generally less popular than spring, Mount Everest has also been climbed in the autumn (also called the &quot;post-monsoon season&quot;). For example, in 2010 Eric Larsen and five Nepali guides summited Everest in the autumn for the first time in ten years. The autumn season, when the monsoon ends, is regarded as more dangerous because there is typically a lot of new snow which can be unstable. However, this increased snow can make it more popular with certain winter sports like skiing and snowboarding. Two Japanese climbers also summited in October 1973.

Chris Chandler and Bob Cormack summited Everest in October 1976 as part of the American Bicentennial Everest Expedition that year, the first Americans to make an autumn ascent of Mount Everest according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. By the 21st century, summer and autumn can be more popular with skiing and snowboard attempts on Mount Everest. During the 1980s, climbing in autumn was actually more popular than in spring. U.S. astronaut Karl Gordon Henize died in October 1993 on an autumn expedition, conducting an experiment on radiation. The amount of background radiation increases with higher altitudes.

The mountain has also been climbed in the winter, but that is not popular because of the combination of cold high winds and shorter days. By January the peak is typically battered by winds and the average temperature of the summit is around −33 °F (−36 °C).

===Thefts and crime===
Some climbers have reported life-threatening thefts from supply caches. In May 2006, Vitor Negrete, the first Brazilian to climb Everest without oxygen and part of David Sharp&#x27;s party, died during his descent, and theft of gear and food from his high-altitude camp may have contributed. In addition to theft, Michael Kodas describes in his book, &quot;High Crimes: The Fate of Everest in an Age of Greed&quot; (2008): unethical guides and Sherpas, prostitution and gambling at the Tibet Base Camp, fraud related to the sale of oxygen bottles, and climbers collecting donations under the pretense of removing trash from the mountain.

The Chinese side of Everest in Tibet was described as &quot;out of control&quot; in 2007 after one Canadian had all his gear stolen and was abandoned by his Sherpa. Another Sherpa helped the victim get off the mountain safely and gave him some spare gear. Other climbers have also reported missing oxygen bottles, which can be worth hundreds of dollars each. Hundreds of climbers pass by people&#x27;s tents, making it hard to safeguard against theft. In the late 2010s, the reports of theft of oxygen bottles from camps became more common.

===Summiting with disabilities===
Summiting Everest with disabilities such as amputations and diseases has become popular in the 21st century, with stories like that of Sudarshan Gautam, a man with no arms who made it to the top in 2013. A teenager with Down syndrome made it to Base camp, which has become a substitute for more extreme record-breaking because it carries many of the same thrills including the trip to the Himalayas and rustic scenery. Danger lurks even at base camp though, which was the site where dozens were killed in the 2015 Mount Everest avalanches. Others that have climbed Everest with amputations include Mark Inglis (no legs), Hari Budha Magar (no legs), Paul Hockey (one arm only), and Arunima Sinha (one leg only).

In 2001, Erik Weihenmayer became the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest while blind.

==Aviation==
=== 1933: Flight over Everest ===
Lucy, Lady Houston, a British millionaire former showgirl, funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933. A formation of airplanes led by the Marquess of Clydesdale flew over the summit in an effort to photograph the unknown terrain.

===1988: First climb and glide===
On 26 September 1988, having climbed the mountain via the south-east ridge, Jean-Marc Boivin made the first paraglider descent of Everest, in the process creating the record for the fastest descent of the mountain and the highest paraglider flight. Boivin said: &quot;I was tired when I reached the top because I had broken much of the trail, and to run at this altitude was quite hard.&quot; Boivin ran from below the summit on 40-degree slopes to launch his paraglider, reaching Camp II at in 12 minutes (some sources say 11 minutes). Boivin would not repeat this feat, as he was killed two years later in 1990, BASE jumping off Venezuela&#x27;s Angel Falls.

===1991: Hot air balloon flyover===
In 1991, four men in two balloons achieved the first hot-air balloon flight over Mount Everest. In one balloon were Andy Elson and Eric Jones (cameraman), and in the other balloon Chris Dewhirst and Leo Dickinson (cameraman). Dickinson went on to write a book about the adventure called &quot;Ballooning Over Everest&quot;. The hot-air balloons were modified to function at up to altitude. Reinhold Messner called one of Dickinson&#x27;s panoramic views of Everest, captured on the now discontinued Kodak Kodachrome film, the &quot;best snap on Earth&quot;, according to UK newspaper &quot;The Telegraph&quot;. Dewhirst has offered to take passengers on a repeat of this feat for US$2.6 million per passenger.

===2005: Pilot summits with helicopter===
In May 2005, pilot Didier Delsalle of France landed a Eurocopter AS350 B3 helicopter on the summit of Mount Everest. He needed to land for two minutes to set the (FAI) official record, but he stayed for about four minutes, twice. In this type of landing the rotors stay engaged, which avoids relying on the snow to fully support the aircraft. The flight set rotorcraft world records, for highest of both landing and take-off.

Some press reports suggested that the report of the summit landing was a misunderstanding of a South Col landing, but he had also landed on South Col two days earlier, with this landing and the Everest records confirmed by the FAI. Delsalle also rescued two Japanese climbers at while he was there. One climber noted that the new record meant a better chance of rescue.

===2011: Paraglide off summit===
On 21 May 2011, Nepalis Lakpa Tsheri Sherpa and Sano Bapu Sunuwar paraglided from Everest&#x27;s summit to Namche Bazaar in 42 minutes. After the flight they hiked, biked, and kayaked to the Indian Ocean, reaching the Bay of Bengal by 27 June 2011, thereby becoming the first persons to complete a continuous summit-to-sea descent from Everest. They accomplished the ground-breaking feat despite Bapu having never previously climbed, and Lakpa having never kayaked and not even knowing how to swim. The duo subsequently won National Geographic Adventurers of the Year for 2012 for their exploits. In 2013 footage of the flight was shown on the television news program &quot;Nightline&quot;.

===2014: Helicopter-assisted ascent===
In 2014, a team financed and led by mountaineer Wang Jing used a helicopter to fly from South base camp to Camp II to avoid the Khumbu Icefall, and thence climbed to the Everest summit. This climb immediately sparked outrage and controversy in much of the mountaineering world over the legitimacy and propriety of her climb. Nepal ended up investigating Wang, who initially denied the claim that she had flown to Camp II, admitting only that some support crew were flown to that higher camp, over the Khumbu Icefall. In August 2014, however, she stated that she had flown to Camp II because the icefall was impassable. &quot;If you don&#x27;t fly to Camp II, you just go home&quot;, she said in an interview. In that same interview, she also insisted that she had never tried to hide this fact.

Her team had had to use the south side because the Chinese had denied them a permit to climb. Ultimately, the Chinese refusal may have been beneficial to Nepal&#x27;s interests, allowing the government to showcase improved local hospitals and providing the opportunity for a new hybrid aviation/mountaineering style, triggering discussions about helicopter use in the mountaineering world. National Geographic noted that a village festooned Wang with honours after she donated US$30,000 to the town&#x27;s hospital. Wang won the International Mountaineer of the Year Award from the Nepal government in June 2014.

===2016: Helicopter business increases===
In 2016 the increased use of helicopters was noted for increased efficiency and for hauling material over the deadly Khumbu icefall. In particular it was noted that flights saved icefall porters 80 trips but still increased commercial activity at Everest. After many Nepalis died in the icefall in 2014, the government had wanted helicopters to handle more transportation to Camp 1 but this was not possible because of the 2015 earthquake closing the mountain, so this was then implemented in 2016 (helicopters did prove instrumental in rescuing many people in 2015 though). That summer Bell tested the 412EPI, which conducted a series of tests including hovering at and flying as high as altitude near Mount Everest.

==Extreme sports==

Mount Everest has been host to other winter sports and adventuring besides mountaineering, including snowboarding, skiing, paragliding, and BASE jumping.

Yuichiro Miura became the first man to ski down Everest in the 1970s. He descended nearly from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries. Stefan Gatt and Marco Siffredi snowboarded Mount Everest in 2001. Other Everest skiers include Davo Karničar of Slovenia, who completed a top to south base camp descent in 2000, Hans Kammerlander of Italy in 1996 on the north side, and Kit DesLauriers of the United States in 2006. In 2006 Swede Tomas Olsson and Norwegian Tormod Granheim skied together down the north face. Olsson&#x27;s anchor broke while they were rappelling down a cliff in the Norton couloir at about 8,500 metres, resulting in his death from a two and a half-kilometre fall. Granheim skied down to camp III. Also, Marco Siffredi died in 2002 on his second snow-boarding expedition.

Various types of gliding descents have slowly become more popular, and are noted for their rapid descents to lower camps. In 1986 Steve McKinney led an expedition to Mount Everest, during which he became the first person to fly a hang-glider off the mountain. Frenchman Jean-Marc Boivin made the first paraglider descent of Everest in September 1988, descending in minutes from the south-east ridge to a lower camp. In 2011, two Nepalis made a gliding descent from the Everest summit down in 45 minutes. On 5 May 2013, the beverage company Red Bull sponsored Valery Rozov, who successfully BASE jumped off of the mountain while wearing a wingsuit, setting a record for world&#x27;s highest BASE jump in the process.

==Religious significance==
The southern part of Mount Everest is regarded as one of several &quot;hidden valleys&quot; of refuge designated by Padmasambhava, a ninth-century &quot;lotus-born&quot; Buddhist saint.

Near the base of the north side of Everest lies Rongbuk Monastery, which has been called the &quot;sacred threshold to Mount Everest, with the most dramatic views of the world.&quot; For Sherpas living on the slopes of Everest in the Khumbu region of Nepal, Rongbuk Monastery is an important pilgrimage site, accessed in a few days of travel across the Himalayas through Nangpa La.

Miyolangsangma, a Tibetan Buddhist &quot;Goddess of Inexhaustible Giving&quot;, is believed to have lived at the top of Mount Everest. According to Sherpa Buddhist monks, Mount Everest is Miyolangsangma&#x27;s palace and playground, and all climbers are only partially welcome guests, having arrived without invitation.

The Sherpa people also believe that Mount Everest and its flanks are blessed with spiritual energy, and one should show reverence when passing through this sacred landscape. Here, the karmic effects of one&#x27;s actions are magnified, and impure thoughts are best avoided.

== Waste management ==
In 2015, the president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association warned that pollution, especially human waste, has reached critical levels. As much as of human excrement each season is left behind on the mountain. Human waste is strewn across the verges of the route to the summit, making the four sleeping areas on the route up Everest&#x27;s south side minefields of human excrement. Climbers above Base Camp—for the 62-year history of climbing on the mountain—have most commonly either buried their excrement in holes they dug by hand in the snow, or slung it into crevasses, or simply defecated wherever convenient, often within metres of their tents. The only place where climbers can defecate without worrying about contaminating the mountain is Base Camp. At approximately , Base Camp sees the most activity of all camps on Everest because climbers acclimate and rest there. In the late-1990s, expeditions began using toilets that they fashioned from blue plastic barrels fitted with a toilet seat and enclosed.

The problem of human waste is compounded by the presence of more anodyne waste: spent oxygen tanks, abandoned tents, empty cans and bottles. The Nepali government now requires each climber to pack out eight kilograms of waste when descending the mountain.

In February 2019, due to the mounting waste problem, China closed the base camp on its side of Everest to visitors without climbing permits. Tourists are allowed to go as far as the Rongbuk Monastery.

In April 2019, the Solukhumbu district&#x27;s Khumbu Pasanglhamu Rural Municipality launched a campaign to collect nearly 10,000 kg of garbage from Everest. Five years later, 2024, waste removal is receiving continuing attention.
