<text>Native American trade refers to trade among the Indigenous people of North America and with European settlers. Trade with Europeans began before the colonial period, continuing through the 19th century and declining around 1937.

The term Native American Trade in this context describes the people involved in the trade. The products involved varied by region and era. In most of Canada, the term is synonymous with the fur trade, since fur for making beaver hats was by far the most valuable product of the trade, from the European point of view. Demand for other products resulted in trade in those items: Europeans asked for deerskin on the southeast coast of the United States, buffalo skins and meat, and pemmican on the Great Plains. In turn, Native American demand influenced the trade of goods brought by Europeans.

Economic contact between Native Americans and European colonists began in the early stages of European settlement. From the 17th century to the 19th century, the English and French mainly traded for animal pelts and fur with Native Americans. In the late 1700s, Spanish explorers started settling in southern California and initiated the establishment of missions. These missions served as focal points for interactions between Native Americans and Spanish settlers, encompassing cultural exchanges, political negotiations, trade activities, and economic developments. Evidence of these exchanges and developments were kept by the Spanish who maintained detailed ledgers documenting items that were traded in Santa Barbara between them and the Chumash that lived in the missions. Eventually, wars, the dwindling of Native American populations, and the westward expansion of the United States led to the confinement of tribes to reservations and the end of this kind of economic relations between Indians and European Americans.

Other economic relations continued, especially in the alcohol trade around many reservations, and for Native American arts and crafts that are now shown for everyone to see. Today, many Native Americans satisfy a different kind of demand with the associated trades of their gaming casinos on reservations. These have been developed as entertainment and conference resorts, serving a wide market of customers, and generating very little revenues for tribes to use for economic development, as well as welfare and education of their people.

The first explorers to conduct trade with Native Americans were Giovanni da Verrazzano and Jacques Cartier in the 1520s–1540s. Verrazzano noted in his book, &quot;If we wanted to trade with them for some of their things, they would come to the seashore on some rocks where the breakers were most violent while we remained on the little boat, and they sent us what they wanted to give on a rope, continually shouting to us not to approach the land.&quot; As visits from Europeans became more frequent and some Europeans began to settle in North America, Natives began to establish regular trade relations with these new colonists. The ideal locations for fur trading were near harbors where ships could come in.

==Trade between Native tribes==
During the pre-Columbian era, Native American tribes often traded between themselves and outside bands. Throughout the Americas, Native American tribes had been trading for thousands of years using different material goods and/or currency.

===Shell beads===
Shell beads (also referred to as shell money) have been used for around 9,000–10,000 years in the Americas, both pre-contact and post-contact. It was most commonly used as a form of trade, either as a material to be exchanged, or as a form of currency.

The &quot;Olivella biplicata&quot;, or the purple olive shell was used during the early Holocene period, around 200–1835 CE, spanning around 1,500 years. Typically used by the Chumash (located in the central and southern coastal regions of California), it was crafted and shaped into 160 different variations of shell beads, which were used as a form of currency and status. Some examples of these variant styles include; needle-drilled disks, lipped beads, cupped beads, thin rectangles (pendant), thin rectangles (sequin). Made in the Santa Barbara Channel, they were distributed throughout Chumash territory and was used throughout different areas as currency, allowing for trade between different bands, making its way up California, the Great Basin, and in Western North America.

The Cahuilla (located in Palm springs) used beads traded from the Serrano (who had received them from the Gabrieleno/Tongva) to create their own form of shell bead currency. Specific lengths were assigned for different amounts of money. An example of this is a &quot;witchu&quot;, a string of shell beads from the forehead to the ground, then multiplied by 4 equal to 50 United States cents. Another example is  the &quot;napanaa&quot;, measured by wrapping around the wrists and fingers, equal to 20 cents.

===Basketry===
Trade played a central role in spreading basket designs among California tribes through active exchange networks involving ceremonial events, visits, and intermarriages. This facilitated the advertising of design styles across neighboring communities, resulting in highly similar systems among tribes in close proximity. This uniformity in basket weaving shows a strong trade network, contrasting with the variability observed in tribes like the Pomo, who lived in more isolated communities in northern California. However, tribes such as the Yurok, Karuk, and Hupa, located along the northwestern California coast and in the Klamath Mountains, exhibited nearly identical basketry.

The intertribal commerce of Native American tribes across California and adjacent regions was characterized by the exchange of baskets as valuable commodities. Tribes engaged in the exchange of baskets to obtain goods, forge alliances, and foster social connections. For instance, the Yokuts tribes, located in the Central Valley and Sierra Nevada foothills, engaged in extensive trade networks with neighboring tribes such as Miwok, Coast Miwok, and Tubatulabal. Similarly, the Salinan people, residing along the Central Coast of California, participated in basket trade with the Yokuts and Chumash tribes  from the coastal regions. Tribes engaged in trade also obtained a variety of goods in return. These included natural resources such as obsidian, fish, salt, acorns, pine nuts, and manzanita berries.

Maidu baskets originate primarily from northeastern California, the native territory of the Maidu people. The Maidu are indigenous to the Sierra Nevada foothills and adjacent valleys, including areas such as the Sacramento Valley, the northern Sierra Nevada, and the Cascade Range. The Maidu had access to a variety of natural resources, influencing the materials used in their basketry. These baskets are crafted using traditional techniques passed down through generations and are made from locally sourced materials such as willow, maple, redbud, and ferns, abundant in the surrounding forests and valleys. Maidu&#x27;s skill in crafting high-quality baskets made them desirable trade partners, attracting interest from other tribes seeking their goods. Additionally, engaging in trade allowed the Maidu to acquire resources not readily available in their own territory. Trade served as a means of fostering alliances and maintaining social connections with neighboring groups, contributing to the cohesion and stability of the region. Through trade, the Maidu could also access items of ceremonial significance or prestige, enhancing their cultural practices and status within the broader network of Native American tribes in the region.

===Fur trade in California===
Rabbit skin blankets were a textile category that was often traded among California groups. Great Basin and other desert groups fringing California, with a good supply of hares and cottontails, were important sources for trade. The Surprise Valley Northern Paiute traded them to the Central and Southern Miwok but also received them, especially from the Tübatulabal.

==Great Plains trading networks==
The trading networks encountered by the first Europeans on the Great Plains were built on a number of trading centers acting as hubs in an advanced system of exchange over great distances. The primary centers were found at the villages of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara, with a surplus of agricultural produce that could be exchanged. Secondary centers were found at the villages of the Pawnee, Kansa, and Osage on the central great plains, and at the Caddo villages on the southern plains. The &quot;Dakota rendezvous&quot; was an important annual trading fair among the Sioux. European demand for fur changed the relations of the plains, increased the occurrence of war, and displaced several Indian nations that were forced away by the Sioux coming from the east. On the northern plains, European trade lay in the hands of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, although most of the territory belonged to France, and later Spain. European trade on the central plains was controlled by French merchants, first from New Orleans, later from St. Louis. From the mid-1700s, the Comanche became an increasingly important military and commercial factor on the southern plains, forcing the Apaches into the mountains, and exchanging goods and spoils with the Southwestern trading networks hubs in New Mexico.

==Trade with early European settlers==

===Plymouth and Jamestown===
To set up a thriving colony, settlers in the New World needed the five factors of production that contribute to the creation of wealth: land (natural resources), labor, capital, entrepreneurship, and knowledge. Often, trading with Native Americans resulted in colonists gaining needed knowledge and natural resources. Examples of this can be seen in the English settlements of Plymouth Bay and Jamestown. Massasoit, a sachem of the Wampanoag people, and Squanto, a Patuxet who acted as a diplomat, helped the Pilgrims of Plymouth Bay establish their colony by teaching them skills in cultivating this land and hunting. In return for weapons and tools, these Native Americans provided the colonists with important natural resources, including food. In 1621, Massasoit established one of the earliest trading pacts between Europeans and Natives by signing a treaty with the Plymouth Colony to engage in peaceful trade. However, as the colonial population in New England began to increase, the Wampanoag became uneasy about being displaced by the colonists. Gradually, tensions escalated, leading to King Philip&#x27;s War, an armed conflict between the Pilgrims and the Native Americans in the area. The war ended with the defeat of the Native tribe, causing a serious fracture amongst relations between the Pilgrims and Native Americans.

Relations between settlers in the Jamestown area and Native Americans ended similarly. Initially, the Powhatan aided the English settlers with food and clothing, helping them survive the early difficult years. However, relations between the two groups deteriorated after three years, resulting in a war.

===Fur trading posts===
Fur trading was one of the main economic activities in Northern America from the late 16th century to the mid-19th century. At the time, the demand for fur was surging in Europe as it was used to make cloth and fancy hats. Data collected from England in the 18th century highlights that the years from 1746 to 1763 saw an increase of 12 shillings per pelt. It has been calculated that over 20 million beaver hats were exported from England alone from 1700 to 1770. Both trading partners, Native Americans, and Europeans, provided the other a comparative advantage in the fur trade industry. The opportunity cost of hunting beavers in Europe was extremely high: by the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Eurasian beaver was near extinction in England and France. On the other hand, traders and trappers thought the wildlife in the New World was essentially limitless. Native Americans made use of the trade goods received, particularly knives, axes, and guns. The fur trade provided a stable source of income for many Native Americans until the mid-19th century when changing fashion trends in Europe and a decline in the beaver population in North America brought about a collapse in demand for fur.

===Obsidian===
Archeological evidence from missions in northern California conclude that Native Americans rerouted obsidian exchange networks through Spanish missions such as Mission San José which existed from 1797 into the 1840s. Mission San José was located in Ohlone territory, where stone tool technologies were prevalent. Despite the constraints of colonialism, Native Americans who lived at the mission were able to trade obsidian through direct geological sources such as the Cascade Range in modern-day northern California and Oregon or through evolving trade networks, which involved interactions with other tribes, as well as the Spaniards.

===Trade with the Spaniards===
Trading between Spanish settlers and Native Americans was rare and occurred in parts of New Mexico and California. The Spaniards mainly intended to spread the Christian faith to Natives and to establish the encomienda system. The most significant effect of trading with the Spanish was the introduction of the horse to the Ute in New Mexico. Gradually, horses bred and their use was adopted across the Great Plains, dramatically altering the lifestyles and customs of many Native American tribes. Many Natives switched from a hunter-gatherer economy to a nomadic lifestyle after they began using horses for transportation. They had a greater range for hunting bison and trading with other tribes. Native Americans used obsidian for thousands of years pre-contact with Europeans. As Native Americans began to settle at centralized mission establishments, they brought in obsidian items such as projectile points. The maintenance of resources such as obsidian originated from far distances such as Napa Valley, CA indicates that indigenous stone tools were traded with people at Spanish missions.

===Ceramic trade within Spanish missions===
The majority of imported ceramics arrived in Alta California, via annual supply ships from the Naval Department of San Blas. San Blas was established in 1768 for the express purpose of facilitating the Manila galleon trade and serving as a supply depot for colonial settlements in Alta California. Local ceramics were produced within each mission community rather than vessels obtained in trade from autonomous Indigenous potters. The San Diego presidio, table service at the four missions San Carlos, San Antonio, San Juan Bautista, and Santa Clara likely included both locally produced wares and imported wares because several typical tableware forms such as cups and plates are not present in ware assemblages.

===Relationship between Europeans and Natives===
It took time for Europeans and Native Americans to learn the customs of the other side. When Europeans first encountered a tribe, they would often be offered fur, food, or other items as gifts. The Europeans did not understand they were supposed to take on an alliance with the natives, including helping them against their enemies. Native American tribes regularly practice gift-giving as part of their social relations. Because the Europeans did not (or most of them), they were considered to be rude, and savage.

After observing that Europeans wanted to trade goods for the skins and other items, Native Americans entered into that. Both sides became involved in the conflicts of the other. In New France, Carolina, Virginia, New England, and New Netherland, the Europeans became drawn into the endemic warfare of their trading partners. As Native Americans were pressed into alliances by the Europeans for Queen Anne&#x27;s War, the Seven Years&#x27; War, the Nine Years&#x27; War, and other standing competitions among the European powers of France, Great Britain, and Spain, with whom they were dealing in North America, they felt drawn into the Europeans&#x27; endemic warfare.

==Late 18th century to present==

After the United States became independent, it enacted legislation to regulate trading with the Indians/Native Americans, under the Indian Intercourse Act, first passed on July 22, 1790. Later the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which was then part of the War Department, issued licenses to traders in the Native Territory. Under removal, the largest tribes from the Southeast and north of Ohio were moved west of the Mississippi River. By 1834, Native territory had been designated as what was then most of the United States west of the Mississippi, primarily what became Arkansas, Kansas, and Oklahoma. Territories of the upper West were still occupied by native tribes as well. Mountain men and traders from Mexico freely operated there independently of the US.

After the formation of the United States, the commerce clause of the Constitution gave Congress the power to &quot;regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Native tribes.&quot; In the 19th century, the American government passed legislation to support the relocation of tribes to reservations to extinguish their title to lands that could be sold to European Americans. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 forced tribes such as the Cherokee and the Choctaw to move out of their homelands. Resistance by Native Americans to relocate resulted in conflicts such as the Second Seminole War, that caused the deaths of 3,000 Native Americans. Forcing tribes to relocate and to adjust to isolated reservations often unsuitable for the subsistence farming they were encouraged to undertake, made many of them dependent on the U.S. government for annuities and supplies. They had difficulty trying to develop economic systems of their own.

As outlined by Kalt and Cornell in their book, &quot;What Can Tribes Do? Strategies and Institutions in American Native Economic Development&quot;, on reservations, tribes lacked access to capital, were assigned to areas with poor natural resources (or had their resources stolen or kept from their control), and did not possess skilled labor.

Today, many programs, such as the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development, exist to foster conditions that will help reservations become independent and financially stable communities. Since the late 20th century, many tribes have established gaming casinos. The most successful ones use part of the revenues for the economic development of their nations, as well as for welfare and education for all their tribal members.

<text>Meantone temperaments are musical temperaments; that is, a variety of tuning systems constructed, similarly to Pythagorean tuning, as a sequence of equal fifths, both rising and descending, scaled to remain within the same octave. But rather than using perfect fifths, consisting of frequency ratios of value formula_1, these are &quot;tempered&quot; by a suitable factor that narrows them to ratios that are slightly less than formula_1, in order to bring the major or minor thirds closer to the just intonation ratio of formula_3 or formula_4, respectively. A regular temperament is one in which all the fifths are chosen to be of the same size .

Twelve-tone [[equal temperament]] () is obtained by making all semitones the same size, with each equal to one-twelfth of an octave; i.e. with ratios . Relative to Pythagorean tuning, it narrows the perfect fifths by about 2 cents or th of a Pythagorean comma to give a frequency ratio of formula_5. This produces major thirds that are wide by about 13 cents, or th of a semitone. Twelve-tone equal temperament is almost exactly the same as syntonic comma meantone tuning (1.955 cents vs. 1.95512).

==Notable meantone temperaments==
Quarter-comma meantone, which tempers each of the twelve perfect fifths by of a syntonic comma, is the best known type of meantone temperament, and the term &quot;meantone temperament&quot; is often used to refer to it specifically. Four ascending fifths (as ) tempered by (and lowered by two octaves) produce a just major third () (with ratio ), which is one syntonic comma (or about 22 cents) narrower than the Pythagorean third that would result from four perfect fifths.

It was commonly used from the early 16th century till the early 18th, after which twelve-tone equitemperament eventually came into general use. For church organs and some other keyboard purposes, it continued to be used well into the 19th century, and is sometimes revived in early music performances today. Quarter-comma meantone can be well approximated by a division of the octave into 31 equal steps.

It proceeds in the same way as Pythagorean tuning; i.e., it takes the fundamental (say, ) and goes up by six successive fifths (always adjusting by dividing by powers of to remain within the octave above the fundamental), and similarly down, by six successive fifths (adjusting back to the octave by multiplying by However, instead of using the ratio, which gives perfect fifths, this must be divided by the fourth root of , which is the syntonic comma: the ratio of the Pythagorean third to the just major third 
. Equivalently, one can use instead of , which produces the same slightly reduced fifths. This results in the interval being a just major third , and the intermediate seconds (, ) dividing uniformly, so and are equal ratios, whose square is . The same is true of the major second sequences and .

However, there is a residual gap in quarter-comma meantone tuning between the last of the upper sequence of six fifths and the last of the lower sequence; e.g. between and if the starting point is chosen as , which, adjusted for the octave, are in the ratio of or cents. This is in the sense opposite to the Pythagorean comma (i.e. the upper end is flatter than the lower one) and nearly twice as large.

In third-comma meantone, the fifths are tempered by of a syntonic comma. It follows that three descending fifths (such as ) produce a just minor third () of ratio , which is nearly one syntonic comma wider than the minor third resulting from Pythagorean tuning of three perfect fifths. Third-comma meantone can be very well approximated by a division of the octave into 19 equal steps.

==The tone as a mean==
The name &quot;meantone temperament&quot; derives from the fact that in all such temperaments the size of the whole tone, within the diatonic scale, is somewhere between the major and minor tones (9:8 and 10:9 respectively) of just intonation, which differ from each other by a syntonic comma. In any regular system the whole tone (as ) is reached after two fifths (as ) (lowered by an octave), while the major third is reached after four fifths (lowered by two octaves). It follows that in comma meantine the whole tone is exactly half of the just major third (in cents) or, equivalently, the square root of the frequency ratio of .

Thus, one sense in which the tone is a mean is that, as a frequency ratio, it is the geometric mean of the major tone and the minor tone: 
formula_6, 
equivalent to 193.157 cents: the quarter-comma whole-tone size. However, &quot;any&quot; intermediate tone qualifies as a &quot;mean&quot; in the sense of being intermediate, and hence as a valid choice for some meantone system.

In the case of quarter-comma meantone, where the major third is made narrower by a syntonic comma, the whole tone is made half a comma narrower than the major tone of just intonation (9:8), or half a comma wider than the minor tone (10:9). This is the sense in which quarter-tone temperament is often considered &quot;the&quot; exemplary meantone temperament since, in it, the whole tone lies midway (in cents) between its possible extremes.

==History of meantone temperament and its practical implementation==
Mention of tuning systems that could possibly refer to meantone were published as early as 1496 (Gaffurius). Pietro Aron (Venice, 1523) was unmistakably discussing quarter-comma meantone. Lodovico Fogliani mentioned the quarter-comma system, but offered no discussion of it. The first mathematically precise meantone tuning descriptions are to be found in late 16th century treatises by Zarlino and de Salinas. Both these authors described the and meantone systems.
Marin Mersenne described various tuning systems in his seminal work on music theory, &quot;Harmonie universelle&quot;, including the 31 tone equitempered one, but rejected it on practical grounds.

Meantone temperaments were sometimes referred to under other names or descriptions. For example, in 1691 Huygens advocated the use of the 31 tone equitempered system as an excellent approximation for the comma meantone system, mentioning prior writings of Zarlino and Salinas, and dissenting from the negative opinion of Mersenne (1639). He made a detailed comparison of the frequency ratios in the system and the quarter-comma meantone temperament, which he referred to variously as &quot;temperament ordinaire&quot;, or &quot;the one that everyone uses&quot;. (See references cited in the article Temperament Ordinaire.)

Of course, the quarter-comma meantone system (or any other meantone system) could not have been implemented with complete accuracy until much later, since devices that could accurately measure all pitch frequencies didn&#x27;t exist until the mid-19th century. But tuners could apply the same methods that &quot;by ear&quot; tuners have always used: go up by fifths, and down by octaves, or down by fifths, and up by octaves, tempering the fifths so they are slightly smaller than the just ratio. How tuners could identify a &quot;quarter comma&quot; reliably by ear is a bit more subtle. Since this amounts to about 0.3% of the frequency which, near middle (~264 Hz), is about one hertz, they could do it by using perfect fifths as a reference and adjusting the tempered note to produce beats at this rate. However, the frequency of the beats would have to be slightly adjusted, proportionately to the frequency of the note. Alternatively the diatonic scale major thirds can be adjusted to just major thirds, of ratio , by eliminating the beats.

For 12 tone equally-tempered tuning, the fifths have to be tempered by considerably less than a (very close to a , or a ), since they must form a perfect cycle, with no gap at the end, whereas meantone tuning, as mentioned above, has a residual gap that is twice as large as the Pythagorean one, in the opposite direction.

Although meantone is best known as a tuning system associated with earlier music of the Renaissance and Baroque, there is evidence of its continuous usage as a keyboard temperament well into the 19th century.
: &quot;The mode of tuning which prevailed before the introduction of equal temperament, is called the Meantone System. It has hardly yet died out in England, for it may still be heard on a few organs in country churches. According to Don B. Yñiguez, organist of Seville Cathedral, the meantone system is generally maintained on Spanish organs, even at the present day.&quot; — G. Grove (1890)

It has had a considerable revival for early music performance in the late 20th century and in newly composed works specifically demanding meantone by some composers, such as Adams, Ligeti, and Leedy.

==Meantone temperaments==
A meantone temperament is a regular temperament, distinguished by the fact that the correction factor to the Pythagorean perfect fifths, given usually as a specific fraction of the syntonic comma, is chosen to make the whole tone intervals equal, as closely as possible, to the geometric mean of the major tone and the minor tone. Historically, commonly used meantone temperaments, discussed below, occupy a narrow portion of this tuning continuum, with fifths ranging from approximately 695 to 699 cents.

Meantone temperaments can be specified in various ways: By what fraction of a syntonic comma the fifth is being flattened (as above), the width of the tempered perfect fifth in cents, or the ratio of the whole tone (in cents) to the diatonic semitone. This last ratio was termed by American composer, pianist and theoretician Easley Blackwood. If happens to be a rational number = formula_7, then formula_8 is the closest approximation to the corresponding meantone tempered fifth within the equitempered division of the octave into formula_9 equal parts. Such divisions of the octave into a number of small parts greater than 12 are sometimes refererred to as microtonality, and the smallest intervals called microtones.

In these terms, some historically notable meantone tunings are listed below, and compared with the closest equitempered microtonal tuning. The first column gives the fraction of the systonic comma by which the perfect fifths are tempered in the meantone system. The second lists 5-limit rational intervals that occur within this tuning. The third gives the fraction of an octave, within the corresponding equitempered microinterval system, that best approximates the meantone fifth. The fourth gives the difference between the two, in cents. The fifth is the corresponding value of the fraction = formula_10, and the fifth is the number formula_11 of equitempered ( ) microtones in an octave.

===Equal temperaments===

In neither the twelve tone equitemperament nor the quarter-comma meantone is the fifth a rational fraction of the octave, but several tunings exist which approximate the fifth by such an interval; these are a subset of the equal temperaments in which the octave is divided into some number () of equally wide intervals.

Equal temperaments that are useful as approximations to meantone tunings include (in order of increasing generator width) and The farther the tuning gets away from quarter-comma meantone, however, the less related the tuning is to harmonic ratios. This can be overcome by tempering the partials to match the tuning, which is possible, however, only on electronic synthesizers.

==Wolf intervals==

A whole number of just perfect fifths will never add up to a whole number of octaves, because is an irrational number. If a stacked-up whole number of perfect fifths is too close to the octave, then one of the intervals that is enharmonically equivalent to a fifth must have a different width than the other fifths. For example, to make a 12 note chromatic scale in Pythagorean tuning close at the octave, one of the fifth intervals must be lowered (&quot;out-of-tune&quot;) by the Pythagorean comma; this altered fifth is called a &quot;wolf fifth&quot; because it sounds similar to a fifth in its interval size and seems like an out-of-tune fifth, but is actually a diminished sixth (e.g. between and ). Likewise, 11 of the 12 perfect fourths are also in tune, but the remaining fourth is an augmented third (rather than a true fourth).

Wolf intervals are an artifact of keyboard design, and keyboard players using a key that is actually in-tune with a different pitch than intended.
This can be shown most easily using an isomorphic keyboard, such as that shown in Figure 2.

On an isomorphic keyboard, any given musical interval has the same shape wherever it appears, except at the edges. Here&#x27;s an example. On the keyboard shown in figure 2, from any given note, the note that&#x27;s a perfect fifth higher is always upward-and-rightward adjacent to the given note. There are no wolf intervals within the note-span of this keyboard. The problem is at the edge, on the note . The note that&#x27;s a perfect fifth higher than is , which is not included on the keyboard shown (although it could be included in a larger keyboard, placed just to the right of , hence maintaining the keyboard&#x27;s consistent note-pattern). Because there is no button, when playing an power chord (open fifth chord), one must choose some other note, such as , to play instead of the missing .

Even edge conditions produce wolf intervals only if the isomorphic keyboard has fewer buttons per octave than the tuning has enharmonically-distinct notes (). For example, the isomorphic keyboard in figure 2 has 19 buttons per octave, so the above-cited edge-condition, from to , is &quot;not&quot; a wolf interval in 12 tone equal temperament (), 17 , or 19 ; however, it &quot;is&quot; a wolf interval in 26 , 31 , and 50 ET. In these latter tunings, using electronic transposition could keep the current key&#x27;s notes on the isomorphic keyboard&#x27;s white buttons, such that these wolf intervals would very rarely be encountered in tonal music, despite modulation to exotic keys.

Isomorphic keyboards expose the invariant properties of the meantone tunings of the syntonic temperament isomorphically (that is, for example, by exposing a given interval with a single consistent inter-button shape in every octave, key, and tuning) because both the isomorphic keyboard and temperament are two-dimensional (&quot;i.e.&quot;, rank 2) entities (). One-dimensional keyboards (where is some number) can expose accurately the invariant properties of only a single one-dimensional tuning in hence, the one-dimensional piano-style keyboard, with 12 keys per octave, can expose the invariant properties of only one tuning: 12 .

When the perfect fifth is exactly 700 cents wide (that is, tempered by approximately of a syntonic comma, or exactly of a Pythagorean comma) then the tuning is identical to the familiar 12 tone equal temperament. This appears in the table above when 

Because of the compromises (and wolf intervals) forced on meantone tunings by the one-dimensional piano-style keyboard, well temperaments and eventually equal temperament became more popular.

Using standard interval names, twelve fifths equal six octaves plus one augmented seventh; seven octaves are equal to eleven fifths plus one diminished sixth. Given this, three &quot;minor thirds&quot; are actually augmented seconds (for example, to ), and four &quot;major thirds&quot; are actually diminished fourths (for example, to ). Several triads (like and ) contain both these intervals and have normal fifths.

==Extended meantones==

All meantone tunings fall into the valid tuning range of the syntonic temperament, so all meantone tunings are syntonic tunings. All syntonic tunings, including the meantones and the various just intonations, conceivably have an infinite number of notes in each octave, that is, seven natural notes, seven sharp notes ( to ), seven flat notes ( to ) (which is the limit of the orchestral harp, which allows 21 pitches in an octave); then double sharp notes, double flat notes, triple sharps and flats, and so on. In fact, double sharps and flats are uncommon, but still needed; triple sharps and flats are almost never seen. In any syntonic tuning that happens to divide the octave into a small number of equally wide smallest intervals (such as 12, 19, or 31), this infinity of notes still exists, although some notes will be equivalent. For example, in 19 ET, and are the same pitch; and in just intonation for C major, are within 8.1 ¢, and so can be tempered to be identical.

Many musical instruments are capable of very fine distinctions of pitch, such as the human voice, the trombone, unfretted strings such as the violin, and lutes with tied frets. These instruments are well-suited to the use of meantone tunings.

On the other hand, the piano keyboard has only twelve physical note-controlling devices per octave, making it poorly suited to any tunings other than 12 ET. Almost all of the historic problems with the meantone temperament are caused by the attempt to map meantone&#x27;s infinite number of notes per octave to a finite number of piano keys. This is, for example, the source of the &quot;wolf fifth&quot; discussed above. When choosing which notes to map to the piano&#x27;s black keys, it is convenient to choose those notes that are common to a small number of closely related keys, but this will only work up to the edge of the octave; when wrapping around to the next octave, one must use a &quot;wolf fifth&quot; that is not as wide as the others, as discussed above.

The existence of the &quot;wolf fifth&quot; is one of the reasons why, before the introduction of well temperament, instrumental music generally stayed in a number of &quot;safe&quot; tonalities that did not involve the &quot;wolf fifth&quot; (which was generally put between and ).

Throughout the Renaissance and Enlightenment, theorists as varied as Nicola Vicentino, Francisco de Salinas, Fabio Colonna, Marin Mersenne, Christiaan Huygens, and Isaac Newton advocated the use of meantone tunings that were extended beyond the keyboard&#x27;s twelve notes, and hence have come to be called &quot;extended&quot; meantone tunings. These efforts required a corresponding extension of keyboard instruments to offer means of controlling more than 12 notes per octave, including Vincento&#x27;s Archicembalo, Mersenne&#x27;s 19 ET harpsichord, Colonna&#x27;s 31 ET sambuca, and Huygens&#x27;s 31 ET harpsichord.
Other instruments extended the keyboard by only a few notes. Some period harpsichords and organs have split / keys, such that both E major / C minor (4 sharps) and E major / C minor (3 flats) can be played with no wolf fifths. Many of those instruments also have split / keys, and a few have all the five accidental keys split.

All of these alternative instruments were &quot;complicated&quot; and &quot;cumbersome&quot; (), due to
: (a) not being isomorphic, and
: (b) not having a transposing mechanism,
which can significantly reduce the number of note-controlling buttons needed on an isomorphic keyboard (). Both of these criticisms could be addressed by electronic isomorphic keyboard instruments (such as the open-source hardware jammer keyboard), which could be simpler, less cumbersome, and more expressive than existing keyboard instruments.

<doc id="42904" wikidata="Q38807" url="?curid=42904" title="Suva">
<text>Suva (; ) is the capital and the most populous city of Fiji. It is the home of the country&#x27;s largest metropolitan area and serves as its major port. The city is located on the southeast coast of the island of Viti Levu, in Rewa Province, Central Division.

In 1877, the capital of Fiji was moved to Suva from Levuka, the main European colonial settlement at the time, due to the restrictive geography and environs of the latter. The administration of the colony was transferred from Levuka to Suva in 1882.

As of the 2017 census, the city of Suva had a population of 93,970, and Suva&#x27;s metropolitan area, which includes its independent suburbs, had a population of 185,913. The combined urban population of Suva and the towns of Lami, Nasinu, and Nausori that border it was around 330,000: over a third of the nation&#x27;s population (This urban complex, excluding Lami, is also known as the Suva-Nausori corridor).

Suva is the political, economic, and cultural centre of Fiji. It is also the economic and cultural capital of the South Pacific, hosting the majority of the regional headquarters of major international corporations, international agencies, and diplomatic missions. The city also has a thriving arts and performance scene, and a growing reputation as the region&#x27;s fashion capital.

==History==
In 1868, when Suva was still a small village, the Bauan chieftain, Seru Epenisa Cakobau, granted of land to the Australian-based Polynesia Company, in exchange for the company&#x27;s promise to pay off debts owed to the United States. More than a tenth of this land area, , was located near Suva. The company&#x27;s original intention was to develop a cotton farming industry, but the land and climate proved unsuitable. 

In 1874, control of the Fiji Islands was ceded to the United Kingdom. In 1877, the colonial authorities decided to move the capital to Suva from Levuka, Ovalau, Lomaiviti, because Levuka&#x27;s location between a steep mountain and the sea made any expansion of the town impractical. Colonel F. E. Pratt of the Royal Engineers was appointed Surveyor-General in 1875 and designed the new capital in Suva, assisted by W. Stephens and Colonel R. W. Stewart. The transfer of the administration to Suva was made official in 1882.

In 1910, Suva acquired the status of a municipality, under the Municipal Constitution Ordinance of 1909. Its area remained one square mile until 1952 when Suva annexed the Muanikau and Samabula wards, expanding its territory to . In October of that year, Suva was officially designated a city – Fiji&#x27;s first. Suva later annexed Tamavua. Most recently, Suva further extended its boundaries by incorporating the Cunningham area at its northern edge. Since then, urban sprawl has led to the growth of a number of suburbs that remain outside the city limits. Together with the city, they form the metropolitan area known as the Greater Suva Area.

Suva hosted the South Pacific Games in 2003 for the third time in the event&#x27;s 40-year history. In preparation for hosting the event, the Fijian government, with the help of a $16 million aid package from the People&#x27;s Republic of China, funded the construction of a new gymnasium, indoor sports centre, swimming pool, stadium, field hockey pitch, and grandstands in the area around Suva.

==Geography and physical characteristics==

In addition to being the capital of Fiji, Suva is also its commercial and political centre (though not necessarily its cultural centre), and its main port city. It has a mix of modern buildings and colonial-period architecture. 

Suva is located around a harbour on a hilly peninsula in the southeast corner of Viti Levu Island, between Laucala Bay and Suva Harbour. The mountains to its north and west catch the southeast trade winds, producing year-round moist conditions.

Although Suva is on a peninsula, and almost surrounded by sea, its coast is lined with mangroves - the nearest beach is 40 kilometres (25 mi) away, at Pacific Harbour. A significant part of the city centre, including the Parliament buildings, is built on reclaimed mangrove swampland.

===City wards===
Below is a list of the city&#x27;s five wards, beginning with the city centre, followed by the northwesternmost ward, and then in clockwise order:

# Central: city centre; mostly commercial, central business district
# Tamavua: urban; mostly residential
# Extension: semi-urban; residential
# Samabula: urban; residential, industrial, and commercial; has its own separate town centre; includes a university
# Muanikau: urban; mostly industrial and residential; includes large sporting venues, a university, and recreational areas

===Suva–Nausori Corridor===
Suva sits in the middle of a metropolitan area, sometimes known as the Suva Urban Complex, and sometimes informally known as Suva, even though it encompasses a total of four areas with their own town or city names and their own separate local governments. This conurbation stretches from Lami (immediately west of the city of Suva) along the Queens Highway, through Nasinu (immediately east of the city of Suva), to the Rewa River, along the Kings Highway, and then to Nausori across the river. To the north and northeast are the rainforest-park areas of Colo-i-Suva and Sawani, along the Princes Road, which connect at the Rewa River Bridge. This whole area (excluding Lami) is also formally referred to as the Suva–Nausori Corridor. It is the most populous area in Fiji, with over 330,000 inhabitants.

==Climate==
Suva has a tropical rainforest climate, according to the Köppen climate classification system. But because of its trade winds and occasional cyclones, it is not an equatorial climate. The city sees a copious amount of precipitation throughout the year, with no true dry season; no month has an average rainfall below . Suva averages of precipitation annually. Its driest month, July, averages . As in many other cities with a tropical rainforest climate, temperatures are relatively constant throughout the year, with an average high of about and an average low of about .

Suva has a markedly higher rainfall than Nadi or the western side of Viti Levu (known to Suva inhabitants as &quot;the burning west&quot;). The second governor of Fiji, Sir Arthur Gordon, is said to have remarked that he had never seen it rain anywhere the way it rains in Suva and that there was hardly a day without rain. The most copious rainfall is observed from November to May, while the slightly cooler months from June to October see considerably more moderate rainfall.

==Demographics==

Suva is a multiracial and multicultural city. Indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, the two principal ethnic groups of Fiji, comprise the bulk of Suva&#x27;s population, and the city is home to most of Fiji&#x27;s ethnic minority populations, which include Rotumans, Lauans, Rambians, Europeans (known as &quot;Kaivalagi&quot;), part-Europeans (of European and Fijian descent, known as “Kailoma&quot;) and Chinese, among others. The most widely spoken language is English, but Fijian, Fiji Hindi, and other languages are also spoken by their respective communities.

Suva&#x27;s inhabitants are representative of all the major indigenous Pacific groups: it is sometimes referred to as the “New York of the Pacific&quot;. The city has a reputation as a major economic centre in the region and is the site of University of the South Pacific&#x27;s main campus. This has led to an influx of Pacific migrants, who study, work, and live in the city and its boroughs. 
==Municipal government==
Suva has municipal status and, until 2009, was governed by a lord mayor and a 20-member city council. The Suva City Council was the municipal law-making body of the city of Suva, Fiji&#x27;s capital. It consisted of 20 councillors, elected for three-year terms from four multi-member constituencies, called wards. Councillors were elected by residents, landowners, and representatives of corporations owning or occupying taxable property in Suva councillors in turn elect, from among their own members, a lord mayor and deputy lord mayor, who served one-year terms and were eligible for re-election.

However, in 2009, the military-backed interim Fijian government dismissed all municipal government officials throughout Fiji and appointed special administrators to run the urban areas. , elected municipal government had not been restored. The special administrator of Suva, along with nearby Nasinu, is Chandu Umaria, a former lord mayor of Suva.

==Landmarks==


A well-known landmark is the Suva City Carnegie Library, which was built in 1909. It is one of many colonial-period buildings in the city. 

Another landmark is Suva&#x27;s governmental building complex. It sits on what was once the flowing waters of a creek. In 1935, the creek was drained, and the complex&#x27;s foundations were created by driving more than five kilometres of reinforced concrete pilings into its bed. The foundation stone was laid in 1937, the building complex was completed in 1939, and a new wing was completed in 1967. However, in 1992, the seat of Fiji&#x27;s parliament was moved out of that complex and into a new one on Ratu Sukuna Road.

Government House was formerly the residence of Fiji&#x27;s colonial governors and, after Fijian independence in 1970, governors-general. Today, it is the official residence of Fiji&#x27;s president. The original house on the site was built in 1882, but a fire caused by a lightning strike destroyed it in 1921, it was rebuilt in 1928. 

The Suva campus of the University of the South Pacific (USP) occupies what was originally a New Zealand military base. It is the largest of the many USP campuses dotted throughout the South Pacific. USP is the largest university in the Pacific Islands outside Hawaii, and its courses are internationally recognised and endorsed.

The Fiji Museum, now located in Thurston Gardens, was founded in 1904, and originally occupied the old town hall. It was moved to its present location in 1954. The museum houses the most extensive collection of Fijian artifacts in the world, and is also a research and educational institution, specialising in archaeology, the preservation of Fiji&#x27;s oral tradition, and the publication of material on Fiji&#x27;s language and culture.

Suva has about 78 parks. The new Takashi Suzuki Garden, in Apted Park at Suva Point, is a popular spot for viewing sunrise and sunset. Thurston Gardens, which opened in 1913, features flora from throughout the South Pacific. 

Suva has many shopping and retail areas, notably Cumming Street, which has been a vibrant and colourful shopping area since colonial times. The Cumming Street area features original colonial buildings and narrow roads. Suva also has modern shopping malls, such as the Suva Central Shopping Mall, the Mid-City Mall, and MHCC, along with other developments give much of the city a modern and sophisticated look.

TappooCity is one of Fiji&#x27;s shopping mall, and the largest in the South Pacific outside of Australia and New Zealand. This low-rise (six-storey) building was constructed in December 2009 in a joint venture by FNPF and the Tappoo Group of Companies. It is valued at US$25.7 million (FJD50 million). 

Construction work began in January 2011 for a FJD30 -million mini-mall complex at Grantham Road, behind the Sports-City Complex and close to the Suva campus of the University of the South Pacific. It was scheduled to be completed in 2012, and to house restaurants, retail outlets, and cinemas.

==Economy==
Unlike most cities and towns in Fiji, and many around the world, Suva did not grow up around a single industry. It has gradually developed to become the largest and most sophisticated city in the Pacific Islands, and a regional hub. Fijians of Indian descent have largely shaped the economy of Fiji, contributing immensely to the growth of Suva and to its status as the economic and political capital of Fiji. Suva is the commercial center of Fiji: Most international banks have their Pacific headquarters here, including ANZ and the Westpac. In addition, most Fijian financial institutions, non-governmental organisations, and government ministries and departments are headquartered here. At one point, both Air Pacific (now Fiji Airways) and Air Fiji were headquartered in Suva.

A large part of Fiji&#x27;s international shipping, as well as the docking of international cruise ships, takes place at Suva&#x27;s Kings Wharf. This has led to the growth of Suva&#x27;s tourism industry.

The largest of Suva&#x27;s several industrial areas is Walu Bay, which is home to factories, warehouses, import-export companies, shipyards, container yards, a brewery, and many printeries. Other notable industrial areas are Vatuwaqa, Raiwaqa, and Laucala Beach.

Suva boasts many thriving markets and shopping complexes. Among the most popular areas for shopping and commerce are Cumming Street and Victoria Parade.

<text>North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD ; , CDAAN), known until March 1981 as the North American Air Defense Command, is a combined organization of the United States and Canada that provides aerospace warning, air sovereignty, and protection for Canada and the continental United States. 

Headquarters for NORAD and the NORAD/United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) center are located at Peterson Space Force Base in El Paso County, near Colorado Springs, Colorado. The nearby Cheyenne Mountain Complex has the Alternate Command Center. The NORAD commander and deputy commander are, respectively, a United States four-star general or equivalent and a Canadian lieutenant-general or equivalent.

==Command==
NORAD is headed by its commander, who is a four-star general or admiral in the United States Armed Forces. The deputy commander is a Royal Canadian Air Force lieutenant general. Prior to the 1968 unification of the Canadian Forces, the deputy commander was an RCAF air marshal.

The commander is responsible to the Government of Canada (the Crown-in-Council), through the chief of the Defence Staff, and to the Government of the United States, via the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. The commander and deputy are each subject to their respective country&#x27;s laws, policies, and directives. Per the Canadian National Defence Act, the chief of the Defence Staff relays orders from the Crown-in-Council, collectively, or guidance from the minister of national defence, alone, to the officers of the Canadian Armed Forces.

==Regions==
NORAD maintains a headquarters at Peterson Space Force Base near Colorado Springs, Colorado. The NORAD and USNORTHCOM Command Center at Peterson SFB serves as a central collection and coordination facility for a worldwide system of sensors designed to provide the commander and the leadership of Canada and the U.S. with an accurate picture of any aerospace or maritime threat. NORAD has administratively divided the North American landmass into three regions: 
*Alaska NORAD (ANR) Region – Eleventh Air Force (11 AF)
*Canadian NORAD (CANR) Region – 1 Canadian Air Division (1 Cdn Air Div)
*Continental U.S. (CONR) Region – First Air Force (1 AF/CONR-AFNORTH)

Both the CONR and CANR regions are divided into eastern and western sectors.

===Alaskan===
The Alaskan NORAD Region (ANR) maintains continuous capability to detect, validate and warn off any atmospheric threat in its area of operations from its Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC) at Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson, Alaska.

ANR maintains the readiness to conduct a continuum of aerospace control missions, which include daily air sovereignty in peacetime, contingency and deterrence in time of tension, and active air defense against manned and unmanned air-breathing atmospheric vehicles in times of crisis.

ANR is supported by both active duty and reserve units. Active duty forces are provided by 11 AF and the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), and reserve forces provided by the Alaska Air National Guard. Both 11 AF and the CAF provide active duty personnel to the ROCC to maintain continuous surveillance of Alaskan airspace.

===Canadian===
Canadian NORAD Region Headquarters is at CFB Winnipeg, Manitoba. It was established on 22 April 1983. It is responsible for providing surveillance and control of Canadian airspace. The Royal Canadian Air Force provides alert assets to NORAD. CANR is divided into two sectors, the Canada East Sector and Canada West Sector. Both Sector Operations Control Centers (SOCCs) are co-located at CFB North Bay, Ontario. The routine operation of the SOCCs includes reporting track data, sensor status and aircraft alert status to NORAD headquarters. In 1996, CANR was renamed 1 Canadian Air Division and moved to CFB Winnipeg.

Canadian air defense forces assigned to NORAD include 409 Tactical Fighter Squadron at CFB Cold Lake, Alberta and 425 Tactical Fighter Squadron at CFB Bagotville, Quebec. All squadrons fly the McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet fighter aircraft.

To monitor for drug trafficking, the Canadian NORAD Region monitors all air traffic approaching the coast of Canada, in cooperation with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the United States drug law enforcement agencies. Any aircraft that has not filed a flight plan may be directed to land and be inspected by RCMP and Canada Border Services Agency.

===Continental U.S.===

The Continental NORAD Region (CONR) is the component of NORAD that provides airspace surveillance and control and directs air sovereignty activities for the Contiguous United States (CONUS). Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, CONR has been the lead agency for Operation Noble Eagle, an ongoing mission to protect the continental United States from airborne attacks.

CONR is the NORAD designation of the United States Air Force First Air Force/AFNORTH. Its headquarters is located at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. The First Air Force (1 AF) became responsible for the USAF air defense mission in September 1990. AFNORTH is the United States Air Force component of United States Northern Command (NORTHCOM).

1 AF/CONR-AFNORTH comprises Air National Guard Fighter Wings assigned an air defense mission to 1 AF/CONR-AFNORTH on federal orders, made up primarily of citizen Airmen. The primary weapons systems are the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft.

It plans, conducts, controls, coordinates and ensures air sovereignty and provides for the unilateral defense of the United States. A combined First Air Force command post is at Tyndall Air Force Base. The US East ROCC (Eastern Air Defense Sector), Sector Operations Control Center (SOCC) is at Rome, New York. The US West ROCC (Western Air Defense Sector) control center is at McChord Field, Washington. Both maintain continuous surveillance of CONUS airspace.

In its role as the CONUS NORAD Region, 1 AF/CONR-AFNORTH also performs counter-drug surveillance operations.

==History==
The North American Air Defense Command was recommended by the Joint Canadian–U.S. Military Group in late 1956, approved by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff in February 1957, and announced in August 1957. NORAD&#x27;s command headquarters was established on 12 September 1957 at Ent Air Force Base&#x27;s 1954 blockhouse. In 1958, Canada and the United States agreed that the NORAD commander would always be a United States officer, with a Canadian vice commander. Canada &quot;agreed the command&#x27;s primary purpose would be ... early warning and defense for the Strategic Air Command&#x27;s (SAC)&#x27;s retaliatory forces&quot;. 

In late 1958, Canada and the United States started the Continental Air Defense Integration North (CADIN) for the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment air defense network. The initial CADIN cost-sharing agreement between the two countries was signed in January 1959. Two December 1958 plans submitted by NORAD had &quot;average yearly expenditure of around five and one half billions&quot;, including &quot;cost of the accelerated Nike Zeus program&quot; and three Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) sites.
Canada&#x27;s NORAD bunker at CFB North Bay with a SAGE AN/FSQ-7 Combat Direction Central computer was constructed from 1959 to 1963. Each of the USAF&#x27;s eight smaller AN/FSQ-8 Combat Control Central systems provided NORAD with data and could command the entire United States air defense. The RCAF&#x27;s 1950 &quot;ground observer system, the Long Range Air Raid Warning System&quot;, was discontinued. In January 1959, the United States Ground Observer Corps was deactivated. 

The Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker&#x27;s planned mission was expanded in August 1960 to &quot;a hardened center from which CINCNORAD would supervise and direct operations &quot;against space attack&quot; as well as air attack&quot;. In October 1960, the Secretary of Defense assigned, &quot;operational command of all space surveillance to Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD) and operational control to North American Air Defense Command (NORAD)&quot;.

In December 1960, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) placed the Ent Air Force Base Space Detection and Tracking System (496L System with Philco 2000 Model 212 computer) &quot;under the operational control of CINCNORAD &quot;, during the Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker excavation, and the joint SAC-NORAD exercise &quot;Sky Shield II&quot;. In September 1962—&quot;Sky Shield III&quot; were conducted for mock penetration of NORAD sectors.

In 1963, NORAD command center operations moved from Ent Air Force Base to the partially underground &quot;Combined Operations Center&quot; for Aerospace Defense Command and NORAD at the Chidlaw Building. President John F. Kennedy visited &quot;NORAD headquarters&quot; after the 5 June 1963 United States Air Force Academy graduation. On 30 October 1964, &quot;NORAD began manning&quot; the Combat Operations Center in the Cheyenne Mountain Complex. 

In 1965, about 250,000 United States and Canadian personnel were involved in the operation of NORAD, On 1 January 1966, Air Force Systems Command turned the COC over to NORAD. The NORAD Cheyenne Mountain Complex was accepted on 8 February 1966.

===1968 reorganization===
United States Department of Defense realignments for the NORAD command organization began on 15 November 1968 (e.g., Army Air Defense Command (ARADCOM)). By 1972, there were eight NORAD &quot;regional areas ... for all air defense&quot;. The NORAD Cheyenne Mountain Complex Improvements Program (427M System) became operational in 1979.

===False alarms===
On at least three occasions, NORAD systems failed, such as on 9 November 1979, when a technician in NORAD loaded a test tape, but failed to switch the system status to &quot;test&quot;, causing a stream of constant false warnings to spread to two &quot;continuity of government&quot; bunkers as well as command posts worldwide. On 3 June 1980, and again on 6 June 1980, a computer communications device failure caused warning messages to sporadically flash in U.S. Air Force command posts around the world that a nuclear attack was taking place. 

During these incidents, Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) properly had their planes loaded with nuclear bombs in the air. Strategic Air Command (SAC) did not and received criticism, because they did not follow procedure, even though the SAC command knew these were almost certainly false alarms, as did PACAF. Both command posts had recently begun receiving and processing direct reports from the various radar, satellite, and other missile attack detection systems, and those direct reports simply did not match the erroneous data received from NORAD.

===1980 reorganization===
Following the 1979 Joint US-Canada Air Defense Study, the command structure for aerospace defense was changed, e.g., &quot;SAC assumed control of ballistic missile warning and space surveillance facilities&quot; on 1 December 1979 from ADCOM. The Aerospace Defense Command major command ended 31 March 1980. Its organizations in Cheyenne Mountain became the &quot;ADCOM&quot; &quot;specified&quot; command under the same commander as NORAD, e.g., HQ NORAD/ADCOM J31 manned the Space Surveillance Center. 

In 1982, a NORAD Off-site Test Facility called the Test and Development Facility (TDF) was located at Peterson AFB. The DEW Line was to be replaced with the North Warning System (NWS), the Over-the-Horizon Backscatter (OTH-B) radar was to be deployed, more advanced fighters were deployed, and E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft were planned for greater use. These recommendations were accepted by the governments in 1985. The United States Space Command was formed in September 1985 as an adjunct, but not a component of NORAD.

NORAD was renamed &quot;North American Aerospace Defense Command&quot; in March 1981.

===Post–Cold War===
In 1989, NORAD operations expanded to cover counter-drug operations, for example, tracking of small aircraft entering and operating within the United States and Canada. DEW line sites were replaced between 1986 and 1995 by the North Warning System. The Cheyenne Mountain site was upgraded, but none of the proposed OTH-B radars are currently in operation.

After the September 11 attacks, the NORAD Air Warning Center&#x27;s mission included the interior airspace of North America.

The Cheyenne Mountain Realignment was announced in July 2006, to consolidate NORAD&#x27;s day-to-day operations at Peterson Air Force Base. Cheyenne Mountain remains on &quot;warm standby&quot;, staffed with support personnel.


==In popular culture==
=== In film and television ===

The NORAD command center located under Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado is a setting of the 1983 film &quot;WarGames&quot; and the television series &quot;Jeremiah&quot; and &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. In the 2014 film &quot;Interstellar&quot;, NORAD dissolves and its headquarters is converted for NASA. The 1970 movie, is largely based on NORAD.

In season 25 episode 4 of the TV series &quot;South Park&quot;, NORAD is hacked into by Mr Mackey using late 1980s computer hardware.

=== Santa tracker ===

As a publicity move on 24 December 1955, NORAD&#x27;s predecessor, the Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD), informed the press that CONAD was tracking Santa Claus&#x27;s sleigh, adding that &quot;CONAD, Army, Navy and Marine Air Forces will continue to track and guard Santa and his sleigh on his trip to and from the U.S. against possible attack from those who do not believe in Christmas&quot;. A Christmas Eve tradition was born, known as the &quot;NORAD Tracks Santa&quot; program. Every year on Christmas Eve, &quot;NORAD Tracks Santa&quot; purports to track Santa Claus as he leaves the North Pole and delivers presents to children around the world. Today, NORAD relies on volunteers to make the program possible.

<text>The Queen of the Damned (1988) is a vampire novel by American writer Anne Rice, the third in her &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; series. It follows &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; and &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot;. This novel is a continuation of the story that ends in a cliffhanger in &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; and explores the rich history and mythology of the origin of the vampires, which dates back to Ancient Egypt.

In March 2014, a new installment of Rice&#x27;s series was announced titled &quot;Prince Lestat&quot;, which Rice&#x27;s son, novelist Christopher Rice, called &quot;a true sequel to &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot;&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Part One follows several people over the same period of several days. Several of the characters from the two previous books appear, including Armand, Daniel Molloy (the &quot;boy reporter&quot; of &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;), Marius de Romanus, Louis de Pointe du Lac, Gabrielle de Lioncourt and Santino. Each of the six chapters in Part One tells a different story about a different person or group of people. Two things unify these chapters: a series of dreams about red-haired twin sisters, and the fact that a powerful being is killing vampires around the world by means of spontaneous combustion.

Pandora and Santino rescue Marius, having answered his telepathic call for help. Marius informs his rescuers that Akasha has been awakened by Lestat de Lioncourt, or rather his rock music, for he has joined a rock band with mortals Alex, Larry and Tough Cookie. Having been awakened by Lestat&#x27;s rebellious music, Akasha destroys her husband Enkil and plots to rule the world. She is also revealed as the source of the attacks on other vampires.

Part Two takes place at Lestat&#x27;s concert. Jesse Reeves, a member of the secret Talamasca and relative of Maharet, is mortally injured while attending the concert, and is taken to be made into a vampire at Maharet&#x27;s compound in California&#x27;s Sonoma Mountains. The vampires from Part One later congregate in the compound. Meanwhile, Akasha abducts Lestat and takes him as an unwilling consort to various locations in the world, inciting women to rise up and kill the men who have oppressed them.

Part Three takes place at Maharet&#x27;s compound, where Maharet tells the story of Akasha and the red-haired twins, Maharet and Mekare, to the other characters. Also present are Mael and Khayman, who already know the story.

In Part Four, Akasha confronts the gathered vampires, explaining that she plans to kill 90 percent of the world&#x27;s human men and establish a new Eden in which women will worship Akasha as a goddess. If the assembled vampires refuse to follow her, she will destroy them. The vampires refuse, but Mekare enters and kills Akasha by severing her head and consuming her brain and heart. Amel passes into Mekare, thereby saving the lives of the remaining vampires. She becomes the new Queen of the Damned.

In Part Five, the vampires leave the compound and assemble at Armand&#x27;s island resort in Florida to recover. They eventually go their separate ways. Lestat takes Louis to see David Talbot in London. After their brief visit with Talbot they depart into the night, an incensed Louis and his angry words filling Lestat with glee.

===Origin of vampires===
&quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot; deals with the origins of vampires themselves. The mother of all vampires, Akasha, begins as a pre-Egyptian queen, in a land called Kemet (which will become Egypt), many thousands of years ago. During this time two powerful witches (twins Maharet and Mekare) live in the mountains close to Nineveh. The witches are able to communicate with invisible spirits and gain simple favors from them. During this period there is a bloodthirsty, invisible spirit known as Amel who continually asks the two witches if they need his assistance, although they prudently decline the offer. The witches&#x27; village is destroyed and they are incarcerated by the king and queen, who desire their knowledge. When the witches offend Akasha, the queen condemns the twins. Enkil then orders his chief steward (who is Khayman as a mortal man) to rape the twins in his stead, which would prove their lack of power, before the eyes of the court. Afterward the witches are cast out into the desert. While making her way back home with a pregnant Maharet, Mekare curses the king and queen secretly with Amel. Eventually Amel inflicts such torment on Akasha and Enkil that they demand advice and help from the two witches.

Unhappy with the young king&#x27;s policies, conspirators attempt to assassinate the royal couple in Khayman&#x27;s house while they are attempting to exorcise Amel, who had also been tormenting Khayman. While the king and queen lie dying, the evil spirit sees its chance to ensnare the soul of the dying queen and pulls it back into her body. The spirit combines itself with the flesh and blood of the queen, transforming her into a vampire. Akasha allows the king to drink her blood, which saves his life. In desperation, she orders Khayman to find the witches and bring them back to Egypt, hoping the twins will use their knowledge of spirits to help the couple, as they are overwhelmed by their thirst for blood. However, when the witches admit that they cannot help the monarchs, Akasha orders the mutilation of the witches: Maharet loses her eyes and Mekare her tongue. Afterward, Khayman, who had been turned into a vampire by Akasha, comes to the witches&#x27; cell and turns them too. The three flee together, but are caught by Akasha&#x27;s soldiers. Khayman escapes, but Maharet and Mekare are further punished. The witches are put into two separate coffins which are then set afloat on two separate bodies of water. They are only reunited near the end of the novel &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;.

In Mekare&#x27;s absence, Maharet returns to watch over her daughter and her descendants. Maharet&#x27;s descendants become what she calls the Great Family. A maternal line, the Great Family includes every culture, religion, ethnicity, and race. The Great Family represents all humanity and shows the vampires what Akasha would destroy with the creation of her New World Order.

As the source of all vampires, Akasha is connected to all vampires by the blood and spirit they collectively share. In an experiment by the first Keeper, Akasha and Enkil are exposed to sunlight when they are several thousand years old. This merely darkens their skin. However, the result on all other vampires is extreme, and many of the weakest vampires die, thus confirming the legend that anything that harms Akasha will also directly affect all of her progeny.

==Reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the entertaining, rich worldbuilding in the historical segments but criticized the contemporary sections for their melodramatic dialogue and cliche-riddled prose. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called the novel &quot;thin, unconvincing, and a grave disappointment&quot;. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said that excessive philosophical musings slow down the otherwise well-crafted storyline.

&quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot; made its debut at number two on The New York Times Best Seller list. It ascended to the top spot in its second week and remained on the list for a total of 17 weeks.

<doc id="42909" wikidata="Q102822" url="?curid=42909" title="Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff">
<text>Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff Jr. (; 30 August 1852 – 1 March 1911) was a Dutch physical chemist. A highly influential theoretical chemist of his time, Van &#x27;t Hoff was the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. His pioneering work helped found the modern theory of chemical affinity, chemical equilibrium, chemical kinetics, and chemical thermodynamics. In his 1874 pamphlet, Van &#x27;t Hoff formulated the theory of the tetrahedral carbon atom and laid the foundations of stereochemistry. In 1875, he predicted the correct structures of allenes and cumulenes as well as their axial chirality. He is also widely considered one of the founders of physical chemistry as the discipline is known today.

==Biography==
The third of seven children, Van &#x27;t Hoff was born in Rotterdam, Netherlands, 30 August 1852. His father was Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff Sr., a physician, and his mother was Alida Kolff van &#x27;t Hoff. From a young age, he was interested in science and nature, and frequently took part in botanical excursions. In his early school years, he showed a strong interest in poetry and philosophy. He considered Lord Byron to be his idol.

Against the wishes of his father, Van &#x27;t Hoff chose to study chemistry. First, he enrolled at Delft University of Technology in September 1869, and studied until 1871, when he passed his final exam on 8 July and obtained a degree of chemical technologist. He passed all his courses in two years, although the time assigned to study was three years. Then he enrolled at University of Leiden to study chemistry. He then studied in Bonn, Germany, with August Kekulé and in Paris with Adolphe Wurtz. He received his doctorate under Eduard Mulder at the University of Utrecht in 1874.

In 1878, Van &#x27;t Hoff married Johanna Francina Mees. They had two daughters, Johanna Francina (1880–1964) and Aleida Jacoba (1882–1971), and two sons, Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff III (1883–1943) and Govert Jacob (1889–1918). Van &#x27;t Hoff died at the age of 58, on 1 March 1911, at Steglitz, near Berlin, of tuberculosis.

==Career==
===Organic chemistry===
Van &#x27;t Hoff earned his earliest reputation in the field of organic chemistry. In 1874, he accounted for the phenomenon of optical activity by assuming that the chemical bonds between carbon atoms and their neighbors were directed towards the corners of a regular tetrahedron. This three-dimensional structure accounted for the isomers found in nature. He shares credit for this with the French chemist Joseph Le Bel, who independently came up with the same idea.

Three months before his doctoral degree was awarded, Van &#x27;t Hoff published this theory, which today is regarded as the foundation of stereochemistry, first in a Dutch pamphlet in the fall of 1874, and then in the following May in a small French book entitled &quot;La chimie dans l&#x27;espace&quot;. A German translation appeared in 1877, at a time when the only job Van &#x27;t Hoff could find was at the Veterinary School in Utrecht. In these early years his theory was largely ignored by the scientific community, and was sharply criticized by one prominent chemist, Hermann Kolbe. Kolbe wrote:
&quot;A Dr. J. H. van &#x27;t Hoff of the Veterinary School at Utrecht has no liking, apparently, for exact chemical investigation. He has considered it more convenient to mount Pegasus (apparently borrowed from the Veterinary School) and to proclaim in his &quot;‘La chimie dans l’espace’&quot; how, in his bold flight to the top of the chemical Parnassus, the atoms appeared to him to be arranged in cosmic space.&quot; However, by about 1880, support for Van &#x27;t Hoff&#x27;s theory by such important chemists as Johannes Wislicenus and Viktor Meyer brought recognition.

===Physical chemistry===
In 1884, Van &#x27;t Hoff published his research on chemical kinetics, titled &quot;Études de Dynamique chimique&quot; (&quot;Studies in Chemical Dynamics&quot;), in which he described a new method for determining the order of a reaction using graphics and applied the laws of thermodynamics to chemical equilibria. He also introduced the modern concept of chemical affinity. In 1886, he showed a similarity between the behaviour of dilute solutions and gases. In 1887, he and German chemist Wilhelm Ostwald founded an influential scientific magazine named &quot;Zeitschrift für physikalische Chemie&quot; (&quot;Journal of Physical Chemistry&quot;). He worked on Svante Arrhenius&#x27;s theory of the dissociation of electrolytes and in 1889 provided physical justification for the Arrhenius equation. In 1896, he became a professor at the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. His studies of the salt deposits at Stassfurt were an important contribution to Prussia&#x27;s chemical industry.

Van &#x27;t Hoff became a lecturer in chemistry and physics at the Veterinary College in Utrecht. He then worked as a professor of chemistry, mineralogy, and geology at the University of Amsterdam for almost 18 years before eventually becoming the chairman of the chemistry department. In 1896, van &#x27;t Hoff moved to Germany, where he finished his career at the University of Berlin in 1911. In 1901, he received the first Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work with solutions. His work showed that very dilute solutions follow mathematical laws that closely resemble the laws describing the behavior of gases.

==Honours and awards==
In 1885, Van &#x27;t Hoff was appointed as a Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1904, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society. Other distinctions include honorary doctorates from Harvard and Yale (1901), Victoria University, the University of Manchester (1903), and University of Heidelberg (1908). He was awarded the Davy Medal of the Royal Society in 1893 (along with Le Bel), and elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1897. He was awarded the Helmholtz Medal of the Prussian Academy of Sciences (1911), and appointed Knight of the French Legion of Honour (1894) and Senator in the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft (1911). Van &#x27;t Hoff became an Honorary Member of the British Chemical Society in London, the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (1892), American Chemical Society (1898), the Académie des Sciences in Paris (1905), and the Netherlands Chemical Society (1908). Of his numerous distinctions, Van &#x27;t Hoff regarded winning the first Nobel Prize in Chemistry as the culmination of his career. The following are named after him:
* Van &#x27;t Hoff factor
* Van &#x27;t Hoff equation
* Le Bel–Van &#x27;t Hoff rule
On 14 May 2021, asteroid 34978 van &#x27;t Hoff, discovered by astronomers with the Palomar–Leiden survey in 1977, was in his memory.

<text>Jakarta Server Pages (JSP; formerly JavaServer Pages) is a collection of technologies that helps software developers create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, SOAP, or other document types. Released in 1999 by Sun Microsystems, JSP is similar to PHP and ASP, but uses the Java programming language.

To deploy and run Jakarta Server Pages, a compatible web server with a servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat or Jetty, is required.

==Overview==
Architecturally, JSP may be viewed as a high-level abstraction of Jakarta Servlets. JSPs are translated into servlets at runtime, therefore JSP is a Servlet; each JSP servlet is cached and re-used until the original JSP is modified.

Jakarta Server Pages can be used independently or as the view component of a server-side model–view–controller design, normally with JavaBeans as the model and Java servlets (or a framework such as Apache Struts) as the controller. This is a type of Model 2 architecture.

JSP allows Java code and certain predefined actions to be interleaved with static web markup content, such as HTML. The resulting page is compiled and executed on the server to deliver a document. The compiled pages, as well as any dependent Java libraries, contain Java bytecode rather than machine code. Like any other .jar or Java program, code must be executed within a Java virtual machine (JVM) that interacts with the server&#x27;s host operating system to provide an abstract, platform-neutral environment.

JSPs are usually used to deliver HTML and XML documents, but through the use of OutputStream, they can deliver other types of data as well.

The Web container creates JSP implicit objects like request, response, session, application, config, page, pageContext, out and exception. JSP Engine creates these objects during translation phase.

== Syntax ==

=== Directives, scriptlets, and expressions, declaration ===

JSPs use several delimiters for scripting functions. 
The most basic is codice_1, which encloses a JSP &quot;scriptlet.&quot; A scriptlet is a fragment of Java code that runs when the user requests the page.

Other common delimiters include codice_2 for &quot;expressions,&quot; where the scriptlet and delimiters are replaced with the result of evaluating the expression, and &quot;directives&quot;, denoted with codice_3.

Java code is not required to be complete or self-contained within a single scriptlet block. It can straddle markup content, provided that the page as a whole is syntactically correct. For example, any Java &quot;if/for/while&quot; blocks opened in one scriptlet must be correctly closed in a later scriptlet for the page to successfully compile. This allows code to be intermingled and can result in poor programming practices.

Content that falls inside a split block of Java code (spanning multiple scriptlets) is subject to that code. Content inside an &quot;if&quot; block will only appear in the output when the &quot;if&quot; condition evaluates to true. Likewise, content inside a loop construct may appear multiple times in the output, depending upon how many times the loop body runs.

==== Example ====
The following would be a valid for loop in a JSP page:

&lt;p&gt;Counting to three:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;% for (int i=1; i&lt;4; i++) { %&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This number is &lt;%= i %&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK.&lt;/p&gt;

The output displayed in the user&#x27;s web browser would be:
=== Standard JSP Tags ===

==== The useBean Tag ====
The JSP codice_4 tag enables the developer to access and create a Javabean.
Although using the codice_4 tag looks similar to an HTML tag, all JSP tags for JavaBeans use XML syntax. Therefore the code containing the codice_4 tag is case-sensitive.

The codice_4 tag contains several attributes. The codice_8 attribute declares the name that is used for gaining access to the bean. The codice_9 attribute declares the package and class for the bean. The codice_10 declares the object responsible for storing the bean. The value for the scope defines the duration for which the bean is available for the rest of the java application to use. The scope can be one of the following four values: 

* The scope implies that the bean is located in the implicitly defined object, and is only available for the current page. By default, all beans have a scope of .
* The scope implies that the bean can be found in the object. This bean can be accessed by all other JSPs and servlets that have access to the current request object.
* The scope implies that the bean can be found in the object. This bean can be accessed by all other JSPs and servlets that have access to the specified object.
* The scope implies that the bean can be found in the object. This bean can be accessed by all other JSPs and servlets that have access to the specified object.

==== The getProperty and setProperty Tags ====
After a bean has been created using the codice_4 tag, the codice_12 and codice_13 tags can be used for getting and setting the properties of the bean.
The JSP codice_12 is used to get the property of created bean.
The JSP codice_13 tag is used to set the properties for a bean.
For the codice_12 and codice_13 tags, the name attribute is used to specify the bean&#x27;s name. So the name attribute must match the id attribute provided by the codice_4 tag.

=== Expression Language ===
Version 2.0 of the JSP specification added support for the Expression Language (EL), used to access data and functions in Java objects. In JSP 2.1, it was folded into the Unified Expression Language, which is also used in JavaServer Faces.

The JSP Expression Language uses a compact syntax which enables the developer to get attributes and JavaBean properties from a given request object. When using EL, a dollar sign (&quot;$&quot;) must be added at the beginning of the code. The dollar symbol is followed by an opening brace (&quot;{&quot;), as well as a closing brace (&quot;}&quot;). The code is then written between the opening and closing braces.

==== Example ====

The following is an example of EL syntax:

The value of codice_19 in the object codice_20 is codice_21.

=== Additional tags ===

The JSP syntax add additional tags, called JSP actions, to invoke built-in functionality. Additionally, the technology allows for the creation of custom JSP &quot;tag libraries&quot; that act as extensions to the standard JSP syntax. One such library is the JSTL.

==== Jakarta Standard Tag Library ====

Jakarta Standard Tag Library (JSTL) supports common tasks that must be performed in JSPs. Examples includes iteration and conditionals (the equivalent of &quot;for&quot; and &quot;if&quot; statements in Java).

Out of all the libraries in JSTL, the JSTL core library is most commonly used. A taglib directive must be used to specify the URI of the JSTL core library using a prefix. Although there are many different choices for the prefix, the &quot;c&quot; prefix is commonly used for this library.

=== XML-compliant JSP ===

JSP pages may also be written in fully valid XML syntax. Such JSP files commonly use the alternative codice_22 file extension, which usually causes the application server to validate the XML syntax.

Since the usual JSP syntax codice_23 is not valid in XML, a developer must use alternative tags provided by JSP. For example, the common codice_24 directive may instead be written as a codice_25 tag, and tag libraries are imported using XML namespaces, instead of the usual codice_26 tag.

== Compiler ==

A JavaServer Pages compiler is a program that parses JSPs and transforms them into executable Java Servlets. A program of this type is usually embedded into the application server and run automatically the first time a JSP is accessed, but pages may also be precompiled for better performance, or compiled as a part of the build process to test for errors.

Some JSP containers support configuring how often the container checks JSP file timestamps to see whether the page has changed. Typically, this timestamp would be set to a short interval (perhaps seconds) during software development, and a longer interval (perhaps minutes, or even never) for a deployed Web application.

== Criticism ==

According to Joel Murach and Michael Urban, authors of the book &quot;Murach&#x27;s Java Servlets and JSP&quot;, embedding Java code in JSP is generally bad practice. A better approach would be to migrate the back-end logic embedded in the JSP to the Java code in the . In this scenario, the is responsible for processing, and the JSP is responsible for displaying the HTML, maintaining a clear separation of concerns.

In 2000, Jason Hunter, author of &quot;Java Servlet Programming&quot; described a number of &quot;problems&quot; with JavaServer Pages. Nevertheless, he wrote that while JSP may not be the &quot;best solution for the Java Platform&quot; it was the &quot;Java solution that is most like the non-Java solution,&quot; by which he meant Microsoft&#x27;s Active Server Pages. Later, he added a note to his site saying that JSP had improved since 2000, but also cited its competitors, Apache Velocity and Tea (template language). Today, several alternatives and a number of JSP-oriented pages in larger web apps are considered to be technical debt.

The university is a member of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, International Association of Universities, Canadian Association of Research Libraries, Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate, Canadian Bureau for International Education and Canadian University Press. The university&#x27;s varsity teams, known as the Stingers, compete in the Quebec Student Sport Federation of U Sports.

==History==
The roots of Concordia University’s founding institutions go back more than 120 years with the establishment of Loyola College in 1896 and Sir George Williams University in 1926.

===Loyola College===
Loyola College traces its history to an English-language program at the Collège Sainte-Marie de Montréal (today part of the Université du Québec à Montréal) at the Jesuit Sacred Heart Convent. In 1896, Loyola College was established at the corner of Bleury Street and Saint Catherine Street, and it was named in honour of Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus. On March 10, 1898, the institution was incorporated by the Government of Quebec and became a full-fledged college. The same year, following a fire, the college was relocated further west on Drummond Street, south of Saint Catherine Street. Although founded as a &quot;collège classique&quot; (the forerunners of Quebec&#x27;s college system), Loyola began granting university degrees through Université Laval in 1903.

The college moved into the present west-end campus on Sherbrooke Street West in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce in 1916. The School of Sociology opened in 1918. Since Loyola College never became a chartered university, it did not have the ability to grant its own university degrees. In 1920, the institution became affiliated with Université de Montréal, which began granting its degrees instead of Université Laval.

Memorial bronze honour roll plaques in the entrance hall near the administrative offices are dedicated to those from Loyola College who fought in the First World War, Second World War and Korean War.

The inter-war period was marked by the shift of education in the institution, the &quot;collège classique&quot; education was replaced by humanistic education (Liberal Arts College) in 1940, and Loyola became a four-year institution. Theology and philosophy were taught to all students until 1972.

In 1940, the Faculty of Science and the Department of Engineering were created. In addition to providing the same undergraduate programs as other colleges, the institution also offered innovative fields of study at the time, such as exercise science and communication studies. Students could enrol in academic majors starting in 1953 and honours programs in 1958. Students graduating from Loyola could afterwards pursue graduate-level education in other universities, with a few earning Rhodes Scholarships.

Starting in 1958, Loyola also began offering its first evening courses for students who were not able to go to school full-time. New courses were given in library science and faith community nursing. Since its creation, Loyola College had welcomed almost exclusively young English-speaking Catholic men as students. It became co-ed in 1959 and became less homogeneous with the ever-increasing number of foreign students.

Obtaining a university charter was an important issue in the 1960s. Although many wanted Loyola College to become Loyola University, the Government of Quebec preferred to annex it to Sir George Williams University. Negotiations began in 1968 and ended with the creation of Concordia University on August 24, 1974.

===Sir George Williams University===
In 1851, the first YMCA in North America was established on Ste. Helene Street in Old Montreal. Beginning in 1873, the YMCA offered evening classes to allow working people in the English-speaking community to pursue their education while working during the day. Sixty years later, the Montreal YMCA relocated to its current location on Stanley Street in Downtown Montreal. In 1926, the education program at the YMCA was reorganized as Sir George Williams College, named after George Williams, founder of the original YMCA in London, England, upon which the Montreal YMCA was based. In 1934, Sir George Williams College offered the first undergraduate credit course in adult education in Canada.

Sir George Williams College received its university charter from the provincial government in 1948, though it remained the education arm of the Montreal YMCA. Sir George Williams expanded into its first standalone building, the Norris Building, in 1956. In 1959, the college requested that the Quebec legislature amend its university charter, changing its name to Sir George Williams University. It established a Centre for Human Relations and Community Studies in 1963. Sir George Williams continued to hold classes in the YMCA building until the construction of the Henry F. Hall Building in 1966.

The university gained international attention in 1969 for what is known as the &quot;Computer Centre Incident.&quot; Notably in spring 1968, six black West Indian students at Sir George Williams University accused a biology lecturer (later assistant professor) of racism. The complaint was lodged to the dean of students, Magnus Flynn. Dissatisfied with how the administration was handling their complaint, the students decided to make it a public issue in fall 1968. The students occupied and destroyed the Hall Building&#x27;s ninth floor computer lab after threatening to do so should the riot squad be called. The events forced the university to re-evaluate its policies, leading to the creation of the Ombuds Office and establishment of the University Regulations on Rights and Responsibilities in April 1971. (See Sir George Williams Affair).

Following several years of discussions and planning, Sir George Williams University merged with Loyola College to create Concordia University in 1974. Concordia provided students with representative student organizations and greater power over administrative decisions at the university.

===Merger===
In 1968, in the wake of the Parent Commission Report, which recommended the secularization of Quebec&#x27;s educational system, the Government of Quebec asked Loyola College and Sir George Williams University to consider some form of union. The proposed merger was discussed by the Loyola-Sir George Williams Joint Steering Committee, a committee created to analyze all forms of possible mergers of the two institutions. It was proposed, in 1969, to create a university federation that allowed students to take courses at both campuses without paying additional fees. There was also mention of a shuttle bus service linking the remote facilities apart.

Criticized for the difficulties encountered by the cohesion of the various departments and faculties, this option was set aside, but not totally rejected by the Joint Steering Committee. The Joint Committee of Representatives of the Board of Trustees of Loyola College and the Board of Governors of Sir George Williams University was formed in December 1971 and in fall 1972 produced a document outlining the basis of a university with two campuses. While the committee considered a number of possible models, including that of a loose federation, the solution finally adopted was that of an integrated institution, Concordia University, operating under the existing charter of Sir George Williams University. Following several revisions in November 1972, the document became the main plan of the proposed merger. It was accepted by both institutions, which began the process of consolidating their operations.

In early 1973, the two institutions announced the merger would take place that fall. However, legal and administrative procedures delayed the merger for another year. On August 24, 1974, the Government of Quebec recognized the merger, thus creating Concordia University. The name was taken from the motto of the city of Montreal, &quot;Concordia salus&quot; (meaning &quot;well-being through harmony&quot;).

===Post-merger===
The legal existence of Concordia dates from August 24, 1974. The integration of the various faculties of the two institutions into a coherent whole took several years. The five faculties of the new university were a combination of existing faculties and departments prior to the merger. There was a Faculty of Commerce, Faculty of Science and Faculty of Arts at Sir George Williams University. Additionally, there was a Faculty of Arts and Science at Loyola College. The Faculty of Engineering of both institutions had previously been combined.

The Faculty of Fine Arts was created in 1976.

The first phase of the combination of the Faculties of Arts and Science began in 1977 and ended in 1985.

In the late 1980s, the Georges P. Vanier Library on the Loyola Campus was enlarged, while in 1992, the library on the Sir George Williams Campus moved to the new J.W. McConnell Building. The Norris Building was closed the same year.

On August 24, 1992, Valery Fabrikant, a mechanical engineering professor, shot five colleagues, killing four, on the ninth floor of the Hall Building. Fabrikant was convicted of the murders and sentenced to life imprisonment. The university erected a memorial to the slain professors (four granite tables) in the Hall Building lobby.

Starting in 1998, the university entered a major phase of expansion to meet its growing student enrolment. In August 2003, Concordia inaugurated the Richard J. Renaud Science Complex on the Loyola Campus.

In 2005, the university launched a major urban redevelopment project in the neighbourhood surrounding the Sir George Williams Campus, known as the Quartier Concordia. That same year, the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex opened its doors on Saint Catherine Street West between Guy Street and Mackay Street.

In September 2009, the university marked the opening of the new building for the John Molson School of Business.

In September 2015, the university held a ribbon cutting for the District 3 Innovation Center&#x27;s new space on the sixth floor of Concordia&#x27;s Faubourg Building.

The university opened its interdisciplinary Applied Science Hub in 2020.

==Campuses==

The university has two campuses, set approximately 7 km (4 miles) apart: Sir George Williams Campus in the downtown core of Montreal, in an area known as Quartier Concordia (around the Guy–Concordia Metro station), and Loyola Campus in the residential west-end district of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. They are connected by free shuttle-bus service for students, faculty and staff.

===Libraries, archives and galleries===

Concordia University has three main library locations. The R. Howard Webster Library is located in the J.W. McConnell Building on the Sir George Williams Campus and the Georges P. Vanier Library is located on the Loyola Campus. On September 2, 2014, the Library opened the Grey Nuns Reading Room, a silent study space for Concordia students located in the former Chapel of the Invention of the Holy Cross. The Concordia Library houses several special and unique collections including the Azrieli Holocaust Collection and the Irving Layton Collection. Most special collections are located in the Vanier Library. The Library also maintains the university&#x27;s institutional repository, Spectrum. The Library is a member of the Canadian Association of Research Libraries. The Library also has partnerships with the Canadian Research Knowledge Network and the Data Liberation Initiative.

Concordia&#x27;s Henry F. Hall Building houses the Leonard and Bina Ellen Art Gallery. Samuel Schecter, an art enthusiast and businessman, set up two funds in 1962 to be used for the purchase of Canadian art at Sir George Williams University and at Loyola College (Montreal). When Sir George Williams University and Loyola College merged to form Concordia in 1974, their respective art collections were also combined. The collection of the Leonard and Bina Ellen Gallery consists of 1,800 paintings, sculptures, prints, photographs and videos, many of the works by 20th-century Canadian artists.

Concordia&#x27;s Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Complex houses the FOFA Gallery, a primary venue for exhibiting works by faculty, students and alumni of the Faculty of Fine Arts.

Concordia&#x27;s Visual Arts Building on René Lévesque Boulevard houses the VAV Gallery, a student-run exhibition space seeking to highlight the work of undergraduate students in the Fine Arts department.

Concordia&#x27;s Records Management and Archives stores official records of, or relating to, or people/activities connected with Concordia University and its two founding institutions. The collection consists of manuscripts, texts, photographs, audio-visual material and artifacts.

===New buildings===
In 2001, Concordia embarked on a mission to develop and expand the quality of the downtown campus, and to revive the west end in Montreal.

The university also acquired the historic Grey Nuns Mother House near its Sir George Williams Campus, for $18 million. Built in 1871, it would alone double the size of the current downtown campus. From 2007 to 2022, the university moved into the building in four separate phases. The large property will house the Faculty of Fine Arts and possibly the Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema, and other departments. Concordia Residence Life currently houses nearly 250 students each year in the Grey Nuns Building. The dorm rooms are among the largest in the country, as many of the rooms have been transformed from when the section of the Grey Nuns Building was occupied by the Grey Nuns. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2011.
The Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (EV Building) at Saint Catherine Street and Guy Street was opened in September 2005. The building is directly connected to the Guy–Concordia Metro station and also houses Le Gym, a facility of Concordia&#x27;s Department of Recreation and Athletics. Across the street, the 100-year-old TD Canada Trust building was donated to Concordia in 2005 by the Toronto-Dominion Bank.

Construction of the new John Molson Building (MB), the home of the John Molson School of Business located on the corner of Guy Street and De Maisonneuve Boulevard West, began in February 2007. At a ceremony at Concordia on October 30, 2006, the Quebec Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports, Jean-Marc Fournier, announced an investment of $60 million towards the construction of the new building. The government&#x27;s $60 million represented about half of the total construction costs. Construction started on January 22, 2006, and the building was completed and opened in September 2009. The 15-story building now houses the John Molson School&#x27;s about 9,100 full- and part-time students under the same roof for the first time. The departments of contemporary dance, theatre and music also moved into the new MB Building. It is connected to the EV Building by a tunnel under Guy Street.

In April 2010, a 120-metre tunnel completed the underground connections of the Guy-Concordia Metro station with the Henry F. Hall Building and the J.W. McConnell Building.

Concordia opened the Applied Science Hub on the Loyola Campus in December 2020. The $63.1-million state-of-the-art facility — built thanks to $36.7 million in support from the Government of Canada and the Government of Quebec — was strategically designed to enable interdisciplinary collaboration and research between faculty and students in the Faculty of Arts and Science, Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science as well as the District 3 Innovation Centre.

===Quartier Concordia===
Quartier Concordia is a neighbourhood redevelopment project centred around Concordia University&#x27;s Sir George Williams Campus in downtown Montreal. Bordered by Sherbrooke Street to the north, Saint Mathieu Street to the west, René Lévesque Boulevard to the south and Bishop Street to the east, the district is designed to be a green urban campus that will improve the use and quality of public places and spaces, student life on campus and transportation.

As part of the redesign, the small Norman Bethune Square was redesigned and enlarged. Sidewalks in the area were also widened, with additional trees.

Since 2010, a tunnel links the university&#x27;s Henry F. Hall and J.W. McConnell buildings with the Guy-Concordia Metro station. However, a project to create a green space on Mackay Street was put on hold.

==Administration and governance==

===Governance===
Concordia is led by its president and vice-chancellor (referred to as the president), provost and vice-presidents. The Board of Governors and the Senate manage the university&#x27;s affairs and academic integrity. The president and the senior leadership ensure transparency and accountability of the administration. The administration is supervised by the Board of Governors and Senate. Under the Charter of Concordia University, the university&#x27;s highest governing body is the Board of Governors, which has final authority over the affairs of the university. The Senate derives its authority from the Board of Governors.

===Academic units===

The university has four faculties — Faculty of Arts and Science, Faculty of Fine Arts, Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science and John Molson School of Business — as well as the School of Graduate Studies. The respective faculties supervise the academic departments/institutes. For example, the Faculty of Art and Science oversees the Department of Applied Human Sciences and Simone de Beauvoir Institute.

===Finances===
In the 2021–22 year, Concordia received $586.5 million in revenue. Fifty-two per cent of the university&#x27;s revenue comes from grants of the Government of Quebec, which are given based on the student population. As of 2022, the university&#x27;s foundation has $358.451 million in its endowment. In November 2017, Concordia launched the Campaign for Concordia. The campaign&#x27;s original target was $250 million, since raised to $350 million. Its goal is to support the university&#x27;s nine strategic directions that will advance Concordia&#x27;s position as &quot;Canada&#x27;s next-generation university.&quot; In January 2018, Concordia President Alan Shepard reported that the university had already reached &quot;more than halfway&quot; of its goal. As of 2023, the campaign is still ongoing.

==Academics==
Students begin their university studies in September or, in some cases, in January or May. An undergraduate degree normally requires three or four years of full-time study, a master&#x27;s one to three years, and a PhD at least four years. Diplomas and certificates usually take no longer than a year and a half to complete.

Concordia has more than 400 undergraduate programs under the Faculty of Arts and Science, the Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science, the Faculty of Fine Arts and the John Molson School of Business. Students are normally enrolled in one of these faculties but may take courses from any of the others as part of their studies. Class sizes vary from 30 to 400 students.

The School of Graduate Studies offers about 120 programs leading to master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees, and graduate diplomas and certificates for professionals seeking to upgrade their knowledge and skills.

Concordia Continuing Education offers university-level studies and training to those from diverse backgrounds and stages of life.

The Institute for Co-operative Education administers more than 70 bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s programs in an alternating co-op work-study format. Concordia&#x27;s co-op programs enable students to enrich their learning by participating in career-relevant 12–17-week full-time, paid work terms. Depending on their faculty and major, co-op students will usually graduate with a minimum of 12 months of academically relevant work experience. There are also Industrial Experience and Professional Experience options in certain disciplines that enable students to participate in a summer-only work term. Concordia is a member of the Canadian Association for Co-operative Education (CAFCE).

During the 2022–2023 academic year, there were 35,404 undergraduate students, 10,084 graduate students and 4,410 continuing education students enrolled at Concordia.

===Faculty of Arts and Science===
Concordia&#x27;s Faculty of Arts and Science consists of 21 departments and seven colleges, schools and institutes in the humanities, sciences and social sciences at the undergraduate and graduate levels. There are 257 programs, offering more than 2,400 courses. There are 869 full-time and part-time faculty members. During the 2022-23 academic year, there were 18,502 undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in the faculty.

In addition to regular academic programs, the Faculty of Arts and Science also includes three colleges, two schools and two institutes. These are the Liberal Arts College, the Loyola College for Diversity and Sustainability, the School of Community and Public Affairs, the School of Irish Studies, the Science College, the Simone de Beauvoir Institute and the Concordia Institute for Canadian Jewish Studies.

The Loyola College for Diversity and Sustainability (formerly Loyola International College) is an interdisciplinary college on the Loyola Campus, the original site of Loyola College. It offers minor programs in Diversity and the Contemporary World and Sustainability Studies.

At the undergraduate level, the Faculty of Arts and Science offers both Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Science (BSc) programs with majors ranging from economics, political science and sociology to actuarial mathematics, biology and ecology.

===Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science===
The Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science, formerly known as Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science, is named after Concordia alumna Gina Cody, who donated $15 million to the university in 2018. In response, the university renamed its faculty of engineering and computer science in her honour, making it the first engineering school to be named after a woman in Canada and globally. In 2018, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; ranked its programs as one of the best in Canada. The faculty offers more than 50 undergraduate and graduate-level programs in the following departments: Building, Civil and Environmental Engineering; Centre for Engineering in Society; Computer Science and Software Engineering; Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering; Chemical and Materials Engineering; Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechanical, Industrial and Aerospace Engineering. The engineering programs are all accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB). During the 2022-23 academic year, there were 11,848 undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in the faculty.

Troitsky Bridge Building Competition
The Troitsky Bridge Building Competition brings together engineering students from across Canada and parts of the United States. Teams of students representing their universities must build a 1-metre-long bridge using only regular popsicle sticks, toothpicks, dental floss, and white glue. A panel of judges grades the bridges based on originality and presentation while a hydraulic loading device is used to determine the maximum load and performance.

===Faculty of Fine Arts===
The Faculty of Fine Arts offers 26 undergraduate programs and 17 graduate programs. It includes nine departments and four research institutes. During the 2022-23 academic year, there were 3,982 undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in the faculty. Among the departments is The Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema. It is informally identified as MHSoC, and offers study in the fields of film animation, film production and film studies. It is the largest, university-based centre for the study of film animation, film production and film studies in Canada.

===John Molson School of Business===

The John Molson School of Business (formerly the Faculty of Commerce and Administration) offers 18 different programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels from five different departments. The departments are Accountancy, Finance, Marketing, Management and Supply Chain and Business Technology Management. During the 2022-23 academic year there were 9,097 undergraduate students and graduate students enrolled, and John Molson School has 61,000 alumni. The John Molson School is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). The business school is located in a LEED silver-certified building.

===Rankings and reputation===
Concordia University has placed well in postsecondary school rankings. The 2024 &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; ranked the university 387 in the world. In the 2023 &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; rankings, the university ranked 501–600 in the world. The 2024 &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot; placed Concordia 501–600 in the world. In &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; 2022–23 global university rankings, the university placed 653rd in the world. The university was also ranked by &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; Canadian university rankings. In October 2023, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; ranked Concordia 9th in Canada under its comprehensive universities category.

The university&#x27;s John Molson School of Business was ranked among the top 10 Canadian business schools and the top 100 worldwide by &quot;The Economist&quot; in 2022. Moreover, Concordia was ranked seventh in Canada and 229th among world universities in the International Professional Classification of Higher Education Institutions, a worldwide ranking compiled by the École des Mines de Paris that uses as its sole criterion the number of graduates occupying the rank of chief executive officer at Fortune 500 companies.

==Student life==
===Student housing===
Four residence buildings are available for students who wish to live on campus: Grey Nuns Residence, Jesuit Residence, Hingston Hall (HA) and Hingston Hall (HB).

For students who choose to live off campus, the Concordia Student Union&#x27;s Off-Campus Housing and Job Bank (HoJo) offers classified ads, legal advice and safety resources.

===Sustainability===
Concordia&#x27;s &quot;sustainability hub&quot; promotes sustainable development.
In February 2019, Concordia became the first university in Canada to issue a sustainable bond. According to the university webpage the bond will &quot;generate environmental and social benefits as defined by the United Nations&#x27; Sustainable Development Goals&quot;. According to Denis Cossette, the university&#x27;s chief financial officer, &quot;the $25-million senior unsecured bond offers investors a 3.626 per cent yield and has a duration of 20 years.&quot; Because of this bond, Concordia would be able to issue sustainable bonds instead of green bonds.

===Athletics===

Concordia University&#x27;s athletic teams are called the Concordia Stingers. They compete with other schools in Canadian Interuniversity Sport, and more specifically, in the Quebec Student Sports Federation and the Quebec University Football League. The university has 10 varsity teams. In the fall, teams compete in Canadian football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rugby union and sport wrestling. There are female and male wrestlers on the team from year to year, and they compete as one team. In the winter, teams compete in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball.

The Concordia Stingers women&#x27;s ice hockey team won the Canadian national championships in 1998, 1999 and 2022. The Stingers baseball club beat Cape Breton University Capers 12–2 to win the 2009 National Baseball Crown.

===Student organizations===
The Concordia Student Union (CSU) represents undergraduate students. Its membership totals more than 35,000 students. Concordia students voted in favour of accreditation of their student union in a referendum in December 2000. As a result, the CSU is now legally accountable only to its student constituents.

The Graduate Students&#x27; Association (GSA) represents the collective interests and promotes the general welfare of the graduate students of Concordia University. Its membership was more than 10,000 students for the 2022-23 academic year.

Another noteworthy aspect of Concordia University is the number of longstanding fee-levy groups which provide numerous services, funded by the student population in the form of per-credit fees. These include the People&#x27;s Potato, which offers a four-course vegan meal, the anti-capitalist grocery store The Frigo Vert, and the Coop Bookstore. .

Concordia University is home to local and international fraternities and sororities: 
* - Delta Phi Epsilon sorority, represented by the &quot;Beta Pi chapter&quot;, was established at Concordia in 1994. 
* - Zeta Tau Omega sorority was founded in 1968 by six women studying at Montreal.
* - Mu Omicron Zeta fraternity (MOZ) was founded in 1992. 
* The Brotherhood of Omicron is another locally based fraternity at Concordia, formed in 1965.
* - Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity has its &quot;Kappa Chi chapter&quot; at Concordia, which was founded in 1967 at Loyola College.
* - Alpha Epsilon Pi (ΑΕΠ) — the largest fraternity in Canada—established its &quot;Gamma Lambda chapter&quot; at Concordia in 2015.
:: &quot;ΣΘΠ&quot; - Sigma Thêta Pi fraternity founded its &quot;Mu chapter&quot; on the Concordia campus in 2015?, but this has since gone dormant.

===Student media===
Concordia University has a campus radio station, CJLO, and television station, CUTV. Concordia also has three student-run newspapers, &quot;The Link&quot;, &quot;The Concordian&quot; and French-language &quot;L&#x27;Organe&quot;. &quot;The Concordian&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Organe&quot; are members of Canadian University Press (CUP); &quot;The Link&quot; left the CUP network in 2012. The university also assists in the publishing of the only student-run, bilingual literary/arts magazine, &quot;The Void&quot;, founded in 2002, as well as arts magazine &quot;Interfold&quot;.

==Student activism==
===Sir George Williams affair===
The Sir George Williams affair (also referred to as &quot;The Sir George Williams Computer Centre Incident&quot;) was a 1969 event at Sir George Williams University now a part of Concordia University. It was the largest student occupation in Canadian history, and resulted in $2 million of property damage. Among those arrested and convicted were Roosevelt Douglas, who later became Prime Minister of Dominica, and who was a son of one of the richest men in Dominica. Also arrested was Anne Cools, who later became a Canadian Senator. Deeply involved also was student Cheddi &quot;Joey&quot; Jagan Jr., who was of Indo-Guyanese and Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and the son of Cheddi Jagan, an American-educated dentist and former Premier and Chief Minister of British Guiana at the time, and his American wife Janet Jagan who was a nurse.

===Strike of 1999===
As the 1990s progressed, student activism began growing, coming to a head in 1999 with the election of the first in a series of radical slates to the Concordia Student Union. Under the presidency of Rob Green, a referendum regarding a strike garnered 2,284 votes of support. This was an unusually strong show of support, as student governments at Concordia are often elected on the basis of less than 1,000 votes in their favour. The strike lasted from November 3 to 5 and targeted a range of issues, including student representation in the university senate, corporate presence and advertising on campus, and government. There were several demonstrations, where both protesters and police were reported to be injured.

===Anti-Netanyahu riot===

On September 9, 2002, a scheduled speech from the former (and later subsequent) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was cancelled following violent pro-Palestinian riots inside the Henry F. Hall Building. Protestors raised concerns about Israeli human rights abuses in the Palestinian territories, namely in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu accused protestors of being supporters of terrorism. The event is depicted in a documentary named &quot;Confrontation at Concordia&quot;.

<doc id="42922" wikidata="Q907151" url="?curid=42922" title="Comparison of Java and C++">
<text>Java and C++ are two prominent object-oriented programming languages. By many language popularity metrics, the two languages have dominated object-oriented and high-performance software development for much of the 21st century, and are often directly compared and contrasted. Java&#x27;s syntax was based on C/C++.

== Design aims ==
The differences between the programming languages C++ and Java can be traced to their heritage, as they have different design goals.

C++ was designed for systems and applications programming (i.e., infrastructure programming), extending the procedural programming language C, which was designed for efficient execution. To C, C++ added support for object-oriented programming, exception handling, lifetime-based resource management (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)), generic programming, template metaprogramming, and the C++ Standard Library which includes generic containers and algorithms (the Standard Template Library or STL), and many other general purpose facilities.

Java is a general-purpose, concurrent, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to minimize implementation dependencies. It relies on a Java virtual machine to be secure and highly portable. It is bundled with an extensive library designed to provide abstraction of the underlying platform. Java is a statically typed object-oriented language that uses a syntax similar to (but incompatible with) C++. It includes a documentation system called Javadoc.

The different goals in the development of C++ and Java resulted in different principles and design trade-offs between the languages. The differences are as follows:

== Language features ==

=== Syntax ===

* Java syntax has a context-free grammar that can be parsed by a simple LALR parser. Parsing C++ is more complicated. For example, is a sequence of comparisons if Foo is a variable, but creates an object if Foo is the name of a class template.
* C++ allows namespace-level constants, variables, and functions. In Java, such entities must belong to some given type, and therefore must be defined inside a type definition, either a class or an interface.
* In C++, objects are values, while in Java they are not. C++ uses &quot;value semantics&quot; by default, while Java always uses &quot;reference semantics&quot;. To opt for reference semantics in C++, either a pointer or a reference can be used.
* C++ supports codice_1 statements, which may lead to spaghetti code programming. With the exception of the goto statement (which is very rarely seen in real code and highly discouraged), both Java and C++ have basically the same control flow structures, designed to enforce structured control flow, and relies on break and continue statements to provide some codice_2-like functions. Some commenters point out that these labelled flow control statements break the single point-of-exit property of structured programming.
* C++ provides low-level features which Java mostly lacks (one notable exception being the codice_3 API for direct memory access and manipulation). In C++, pointers can be used to manipulate specific memory locations, a task necessary for writing low-level operating system components. Similarly, many C++ compilers support an inline assembler. Assembly language code can be imported to a C/C++ program and vice versa. This makes C/C++ language even faster. In Java, such code must reside in external libraries, and can only be accessed via the Java Native Interface, with a significant overhead for each call.

=== Semantics ===
* C++ allows default values for arguments of a function/method. Java does not. However, method overloading can be used to obtain similar results in Java but generate redundant stub code.
* The minimum of code needed to compile for C++ is a function, for Java is a class. However, since Java 21 with the introduction of the unnamed class, it is possible to write a Java program consisting only of a main function.
* C++ allows a range of implicit conversions between native types (including some narrowing conversions), and also allows defining implicit conversions involving user-defined types. In Java, only widening conversions between native types are implicit; other conversions require explicit cast syntax.
** A result of this is that although loop conditions (codice_4, codice_5 and the exit condition in codice_6) in Java and C++ both expect a boolean expression, code such as codice_7 will cause a compile error in Java because there is no implicit narrowing conversion from int to boolean, but will compile in C++. This is handy if the code was a typo and codice_8 was intended. However, current C++ compilers will usually generate a warning when such an assignment is performed within a conditional expression. Similarly, standalone comparison statements, e.g. codice_9, without a side effect usually lead to a warning.
* For passing parameters to functions, C++ supports both pass-by-reference and pass-by-value. In Java, primitive parameters are always passed by value. Class types, interface types, and array types are collectively called reference types in Java and are also always passed by value.
* Java built-in types are of a specified size and range defined by the language specification. In C++, a minimal range of values is defined for built-in types, but the exact representation (number of bits) can be mapped to whatever native types are preferred on a given platform.
** For instance, Java characters are 16-bit Unicode characters, and strings are composed of a sequence of such characters. C++ offers both narrow and wide characters, but the actual size of each is platform dependent, as is the character set used. Strings can be formed from either type.
** This also implies that C++ compilers can automatically select the most efficient representation for the target platform (i.e., 64-bit integers for a 64-bit platform), while the representation is fixed in Java, meaning the values can either be stored in the less-efficient size, or must pad the remaining bits and add code to emulate the reduced-width behavior.
* The rounding and precision of floating point values and operations in C++ is implementation-defined (although only very exotic or old platforms depart from the IEEE 754 standard). Java provides an optional &quot;strict floating-point model&quot; (strictfp) that guarantees more consistent results across platforms, though at the cost of possibly slower run-time performance. However, Java does not comply strictly with the IEEE 754 standard. Most C++ compilers will, by default, comply partly with IEEE 754 (usually excluding strict rounding rules and raise exceptions on NaN results), but provide compliance options of varied strictness, to allow for some optimizing. If we label those options from least compliant to most compliant as &quot;fast&quot;, &quot;consistent&quot; (Java&#x27;s &quot;strictfp&quot;), &quot;near-IEEE&quot;, and &quot;strict-IEEE&quot;, we can say that most C++ implementations default to &quot;near-IEEE&quot;, with options to switch to &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;strict-IEEE&quot;, while Java defaults to &quot;fast&quot; with an option to switch to &quot;consistent&quot;.
* In C++, pointers can be manipulated directly as memory address values. Java references are pointers to objects. Java references do not allow direct access to memory addresses or allow memory addresses to be manipulated with pointer arithmetic. In C++ one can construct pointers to pointers, pointers to ints and doubles, and pointers to arbitrary memory locations. Java references only access objects, never primitives, other references, or arbitrary memory locations. In Java, memory can be read and written by arbitrary values using the codice_3 API, however it is deprecated and not recommended.
* In C++, pointers can point to functions or member functions (function pointers). The equivalent mechanism in Java uses object or interface references.
* Via stack-allocated objects, C++ supports scoped resource management, a technique used to automatically manage memory and other system resources that supports deterministic object destruction. While scoped resource management in C++ cannot be guaranteed (even objects with proper destructors can be allocated using codice_11 and left undeleted) it provides an effective means of resource management. Shared resources can be managed using codice_12, along with codice_13 to break cyclic references. Java supports automatic memory management using garbage collection which can free unreachable objects even in the presence of cyclic references, but other system resources (files, streams, windows, communication ports, threads, etc.) must be explicitly released because garbage collection is not guaranteed to occur immediately after the last object reference is abandoned.
* C++ features user-defined operator overloading. Operator overloading allows for user-defined types to support operators (arithmetic, comparisons, etc.) like primitive types via user-defined implementations for these operators. It is generally recommended to preserve the semantics of the operators. Java supports no form of operator overloading (although its library uses the addition operator for string concatenation).
* Java features standard application programming interface (API) support for reflective programming (reflection) and dynamic loading of arbitrary new code.
* C++ supports static and dynamic linking of binaries.
* Java has generics, which main purpose is to provide type-safe containers. C++ has compile-time templates, which provide more extensive support for generic programming and metaprogramming. Java has annotations, which allow adding arbitrary custom metadata to classes and metaprogramming via an annotation processing tool.
* Both Java and C++ distinguish between native types (also termed &quot;fundamental&quot; or &quot;built-in&quot; types) and user-defined types (also termed &quot;compound&quot; types). In Java, native types have value semantics only, and compound types have reference semantics only. In C++ all types have value semantics, but a reference can be created to any type, which will allow the object to be manipulated via reference semantics.
* C++ supports multiple inheritance of arbitrary classes. In Java a class can derive from only one class, but a class can implement multiple interfaces (in other words, it supports multiple inheritance of types, but only single inheritance of implementation).
* Java explicitly distinguishes between interfaces and classes. In C++, multiple inheritance and pure virtual functions make it possible to define classes that function almost like Java interfaces do, with a few small differences.
* Java has both language and standard library support for multi-threading. The codice_14 keyword in Java provides mutex locks to support multi-threaded applications. Java also provides libraries for more advanced multi-threading synchronizing. C++11 has a defined memory model for multi-threading in C++, and library support for creating threads and for many synchronizing primitives. There are also many third-party libraries for this.
* C++ member functions can be declared as virtual functions, which means the method to be called is determined by the run-time type of the object (a.k.a. dynamic dispatching). By default, methods in C++ are not virtual (i.e., &quot;opt-in virtual&quot;). In Java, methods are virtual by default, but can be made non-virtual by using the codice_15 keyword (i.e., &quot;opt-out virtual&quot;).
* C++ enumerations are primitive types and support implicit conversion to integer types (but not from integer types). Java enumerations can be and are used like classes. Another way is to make another class that extends codice_16) and may therefore define constructors, fields, and methods as any other class. As of C++11, C++ supports strongly-typed enumerations which provide more type-safety and explicit specification of the storage type.
* Unary operators and : in C++ &quot;The operand shall be a modifiable lvalue. [skipped] The result is the updated operand; it is an lvalue...&quot;, but in Java &quot;the binary numeric promotion mentioned above may include unboxing conversion and value set conversion. If necessary, value set conversion {and/or [...] boxing conversion} is applied to the sum prior to its being stored in the variable.&quot;, i.e. in Java, after the initialization changes the reference by assigning new object, while in C++ the object is still the same.

=== Resource management ===
* Java offers automatic garbage collection, which may be bypassed in specific circumstances via the Real time Java specification. Memory management in C++ is usually done via constructors, destructors, and smart pointers. The C++ standard permits garbage collection, but does not require it. Garbage collection is rarely used in practice.
* C++ can allocate arbitrary blocks of memory. Java only allocates memory via object instantiation. Arbitrary memory blocks may be allocated in Java as an array of bytes. 
* Java and C++ use different idioms for resource management. Java relies mainly on garbage collection, which can reclaim memory, while C++ relies mainly on the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) idiom. This is reflected in several differences between the two languages:
** In C++ it is common to allocate objects of compound types as local stack-bound variables which are destroyed when they go out of scope. In Java compound types are always allocated on the heap and collected by the garbage collector (except in virtual machines that use escape analysis to convert heap allocations to stack allocations).
** C++ has destructors, while Java has finalizers. Both are invoked before an object&#x27;s deallocation, but they differ significantly. A C++ object&#x27;s destructor must be invoked implicitly (in the case of stack-bound variables) or explicitly to deallocate an object. The destructor executes synchronously just before the point in a program at which an object is deallocated. Synchronous, coordinated uninitializing and deallocating in C++ thus satisfy the RAII idiom. Destructors in C++ is the normal way of getting back the resources associated with an object, and is a needed counterpart to constructors. In Java, object deallocation is implicitly handled by the garbage collector. A Java object&#x27;s finalizer is invoked asynchronously some time after it has been accessed for the last time and before it is deallocated. Very few objects need finalizers. A finalizer is needed by only objects that must guarantee some cleanup of the object state before deallocating, typically releasing resources external to the JVM. Direct usages of finalizers are usually not advised, as they are unpredictable, usually dangerous, and most of the time unneeded. One has to be cautious not to think of finalizers as C++ destructors. Rather, the try-with-resources or try-finally block achieves a more similar purpose as the destructor. One problem with finalizers or cleaners is that it is not guaranteed that they will run immediately. Hence, a finalizer should never be used for tasks that are time-critical. Additionally, finalizers come with severe performance penalties and significantly increase the time it takes for objects to be deallocated, so their use is discouraged and deprecated in Java 9. 
** With RAII in C++, one type of resource is typically wrapped inside a small class that allocates the resource upon construction and releases the resource upon destruction, and provide access to the resource in between those points. Any class that contain only such RAII objects do not need to define a destructor since the destructors of the RAII objects are called automatically as an object of this class is destroyed. In Java, safe synchronous deallocation of resources can be performed deterministically using the try/catch/finally construct. Alternatively, the try-with-resources construct, which was introduced in Java 7, should be used in preference to try-finally construct. The try-with-resources construct is more concise and readable. It also provide more helpful diagnostic information, since suppressed exception are not discarded, and will be printed in the stack trace with information saying that they were suppressed.
** In C++, it is possible to have a dangling pointer, a stale reference to an object that has already been deallocated. Attempting to use a dangling pointer typically results in program failure. In Java, the garbage collector will not destroy a referenced object.
** In C++, it is possible to have uninitialized primitive objects. Java enforces default initialization.
** In C++, it is possible to have an allocated object to which there is no valid reference. Such an unreachable object cannot be destroyed (deallocated), and results in a memory leak. In contrast, in Java an object will not be deallocated by the garbage collector &quot;until&quot; it becomes unreachable (by the user program). (&quot;Weak references&quot; are supported, which work with the Java garbage collector to allow for different &quot;strengths&quot; of reachability.) Garbage collection in Java prevents many memory leaks, but leaks are still possible under some circumstances. The automatic garbage collector may give the false impression that in Java one does not need to think about memory management. However this is not quite true. Loosely speaking, this is because a program can have &quot;memory leaks&quot;, more formally known as &quot;unintentional object retentions&quot;. An example of a memory leak that may occur is for a program that has been written without any logical errors, except that it did not eliminate obsolete references. This results in higher use of garbage collector activity, higher memory footprint. In extreme circumstances, this problem can lead to an codice_17, but this rarely happens. 
 The solution to this is to null out object references. A second common reason for memory leak is the use of cache that has become no longer relevant. The solution to memory leaks due to using old cache is to represent the cache using a codice_18.

=== Libraries ===
* C++ provides cross-platform access to many features typically available in platform-specific libraries. Direct access from Java to native operating system and hardware functions requires the use of the Java Native Interface, or since Java 21, the Foreign Function and Memory API, which allow for allocating and managing memory outside of the Java Virtual Machine, as well as calling native (i.e. C/C++) functions.
* The C++ standard library is designed to be minimalistic, providing only a standardised set of general use features, while the Java Class Library and Java Platform Module System (the Java standard library) is much more extensive, providing a much larger comprehensive standardised set of features, such as graphics, UI creation, and more.

=== Runtime ===

* Due to its unconstrained expressiveness, low level C++ language features (e.g. unchecked array access, raw pointers, type punning) cannot be reliably checked at compile-time or without overhead at run-time. Related programming errors can lead to low-level buffer overflows and segmentation faults. The Standard Template Library provides higher-level RAII abstractions (like vector, list and map) to help avoid such errors. In Java, low level errors either cannot occur or are detected by the Java virtual machine (JVM) and reported to the application in the form of an exception.
* The Java language requires specific behavior in the case of an out-of-bounds array access, which generally requires bounds checking of array accesses. This eliminates a possible source of instability but usually at the cost of slowing execution. In some cases, especially since Java 7, compiler analysis can prove a bounds check unneeded and eliminate it. C++ has no required behavior for out-of-bounds access of native arrays, thus requiring no bounds checking for native arrays. C++ standard library collections like std::vector, however, offer optional bounds checking. In summary, Java arrays are &quot;usually safe; slightly constrained; often have overhead&quot; while C++ native arrays &quot;have optional overhead; are slightly unconstrained; are possibly unsafe.&quot;

=== Templates vs. generics ===
Both C++ and Java provide facilities for generic programming, templates and generics, respectively. Although they were created to solve similar kinds of problems, and have similar syntax, they are quite different.

=== Miscellaneous ===
* Java and C++ use different means to divide code into multiple source files. 
** Java uses a package system that dictates the file name and path for all program definitions. Its compiler imports the executable class files. 
** Prior to C++20, C++ used a header file source code inclusion system to share declarations between source files. Since C++20, however, modules were introduced offering similar functionality to Java packages, however C++ modules do not have the same granularity of Java packages which allowing for importing individual classes - rather, in C++, all symbols marked codice_19 are accessible after importing a module, making it akin to a wildcard import in Java.
** Since C++23, the C++ standard library can now be imported as a module, but must be imported in its entirety rather than importing specific packages of the library like in Java, with import std;. This may change in the future, with proposals to separate the standard library into more modules such as codice_20, codice_21, and codice_22.
* The term &quot;module&quot; refers to different things. In Java, a module is used to group several packages together, meanwhile in C++ a module represents a single translation unit.
** codice_23 in C++ imports a module by linking it at compilation, however in C++, modules do not dictate the namespace which a symbol belongs to. Meanwhile, codice_23 in Java does not actually &quot;import&quot; any code into a file, and is used to alias classes to avoid fully qualifying them. This is because all classes are handled as needed during runtime by the Java class loader on demand, and can be invoked even without &quot;importing&quot;, simply by fully qualifying the class.
* A Java source file must match the namespace which of the public class it declares (it may be named anything if there are no public classes), and the package it belongs to must match the path it is located in. A package may only declare at most one public class (but may have multiple non-public classes).
* A C++ source file (whether a header or module) may have any arbitrary name, and may contain as many classes as the programmer desires. Modules have no requirement to match the path of its location.
* Compiled Java code files are generally smaller than code files in C++ as Java bytecode is usually more compact than native machine code and Java programs are never statically linked.
* C++ compiling features an added textual preprocessing phase, while Java does not. Thus some users add a preprocessing phase to their build process for better support of conditional compiling.
* Java&#x27;s division and modulus operators are well defined to truncate to zero. C++ (pre-C++11) does not specify whether or not these operators truncate to zero or &quot;truncate to -infinity&quot;. -3/2 will always be -1 in Java and C++11, but a C++03 compiler may return either -1 or -2, depending on the platform. C99 defines division in the same fashion as Java and C++11. Both languages guarantee (where a and b are integer types) that codice_25 for all a and b (b != 0). The C++03 version will sometimes be faster, as it is allowed to pick whichever truncation mode is native to the processor.
* The sizes of integer types are defined in Java (int is 32-bit, long is 64-bit), while in C++ the size of integers and pointers is compiler and application binary interface (ABI) dependent within given constraints. Thus a Java program will have consistent behavior across platforms, whereas a C++ program may require adapting for some platforms, but may run faster with more natural integer sizes for the local platform.

== Performance ==
In addition to running a compiled Java program, computers running Java applications generally must also run the Java virtual machine (JVM), while compiled C++ programs can be run without external applications. Early versions of Java were significantly outperformed by statically compiled languages such as C++. This is because the program statements of these two closely related languages may compile to a few machine instructions with C++, while compiling into several byte codes involving several machine instructions each when interpreted by a JVM. For example:
Since performance optimization is a very complex issue, it is very difficult to quantify the performance difference between C++ and Java in general terms, and most benchmarks are unreliable and biased. Given the very different natures of the languages, definitive qualitative differences are also difficult to draw. In a nutshell, there are inherent inefficiencies and hard limits on optimizing in Java, given that it heavily relies on flexible high-level abstractions, however, the use of a powerful JIT compiler (as in modern JVM implementations) can mitigate some issues. In any case, if the inefficiencies of Java are too great, compiled C or C++ code can be called from Java via the JNI.

Some inefficiencies that are inherent to the Java language include, mainly:

* All objects are allocated on the heap. Though allocation is extremely fast in modern JVMs using &#x27;bump allocation&#x27;, which performs similarly to stack allocation, performance can still be negatively impacted due to the invocation of the garbage collector. Modern JIT compilers mitigate this problem to some extent with escape analysis or escape detection to allocate some objects on the stack, since Oracle JDK 6.
* Performance-critical projects like efficient database systems and messaging libraries have had to use internal unofficial APIs like codice_3 to gain access to manual resource management and be able to do stack allocation; effectively manipulating pseudo-pointers.
* A lot of run-time casting required even using standard containers induces a performance penalty. However, most of these casts are statically eliminated by the JIT compiler.
* Safety guarantees come at a run-time cost. For example, the compiler is required to put appropriate range checks in the code. Guarding each array access with a range check is not efficient, so most JIT compilers will try to eliminate them statically or by moving them out of inner loops (although most native compilers for C++ will do the same when range-checks are optionally used).
* Lack of access to low-level details prevents the developer from improving the program where the compiler is unable to do so.
* The mandatory use of reference-semantics for all user-defined types in Java can introduce large amounts of superfluous memory indirections (or jumps) (unless elided by the JIT compiler) which can lead to frequent cache misses (a.k.a. cache thrashing). Furthermore, cache-optimization, usually via cache-aware or cache-oblivious data structures and algorithms, can often lead to orders of magnitude improvements in performance as well as avoiding time-complexity degeneracy that is characteristic of many cache-pessimizing algorithms, and is therefore one of the most important forms of optimization; reference-semantics, as mandated in Java, makes such optimizations impossible to realize in practice (by neither the programmer nor the JIT compiler).
* Garbage collection, as this form of automatic memory management introduces memory overhead.

However, there are a number of benefits to Java&#x27;s design, some realized, some only theorized:

* Java garbage collection may have better cache coherence than the usual use of &quot;malloc&quot;/&quot;new&quot; for memory allocation. Nevertheless, arguments exist that both allocators equally fragment the heap and neither exhibits better cache locality. However, in C++, allocation of single objects on the heap is rare, and large quantities of single objects are usually allocated in blocks via an STL container and/or with a small object allocator.
* Run-time compiling can potentially use information about the platform on which the code is being executed to improve code more effectively. However, most state-of-the-art native (C, C++, etc.) compilers generate multiple code paths to employ the full computational abilities of the given system. Also, the inverse argument can be made that native compilers can better exploit architecture-specific optimizing and instruction sets than multi-platform JVM distributions.
* Run-time compiling allows for more aggressive virtual function inlining than is possible for a static compiler, because the JIT compiler has more information about all possible targets of virtual calls, even if they are in different dynamically loaded modules. Currently available JVM implementations have no problem in inlining most of the monomorphic, mostly monomorphic and dimorphic calls, and research is in progress to inline also megamorphic calls, thanks to the recent invoke dynamic enhancements added in Java 7. Inlining can allow for further optimisations like loop vectorisation or loop unrolling, resulting in a huge overall performance increase.
* In Java, thread synchronizing is built into the language, so the JIT compiler can potentially, via escape analysis, elide locks, significantly improve the performance of naive multi-threaded code.

Also, some performance problems occur in C++:

* Allowing pointers to point to any address can make optimizing difficult due to the possibility of pointer aliasing.
* Since the code generated from various instantiations of the same class template in C++ is not shared (as with type-erased generics in Java), excessive use of templates may lead to significant increase of the executable code size (code bloat). However, because function templates are aggressively inlined, they can sometimes reduce code size, but more importantly allow for more aggressive static analysis and code optimizing by the compiler, more often making them more efficient than non-templated code. In contrast, Java generics are necessarily less efficient than non-genericized code.
* Because in a traditional C++ compiler, dynamic linking is performed after code generating and optimizing in C++, function calls spanning different dynamic modules cannot be inlined. However modern C++ compilers like MSVC and Clang+LLVM offer link-time-code-generation options that allow modules to be compiled to intermediate formats which allows inlining at the final link stage.

== Official standard and reference of the language ==

=== Language specification ===
The C++ language is defined by &quot;ISO/IEC 14882&quot;, an ISO standard, which is published by the &quot;ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG21&quot; committee. The latest, post-standardization draft of C++17 is available as well.

The C++ language evolves via an open steering committee called the C++ Standards Committee. The committee is composed of the creator of C++ Bjarne Stroustrup, the convener Herb Sutter, and other prominent figures, including many representatives of industries and user-groups (i.e., the stake-holders). Being an open committee, anyone is free to join, participate, and contribute proposals for upcoming releases of the standard and technical specifications. The committee now aims to release a new standard every few years, although in the past strict review processes and discussions have meant longer delays between publication of new standards (1998, 2003, and 2011).

The Java language is defined by the &quot;Java Language Specification&quot;, a book which is published by Oracle.

The Java language continuously evolves via a process called the Java Community Process, and the world&#x27;s programming community is represented by a group of people and organizations - the Java Community members—which is actively engaged into the enhancement of the language, by sending public requests - the Java Specification Requests - which must pass formal and public reviews before they get integrated into the language.

The lack of a firm standard for Java and the somewhat more volatile nature of its specifications have been a constant source of criticism by stake-holders wanting more stability and conservatism in the addition of new language and library features. In contrast, the C++ committee also receives constant criticism, for the opposite reason, i.e., being too strict and conservative, and taking too long to release new versions.

<text>Pine is a freeware, text-based email client which was developed at the University of Washington. The first version was written in 1989, and announced to the public in March 1992. Source code was available for only the Unix version under a license written by the University of Washington. Pine is no longer under development, and has been replaced by the Alpine client, which is available under the Apache License.

==Supported platforms==
There are Unix, Windows, and Linux versions of Pine. The Unix/Linux version is text user interface based—its message editor inspired the text editor Pico. The Windows (and formerly DOS) version is called PC-Pine. WebPine was available to individuals associated with the University of Washington (students, faculty, etc.)—a version of Pine implemented as a web application.

Many people believe that Pine stands for &quot;Pine Is Not Elm&quot;. One of its original authors, Laurence Lundblade, insists this was never the case and that it started off simply as a word and not an acronym, and that his first choice of a backronym for pine would be &quot;Pine Is Nearly Elm&quot;. Over time, it was changed by the university to mean &quot;Program for Internet News and E-mail&quot;. The original announcement said: &quot;Pine was originally based on Elm, but it has evolved much since, (&#x27;Pine Is No-longer Elm&#x27;).&quot;

==Licensing and clones==
Up to version 3.91, the Pine license was similar to BSD, and it stated that

:&quot;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its documentation for any purpose and without fee to the University of Washington is hereby granted …&quot;

The university registered a trademark for the Pine name with respect to &quot;computer programs used in communication and electronic mail applications&quot; in March 1995.

From version 3.92, the holder of the copyright, the University of Washington, changed the license so that even if the source code was still available, they did &quot;not&quot; allow modifications and changes to Pine to be distributed by anyone other than themselves. They also claimed that even the old license never allowed distribution of modified versions.

The trademark for the Pine name was part of their position in this matter.

In reaction, some developers forked version 3.91 under the name MANA (for &quot;Mail And News Agent&quot;) to avoid the trademark issue and the GNU Project adopted it as GNU Mana. Richard Stallman claims that the University of Washington threatened to sue the Free Software Foundation for distributing the modified Pine program, resulting in the development of MANA ceasing and no versions being released.

The Pico clone GNU nano was also written due to the change in licensing terms of Pine and Pico, as explained by nano&#x27;s author in a blog post criticizing the license in 2001.

The University of Washington later modified their license somewhat to allow unmodified distribution of Pine alongside collections of free software, but the license still does not conform to the Open Source and the Free Software Guidelines so it is source-available software.
==Alpine==

In 2006, the University of Washington announced that it stopped development of Pine with Pine 4.64, although Pine continues to be supported.

In its place is a new family of email tools based upon Pine, called Alpine and licensed under the Apache License, version 2. November 29, 2006 saw the first public alpha release, which forms a new approach, since the alpha test of Pine was always non-public.

Alpine 1.0 was publicly released on December 20, 2007. The most recent version 2.26 was released on June 3, 2022.

<text>John of Damascus or John Damascene, born Yūḥana ibn Manṣūr ibn Sarjūn, was an Assyrian Christian monk, priest, hymnographer, and apologist. He was born and raised in Damascus or AD 676; the precise date and place of his death is not known, though tradition places it at his monastery, Mar Saba, near Jerusalem, on 4 December AD 749. A polymath whose fields of interest and contribution included law, theology, philosophy, and music, he was given the by-name of Chrysorroas (Χρυσορρόας, literally &quot;streaming with gold&quot;, i.e. &quot;the golden speaker&quot;). He wrote works expounding the Christian faith, and composed hymns which are still used both liturgically in Eastern Christian practice throughout the world as well as in western Lutheranism at Easter.

He is one of the Fathers of the Eastern Orthodox Church and is best known for his strong defence of icons. The Catholic Church regards him as a Doctor of the Church, often referred to as the &quot;Doctor of the Assumption&quot; due to his writings on the Assumption of Mary. He was also a prominent exponent of &quot;perichoresis&quot;, and employed the concept as a technical term to describe both the interpenetration of the divine and human natures of Christ and the relationship between the hypostases of the Trinity. John is at the end of the Patristic period of dogmatic development, and his contribution is less one of theological innovation than one of a summary of the developments of the centuries before him. In Catholic theology, he is therefore known as the &quot;last of the Greek Fathers&quot;.

The main source of information for the life of John of Damascus is a work attributed to one John of Jerusalem, identified therein as the Patriarch of Jerusalem. This is an excerpted translation into Greek of an earlier Arabic text. The Arabic original contains a prologue not found in most other translations, and was written by an Arab monk, Michael, who explained that he decided to write his biography in 1084 because none was available in his day. However, the main Arabic text seems to have been written by an unknown earlier author sometime between the early 9th and late 10th century. 
Written from a hagiographical point of view and prone to exaggeration and some legendary details, it is not the best historical source for his life, but is widely reproduced and considered to contain elements of some value. The hagiographic novel &quot;Barlaam and Josaphat&quot; is a work of the 10th century attributed to a monk named John. It was only considerably later that the tradition arose that this was John of Damascus, but most scholars no longer accept this attribution. Instead much evidence points to Euthymius of Athos, a Georgian who died in 1028.

==Family background==
John was born in Damascus, in 675 or 676, to a prominent Damascene Assyrian Christian family. 
His father, Sarjun ibn Mansur, served as an official of the early Umayyad Caliphate. His grandfather, Mansur ibn Sarjun, was a prominent Byzantine official of Damascus, who had been responsible for the taxes of the region during the reign of Emperor Heraclius and also served under Emperor Maurice. 
Mansur seems to have played a role in the capitulation of Damascus to the troops of Khalid ibn al-Walid in 635 after securing favorable conditions of surrender. Eutychius, a 10th-century Melkite patriarch, mentions him as one high-ranking official involved in the surrender of the city to the Muslims.

The tribal background of Mansur ibn Sarjun, John&#x27;s grandfather, is unknown, but biographer Daniel Sahas has speculated that the name Mansur could have implied descent from the Arab Christian tribes of Kalb or Taghlib. 
The name was common among Syrian Christians of Arab origins, and Eutychius noted that the governor of Damascus, who was likely Mansur ibn Sarjun, was an Arab. However, Sahas also asserts that the name does not necessarily imply an Arab background and could have been used by non-Arab, Semitic Syrians. While Sahas and biographers F. H. Chase and Andrew Louth assert that &quot;Mansūr&quot; was an Arabic name, Raymond le Coz asserts that the &quot;family was without doubt of Syrian origin&quot;; indeed, according to historian Daniel J. Janosik, &quot;Both aspects could be true, for if his family ancestry were indeed Syrian, his grandfather [Mansur] could have been given an Arabic name when the Arabs took over the government.&quot; 
When Syria was conquered by the Muslim Arabs in the 630s, the court at Damascus retained its large complement of Christian civil servants, John&#x27;s grandfather among them. John&#x27;s father, Sarjun (Sergius), went on to serve the Umayyad caliphs. John of Jerusalem claims that he also served as a senior official in the fiscal administration of the Umayyad Caliphate under Abd al-Malik before leaving Damascus and his position around 705 to go to Jerusalem and become a monk. However, this point is debated within the academic community as there is no trace of him in the Umayyad archives, unlike his father and grandfather. Some researchers, such as Robert G. Hoyland, deny such an affiliation, while others, like Daniel Sahas or the Orthodox historian Jean Meyendorff, suppose that he might have been a lower-level tax administrator, a local tax collector who would not have needed to be mentioned in the archives, but who might not have necessarily been part of the court either. In addition, John&#x27;s own writings never refer to any experience in a Muslim court. It is believed that John became a monk at Mar Saba, and that he was ordained as a priest in 735.

==Biography==

John was raised in Damascus, and Arab Christian folklore holds that during his adolescence, John associated with the future Umayyad caliph Yazid I and the Taghlibi Christian court poet al-Akhtal.

One of the &quot;vitae&quot; describes his father&#x27;s desire for him to &quot;learn not only the books of the Muslims, but those of the Greeks as well.&quot; From this it has been suggested that John may have grown up bilingual. John does indeed show some knowledge of the Quran, which he criticizes harshly.

Other sources describe his education in Damascus as having been conducted in accordance with the principles of Hellenic education, termed &quot;secular&quot; by one source and &quot;classical Christian&quot; by another. One account identifies his tutor as a monk by the name of Cosmas, who had been kidnapped by Arabs from his home in Sicily, and for whom John&#x27;s father paid a great price. As a refugee from Italy, Cosmas brought with him the scholarly traditions of Latin Christianity. Cosmas was said to have rivaled Pythagoras in arithmetic and Euclid in geometry. He also taught John&#x27;s orphan friend, Cosmas of Maiuma. 

John possibly had a career as a civil servant for the Caliph in Damascus before his ordination.

He then became a priest and monk at the Mar Saba monastery near Jerusalem. 
One source suggests John left Damascus to become a monk around 706, when al-Walid I increased the Islamicisation of the Caliphate&#x27;s administration. 
This is uncertain, as Muslim sources only mention that his father Sarjun (Sergius) left the administration around this time, and fail to name John at all. 
During the next two decades, culminating in the Siege of Constantinople (717-718), the Umayyad Caliphate progressively occupied the borderlands of the Byzantine Empire. An editor of John&#x27;s works, Father Le Quien, has shown that John was already a monk at Mar Saba before the dispute over iconoclasm, explained below.

In the early 8th century, iconoclasm, a movement opposed to the veneration of icons, gained acceptance in the Byzantine court. In 726, despite the protests of Germanus, Patriarch of Constantinople, Emperor Leo III (who had forced his predecessor, Theodosius III, to abdicate and himself assumed the throne in 717 immediately before the great siege) issued his first edict against the veneration of images and their exhibition in public places.

All agree that John of Damascus undertook a spirited defence of holy images in three separate publications. The earliest of these works, his &quot;Apologetic Treatises against those Decrying the Holy Images&quot;, secured his reputation. He not only attacked the Byzantine emperor, but adopted a simplified style that allowed the controversy to be followed by the common people, stirring rebellion among the iconoclasts. Decades after his death, John&#x27;s writings would play an important role during the Second Council of Nicaea (787), which convened to settle the icon dispute.

Leo III reportedly sent forged documents to the caliph which implicated John in a plot to attack Damascus. The caliph then ordered John&#x27;s right hand be cut off and hung up in public view. Some days afterwards, John asked for the restitution of his hand, and prayed fervently to the &quot;Theotokos&quot; before her icon: thereupon, his hand is said to have been miraculously restored. In gratitude for this miraculous healing, he attached a silver hand to the icon, which thereafter became known as the &quot;Three-handed&quot;, or &quot;Tricherousa&quot;. That icon is now located in the Hilandar monastery of the Holy Mountain.

Due to his commitment to iconodulism, he was condemned by anathema by the iconoclastic Council of Hieria in 754. He was later rehabilitated by the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.

==Veneration==
When the name of John of Damascus was inserted in the General Roman Calendar in 1890, it was assigned to 27 March. The feast day was moved in 1969 to the day of John&#x27;s death, 4 December, the day on which his feast day is celebrated also in the Byzantine Rite calendar, Lutheran Commemorations, and the Anglican Communion and Episcopal Church.

John of Damascus is honored in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 4 December.

In 1890, he was declared a Doctor of the Church by Pope Leo XIII.

==List of works==

Besides his purely textual works, many of which are listed below, John of Damascus also composed hymns, perfecting the canon, a structured hymn form used in Byzantine Rite liturgies.

===Early works===
* Three &quot;Apologetic Treatises against those Decrying the Holy Images&quot; – These treatises were among his earliest expositions in response to the edict by the Byzantine Emperor Leo III, banning the veneration or exhibition of holy images.

===Teachings and dogmatic works===
* &quot;The Fountain of Knowledge,&quot; &quot;The Fountain of Wisdom&quot; or &quot;The Fount of Knowledge&quot; (Koinē Greek: Πηγή Γνώσεως, Pēgē gnōseōs, literally meaning “The Source of Knowledge”), is described as a synthesis and unification of Christian philosophy, ideas and doctrine that was influential in directing the course of medieval Latin thought and that became the principal textbook of Greek Orthodox theology. Divided into three parts the chapters are:
*# &quot;Philosophical Chapters&quot; (Koinē Greek: Κεφάλαια φιλοσοφικά&quot;, Kefálea filosofiká&quot;) – commonly called &quot;Dialectic&quot;, it deals mostly with logic, its primary purpose being to prepare the reader for a better understanding of the rest of the book. Based on the previous work of the late 3rd-century Neoplatonist Porphyry’s Isagoge, an introduction to the logic of Aristotle. The work was notable in that it allowed John of Damascus with information to explain the basic concepts of logic and the rationalisation of God.
*# &quot;Concerning Heresy&quot; (Koinē Greek: Περὶ αἱρέσεων, &quot;Perì eréseon&quot;, literally meaning “About Heresies”) – Based on the previous work of the Panarion. (Koinē Greek: Πανάριον, derived from Latin &quot;panarium&quot;, meaning &quot;bread basket&quot;) by Epiphanius of Salamis. The work was notable it allowed John with information about different heresies as well as a model for how to organize a catalogue of heresies. In original 80 religious sects which either classed as organized groups or philosophies, from the time of Adam to the latter part of the fourth century according to Epiphanius. John added twenty heresies that had occurred during his time. The last chapter of &quot;Concerning Heresy&quot; (Chapter 101) deals with the &quot;Heresy of the Ishmaelites&quot;. Unlike earlier sections devoted to other heresies, which are disposed of succinctly in just a few lines, this chapter runs into several pages. It constitutes one of the first Christian refutations of Islam. In treating of &quot;Heresy of the Ishmaelites&quot; he vigorously assails the immoral practices of Muhammad and the corrupt teachings inserted in the Quran to legalize the delinquencies of the prophet. &quot;Concerning Heresy&quot; was frequently translated from Greek into Latin. His manuscript is one of the first Orthodox Christian refutations of Islam which has influenced the Western Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s attitude on Islam. It was among the first sources representing Muhammad to the West as a &quot;false prophet&quot; and &quot;Antichrist&quot;. 
*# &quot;An Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith&quot; (Koinē Greek: Ἔκδοσις Ἀκριβὴς τῆς Ὀρθοδόξου Πίστεως&quot;, Ékdosis akribès tēs Orthodóxou Písteōs&quot;) – a summary of the teachings and dogmatic writings of the early Church Fathers, and more specifically the Cappadocian Fathers (Saint Basil, Saint Gregory of Nazianzus and Saint Gregory of Nyssa) from the 4th century. It incorporates Aristotelian language and demonstrates originality through John&#x27;s selection of texts and annotations influenced by Antiochene analytical theology. This work, when translated into Oriental languages and Latin, became a valuable resource for both Eastern and Western thinkers, offering logical and theological concepts. Additionally, its systematic style served as a model for subsequent theological syntheses composed by medieval Scholastics. The &quot;Exposition&quot; delves into speculations about the nature and existence of God, giving rise to points of debate among later theologians. This writing was the first work of systematic theology in Eastern Christianity and an important influence on later Scholastic works.

====Views on Islam====
In the final chapter of &quot;Concerning Heresy&quot;, John mentions Islam as &quot;the Heresy of the Ishmaelites&quot;. He is one of the first known Christian critics of Islam. John claims that Muslims were once worshipers of Aphrodite who followed after Muhammad because of his &quot;seeming show of piety,&quot; and that Mohammad himself read the Bible and, &quot;likewise, it seems,&quot; spoke to an Arian monk that taught him Arianism instead of Christianity. John also claims to have read the Quran, or at least parts of it, as he criticizes the Quran for saying that the Virgin Mary was the sister of Moses and Aaron and that Jesus was not crucified but brought alive into heaven. John further claims to have spoken to Muslims about Mohammad. He uses the plural &quot;we&quot;, whether in reference to himself, or to a group of Christians that he belonged to who spoke to the Muslims, or in reference to Christians in general.

Regardless, John claims that he asked the Muslims what witnesses can testify that Muhammad received the Quran from God – since, John says, Moses received the Torah from God in the presence of the Israelites, and since Islamic law mandates that a Muslim can only marry and do trade in the presence of witnesses – and what biblical prophets and verses foretold Muhammad &#x27;s coming – since, John says, Jesus was foretold by the prophets and whole Old Testament. John claims that the Muslims answered that Muhammad received the Quran in his sleep. John claims that he jokingly answered, &quot;You&#x27;re spinning my dreams.&quot;

Some of the Muslims, John says, claimed that the Old Testament that Christians believe foretells Jesus&#x27; coming is misinterpreted, while other Muslims claimed that the Jews edited the Old Testament so as to deceive Christians (possibly into believing Jesus is God, but John does not say).

While recounting his alleged dialogue with Muslims, John claims that they have accused him of idol worship for venerating the Cross and worshipping Jesus. John claims that he told the Muslims that the black stone in Mecca was the head of a statue of Aphrodite. Moreover, he claims, the Muslims would be better off to associate Jesus with God if they say Jesus is the Word of God and Spirit. John claims that the word and the spirit are inseparable from that in which they exist and if the Word of God has always existed in God, then the Word must be God.

John ends the chapter by claiming that Islam permits polygamy, that Muhammad committed adultery with a companion&#x27;s wife before outlawing adultery, and that the Quran is filled with stories, such as the She-Camel of God and God giving Jesus an &quot;incorruptible table.&quot;

==Arabic translation==

It is believed that the homily on the Annunciation was the first work to be translated into Arabic. Much of this text is found in Manuscript 4226 of the Library of Strasbourg (France), dating to AD 885.

Later in the 10th century, Antony, superior of the monastery of St. Simon (near Antioch) translated a corpus of John Damascene. In his introduction to John&#x27;s work, Sylvestre patriarch of Antioch (1724–1766) said that Antony was monk at Saint Saba. This could be a misunderstanding of the title Superior of Saint Simon probably because Saint Simon&#x27;s monastery was in ruins in the 18th century.

Most manuscripts give the text of the letter to Cosmas, the philosophical chapters, the theological chapters and five other small works.

In 1085, Mikhael, a monk from Antioch, wrote the Arabic life of the Chrysorrhoas. This work was first edited by Bacha in 1912 and then translated into many languages (German, Russian and English).

<text>The term cryostasis was introduced to name the reversible preservation technology for live biological objects which is based on using clathrate-forming gaseous substances under increased hydrostatic pressure and hypothermic temperatures.

Living tissues cooled below the freezing point of water are damaged by the dehydration of the cells as ice is formed between the cells. The mechanism of freezing damage in living biological tissues has been elucidated by Renfret.

The vapor pressure of the ice is lower than the vapor pressure of the solute water in the surrounding cells and as heat is removed at the freezing point of the solutions, the ice crystals grow between the cells, extracting water from them. As the ice crystals grow, the volume of the cells shrinks, and the cells are crushed between the ice crystals. Additionally, as the cells shrink, the solutes inside the cells are concentrated in the remaining water, increasing the intracellular ionic strength and interfering with the organization of the proteins and other organized intercellular structures. Eventually, the solute concentration inside the cells reaches the eutectic and freezes. The final state of frozen tissues is pure ice in the former extracellular spaces, and inside the cell membranes a mixture of concentrated cellular components in ice and bound water. In general, this process is not reversible to the point of restoring the tissues to life.

Cryostasis utilizes clathrate-forming gases that penetrate and saturate the biological tissues causing clathrate hydrates formation (under specific pressure-temperature conditions) inside the cells and in the extracellular matrix. Clathrate hydrates are a class of solids in which gas molecules occupy &quot;cages&quot; made up of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. These &quot;cages&quot; are unstable when empty, collapsing into conventional ice crystal structure, but they are stabilised by the inclusion of the gas molecule within them. Most low molecular weight gases (including CH4, H2S, Ar, Kr, and Xe) will form a hydrate under some pressure-temperature conditions.
Clathrates formation will prevent the biological tissues from dehydration which will cause irreversible inactivation of intracellular enzymes.

<text>In general, detection is the action of accessing information without specific cooperation from with the sender.

In the history of radio communications, the term &quot;detector&quot; was first used for a device that detected the simple presence or absence of a radio signal, since all communications were in Morse code. The term is still in use today to describe a component that extracts a particular signal from all of the electromagnetic waves present. Detection is usually based on the frequency of the carrier signal, as in the familiar frequencies of radio broadcasting, but it may also involve filtering a faint signal from noise, as in radio astronomy, or reconstructing a hidden signal, as in steganography.

In optoelectronics, &quot;detection&quot; means converting a received optical input to an electrical output. For example, the light signal received through an optical fiber is converted to an electrical signal in a detector such as a photodiode.

In steganography, attempts to detect hidden signals in suspected carrier material is referred to as steganalysis. Steganalysis has an interesting difference from most other types of detection, in that it can often only determine the probability that a hidden message exists; this is in contrast to the detection of signals which are simply encrypted, as the ciphertext can often be identified with certainty, even if it cannot be decoded. 

In the military, detection refers to the special discipline of reconnaissance with the aim to recognize the presence of an object in a location or ambiance.

Finally, the art of detection, also known as &quot;following clues&quot;, is the work of a detective in attempting to reconstruct a sequence of events by identifying the relevant information in a situation.

<text>A photodiode is a semiconductor diode sensitive to photon radiation, such as visible light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays. It produces an electrical current when it absorbs photons. This can be used for detection and measurement applications, or for the generation of electrical power in solar cells. Photodiodes are used in a wide range of applications throughout the electromagnetic spectrum from visible light photocells to gamma ray spectrometers.

==Principle of operation==

A photodiode is a PIN structure or p–n junction. When a photon of sufficient energy strikes the diode, it creates an electron–hole pair. This mechanism is also known as the inner photoelectric effect. If the absorption occurs in the junction&#x27;s depletion region, or one diffusion length away from it, these carriers are swept from the junction by the built-in electric field of the depletion region. Thus holes move toward the anode, and electrons toward the cathode, and a photocurrent is produced. The total current through the photodiode is the sum of the dark current (current that is passed in the absence of light) and the photocurrent, so the dark current must be minimized to maximize the sensitivity of the device.

To first order, for a given spectral distribution, the photocurrent is linearly proportional to the irradiance.

===Photovoltaic mode===

In photovoltaic mode (zero bias), photocurrent flows into the anode through a short circuit to the cathode. If the circuit is opened or has a load impedance, restricting the photocurrent out of the device, a voltage builds up in the direction that forward biases the diode, that is, anode positive with respect to cathode. If the circuit is shorted or the impedance is low, a forward current will consume all or some of the photocurrent. This mode exploits the photovoltaic effect, which is the basis for solar cells – a traditional solar cell is just a large area photodiode. For optimum power output, the photovoltaic cell will be operated at a voltage that causes only a small forward current compared to the photocurrent.

===Photoconductive mode===

In photoconductive mode the diode is reverse biased, that is, with the cathode driven positive with respect to the anode. This reduces the response time because the additional reverse bias increases the width of the depletion layer, which decreases the junction&#x27;s capacitance and increases the region with an electric field that will cause electrons to be quickly collected. The reverse bias also creates dark current without much change in the photocurrent.

Although this mode is faster, the photoconductive mode can exhibit more electronic noise due to dark current or avalanche effects. The leakage current of a good PIN diode is so low (&lt;1 nA) that the Johnson–Nyquist noise of the load resistance in a typical circuit often dominates.

==Related devices==
Avalanche photodiodes are photodiodes with structure optimized for operating with high reverse bias, approaching the reverse breakdown voltage. This allows each &quot;photo-generated&quot; carrier to be multiplied by avalanche breakdown, resulting in internal gain within the photodiode, which increases the effective &quot;responsivity&quot; of the device.
A phototransistor is a light-sensitive transistor. A common type of phototransistor, the &quot;bipolar phototransistor&quot;, is in essence a bipolar transistor encased in a transparent case so that light can reach the &quot;base–collector junction&quot;. It was invented by John N. Shive at Bell Labs in 1948 but it was not announced until 1950. The electrons that are generated by photons in the base–collector junction are injected into the base, and this photodiode current is amplified by the transistor&#x27;s current gain β (or hfe). If the base and collector leads are used and the emitter is left unconnected, the phototransistor becomes a photodiode. While phototransistors have a higher responsivity for light they are not able to detect low levels of light any better than photodiodes. Phototransistors also have significantly longer response times. Another type of phototransistor, the &quot;field-effect phototransistor&quot; (also known as photoFET), is a light-sensitive field-effect transistor. Unlike photobipolar transistors, photoFETs control drain-source current by creating a gate voltage.

A solaristor is a two-terminal gate-less phototransistor. A compact class of two-terminal phototransistors or solaristors have been demonstrated in 2018 by ICN2 researchers. The novel concept is a two-in-one power source plus transistor device that runs on solar energy by exploiting a memresistive effect in the flow of photogenerated carriers.

==Materials==
The material used to make a photodiode is critical to defining its properties, because only photons with sufficient energy to excite electrons across the material&#x27;s bandgap will produce significant photocurrents.

Materials commonly used to produce photodiodes are listed in the table below.

Because of their greater bandgap, silicon-based photodiodes generate less noise than germanium-based photodiodes.

Binary materials, such as MoS2, and graphene emerged as new materials for the production of photodiodes.

==Unwanted and wanted photodiode effects==
Any p–n junction, if illuminated, is potentially a photodiode. Semiconductor devices such as diodes, transistors and ICs contain p–n junctions, and will not function correctly if they are illuminated by unwanted light. This is avoided by encapsulating devices in opaque housings. If these housings are not completely opaque to high-energy radiation (ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays), diodes, transistors and ICs can malfunction due to induced photo-currents. Background radiation from the packaging is also significant. Radiation hardening mitigates these effects.

In some cases, the effect is actually wanted, for example to use LEDs as light-sensitive devices (see LED as light sensor) or even for energy harvesting, then sometimes called &quot;light-emitting and light-absorbing diodes&quot; (LEADs).

==Features==

Critical performance parameters of a photodiode include spectral responsivity, dark current, response time and noise-equivalent power.

; Spectral responsivity: The spectral responsivity is a ratio of the generated photocurrent to incident light power, expressed in A/W when used in photoconductive mode. The wavelength-dependence may also be expressed as a &quot;quantum efficiency&quot; or the ratio of the number of photogenerated carriers to incident photons which is a unitless quantity.
; Dark current: The dark current is the current through the photodiode in the absence of light, when it is operated in photoconductive mode. The dark current includes photocurrent generated by background radiation and the saturation current of the semiconductor junction. Dark current must be accounted for by calibration if a photodiode is used to make an accurate optical power measurement, and it is also a source of noise when a photodiode is used in an optical communication system.
; Response time: The response time is the time required for the detector to respond to an optical input. A photon absorbed by the semiconducting material will generate an electron–hole pair which will in turn start moving in the material under the effect of the electric field and thus generate a current. The finite duration of this current is known as the transit-time spread and can be evaluated by using Ramo&#x27;s theorem. One can also show with this theorem that the total charge generated in the external circuit is e and not 2e as one might expect by the presence of the two carriers. Indeed, the integral of the current due to both electron and hole over time must be equal to e. The resistance and capacitance of the photodiode and the external circuitry give rise to another response time known as RC time constant (formula_1). This combination of R and C integrates the photoresponse over time and thus lengthens the impulse response of the photodiode. When used in an optical communication system, the response time determines the bandwidth available for signal modulation and thus data transmission.
; Noise-equivalent power: Noise-equivalent power (NEP) is the minimum input optical power to generate photocurrent, equal to the rms noise current in a 1 hertz bandwidth. NEP is essentially the minimum detectable power. The related &quot;characteristic detectivity&quot; (formula_2) is the inverse of NEP (1/NEP) and the &quot;specific detectivity&quot; (formula_3) is the detectivity multiplied by the square root of the area (formula_4) of the photodetector (formula_5) for a 1 Hz bandwidth. The specific detectivity allows different systems to be compared independent of sensor area and system bandwidth; a higher detectivity value indicates a low-noise device or system. Although it is traditional to give (formula_3) in many catalogues as a measure of the diode&#x27;s quality, in practice, it is hardly ever the key parameter.

When a photodiode is used in an optical communication system, all these parameters contribute to the &quot;sensitivity&quot; of the optical receiver which is the minimum input power required for the receiver to achieve a specified &quot;bit error rate&quot;.

==Applications==
P–n photodiodes are used in similar applications to other photodetectors, such as photoconductors, charge-coupled devices (CCD), and photomultiplier tubes. They may be used to generate an output which is dependent upon the illumination (analog for measurement), or to change the state of circuitry (digital, either for control and switching or for digital signal processing).

Photodiodes are used in consumer electronics devices such as compact disc players, smoke detectors, medical devices and the receivers for infrared remote control devices used to control equipment from televisions to air conditioners. For many applications either photodiodes or photoconductors may be used. Either type of photosensor may be used for light measurement, as in camera light meters, or to respond to light levels, as in switching on street lighting after dark.

Photosensors of all types may be used to respond to incident light or to a source of light which is part of the same circuit or system. A photodiode is often combined into a single component with an emitter of light, usually a light-emitting diode (LED), either to detect the presence of a mechanical obstruction to the beam (slotted optical switch) or to couple two digital or analog circuits while maintaining extremely high electrical isolation between them, often for safety (optocoupler). The combination of LED and photodiode is also used in many sensor systems to characterize different types of products based on their optical absorbance.

Photodiodes are often used for accurate measurement of light intensity in science and industry. They generally have a more linear response than photoconductors.

They are also widely used in various medical applications, such as detectors for computed tomography (coupled with scintillators), instruments to analyze samples (immunoassay), and pulse oximeters.

PIN diodes are much faster and more sensitive than p–n junction diodes, and hence are often used for optical communications and in lighting regulation.

P–n photodiodes are not used to measure extremely low light intensities. Instead, if high sensitivity is needed, avalanche photodiodes, intensified charge-coupled devices or photomultiplier tubes are used for applications such as astronomy, spectroscopy, night vision equipment and laser rangefinding.

===Comparison with photomultipliers===

Advantages compared to photomultipliers:

# Excellent linearity of output current as a function of incident light
# Spectral response from 190 nm to 1100 nm (silicon), longer wavelengths with other semiconductor materials
# Low noise
# Ruggedized to mechanical stress
# Low cost
# Compact and light weight
# Long lifetime
# High quantum efficiency, typically 60–80%
# No high voltage required

Disadvantages compared to photomultipliers:

# Small area
# No internal gain (except avalanche photodiodes, but their gain is typically 102–103 compared to 105-108 for the photomultiplier)
# Much lower overall sensitivity
# Photon counting only possible with specially designed, usually cooled photodiodes, with special electronic circuits
# Response time for many designs is slower
# Latent effect

===Pinned photodiode===

The pinned photodiode (PPD) has a shallow implant (P+ or N+) in N-type or P-type diffusion layer, respectively, over a P-type or N-type (respectively) substrate layer, such that the intermediate diffusion layer can be fully depleted of majority carriers, like the base region of a bipolar junction transistor. The PPD (usually PNP) is used in CMOS active-pixel sensors; a precursor NPNP triple junction variant with the MOS buffer capacitor and the back-light illumination scheme with complete charge transfer and no image lag was invented by Sony in 1975. This scheme was widely used in many applications of charge transfer devices.

Early charge-coupled device image sensors suffered from shutter lag. This was largely explained with the re-invention of the pinned photodiode. It was developed by Nobukazu Teranishi, Hiromitsu Shiraki and Yasuo Ishihara at NEC in 1980. Sony in 1975 recognized that lag can be eliminated if the signal carriers could be transferred from the photodiode to the CCD. This led to their invention of the pinned photodiode, a photodetector structure with low lag, low noise, high quantum efficiency and low dark current. It was first publicly reported by Teranishi and Ishihara with A. Kohono, E. Oda and K. Arai in 1982, with the addition of an anti-blooming structure. The new photodetector structure invented by Sony in 1975, developed by NEC in 1982 by Kodak in 1984 was given the name &quot;pinned photodiode&quot; (PPD) by B.C. Burkey at Kodak in 1984. In 1987, the PPD began to be incorporated into most CCD sensors, becoming a fixture in consumer electronic video cameras and then digital still cameras.

A CMOS image sensor with a low-voltage-PPD technology was first fabricated in 1995 by a joint JPL and Kodak team. The CMOS sensor with PPD technology was further advanced and refined by R.M. Guidash in 1997, K. Yonemoto and H. Sumi in 2000, and I. Inoue in 2003. This led to CMOS sensors achieve imaging performance on par with CCD sensors, and later exceeding CCD sensors.

==Photodiode array==

A one-dimensional array of hundreds or thousands of photodiodes can be used as a position sensor, for example as part of an angle sensor. A two-dimensional array is used in image sensors and optical mice.

In some applications, photodiode arrays allow for high-speed parallel readout, as opposed to integrating scanning electronics as in a charge-coupled device (CCD) or CMOS sensor. The optical mouse chip shown in the photo has parallel (not multiplexed) access to all 16 photodiodes in its 4 × 4 array.

===Passive-pixel image sensor===
The passive-pixel sensor (PPS) is a type of photodiode array. It was the precursor to the active-pixel sensor (APS). A passive-pixel sensor consists of passive pixels which are read out without amplification, with each pixel consisting of a photodiode and a MOSFET switch. In a photodiode array, pixels contain a p–n junction, integrated capacitor, and MOSFETs as selection transistors. A photodiode array was proposed by G. Weckler in 1968, predating the CCD. This was the basis for the PPS.

The noise of photodiode arrays is sometimes a limitation to performance. It was not possible to fabricate active pixel sensors with a practical pixel size in the 1970s, due to limited microlithography technology at the time.

<doc id="42939" wikidata="Q4826378" url="?curid=42939" title="Autolysin">
<text>Autolysins are endogenous lytic enzymes that break down the peptidoglycan components of biological cells which enables the separation of daughter cells following cell division. They are involved in cell growth, cell wall metabolism, cell division and separation, as well as peptidoglycan turnover and have similar functions to lysozymes.

Autolysin is formed from the precursor gene, Atl. Amidases (EC 3.5.1.28), gametolysin (EC 3.4.24.38), and glucosaminidase are considered as types of autolysins.

== Function and mechanisms ==

Autolysins exist in all bacteria containing peptidoglycan and are potentially considered as lethal enzymes when uncontrolled. They target the glycosidic bonds as well as the cross-linked peptides of the peptidoglycan matrix. The peptidoglycan matrix functions for cell wall stability to protect from turgor changes and carries out function for immunological defense. These enzymes break down the peptidoglycan matrix in small sections to allow for peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Autolysins breaks down old peptidoglycan which allows for the formation of newer peptidoglycan for cell growth and elongation. This is called cell wall turnover. Autolysins do this by hydrolyzing the β-(1,4) glycosidic bond of the peptidoglycan cell wall and the linkage between N-acetylmuramoyl residues and L-amino acid residues of certain cell-wall glycopeptides. This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction:

: Cleavage of the proline- and hydroxyproline-rich proteins of the &quot;Chlamydomonas&quot; cell wall; also cleaves azocasein, gelatin and Leu-Trp-Met-Arg-Phe-Ala

This glycoprotein is present in &quot;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&quot; gametes.

Gram-positive bacteria regulate autolysins with teichoic acid molecules attached to the tetrapeptide of the peptidoglycan matrix.

The antibiotics complestatin and corbomycin prevent autolysin from remodeling the cell wall by binding to peptidoglycan, therefore stopping bacterial growth. The amide linkages between stem peptide and lactyl moiety of muramoyl residue are cleaved by N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases and partakes in cell separation and the dissociation of the cell septum. There are 5 types of autolysins that contribute to cell separation of daughter cells, LytC, LytD, LytE, and LytF.

In a study conducted with mice, those that were immunized with autolysin were able to survive longer than the infected mice. This study was able to support as evidence autolysin&#x27;s contribution in virulence and potential for vaccine antigen.

=== Lysis of mother cell ===

LytC and CwlC are two amidases from the LytC family that hydrolyze the peptidoglycan of the mother cell wall to allow for the release of the mature endospore. CwlC is directly found in the mother cell wall.

=== Motility ===
Expression of lytC, lytD, and lytF genes together leads to flagellar motility and is controlled by the activity of the chemotaxis sigma factor,  σD. The activity of this sigma factor peaks at the start of the stationary phase.

=== Potential lethality ===
Autolysins are naturally produced by peptidoglycan containing bacteria, but excessive amounts will degrade the peptidoglycan matrix and cause the cell to burst due to osmotic pressure. Previous studies have found that the byproducts of autolysin during cell wall breakdown are highly immunogenic. When observed in the bacteria, &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;, there were potentially lethal amounts of autolysin found in the cell walls. In &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; it was found that N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, a cell wall autolysin, could assist in pathogenesis due to its ability to break down the wall or lyse a portion of the invading pneumococci and release potentially lethal toxins into the cell. Researchers studied the function, structure, and cloning ability through &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and also determined its nucleotide sequence.

== Families ==

=== LytC amidase family ===

==== LytC ====
LytC as well as LytD are considered as two major autolysins that contribute to vegetative cell wall growth and account for 95% of the autolytic activity in B. subtilis. LytC is found in the cell wall. LytB, a non-autolysin, was found to enhance LytC activity. LytC and LytA interact and function together for lysis and cell death.

==== CwlC ====
CwlC is found in the mother cell wall and functions for the lysis of the mother cell wall. CwlC does not have a signal sequence but participates in late sporulation and is present in the cell wall. It was found in B. subtilis that CwlC is able to hydrolyze both vegetative cell walls and spore peptidoglycan.

=== LytD glucosaminidase family ===
This family of autolysin consist of only LytD itself. LytD functions for vegetative growth. Autolytic activity is found within the C-terminal region with catalytic domain homologous to the glucosaminidase domain. LytD is found in the cell wall. LytD activity was studied in B. subtilis and glucosaminidase activity was found in mature glycan strands due to the presence of MurNAc at the nonreducing ends.

<doc id="42940" wikidata="Q4915303" url="?curid=42940" title="Biostasis">
<text>Biostasis is the ability of an organism to tolerate environmental changes without having to actively adapt to them. Biostasis is found in organisms that live in habitats that likely encounter unfavorable living conditions, such as drought, freezing temperatures, change in pH levels, pressure, or temperature. Insects undergo a type of dormancy to survive these conditions, called diapause. Diapause may be obligatory for these insects to survive. The insect may also be able to undergo change prior to the arrival of the initiating event.

==Microorganisms==
Biostasis in this context is also synonymous for viable but nonculturable state. In the past when bacteria were no longer growing on culture media it was assumed that they were dead. Now we can understand that there are many instances where bacteria cells may go into biostasis or suspended animation, fail to grow on media, and on resuscitation are again culturable. VBNC state differs from &#x27;starvation survival state&#x27; (where a cell just reduces metabolism significantly). Bacteria cells may enter the VBNC state as a result of some outside stressor such as &quot;starvation, incubation outside the temperature range of growth, elevated osmotic concentrations (seawater), oxygen concentrations, or exposure to white light&quot;. Any of these instances could very easily mean death for the bacteria if it was not able to enter this state of dormancy. It has also been observed that in may instances where it was thought that bacteria had been destroyed (pasteurization of milk) and later caused spoilage or harmful effects to consumers because the bacteria had entered the VBNC state.

Effects on cells entering the VBNC state include &quot;dwarfing, changes in metabolic activity, reduced nutrient transport, respiration rates and macromolecular synthesis&quot;. Yet biosynthesis continues, and shock proteins are made. Most importantly has been observed that ATP levels and generation remain high, completely contrary to dying cells which show rapid decreases in generation and retention. Changes to the cell walls of bacteria in the VBNC state have also been observed. In Escherichia coli a large amount of cross-linking was observed in the peptidoglycan. The autolytic capability was also observed to be much higher in VBNC cells than those who were in the growth state.

It is far easier to induce bacteria to the VBNC state and once bacteria cells have entered the VBNC state it is very hard to return them to a culturable state. &quot;They examined nonculturability and resuscitation in Legionella pneumophila and while entry into this state was easily induced by nutrient starvation, resuscitation could only be demonstrated following co-incubation of the VBNC cells with the amoeba, &quot;Acanthamoeba Castellani&quot;&quot;

Fungistasis or mycostasis a naturally occurring VBNC (viable but nonculturable) state found in fungi in soil. Watson and Ford defined fungistasis as &quot;when viable fungal propagules, which are not subject to endogenous or constitutive dormancy do not germinate in soil at their favorable temperature or moisture conditions or growth of fungal hyphae is retarded or terminated by conditions of the soil environment other than temperature or moisture&quot;. Essentially (and mostly observed naturally occurring in soil) several types of fungi have been found to enter the VBNC state resulting from outside stressors (temperature, available nutrients, oxygen availability etc.) or from no observable stressors at all.

== Current research ==
On March 1, 2018, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced their new Biostasis program under the direction of Dr. Tristan McClure-Begley. The aim of the Biostasis program is to develop new possibilities for extending the golden hour in patients who suffered a traumatic injury by slowing down the human body at the cellular level, addressing the need for additional time in continuously operating biological systems faced with catastrophic, life-threatening events. By leveraging molecular biology, the program aims to control the speed at which living systems operate and figure out a way to &quot;slow life to save life.&quot;

On March 20, 2018, the Biostasis team held a Webinar which, along with a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), solicited five-year research proposals from outside organizations. The full proposals were due on May 22, 2018.

=== Possible approaches ===
In their Webinar, DARPA outlined a number of possible research approaches for the Biostasis project. These approaches are based on research into diapause in tardigrades and wood frogs which suggests that selective stabilization of intracellular machinery occurs at the protein level.

==== Protein chaperoning ====
In molecular biology, molecular chaperones are proteins that assist in the folding, unfolding, assembly, or disassembly of other macromolecular structures. Under typical conditions, molecular chaperones facilitate changes in shape (conformational change) of macromolecules in response to changes in environmental factors like temperature, pH, and voltage. By reducing conformational flexibility, scientists can constrain the function of certain proteins. Recent research has shown that proteins are promiscuous, or able to do jobs in addition to the ones they evolved to carry out. Additionally, protein promiscuity plays a key role in the adaptation of species to new environments. It is possible that finding a way to control conformational change in promiscuous proteins could allow scientists to induce biostasis in living organisms.

==== Intracellular crowding ====
The crowdedness of cells is a critical aspect of biological systems. Intracellular crowding refers to the fact that protein function and interaction with water is constrained when the interior of the cell is overcrowded. Intracellular organelles are either membrane-bound vesicles or membrane-less compartments that compartmentalize the cell and enable spatiotemporal control of biological reactions. By introducing these intracellular polymers to a biological system and manipulating the crowdedness of a cell, scientists may be able to slow down the rate of biological reactions in the system.

==== Tardigrade-disordered proteins ====
Tardigrades are microscopic animals that are able to enter a state of diapause and survive a remarkable array of environmental stressors, including freezing and desiccation. Research has shown that intrinsically disordered proteins in these organisms may work to stabilize cell function and protect against these extreme environmental stressors. By using peptide engineering, it is possible that scientists may be able to introduce intrinsically disordered proteins to the biological systems of larger animal organisms. This could allow larger animals to enter a state of biostasis similar to that of tardigrades under extreme biological stress.

<doc id="42942" wikidata="Q424099" url="?curid=42942" title="Chitinase">
<text>Chitinases (, chitodextrinase, 1,4-β-poly-N-acetylglucosaminidase, poly-β-glucosaminidase, β-1,4-poly-N-acetyl glucosamidinase, poly[1,4-(N-acetyl-β--glucosaminide)] glycanohydrolase, (1→4)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β--glucan glycanohydrolase; systematic name (1→4)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β--glucan glycanohydrolase) are hydrolytic enzymes that break down glycosidic bonds in chitin. They catalyse the following reaction:

: Random endo-hydrolysis of &quot;N&quot;-acetyl-β--glucosaminide (1→4)-β-linkages in chitin and chitodextrins

As chitin is a component of the cell walls of fungi and exoskeletal elements of some animals (including mollusks and arthropods), chitinases are generally found in organisms that either need to reshape their own chitin or dissolve and digest the chitin of fungi or animals.

== Species distribution ==

Chitinivorous organisms include many bacteria (Aeromonads, &quot;Bacillus&quot;, &quot;Vibrio&quot;, among others), which may be pathogenic or detritivorous. They attack living arthropods, zooplankton or fungi or they may degrade the remains of these organisms.

Fungi, such as &quot;Coccidioides immitis&quot;, also possess degradative chitinases related to their role as detritivores and also to their potential as arthropod pathogens.

Chitinases are also present in plants – for example barley seed chitinase: , . Barley seeds are found to produce clone 10 in Ignatius et al 1994(a). They find clone 10, a Class I chitinase, in the seed aleurone during development. Leaves produce several isozymes (as well as several of β-1,3-glucanase). Ignatius et al 1994(b) find these in the leaves, induced by powdery mildew. Ignatius et al also find these (seed and leaf isozymes) to differ from each other. Some of these are pathogenesis related (PR) proteins that are induced as part of systemic acquired resistance. Expression is mediated by the NPR1 gene and the salicylic acid pathway, both involved in resistance to fungal and insect attack. Other plant chitinases may be required for creating fungal symbioses.

Although mammals do not produce chitin, they have two functional chitinases, Chitotriosidase (CHIT1) and acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase), as well as chitinase-like proteins (such as YKL-40) that have high sequence similarity but lack chitinase activity.

== Classification ==

# Endochitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) randomly split chitin at internal sites of the chitin microfibril, forming soluble, low molecular mass multimer products. The multimer products includes di-acetylchitobiose, chitotriose, and chitotetraose, with the dimer being the predominant product.
#Exochitinases have also been divided into two sub categories:
## Chitobiosidases () act on the non-reducing end of the chitin microfibril, releasing the dimer, di-acetylchitobiose, one by one from the chitin chain. Therefore, there is no release of monosaccharides or oligosaccharides in this reaction.
## β-1,4- &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosaminidases () split the multimer products, such as di-acetylchitobiose, chitotriose, and chitotetraose, into monomers of &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucoseamine (GlcNAc).
Chitinases were also classified based on the amino acid sequences, as that would be more helpful in understanding the evolutionary relationships of these enzymes to each other. Therefore, the chitinases were grouped into three families: 18, 19, and 20. Both families 18 and 19 consists of endochitinases from a variety of different organisms, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, insect, and plants. However, family 19 mainly comprises plant chitinases. Family 20 includes &quot;N-&quot;acetylglucosaminidase and a similar enzyme, &quot;N&quot;-acetylhexosaminidase.

And as the gene sequences of the chitinases were known, they were further classified into six classes based on their sequences. Characteristics that determined the classes of chitinases were the &quot;N&quot;-terminal sequence, localization of the enzyme, isoelectric pH, signal peptide, and inducers.

 chitinases had a cysteine-rich &quot;N&quot;-terminal, leucine- or valine-rich signal peptide, and vacuolar localization. And then, Class I chitinases were further subdivided based on their acidic or basic nature into and , respectively. Class 1 chitinases were found to comprise only plant chitinases and mostly endochitinases.

 chitinases did not have the cysteine-rich &quot;N&quot;-terminal but had a similar sequence to Class I chitinases. Class II chitinases were found in plants, fungi, and bacteria and mostly consisted of exochitinases.

 chitinases did not have similar sequences to chitinases in Class I or Class II.

 chitinases had similar characteristics, including the immunological properties, as Class I chitinases. However, Class IV chitinases were significantly smaller in size compared to Class I chitinases.

 and chitinases are not well characterized. However, one example of a Class V chitinase showed two chitin binding domains in tandem, and based on the gene sequence, the cysteine-rich &quot;N&quot;-terminal seemed to have been lost during evolution, probably due to less selection pressure that caused the catalytic domain to lose its function.

== Function ==
Like cellulose, chitin is an abundant biopolymer that is relatively resistant to degradation. Many mammals can digest chitin and the specific chitinase levels in vertebrate species are adapted to their feeding behaviours. Certain fish are able to digest chitin. Chitinases have been isolated from the stomachs of mammals, including humans.

Chitinase activity can also be detected in human blood and possibly cartilage. As in plant chitinases this may be related to pathogen resistance.

== Clinical significance ==
Chitinases production in the human body (known as &quot;human chitinases&quot;) may be in response to allergies, and asthma has been linked to enhanced chitinase expression levels.

Human chitinases may explain the link between some of the most common allergies (dust mites, mold spores—both of which contain chitin) and worm (helminth) infections, as part of one version of the hygiene hypothesis (worms have chitinous mouthparts to hold the intestinal wall). Finally, the link between chitinases and salicylic acid in plants is well established—but there is a hypothetical link between salicylic acid and allergies in humans.

May be used to monitor enzymotherapy supplementation in Gaucher&#x27;s disease.

== Regulation in fungi ==
Regulation varies from species to species, and within an organism, chitinases with different physiological functions would be under different regulation mechanisms. For example, chitinases that are involved in maintenance, such as remodeling the cell wall, are constitutively expressed. However, chitinases that have specialized functions, such as degrading exogenous chitin or participating in cell division, need spatio-temporal regulation of the chitinase activity.

The regulation of an endochitinase in &quot;Trichoderma atroviride&quot; is dependent on a &quot;N-&quot;acetylglucosaminidase, and the data indicates a feedback-loop where the break down of chitin produces &quot;N-&quot;acetylglucosamine, which would be possibly taken up and triggers up-regulation of the chitinbiosidases.

In &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; and the regulation of ScCts1p (&quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; chitinase 1), one of the chitinases involved in cell separation after cytokinesis by degrading the chitin of the primary septum. As these types of chitinases are important in cell division, there must be tight regulation and activation. Specifically, &quot;Cts1&quot; expression has to be activated in daughter cells during late mitosis and the protein has to localize at the daughter site of the septum. And to do this, there must be coordination with other networks controlling the different phases of the cell, such as Cdc14 Early Anaphase Release (FEAR), mitotic exit network (MEN), and regulation of Ace2p (transcription factor) and cellular morphogenesis (RAM) signalling networks. Overall, the integration of the different regulatory networks allows for the cell wall degrading chitinase to function dependent on the cell&#x27;s stage in the cell cycle and at specific locations among the daughter cells.

== Presence in food ==
Chitinases occur naturally in many common foods. &quot;Phaseolus vulgaris&quot;, bananas, chestnuts, kiwifruit, avocados, papaya, and tomatoes, for example, all contain significant levels of chitinase, as defense against fungal and invertebrate attack. Stress, or environmental signals like ethylene gas, may stimulate increased production of chitinase.

Some parts of chitinase molecules, almost identical in structure to hevein or other proteins in rubber latex due to their similar function in plant defense, may trigger an allergic cross-reaction known as latex-fruit syndrome.

== Applications ==
Chitinases have a wealth of applications, some of which have already been realized by industry. This includes bio-conversion of chitin to useful products such as fertilizer, the production of non-allergenic, non-toxic, biocompatible, and biodegradable materials (contact lenses, artificial skin and sutures with these qualities are already being produced) and enhancement of insecticides and fungicides. &quot;Phaseolus vulgaris&quot; chitinase - bean chitinase, BCH - has been transgenically inserted as a pest deterrent into entirely unrelated crops.

Possible future applications of chitinases are as food additives to increase shelf life, therapeutic agent for asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis, as an anti-fungal remedy, an anti-tumor drug and as a general ingredient to be used in protein engineering.

<text>The Encyclopedia Astronautica is a reference web site on space travel. The encyclopedia includes 79,433 articles with 13,741 illustrations, a comprehensive catalog of missiles, spacecraft, space technology, astronauts, and spaceflight from most countries that have had an active rocket research program. It provides biographies of important pioneers of spaceflight such as Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Hermann Oberth Robert Goddard. It outlines various concepts of space stations including the NASA Space Shuttle and the Soviet Buran programme.

== Articles ==
In addition, the encyclopedia contains many comprehensive review articles on specific space topics, among them:
* &quot;Germany&quot; incl. an extensive list of German missile specialists who worked for USA, USSR and France after World War II.
* &quot;Russia - Early Ballistic Missiles&quot; with a history of the involvement of German rocket specialists in Soviet rocketry.
* &quot;Russia: The Real Moon Landing Hoax&quot; about the Space Race.
* &quot;Russia: What did the CIA know and when did they know it?&quot; with an overview of the CIA&#x27;s knowledge and assessments of Soviet missile technology.
* Historical data of space travel for each calendar day.

Since 2019, the site is no longer updated or maintained. Although it contains a great deal of information, not all of it is correct.

==History==
Founded in 1994 and maintained for most of its existence by space enthusiast and author Mark Wade. He has been collecting such information for most of his life. Between 1996 and 2000 the site was hosted by &quot;Friends and Partners in Space&quot;.

==Reception and accolades==
The American Astronautical Society gave the site the &quot;Ordway Award for Sustained Excellence in Spaceflight History&quot; which &quot;recognizes exceptional, sustained efforts to inform and educate on spaceflight and its history through one or more media&quot; in 2015, the award&#x27;s initial year. The award is named for U.S. space engineer and author Frederick I. Ordway III (1927–2014).

&quot;Telepolis&quot; journalist Marcus Hammerschmitt warmly recommended the &quot;Encyclopedia Astronautic&quot; to anyone interested in space flight, and speculated that its articles might become valued material for future researcher of cultural history.

In 2006, the American space historian Stephen B. Johnson stated that Encyplopedia Astronautica &quot;has become a popular Internet source for space history. Unfortunately, while it contains a great deal of information, not all of it is correct. Space historians have noticed a variety of factual problems, and unfortunately these problems have not been consistently repaired. Since this is not a peer-reviewed source and historical errors have not always been fixed, this cannot be considered a reliable source, despite its impressive appearance. Many other online sources have the same problem.&quot;

<text>A lip piercing is a type of body piercing that penetrates the lips or the area surrounding the lips, which can be pierced in a variety of ways.

== Procedure and healing ==
Approximate healing time for most lip piercings is between 1 and 3 months; however, there is a possibility of serious infection if the piercing is not properly taken care of. After healing is complete, other jewelry may be used. After this time, some scar tissue may be present, but the fistula is normally fully developed and mostly healed. Aftercare consists of hot saline soaks two to three times daily. Soaking the wound for three to five minutes with a weak saline solution softens any blood and lymph discharge attached to the jewelry. Afterwards, taking a hot shower and using clean hands and a small amount of a mild soap such as castile soap removes excess matter from the site. Turning or otherwise moving jewelry on a fresh piercing is not advised, as it can irritate and lengthen swelling and healing time. Diluted mouthwash or salt water solution can also be used after meals along with toothbrushing to help remove debris and flush the piercing and is recommended by practitioners.

Initial jewelry is usually a labret stud or a captive bead ring, manufactured from implant-grade titanium or similar lightweight and inert metal. No matter which type of jewelry is used, the jewelry&#x27;s diameter and length will be intentionally oversized to allow room for initial swelling. After healing, the jewelry can be replaced with a closer-fitting piece.
A home-made saline solution made from non-iodized sea salt and hot distilled or filtered water is a common way to heal a lip piercing and avoid infection. This solution can be used to rinse out the mouth after eating (or the mouth can be rinsed with non-alcoholic, non-antimicrobial mouth wash) and to soak the outside of the piercing. Anything with alcohol, peroxide, iodine, or any strong soaps should be avoided because they may irritate the fresh piercing, and cause additional swelling and trauma during the healing process. Using peroxide, iodine, teatree oil, conventional antibacterial soap, or dish soap can damage or kill the skin in and around the piercing, extending the healing process. The use of Hydrogen peroxide can damage the piercing site more, resulting in irritation of the piercing. The ornament should be periodically cleansed to prevent bacterial plaque accumulation.

==Types==

Lip piercings can be placed anywhere around the mouth, but the surface of the lip is not typically pierced itself, except for horizontal lip piercings and canine bites. Piercings in specific positions have certain names. Monroe piercings, for example, are labret studs worn on the upper lip where Marilyn Monroe had her famous beauty mark. Medusa piercings go through the center of the upper lip (the philtrum), perpendicular to the tissue. Labret piercings are pierced with a labret stud and can pierced in the center or off-center. A variation of this is the lowbret, a lower labret. Vertical labret piercings go through the center of the bottom lip, parallel to the tissue. The variation is called the vertical lowbret, which starts inside the mouth between the lower lip and the teeth and travels straight down, exiting on the lower edge of the jawline. Horizontal lip piercings are very rare, and include a horizontal bar on the lower lip that goes through the lip surface. Another variation of the labret is known as the dahlia piercing. The piercings, placed at or very near the corners of the mouth, are named in reference to the murder of Black Dahlia, in which the victim&#x27;s mouth was cut along the same horizontal line along which these piercings are placed. (See Glasgow smile.)

==History and culture==
Precolumbian cultures of South America historically used lip piercing called Tembetá. Lip piercing continues to be practiced by many people, the most well-known of which are certain African tribes, who wear large decorative lip plates or discs, usually in the lower lip.

In contemporary society, lip piercings are relatively common. In a study among Israeli young-adults, 4.3% had present or past body piercing (not included earlobe, lip or intra-oral piercing), and 5.7%, 6.2% and 15.7% had present or past lip piercing, body tattooing and intra-oral piercing, respectively.

== Health risks and complications ==
Studies have found people with lip piercings to have 4 to 7 times higher risk of gingival recession than people without piercing. Studies also found a higher percentage of dental trauma in people with lip piercings.

<text>Year 301 ([[Roman numerals|CCCI]]) was a common year starting on Wednesday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Postumius and Nepotianus (or, less frequently, year 1054 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 301 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Roman Empire ====
* Caesar Galerius begins a major war against the Carpi and Bastarnae and wins the first of several victories.
* September: Emperor Diocletian issues a reform that revalues the Roman currency.
* November: Diocletian issues his Edict on Maximum Prices, which, rather than halting rampant inflation, causes widespread panic and an increase in inflation. The measure is quickly abandoned.

== Events ==

=== By place ===

==== Roman Empire ====
* Great Persecution: Emperor Diocletian launches the last and largest major persecution of Christians in the Empire. Caesar Galerius and Hierocles are said to have been the instigators. In a series of four edicts published from February 23, 303, to 304, the Christians are forbidden to worship in groups, are made to perform sacrifices, and must surrender sacred texts. Churches are destroyed, and the clergy are arrested en masse. The persecution lasts in some parts of the empire until 313, and thousands of Christians are killed. Those put to death include Agnes of Rome, a 12-year-old Christian girl who has refused marriage and consecrated her virginity to God. Hailed as a martyr, she will be honored as the patron saint of chastity, gardeners, rape victims and virgins.
* September 25 – On a voyage preaching the gospel, Saint Fermin of Pamplona is beheaded in Amiens (Modern day France).
* November 20 – The Augusti Diocletian and Maximian reunite in Rome to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Diocletian&#x27;s accession, which is now treated as a joint anniversary for both emperors. A series of columns in the Roman Forum and a triumphal arch are dedicated to the emperors. The two emperors also agree on a plan of abdication.
* Galerius wins his third victory over the Carpi and is perhaps joined on campaign by Diocletian. The Arch of Galerius is dedicated in Thessaloniki.

<text>The Irish Free State (6 December 192229 December 1937), also known by its Irish name ( , ), was a state established in December 1922 under the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921. The treaty ended the three-year Irish War of Independence between the forces of the Irish Republic – the Irish Republican Army (IRA) – and British Crown forces.

The Free State was established as a dominion of the British Empire. It comprised 26 of the 32 counties of Ireland. Northern Ireland, which was made up of the remaining six counties, exercised its right under the Treaty to opt out of the new state. The Free State government consisted of the Governor-General – the representative of the king – and the Executive Council (cabinet), which replaced both the revolutionary Dáil Government and the Provisional Government set up under the Treaty. W. T. Cosgrave, who had led both of these administrations since August 1922, became the first President of the Executive Council (prime minister). The Oireachtas or legislature consisted of Dáil Éireann (the lower house) and Seanad Éireann (the upper house), also known as the Senate. Members of the Dáil were required to take an Oath of Allegiance to the Constitution of the Free State and to declare fidelity to the king. The oath was a key issue for opponents of the Treaty, who refused to take it and therefore did not take their seats. Pro-Treaty members, who formed Cumann na nGaedheal in 1923, held an effective majority in the Dáil from 1922 to 1927 and thereafter ruled as a minority government until 1932.

In 1931, with the passage of the Statute of Westminster, the Parliament of the United Kingdom relinquished nearly all of its remaining authority to legislate for the Free State and the other dominions. This had the effect of granting the Free State internationally recognised independence.

In the first months of the Free State, the Irish Civil War was waged between the newly established National Army and the Anti-Treaty IRA, which refused to recognise the state. The Civil War ended in victory for the government forces, with its opponents dumping their arms in May 1923. The Anti-Treaty political party, Sinn Féin, refused to take its seats in the Dáil, leaving the relatively small Labour Party as the only opposition party. In 1926, when Sinn Féin president Éamon de Valera failed to have this policy reversed, he resigned from Sinn Féin and led most of its membership into a new party, Fianna Fáil, which entered the Dáil following the 1927 general election. It formed the government after the 1932 general election, when it became the largest party.

De Valera abolished the oath of allegiance and embarked on an economic war with the UK. In 1937, he drafted a new constitution, which was adopted by a plebiscite in July of that year. The Free State came to an end with the coming into force of the new constitution on 29 December 1937, when the state took the name &quot;Ireland&quot;.

==Background==
The Easter Rising of 1916 and its aftermath caused a profound shift in public opinion towards the republican cause in Ireland. In the December 1918 General Election, the republican Sinn Féin party won a large majority of the Irish seats in the British parliament: 73 of the 105 constituencies returned Sinn Féin members (25 uncontested). The elected Sinn Féin MPs, rather than take their seats at Westminster, set up their own assembly, known as Dáil Éireann (Assembly of Ireland). It affirmed the formation of an Irish Republic and passed a Declaration of Independence. The subsequent War of Independence, fought between the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and British security forces, continued until July 1921 when a truce came into force. By this time the Parliament of Northern Ireland had opened, established under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, presenting the republican movement with a &quot;fait accompli&quot; and guaranteeing the British presence in Ireland. In October negotiations opened in London between members of the British government and members of the Dáil, culminating in the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty on 6 December 1921.

 The Treaty allowed for the creation of a separate state to be known as the Irish Free State, with dominion status, within the then British Empire—a status equivalent to Canada. The Parliament of Northern Ireland could, by presenting an address to the king, opt not to be included in the Free State, in which case a Boundary Commission would be established to determine where the boundary between them should lie. Members of the parliament of the Free State would be required to take an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the Free State and to declare that they would be &quot;faithful&quot; to the king (a modification of the oath taken in other dominions).

The Dáil ratified the Treaty on 7 January 1922, causing a split in the republican movement. A Provisional Government was formed, with Michael Collins as chairman.

The Irish Free State was established on 6 December 1922, and the Provisional Government became the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, headed by W. T. Cosgrave as President of the Executive Council. The following day, the Commons and the Senate of Northern Ireland passed resolutions &quot;for the express purpose of opting out of the Free State&quot;.

==Governmental and constitutional structures==

The Treaty established that the new state would be a constitutional monarchy, with the Governor-General of the Irish Free State as representative of the Crown. The &quot;Constitution of the Irish Free State&quot; made more detailed provision for the state&#x27;s system of government, with a three-tier parliament, called the Oireachtas, made up of the king and two houses, Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann (the Irish Senate).

Executive authority was vested in the king, with the Governor-General as his representative. He appointed a cabinet called the Executive Council to &quot;aid and advise&quot; him. The Executive Council was presided over by a prime minister called the President of the Executive Council. In practice, most of the real power was exercised by the Executive Council, as the Governor-General was almost always bound to act on the advice of the Executive Council.

===Representative of the Crown===

The office of Governor-General of the Irish Free State replaced the previous Lord Lieutenant, who had headed English and British administrations in Ireland since the Middle Ages. Governors-General were appointed by the king initially on the advice of the British Government, but with the consent of the Irish Government. From 1927, the Irish Government alone had the power to advise the king whom to appoint.

===Oath of Allegiance===
As with all dominions, provision was made for an Oath of Allegiance. Within dominions, such oaths were taken by parliamentarians personally towards the monarch. The Irish Oath of Allegiance was fundamentally different. It had two elements; the first, an &quot;oath to the Free State, as by law established&quot;, the second part a promise of &quot;fidelity, to His Majesty, King George V, his heirs and successors&quot;. That second fidelity element, however, was qualified in two ways. It was to the King &quot;in&quot; Ireland, not specifically to the King of the United Kingdom. Secondly, it was to the king explicitly in his role as part of the Treaty settlement, not in terms of pre-1922 British rule. The Oath itself came from a combination of three sources, and was largely the work of Michael Collins in the Treaty negotiations. It came in part from a draft oath suggested prior to the negotiations by President de Valera. Other sections were taken by Collins directly from the Oath of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), of which he was the secret head. In its structure, it was also partially based on the form and structure used for &#x27;Dominion status&#x27;. 

Although &#x27;a new departure&#x27;, and notably indirect in its reference to the monarchy, it was criticised by nationalists and republicans for making any reference to the Crown, the claim being that it &quot;was&quot; a direct oath to the Crown, a fact arguably incorrect by an examination of its wording, but in 1922 Ireland and beyond, many argued that the fact remained that as a dominion the King (and therefore the British) was still Head of State and that was the practical reality that influenced public debate on the issue. The Free State was not a republic. The Oath became a key issue in the resulting Irish Civil War that divided the pro and anti-treaty sides in 1922–23.

==Irish Civil War==
The compromises contained in the agreement caused the civil war in the 26 counties in June 1922 – April 1923, in which the pro-Treaty Provisional Government defeated the anti-Treaty Republican forces. The latter were led, nominally, by Éamon de Valera, who had resigned as President of the Republic on the treaty&#x27;s ratification. His resignation outraged some of his own supporters, notably Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly, the main Sinn Féin organiser. On resigning, he then sought re-election but was defeated two days later on a vote of 60–58. The pro-Treaty Arthur Griffith followed as President of the Irish Republic. Michael Collins was chosen at a meeting of the members elected to sit in the House of Commons of Southern Ireland (a body set up under the Government of Ireland Act 1920) to become Chairman of the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State in accordance with the Treaty. The general election in June gave overwhelming support for the pro-Treaty parties. W. T. Cosgrave&#x27;s Crown-appointed Provisional Government effectively subsumed Griffith&#x27;s republican administration with the death of both Collins and Griffith in August 1922.

==&quot;Freedom to achieve freedom&quot;==
===Governance===
The following were the principal parties of government of the Free State between 1922 and 1937:
* Cumann na nGaedheal under W. T. Cosgrave (1922–32)
* Fianna Fáil under Éamon de Valera (1932–37)

===Constitutional evolution===

Michael Collins described the Treaty as &quot;the freedom to achieve freedom&quot;. In practice, the Treaty offered most of the symbols and powers of independence. These included a functioning, if disputed, parliamentary democracy with its own executive, judiciary and written constitution which could be changed by the Oireachtas. Although an Irish republic had not been on offer, the Treaty still afforded Ireland more internal independence than it had possessed in over 400 years, and far more autonomy than had ever been hoped for by those who had advocated for Home Rule.

However, a number of conditions existed:

* The king remained king &quot;in&quot; Ireland;
* Britain retained the so-called strategic Treaty Ports on Ireland&#x27;s south and north-west coasts which were to remain occupied by the Royal Navy; 
* Prior to the passage of the Statute of Westminster, the UK government continued to have a role in Irish governance. Officially the representative of the king, the Governor-General also received instructions from the British Government on his use of the Royal Assent, namely a Bill passed by the Dáil and Seanad could be Granted Assent (signed into law), Withheld (not signed, pending later approval) or Denied (vetoed). The letters patent to the first Governor-General, Tim Healy, explicitly named Bills that were to be rejected if passed by the Dáil and Seanad, such as any attempt to abolish the Oath. In the event, no such Bills were ever introduced, so the issue was moot.

* As with the other dominions, the Free State had a status of association with the UK rather than being completely legally independent from it. However, the meaning of &#x27;Dominion status&#x27; changed radically during the 1920s, starting with the Chanak crisis in 1922 and quickly followed by the directly negotiated Halibut Treaty of 1923. The 1926 Imperial Conference declared the equality [including the UK] of all member states of the Commonwealth. The Conference also led to a reform of the king&#x27;s title, given effect by the &quot;Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927&quot;, which changed the king&#x27;s royal title so that it took account of the fact that there was no longer a United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The king adopted the following style by which he would be known in all of his empire: &quot;By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India&quot;. That was the king&#x27;s title in Ireland just as elsewhere in his empire.
* In the conduct of external relations, the Free State tried to push the boundaries of its status as a Dominion. It &#x27;accepted&#x27; credentials from international ambassadors to Ireland, something no other dominion up to then had done. It registered the treaty with the League of Nations as an international document, over the objections of the United Kingdom, which saw it as a mere &quot;internal&quot; document between a dominion and the United Kingdom. Entitlement of citizenship of the Free State was defined in the Irish Free State Constitution, but the status of that citizenship was contentious. One of the first projects of the Free State was the design and production of the Great Seal of Saorstát Éireann which was carried out on behalf of the Government by Hugh Kennedy.

The Statute of Westminster of 1931, embodying a decision of an Imperial Conference, enabled each dominion to enact new legislation or to change any extant legislation, without resorting to any role for the British Parliament that may have enacted the original legislation in the past. It also removed Westminster&#x27;s authority to legislate for the Dominions, except with the express request and consent of the relevant Dominion&#x27;s parliament. This change had the effect of making the dominions, including the Free State, &quot;de jure&quot; independent nations—thus fulfilling Collins&#x27; vision of having &quot;the freedom to achieve freedom&quot;.

The Free State symbolically marked these changes in two mould-breaking moves soon after winning internationally recognised independence:
* It sought, and got, the king&#x27;s acceptance to have an Irish minister, to the complete exclusion of British ministers, formally advise the king in the exercise of his powers and functions as king in the Irish Free State. This gave the President of the Executive Council the right to directly advise the king in his capacity as His Majesty&#x27;s Irish Prime Minister. Two examples of this are the signing of a treaty between the Irish Free State and the Portuguese Republic in 1931, and the act recognising the abdication of King Edward VIII in 1936 separately from the recognition by the British Parliament.
* The unprecedented replacement of the use of the Great Seal of the Realm and its replacement by the Great Seal of Saorstát Éireann, which the king awarded to the Irish Free State in 1931. (The Irish Seal consisted of a picture of King George V enthroned on one side, with the Irish state harp and the words &quot;Saorstát Éireann&quot; on the reverse. It is now on display in the Irish National Museum, Collins Barracks in Dublin.)

When Éamon de Valera became President of the Executive Council (prime minister) in 1932 he described Cosgrave&#x27;s ministers&#x27; achievements simply. Having read the files, he told his son, Vivion, &quot;they were magnificent, son&quot;.

The Statute of Westminster allowed de Valera, on becoming President of the Executive Council (February 1932), to go even further. With no ensuing restrictions on his policies, he abolished the Oath of Allegiance (which Cosgrave intended to do had he won the 1932 general election), the Seanad, university representation in the Dáil, and appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

One major policy error occurred in 1936 when he attempted to use the abdication of King Edward VIII to abolish the crown and governor-general in the Free State with the &quot;Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act&quot;. He was advised by senior law officers and other constitutional experts that, as the crown and governor-generalship existed separately from the constitution in a vast number of acts, charters, orders-in-council, and letters patent, they both still existed. A second bill, the &quot;Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1937&quot; was quickly introduced to repeal the necessary elements. De Valera retroactively dated the second act back to December 1936.

===Currency===
The new state continued to use the Pound sterling from its inception; there is no reference in the Treaty or in either of the enabling Acts to currency. Nonetheless, and within a few years, the Dáil passed the Coinage Act, 1926 (which provided for a &quot;Saorstát&quot; [Free State] coinage) and the Currency Act, 1927 (which provided &quot;inter alia&quot; for banknotes of the Saorstát pound). The new Saorstát pound was defined by the 1927 Act to have exactly the same weight and fineness of gold as was the sovereign at the time, making the new currency pegged at 1:1 with sterling. The State circulated its new national coinage in 1928, marked &quot;Saorstát Éireann&quot; and a national series of banknotes. British coinage remained acceptable in the Free State at an equal rate. In 1937, when the Free State was superseded by Ireland (&quot;Éire&quot;), the pound became known as the &quot;Irish pound&quot; and the coins were marked &quot;Éire&quot;.

== Foreign policy ==
Ireland joined the League of Nations on 10 September 1923. It would also participate in the Olympics sending its first team to the 1924 Summer Olympics held in Paris. They would send further teams to the 1928 Summer Olympics and the 1932 Summer Olympics.
According to Gerard Keown, by 1932 much had been achieved in the quest for an independent foreign policy. The Irish Free State was an established element in the European system and a member of the League of Nations. It had blazed a trail in asserting the rights of the dominions to their own foreign policy, in the process establishing full diplomatic relations with the United States, France, Belgium, Germany, and the Holy See. It was concluding its own political and commercial treaties and using the apparatus of international relations to pursue its interests. It had received the accolade of election to a non-permanent seat on the council of the League of Nations and asserted its full equality with Britain and the other dominions within the Commonwealth.

By contrast, the military was drastically reduced in size and scope, with its budget cut by 82% from 1924 to 1929. The active duty forces were reduced from 28,000 men to 7,000. Cooperation with London was minimal.

==Demographics==
===Birth rate===
According to one report, in 1924, shortly after the Free State&#x27;s establishment, the new dominion had the &quot;lowest birth-rate in the world&quot;. The report noted that amongst countries for which statistics were available (Ceylon, Chile, Japan, Spain, South Africa, the Netherlands, Canada, Germany, Australia, the United States, Britain, New Zealand, Finland, and the Irish Free State), Ceylon had the highest birth rate at 40.8 per 1,000 while the Irish Free State had a birth rate of just 18.6 per 1,000.

=== Cultural outlook ===
Irish society during this period was extremely Roman Catholic, with Roman Catholic thinkers promoting anti-capitalist, anti-communist, anti-Protestant, anti-Masonic, and antisemitic views in Irish society. Through the works of priests such as Edward Cahill, Richard Devane, and Denis Fahey, Irish society saw capitalism, individualism, communism, private banking, the promotion of alcohol, contraceptives, divorce, and abortion as the pursuits of the old &#x27;Protestant-elite&#x27; and Jews, with their efforts combined through the Freemasons. Denis Fahey described Ireland as &quot;the third most Masonic country in the world&quot; and saw this alleged order as contrary to the creation of an independent Irish State.

==After the Irish Free State==
===1937 Constitution===
In 1937 the Fianna Fáil government presented a draft of an entirely new Constitution to Dáil Éireann. An amended version of the draft document was subsequently approved by the Dáil. A plebiscite was held on 1 July 1937, which was the same day as the 1937 general election, when a relatively narrow majority approved it. The new Constitution of Ireland (&quot;Bunreacht na hÉireann&quot;) repealed the 1922 Constitution, and came into effect on 29 December 1937.

The state was named Ireland (Éire in the Irish language), and a new office of President of Ireland was instituted in place of the Governor-General of the Irish Free State. The new constitution claimed jurisdiction over all of Ireland while recognising that legislation would not apply in Northern Ireland (see Articles 2 and 3). Articles 2 and 3 were reworded in 1998 to remove jurisdictional claim over the entire island and to recognise that &quot;a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island&quot;.

With regard to religion, a section of Article 44 included the following:

 Following a referendum, this section was removed in 1973. After the setting up of the Free State in 1923, unionism in the south largely came to an end.

The 1937 Constitution saw a notable ideological slant to the changes of the framework of the State in such a way as to create one that appeared to be distinctly Irish. This was done so by implementing corporatist policies (based on the concepts of the Roman Catholic Church, as Catholicism was perceived to be deeply imbedded with the perception of Irish identity). A clear example of this is the model of the reconstituted Seanad Éireann (the Senate), which operates based on a system of vocational panels, along with a list of appointed nominating industry bodies, a corporatist concept (seen in Pope Pius XI&#x27;s 1931 encyclical Quadragesimo anno). Furthermore, Ireland&#x27;s main political parties; Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Labour, all had an inherently corporatist outlook. The government was the subject of intense lobbying by leading Church figures throughout the 1930s in calling for reform of the State&#x27;s framework. Much of this was reflected in the new 1937 Constitution.

<text>Year 304 ([[Roman numerals|CCCIV]]) was a leap year starting on Saturday of the Julian calendar. It was known in the Roman Empire as the Year of the Consulship of Diocletian and Maximian (or, less frequently, year 1057 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 304 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
=== By place ===

==== Roman Empire ====
* Caesar Galerius, perhaps accompanied by Emperor Diocletian, wins his fourth and final victory over the Carpi. Many of the surviving Carpi and Bastarnae are resettled in the Roman Empire, where they are split up. The Bastarnae are not attested after this time, and the Carpi are attested only once more in the 310s.
* Diocletian, while inspecting the Danube border, becomes seriously ill.
* Caesar Constantius I besieges a Germanic raiding force on an island in the Rhine and forces their surrender.

==== Asia ====
* Sixteen Kingdoms: The Xiongnu establishes the Han-Zhao state under Liu Yuan, often seen as the start of the Upheaval of the Five Barbarians. 
* Cheng-Han earns its independence from Jin dynasty.
* Biryu becomes king of the Korean kingdom of Baekje.

===By topic===

====Religion====
* October 25 – Pope Marcellinus dies at Rome after an 8-year reign. The papal throne will remain vacant until 308.

<text>An endospore is a dormant, tough, and non-reproductive structure produced by some bacteria in the phylum Bacillota. The name &quot;endospore&quot; is suggestive of a spore or seed-like form (&quot;endo&quot; means &#x27;within&#x27;), but it is not a true spore (i.e., not an offspring). It is a stripped-down, dormant form to which the bacterium can reduce itself. Endospore formation is usually triggered by a lack of nutrients, and usually occurs in Gram-positive bacteria. In endospore formation, the bacterium divides within its cell wall, and one side then engulfs the other. Endospores enable bacteria to lie dormant for extended periods, even centuries. There are many reports of spores remaining viable over 10,000 years, and revival of spores millions of years old has been claimed. There is one report of viable spores of &quot;Bacillus marismortui&quot; in salt crystals approximately 25 million years old. When the environment becomes more favorable, the endospore can reactivate itself into a vegetative state. Most types of bacteria cannot change to the endospore form. Examples of bacterial species that can form endospores include &quot;Bacillus cereus&quot;, &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot;, &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot;, &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot;, and &quot;Clostridium tetani&quot;. Endospore formation is not found among &quot;Archaea&quot;.

The endospore consists of the bacterium&#x27;s DNA, ribosomes and large amounts of dipicolinic acid. Dipicolinic acid is a spore-specific chemical that appears to help in the ability for endospores to maintain dormancy. This chemical accounts for up to 10% of the spore&#x27;s dry weight.

Endospores can survive without nutrients. They are resistant to ultraviolet radiation, desiccation, high temperature, extreme freezing and chemical disinfectants. Thermo-resistant endospores were first hypothesized by Ferdinand Cohn after studying &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; growth on cheese after boiling the cheese. His notion of spores being the reproductive mechanism for the growth was a large blow to the previous suggestions of spontaneous generation. Astrophysicist Steinn Sigurdsson said &quot;There are viable bacterial spores that have been found that are 40 million years old on Earth—and we know they&#x27;re very hardened to radiation.&quot; Common antibacterial agents that work by destroying vegetative cell walls do not affect endospores. Endospores are commonly found in soil and water, where they may survive for long periods of time. A variety of different microorganisms form &quot;spores&quot; or &quot;cysts&quot;, but the endospores of low G+C gram-positive bacteria are by far the most resistant to harsh conditions.

Some classes of bacteria can turn into exospores, also known as microbial cysts, instead of endospores. Exospores and endospores are two kinds of &quot;hibernating&quot; or dormant stages seen in some classes of microorganisms.

==Life cycle of bacteria==
The bacterial life cycle does not necessarily include sporulation. Sporulation is usually triggered by adverse environmental conditions, so as to help the survival of the bacterium. Endospores exhibit no signs of life and can thus be described as cryptobiotic. Endospores retain viability indefinitely and they can germinate into vegetative cells under the appropriate conditions. Endospores have survived thousands of years until environmental stimuli trigger germination. They have been characterized as the most durable cells produced in nature.

==Structure==

Bacteria produce a single endospore internally. The spore is sometimes surrounded by a thin covering known as the exosporium, which overlies the &quot;spore coat&quot;. The spore coat, which acts like a sieve that excludes large toxic molecules like lysozyme, is resistant to many toxic molecules and may also contain enzymes that are involved in germination. In &quot;Bacillus subtilus&quot; endospores, the spore coat is estimated to contain more than 70 coat proteins, which are organized into an inner and an outer coat layer. The X-ray diffraction pattern of purified &quot;B. subtilis&quot; endospores indicates the presence of a component with a regular periodic structure, which Kadota and Iijima speculated might be formed from a keratin-like protein. However, after further studies this group concluded that the structure of the spore coat protein was different from keratin. When the &quot;B. subtilis&quot; genome was sequenced, no ortholog of human keratin was detected. The &quot;cortex&quot; lies beneath the spore coat and consists of peptidoglycan. The &quot;core wall&quot; lies beneath the cortex and surrounds the protoplast or &quot;core&quot; of the endospore. The core contains the spore chromosomal DNA which is encased in chromatin-like proteins known as SASPs (small acid-soluble spore proteins), that protect the spore DNA from UV radiation and heat. The core also contains normal cell structures, such as ribosomes and other enzymes, but is not metabolically active.

Up to 20% of the dry weight of the endospore consists of calcium dipicolinate within the core, which is thought to stabilize the DNA. Dipicolinic acid could be responsible for the heat resistance of the spore, and calcium may aid in resistance to heat and oxidizing agents. However, mutants resistant to heat but lacking dipicolinic acid have been isolated, suggesting other mechanisms contributing to heat resistance are also at work. Small acid-soluble proteins (SASPs) are found in endospores. These proteins tightly bind and condense the DNA, and are in part responsible for resistance to UV light and DNA-damaging chemicals.

Visualising endospores under light microscopy can be difficult due to the impermeability of the endospore wall to dyes and stains. While the rest of a bacterial cell may stain, the endospore is left colourless. To combat this, a special stain technique called a Moeller stain is used. That allows the endospore to show up as red, while the rest of the cell stains blue. Another staining technique for endospores is the Schaeffer-Fulton stain, which stains endospores green and bacterial bodies red. The arrangement of spore layers is as follows:
* Exosporium
* Spore coat
* Spore cortex
* Core wall

==Location==
The position of the endospore differs among bacterial species and is useful in identification. The main types within the cell are terminal, subterminal, and centrally placed endospores. Terminal endospores are seen at the poles of cells, whereas central endospores are more or less in the middle. Subterminal endospores are those between these two extremes, usually seen far enough towards the poles but close enough to the center so as not to be considered either terminal or central. Lateral endospores are seen occasionally.

Examples of bacteria having terminal endospores include &quot;Clostridium tetani&quot;, the pathogen that causes the disease tetanus. Bacteria having a centrally placed endospore include &quot;Bacillus cereus&quot;. Sometimes the endospore can be so large the cell can be distended around the endospore. This is typical of &quot;Clostridium tetani&quot;.

==Formation and destruction==
Under conditions of starvation, especially the lack of carbon and nitrogen sources, a single endospore forms within some of the bacteria through a process called sporulation.

When a bacterium detects environmental conditions are becoming unfavourable it may start the process of endosporulation, which takes about eight hours. The DNA is replicated and a membrane wall known as a &quot;spore septum&quot; begins to form between it and the rest of the cell. The plasma membrane of the cell surrounds this wall and pinches off to leave a double membrane around the DNA, and the developing structure is now known as a forespore. Calcium dipicolinate, the calcium salt of dipicolinic acid, is incorporated into the forespore during this time. The dipicolinic acid helps stabilize the proteins and DNA in the endospore. Next the peptidoglycan cortex forms between the two layers and the bacterium adds a spore coat to the outside of the forespore. In the final stages of endospore formation the newly forming endospore is dehydrated and allowed to mature before being released from the mother cell. The cortex is what makes the endospore so resistant to temperature. The cortex contains an inner membrane known as the core. The inner membrane that surrounds this core leads to the endospore&#x27;s resistance against UV light and harsh chemicals that would normally destroy microbes. Sporulation is now complete, and the mature endospore will be released when the surrounding vegetative cell is degraded.

Endospores are resistant to most agents that would normally kill the vegetative cells they formed from. Unlike persister cells, endospores are the result of a morphological differentiation process triggered by nutrient limitation (starvation) in the environment; endosporulation is initiated by quorum sensing within the &quot;starving&quot; population.Most disinfectants such as household cleaning products, alcohols, quaternary ammonium compounds and detergents have little effect on endospores. However, sterilant alkylating agents such as ethylene oxide (ETO), and 10% bleach are effective against endospores. To kill most anthrax spores, standard household bleach (with 10% sodium hypochlorite) must be in contact with the spores for at least several minutes; a very small proportion of spores can survive longer than 10 minutes in such a solution. Higher concentrations of bleach are not more effective, and can cause some types of bacteria to aggregate and thus survive.

While significantly resistant to heat and radiation, endospores can be destroyed by burning or by autoclaving at a temperature exceeding the boiling point of water, 100 °C. Endospores are able to survive at 100 °C for hours, although the larger the number of hours the fewer that will survive. An indirect way to destroy them is to place them in an environment that reactivates them to their vegetative state. They will germinate within a day or two with the right environmental conditions, and then the vegetative cells, not as hardy as endospores, can be straightforwardly destroyed. This indirect method is called Tyndallization. It was the usual method for a while in the late 19th century before the introduction of inexpensive autoclaves. Prolonged exposure to ionising radiation, such as x-rays and gamma rays, will also kill most endospores.

The endospores of certain types of (typically non-pathogenic) bacteria, such as &quot;Geobacillus stearothermophilus&quot;, are used as probes to verify that an autoclaved item has been rendered truly sterile: a small capsule containing the spores is put into the autoclave with the items; after the cycle the content of the capsule is cultured to check if anything will grow from it. If nothing will grow, then the spores were destroyed and the sterilization was successful.

In hospitals, endospores on delicate invasive instruments such as endoscopes are killed by low-temperature, and non-corrosive, ethylene oxide sterilizers. Ethylene oxide is the only low-temperature sterilant to stop outbreaks on these instruments. In contrast, &quot;high level disinfection&quot; does not kill endospores but is used for instruments such as a colonoscope that do not enter sterile bodily cavities. This latter method uses only warm water, enzymes, and detergents.

Bacterial endospores are resistant to antibiotics, most disinfectants, and physical agents such as radiation, boiling, and drying. The impermeability of the spore coat is thought to be responsible for the endospore&#x27;s resistance to chemicals. The heat resistance of endospores is due to a variety of factors:
* Calcium dipicolinate, abundant within the endospore, may stabilize and protect the endospore&#x27;s DNA.
* Small acid-soluble proteins (SASPs) saturate the endospore&#x27;s DNA and protect it from heat, drying, chemicals, and radiation. They also function as a carbon and energy source for the development of a vegetative bacterium during germination.
* The cortex may osmotically remove water from the interior of the endospore and the dehydration that results is thought to be very important in the endospore&#x27;s resistance to heat and radiation.
* Finally, DNA repair enzymes contained within the endospore are able to repair damaged DNA during germination.

== Reactivation ==

Reactivation of the endospore occurs when conditions are more favourable and involves &quot;activation&quot;, &quot;germination&quot;, and &quot;outgrowth&quot;. Even if an endospore is located in plentiful nutrients, it may fail to germinate unless activation has taken place. This may be triggered by heating the endospore. Germination involves the dormant endospore starting metabolic activity and thus breaking hibernation. It is commonly characterised by rupture or absorption of the spore coat, swelling of the endospore, an increase in metabolic activity, and loss of resistance to environmental stress.

Outgrowth follows germination and involves the core of the endospore manufacturing new chemical components and exiting the old spore coat to develop into a fully functional vegetative bacterial cell, which can divide to produce more cells.

Endospores possess five times more sulfur than vegetative cells. This excess sulfur is concentrated in spore coats as an amino acid, cysteine. It is believed that the macromolecule accountable for maintaining the dormant state has a protein coat rich in cystine, stabilized by S-S linkages. A reduction in these linkages has the potential to change the tertiary structure, causing the protein to unfold. This conformational change in the protein is thought to be responsible for exposing active enzymatic sites necessary for endospore germination.

Endospores can stay dormant for a very long time. For instance, endospores were found in the tombs of the Egyptian pharaohs. When placed in appropriate medium, under appropriate conditions, they were able to be reactivated. In 1995, Raul Cano of California Polytechnic State University found bacterial spores in the gut of a fossilized bee trapped in amber from a tree in the Dominican Republic. The bee fossilized in amber was dated to being about 25 million years old. The spores germinated when the amber was cracked open and the material from the gut of the bee was extracted and placed in nutrient medium. After the spores were analyzed by microscopy, it was determined that the cells were very similar to &quot;Lysinibacillus sphaericus&quot; which is found in bees in the Dominican Republic today.

==Importance==

As a simplified model for cellular differentiation, the molecular details of endospore formation have been extensively studied, specifically in the model organism &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;. These studies have contributed much to our understanding of the regulation of gene expression, transcription factors, and the sigma factor subunits of RNA polymerase.

Endospores of the bacterium &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot; were used in the 2001 anthrax attacks. The powder found in contaminated postal letters consisted of anthrax endospores. This intentional distribution led to 22 known cases of anthrax (11 inhalation and 11 cutaneous). The case fatality rate among those patients with inhalation anthrax was 45% (5/11). The six other individuals with inhalation anthrax and all the individuals with cutaneous anthrax recovered. Had it not been for antibiotic therapy, many more might have been stricken.

According to WHO veterinary documents, &quot;B. anthracis&quot; sporulates when it sees oxygen instead of the carbon dioxide present in mammal blood; this signals to the bacteria that it has reached the end of the animal, and an inactive dispersable morphology is useful.

Sporulation requires the presence of free oxygen. In the natural situation, this means the vegetative cycles occur within the low oxygen environment of the infected host and, within the host, the organism is exclusively in the vegetative form. Once outside the host, sporulation commences upon exposure to the air and the spore forms are essentially the exclusive phase in the environment.

===Biotechnology===
&quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; spores are useful for the expression of recombinant proteins and in particular for the surface display of peptides and proteins as a tool for fundamental and applied research in the fields of microbiology, biotechnology and vaccination.

<text>Theodore the Studite (; 759–826), also known as Theodorus Studita and Saint Theodore of Stoudios/Studium, was a Byzantine Greek monk and abbot of the Stoudios Monastery in Constantinople. He played a major role in the revivals both of Byzantine monasticism and of classical literary genres in Byzantium. He is known as a zealous opponent of iconoclasm, one of several conflicts that set him at odds with both emperor and patriarch. Throughout his life he maintained letter correspondences with many important political and cultural figures of the Byzantine empire; this included many women, such as the composer and nun Kassia, who was much influenced by his teachings.

==Biography==

===Family and childhood===
Theodore was born in Constantinople in 759. He was the oldest son of Photeinos, an important financial official in the palace bureaucracy, and Theoktiste, herself the offspring of a distinguished Constantinopolitan family. The brother of Theoktiste, Theodore&#x27;s uncle Platon, was an important official in the imperial financial administration. The family therefore controlled a significant portion, if not all, of the imperial financial administration during the reign of Constantine V (r. 741–775). Theodore had two younger brothers (Joseph, later Archbishop of Thessalonica, and Euthymios) and one sister, whose name we do not know.

It has often been assumed that Theodore&#x27;s family belonged to the iconodule party during the first period of Byzantine Iconoclasm. There is however no evidence to support this, and their high position in the imperial bureaucracy of the time renders any openly iconodule position highly unlikely. Furthermore, when Platon left his office and entered the priesthood in 759, he was ordained by an abbot who, if he was not actively iconoclastic himself, at the very least offered no resistance to the iconoclastic policies of Constantine V. The family as a whole was most likely indifferent to the question of icons during this period.

According to the later hagiographical literature, Theodore received an education befitting his family&#x27;s station and from the age of seven was instructed by a private tutor, eventually concentrating in particular on theology. It is however not clear that these opportunities were available to even the most well-placed Byzantine families of the eighth century, and it is possible that Theodore was at least partially an autodidact.

===Early monastic career===
Following the death of Emperor Leo IV (r. 775–780) in 780, Theodore&#x27;s uncle Platon, who had lived as a monk in the Symbola Monastery in Bithynia since 759, visited Constantinople, and persuaded the entire family of his sister, Theoktiste, to likewise take monastic vows. Theodore, together with his father and brothers, sailed back to Bithynia with Platon in 781, where they set about transforming the family estate into a religious establishment, which became known as the Sakkudion Monastery. Platon became abbot of the new foundation, and Theodore was his &quot;right hand.&quot; The two sought to order the monastery according to the writings of Basil of Caesarea.

During the period of the regency of Eirene, Abbot Platon emerged as a supporter of the Patriarch Tarasios, and was a member of Tarasios&#x27;s iconodule party at the Second Council of Nicaea, where the veneration of icons was declared orthodox. Shortly thereafter Tarasios himself ordained Theodore as a priest. In 794, Theodore became abbot of the Sakkudion Monastery, while Platon withdrew from the daily operation of the monastery and dedicated himself to silence.

===Conflict with Constantine VI===
Also in 794, Emperor Constantine VI (r. 776–797) decided to separate from his first wife, Maria of Amnia, and to marry Maria&#x27;s &quot;kubikularia&quot; (Lady-in-waiting), Theodote, a cousin of Theodore the Studite. Although the Patriarch may initially have resisted this development, as a divorce without proof of adultery on the part of the wife could be construed as illegal, he ultimately gave way. The marriage of Constantine and Theodote was celebrated in 795, although not by the patriarch, as was normal, but by a certain Joseph, a priest of Hagia Sophia.

A somewhat obscure chain of events followed (the so-called &quot;Moechian controversy,&quot; from the Greek &quot;moichos&quot;, &quot;adulterer&quot;), in which Theodore initiated a protest against the marriage from the Sakkudion Monastery, and appears to have demanded the excommunication, not only of the priest Joseph, but also of all who had received communion from him, which, as Joseph was a priest of the imperial church, included implicitly the emperor and his court. This demand had no official weight, however, and Constantine appears to have attempted to make peace with Theodore and Platon (who, on account of his marriage, were now his relatives), inviting them to visit him during a sojourn at the imperial baths of Prusa in Bithynia. In the event neither appeared.

As a result, imperial troops were sent to the Sakkudion Monastery, and the community was dispersed. Theodore was flogged, and, together with ten other monks, banished to Thessaloniki, while Platon was imprisoned in Constantinople. The monks arrived in Thessaloniki in March 797, but did not remain for long; in August of the same year Constantine VI was blinded and overthrown, and his mother Irene, the new empress, lifted the exile.

===Abbot of the Studites===

Following the accession of Irene, the priest Joseph was stripped of his office, and Theodoros was received in the imperial palace. The monks then returned to the Sakkudion Monastery, but were forced back to the capital in either 797 or 798 on account of an Arab raid on Bithynia. At this time, Irene offered Theodore the leadership of the ancient Stoudios Monastery in Constantinople, which he accepted. Theodore then set about building various workshops within the monastery to guarantee autarky, constructing a library and a scriptorium, and restoring and decorating the church. He also composed a series of poems on the duties of the various members of the community, which were likely inscribed and displayed within the monastery. He furthermore composed a rule for the governance of the monastery, and made the Studios community the center of an extensive congregation of dependent monasteries, including the Sakkudion. He maintained contact with these other monasteries above all through his prodigious literary output (letters as well as catechisms), which reached a quantitative peak at this time, and developed a system of messengers that was so elaborate as to resemble a private postal service.

To this period may also date the so-called iconodule epigrams, iambic acrostics composed by Theodore that replaced the &quot;iconoclastic epigrams&quot; which were previously exhibited on the Chalke gate of the Great Palace. It has been suggested that these were commissioned by Irene, as another sign of her good favor toward Theodore, although a commission under Michael I Rangabe (r. 811–813) is also possible; in any case, they were removed in 815 by Leo V the Armenian (r. 813–820) and replaced by new &quot;iconoclastic&quot; verses.

In 806, the Patriarch Tarasios died, and Emperor Nikephoros I (r. 802–811) set about seeking his replacement. It appears likely that Platon at this time put forth Theodore&#x27;s name, but Nikephoros, a layman who held the rank of &quot;asekretis&quot; in the imperial bureaucracy, was chosen instead. The selection of Nikephoros gave rise to an immediate protest on the part of the Studites, and in particular Theodore and Platon, who objected to the elevation of a layman to the patriarchal throne. Theodore and Platon were jailed for 24 days before the Emperor Nikephoros allowed them to return to their congregations.

===Conflict with Nikephoros===
Emperor Nikephoros soon requested that his new patriarch rehabilitate the priest Joseph, who had officiated at the wedding of Constantine and Theodote, possibly because Joseph had aided in the peaceful resolution of the revolt of Bardanes Tourkos. In 806, the Patriarch Nikephoros convened a synod to address the case, at which Theodore was present. The Synod decided to readmit Joseph to the priesthood, a decision to which Theodore did not at the time object.

Therefore, relations between the Studite Abbot and the Patriarch appear to have been initially untroubled, an impression which is reinforced by the choice (806/807) of Theodore&#x27;s brother, Joseph, as Archbishop of Thessaloniki. However, soon after this ordination, perhaps in 808, Theodore began to express his unwillingness to associate with the rehabilitated priest Joseph, or for that matter with anyone else who knowingly associated with him, as he held the rehabilitation to be uncanonical. As in the first dispute over the priest Joseph, the extension of this refusal beyond Joseph to those who associated with him included implicitly the patriarch and the emperor himself.

Early in 808, Theodoros offered in a series of letters to explain his position to the emperor, and furthermore to perform the customary proskynesis at his feet, which offer Nikephoros declined, instead setting off for the summer military campaign. In the winter of the same year, Theodore&#x27;s brother Joseph visited him in Constantinople, but refused to attend the Christmas mass in Hagia Sophia, at which the emperor, the patriarch, and the priest Joseph would have been present. As a result, he was stripped of his archbishopric. At around the same time a small military division was dispatched to the Stoudios Monastery to arrest Theodore, Joseph, and Platon. A synod was then held in January of 809, at which Theodore and his followers were anathematized as schismatic. Theodore, Joseph, and Platon were thereafter banished to the Princes&#x27; Islands: Theodore to Chalke, Joseph to Prote, and Platon to Oxeia.

Theodore maintained an extensive literary activity in exile, writing numerous letters to correspondents including his brother, various Studite monks, influential family members, and even Pope Leo III. He also continued to compose catechisms for the Studite congregation, as well as a number of poems.

===Rehabilitation under Michael I===
In 811, the new emperor Michael I Rangabe called the Studites back from exile. The priest Joseph was once more defrocked, and Theodore was, at least superficially, reconciled with the Patriarch Nikephoros.

There are, however, indications that a certain rivalry between the Studite Abbot and the Patriarch persisted. In 812, Michael I resolved to persecute certain heretics in Phrygia and Lycaonia, namely the Paulicians and the &quot;Athinganoi&quot; (sometimes identified with the Roma). Theodore and Nikephoros were called before the emperor to debate the legality of punishing heresy by death, Theodore arguing against and Nikephoros for. Theodore is said to have won the day.

The second affair concerned a peace treaty proposed by Krum of Bulgaria (r. 803–814), also in 812, according to which the Byzantine and Bulgarian states should exchange refugees. It is likely that Krum sought the return of certain Bulgarians who had betrayed him to the Byzantines. In this instance Theodore argued against the exchange, as it would require that Christians be cast to barbarians, while Nikephoros urged the emperor to accept the treaty. Once more Theodore&#x27;s opinion prevailed, although this time with serious consequences; Krum attacked and took Mesembria in November the same year. Michael led a military campaign against the Bulgarians in 813, which ended in defeat, and as a result he abdicated in July and Leo V was crowned emperor.

On 4 April 814 Theodore&#x27;s uncle Platon died in the Stoudios Monastery after a long illness. Theodore composed a long funeral oration, the &quot;Laudatio Platonis&quot;, which remains one of the most important sources for the history of the family.

===Second Iconoclasm===

At the very beginning of his reign, the emperor Leo V faced a new Bulgarian offensive that reached the walls of Constantinople and ravaged large sections of Thrace. This came to an end with the death of Krum on April 13, 814, and the internal power struggles that followed. However, as the previous 30 years since the approval of icon-veneration at the Synod of 787 had represented for the Byzantines a string of military catastrophes, Leo resolved to reach back to the policies of the more successful Isaurian dynasty. He renamed his son Constantine, thus drawing a parallel to Leo III (r. 717–741) and Constantine V, and beginning in 814 began to discuss with various clerics and senators the possibility of reviving the iconoclastic policy of the Isaurians. This movement met with strong opposition from the Patriarch Nikephoros, who himself gathered a group of bishops and abbots about him and swore them to uphold the veneration of images. The dispute came to a head in a debate between the two parties before the emperor in the Great Palace in early 815, at which Theodore and his brother Joseph were present and took the side of the iconodules. Theodore told the emperor: &quot;Know that though an angel came from heaven itself to pervert us we would not obey him. Far less would we obey you.&quot;

Leo held fast by his plan to revive iconoclasm, and in March 815 the Patrarch Nikephoros was stripped of his office and exiled to Bithynia. At this point Theodore remained in Constantinople, and assumed a leading role in the iconodule opposition. On March 25, Palm Sunday, he commanded his monks to process through the monastery&#x27;s vineyard, holding up icons so that they could be seen over the walls by the neighbors. This provocation elicited only a rebuke from the emperor.

A new patriarch, Theodotos, was selected, and in April a synod was convened in Hagia Sophia, at which iconoclasm was re-introduced as dogma. Theodore composed a series of letters in which he called on &quot;all, near and far,&quot; to revolt against the decision of the synod. Not long thereafter he was exiled by imperial command to a Metopa, a fortress on the eastern shore of Lake Apollonia in Bithynia. Shortly thereafter Leo had Theodore&#x27;s poems removed from the Chalke Gate and replaced by a new set of &quot;iconoclastic&quot; epigrams.

While Theodore was in exile, the leadership of the Studite congregation was assumed by the Abbot Leontios, who for a time adopted the iconoclast position and won over many individual monks to his party. He was, however, eventually won back to the iconodule party. The Studite situation mirrored a general trend, with a number of bishops and abbots at first willing to reach a compromise with the iconoclasts, but then in the years between 816 and 819 renouncing the iconoclast position, a movement that was perhaps motivated by the martyrdom of the Studite monk Thaddaios. It was during this upswell in icondule sentiment that Theodore began to compose his own polemic against the iconoclasts, the &quot;Refutatio&quot;, concentrating in particular on refuting the arguments and criticizing the literary merits of the new iconoclastic epigrams on the Chalke.

Theodore exercised a wide influence during the first year of his exile, primarily through a massive letter-writing campaign. Accordingly, he was transferred in 816 to Boneta, a fortress in the more remote Anatolic theme, whence he nevertheless remained abreast of developments in the capital and maintained a regular correspondence. This continued activity led to an imperial order that Theodore be whipped, which his captors however refused to carry out. In 817, Theodore wrote two letters to Pope Paschal I, which were co-signed by several fellow iconodule abbots, in the first requesting that he summon an anti-iconoclastic Synod; letters to the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Jerusalem, among other &quot;foreign&quot; clerics, followed. As a result, the emperor ordered at least once more that Theodore be flogged, and the command was this time carried out, with the result that Theodore became quite ill. After his recovery Theodore was moved to Smyrna. Early in 821, however, Leo V fell victim to a grisly murder at the altar of the Church of St. Stephen in the imperial palace; Theodore was released from exile shortly thereafter.

===Final years===
Following his release, Theodore made his way back to Constantinople, travelling through north-western Anatolia and meeting with numerous monks and abbots on the way. At the time he appears to have believed that the new emperor, Michael II (r. 820–829), would adopt a pro-icons policy, and he expressed this hope in two letters to Michael. An imperial audience was arranged for a group of iconodule clerics, including Theodore, at which however Michael expressed his intention to &quot;leave the church as he had found it.&quot; The abbots were to be allowed to venerate images if they so wished, as long as they remained outside of Constantinople. Theodore returned to Anatolia, in what seems to have been a sort of self-imposed exile.

Theodore&#x27;s activities in his final years are somewhat difficult to trace. He continued to write numerous letters supporting the use of icons, and appears to have remained an important leader of the opposition to imperial iconoclasm. He was present at a meeting of &quot;more than a hundred&quot; iconodule clerics in 823 or 824, which ended in an argument between the Studites and the host, one Ioannikos, which may have represented a power struggle within the movement. Theodore also spoke against the second marriage of Michael II to the nun Euphrosyne, a daughter of Constantine VI, although in a very moderate fashion, and with none of the passion or effect of the Moechian controversy.

Theodore&#x27;s years of exile, regular fasting, and exceptional exertions had taken their toll, and in 826 he became quite ill. In this year, he dictated his &quot;Testament&quot;, a form of spiritual guidance for the future abbots of the Stoudios monastery, to his disciple Naukratios. He died on 11 November that year, while celebrating mass, apparently in the monastery of Hagios Tryphon on Cape Akritas in Bithynia. Eighteen years later, his remains, along with those of his brother Joseph, were brought back to the Stoudios Monastery, where they were interred beside the grave of their uncle Platon.

==Legacy==
Theodore&#x27;s revival of the Stoudios monastery had a major effect on the later history of Byzantine monasticism. His disciple, Naukratios, recovered control of the monastery after the end of iconoclasm in 842, and throughout the remainder of the ninth century the Studite abbots continued Theodore&#x27;s tradition of opposition to patriarchal and imperial authority. Elements of Theodore&#x27;s &quot;Testament&quot; were incorporated verbatim in the typika of certain early Athonite monasteries. The most important elements of his reform were its emphases on cenobitic (communal) life, manual labor, and a carefully defined administrative hierarchy.

Theodore also built the Stoudios monastery into a major scholarly center, in particular through its library and scriptorium, which certainly surpassed all other contemporary Byzantine ecclesiastical institutions in this regard. Theodore himself was a pivotal figure in the revival of classical literary forms, in particular iambic verse, in Byzantium, and his criticisms of the iconoclastic epigrams drew a connection between literary skill and orthodox faith. After his death the Stoudios monastery continued to be a vital center for Byzantine hymnography and hagiography, as well as for the copying of manuscripts.

Following the &quot;triumph of Orthodoxy&quot; (i.e. the reintroduction of icons) in 843, Theodore became one of the great heroes of the iconodule opposition. There was no formal process of canonization in Byzantium, but Theodore was soon recognized as a saint. In the Latin West, Theodore’s recognition of papal primacy on the basis of his letters to Pope Paschal I was part of what caused him to be formally canonized by the Catholic Church. His feast day is 11 November in the East and 12 November in the West.

==Commentary on Theodore==
As also mentioned by Kirby Page in &quot;Jesus or Christianity&quot;, Charles Loring Brace tells us in &quot;Gesta Christi&quot; that it was not until the 9th century that the first recorded stand against slavery itself was taken by Theodore:
No direct word against slavery, however, came forth from the great Teacher [Jesus Christ]. It was not until the ninth century after, that one of his humble followers, Saint Theodore of Studium (Constantinople), ventured to put forth the command &quot;Thou shalt possess no slave, neither for domestic service nor for the labor of the fields, for man is made in the image of God.&quot;

<text>The fractal transform is a technique invented by Michael Barnsley &quot;et al.&quot; to perform lossy image compression.
This first practical fractal compression system for digital images resembles a vector quantization system using the image itself as the codebook.

== Fractal transform compression ==

Start with a digital image A1.
Downsample it by a factor of 2 to produce image A2.
Now, for each block B1 of 4x4 pixels in A1, find the corresponding block B2 in A2 most similar to B1, and then find the grayscale or RGB offset and gain from A2 to B2.
For each destination block, output the positions of the source blocks and the color offsets and gains.

== Fractal transform decompression ==
Starting with an empty destination image A1, repeat the following algorithm several times:
Downsample A1 down by a factor of 2 to produce image A2. Then copy blocks from A2 to A1 as directed by the compressed data, multiplying by the respective gains and adding the respective color offsets.

This algorithm is guaranteed to converge to an image, and it should appear similar to the original image.
In fact, a slight modification of the decompressor to run at block sizes larger than 4x4 pixels produces a method of stretching images without causing the blockiness or blurriness of traditional linear resampling algorithms.

== Patents ==
The basic patents covering Fractal Image Compression, U.S. Patents 4,941,193, 5,065,447, 5,384,867, 5,416,856, and 5,430,812 appear to be expired.

<doc id="42964" wikidata="Q208391" url="?curid=42964" title="Snell's law">
<text>Snell&#x27;s law (also known as the Snell–Descartes law, the ibn-Sahl law, and the law of refraction) is a formula used to describe the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction, when referring to light or other waves passing through a boundary between two different isotropic media, such as water, glass, or air.
In optics, the law is used in ray tracing to compute the angles of incidence or refraction, and in experimental optics to find the refractive index of a material. The law is also satisfied in meta-materials, which allow light to be bent &quot;backward&quot; at a negative angle of refraction with a negative refractive index.

The law states that, for a given pair of media, the ratio of the sines of angle of incidence (formula_1) and angle of refraction (formula_2) is equal to the refractive index of the second medium with regard to the first (formula_3) which is equal to the ratio of the refractive indices (formula_4) of the two media, or equivalently, to the ratio of the phase velocities (formula_5) in the two media.

:formula_6

The law follows from Fermat&#x27;s principle of least time, which in turn follows from the propagation of light as waves.

==History==
Ptolemy, in Alexandria, Egypt, had found a relationship regarding refraction angles, but it was inaccurate for angles that were not small. Ptolemy was confident he had found an accurate empirical law, partially as a result of slightly altering his data to fit theory (see: confirmation bias). 

The law was eventually named after Snell, although it was first discovered by the Persian scientist Ibn Sahl, at Baghdad court in 984. In the manuscript &quot;On Burning Mirrors and Lenses&quot;, Sahl used the law to derive lens shapes that focus light with no geometric aberration.

Alhazen, in his &quot;Book of Optics&quot; (1021), came close to rediscovering the law of refraction, but he did not take this step.

The law was rediscovered by Thomas Harriot in 1602, who however did not publish his results although he had corresponded with Kepler on this very subject. In 1621, the Dutch astronomer Willebrord Snellius (1580–1626)—Snell—derived a mathematically equivalent form, that remained unpublished during his lifetime. René Descartes independently derived the law using heuristic momentum conservation arguments in terms of sines in his 1637 essay &quot;Dioptrique&quot;, and used it to solve a range of optical problems. Rejecting Descartes&#x27; solution, Pierre de Fermat arrived at the same solution based solely on his principle of least time. Descartes assumed the speed of light was infinite, yet in his derivation of Snell&#x27;s law he also assumed the denser the medium, the greater the speed of light. Fermat supported the opposing assumptions, i.e., the speed of light is finite, and his derivation depended upon the speed of light being slower in a denser medium. Fermat&#x27;s derivation also utilized his invention of adequality, a mathematical procedure equivalent to differential calculus, for finding maxima, minima, and tangents.

In his influential mathematics book &quot;Geometry&quot;, Descartes solves a problem that was worked on by Apollonius of Perga and Pappus of Alexandria. Given n lines L and a point P(L) on each line, find the locus of points Q such that the lengths of the line segments QP(L) satisfy certain conditions. For example, when n = 4, given the lines a, b, c, and d and a point A on a, B on b, and so on, find the locus of points Q such that the product QA*QB equals the product QC*QD. When the lines are not all parallel, Pappus showed that the loci are conics, but when Descartes considered larger n, he obtained cubic and higher degree curves. To show that the cubic curves were interesting, he showed that they arose naturally in optics from Snell&#x27;s law.

According to Dijksterhuis, &quot;In &quot;De natura lucis et proprietate&quot; (1662) Isaac Vossius said that Descartes had seen Snell&#x27;s paper and concocted his own proof. We now know this charge to be undeserved but it has been adopted many times since.&quot; Both Fermat and Huygens repeated this accusation that Descartes had copied Snell. In French, Snell&#x27;s Law is sometimes called &quot;la loi de Descartes&quot; or more frequently &quot;loi de Snell-Descartes&quot;.

In his 1678 &quot;Traité de la Lumière&quot;, Christiaan Huygens showed how Snell&#x27;s law of sines could be explained by, or derived from, the wave nature of light, using what we have come to call the Huygens–Fresnel principle.

With the development of modern optical and electromagnetic theory, the ancient Snell&#x27;s law was brought into a new stage. In 1962, Nicolaas Bloembergen showed that at the boundary of nonlinear medium, the Snell&#x27;s law should be written in a general form. In 2008 and 2011, plasmonic metasurfaces were also demonstrated to change the reflection and refraction directions of light beam.

== Explanation ==

Snell&#x27;s law is used to determine the direction of light rays through refractive media with varying indices of refraction. The indices of refraction of the media, labeled formula_7, formula_8 and so on, are used to represent the factor by which a light ray&#x27;s speed decreases when traveling through a refractive medium, such as glass or water, as opposed to its velocity in a vacuum.

As light passes the border between media, depending upon the relative refractive indices of the two media, the light will either be refracted to a lesser angle, or a greater one. These angles are measured with respect to the &quot;normal line&quot;, represented perpendicular to the boundary. In the case of light traveling from air into water, light would be refracted towards the normal line, because the light is slowed down in water; light traveling from water to air would refract away from the normal line.

Refraction between two surfaces is also referred to as &quot;reversible&quot; because if all conditions were identical, the angles would be the same for light propagating in the opposite direction.

Snell&#x27;s law is generally true only for isotropic or specular media (such as glass). In anisotropic media such as some crystals, birefringence may split the refracted ray into two rays, the &quot;ordinary&quot; or &quot;o&quot;-ray which follows Snell&#x27;s law, and the other &quot;extraordinary&quot; or &quot;e&quot;-ray which may not be co-planar with the incident ray.

When the light or other wave involved is monochromatic, that is, of a single frequency, Snell&#x27;s law can also be expressed in terms of a ratio of wavelengths in the two media, formula_9 and formula_10:

:formula_11

==Derivations and formula==

Snell&#x27;s law can be derived in various ways.
===Derivation from Fermat&#x27;s principle===
Snell&#x27;s law can be derived from Fermat&#x27;s principle, which states that the light travels the path which takes the least time. By taking the derivative of the optical path length, the stationary point is found giving the path taken by the light. (There are situations of light violating Fermat&#x27;s principle by not taking the least time path, as in reflection in a (spherical) mirror.) In a classic analogy, the area of lower refractive index is replaced by a beach, the area of higher refractive index by the sea, and the fastest way for a rescuer on the beach to get to a drowning person in the sea is to run along a path that follows Snell&#x27;s law.
As shown in the figure to the right, assume the refractive index of medium 1 and medium 2 are formula_7 and formula_8 respectively. Light enters medium 2 from medium 1 via point O.

formula_14 is the angle of incidence, formula_15 is the angle of refraction with respect to the normal.

The phase velocities of light in medium 1 and medium 2 are
:formula_16 and
:formula_17 respectively.

formula_18 is the speed of light in vacuum.

Let T be the time required for the light to travel from point Q through point O to point P. 
:formula_19
where a, b, l and x are as denoted in the right-hand figure, x being the varying parameter.

To minimize it, one can differentiate :

Note that

and formula_22

Therefore,

:formula_24

:formula_25

:formula_26

===Derivation from Huygens&#x27;s principle===

Alternatively, Snell&#x27;s law can be derived using interference of all possible paths of light wave from source to observer—it results in destructive interference.

===Derivation from Maxwell&#x27;s equations===

Another way to derive Snell&#x27;s Law involves an application of the general boundary conditions of Maxwell equations for electromagnetic radiation and induction.

===Derivation from conservation of energy and momentum===
Yet another way to derive Snell&#x27;s law is based on translation symmetry considerations. For example, a homogeneous surface perpendicular to the z direction cannot change the transverse momentum. Since the propagation vector formula_27 is proportional to the photon&#x27;s momentum, the transverse propagation direction formula_28 must remain the same in both regions. Assume without loss of generality a plane of incidence in the formula_29 plane formula_30. Using the well known dependence of the wavenumber on the refractive index of the medium, we derive Snell&#x27;s law immediately.

:formula_31

:formula_32

:formula_33

where formula_34 is the wavenumber in vacuum. Although no surface is truly homogeneous at the atomic scale, full translational symmetry is an excellent approximation whenever the region is homogeneous on the scale of the light wavelength.

===Vector form===
Given a normalized light vector formula_35 (pointing from the light source toward the surface) and a normalized plane normal vector formula_36, one can work out the normalized reflected and refracted rays, via the cosines of the angle of incidence formula_14 and angle of refraction formula_15, without explicitly using the sine values or any trigonometric functions or angles:

:formula_39

Note: formula_40 must be positive, which it will be if formula_36 is the normal vector that points from the surface toward the side where the light is coming from, the region with index formula_7. If formula_40 is negative, then formula_36 points to the side without the light, so start over with formula_36 replaced by its negative.

:formula_46
This reflected direction vector points back toward the side of the surface where the light came from.

Now apply Snell&#x27;s law to the ratio of sines to derive the formula for the refracted ray&#x27;s direction vector:
:formula_47
:formula_48
:formula_49

The formula may appear simpler in terms of renamed simple values formula_50 and formula_51, avoiding any appearance of trig function names or angle names:
:formula_52

Example:
:formula_53
:formula_54
:formula_55

The cosine values may be saved and used in the Fresnel equations for working out the intensity of the resulting rays.

Total internal reflection is indicated by a negative radicand in the equation for formula_56, which can only happen for rays crossing into a less-dense medium (formula_57).

==Total internal reflection and critical angle==
When light travels from a medium with a higher refractive index to one with a lower refractive index, Snell&#x27;s law seems to require in some cases (whenever the angle of incidence is large enough) that the sine of the angle of refraction be greater than one. This of course is impossible, and the light in such cases is completely reflected by the boundary, a phenomenon known as total internal reflection. The largest possible angle of incidence which still results in a refracted ray is called the critical angle; in this case the refracted ray travels along the boundary between the two media.

For example, consider a ray of light moving from water to air with an angle of incidence of 50°. The refractive indices of water and air are approximately 1.333 and 1, respectively, so Snell&#x27;s law gives us the relation

:formula_58

which is impossible to satisfy. The critical angle θcrit is the value of θ1 for which θ2 equals 90°:

:formula_59

==Dispersion==
In many wave-propagation media, wave velocity changes with frequency or wavelength of the waves; this is true of light propagation in most transparent substances other than a vacuum. These media are called dispersive. The result is that the angles determined by Snell&#x27;s law also depend on frequency or wavelength, so that a ray of mixed wavelengths, such as white light, will spread or disperse. Such dispersion of light in glass or water underlies the origin of rainbows and other optical phenomena, in which different wavelengths appear as different colors.

In optical instruments, dispersion leads to chromatic aberration; a color-dependent blurring that sometimes is the resolution-limiting effect. This was especially true in refracting telescopes, before the invention of achromatic objective lenses.

==Lossy, absorbing, or conducting media==

In a conducting medium, permittivity and index of refraction are complex-valued. Consequently, so are the angle of refraction and the wave-vector. This implies that, while the surfaces of constant real phase are planes whose normals make an angle equal to the angle of refraction with the interface normal, the surfaces of constant amplitude, in contrast, are planes parallel to the interface itself. Since these two planes do not in general coincide with each other, the wave is said to be inhomogeneous. The refracted wave is exponentially attenuated, with exponent proportional to the imaginary component of the index of refraction.

<text>() is the Irish language name for &quot;Ireland&quot;. Like its English counterpart, the term &quot;Éire&quot; is used for both the island of Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the sovereign state that governs 85% of the island&#x27;s landmass. The latter is distinct from Northern Ireland (&quot;Tuaisceart Éireann&quot; in the Irish language), which covers the remainder of the northeast of the island. The same name is also sometimes used in English, with or without the &#x27;sineadh fada&#x27; accent, though such use is considered controversial. ( ).

== Etymology ==

The modern Irish &quot;Éire&quot; evolved from the Old Irish word &quot;Ériu&quot;, which was the name of Ireland and of a Gaelic goddess. &quot;Ériu&quot; is generally believed to have been the matron goddess of Ireland, a goddess of sovereignty, or simply a goddess of the land. &quot;Ériu&quot; has been derived from reconstructed Archaic Irish &quot;*Īweriū&quot;, and further from the Proto-Celtic *&quot;Φīwerjon-&quot; (nominative singular &quot;Φīwerjū&quot;). This suggests descent from the Proto-Indo-European *&quot;piHwerjon-&quot; (&quot;fertile land&quot; or &quot;abundant land&quot;), from the adjective &quot;*piHwer-&quot; (&quot;fat&quot;) – cognate with Ancient Greek &quot;píeira&quot; and Sanskrit &quot;pīvarī&quot;, (&quot;fat, full, abounding&quot;). The Archaic Irish form was borrowed from Ancient Greek. During his exploration of northwest Europe (circa 320 BC), Pytheas of Massilia called the island &quot;Ierne&quot; (written ). 
The Pseudo-Aristotelian text &quot;On the Universe&quot; (393b) has:
 Translation: There are two very large islands in it, called the British Isles, Albion and Ierne. (modern Great Britain and Ireland).
In his book &quot;Geographia&quot; (), Claudius Ptolemaeus called the island &quot;Iouernia&quot; (written ; &quot;ou&quot; represented /w/) and named a tribal group called the (, &quot;&quot; or Iverni who lived in the southwest. This was borrowed into Latin as &quot;Hibernia&quot;.

The evolution of the word would follow as such:
*Proto-Celtic *&quot;Φīwerjon-&quot; (nominative singular *&quot;Φīwerjū&quot;)
**Archaic Irish *&quot;Īweriū&quot;
***Old Irish &quot;Ériu&quot;
****Modern Irish &quot;Éire&quot;

An Old Irish by-form of this placename was &quot;íriu&quot;, meaning &quot;land, earth&quot;. In Irish mythology, Íth is the first of the Milesians (Irish) to see Ireland from Iberia. Later, he is the first to step ashore and praises the island&#x27;s abundance, saying to the Tuatha Dé Danann: &quot;You dwell in a good land. Abundant are its mast and honey and wheat and fish&quot;.

A 19th-century proposal, which does not follow modern standards of etymology, derives the name from Scottish Gaelic: &quot;ì&quot; (island) + &quot;thiar&quot; (west) + &quot;fónn&quot; (land), which together give &quot;ì-iar-fhónn&quot;, or &quot;westland isle&quot;. The etymology fails in that &quot;tiar&quot; (the historical form) has no &quot;*téir&quot; forms which would allow the development of the &quot;*é&quot; of &quot;Éire&quot;; moreover, Old Irish &quot;í&quot; (&quot;island&quot;) was a late loanword from Old Norse &quot;ey&quot; (&quot;island&quot;), and so did not exist in prehistoric Ireland.

=== Difference between &quot;Éire&quot; and &quot;Erin&quot; ===
While &quot;Éire&quot; is simply the name for the island of Ireland in the Irish language, and sometimes used in English, &quot;Erin&quot; is a common poetic name for Ireland, as in &quot;Erin go bragh&quot;. The distinction between the two is one of the difference between cases of nouns in Irish. &quot;Éire&quot; is the nominative case, the case that is used for nouns that are the subject of a sentence, i.e., the noun that is &quot;doing&quot; something. &quot;Erin&quot; derives from &quot;Éirinn&quot;, the Irish dative case of &quot;Éire&quot;, which has replaced the nominative case in Déise Irish and some non-standard sub-dialects elsewhere, in Scottish Gaelic (where the usual word for Ireland is ) and Manx (like Irish and Scottish Gaelic, a Goidelic Celtic language), where the word is spelled &quot;Nerin,&quot; with the initial &quot;n-&quot; probably representing a fossilisation of the preposition &quot;in&quot;/&quot;an&quot; &quot;in&quot; (cf. Irish &quot;in Éirinn&quot;, Scottish &quot;an Èirinn&quot;/&quot;ann an Èirinn&quot; &quot;in Ireland&quot;). The genitive case, &quot;Éireann&quot; (e.g. &quot;stair na hÉireann&quot; &quot;the history of Ireland, Ireland&#x27;s history&quot;), is found in the Gaelic forms of the titles of companies and institutions in Ireland e.g. &quot;Iarnród Éireann&quot; (&quot;Irish Rail&quot;), &quot;Dáil Éireann&quot; (&quot;Irish Parliament&quot;), &quot;Poblacht na hÉireann&quot; (&quot;The Republic of Ireland&quot;) or &quot;Tuaisceart Éireann&quot; (&quot;Northern Ireland&quot;).

==As a state name ==
Article 4 of the Irish constitution adopted in 1937 by the government under Éamon de Valera states &quot;&quot;Éire&quot; is the name of the state, or in the English language, &quot;Ireland&quot;&quot;. The Constitution&#x27;s English-language preamble also describes the population as &quot;We, the people of Éire&quot;. Despite the fact that Article 8 designated Irish as the &quot;national&quot; and &quot;first official&quot; language, &quot;Éire&quot; has to some extent passed out of everyday conversation and literature, and the state is referred to as &quot;Ireland&quot; or its equivalent in all other languages.
The name &quot;Éire&quot; has been used on Irish postage stamps since 1922; on all Irish coinage (including Irish euro coins); and together with &quot;Ireland&quot; on passports and other official state documents issued since 1937. &quot;Éire&quot; is used on the seal of the president of Ireland.

Initially, after 1937 the United Kingdom insisted on using only the name &quot;Eire&quot; and refused to accept the name &quot;Ireland&quot;. It adopted the Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938 putting in law that position. At the 1948 Summer Olympics in London the organisers insisted that the Irish team march under the banner &quot;Eire&quot; notwithstanding that every other team was marching according to what their name was in English. The UK Government generally avoided all reference to &quot;Ireland&quot; in connection with the state and used what Senator Thomas O&#x27;Connell described as &quot;sneering titles such as Eirish&quot;. However, the term &quot;Eirish&quot; was also used by some writers in the US, who referred to &quot;the Eirish people&quot;. Using the genitive form &quot;Éireann&quot; as an adjective, the UK media would refer to &quot;Eireann Ministers&quot; and the &quot;Eireann Army&quot;. The Ireland Act 1949 changed this to &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot;. It was not until after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that the UK government accepted the preferred name of simply &quot;Ireland&quot;, at the same time as the Republic of Ireland dropped its territorial claim over Northern Ireland.

Before the 1937 Constitution, &quot;Saorstát Éireann&quot; (the Irish name of the Irish Free State) was generally used.

During the Emergency (as the Second World War was known), Irish ships had &quot;EIRE&quot; (and the Irish tricolour) painted large on their sides and deck, to identify them as neutrals.

In the 1947 Sinn Féin Funds case, a co-defendant was cited as &quot;the Attorney General of Eire&quot; in the High and Supreme Court cases, and there were similar cases where &quot;Eire&quot; was used in the late 1940s as a descriptor of the state in English.
In 1922–1938 the international plate on Irish cars was &quot;SE&quot;. From 1938 to 1962 it was marked &quot;EIR&quot;, short for Éire. Bernard Commons, a Clann na Talmhan TD, suggested to the Dáil in 1950 that the Government examine &quot;the tourist identification plate bearing the letters EIR ... with a view to the adoption of identification letters more readily associated with this country by foreigners&quot;. &quot;EIR&quot; was indicated in the Road Traffic (Third Party Risks) (Visiting Motorists) Regulations 1952 and 1958. The Mechanically Propelled Vehicles (International Circulation) Order 1961 specified EIR but also permitted IRL. and by 1962 &quot;IRL&quot; had been adopted.

Under the 1947 Convention Irish-registered aircraft have carried a registration mark starting &quot;EI&quot; for Éire.

From January 2007, the Irish Government nameplates at meetings of the European Union have borne both &quot;Éire&quot; and &quot;Ireland&quot;, following the adoption of Irish as a working language of the European Union.

==Spelling &quot;Eire&quot; rather than &quot;Éire&quot; ==
In 1938 the British government provided in the Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938 that British legislation would henceforth refer to the Irish Free State as &quot;Eire&quot; (but not as &quot;Ireland&quot;). This was altered by the Ireland Act 1949, where the English-law name of the state was changed to &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot;. The 1938 Act was repealed in 1981, and in 1996 a British journalist described &quot;Eire&quot; as &quot;now an oddity rarely used, an out-of-date reference&quot;.

Within Ireland however, the spelling &quot;Eire&quot; was incorrect. When Irish language texts were printed in Gaelic type, both capital and lower-case letters were printed with diacritics (written accents). From the later 1940s, in conjunction with other reforms, printing switched to the same Latin alphabet used in English. There was some uncertainty about whether the &quot;síneadh fada&quot; (acute accent) should be written on upper-case letters. While it was preserved in all-Irish texts, it was often omitted when short fragments of Irish appeared alone or in English texts. Noel Davern asked in the Dáil in 1974 why Irish stamps had &quot;EIRE&quot; rather than &quot;ÉIRE&quot;. The reply from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was:

Davern considered &quot;EIRE&quot; to be worse than a misspelling, because &quot;eire&quot; is a word in its own right, meaning &quot;a burden, load or encumbrance&quot;. The minister stated, &quot;The word on the stamp ... does not mean &#x27;eire&#x27; and it is not understood to mean &#x27;eire&#x27; by anybody except Davern.&quot; Stamps later used a Gaelic type with the accent preserved.

English rarely uses diacritics for English words, and often omits them from written loanwords from any source language; the acute accent is often omitted when &quot;ÉIRE&quot; is written in English—in that context, the omission or expression is regarded by English speakers who do not speak Irish as a negligible variation, reflecting two accepted spellings without further implication, in the same way as Mexico and México are seen as being the same. But for an Irish-speaker the diacritic changes the pronunciation.

== Other uses ==
&quot;Éire&quot; has been incorporated into the names of Irish commercial and social entities, such as Eir (formerly Eircom and Telecom Éireann) and its former mobile phone network, Eircell. Ireland&#x27;s postal code system is known as Eircode. In 2006 the Irish electricity network was devolved to EirGrid. The company &quot;BetEire Flow&quot; (eFlow), named as a pun on &quot;better&quot;, is a French consortium running the electronic tolling system at the West-Link bridge west of Dublin. According to the Dublin Companies Registration Office in 2008, over 500 company names incorporate the word Éire in some form.

<text>The Montreal Canadiens (), officially ( Canadian Hockey Club) and colloquially known as the Habs, are a professional ice hockey team based in Montreal. The Canadiens compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference. Since 1996, the team has played its home games at Bell Centre, originally known as Molson Centre. The Canadiens previously played at the Montreal Forum, which housed the team for seven decades and all but their first two Stanley Cup championships.

Founded in 1909, the Canadiens are the oldest continuously operating professional ice hockey team worldwide, and the only existing NHL club to predate the founding of the league. One of the earliest North American professional sports franchises, the Canadiens&#x27; history predates that of every other Canadian franchise outside the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Toronto Argonauts, as well as every American franchise outside baseball and the National Football League&#x27;s Arizona Cardinals. The franchise is one of the &quot;Original Six&quot;, the teams that made up the NHL from 1942 until the 1967 expansion. The team&#x27;s championship season in 1992–93 marked the last time a Canadian team won the Stanley Cup.

The Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup more times than any other franchise, having earned 24 championships, with 23 victories since the founding of the NHL, and 22 since 1927, when NHL teams became the only ones to compete for the Stanley Cup. The Canadiens also had the most championships by a team of any of the major North American sports leagues until the New York Yankees won their 25th World Series title in 1999.

==History==

The Canadiens were founded by J. Ambrose O&#x27;Brien on December 4, 1909, as a charter member of the National Hockey Association (NHA), the forerunner to the National Hockey League. It was to be the team of the francophone community in Montreal, composed of francophone players, and under francophone ownership as soon as possible. The founders named the team &quot;Les Canadiens,&quot; a term identified at the time with French speakers. The team&#x27;s first season was not a success, as they placed last in the league. After the first year, ownership was transferred to George Kennedy of Montreal and the team&#x27;s record improved over the next seasons. The team won its first Stanley Cup championship in the 1915–16 season. In 1917, with four other NHA teams, the Canadiens formed the NHL, and they won their first NHL Stanley Cup during the 1923–24 season, led by Howie Morenz. The team moved from the Mount Royal Arena to the Montreal Forum for the 1926–27 season.

The club began the 1930s decade successfully, with back-to-back Stanley Cup wins in 1930 and 1931. However, the Canadiens, along with cross-town rivals the Montreal Maroons, declined both on the ice and economically during the Great Depression era. Losses grew to the point where team owners considered selling interest to Cleveland, Ohio, though local investors were ultimately found to finance the Canadiens. After the Maroons suspended operations following the 1937–38 season, several of their players joined the Canadiens.

Led by the &quot;Punch Line&quot; of Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard, Toe Blake and Elmer Lach in the 1940s, the Canadiens enjoyed success again atop the NHL. From 1953 to 1960, the franchise won six Stanley Cups, including a record five straight from 1956 to 1960, with a new set of stars coming to prominence: Jean Beliveau, Dickie Moore, Doug Harvey, Bernie &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Geoffrion, Jacques Plante and Richard&#x27;s younger brother, Henri.
The Canadiens added ten more championships in 15 seasons from 1965 to 1979, with another dynastic run of four-straight Cups from 1976 to 1979. In the 1976–77 season, the Canadiens set three still-standing team records – fewest losses (8) in an 80-game season, the longest home unbeaten streak (34), and best goal differential (+216) – and one record that lasted until the 2022–23 Boston Bruins beat it, for the most points (132) in an 80-game season. The next season, 1977–78, the team had a 28-game unbeaten streak, the second-longest in NHL history. The next generation of stars included Guy Lafleur, Yvan Cournoyer, Ken Dryden, Pete Mahovlich, Jacques Lemaire, Pierre Larouche, Steve Shutt, Bob Gainey, Serge Savard, Guy Lapointe and Larry Robinson. Scotty Bowman, who would later set a record for most NHL victories by a coach, was the team&#x27;s head coach for its last five Stanley Cup victories in the 1970s.

The Canadiens won Stanley Cups in 1986, led by rookie star goaltender Patrick Roy, and in 1993, continuing their streak of winning at least one championship in every decade from the 1910s to the 1990s (this streak came to an end in the 2000s). In 1996, the Habs moved from the Montreal Forum, their home during 70 seasons and 22 Stanley Cups, to Molson Centre (now called Bell Centre).

Following Roy&#x27;s departure in 1995, the Canadiens fell into an extended stretch of mediocrity, missing the playoffs in four of their next ten seasons and failing to advance past the second round of the playoffs until 2010. By the late 1990s, with both an ailing team and monetary losses exacerbated by a record-low value of the Canadian dollar, Montreal fans feared their team would end up relocated to the United States. Team owner Molson Brewery sold control of the franchise and the Molson Centre to American businessman George N. Gillett Jr. in 2001, with the right of first refusal for any future sale by Gillett and a condition that the NHL Board of Governors must unanimously approve any attempt to move to a new city. Led by club president Pierre Boivin, the Canadiens returned to being a lucrative enterprise, earning additional revenues from broadcasting and arena events. In 2009, Gillett sold the franchise to a consortium led by the Molson family which included The Woodbridge Company, BCE/Bell, the Fonds de solidarité FTQ, Michael Andlauer, Luc Bertrand and the National Bank Financial Group for $575 million, more than double the $275 million he spent on the purchase eight years prior.

During the 2008–09 season, the Canadiens celebrated their 100th anniversary with various events,
including hosting both the 2009 NHL All-Star Game, and the 2009 NHL entry draft.

The Canadiens became the first team in NHL history to reach 3,000 victories with their 5–2 victory over the Florida Panthers on December 29, 2008.
For the 2020–21 season, the league moved the Canadiens along with the other six teams from Canada to the North Division. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Canadiens only played against teams in the division in the regular season to avoid travel restrictions between the United States and Canada. All teams in the division played without fans to begin the season. The Canadiens advanced through the 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs, beating the Toronto Maple Leafs in the first round of the playoffs 4–3, overcoming a 3–1 Maple Leafs lead in the series. The Canadiens then swept the Winnipeg Jets in the second round, advancing to the Stanley Cup semifinals. After defeating the Vegas Golden Knights in the penultimate round, clinching an overtime victory in game 6 of the series, they reached their first Stanley Cup Finals in 28 years, whilst also being the first Canadian team to do so since the Vancouver Canucks in 2011. Montreal eventually lost the Finals to the Tampa Bay Lightning, 4–1.

In 2021–22, the Canadiens were unable to replicate their success from the prior season, ultimately finishing last in the league for the first time since the 1939–40 season and the first time in the NHL&#x27;s expansion era, in what was one of the worst seasons in the team&#x27;s history. In the process, they set team records for most regulation losses (49), most goals against (319), fewest wins (22), and fewest points (55), while their .335 point percentage was the team&#x27;s third-worst ever, after only the 1925–26 (.319) and 1939–40 (.260) campaigns. As a result, team owner Geoff Molson authorized a &quot;rebuild&quot; of the roster over an extended period, a first in the modern history of the franchise. The Canadiens finished fifth-last in the subsequent 2022–23 and 2023–24 seasons.

==Team identity==

The Canadiens organization operates in both English and French. For many years, public address announcements and press releases have been given in both languages, and the team website and social media outlets are in both languages as well. At home games, the first stanza of O Canada is sung in French, and the chorus is sung in English.

===Crest and sweater design===

One of sport&#x27;s oldest and most recognizable logos, the classic &#x27;C&#x27; and &#x27;H&#x27; of the Montreal Canadiens was first used together in the 1917–18 season, when the club changed its name to &quot;Club de hockey Canadien&quot; from &quot;Club athlétique Canadien&quot;, before evolving to its current form in 1952–53. The &quot;H&quot; stands for &quot;hockey&quot;, not &quot;Habitants,&quot; a popular misconception. According to About.com, the first man to refer to the team as &quot;the Habs&quot; was American Tex Rickard, owner of the Madison Square Garden, in 1924. Rickard apparently told a reporter that the &quot;H&quot; on the Canadiens&#x27; sweaters was for &quot;Habitants&quot;. In French, the &quot;Habitants&quot; nickname dates back to at least 1914, when it was printed in &quot;Le Devoir&quot; to report a 9–3 win over Toronto on the ninth of February.

Since 1911, the team&#x27;s primary colours are blue, white and red. The home sweater is predominantly red in colour and features four blue and white stripes: one across each arm, one across the chest and the other across the waistline. The main road sweater is white with a red and blue stripe across the waist, red at the end of both arm sleeves, and red shoulder yokes. The basic design has been in use since 1914 and took its current form in 1925, generally evolving as materials changed. Because of the team&#x27;s lengthy history and significance in Quebec, the sweater has been referred to as (the holy flannel sweater).

As of 2015, the Canadiens&#x27; home red sweater is the only uniform in the league to feature the French language version of the NHL shield logo (LNH) on the neck collar, in acknowledgment of Montreal&#x27;s French Canadian heritage. The road white sweater retains the English NHL shield logo.

The Canadiens used multiple designs prior to adopting the aforementioned design in 1914. The original shirt of the 1909–10 season was blue with a white C. The second season had a red shirt featuring a green maple leaf with the C logo, and green pants. Lastly, the season before adopting the current look the Canadiens wore a &quot;barber pole&quot; design jersey with red, white and blue stripes, and the logo being a white maple leaf reading &quot;CAC&quot;, &quot;Club athlétique Canadien&quot;. All three designs were worn during the 2009–10 season as part of the Canadiens&#x27; centenary.

In the 2020–21 season, the Canadiens unveiled a &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; alternate uniform in collaboration with Adidas. The uniform was essentially the same as their regular red uniform, but with blue as the primary colour and red as the stripe colour. A second iteration was released in the 2022–23 season, again using the same template but with red relegated to the logo only and featuring a light blue base with white/dark blue/white stripes. 

This period also saw the introduction of corporate sponsor advertising across NHL-sanctioned equipment, starting with helmet ads and followed by front jersey patches on gameday uniforms. Contextually, the Canadiens&#x27; away jerseys feature the Air Canada logo in the upper right chest area whereas the name and shield for the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) is stitched onto its home counterpart.

The Canadiens&#x27; colours are a readily identifiable aspect of French Canadian culture. In the short story &quot;The Hockey Sweater&quot;, Roch Carrier described the influence of the Canadiens and their jersey within rural Quebec communities during the 1940s. The story was later made into an animated short, &quot;The Sweater&quot;, narrated by Carrier. A passage from the short story appears on the 2002 issuance of the Canadian five-dollar bill.

===Motto===

To you from failing hands we throw the torch. Be yours to hold it high.
The motto is from the poem &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; by John McCrae, which was written in 1915, the year before the Canadiens won their first Stanley Cup championship. The motto appears on the wall of the Canadiens&#x27; dressing room as well as on the inside collar of the new Adidas Adizero jerseys introduced in 2017.

===Mascot===

Beginning in the 2004–05 season, the Canadiens adopted Youppi! as their official mascot, the first costumed mascot in their long history. The foregoing was the longtime mascot for Major League Baseball (MLB)&#x27;s Montreal Expos but was dropped from the franchise when they moved to Washington, D.C. prior to the 2005 MLB season and became the Washington Nationals. With the changeover, Youppi! became the first mascot in professional sports to switch leagues. He is also the first mascot in professional sports to get ejected from a game dating back to his time with the Expos. In June 2020, Youppi! became the first mascot from a Canadian-based club to be inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame.

In November 2022, the Canadiens introduced METAL!, an &quot;unofficial official mascot&quot;, for the team&#x27;s Reverse Retro series of games that season. METAL! was retired ahead of the 2024–25 season.

===Rivalries===

====Toronto Maple Leafs====

The Canadiens have developed strong rivalries with two fellow Original Six franchises, with whom they frequently shared divisions and competed in postseason play. The oldest is with the Toronto Maple Leafs, who first faced the Canadiens as the Toronto Arenas in 1917. The teams met 16 times in the playoffs, including five Stanley Cup Finals. Featuring the two largest cities in Canada and two of the largest fanbases in the league, the rivalry is sometimes dramatized as being emblematic of Canada&#x27;s English and French linguistic divide. From 1938 to 1970, they were the only two Canadian teams in the league.

====Boston Bruins====

The team&#x27;s other Original Six rivals are the Boston Bruins, who, since their NHL debut in 1924 have played the Canadiens more than any other team in both regular season play and the playoffs combined. The teams have played 34 playoff series, seven of which were in the finals.

====Quebec Nordiques (1979–1995)====

The Canadiens also had an intraprovincial rivalry with the Quebec Nordiques during their existence from 1979 to 1995, nicknamed the &quot;Battle of Quebec&quot;.

==Broadcasting==

Montreal Canadiens games are broadcast locally in both the French and English languages. CHMP 98.5 is the Canadiens&#x27; French-language radio flagship. As of the 2017–18 season, the team&#x27;s regional television in both languages, and its English-language radio rights, are held by Bell Media. CKGM, &quot;TSN Radio 690&quot;, is the English-language radio flagship; it acquired the rights under a seven-year deal which began in the 2011–12 season. In June 2017, Bell Media reached a five-year extension.

Regional television rights in French are held by Réseau des sports (RDS) under a 12-year deal that began in the 2014–15 season. A sister to the English-language network TSN, RDS was the only French-language sports channel in Canada until the 2011 launch of TVA Sports, and was also the previous national French rightsholder of the NHL; as a result, the Canadiens forwent a separate regional contract, and allowed all of its games to be televised nationally in French as part of RDS&#x27;s overall NHL rights.

With TVA Sports becoming the national French rightsholder in the 2014–15 season through a sub-licensing agreement with Sportsnet, RDS subsequently announced a 12-year deal to maintain regional rights to Canadiens games not shown on TVA Sports. As a result, games on RDS are blacked out outside the Canadiens&#x27; home market of Quebec, Atlantic Canada and parts of Eastern Ontario shared with the Ottawa Senators. At least 22 Canadiens games per season (primarily through its Saturday night &quot;La super soirée LNH&quot;), including all playoff games, are televised nationally by TVA Sports.

TSN2 assumed the English-language regional television rights in the 2017–18 season, with John Bartlett on play-by-play, and Dave Poulin, Mike Johnson and Craig Button on colour commentary. All other games, including all playoff games, are televised nationally by Sportsnet or CBC. Bartlett returned to Sportsnet over the 2018 off-season, and was succeeded by Bryan Mudryk.

English-language regional rights were previously held by Sportsnet East (with CJNT &quot;City Montreal&quot; as an overflow channel), under a three-year deal that expired following the 2016–17 season; the games were called by Bartlett and Jason York. Prior to this deal, TSN held the rights from 2010 through 2014; the games were broadcast on a part-time channel with Dave Randorf on play-by-play.

==Players and personnel==

===Current roster===
===Honoured members===
====Retired numbers====

Collectively, the Canadiens have retired 15 numbers in honour of 18 players, the most of any team in the NHL. All honourees were born in Canada and were members of at least two Stanley Cup winning Canadiens teams. Howie Morenz was the first honouree, on November 2, 1937. The NHL retired Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s No. 99 for all its member teams at the 2000 NHL All-Star Game.

====Hall of Fame====
The Montreal Canadiens have an affiliation with a number of inductees to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Thirty-seven of these players are from three separate notable dynasties: 12 from 1955 to 1960, 11 from 1964 to 1969, and 13 from 1975 to 1979. Howie Morenz and Georges Vezina were the first Canadiens given the honour in 1945, while Shea Weber was the most recently inducted, in 2024. Along with players, a number of inductees from the builders category are affiliated with the club. The first inductee was vice president William Northey in 1945. The most recent inductee was Pat Burns in 2014.

In addition to players and builders, seven broadcasters for the Montreal Canadiens have been awarded the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame. The first two recipients of the award were Danny Gallivan and Rene Lecavalier in 1984. The other five award recipients are Doug Smith (1985), Dick Irvin Jr. (1988), Richard Garneau (1999), Gilles Tremblay (2002), and Pierre Houde (2024).

<text>Ornithology is a branch of zoology that concerns the study of birds. Several aspects of ornithology differ from related disciplines, due partly to the high visibility and the aesthetic appeal of birds. It has also been an area with a large contribution made by amateurs in terms of time, resources, and financial support. Studies on birds have helped develop key concepts in biology including evolution, behaviour and ecology such as the definition of species, the process of speciation, instinct, learning, ecological niches, guilds, insular biogeography, phylogeography, and conservation.

While early ornithology was principally concerned with descriptions and distributions of species, ornithologists today seek answers to very specific questions, often using birds as models to test hypotheses or predictions based on theories. Most modern biological theories apply across life forms, and the number of scientists who identify themselves as &quot;ornithologists&quot; has therefore declined. A wide range of tools and techniques are used in ornithology, both inside the laboratory and out in the field, and innovations are constantly made. Most biologists who recognise themselves as &quot;ornithologists&quot; study specific biology research areas, such as anatomy, physiology, taxonomy (phylogenetics), ecology, or behaviour.

The word &quot;ornithology&quot; comes from the late 16th-century Latin &quot;ornithologia&quot; meaning &quot;bird science&quot; from the Greek ὄρνις &quot;ornis&quot; (&quot;bird&quot;) and λόγος &quot;logos&quot; (&quot;theory, science, thought&quot;).

==History==

The history of ornithology largely reflects the trends in the history of biology, as well as many other scientific disciplines, including ecology, anatomy, physiology, paleontology, and more recently, molecular biology. Trends include the move from mere descriptions to the identification of patterns, thus towards elucidating the processes that produce these patterns.

===Early knowledge and study===
Humans have had an observational relationship with birds since prehistory, with some stone-age drawings being amongst the oldest indications of an interest in birds. Birds were perhaps important as food sources, and bones of as many as 80 species have been found in excavations of early Stone Age settlements. Water bird and seabird remains have also been found in shell mounds on the island of Oronsay off the coast of Scotland.

Cultures around the world have rich vocabularies related to birds. Traditional bird names are often based on detailed knowledge of the behaviour, with many names being onomatopoeic, and still in use. Traditional knowledge may also involve the use of birds in folk medicine and knowledge of these practices are passed on through oral traditions (see ethnoornithology). Hunting of wild birds as well as their domestication would have required considerable knowledge of their habits. Poultry farming and falconry were practised from early times in many parts of the world. Artificial incubation of poultry was practised in China around 246 BC and around at least 400 BC in Egypt. The Egyptians also made use of birds in their hieroglyphic scripts, many of which, though stylized, are still identifiable to species. Early written records provide valuable information on the past distributions of species. For instance, Xenophon records the abundance of the ostrich in Assyria (Anabasis, i. 5); this subspecies from Asia Minor is extinct and all extant ostrich races are today restricted to Africa. Other old writings such as the Vedas (1500–800 BC) demonstrate the careful observation of avian life histories and include the earliest reference to the habit of brood parasitism by the Asian koel (&quot;Eudynamys scolopaceus&quot;). Like writing, the early art of China, Japan, Persia, and India also demonstrate knowledge, with examples of scientifically accurate bird illustrations.

Aristotle in 350 BC in his &quot;History of animals&quot; noted the habit of bird migration, moulting, egg laying, and lifespans, as well as compiling a list of 170 different bird species. However, he also introduced and propagated several myths, such as the idea that swallows hibernated in winter, although he noted that cranes migrated from the steppes of Scythia to the marshes at the headwaters of the Nile. The idea of swallow hibernation became so well established that even as late as in 1878, Elliott Coues could list as many as 182 contemporary publications dealing with the hibernation of swallows and little published evidence to contradict the theory. Similar misconceptions existed regarding the breeding of barnacle geese. Their nests had not been seen, and they were believed to grow by transformations of goose barnacles, an idea that became prevalent from around the 11th century and noted by Bishop Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales) in &quot;Topographia Hiberniae&quot; (1187). Around 77 AD, Pliny the Elder described birds, among other creatures, in his &quot;Historia Naturalis&quot;.

The earliest record of falconry comes from the reign of Sargon II (722–705 BC) in Assyria. Falconry is thought to have made its entry to Europe only after AD 400, brought in from the east after invasions by the Huns and Alans. Starting from the eighth century, numerous Arabic works on the subject and general ornithology were written, as well as translations of the works of ancient writers from Greek and Syriac. In the 12th and 13th centuries, crusades and conquest had subjugated Islamic territories in southern Italy, central Spain, and the Levant under European rule, and for the first time translations into Latin of the great works of Arabic and Greek scholars were made with the help of Jewish and Muslim scholars, especially in Toledo, which had fallen into Christian hands in 1085 and whose libraries had escaped destruction. Michael Scotus from Scotland made a Latin translation of Aristotle&#x27;s work on animals from Arabic here around 1215, which was disseminated widely and was the first time in a millennium that this foundational text on zoology became available to Europeans. Falconry was popular in the Norman court in Sicily, and a number of works on the subject were written in Palermo. Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (1194–1250) learned about an falconry during his youth in Sicily and later built up a menagerie and sponsored translations of Arabic texts, among which the popular Arabic work known as the &quot;Liber Moaminus&quot; by an unknown author which was translated into Latin by Theodore of Antioch from Syria in 1240–1241 as the &quot;De Scientia Venandi per Aves&quot;, and also Michael Scotus (who had removed to Palermo) translated Ibn Sīnā&#x27;s &quot;Kitāb al-Ḥayawān&quot; of 1027 for the Emperor, a commentary and scientific update of Aristotle&#x27;s work which was part of Ibn Sīnā&#x27;s massive &quot;Kitāb al-Šifāʾ&quot;. Frederick II eventually wrote his own treatise on falconry, the &quot;De arte venandi cum avibus&quot;, in which he related his ornithological observations and the results of the hunts and experiments his court enjoyed performing.

Several early German and French scholars compiled old works and conducted new research on birds. These included Guillaume Rondelet, who described his observations in the Mediterranean, and Pierre Belon, who described the fish and birds that he had seen in France and the Levant. Belon&#x27;s &quot;Book of Birds&quot; (1555) is a folio volume with descriptions of some 200 species. His comparison of the skeleton of humans and birds is considered as a landmark in comparative anatomy. Volcher Coiter (1534–1576), a Dutch anatomist, made detailed studies of the internal structures of birds and produced a classification of birds, &quot;De Differentiis Avium&quot; (around 1572), that was based on structure and habits. Konrad Gesner wrote the &quot;Vogelbuch&quot; and &quot;Icones avium omnium&quot; around 1557. Like Gesner, Ulisse Aldrovandi, an encyclopedic naturalist, began a 14-volume natural history with three volumes on birds, entitled &quot;ornithologiae hoc est de avibus historiae libri XII&quot;, which was published from 1599 to 1603. Aldrovandi showed great interest in plants and animals, and his work included 3000 drawings of fruits, flowers, plants, and animals, published in 363 volumes. His &quot;Ornithology&quot; alone covers 2000 pages and included such aspects as the chicken and poultry techniques. He used a number of traits including behaviour, particularly bathing and dusting, to classify bird groups.


William Turner&#x27;s &quot;Historia Avium&quot; (&quot;History of Birds&quot;), published at Cologne in 1544, was an early ornithological work from England. He noted the commonness of kites in English cities where they snatched food out of the hands of children. He included folk beliefs such as those of anglers. Anglers believed that the osprey emptied their fishponds and would kill them, mixing the flesh of the osprey into their fish bait. Turner&#x27;s work reflected the violent times in which he lived, and stands in contrast to later works such as Gilbert White&#x27;s 1789 &quot;The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne&quot; that were written in a tranquil era.

In the 17th century, Francis Willughby (1635–1672) and John Ray (1627–1705) created the first major system of bird classification that was based on function and morphology rather than on form or behaviour. Willughby&#x27;s &quot;Ornithologiae libri tres&quot; (1676) completed by John Ray is sometimes considered to mark the beginning of scientific ornithology. Ray also worked on &quot;Ornithologia&quot;, which was published posthumously in 1713 as &quot;Synopsis methodica avium et piscium&quot;. The earliest list of British birds, &quot;Pinax Rerum Naturalium Britannicarum&quot;, was written by Christopher Merrett in 1667, but authors such as John Ray considered it of little value. Ray did, however, value the expertise of the naturalist Sir Thomas Browne (1605–82), who not only answered his queries on ornithological identification and nomenclature, but also those of Willoughby and Merrett in letter correspondence. Browne himself in his lifetime kept an eagle, owl, cormorant, bittern, and ostrich, penned a tract on falconry, and introduced the words &quot;incubation&quot; and &quot;oviparous&quot; into the English language. 

Towards the late 18th century, Mathurin Jacques Brisson (1723–1806) and Comte de Buffon (1707–1788) began new works on birds. Brisson produced a six-volume work &quot;Ornithologie&quot; in 1760 and Buffon&#x27;s included nine volumes (volumes 16–24) on birds &quot;Histoire naturelle des oiseaux&quot; (1770–1785) in his work on science &quot; Histoire naturelle générale et particulière&quot; (1749–1804). Jacob Temminck sponsored François Le Vaillant [1753–1824] to collect bird specimens in Southern Africa and Le Vaillant&#x27;s six-volume &quot;Histoire naturelle des oiseaux d&#x27;Afrique&quot; (1796–1808) included many non-African birds. His other bird books produced in collaboration with the artist Barraband are considered among the most valuable illustrated guides ever produced. Louis Pierre Vieillot (1748–1831) spent 10 years studying North American birds and wrote the &quot;Histoire naturelle des oiseaux de l&#x27;Amerique septentrionale&quot; (1807–1808?). Vieillot pioneered in the use of life histories and habits in classification. Alexander Wilson composed a nine-volume work, &quot;American Ornithology&quot;, published 1808–1814, which is the first such record of North American birds, significantly antedating Audubon. In the early 19th century, Lewis and Clark studied and identified many birds in the western United States. John James Audubon, born in 1785, observed and painted birds in France and later in the Ohio and Mississippi valleys. From 1827 to 1838, Audubon published &quot;The Birds of America&quot;, which was engraved by Robert Havell Sr. and his son Robert Havell Jr. Containing 435 engravings, it is often regarded as the greatest ornithological work in history.

===Scientific studies===

The emergence of ornithology as a scientific discipline began in the 18th century, when Mark Catesby published his two-volume &quot;Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands&quot;, a landmark work which included 220 hand-painted engravings and was the basis for many of the species Carl Linnaeus described in the 1758 &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Linnaeus&#x27; work revolutionised bird taxonomy by assigning every species a binomial name, categorising them into different genera. However, ornithology did not emerge as a specialised science until the Victorian era—with the popularization of natural history, and the collection of natural objects such as bird eggs and skins. This specialization led to the formation in Britain of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union in 1858. In 1859, the members founded its journal &quot;The Ibis&quot;. The sudden spurt in ornithology was also due in part to colonialism. At 100 years later, in 1959, R. E. Moreau noted that ornithology in this period was preoccupied with the geographical distributions of various species of birds.
The bird collectors of the Victorian era observed the variations in bird forms and habits across geographic regions, noting local specialization and variation in widespread species. The collections of museums and private collectors grew with contributions from various parts of the world. The naming of species with binomials and the organization of birds into groups based on their similarities became the main work of museum specialists. The variations in widespread birds across geographical regions caused the introduction of trinomial names.

The search for patterns in the variations of birds was attempted by many. Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775–1854), his student Johann Baptist von Spix (1781–1826), and several others believed that a hidden and innate mathematical order existed in the forms of birds. They believed that a &quot;natural&quot; classification was available and superior to &quot;artificial&quot; ones. A particularly popular idea was the Quinarian system popularised by Nicholas Aylward Vigors (1785–1840), William Sharp Macleay (1792–1865), William Swainson, and others. The idea was that nature followed a &quot;rule of five&quot; with five groups nested hierarchically. Some had attempted a rule of four, but Johann Jakob Kaup (1803–1873) insisted that the number five was special, noting that other natural entities such as the senses also came in fives. He followed this idea and demonstrated his view of the order within the crow family. Where he failed to find five genera, he left a blank insisting that a new genus would be found to fill these gaps. These ideas were replaced by more complex &quot;maps&quot; of affinities in works by Hugh Edwin Strickland and Alfred Russel Wallace. A major advance was made by Max Fürbringer in 1888, who established a comprehensive phylogeny of birds based on anatomy, morphology, distribution, and biology. This was developed further by Hans Gadow and others.

The Galapagos finches were especially influential in the development of Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution. His contemporary Alfred Russel Wallace also noted these variations and the geographical separations between different forms leading to the study of biogeography. Wallace was influenced by the work of Philip Lutley Sclater on the distribution patterns of birds.

For Darwin, the problem was how species arose from a common ancestor, but he did not attempt to find rules for delineation of species. The species problem was tackled by the ornithologist Ernst Mayr, who was able to demonstrate that geographical isolation and the accumulation of genetic differences led to the splitting of species.

Early ornithologists were preoccupied with matters of species identification. Only systematics counted as true science and field studies were considered inferior through much of the 19th century. In 1901, Robert Ridgway wrote in the introduction to &quot;The Birds of North and Middle America&quot; that:

This early idea that the study of living birds was merely recreation held sway until ecological theories became the predominant focus of ornithological studies. The study of birds in their habitats was particularly advanced in Germany with bird ringing stations established as early as 1903. By the 1920s, the &quot;Journal für Ornithologie&quot; included many papers on the behaviour, ecology, anatomy, and physiology, many written by Erwin Stresemann. Stresemann changed the editorial policy of the journal, leading both to a unification of field and laboratory studies and a shift of research from museums to universities. Ornithology in the United States continued to be dominated by museum studies of morphological variations, species identities, and geographic distributions, until it was influenced by Stresemann&#x27;s student Ernst Mayr. In Britain, some of the earliest ornithological works that used the word ecology appeared in 1915. &quot;The Ibis&quot;, however, resisted the introduction of these new methods of study, and no paper on ecology appeared until 1943. The work of David Lack on population ecology was pioneering. Newer quantitative approaches were introduced for the study of ecology and behaviour, and this was not readily accepted. For instance, Claud Ticehurst wrote:

David Lack&#x27;s studies on population ecology sought to find the processes involved in the regulation of population based on the evolution of optimal clutch sizes. He concluded that population was regulated primarily by density-dependent controls, and also suggested that natural selection produces life-history traits that maximize the fitness of individuals. Others, such as Wynne-Edwards, interpreted population regulation as a mechanism that aided the &quot;species&quot; rather than individuals. This led to widespread and sometimes bitter debate on what constituted the &quot;unit of selection&quot;. Lack also pioneered the use of many new tools for ornithological research, including the idea of using radar to study bird migration.

Birds were also widely used in studies of the niche hypothesis and Georgii Gause&#x27;s competitive exclusion principle. Work on resource partitioning and the structuring of bird communities through competition were made by Robert MacArthur. Patterns of biodiversity also became a topic of interest. Work on the relationship of the number of species to area and its application in the study of island biogeography was pioneered by E. O. Wilson and Robert MacArthur. These studies led to the development of the discipline of landscape ecology.

John Hurrell Crook studied the behaviour of weaverbirds and demonstrated the links between ecological conditions, behaviour, and social systems. Principles from economics were introduced to the study of biology by Jerram L. Brown in his work on explaining territorial behaviour. This led to more studies of behaviour that made use of cost-benefit analyses. The rising interest in sociobiology also led to a spurt of bird studies in this area.

The study of imprinting behaviour in ducks and geese by Konrad Lorenz and the studies of instinct in herring gulls by Nicolaas Tinbergen led to the establishment of the field of ethology. The study of learning became an area of interest and the study of bird songs has been a model for studies in neuroethology. The study of hormones and physiology in the control of behaviour has also been aided by bird models. These have helped in finding the proximate causes of circadian and seasonal cycles. Studies on migration have attempted to answer questions on the evolution of migration, orientation, and navigation.

The growth of genetics and the rise of molecular biology led to the application of the gene-centered view of evolution to explain avian phenomena. Studies on kinship and altruism, such as helpers, became of particular interest. The idea of inclusive fitness was used to interpret observations on behaviour and life history, and birds were widely used models for testing hypotheses based on theories postulated by W. D. Hamilton and others.

The new tools of molecular biology changed the study of bird systematics, which changed from being based on phenotype to the underlying genotype. The use of techniques such as DNA–DNA hybridization to study evolutionary relationships was pioneered by Charles Sibley and Jon Edward Ahlquist, resulting in what is called the Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy. These early techniques have been replaced by newer ones based on mitochondrial DNA sequences and molecular phylogenetics approaches that make use of computational procedures for sequence alignment, construction of phylogenetic trees, and calibration of molecular clocks to infer evolutionary relationships. Molecular techniques are also widely used in studies of avian population biology and ecology.

===Rise to popularity===
The use of field glasses or telescopes for bird observation began in the 1820s and 1830s, with pioneers such as J. Dovaston (who also pioneered in the use of bird feeders), but instruction manuals did not begin to insist on the use of optical aids such as &quot;a first-class telescope&quot; or &quot;field glass&quot; until the 1880s.
The rise of field guides for the identification of birds was another major innovation. The early guides such as Thomas Bewick&#x27;s two-volume guide and William Yarrell&#x27;s three-volume guide were cumbersome, and mainly focused on identifying specimens in the hand. The earliest of the new generation of field guides was prepared by Florence Merriam, sister of Clinton Hart Merriam, the mammalogist. This was published in 1887 in a series &quot;Hints to Audubon Workers: Fifty Birds and How to Know Them&quot; in Grinnell&#x27;s &quot;Audubon Magazine&quot;. These were followed by new field guides, 
from the pioneering illustrated handbooks of Frank Chapman to the classic &quot;Field Guide to the Birds&quot; by Roger Tory Peterson in 1934, to &quot;Birds of the West Indies&quot; published in 1936 by Dr. James Bond - the same who inspired the amateur ornithologist Ian Fleming in naming his famous literary spy.

The interest in birdwatching grew in popularity in many parts of the world, and the possibility for amateurs to contribute to biological studies was soon realized. As early as 1916, Julian Huxley wrote a two-part article in &quot;The Auk&quot;, noting the tensions between amateurs and professionals, and suggested the possibility that the &quot;vast army of bird lovers and bird watchers could begin providing the data scientists needed to address the fundamental problems of biology.&quot; The amateur ornithologist Harold F. Mayfield noted that the field was also funded by non-professionals. He noted that in 1975, 12% of the papers in American ornithology journals were written by persons who were not employed in biology related work.

Organizations were started in many countries, and these grew rapidly in membership, most notable among them being the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) in Britain and the Audubon Society in the US, which started in 1885. Both these organizations were started with the primary objective of conservation. The RSPB, born in 1889, grew from a small Croydon-based group of women, including Eliza Phillips, Etta Lemon, Catherine Hall and Hannah Poland. Calling themselves the &quot;Fur, Fin, and Feather Folk&quot;, the group met regularly and took a pledge &quot;to refrain from wearing the feathers of any birds not killed for the purpose of food, the ostrich only exempted.&quot; The organization did not allow men as members initially, avenging a policy of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union to keep out women. Unlike the RSPB, which was primarily conservation oriented, the British Trust for Ornithology was started in 1933 with the aim of advancing ornithological research. Members were often involved in collaborative ornithological projects. These projects have resulted in atlases which detail the distribution of bird species across Britain. In Canada, citizen scientist Elsie Cassels studied migratory birds and was involved in establishing Gaetz Lakes bird sanctuary. In the United States, the Breeding Bird Surveys, conducted by the United States Geological Survey, have also produced atlases with information on breeding densities and changes in the density and distribution over time. Other volunteer collaborative ornithology projects were subsequently established in other parts of the world.

==Techniques==
The tools and techniques of ornithology are varied, and new inventions and approaches are quickly incorporated. The techniques may be broadly dealt under the categories of those that are applicable to specimens and those that are used in the field, but the classification is rough and many analysis techniques are usable both in the laboratory and field or may require a combination of field and laboratory techniques.

===Collections===
The earliest approaches to modern bird study involved the collection of eggs, a practice known as oology. While collecting became a pastime for many amateurs, the labels associated with these early egg collections made them unreliable for the serious study of bird breeding. To preserve eggs, a tiny hole was made and the contents extracted. This technique became standard with the invention of the blow drill around 1830. Egg collection is no longer popular; however, historic museum collections have been of value in determining the effects of pesticides such as DDT on physiology. Museum bird collections continue to act as a resource for taxonomic studies.

The use of bird skins to document species has been a standard part of systematic ornithology. Bird skins are prepared by retaining the key bones of the wings, legs, and skull along with the skin and feathers. In the past, they were treated with arsenic to prevent fungal and insect (mostly dermestid) attack. Arsenic, being toxic, was replaced by less-toxic borax. Amateur and professional collectors became familiar with these skinning techniques and started sending in their skins to museums, some of them from distant locations. This led to the formation of huge collections of bird skins in museums in Europe and North America. Many private collections were also formed. These became references for comparison of species, and the ornithologists at these museums were able to compare species from different locations, often places that they themselves never visited. Morphometrics of these skins, particularly the lengths of the tarsus, bill, tail, and wing became important in the descriptions of bird species. These skin collections have been used in more recent times for studies on molecular phylogenetics by the extraction of ancient DNA. The importance of type specimens in the description of species make skin collections a vital resource for systematic ornithology. However, with the rise of molecular techniques, establishing the taxonomic status of new discoveries, such as the Bulo Burti boubou (&quot;Laniarius liberatus&quot;, no longer a valid species) and the Bugun liocichla (&quot;Liocichla bugunorum&quot;), using blood, DNA and feather samples as the holotype material, has now become possible.

Other methods of preservation include the storage of specimens in spirit. Such wet specimens have special value in physiological and anatomical study, apart from providing better quality of DNA for molecular studies. Freeze drying of specimens is another technique that has the advantage of preserving stomach contents and anatomy, although it tends to shrink, making it less reliable for morphometrics.

===In the field===
The study of birds in the field was helped enormously by improvements in optics. Photography made it possible to document birds in the field with great accuracy. High-power spotting scopes today allow observers to detect minute morphological differences that were earlier possible only by examination of the specimen &quot;in the hand&quot;.

The capture and marking of birds enable detailed studies of life history. Techniques for capturing birds are varied and include the use of bird liming for perching birds, mist nets for woodland birds, cannon netting for open-area flocking birds, the &quot;bal-chatri&quot; trap for raptors, decoys and funnel traps for water birds.

The bird in the hand may be examined and measurements can be made, including standard lengths and weights. Feather moult and skull ossification provide indications of age and health. Sex can be determined by examination of anatomy in some sexually nondimorphic species. Blood samples may be drawn to determine hormonal conditions in studies of physiology, identify DNA markers for studying genetics and kinship in studies of breeding biology and phylogeography. Blood may also be used to identify pathogens and arthropod-borne viruses. Ectoparasites may be collected for studies of coevolution and zoonoses. In many cryptic species, measurements (such as the relative lengths of wing feathers in warblers) are vital in establishing identity. Captured birds are often marked for future recognition. Rings or bands provide long-lasting identification, but require capture for the information on them to be read. Field-identifiable marks such as coloured bands, wing tags, or dyes enable short-term studies where individual identification is required. Mark and recapture techniques make demographic studies possible. Ringing has traditionally been used in the study of migration. In recent times, satellite transmitters provide the ability to track migrating birds in near-real time.

Techniques for estimating population density include point counts, transects, and territory mapping. Observations are made in the field using carefully designed protocols and the data may be analysed to estimate bird diversity, relative abundance, or absolute population densities. These methods may be used repeatedly over large timespans to monitor changes in the environment. Camera traps have been found to be a useful tool for the detection and documentation of elusive species, nest predators and in the quantitative analysis of frugivory, seed dispersal and behaviour.

===In the laboratory===
Many aspects of bird biology are difficult to study in the field. These include the study of behavioural and physiological changes that require a long duration of access to the bird. Nondestructive samples of blood or feathers taken during field studies may be studied in the laboratory. For instance, the variation in the ratios of stable hydrogen isotopes across latitudes makes establishing the origins of migrant birds possible using mass spectrometric analysis of feather samples. These techniques can be used in combination with other techniques such as ringing.

The first attenuated vaccine developed by Louis Pasteur, for fowl cholera, was tested on poultry in 1878. Anti-malarials were tested on birds which harbour avian-malarias. Poultry continues to be used as a model for many studies in non-mammalian immunology.

Studies in bird behaviour include the use of tamed and trained birds in captivity. Studies on bird intelligence and song learning have been largely laboratory-based. Field researchers may make use of a wide range of techniques such as the use of dummy owls to elicit mobbing behaviour, and dummy males or the use of call playback to elicit territorial behaviour and thereby to establish the boundaries of bird territories. Studies of bird migration including aspects of navigation, orientation, and physiology are often studied using captive birds in special cages that record their activities. The Emlen funnel, for instance, makes use of a cage with an inkpad at the centre and a conical floor where the ink marks can be counted to identify the direction in which the bird attempts to fly. The funnel can have a transparent top and visible cues such as the direction of sunlight may be controlled using mirrors or the positions of the stars simulated in a planetarium.

The entire genome of the domestic fowl (&quot;Gallus gallus&quot;) was sequenced in 2004, and was followed in 2008 by the genome of the zebra finch (&quot;Taeniopygia guttata&quot;). Such whole-genome sequencing projects allow for studies on evolutionary processes involved in speciation. Associations between the expression of genes and behaviour may be studied using candidate genes. Variations in the exploratory behaviour of great tits (&quot;Parus major&quot;) have been found to be linked with a gene orthologous to the human gene &quot;DRD4&quot; (Dopamine receptor D4) which is known to be associated with novelty-seeking behaviour. The role of gene expression in developmental differences and morphological variations have been studied in Darwin&#x27;s finches. The difference in the expression of &quot;Bmp4&quot; have been shown to be associated with changes in the growth and shape of the beak.

The chicken has long been a model organism for studying vertebrate developmental biology. As the embryo is readily accessible, its development can be easily followed (unlike mice). This also allows the use of electroporation for studying the effect of adding or silencing a gene. Other tools for perturbing their genetic makeup are chicken embryonic stem cells and viral vectors.

===Collaborative studies===

With the widespread interest in birds, use of a large number of people to work on collaborative ornithological projects that cover large geographic scales has been possible. These citizen science projects include nationwide projects such as the Christmas Bird Count, Backyard Bird Count, the North American Breeding Bird Survey, the Canadian EPOQ or regional projects such as the Asian Waterfowl Census and Spring Alive in Europe. These projects help to identify distributions of birds, their population densities and changes over time, arrival and departure dates of migration, breeding seasonality, and even population genetics. The results of many of these projects are published as bird atlases. Studies of migration using bird ringing or colour marking often involve the cooperation of people and organizations in different countries.

==Applications==

Wild birds impact many human activities, while domesticated birds are important sources of eggs, meat, feathers, and other products. Applied and economic ornithology aim to reduce the ill effects of problem birds and enhance gains from beneficial species.

The role of some species of birds as pests has been well known, particularly in agriculture. Granivorous birds such as the queleas in Africa are among the most numerous birds in the world, and foraging flocks can cause devastation. Many insectivorous birds are also noted as beneficial in agriculture. Many early studies on the benefits or damages caused by birds in fields were made by analysis of stomach contents and observation of feeding behaviour. Modern studies aimed to manage birds in agriculture make use of a wide range of principles from ecology. Intensive aquaculture has brought humans in conflict with fish-eating birds such as cormorants.

Large flocks of pigeons and starlings in cities are often considered as a nuisance, and techniques to reduce their populations or their impacts are constantly innovated. Birds are also of medical importance, and their role as carriers of human diseases such as Japanese encephalitis, West Nile virus, and influenza H5N1 have been widely recognized. Bird strikes and the damage they cause in aviation are of particularly great importance, due to the fatal consequences and the level of economic losses caused. The airline industry incurs worldwide damages of an estimated US$1.2 billion each year.

Many species of birds have been driven to extinction by human activities. Being conspicuous elements of the ecosystem, they have been considered as indicators of ecological health. They have also helped in gathering support for habitat conservation. Bird conservation requires specialized knowledge in aspects of biology and ecology, and may require the use of very location-specific approaches. Ornithologists contribute to conservation biology by studying the ecology of birds in the wild and identifying the key threats and ways of enhancing the survival of species. Critically endangered species such as the California condor have had to be captured and bred in captivity. Such &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation measures may be followed by reintroduction of the species into the wild.

<text>Dodge is an American brand of automobiles and a division of Stellantis North America, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Dodge vehicles have historically included performance cars, and for much of its existence, Dodge was Chrysler&#x27;s mid-priced brand above Plymouth.

Founded as the Dodge Brothers Company machine shop by brothers Horace Elgin Dodge and John Francis Dodge in the early 1900s, Dodge was originally a supplier of parts and assemblies to Detroit-based automakers like Ford. They began building complete automobiles under the &quot;Dodge Brothers&quot; brand in 1914, predating the founding of the Chrysler Corporation. The factory located in Hamtramck, Michigan, was the Dodge main factory from 1910 until it closed in January 1980. John Dodge died from the Spanish flu in January 1920, having lungs weakened by tuberculosis 20 years earlier. Horace died in December of the same year, perhaps weakened by the Spanish flu, but the cause of death was cirrhosis of the liver. Their company was sold by their families to Dillon, Read &amp; Co. in 1925 before being sold to Chrysler in 1928.

Dodge&#x27;s mainstay vehicles were trucks, full-sized passenger cars through the 1970s, and it also built compact cars such as the 1963 through 1976 Dart and midsize as well as such as the &quot;B-Body&quot; Coronet and Charger from 1965 until 1978.

The 1973 oil embargo caused American &quot;gas guzzler&quot; sales to slump, prompting Chrysler to develop the Dodge Aries K platform compact and midsize cars for the 1981 model year. The K platform and its derivatives are credited with reviving Chrysler&#x27;s business in the 1980s. One example was the Dodge Caravan.

The Dodge brand continued through multiple ownership changes of Chrysler Corporation from 1998 until 2009. These included its merger with Daimler-Benz AG between 1998 and 2007. Chrysler was subsequently sold by Daimler-Benz to Cerberus Capital Management. It went through the effects of the 2008–2010 automotive industry crisis on the United States resulting in the Chrysler Chapter 11 reorganization and ultimately being acquired by Fiat.

In 2011, Dodge and its sub-brands, Dodge Ram and Dodge Viper, were separated. Dodge announced that the Viper was to be an SRT product, and Ram a standalone marque. In 2014, SRT was merged back into Dodge. Later that year, the Chrysler Group was renamed FCA US LLC, coinciding with the merger of Fiat S.p.A.. The Chrysler Group was integrated into the corporate structure of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Subsequently, another merger occurred on January 16, 2021, between FCA and the PSA Group to form Stellantis, making the Dutch-domiciled automaker the second largest in Europe, after Volkswagen.

==History==
===Founding and early years===
Horace and John Dodge founded the &quot;Dodge Brothers Company&quot; in Detroit in 1900, and quickly found work manufacturing precision engine and chassis components for the city&#x27;s growing number of automobile firms. Chief among them were the established Olds Motor Vehicle Company and the new Ford Motor Company. Henry Ford selected the Dodge brothers to supply a wide range of components for his original Model A (1903–04) comprising the entire chassis: Ford needed to add only the body and wheels to finish the cars. Henry offered the Dodge brothers a 10% share in his new company in return for $10,000 worth of goods ($ in dollars). In 1902, the brothers won a contract to produce transmissions for Ransom E. Olds&#x27; company, Oldsmobile upon which they built a solid reputation for quality and service. They rejected a second contract from Oldsmobile in 1903, to retool their plant to manufacture engines for the Ford Motor Company, which would be in debt to the brothers.

The first machine shop where the brothers worked as parts suppliers for Olds and Ford was located at the Boydell Building on Beaubien Street at Lafayette. This location was replaced by a larger facility at Hastings Street and Monroe Avenue, which is now a parking garage for the Hollywood Casino (Hastings Street at this location has been renamed Chrysler Service Drive). By 1910 the Dodge Main factory was built in Hamtramck, where it remained until 1979.

The Dodge Brothers Motor Company was established in 1913 and by 1914, John and Horace designed and introduced the first car of their own – the four-cylinder Dodge Model 30-35 touring car. Marketed as a slightly more upscale competitor to the ubiquitous Ford Model T, it pioneered or made standard many features later taken for granted, such as all-steel bodies. The vast majority of cars worldwide still used wood-framing under steel panels, Other innovations were 12-volt electrical systems (6-volt systems would remain the norm until the 1950s), 35 horsepower engines versus the Model T&#x27;s 20 horsepower, and sliding-gear transmission (the best-selling Model T retained an antiquated planetary design until its demise in 1927). John Dodge was quoted as saying, &quot;Someday, people who own a Ford are going to want an automobile.&quot; The company garnered a reputation for the highest quality truck, transmission, and motor parts supplied to other successful vehicles, and Dodge Brothers cars were ranked second in U.S. sales as early as 1916.

That same year, Henry Ford stopped paying stock dividends to finance the construction of his new River Rouge complex, and the Dodges filed a suit to protect their annual dividends of approximately one million dollars, leading Ford to buy out his shareholders. The Dodges were paid some US$25 million.($ in dollars) They had already earned $9,871,500 ($ in dollars) in dividends making a total return of $34,871,500 ($ in dollars) on their original $10,000 ($ in dollars) investment. The Ford contract set them up for life, but they never got to spend it.

Also in 1916, the Dodge Brothers vehicles won acclaim for their durability in military service. First with the U.S. Army&#x27;s Pancho Villa Expedition, during the 1910s U.S. Mexico Border War—the U.S. military&#x27;s first operation to use truck convoys. General &quot;Blackjack&quot; Pershing procured a fleet of 150 to 250 Dodge Brothers vehicles for the Mexico campaign. Touring cars were used as staff and reconnaissance vehicles. Pershing himself used a Dodge touring car to keep abreast of army columns and control their movements.

During an incident in May, the 6th Infantry reported a sighting of Julio Cárdenas, one of Villa&#x27;s most trusted subordinates. Lt. George S. Patton led ten soldiers and two civilian guides in three Dodge Model 30 touring cars to conduct America&#x27;s first motorized military raid at a ranch house in San Miguelito, Sonora. During the ensuing firefight, the party killed three men, with one identified as Cárdenas. Patton&#x27;s men tied the bodies to the hoods of the Dodges, returning to headquarters in Dublán and an excited reception from US newspapermen.

Subsequently, some 12,800 Dodge cars and light trucks were used in World War I—over 8,000 touring cars, as well as 2,600 commercial vehicles, such as screen-side trucks and panel vans—serving primarily as ambulances and repair trucks.

Dodge remained the United States military&#x27;s primary supplier of light-wheeled vehicles until the U.S. joined the Second World War.

===Dodge brothers death and sale to Chrysler===

Dodge Brothers cars continued to rank second place in American sales in 1920. However, the same year John Dodge died of pneumonia in January. His brother Horace then died of cirrhosis in December of the same year (reportedly still grieved over the loss of his brother, to whom he was very close). With the loss of both founders, the Dodge Brothers Company was left in the hands of their widows, Matilda Dodge Wilson and Anna Thompson Dodge, who promoted long-time employee Frederick Haynes to the presidency. During this time, the Model 30 was evolved to become the Series 116 (retaining the same basic construction and engineering features). As the 1920s progressed, Dodge gradually lost its ranking from the third-best-selling automaker to seventh place in the U.S. market.

Dodge Brothers expanded its truck line and became a leading builder of light trucks. After expanding production capacity, Haynes signed a contract in 1921 for Dodge&#x27;s large dealer network to exclusively market trucks with bodies built by Graham Brothers of Evansville, Indiana. The Graham truck line from then on used only Dodge-built chassis, from 1-ton to 3-ton capacity, and Dodge kept making light-duty trucks.

Development was stagnating, and sales dropped Dodge Brothers to fifth place in the industry by 1925. That year, the Dodge Brothers company was sold by the widows to the investment group Dillon, Read &amp; Co. for no less than US$146 million which at the time was the largest cash transaction in history ($ in dollars).

Dillon, Read &amp; Co. offered non-voting stock on the market in the new Dodge Brothers firm, and along with the sale of bonds was able to raise $160 million ($ in dollars), reaping a $14 million (net) profit ($ in dollars). All voting stock was retained by Dillon, Read. Frederick Haynes remained as company head until E.G. Wilmer was named board chairman in November 1926. Wilmer was a banker with no auto experience and Haynes remained as president. Changes to the car, save for superficial things like trim levels and colors, remained minimal until 1927, when the new Senior six-cylinder line was introduced. The four-cylinder line was renamed the Fast Four line until it was dropped in favor of two lighter six-cylinder models (the Standard Six and Victory Six) for 1928.

On October 1, 1925, Dodge Brothers, Inc., acquired a 51% interest in Graham Brothers, Inc., for $13 million ($ in dollars) and the remaining 49% on May 1, 1926. Haynes purchased all of Graham&#x27;s truck production, and in 1926, the Graham branch took charge of all of Dodge&#x27;s truck manufacturing. Briefly – until the purchase by Chrysler – all trucks were Graham badged. A total of 60,000 trucks were built in 1927. The three Graham brothers, Robert, Joseph and Ray, assumed management positions in Dodge Brothers before departing early in 1927. The brothers established the Graham-Paige company to build a new line of Graham passenger cars.

Despite this, Dodge Brothers&#x27; sales had dropped to thirteenth place in the industry by 1927 selling the Dodge Fast Four, and Dillon, Read began looking for someone to buy the company. Dodge was sold to the new Chrysler Corporation in 1928 in a stock transfer instead of cash for $170 million ($ in dollars) who had attempted to purchase Dodge two years earlier. Chrysler successfully purchased Dodge to gain the Dodge Factory and dealership network to better compete in the low-priced car field against Ford and Chevrolet, and in one year Dodge progressed from thirteenth place in sales to seventh place by 1928. On January 2, 1929, Chrysler announced that the Graham Badge was dropped, and Chrysler was now building Dodge Brothers trucks.

===Pre-war years===


To fit better the Chrysler Corporation lineup, alongside low-priced Plymouth and medium-priced DeSoto, Dodge&#x27;s lineup for early 1930 was trimmed down to a core group of two lines and thirteen models (from three lines and nineteen models just over a year previous). Prices started just above DeSoto but were somewhat less than top-of-the-line Chrysler, in a small-scale recreation of General Motors&#x27; &quot;step-up&quot; marketing concept. (DeSoto and Dodge would swap places in the market for the 1933 model year, Dodge dropping down between Plymouth and DeSoto.) As Plymouth cars were sold at Chrysler dealerships, Dodge branded vehicles were sold as a lower-cost alternative to DeSoto.

For 1930, Dodge took another step up by adding a new eight-cylinder line to replace the existing Senior six-cylinder. This basic format of a dual line with Six and Eight models continued through 1933, and the cars were gradually streamlined and lengthened in step with prevailing trends of the day. The Dodge Eight was replaced by a larger Dodge DeLuxe Six for 1934, which was dropped for 1935. A long-wheelbase edition of the remaining Six was added for 1936 and would remain a part of the lineup for many years. To enhance production, in 1932 Chrysler built a factory in Los Angeles, California where Chrysler, DeSoto, Dodge, and Plymouth vehicles were built until the factory closed in 1971.

The Dodge line, along with most of the corporation&#x27;s output, was restyled in the so-called &quot;Wind Stream&quot; look for 1935. This was a mild form of streamlining, which saw sales jump remarkably over the previous year (even though Dodge as a whole still dropped to fifth place for the year after two years of holding down fourth). Dodge did not share the radical Airflow styling that was the cause of depressed sales of Chryslers and DeSotos from 1934 until 1937, as a passenger sedan, but it was used on commercial trucks for a short time. Dodge (along with the rest of Chrysler) added safety features such as a smooth, flat dashboard with no protruding knobs, curved in-door handles, and padded front-seat backs for the benefit of the rear-seat occupants.

Another major restyle arrived for the 25th-anniversary 1939 models, which Dodge dubbed the Luxury Liner series. These were once again completely redesigned, with new bodies for 1940, again in 1941, and a refreshing for 1942. However, just after the 1942 models were introduced, Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor forced the shutdown of Dodge&#x27;s passenger car assembly lines in favor of war production in February 1942. 1941 saw the introduction of Fluid Drive for Dodge cars, which eliminated stalling or bucking if the clutch was released too quickly. This feature put a fluid coupling in between the engine and the clutch, although the driver still had to shift gears manually.

===World War II===
Chrysler was prolific in its production of war materiel, especially from 1942 until 1945. Dodge in particular was well known to both average citizens and thankful soldiers for their tough military-spec light trucks and WC54 ambulances. Dodge America – on paper under the Fargo Trucks name (in U.S. government contracts) – built over 400,000 trucks for the war, in its nearly new (1938) Warren truck plant at Mound Road, near Detroit, Michigan. Starting with the quickly converted VC and VF-series of 1940, Dodge built mostly light 4x4, but also light-medium 6x6 WC-series trucks, that evolved out of the VC-series. Smaller numbers of other models were built for China and Russia under Lend-Lease. Additionally, Chrysler Canada was enlisted to crank out another 180,000 Dodge trucks for the British and the Commonwealth militaries, over three-quarters of which were 3-ton trucks to be used in the CMP role.

Dodge readily built upon the reputation of the WC-series for itself, by carrying it over into civilian models after the war, beginning with the successful Power Wagon, introduced with minimal modification almost immediately after the war, in 1945, for the 1946 model year.

===Post-war years===

Civilian production at Dodge was restarted by late 1945, in time for the 1946 model year. The &quot;seller&#x27;s market&quot; of the early postwar years, brought on by the lack of any new cars throughout the war, meant that every automaker found it easy to sell vehicles regardless of any drawbacks they might have. Like almost every other automaker, Dodge sold lightly facelifted revisions of its 1942 design through the 1948 season. As before, these were a single series of six-cylinder models with two trim levels (basic Deluxe or plusher Custom). From 1949 until 1954, Fluid Drive could be combined with &quot;Gyro-Matic,&quot; a semi-automatic transmission that reduced (but did not eliminate) the need to shift gears.

Styling was not initially Dodge&#x27;s strong point during this period, but began to change by 1953 under the direction of corporate design chief Virgil Exner. However, the deluxe Coronet series, introduced for 1949, offered extra luxury as the top-of-the-line. The Coronet Diplomat, Dodge&#x27;s first pillarless hardtop coupe, was new for 1950, at least one year before Ford, Plymouth, and other popular car makes offered it. At the same time, Dodge also introduced its first V8 engine – the Red Ram Hemi, a smaller version of the original design of the famed Chrysler Hemi. The new 1953 bodies were smaller and based on the Plymouth. For 1954, sales dropped, and the stubby styling did not go over well with the public. 1954 also saw the introduction of the fully automatic PowerFlite transmission.

Chrysler borrowed $250 million ($2,518,310,099.13 in 2021 Dollars) from Prudential in 1954 to finance expansion, acquisition, and updating the outdated styling of their car lines that contributed to Chrysler&#x27;s failure to benefit from the postwar boom as GM and Ford were.

Exner led the development of the new corporate &quot;Forward Look&quot; styling of 1955, beginning a new era for Dodge. With steadily upgraded styling and ever-stronger engines every year through 1960, Dodge found a ready market for its products as America discovered the joys of freeway travel. This situation improved when Dodge introduced a new line of Dodges called the Dart to do battle against Ford, Chevrolet, and Plymouth. The result was that Dodge sales in the middle price class collapsed. Special and regional models were sold as well, including the LaFemme (a white and orchid-trimmed hardtop marketed toward women) and the Texan, a gold-accented Dodge sold in the Lone Star State. 1957 saw the introduction of a new automatic transmission, three-speed TorqueFlite. Both PowerFlite and TorqueFlite were controlled by mechanical push-buttons until 1965. 1956 saw the introduction of the 4-door pillarless hardtop (the same year most other makes offered this body style) in all three Dodge series, Custom Royal, Royal, and Coronet. Dodge&#x27;s pillarless models were all badged &quot;Lancer.&quot;
Dodge entered the compact car field for the 1961 model year with the Lancer, a variation on Plymouth&#x27;s Valiant. It was not initially successful but the successor, the 1963 Dart range would prove to be one of the division&#x27;s top sellers for many years.

Chrysler made an ill-advised move to downsize the Dodge and Plymouth full-size lines for 1962, which resulted in a loss of sales. However, they turned this around in 1965 by turning those former full-sizes into &quot;new&quot; mid-size models; Dodge revived the Coronet nameplate in this way and later added a sporty fastback version called the Charger that became both a sales leader and a winner on the NASCAR circuit. This style dominated the racetracks for four years and the aerodynamic improvements changed the face of NASCAR racing.

Full-size models evolved gradually during this time. After Dodge dealers complained about not having a true full-size car in the fall of 1961, the Custom 880 was hurried into production. The Custom 880 used the 1962 Chrysler Newport body with the 1961 Dodge front end and interior. The 880 continued into 1965, the year a completely new full-size body was put into production, the Polara entered the medium price class and the Monaco was added as the top series. The Polara and Monaco were changed mostly in appearance for the next ten years or so. Unique &quot;fuselage&quot; styling was employed from 1969 through 1973 and then was toned down again for the 1974 through 1977 models.

Dodge targeted the muscle car market of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Along with the Charger, models like the Coronet R/T and Super Bee were available for buyers seeking performance. Dodge entered the pony car market segment with the Challenger coupe and convertible for the 1970 model year. They were available with economy I6 engines and numerous trims and options up to the &quot;race-ready&quot; Hemi V8.

To offer a wider range of cars during the 1970s, Dodge partnered with Mitsubishi Motors to marketed their subcompact as the Colt positioned to compete with the AMC Gremlin, Chevrolet Vega, and Ford Pinto. Chrysler would come to rely heavily on their relationship with Mitsubishi. At the same time, Dodge marketed a version of the Plymouth Duster, badge-engineered as the Dodge Demon. It was inexpensive, but with I6 and V8 engines, the Demon could not achieve the fuel economy of the four-cylinder Colt. The Demon sold in much fewer numbers than the Duster.

=== 1973–1980 ===

The 1973 oil crisis caused significant changes at Dodge, as well as Chrysler as a whole. Except for the Colt and Slant Six models of the Dart, Dodge&#x27;s lineup was viewed as uneconomical. Although this problem affected American automakers, Chrysler did not have the resources to respond to the changes in the marketplace. While General Motors and Ford began downsizing their largest cars, Chrysler (and Dodge) were slow to make change.

Chrysler was able to use some of its other resources. Borrowing the recently introduced Chrysler Horizon from their European division, Dodge was able to get its new Omni subcompact on the market fairly quickly. At the same time, they increased the number of models imported from Japanese partner Mitsubishi starting in 1971: first was a smaller Colt (based on Mitsubishi&#x27;s Galant line), then a revival of the Challenger (Dodge Challenger) in 1976 as a compact two-door hardtop with a four-cylinder engine.

The 1975 model year had the Dodge Charger and Chrysler Cordoba share the same new body based on the B platform. The Chrysler Cordoba had replaced the Plymouth Satellite Sebring. The Charger SE (Special Edition) was the only model offered. It came with a wide variety engines from the &quot;LA&quot; series small block V8 to three versions of big block V8. The standard engine was the 2-bbl small block, along with the code E58 4-bbl and dual exhaust high-performance version (225 hp) available as an option. Sales in 1975 amounted to 30,812.

1976 was the Dart&#x27;s final year in the North American market. The rear-view mirror was mounted on the windshield rather than from the roof. Front disc brakes became standard equipment on January 1, 1976 in accord with more stringent U.S. federal brake performance requirements, and a new foot-operated parking brake replaced the under-dash T-handle used since the Dart&#x27;s 1963 introduction as a compact car. The grille&#x27;s parking lamps were cast in amber, whereas the previous years had clear lenses with amber-colored bulbs. The Dart Sport 360 was dropped as a separate model in 1976, but the four-barrel, dual exhaust (without catalytic converters) V8 was a $376 option (except in California) for the $3,370 Dart Sport V8 models with automatic transmission. &quot;Car &amp; Driver&quot; magazine tested the Dart Sport 360 in the April 1976 issue, pitting it against the Chevrolet Corvette and Pontiac Trans Am, and found its top speed of to be second to the Corvette&#x27;s .

Dodge&#x27;s replacement for the Dart was the Aspen, introduced in mid-1975 as a 1976 model. This new design featured lighter weight resulting in slightly improved fuel economy; it also had more interior and trunk room than the Dart. Front suspension was a new design; it featured transverse-mounted torsion bars which not only improved ride, but cornering as well. Its boxy styling gave the impression of a larger car. However, sales had to be shared with the virtually identical Plymouth Volare. Both cars were available in coupe, sedan, and station wagon body styles, and in both base and deluxe trim. Despite its virtues, customers soon found out about the Aspen&#x27;s rush to market when they saw their cars experience severe body rust within a couple of years on the road; engine and drive train problems plagued the Aspen/Volare twins, and although the problems were largely worked out within a few years, the final Aspens were the 1980 models. This car was available with either a 225 cubic-inch Slant Six or a small block V8 displacing 318 or 360 cubic inches.

1976 was the final model year for the Dodge Coronet, at least so far as the name Coronet went, also its body style choices were relegated to just only two four-door models, the four-door wagon and the four-door sedan. The former Dodge Coronet 2-door model, which appeared for just the previous model year was replaced by the Dodge Charger Sport 2-door model, which, itself, appeared for only one model year. During the next model year (1977), the mid-size Dodge Coronet would be renamed Monaco, which would be given stacked rectangular headlights and other minor cosmetic changes, that would provide a prompt sales boost. The Coronet and Charger were effectively replaced by the Diplomat for 1977, which was a fancier Aspen.

Also, during that same model year, the full-size Dodge Monaco would be renamed Dodge Royal Monaco, which would appear for just one model year only and after that, both Dodge and Plymouth (which would include Dodge Royal Monaco&#x27;s entire Plymouth Gran Fury counterpart line up as well) would discontinue all production of any more full-size models. It lost sales every year until replaced by the St. Regis for 1979 following a one-year absence from the big car market. In a reversal of what happened in 1965, the St. Regis was an upsized Coronet. During the following model year (1978), the mid-size Dodge Monaco (which would include its entire Plymouth Fury counterpart lineup as well) would make its final appearance (for all during the remainder of the 1970s).

While the Aspen got accolades for styling and handling, the build quality was problematic, sullying the car&#x27;s reputation at a time when sales were desperately needed. It was noted for having problems with its carburetors which resulted in frequent stalling. The Aspen also had difficulties in starting, even after leaving the engine off for several minutes. This resulted in several recalls.

The Dodge Magnum was introduced for 1978 to supplement the Dodge Charger. It was sold in two forms, the &quot;XE&quot; and the &quot;GT&quot; and was the last vehicle to use the long-running Chrysler B platform. The appearance was somewhat of a rounded-off Charger and was in response to getting a car that would be eligible for NASCAR that would be more aerodynamic, something that the 1975–1978 Charger was not. Styling features included four rectangular headlights behind retractable clear covers, with narrow opera windows, and an optional T-bar or power sunroof. The Magnum was well-featured with power steering, brakes, and seats; the suspension included Chrysler&#x27;s standard adjustable, longitudinal torsion bars, lower trailing links, and front and rear anti-sway bars. The base engine was the V8 with Lean-Burn, while two and four-barrel carbureted and V8s were optional; weight was nearly .
The Omni and Horizon were introduced at a critical time since the company was on the brink of bankruptcy and sought government support to survive. In 1978, Chrysler beat Ford and General Motors to the market with a domestically produced front-wheel drive car to challenge the VW Rabbit. However, the L-bodies miscarried at first, since 1978 was a year of strong sales for larger cars and demand for compacts and subcompacts noticeably shrank. These initial poor sales of the cars contributed to Chrysler&#x27;s financial woes at the time, but when the company requested federal assistance, the Omni was an important piece of evidence that they were attempting to compete with imports and build small, fuel-efficient cars and might be worth saving. For the three years leading up to the introduction of Chrysler&#x27;s K-cars, the Omni/Horizon was Chrysler&#x27;s best-selling model line.

Everything came to a head in 1979 when Chrysler&#x27;s new chairman, Lee Iacocca, requested and received federal loan guarantees from the United States Congress to save the company from having to file for bankruptcy. With a Federal Loan in hand, Chrysler quickly set to work on new models that would leave the past behind, while reorganizing to pay the government loan which stood at 29%.

The Dodge Mirada was a mid-sized, rear-wheel drive coupe manufactured and marketed by Dodge from the 1980 through 1983 model years, sharing the Chrysler J platform along with its badge engineered variants, the second generation Chrysler Cordoba and the Imperial. Production of the Mirada reached just under 53,000 units, staying relatively unchanged over four years of production, except for paint colors and engines. The Mirada was marketed as a sporty personal luxury car with limited advertising and marketing during a period when Chrysler was in deep financial difficulty.

=== 1981–1990 ===
The first fruit of Chrysler&#x27;s crash development program was the &quot;K-Car&quot;, the Dodge version of which was the Dodge Aries. This basic and durable front-wheel drive platform spawned a whole range of new models at Dodge during the 1980s, including the groundbreaking Dodge Caravan. Lee Iacocca and Hal Sperlich developed their idea for this type of vehicle during their tenure at Ford Motor Company. Henry Ford II rejected the idea (and a prototype) of a minivan in 1974. Iacocca followed Sperlich to Chrysler, and together they created what was internally designated the T-115 minivan – a prototype that was to become the Caravan and Voyager, known in initial marketing as the Magic-wagons. Chrysler introduced the Dodge Caravan and the Plymouth Voyager in November 1983 for the 1984 model year, using the Chrysler S platform, an extended derivative of the Chrysler K platform. The Caravan not only helped save Chrysler as a serious high-volume American automaker, but also spawned an entirely new market segment that supplanted the role of the station wagon: the minivan.

By 1981, Chrysler was switching to smaller front-wheel drive designs. However, its older and larger rear-wheel drive Dodge Diplomat (as well as the Chrysler LeBaron and Fifth Avenue) continued to sell. Diplomats built from mid-1988 until the end of production were among the first Chrysler-built products to have a driver&#x27;s side airbag as standard equipment, some two model years before the remainder of Chrysler&#x27;s lineup (they were also among the only cars at the time to offer a tilt steering column with an airbag). As the 1980s progressed, fewer private customers purchased the Diplomat, and the M-body was eventually dropped during the 1989 model year. Although sales were strong, Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca held a low opinion of the M-body line as a relic of the pre-K car era and declined to invest any money in them. 
Dodge would not market another truly full-size car (at least based upon United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) passenger volume statistics) until the Monaco debuted as a 1990 model.

The Daytona originally used the 2.2 L Chrysler K engine in normally aspirated (93 hp) or turbocharged (142 hp) form. The 100 hp 2.5 L K engine was added for 1986. In 1985, the 2.2 L Turbo I engine&#x27;s horsepower was increased to . The 1984 Daytona was available in three trim lines: standard, Turbo, and Turbo Z. Total production was 49,347. The Daytona Turbo was on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s 10Best list for 1984. Both the Daytona and Chrysler Laser were available with the Chrysler electronic voice alert system through 1987. A performance-oriented &quot;Shelby&quot; version of the Daytona was introduced in 1987. For 1987, the Daytona was restyled externally and featured pop-up headlights. New in 1987 was a &quot;Shelby Z&quot; trim level with an available Chrysler developed Turbo II ( – ) intercooled version of the 2.2 L Chrysler K engine, as well as a heavy-duty A555 transaxle with Getrag gears. The Shelby Z also featured numerous suspension upgrades, including a larger diameter front sway bar and disc brakes on all four wheels. This version was sold in Europe under the name &quot;Chrysler GS Turbo II&quot;. A more luxury-oriented &quot;Pacifica&quot; trim line was also added to replace the Chrysler Laser, which was dropped in mid-year 1986. Among the optional equipment included a leather interior, an eight-way power enthusiast driver&#x27;s seat (with mechanical thigh and lumbar controls), a digital instrument cluster, and a 12-button trip computer (with instant fuel ratings as well as trip averages and estimated travel times).


The Dodge Dynasty is related to the Chrysler New Yorker as both car lines were built on the Chrysler C platform in Belvidere, Illinois. Dynasty trim levels included base and LE. Additionally, a &quot;Brougham&quot; package was offered on 1992–93 LE models that added a padded &quot;landau&quot; vinyl roof. When the new front-wheel-drive Chrysler Corporation C-body cars (Dynasty and New Yorker) debuted for the 1988 model year, they were the first mass-produced cars in the world to have a fully multiplexed, fiber-optic wiring buss connecting all electronic accessories and controllers. The new electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission, known as the Ultradrive or A604 (List of Chrysler transmissions), debuted in 1989, and became the sole transmission for V6 models through the 1993 final production year of the Dynasty. The vast majority of Dynasties sold to private customers had V6 engines; four-cylinder models mostly went to the fleet market.

Through the late 1980s and 1990s, Dodge&#x27;s designation as the sporty-car division was backed by a succession of high-performance and/or aggressively styled models including the:
*Daytona
*600 
*Performance variants of the Lancer
*Viper

=== 1990s ===


The Omni and the Horizon ended production in 1990, and were replaced by the Dodge Shadow/Plymouth Sundance, which were both introduced for 1987. Both the Monaco and Premier were discontinued during the 1992 model year. However, its state-of-the-art manufacturing plant and the key executive from American Motors behind the Premier/Monaco design, François Castaing, would lead to the successful and highly rated &quot;cab-forward&quot; LH Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde, and Eagle Vision versions in late 1992 when production resumed at Brampton Assembly.

Dodge-branded Mitsubishi vehicles were phased out by 1993 except for the Dodge Stealth running through 1996. However, Mitsubishi-made engines and electrical components were still widely used in American domestic Chrysler products.

In 1992, Dodge moved their performance orientation forward substantially with the Viper, which featured an aluminum V10 engine and composite sports roadster body. This was the first step in what was marketed as &quot;The New Dodge&quot;, which was an aggressive advertising campaign with a litany of new models, with television ads narrated by Edward Herrmann that pointed out the innovations in the vehicles and challenged their competitors. Also, he would go on to serve as the brand&#x27;s spokesperson for the rest of the decade.

Later that year was the introduction of the new Intrepid sedan, substantially different from its boxy Dynasty predecessor. The Intrepid used what Chrysler called &quot;cab forward&quot; styling, with the wheels pushed out to the corners of the chassis for maximum passenger space. The Intrepid was available in two trim levels: base and the sportier, better-equipped ES, which added four-wheel disc brakes, 16-inch wheels with better tires, and stiffer &quot;touring&quot; suspension damping. All Intrepids received driver and front passenger airbags, a rarity at the time, as well as air conditioning and the four-speed automatic transmission. Anti-lock brakes were optional, as was traction control, and the more powerful 3.5 L SOHC engine rated at (214 hp).

In 1994, the new second-generation Dodge Ram pickup was introduced with bold styling that departed radically from the boxy designs of trucks made by the Big Three for two decades prior. The second-generation Ram began development in 1986. The original concept, dubbed the &quot;Louisville Slugger&quot; by Chrysler&#x27;s Advanced Packaging Studio, was to be a modular platform that would accommodate a full-size truck and full-size van, which would have provided a roomy cab and cargo bed. The design featured a big-rig-looking front end and a large grille that was deemed risky at its introduction, but ultimately proved popular with consumers. The redesigned 1994 Ram was a sales success and was named &quot;Truck of the Year&quot; by &quot;Motor Trend&quot; in 1994. Sales increased from 95,542 units in 1993 to 232,092 in 1994, 410,000 in 1995, and 411,000 by 1996. That year, it was prominently featured as the hero vehicle in the film &quot;Twister&quot;. Sales of this generation peaked at just over 400,000 in 1999 before declining against the redesigned Ford and GM trucks.

They followed up on this idea on a smaller scale with the Neon and Stratus. The Dodge Stratus was the middle entry of the Chrysler JA platform (with the Cirrus being the higher-end model and the Breeze being the lower-end model). The three cars differed only in the front fascia, rear bumper, taillights, and wheels. The interiors also had little variation between the three models; being almost identical, save for the name on the steering wheel, and a few available options. The Stratus directly replaced the high-volume Spirit (United States only). The Stratus, Plymouth Breeze, and Chrysler Cirrus were all on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for 1996 and 1997. It received critical acclaim at launch, but ratings fell over time.

The car was badged and sold as both a Dodge and a Plymouth in the United States and Canada; in Mexico was sold as Dodge and Chrysler, and in Europe, Australia and other export markets it was sold as the Chrysler Neon. At the Neon&#x27;s release, then president of Chrysler Corporation Bob Lutz said, &quot;There&#x27;s an old saying in Detroit: &#x27;Good, fast, or cheap. Pick any two.&#x27; We refuse to accept that.&quot; The Japanese press touted the Neon as the &quot;Japanese car killer&quot;, due to a spiraling Yen and the lower production cost of the Neon. The Neon received praise for its appearance, price, and power when compared to competing cars such as the Honda Civic DX at , the Civic EX at , the Nissan Sentra at , the Ford Escort ZX2 at , the Toyota Corolla at , the Saturn S-Series at for SOHC variants and for DOHC variants, and the Chevrolet Cavalier Base and LS models at , among others.

The Dodge Durango is a mid-size sport utility vehicle (SUV) produced by Dodge. The first two generations were very similar in that both were based on the Dodge Dakota, both featured a body-on-frame construction and both were produced at the Newark Assembly Plant in Newark, Delaware. The Durango was marketed as a sturdy truck-based SUV designed to hold up to seven passengers and tow up to when properly equipped. The Durango shared a front end, instrument panel, and front seats with the Dakota pickup on which it was based. Original designs of the eight-passenger Durango featured a rear-facing third-row similar to many older station wagons. To make room for a more practical forward-facing third row, Dodge shortened the length of the front doors and raised the roof two inches (5 cm) beyond the front seats, allowing for stadium seating. The Durango&#x27;s roof rack was designed to mask the appearance of the raised roof.

===The modern era: 1998–present===
====DaimlerChrysler and private ownership====
In a move that never lived up to the expectations of its driving forces, Chrysler Corporation merged with Daimler-Benz AG in 1998 to form DaimlerChrysler. Rationalizing Chrysler&#x27;s broad lineup was a priority, Dodge&#x27;s sister brand Plymouth was withdrawn from the market. With this move, Dodge became DaimlerChrysler&#x27;s low-price division as well as its performance division.

The Intrepid, Stratus, and Neon updates of the 1998 to 2000 timeframe were largely complete before Daimler&#x27;s presence, and Dodge&#x27;s first experience of any platform sharing with the German side of the company was the 2005 Magnum station wagon, introduced as a replacement for the Intrepid. Featuring Chrysler&#x27;s first mainstream rear-wheel drive platform since the 1980s and a revival of the Hemi V8 engine. The Charger was launched in 2006 on the same platform.

In 2000, the Stratus became the last of the surviving Cloud Cars, with the Cirrus renamed as the Sebring, and the Breeze discontinued (along with the Plymouth brand).

This generation of the Dodge Stratus was not sold in Canada, although 1999 was the last year for Dodge Stratus sales in Canada. 2002 models dropped the &quot;DODGE&quot; badges from the doors. During this time, sales declined as its ratings from consumer and auto magazines fell below average among mid-size cars, while the sedan market had shifted and pushed the larger Intrepid and later Charger to record sales. 2004 brought styling revisions, which did not reverse this trend. The Stratus was discontinued in May 2006 (the Sebring name was continued). 
The Dodge Avenger name returned in February 2007 as a 2008 model year sedan to replace the Dodge Stratus, whose coupe version had replaced the original Avenger in 2001. According to some reports, the Avenger, along with the redesigned Chrysler Sebring, shares a DaimlerChrysler/Mitsubishi Motors platform called JS which used the Mitsubishi GS as a starting point. The base engine in the SE and SXT trim levels was the 2.4 L GEMA I4 naturally aspirated &quot;World Engine&quot;, a joint venture between DaimlerChrysler, Mitsubishi, and Hyundai. Additional engines included an optional 2.7 L V6 in the SXT and a standard 3.5 L V6 in the R/T trim level. In addition to the 2.4 L &quot;World Engine&quot; and the V6s, export vehicles were offered with the 2.0 L naturally aspirated &quot;World Engine&quot;, as well as a 2.0 L turbocharged diesel (Pumpe-Düse) made by Volkswagen. As a 2008 model, the Dodge Avenger came to showrooms in February 2007.

Further cost savings were explored in the form of an extensive platform-sharing arrangement with Mitsubishi, which spawned the Caliber subcompact as a replacement for the Neon, and the Avenger sedan. The rear-drive chassis was then used in early 2008 to build a new Challenger, with styling reminiscent of the original 1970 Challenger. Like its predecessor, the new Challenger coupe was available with a V8 engine (base models featured a V6). In Spring 2007, DaimlerChrysler reached an agreement with Cerberus Capital Management to sell its Chrysler Group subsidiary, of which the Dodge division was a part. Soon after, the housing bubble began to collapse the American market, and on May 1, 2009, Chrysler and GM filed for bankruptcy on the same day.

====Fiat ownership====
On June 10, 2009, Italian automaker Fiat formed a partnership with Chrysler under Sergio Marchionne, with the UAW, and the US Government to form Chrysler Group LLC, of which Dodge remained fully integrated. For its part, the US Government provided more than $6 billion in loans at 21%, called a &quot;bridge loan&quot; or &quot;bailout&quot;. The newly formed company went on to fully repay that loan, remortgaging to reduce the interest rate several times down to 6%. They fully paid back the loan with interest to the U.S. Government on May 24, 2011, a full five years early. The UAW, being partners throughout the process, were paid well and above $3.9 billion in 2013 as Sergio&#x27;s plan for full consolidation has continued on schedule. This has allowed Chrysler LLC to fully merge with Fiat to form FCA, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, in 2014. The combined company will be based in London.

In 2013, Dodge reintroduced a compact car based on an Alfa Romeo design called the Dart. It was the first new Dodge model produced under FCA.

On May 6, 2014, FCA announced a major restructuring, in which Dodge would focus solely on performance vehicles and will be positioned between Chrysler (which is moving downmarket into mainstream vehicles) and a relaunched Alfa Romeo (making its return to North America after a 20-year absence) in the FCA lineup. This is a setup similar to PSA Peugeot Citroën, which positions Peugeot as its mainstream brand while Citroën is more performance-based, as well as Hyundai Motor Group having its two mainstream brands, Kia Motors and Hyundai Motor Company focusing on performance and mid-luxury, respectively. (Among the American press, it has drawn comparisons to the decades-long positioning of Chevrolet and Pontiac at General Motors before the phase-out of Pontiac in 2010.) As part of the restructuring, Dodge will discontinue the Dodge Grand Caravan (after 32 years) and Dodge Avenger without replacements, while launching a sporty subcompact below the Dart in 2018. Additionally, while the Ram Trucks division will remain separate (although the Dodge Durango will remain in production as a Dodge), the SRT division was merged back into Dodge.

On July 8, 2020, FCA announced that Dodge will shift its focus to a performance marque offering three core brands, Charger, Challenger, and Durango, starting with the 2021 model year. Both the Journey and Grand Caravan were discontinued with the 2020 model year models.

==Dodge trucks==
Over the decades, Dodge has become well known for its passenger car output, along with its many truck models, but after almost a century of manufacturing these vehicles, a decision was made to spin off Dodge&#x27;s trucks into a separate Ram brand, based on the popularity of their top-selling truck, the Dodge Ram. Although the Ram trucks are marketed separately from Dodge cars, Ram President Fred Diaz has said:

Ram trucks will always and forever be Dodges. Ram will always have the Dodge emblem inside and outside and they will be &quot;&#x27;vinned&#x27;&quot; (from the acronym VIN, or Vehicle Identification Number) as a Dodge. We need to continue to market as Ram so Dodge can have a different brand identity: hip, cool, young, energetic. That will not fit the campaign for truck buyers. The two should have distinct themes.

===Pickups and medium to heavy trucks===

Ever since Dodge began building their cars in 1914, the company also offered light truck models. Initially, these were largely based on the existing passenger cars, but eventually gained their own chassis and body designs as the market matured. During the 1930s and 1940s, light- and medium-duty models were offered at first, then a heavy-duty range was added. The very large, new Warren Truck Assembly plant was built in Michigan, just north of Detroit, and opened in 1938, producing Dodge trucks ever since.

In 1936, Dodge&#x27;s light, car-based trucks were crucially redesigned—not only receiving a new &quot;Fore-Point&quot; (similar to Cab Forward) design of the front side and cab—but especially, the old car frames were dropped and for the first time replaced by modern, truck-style chassis, with side rails &quot;welded&quot; to the cross members. These welded frames were from here on introduced on half-ton to one-ton rated trucks, expanding Dodge into a heavier truck market segment than before.

In 1939 again, Dodge presented a completely redesigned line of pickups and trucks, with streamlined new, &#x27;art-deco&#x27; front sheet metal styling. Introducing the concept of &quot;Job-Rated&quot;, Dodge tried to offer customers the truck that fit every job they were buying it for. From the 1939 &#x27;Job-Rated&#x27; trucks onwards, Dodge&#x27;s light and medium trucks were built in its &#x27;Mound Road&quot; plant in Warren, Michigan.

Following World War II and the successful application of four-wheel drive to the truck line, Dodge introduced a civilian version that it called the Power Wagon. At first, based almost exactly on the military-type design, variants of the standard truck line were eventually given 4WD and the same &quot;Power Wagon&quot; name.

Dodge was among the first to introduce car-like features to its trucks, adding the plush Adventurer package during the 1960s and offering sedan-like space in its Club Cab bodies of the 1970s. Declining sales and increased competition during the 1970s eventually forced the company to drop its medium- and heavy-duty models, an arena the company has only recently begun to reenter.

Dodge introduced what they called the &quot;Adult Toys&quot; line to boost its truck sales in the late 1970s, starting with the limited edition Lil&#x27; Red Express pickup (featuring, a 360 c.i. police interceptor engine and visible big rig-style exhaust stacks). Later came the more widely available Warlock. Other &quot;Adult Toys&quot; from Dodge included the &quot;Macho Power Wagon&quot; and &quot;Street Van&quot;.

As part of a general decline in the commercial vehicle field during the 1970s, Dodge eliminated their LCF Series heavy-duty trucks in 1975, along with the Bighorn and medium-duty D-Series trucks, and affiliated S Series school buses were dropped in 1978. On the other hand, Dodge produced several thousand pickups for the United States Military under the CUCV program from the late 1970s into the early 1980s.

Continuing financial problems meant that even Dodge&#x27;s light-duty models – renamed as the Ram Pickup line for 1981 – were carried over with the most minimal of updates until 1993. Two things helped to revitalize Dodge&#x27;s fortunes during this time. One was the introduction of Cummins&#x27; powerful and reliable B Series turbo-diesel engine as an option for 1989. This innovation raised Dodge&#x27;s profile among consumers who needed power for towing or large loads. The second was a class-exclusive V8 engine option for the mid-sized Dakota pickup.

Dodge introduced the Ram&#x27;s all-new &quot;big-rig&quot; styling treatment for 1994. Besides its instantly polarizing looks, exposure was also gained by usage of the new truck on the hit TV show &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; starring Chuck Norris. The new Ram also featured a new interior with a console box big enough to hold a laptop computer, and ventilation and radio controls that were designed to be easily used even with gloves on. A V10 engine derived from that used in the Viper sports car was also new, and the previously offered Cummins turbodiesel remained available. The smaller Dakota was redesigned for 1997 using the &quot;big-rig&quot; styling, thus giving Dodge trucks a definitive &quot;face&quot; that set them apart from the competition.

The Ram was redesigned again for 2002, and the Dakota in 2005, and was an evolution of the original, but adding the Hemi V8 engine to the list of available options, due to the revival of the legendary Chrysler Hemi V8 engine. New medium-duty chassis-cab models were introduced for 2007 with standard Cummins turbodiesel power as a way of gradually getting Dodge back into the business truck market again.

For a time during the 1980s, Dodge imported a line of small pickups from Mitsubishi, known as the D50, or later the Ram 50 and were carried on as a stopgap until the Dakota&#x27;s sales eventually made the imported trucks irrelevant. Reversing the role, Mitsubishi has more recently purchased Dakota pickups from Dodge and restyled them into their own Raider line for sale in North America.

===Vans===
Dodge built panel delivery models for many years since its founding, but their first purpose-built van model arrived for the 1964 model year with the compact A Series. Based on the Dodge Dart platform and using its proven six-cylinder or V8 engines, the A-series was a strong competitor for both its domestic rivals (from Ford and Chevrolet/GMC) and the diminutive Volkswagen Transporter line.

As the market evolved, Dodge realized that a bigger and stronger van line would be needed in the future. The B Series was introduced for 1971 offering both car-like comfort in its Sportsman passenger line or expansive room for gear and materials in its Tradesman cargo line. A chassis cab version was also offered for use with bigger cargo boxes or flatbeds. Like the trucks, Chrysler&#x27;s dire financial straits of the late 1970s precluded any major updates for the vans for many years. Rebadged as the Ram Van and Ram Wagon for 1981, this old design carried on for 33 years with little more than cosmetic and safety updates until 2003.
The DaimlerChrysler merger of 1998 made it possible for Dodge to explore new ideas; hence the European-styled Mercedes-Benz Sprinter line of vans was brought over and given a Dodge styling treatment. Redesigned for 2006 as a 2007 model, the economical diesel-powered Sprinters have become very popular for city usage among delivery companies like FedEx and UPS in recent years. Because of their fuel efficiency major motorhome manufacturer Thor Motor Coach made several Class C and Class A Motorhomes available on the Dodge Sprinter Chassis including their Four Winds Siesta &amp; Chateau Citation product lines.

Dodge also offered a cargo version of its best-selling Caravan for many years, at first calling it the Mini Ram Van, which was a name originally applied to the short-wheelbase B Series Ram Vans, and later naming it the Caravan C/V, the C/V stood for Cargo Van. For model year 2012, the Caravan C/V was rebranded as a Ram and was renamed the Ram C/V.

The Grand Caravan became Dodge&#x27;s last minivan, as it was discontinued after the 2020 model year to introduce the Chrysler Voyager for the 2021 model year.

===Sport utility vehicles===
Dodge&#x27;s first experiments with anything like a sport utility vehicle appeared in the late 1950s with a windowed version of their standard panel truck – known as the Town Wagon. These were built in the same style through the mid-1960s.

But the division never entered the SUV arena in seriousness until 1974, with the purpose-built Ramcharger. Offering the then-popular open body style and Dodge&#x27;s powerful V8 engines, the Ramcharger was a strong competitor for trucks like the Ford Bronco, Chevrolet Blazer and International Scout II.

Dodge was left with outdated products during the 1980s as the market evolved. The Ramcharger hung on through 1993 with only minor updates. When the Ram truck was redesigned for the 1994 model year, the Ramcharger was discontinued in the American and Canadian markets. A version using the updated styling was made for the Mexican Market but was never imported to the U.S. or Canada.

Using the mid-sized Dakota pickup&#x27;s chassis as a base, Dodge introduced the 1997 four-door Durango SUV with seating for eight people and was sized between smaller SUVs (like the Chevrolet Blazer and Ford Explorer) and larger models (like the Chevrolet Tahoe and Ford Expedition). The redesigned version for 2004 grew a little in every dimension, becoming a full-size SUV, but was still sized between most of its competitors. For 2011 a new unibody Durango based on the Jeep Grand Cherokee was released. The 2011 Durango shrank slightly to a size comparable to the original model. With the Journey being discontinued in 2020, the Durango became the only SUV offering in the Dodge lineup.

Dodge also imported a version of Mitsubishi&#x27;s popular Montero (Pajero in Japan) as the Raider from 1987 until 1989.

=== High-performance vehicles ===
From the early 2000s, Dodge&#x27;s highest-performing vehicles were marketed under Street &amp; Racing Technology (SRT) branding. These models often came equipped with high-performance V8s. These models included the Dodge Challenger SRT (2008–current), Dodge Charger SRT (2006–current), Dodge Magnum SRT (2006–2008) and Dodge Durango SRT (2018-current-). They also produced the Dodge Neon SRT-4 (2003–2005), Dodge Caliber SRT-4 (2008–2009), Dodge Viper (1991–2010; 2012–2017), and Dodge Ram SRT-10 (2004–2006). In 2015, FCA introduced the Hellcat, a 707 HP, supercharged 6.2 L Hemi V8. In 2017, Dodge released the Dodge Challenger SRT Demon. It is powered by an 840 HP supercharged 6.2 L Hemi V8, and comes from the factory with a toolbox known as the &quot;Demon Toolbox&quot; that has everything a buyer will need to drag race, including the skinny front drag tires. However, buyers will only get 840 HP on race fuel. On regular pump gas, it produces 808 HP, a 101 HP increase over the Hellcat.

==International markets==
===Argentina===
Dodge came to Argentina in the early 20th century with imported cars and trucks. In 1960, it partnered with Fevre-Basset as a local manufacturer. The first vehicle made in Argentina was the D-100 &quot;Sweptline&quot; pickup. Between 1961 and 1980, a variety of trucks were produced, including the D-400/DP-400, D-500/DP-500, DP600, DD900 and DD1000 (the last two with one curiosity: the air-cooled Deutz engine rather Perkins or Chrysler). Passenger cars were also produced, namely the Valiant I and II, and the local versions of the 1966 Dodge Dart (called Valiant III and IV). In 1971, the Dodge 1500, a rebadged Hillman Avenger from the United Kingdom was introduced. In 1982, production of Dodge vehicles ceased when German company Volkswagen bought the Fevre factory.

In Argentina, the name &quot;Polara&quot; was used to refer to a series of vehicles developed based on the fourth-generation North American Dodge Dart. These cars were manufactured between 1968 and 1980, by the subsidiary Chrysler-Fevre Argentina S.A.

In 1993, Dodge began marketing cars and pick-ups directly in Argentina. Currently, both the Journey and the Ram are available to Argentine customers.

===Asia===
Dodge entered the Japanese market in mid-2007 and re-entered the Chinese market in late 2007. Soueast Motors of China assembled the Caravan for the Chinese market. Dodge marketed its vehicles in South Korea in 2004, starting with the Dakota. Dodge vehicles are no longer marketed in China, Japan, and South Korea. In the Philippines, Dodge vehicles have been distributed by Auto Nation Group (formerly known as CATS Motors) since the 2000s. Dodge vehicles are also distributed in some Middle Eastern countries.

===Australia===
Vehicles were produced in Australia under the Dodge name by Chrysler Australia from the 1950s through to the 1970s.

Dodge re-entered the Australian market in 2006 with the Caliber, their first offering since the AT4/D5N trucks in 1979 and the first Dodge passenger car to be marketed in Australia since the Phoenix sedan was discontinued in 1973. The second model to be introduced was the Nitro, with the Avenger and Journey followed. Dodge chose not to use the full model lines and engines available to them, the 2.7 L V6 being available in the Journey and Avenger instead of the 3.2 L in the North American versions. However, diesel engines were introduced in all their cars.
Following the Global Financial Crisis, Chrysler introduced the facelifted model of the Caliber and discontinued the Avenger imports. From early 2012 on, model year 2010 cars were available. By early 2012 no new cars were imported into Australia aside from the facelifted 2012 Journey.

There were rumors that Dodge cars would be re-badged as Fiats in the Australian market as was the case in Europe. The Dodge nameplate continued due to consistent sales of the Journey. However, the brand was discontinued in the Australian market after 2016.

The Dodge Kingsway was also assembled in India, by Premier Automobiles Limited, until the late 1950s.
===Brazil===
In Brazil, Dodge cars were produced between 1969 and 1981 with the models Dart, Charger, Magnum, LeBaron (all powered by the same 318 cid V8 engine), and the compact 1800/Polara, based on the British Hillman Avenger. The manufacturer was acquired by Volkswagen in 1981. In 1998, the Dakota pickup started production in a new plant in Campo Largo, Paraná by Mercedes-Benz, which belongs to its former partner Daimler AG. It was built there until 2001 with petrol and diesel engines and regular, extended, and crew cabs. In 2010, Dodge started sales of the imported pickup Ram 2500. The model portfolio is being expanded, starting with the Journey crossover for the 2009 model year. The marque ended the sales of its last product, the Journey in 2019, remaining only to serve the existing customers.

===Canada===
In Canada, the Dodge lineup of cars started down the road to elimination along with the Plymouth line when in 1988 the Dodge Dynasty was sold in Canada as the Chrysler Dynasty and sold at both Plymouth and Dodge dealers. Similarly, the new Dodge Intrepid, the Dynasty&#x27;s replacement, was sold as the Chrysler Intrepid.

For 2000, the new Neon became the Chrysler Neon. The Chrysler Cirrus and Mitsubishi-built Dodge Avenger were dropped. Dodge trucks, which have been sold at Canadian Plymouth dealers since 1973, continued without change. All Plymouth-Chrysler and Dodge-Chrysler dealers became Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep dealers.

The diluting of the Chrysler name did not go well in Canada, especially as the nameplate had been pushed as a luxury line since the 1930s. For 2003, the revamped Neon appeared in Canada as the Dodge SX 2.0. Since then, all new Dodge models have been sold in Canada under the Dodge name.

===Europe===
Dodge started assembling lorries (trucks) in the United Kingdom from imported parts in 1922. In 1933 it began to manufacture a British chassis at its works in Kew, using American engines and gearboxes.

;Right-hand drive Dodge trucks
During the Second World War, Dodge Kew was part of the London Aircraft Production Group, building fuselage sections for Handley Page Halifax bombers. The pre-war and wartime truck range was replaced by the Dodge 100 &quot;Kew&quot; truck (1949–1957), nicknamed the &quot;parrot nose&quot; due to the sculpted lines of its bonnet. Subsequent normal-control Dodges built at Kew were the 200 series (1957–1963) and the 400 series (1963–1965). The 400 series was a version of the American D series medium-duty models. Also built at Kew were the cab-over 300 series (1957–1965) and its successor the 500 series/K-series (1964–1978) tilt-cab. In 1964 Chrysler acquired its first stake in the British Rootes Group and it was decided to consolidate all truck production at Rootes&#x27; factory in Dunstable. British assembly of the 400 series was discontinued due to declining sales of normal-control trucks, and production of the 500 series was transferred to Dunstable in 1967.

In some export markets, British-built Dodge trucks used the Fargo or DeSoto marques, and the situation was further complicated after the takeover of the Rootes Group whose commercial vehicles were sold under the Commer and Karrier marques. Some Dodge 500s were given Commer badges, whilst the 100 series &quot;Commando&quot; light truck (1970–1989) developed by Rootes was initially marketed under all five marques. In the UK market, Commers were usually lighter than Dodges, whereas the Karrier marque tended to be used on vehicles sold to public sector operators such as local authorities. Some of the smaller Commer/Karrier vans were also sold as Fargos in export markets. In 1976 Chrysler Europe rationalized its marques and thereafter all the British-built commercial vehicles were sold as Dodges or (increasingly rarely) Karriers. This included the smaller Commer SpaceVan (1960–1983) and Commer Walk-Thru (1961–1979), which became Dodges for their final years. The van and pick-up versions of Chrysler Europe&#x27;s French-built Simca 1100 were also branded as Dodges in Britain from 1976, although they remained Simcas elsewhere (and became Talbots in Britain after 1979).

American Chrysler Corporation cars, including some Dodge models, were assembled from CKD kits at various locations in Europe until the 1970s, including Kew (1920s-30s), Antwerp (1926–1958), and Rotterdam (1958–1970), but sales volumes were low as even &#x27;compact&#x27; American cars like the Dodge Dart were enormous gas-guzzlers by European standards. However, protectionist policies in some countries encouraged small local manufacturers to license-build CKD models, including AMAG in Switzerland (building Chryslers and Dodges 1948–1972) and Barreiros in Spain (building Dodge Darts from 1965 as the Barreiros Dart). By 1969 Chrysler had acquired full control of Barreiros, and Darts were being exported to other European countries under the Dodge name (precipitating the closure of the Rotterdam plant). From 1970 the Spanish-built Dart was replaced by the Barreiros/Dodge 3700 which remained in production until 1977. The Dodge cars were a relatively small part of the Madrid factory&#x27;s output, which was dominated by smaller Simca-designed cars and Barreiros-designed heavy-duty trucks. From 1972 such trucks were sold as the Dodge 300 (though unrelated to the earlier British 300 series), which was available as 4×2, 6×4, 8×2, and 8×4 rigids, as well as 4×2 semi-trailer tractors.

Following Chrysler Europe&#x27;s collapse in 1977 and the sale of their assets to Peugeot, the van and truck range and the associated factories in Dunstable and Madrid were quickly passed on to Renault Véhicules Industriels. Chrysler licensed the Dodge name to be used on Renault trucks sold in certain European markets – most notably the United Kingdom. However, the only subsequent new model to carry the Dodge name was the Dodge 50 series (1979–1992), which replaced the earlier Walk-Thru and was widely used in Britain by utility companies, the military, and as a minibus, but was rarely seen outside the UK. Thereafter all-new models were Renaults, and in 1987 the Dodge name was dropped from the remaining inherited models (50 and Commando), which became Renaults for their last few years of production.

Dodge vehicles would not return to Europe until the introduction of the Neon, badged as a Chrysler, in the mid-1990s.

Chrysler reintroduced the Dodge marque to Europe on a broad scale in 2006, with a lineup consisting of North American-built Caliber, Avenger, Viper SRT-10, Nitro, and Dodge Journey cars and SUVs, but this proved to be a short-lived return due to the onset of the Great Recession and the takeover of Chrysler by Fiat. In 2010 the Dodge marque was pulled from the UK due to poor sales and on June 1, 2011, it was dropped from the rest of Europe. All of the Dodge models were discontinued in Europe except the Dodge Journey, which became the Fiat Freemont (and which was not available in the right-hand-drive Ireland or UK markets). The Dodge marque was reintroduced to many European markets in 2019.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, the Hyundai Accent, Hyundai Atos, and Hyundai H100 were branded as &quot;Dodge&quot;, Dodge Attitude, &quot;Verna by Dodge&quot;, &quot;Atos by Dodge&quot; and &quot;Dodge H100&quot; respectively, and sold at Chrysler/Dodge dealers in the 2000s and early 2010s. Dodge and Hyundai ended the venture and Dodge began to sell rebadged and reworked Fiats and Mitsubishi.

== Logo evolution ==
* Star: The original Dodge was a circle, with two Greek deltas intertwined representing the letter &quot;D&quot;, forming a six-pointed star in the middle; an interlocked &quot;DB&quot; was at the center of the star, and the words &quot;Dodge Brothers Motor Vehicles&quot; encircled the outside edge. Although similar to the Star of David, the Dodge brothers were not Jewish; they were Methodists. Although the &quot;Brothers&quot; was dropped from the name for trucks in 1929 and cars in 1930, the DB star remained in the cars until the 1939 models were introduced.
* Ram: For 1932 Dodge cars adopted a leaping ram as the car&#x27;s hood ornament. Starting with the 1940 models the leaping ram became more streamlined and by 1951 only the head, complete with curving horns, remained. The 1954 model cars were the last to use the ram&#x27;s head before the reintroduction in the 1980s. Dodge trucks adopted the ram as the hood ornament for the 1940 model year with the 1950 models as the last.
* Crest: For 1941 Dodge introduced a crest, supposedly the Dodge family crest. The design had four horizontal bars broken in the middle by one vertical bar with an &quot;O&quot; in the center. A knight&#x27;s head appeared at the top of the emblem. Although the head would be dropped for 1955, the emblem would survive through 1957 and reappear on the 1976 Aspen. The crest would be used through 1981 on its second time around, being replaced by the Pentastar for 1982. The knight&#x27;s head without the crest would be used for 1959.
* Forward Look: Virgil Exner&#x27;s radical Forward Look redesign of Chrysler&#x27;s vehicles for the 1955 model year was emphasized by the adoption of a logo by the same name, applied to all Chrysler Corporation vehicles. The Forward Look logo consisted of two overlapped boomerang shapes, suggesting space age rocket-propelled motion. This logo was incorporated into Dodge advertising, decorative trim, ignition and door key heads, as well as on accessories through September 1962.
* Fratzog: Dodge&#x27;s logo from September 1962 through 1981 was a fractured deltoid composed of three arrowhead shapes forming a three-pointed star. The logo first appeared on the 1962 Polara 500 and the mid-year 1962 Custom 880. One of its designers came up with the meaningless name Fratzog for the logo, which ultimately stuck. In 2021, Dodge announced that it will revive the Frotzog logo as a secondary emblem used exclusively to denote electric vehicles.
* Pentastar: From 1982 until 1995, Dodge used Chrysler&#x27;s Pentastar logo on its cars and trucks to replace the Dodge crest, although it had been used for corporate recognition since late 1962. In advertisements and on dealer signage, Dodge&#x27;s Pentastar was red, while Chrysler-Plymouth&#x27;s was blue.
* Ram&#x27;s head: Dodge reintroduced the ram&#x27;s head hood ornament on the new 1973 Dodge Bighorn heavy-duty tractor units. Gradually the ram&#x27;s head began appearing on the pickup trucks as Dodge began to refer to their trucks as Ram. The present iteration of the Ram&#x27;s-head logo appeared in late 1992 on the 1993 Intrepid, standardizing that logo in 1996 for all vehicles except the Viper, which uses the Viper&#x27;s Head.
* Racing stripes: In 2010, with the separation of the Ram brand, Dodge introduced a new logo, initially used solely for marketing purposes, consisting of a Dodge wordmark with two diagonal racing stripes. The company stated that the emblem was meant to honor the brand&#x27;s heritage of sports cars.
* Return to the Fratzog: In 2025, Dodge began using the Fratzog logo, beginning exclusively for the next-gen Dodge Charger.

<text>A future history, imaginary history or anticipatory history is a fictional conjecture of the future used by authors of science fiction and other speculative fiction to construct a common background for stories. Sometimes the author publishes a timeline of events in the history, while other times the reader can reconstruct the order of the stories from information provided. The term can also be used to describe the subgenre of science fiction that uses this framework.

A set of stories which share a backdrop but are not really concerned with the sequence of history in their universe are rarely considered future histories. For example, Lois McMaster Bujold&#x27;s Vorkosigan Saga is not generally considered a future history. Standalone stories which trace an arc of history are rarely considered future histories.

Future histories differ from alternate history, in which different outcomes are ascribed to past events, because they consist of imagined events in the writer&#x27;s future.

== History ==
&quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; calls &quot;The Ruins; Or, a Survey of the Revolutions of Empires&quot;, by Constantin François de Chassebœuf, comte de Volney (published in 1791) probably the first recognizable future history. In it, the narrator is transported into space and sees the Earth as a whole while its history unfolds, which Volney uses to present his political and theological ideas. It lists similar examples from the 19th and 20th centuries by William Delisle Hay, Alfred Döblin (&quot;Berge Meere und Giganten&quot;, 1924 ), André Maurois, and Olaf Stapledon (&quot;Last and First Men&quot;, 1930, and &quot;Star Maker&quot;, 1937). Some of these purported to be excerpts of a history book from the future, having no personal protagonists but rather describing the development of nations and societies over decades and centuries. Other related classic works include:

* Adam Mickiewicz&#x27;s lost &quot;&quot; from the first half of the 19th century
* Jack London&#x27;s &quot;The Unparalleled Invasion&quot; (1914) describing a devastating war between an alliance of Western nations and China in 1975, ending with a complete genocide of the Chinese people. It is described in a short footnote as &quot;Excerpt from Walt Mervin&#x27;s &#x27;Certain Essays in History&#x27;.
* André Maurois&#x27;s &quot;The War against the Moon&quot; (1928), where a band of well-meaning conspirators intend to avert a devastating world war by uniting humanity in hatred of a fictitious Lunar enemy, only to find that the moon is truly inhabited and that they had unwittingly set off the first interplanetary war. This, too, is explicitly described as an excerpt from a future history book.
* H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot; (1933) contains numerous footnotes and references to the works of (mostly fictitious) prominent historians of the 20th and 21st centuries.

===In science fiction===
The first science fiction writer to create a future history may have been Neil R. Jones in his stories of the 1930s. The term appears to have been coined by John W. Campbell, Jr., the editor of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, in the February 1941 issue of the magazine, to describe Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Future History&quot;; the issue included a timeline of the stories. However, a fan had used the term, with &quot;history&quot; in quotation marks, in a letter to the pulp &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot; the previous year.

== Other future histories ==
* Poul Anderson&#x27;s two future histories: The Psychotechnic League and his later Technic History (see Nicholas van Rijn, Dominic Flandry)
* Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot;, &quot;Galactic Empire&quot; and &quot;Robot&quot; series
* Iain M. Banks&#x27; Culture series
* Stephen Baxter&#x27;s two future histories: &quot;Xeelee Sequence&quot;, 1991–2018, and his &quot;Evolution&quot; short story collection
* James Blish&#x27;s &quot;Cities in Flight&quot;
* C. J. Cherryh&#x27;s Alliance-Union series
* Larry Niven&#x27;s &quot;Known Space&quot;
* H. Beam Piper&#x27;s Terro-Human Future History
* Alastair Reynolds&#x27; Revelation Space universe
* Clifford D. Simak&#x27;s &quot;City&quot; stories
* Cordwainer Smith&#x27;s &quot;Instrumentality of Mankind&quot; stories

==Future becoming past==
The future projected in a &quot;future history&quot; can often turn out to be wildly inaccurate.

For example, in 1933 H. G. Wells postulated in &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot; a Second World War in which Nazi Germany and Poland are evenly matched militarily, fighting an indecisive war over ten years; and Poul Anderson&#x27;s early 1950s Psychotechnic League depicted a world undergoing a devastating nuclear war in 1958, yet by the early 21st century managing not only to rebuild the ruins on Earth but also engage in extensive space colonization of the Moon and several planets. A writer possessing knowledge of the actual swift collapse of Poland in World War II and the enormous actual costs of far less ambitious space programs in a far less devastated world would have been unlikely to postulate such outcomes. &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; was set in the future and featured developments in space travel and habitation which have not occurred on the timescale postulated.

A problem with future history science fiction is that it will date and be overtaken by real historical events, for instance H. Beam Piper&#x27;s future history, which included a nuclear war in 1973, and much of the future history of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Jerry Pournelle&#x27;s &quot;CoDominium&quot; future history assumed that the Cold War would end with the United States and Soviet Union establishing a co-rule of the world, the CoDominium of the title, which would last into the 22nd Century—rather than the Soviet Union collapsing in 1991.

There are several ways this is dealt with. One solution to the problem is when some authors set their stories in an indefinite future, often in a society where the current calendar has been disrupted due to a societal collapse or undergone some form of distortion due to the impact of technology. Related to the first, some stories are set in the very remote future and only deal with the author&#x27;s contemporary history in a sketchy fashion, if at all (e.g. the original &quot;Foundation&quot; Trilogy by Asimov). Another related case is where stories are set in the near future, but with an explicitly allohistorical past, as in Ken MacLeod&#x27;s &quot;Engines of Light&quot; series.

In other cases, the merging of the fictional history and the known history is done through extensive use of retroactive continuity. In yet other cases, such as the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television series and the fiction based on it, much use is made of secret history, in which the events that take place are largely secret and not known to the general public.

As with Heinlein, some authors simply write a detailed future history and accept the fact that events will overtake it, making the sequence into a &quot;de facto&quot; alternate history.

Lastly, some writers formally transform their future histories into alternate history, once they had been overtaken by events. For example, Poul Anderson started The Psychotechnic League history in the early 1950s, assuming a nuclear war in 1958—then a future date. When it was republished in the 1980s, a new foreword was added explaining how that history&#x27;s timeline diverged from ours and led to war.

<doc id="42971" wikidata="Q1304408" url="?curid=42971" title="The Dukes of Hazzard">
<text>The Dukes of Hazzard is an American action comedy television series created by Gy Waldron that aired on CBS from January 26, 1979, to February 8, 1985, with a total of seven seasons consisting of 147 episodes. It was consistently among the top-rated television series in the late 1970s and early 1980s (at one point, ranking second only to &quot;Dallas&quot;, which immediately followed the show on CBS&#x27;s Friday night schedule).

The show is about two young male cousins, Bo and Luke Duke, who live in rural Georgia and are on probation for moonshine-running. Probation prevents the &quot;Duke Boys&quot; from owning guns, and they are armed with bows and arrows and clever plans to outwit a corrupt sheriff and greedy rich &quot;city slickers.&quot; Their cousin Daisy Duke and other family (such as patriarch Uncle Jesse) live in a secluded country home in the woods, where they plan various escapades to expose and evade county commissioner Boss Hogg and law officer Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane. The &quot;Duke Boys&quot; drive a customized 1969 Dodge Charger nicknamed &quot;the General Lee&quot;, which became a symbol of the show.

The series was inspired by the 1975 film &quot;Moonrunners&quot;, about a bootlegger family, which Waldron wrote and directed and had many identical or similar character names and concepts.

The show was the basis for a film of the same title in 2005.

==Plot==
&quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; follows the adventures of &quot;the Duke boys&quot;, primarily cousins Bo Duke (John Schneider) and Luke Duke (Tom Wopat) (but alternatively Coy and Vance Duke for most of season 5), who live on a family farm in fictional Hazzard County, Georgia (the exact location of which is never specified, though Atlanta is mentioned several times as the nearest big city), with their cousin Daisy (Catherine Bach) and their wise old Uncle Jesse (Denver Pyle). The Duke boys race around in their customized 1969 Dodge Charger stock car, dubbed &quot;(The) General Lee&quot;, evading crooked and corrupt county commissioner Boss Hogg (Sorrell Booke) and his bumbling and corrupt Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (James Best) along with his deputy(s), and always managing to get caught in the middle of various local escapades and incidents.

Bo and Luke were previously sentenced to probation for illegal transportation of moonshine; their Uncle Jesse made a plea bargain with the U.S. government to refrain from distilling moonshine in exchange for Bo and Luke&#x27;s freedom. As a result, Bo and Luke are on probation and not allowed to carry instead, they often use compound bows, sometimes with arrows tipped with or to leave Hazzard County unless they get permission from their probation officer, Boss Hogg. The details of their probation terms vary from episode to episode. Sometimes it is implied that they would be jailed for merely crossing the county line, or in other episodes the state line. On other occasions it is shown that they may leave Hazzard as long as they are back within a certain time. Several other technicalities of their probation come into play at various times.

Corrupt county commissioner Jefferson Davis (J. D.) &quot;Boss&quot; Hogg either runs or has his fingers in virtually everything in Hazzard County. Hogg is forever angry at the Dukes, especially Bo and Luke, for their habit of foiling his crooked schemes. Many episodes revolve around Hogg&#x27;s attempts to engage in some such scheme, sometimes with the aid of hired criminal help.

Some of these are get-rich-quick schemes, but many others affect the financial security of the Duke farm, which Hogg has long wanted to acquire for various reasons. Other times, Hogg hires criminals from out of town to do his dirty work for him, and he often tries to frame Bo and Luke as part of these plots. Bo and Luke always seem to stumble over Hogg&#x27;s latest scheme, sometimes by curiosity, and often by sheer luck, and quash it. Despite the Dukes often coming to his rescue, Hogg never loses his irrational dislike of the clan, particularly Bo and Luke, often accusing them of spying on him, robbing or planning to rob him, or other nefarious actions.

Hogg was played by Sorrell Booke, who performed frequently on radio, stage, and film before his role in &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;. Hogg is one of only two characters to appear in every episode of the series, the other being Uncle Jesse Duke. Daisy Duke appears in all but one episode (season 3&#x27;s &quot;To Catch a Duke&quot;).

The show&#x27;s other main characters include local mechanic Cooter Davenport (Ben Jones), who in early episodes was portrayed as a wild, unshaven rebel, often breaking or treading on the edge of the law, before settling down to become the Duke family&#x27;s best friend (often called an &quot;honorary Duke&quot;) and owning the local garage. Enos Strate (Sonny Shroyer) is an honest but naive young deputy who, despite his friendship with the Dukes (and his crush on Daisy), is reluctantly forced to take part in Hogg and Rosco&#x27;s crooked schemes. In the third and fourth seasons, when Shroyer left for his own show, his character was replaced by Deputy Cletus Hogg (Rick Hurst), Boss&#x27;s cousin, who is slightly wilier than Enos but still a somewhat reluctant player in Hogg&#x27;s plots.

Owing to their fundamentally good natures, the Dukes often wind up helping Boss Hogg out of trouble, albeit grudgingly. More than once Hogg is targeted by former associates who are either seeking revenge or have double-crossed him after a scheme has unraveled. Sheriff Coltrane also finds himself targeted in some instances. On such occasions, Bo and Luke usually have to rescue their adversaries as an inevitable precursor to defeating the bad guys; in other instances, the Dukes join forces with Hogg and Coltrane to tackle bigger threats to Hazzard or one of their respective parties. These instances became more frequent as the show progressed, and later seasons saw a number of stories where the Dukes and Hogg (and Coltrane) temporarily work together.

==Production==

The series was developed from the 1975 film &quot;Moonrunners&quot;. Created by Gy Waldron in collaboration with ex-moonshiner Jerry Rushing, this movie shares many identical and very similar names and concepts with the subsequent TV series. Although itself essentially a comedy, this original movie was much cruder and edgier than the family-friendly TV series that evolved from it.

In 1977, Waldron was approached by Warner Bros. with the idea of developing &quot;Moonrunners&quot; into a television series. Waldron reworked various elements from &quot;Moonrunners&quot;, ultimately devising what became &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;. Production began in October 1978 with the original intention of only nine episodes for a mid-season filler. The first five episodes were filmed in Covington and Conyers, Georgia and surrounding areas, including some location work in nearby Atlanta. After completing production on the fifth episode, &quot;High Octane&quot;, the cast and crew broke for Christmas break, expecting to return in several weeks to complete the ordered run of episodes. In the meantime, executives at Warner Bros. were impressed by the rough preview cuts of the completed episodes and saw potential in developing the show into a full-running series. Part of this plan was to move production from Georgia to the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, California, to simplify production as well as develop a larger workshop to service the large number of automobiles needed for the series.

Rushing appeared as shady used car dealer Ace Parker in the third episode, &quot;Repo Men&quot; (the fourth to be broadcast). Rushing believed this to be the start of a recurring role, in return for which he would supply creative ideas from his experiences: many of the &quot;Dukes&quot; (and thus &quot;Moonrunners&quot;) characters and situations were derived from Rushing&#x27;s experiences as a youth, and much of the character of Bo Duke, he states to be based on him. However, &quot;Repo Men&quot; turned out to be the character&#x27;s only appearance in the show&#x27;s run, leading to a legal dispute in the following years over the rights to characters and concepts. Despite this, Rushing remained on good terms with cast and crew and in recent years has made appearances at several fan conventions.

By the end of the first (half) season, the family-friendly tone of &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; was mostly in place. When the show returned for a second season in the fall of 1979 (its first full season), with a few further minor tweaks, it quickly found its footing as a family-friendly comedy-adventure series. By the third season, starting in the fall of 1980, the template which would be widely associated with the show was evident.

As well as car chases, jumps and stunts, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; relied on character familiarity, with each character effectively serving the same role within a typical episode. Deputy Cletus replaced Deputy Enos in Seasons 3 and 4, and Coy and Vance Duke temporarily replaced Bo and Luke (due to a salary dispute) for most of Season 5, but these were the only major cast changes through the show&#x27;s run. Only Uncle Jesse and Boss Hogg appeared in all 145 episodes; Daisy appears in all but one, the third season&#x27;s &quot;To Catch a Duke.&quot; The General Lee also appears in all episodes except &quot;Mary Kaye&#x27;s Baby&quot;.

The show was largely filmed in Hidden Valley in Thousand Oaks, California, with scenes also shot at nearby Lake Sherwood and at Paramount Ranch in nearby Agoura Hills.

==Episodes==

The show ran for seven seasons and a total of 147 episodes. Many of the episodes followed a similar structure &quot;out-of-town crooks pull a robbery or commit a crime or scandal, Duke boys blamed, spend the rest of the hour clearing their names, the General Lee flies and the squad cars crash&quot;.

==Cast and characters==

===Main characters===
* Lucas K. &quot;Luke&quot; Duke (Tom Wopat), is the dark-haired, older Duke boy. He is typically the one who thinks of the plan that will get himself and his cousin Bo out of whatever trouble they have gotten into. Luke wears a checked blue shirt (a plain blue shirt in most, though not all, second-series episodes) and a denim jacket over it in first season and a few later second-season episodes. He is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps and a former boxer. Luke acted hypocritically on occasion, most prominently in season 1 episode 6 &quot;Swamp Molly&quot;. Luke was the first Duke to perform the &quot;hood slide&quot; across the &quot;General Lee&quot;, which is seen in the opening credits of the show (a shot taken from the second episode, &quot;Daisy&#x27;s Song&quot;). According to Wopat the slide was an accident, because his foot got caught on the side of the &quot;General Lee&quot; when he attempted to jump across the hood; he also caught his arm on the hood&#x27;s radio antenna, resulting in such antennas being removed from later versions of the &quot;General Lee&quot;. However, the &quot;hood slide&quot; quickly proved popular and became a regular staple of the rest of the episodes. The only episode to directly refer to the age difference between Luke and Bo is in the seventh season opener, the &quot;flashback&quot; episode &quot;Happy Birthday, General Lee&quot;, where it is stated that Luke had already been in the Marines while Bo was in his last year at high school. Though Bo and Luke share the CB call sign &quot;Lost Sheep&quot;, in the season one episode &quot;Money to Burn&quot;, Luke refers to himself (singularly) as &quot;Sittin&#x27; Duck&quot;.
* Beauregard &quot;Bo&quot; Duke (John Schneider) is the blond-haired, younger Duke boy. He is more of the &quot;shoot first, ask questions later&quot; type than Luke. In the first-season episode &quot;High Octane&quot;, his actual first name is revealed to be Beauregard. Bo had his eye, or heart, distracted by a pretty girl at times, leading the Dukes into trouble in a few episodes. Bo usually wears a cream-yellow shirt; for the first two seasons he wears a blue T-shirt underneath (brown in the first episode). This was slowly phased out during the third season. An ex-stock car driver, Bo is the one who drives the &quot;General Lee&quot; most of the time, with Luke riding shotgun. Bo was also the first Duke to jump the General Lee. He and Luke take turns of driving the &quot;General Lee&quot; in some episodes as they share the car with each other (very early episodes suggest that it belongs solely to him; Luke is said to have a car that Cooter had wrecked shortly prior to the start of the opening episode, &quot;One Armed Bandits&quot;). Bo is known for his rebel yell, &quot;Yeeeee-haaa,&quot; which he usually yells when the &quot;General Lee&quot; is airborne during a jump. Bo was the only Duke to perform a roof slide (sliding over the roof of the car rather than just the hood), as seen in the season 4 episodes &quot;Dear Diary&quot; and &quot;Share and Share Alike&quot;. The Duke boys share the CB call sign or handle &quot;Lost Sheep&quot;.
* Daisy Duke (Catherine Bach) is Bo, Luke, Coy, and Vance&#x27;s cousin. She is beautiful, honest, and kind, although she can be slightly over-trusting and naïve, which has led the Duke family into trouble on a number of occasions. She sometimes aspires to be a songwriter and singer, and at other times, a reporter. She races around Hazzard with her cousins, first in a yellow and black 1974 Plymouth Road Runner (later a 1971 Plymouth Satellite was used) and then, from mid-season 2 on, in her trademark white 1980 Jeep CJ-7, christened &quot;Dixie&quot; with a golden eagle emblem on the hood (and the name &quot;Dixie&quot; on the hood sides). Daisy works as a waitress at the Boar&#x27;s Nest, the local bar and pub owned by Boss Hogg, as part of an agreement with Boss Hogg so that he would give Uncle Jesse and the boys a loan for a lower interest rate so the boys could purchase the entry fee for a race in which they wished to race the &quot;General Lee&quot;. The arrangement was supposed to be for an indefinite time, but there are several times throughout the series when Hogg fires her. However, he always ends up rehiring her at the end of each episode because of various circumstances. Although Hogg is a nemesis to Daisy and her family, she is friends with Hogg&#x27;s wife Lulu. Daisy often uses her charming personality and sex appeal to influence male policemen or henchmen into going easier on other Duke family members and/or cause them to become too distracted to carry out their assigned duties or evil plans. Daisy also utilizes her position at the restaurant to get insider information to help the Dukes in foiling Hogg&#x27;s various schemes. She also has the distinction of having her trademark provocatively high-cut jean short shorts named after her: &quot;daisy dukes&quot;. Her CB handle is &quot;Bo Peep&quot;. Occasionally, the variant of &quot;Country Cousin&quot; is used.
* Jesse Duke (Denver Pyle), referred to by just about everyone in Hazzard other than Boss Hogg as &quot;Uncle Jesse&quot;, is the patriarch of the Duke clan, and the father figure to all of the Dukes who stay with him on the Duke farm. Jesse apparently has at least five siblings but no children of his own, and he happily provides for his nephews and niece in the unexplained absence of all of their parents (Gy Waldron, the creator of the show, states on the DVDs that their parents were killed in a car wreck, but it was never mentioned in the show). In the third broadcast episode, &quot;Mary Kaye&#x27;s Baby&quot;, Jesse says that he has delivered many babies, including Bo and Luke. Jesse Duke, in his youth, had been a ridgerunner in direct competition with Boss Hogg, whom he always calls &quot;J.D.&quot;. However, while both Boss Hogg and Uncle Jesse would scowl at the mention of the other&#x27;s name, the two enjoyed a lifelong &quot;friendship&quot; of sorts, with one helping the other when in desperate need. Jesse educated his nephews against Hogg, and often provides the cousins with inspirational sage advice. Uncle Jesse drives a white 1973 Ford F-100 pickup truck. In the barn, he also has his old moonshine-running car, called &quot;Sweet Tillie&quot; in its first appearance (in the first-season episode &quot;High Octane&quot;), but referred to as &quot;Black Tillie&quot; in subsequent appearances. In the second-season episode &quot;Follow That Still&quot; and the sixth-season episode &quot;The Boar&#x27;s Nest Bears&quot;, the marriage to, and death of, his wife is mentioned; he also mentions marrying her in the first-season episode &quot;Luke&#x27;s Love Story&quot;. His CB handle is &quot;Shepherd&quot;, a reference to his always seeking out and saving his &quot;lost sheep&quot;—Bo and Luke—from their various mishaps.
* Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (James Best) is the bumbling and corrupt sheriff of Hazzard County and right-hand man and brother-in-law of its corrupt county administrator, Jefferson Davis &quot;J.D.&quot; Hogg (&quot;Boss Hogg&quot;), whom Rosco calls his &quot;little fat buddy&quot;, &quot;Little Chrome Dome&quot;, &quot;Little Meadow-Muffin&quot;, and several other names. In the early episodes, it is mentioned that Rosco spent the first 20 years of his career as a mostly honest lawman, but after the county voted away his pension, Rosco joined Hogg in an effort to fund his retirement in his last couple of years as sheriff. Early episodes also portray him as a fairly hard-nosed, somewhat darker policeman character, who even shoots a criminal during the first season. As the series progressed and producers recognized how popular it had become with children, Best altered his portrayal into a more bumbling, comical character. By the end of the first season, his origin had been virtually forgotten (and his job as sheriff appeared to become open-ended). Rosco is also the younger brother of Lulu Coltrane Hogg (Boss Hogg&#x27;s wife). Rosco frequently initiates car chases with Bo and Luke Duke, but the Duke boys usually elude Rosco by outwitting him, with Rosco typically wrecking his patrol car as a result from which he would nearly always escape unscathed (only two episodes—the fourth season&#x27;s &quot;Coltrane vs. Duke&quot; and the sixth season&#x27;s &quot;Too Many Roscos&quot;—toy with the concept of him being injured. The first episode has him faking injury so that the Duke boys would lose the General Lee while the latter has Best playing two characters. His normal character, Rosco, is presumed drowned while a criminal that looks like Rosco has a headache). These chases are often the result of Rosco setting up illegal speed traps such as false or changing speed limit signs and various other trickery, which became increasingly cartoonish and far-fetched as the seasons passed. While he enjoys &quot;hot pursuit&quot; he seemingly (Boss Hogg as well) never intends for anyone to get seriously hurt. His middle initial, &quot;P&quot;, was added at the start of the second season, and only one episode (the third season&#x27;s &quot;Mrs. Rosco P. Coltrane&quot;, in which he is subjected to a scam marriage) reveals his middle name, &quot;Purvis&quot;. Rosco also has a soft spot for his Basset Hound Flash, introduced at the start of the third season. His radio codename is &quot;Red Dog&quot;. When Best briefly boycotted the show during the mid-second season, he was temporarily replaced by several &quot;one-off&quot; sheriffs, the longest standing being Sheriff Grady Bird, played by Dick Sargent, who appeared in two episodes (&quot;Jude Emery&quot; and &quot;Officer Daisy Duke&quot;).
* Boss Jefferson Davis &quot;J.D.&quot; Hogg (Sorrell Booke) is the wealthiest man in Hazzard County and owns most of its property and businesses—whether directly or by holding the mortgages over the land. Usually dressed in an all-white suit, he is the fat, greedy, corrupt county commissioner with visions of grandeur and a voracious appetite for food, who constantly orders Rosco to &quot;Get them Duke boys!&quot; He is also Bo and Luke&#x27;s probation officer; when Bo and Luke need to leave Hazzard they always get permission from him. Boss Hogg is also married to (and dominated by) Rosco&#x27;s &quot;fat sister&quot; (Lulu Coltrane Hogg), a point that does not always sit well with either Boss Hogg or Rosco; Hogg sometimes claims that Rosco is indebted to him because of it, though his on-screen interactions with Lulu typically show him loving her deeply (and giving in to her stronger personality). In addition to his role as county commissioner, he is also the police commissioner, land commissioner, and bank president. Boss is also the chief of the Hazzard Fire Department and the owner of, or primary mortgage holder on, most of the places in the county, including the Boar&#x27;s Nest, Rhubottem&#x27;s Store, Cooter&#x27;s garage and the Duke farm. It is implied in some episodes that he is the Justice of the Peace, but in others Hazzard relies on a circuit judge. In the episode &quot;Coltrane vs. Duke&quot;, Hogg represents Rosco when he sues the Dukes, implying that he is a licensed attorney. His vehicle is a white 1970 Cadillac Coupe de Ville convertible, with bull horns mounted on the hood. In the first few seasons, he is almost always driven around by a chauffeur. His old moonshine-running car was called &quot;The Gray Ghost&quot;. Every morning, Boss Hogg would drink coffee and eat raw liver (Booke, a method actor, actually ate the raw liver). Boss Hogg is described in one analysis as &quot;an ineffectual bad guy—hence amusing&quot;.
* Cooter Davenport (Ben Jones) is the Hazzard County mechanic, nicknamed &quot;Crazy Cooter&quot; (a &quot;cooter&quot; is a large freshwater turtle, common in the southeastern U.S.). In the early episodes, he is a wild man, often breaking the law. By the end of the first season, he has settled down and become an easygoing good ol&#x27; boy. Although not mentioned in the first couple of episodes, by the mid-first season, he owns &quot;Cooter&#x27;s Garage&quot; in Hazzard County Square, directly across from the Sheriff&#x27;s Department. Cooter is an &quot;honorary Duke&quot;, as he shares the same values and often assists the Dukes in escaping Rosco&#x27;s clutches, or helps them to foil Boss Hogg&#x27;s schemes. During the second season, Jones left the series for a few episodes due to a dispute over whether the character should be clean-shaven or have a full beard. In his absence, Cooter&#x27;s place was filled by several of Cooter&#x27;s supposed cousins who were never mentioned before or since. Jones returned when the dispute was solved—Cooter would be clean-shaven (although, for continuity reasons, with the episodes being broadcast in a different order to that which they were filmed, he was not clean-shaven until the third season onwards). Cooter drives a variety of trucks, including Fords, Chevys, and GMCs. His CB handle is &quot;Crazy Cooter&quot; and he often starts his CB transmissions with &quot;Breaker one, Breaker one, I might be crazy but I ain&#x27;t dumb, Craaaazy Cooter comin&#x27; atcha, come on.&quot;
* Deputy Enos Strate (Sonny Shroyer) is a friend of the Dukes but, while working for Rosco and Boss, he is often forced into pursuing the Dukes and/or arresting them on trumped-up charges. In the early episodes, Enos is shown to be a rather good driver (and respected as such by Bo and Luke) but, by the end of the first season, he is shown to be as incompetent a driver as Rosco. His common catchphrase is &quot;Possum on a gumbush!&quot; When he returns from his stint in Los Angeles, he seems to be able to stand up to Boss and Rosco slightly more, and sometimes refuses to participate in their schemes. In the early episodes, Rosco frequently calls him &quot;jackass&quot;, which soon evolved into the more family-friendly &quot;dipstick&quot; as the show became a hit with younger viewers (though Boss Hogg, who also used the term &quot;jackass&quot; to berate Sheriff Rosco, occasionally returned to calling Enos this in later seasons). Enos has a crush on Daisy Duke that she often uses to the Dukes&#x27; advantage in unraveling Hogg and Rosco&#x27;s schemes. Enos is very much in love with Daisy, and although Daisy seems to love him back, it is supposedly only as a close friend. In the penultimate episode, &quot;Enos and Daisy&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, the two plan on getting married, only to have Enos call it off at the last minute due to an attack of hives, brought on by the excitement of possibly being married to Daisy. Later, in the first reunion movie, Enos and Daisy become a pair again and plan to get married, but this time &quot;Daisy&quot; backs out at the last minute upon the unexpected sight of her ex-husband.
* Deputy Cletus Hogg (Rick Hurst), Boss Hogg&#x27;s second cousin twice removed, is generally friendly and dim-witted. Like Enos, Cletus is often forced by Rosco and Hogg to chase the Dukes on trumped up charges. While Cletus is good-hearted, and sometimes resentful of having to treat the Dukes in such a way, he is somewhat more willing to go along with Hogg and Rosco than Enos. Cletus has a crush (though not as bad as Enos&#x27; crush) on Daisy and is even convinced she wants to marry him. Like Enos and Rosco, Cletus frequently ends up landing in a pond when pursuing the Duke boys in a car chase. Cletus makes his first appearance as the driver of a bank truck, part of Hogg&#x27;s latest get-rich-quick scheme, in the first-season episode &quot;Money To Burn&quot;, and becomes temporary deputy while Enos is away in the second-season episodes &quot;The Meeting&quot; and &quot;Road Pirates&quot;. Leaving a job at the local junkyard, he becomes permanent deputy in the third season&#x27;s &quot;Enos Strate to the Top&quot;. After Enos&#x27; return, the pair both serve as deputies and share the same patrol car until the end of season five. Each of the Hazzard County Sheriff&#x27;s Department officers drives various mid- to late-1970s Chrysler mid-size B body patrol cars, most often a Dodge Monaco or Plymouth Fury.
* Coy Duke (Byron Cherry) is another blond-haired cousin who moves to Uncle Jesse&#x27;s farm along with his cousin Vance after Bo and Luke left Hazzard to join the NASCAR circuit in season 5. Like his cousin Bo, he often drives the &quot;General Lee&quot;, is a bit wilder than Vance and chases women; he and Vance are only in the first 19 episodes of season 5 and Coy and Vance are in only one episode with their cousins Bo and Luke when they return from the NASCAR circuit. Supposedly, with cousin Vance, Coy had previously lived on the Duke farm until 1976, before the series had started.
* Vance Duke (Christopher Mayer), an obvious replacement for Luke, filled the void of a dark-haired Duke on the show. Like Luke, Vance is more the thinker and the planner of the duo, along with being more mature than Coy. He is also a former Merchant Mariner.
* The Balladeer (voice of Waylon Jennings) sings and plays the &quot;Dukes of Hazzard&quot; theme song, &quot;Good Ol&#x27; Boys&quot;, and serves as the show&#x27;s narrator. During each episode, he provides an omniscient viewpoint of the situations presented, and regularly interjects comical asides during crucial plot points (often, during a freeze frame of a cliffhanger scene right before a commercial break) and &quot;down home&quot; aphorisms (these freeze-frame cliffhangers were often abridged in showings in some countries, such as the commercial-free BBC in the United Kingdom). After numerous requests from fans to see the Balladeer on-screen, Jennings finally appeared in one episode, the seventh season&#x27;s aptly titled &quot;Welcome, Waylon Jennings&quot;, in which he was presented as an old friend of the Dukes.
* Flash (Sandy and others) is a slow-paced basset hound and Rosco&#x27;s loyal companion, who hates Boss Hogg but loves the Dukes. She first appeared in the first official third-season episode &quot;Enos Strate to the Top&quot; (the two-part third season opener &quot;Carnival of Thrills&quot; was held over from the previous season), although the dog was not formally &quot;introduced&quot; in that episode. Initially referred to as a boy, Flash is later regularly a girl (despite an occasional male reference afterwards). Flash was added at the start of the third season, after James Best suggested to the producers that Rosco have a dog. Rosco doted on Flash, often calling her &quot;Velvet Ears&quot;. Flash was portrayed by several Basset Hounds during the series (distinguishable by different facial colors), the most regular being Sandy. James Best bought a share of Sandy, who was rescued from an animal shelter and was trained by Alvin Mears of Alvin Animal Rentals. Sandy lived to age 14. A stuffed dog named Flush was used for dangerous stunt work in a few episodes.

The pilot episode was to include a barber modeled after Floyd Lawson on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; as a regular character, but was eliminated when the final draft of the pilot&#x27;s script was written and before the show was cast.

====Others====
NASCAR driver Terry Labonte makes a brief, uncredited appearance as a crewman in the episode &quot;Undercover Dukes Part 1&quot;. The race cars supplied for both &quot;Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot; of &quot;Undercover Dukes&quot; were supplied by Labonte&#x27;s racing team owner, Billy Hagan. However, the emblems of the sponsors of the cars (at that time Labonte was sponsored by Budweiser) were covered to avoid paying royalties.

====The celebrity speed trap====
During the show&#x27;s second season, the show&#x27;s writers began incorporating a &quot;celebrity speed trap&quot; into some of the episodes, as a means to feature top country stars of the day performing their hits. On its first couple of instances, the &quot;speed trap&quot; was featured early in the story, but for most of the cases, it was featured in the last few minutes of an episode, often used when the main story was running too short to fill episode time.

The &quot;celebrity speed trap&quot; feature was essentially the same each time: Aware that a big-name country star was passing through the area, Boss Hogg would order Rosco to lower the speed limit on a particular road to an unreasonable level (using a reversible sign, with one speed limit on one side and another, far lower, on the back), so that the targeted singer would be in violation of the posted limit. The singer would be required to give a free performance at the Boar&#x27;s Nest in exchange for having their citations forgiven; the performer would then perform one of their best-known hits or other popular country music standard, while the Dukes, Boss, Rosco, Enos, Cletus, Cooter, and other patrons whooped and hollered in enjoyment of the performance. More often than not, the performer would give a sarcastic parting shot to Boss and Rosco.

Singers who were featured in the &quot;speed trap&quot; segments were:

* Hoyt Axton
* Donna Fargo
* Freddy Fender
* Doug Kershaw (on the original soundtrack)
* The Oak Ridge Boys (twice)
* Roy Orbison
* Buck Owens
* Johnny Paycheck (lip-syncing an original recording)
* Mel Tillis
* Dottie West
* Tammy Wynette
* Waylon Jennings (the show&#x27;s narrator)

Honorable mentions: Mickey Gilley, Loretta Lynn

Gilley&#x27;s and Lynn&#x27;s appearances were not solely for the celebrity speed trap. After performing a concert in Hazzard, Gilley was nabbed while leaving and forced to do a second show to nullify his citation. Loretta Lynn was kidnapped by criminals wanting to break into the music business. Lynn was the very first country music guest star on the show in 1979 and had an entire episode dedicated to her, titled &quot;Find Loretta Lynn&quot;.

Janie Fricke was the only country music guest star who did not perform a song, celebrity speed trap or otherwise. She played an accomplice to a robber who hid money in the dashboard of the car that was to become the &quot;General Lee&quot;.

==Casting of Coy and Vance==

&quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; was consistently among the top-rated television series (at one point, ranking second only to &quot;Dallas&quot;, which immediately followed the show on CBS&#x27; Friday night schedule). With that success came huge profits in merchandising, with a wide array of &quot;Dukes of Hazzard&quot; toys and products being licensed and becoming big sellers. However, over the course of the show&#x27;s fourth season, series stars Tom Wopat and John Schneider—who had already previously voiced their concern and discontent about increasingly inferior scripts being written for episodes—became increasingly concerned about a contract dispute over their salaries and merchandising royalties owed to them from the high sales of &quot;Dukes&quot; products. They felt that neither of them was being paid what was owed to them and this became very frustrating to the duo. As a result, in the spring of 1982, as filming was due to begin on the fifth season, Wopat and Schneider did not report to the set in protest over the matter. Catherine Bach also considered walking out due to similar concerns, but Wopat and Schneider convinced her to stay, insisting that if she left, there might not be a show to come back to, and that settling the issue was up to them.

Production was pushed back by a few weeks as fairly similar looking replacements were hastily hired: Byron Cherry as Coy Duke and Christopher Mayer as Vance Duke. Bo and Luke were said to have gone to race on the NASCAR circuit; how they did this considering the terms of their probation was never explained. Cherry and Mayer were originally contracted at just 10 episodes as stand-ins, still with hope that a settlement might be reached with Wopat and Schneider (in total, they made 19 episodes including one with Bo and Luke). Some scripts for Coy and Vance were originally written for Bo and Luke but with their names crossed out and Coy and Vance penned in.

The new Dukes—previously unmentioned nephews of Uncle Jesse, who were said to have left the farm in 1976 before the show had started—were unpopular with the great majority of viewers, and the ratings immediately sank. Much of the criticism was that Coy and Vance were nothing but direct clones of Bo and Luke, with Coy a direct &quot;carbon copy&quot; replacement for Bo and Vance for Luke, with little variation in character. This was something that even show creator Gy Waldron has said was wrong, and that he insisted, unsuccessfully, that audiences would not accept direct clones and the two replacements should be taken in a different direction character wise, but was overruled by the producers. Waldron also commented that if Bach too had walked, the show would probably have been canceled. It was reported that prior to filming, Cherry and Mayer were given Bo and Luke episodes to watch, to study and learn to emulate them, although Cherry has said in interviews that he does not recall this ever happening.

Hit hard by the significant drop in ratings, Warner Bros. renegotiated with Wopat and Schneider, and eventually a settlement was reached, and the original Duke boys returned to the series in early 1983, four episodes from the conclusion of the fifth season. Initially, part of the press release announcing Wopat and Schneider&#x27;s return suggested that Cherry and Mayer would remain as part of the cast (though presumably in a reduced role), but it was quickly realized that &quot;four Duke boys&quot; would not work within the context of the series, and due to the huge unpopularity associated with their time on the show, they were quickly written out of the same episode in which Bo and Luke returned.

===Return of Bo and Luke===
Although Coy and Vance were never popular, viewers were disappointed by their departure episode, &quot;Welcome Back, Bo &#x27;n&#x27; Luke&quot;, which was for the most part a standard episode, with the return of Bo and Luke and the departure of Coy and Vance tacked onto the beginning (Bo and Luke return from their NASCAR tour just as Coy and Vance leave Hazzard to tend to a sick relative). More than a few viewers commented that they were disappointed by this, and that they would have liked to see both pairs of Duke boys team up to tackle a particularly dastardly plot by Boss Hogg before Coy and Vance&#x27;s departure, but as it turned out, Coy and Vance had little dialogue and were gone by the first commercial break, never to be seen, heard from or even mentioned again.

While the return of Bo and Luke was welcomed by ardent and casual viewers alike, and as a result ratings recovered slightly, the show never completely regained its former popularity. One of Wopat and Schneider&#x27;s disputes even before they left was what they considered to be increasingly weak and formulaic scripts and episode plots. With Wopat and Schneider&#x27;s return, the producers agreed to try a wider scope of storylines. It continued for two more seasons. Many cast members, including Wopat, decried the miniature car effects newly incorporated to depict increasingly absurd &quot;General Lee&quot; and patrol car stunts (which had previously been performed with real cars by stunt drivers). The miniature car effects were intended as a budget saving measure (to save the cost of repairing or replacing damaged vehicles) and to help compete visually with KITT from the NBC series &quot;Knight Rider&quot;. By February 1985, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; ended its run after seven seasons.

==Vehicles==
The show is estimated to have gone through 250–355 cars during filming.

===The &quot;General Lee&quot; (Dodge Charger)===


The &quot;General Lee&quot; was based on a 1969 Dodge Charger owned by Bo and Luke. It was orange with a Confederate battle flag painted on the roof, the words &quot;GENERAL LEE&quot; over each door, and the number &quot;01&quot; on each door. In the original five Georgia-filmed episodes, a Confederate flag along with a checkered racing flag in a criss-cross pattern could be seen behind the rear window; this was removed because the extra decal was impossible to replicate over and over again. The name refers to the American Civil War Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The television show was based on the movie &quot;Moonrunners&quot;, in turn based on actual moonshine runners who used a 1958 Chrysler named &quot;Traveler&quot;, after General Lee&#x27;s horse (with a slight spelling change). &quot;Traveler&quot; was originally intended to be the name of the Duke boys&#x27; stock car too, until producers agreed that &quot;General Lee&quot; had more punch to it.

Since it was built as a race car, the doors were welded shut. Through the history of the show, an estimated 309 Chargers were used; 17 are still known to exist in various states of repair. A replica was owned by John Schneider, known as &quot;Bo&#x27;s General Lee&quot;. In 2008, Schneider sold &quot;Bo&#x27;s General Lee&quot; at the Barrett-Jackson automobile auction for $230,000. An eBay auction which garnered a bid of $9,900,500 for the car was never finalized, with the purported bidder claiming his account had been hacked. The underside of the hood has the signatures of the cast from the 1997 TV movie. Schneider has also restored over 20 other &quot;General Lee&quot;s to date. In 2008, a replica of the &quot;General Lee&quot; fetched a high bid of $450,000 at the Barrett-Jackson auto auction. In 2012, the &quot;General Lee 1&quot;, the first car used in filming the series, was purchased at auction by golfer Bubba Watson for $110,000. The car had been scrapped after being wrecked during the famous opening jump shoot, and was later discovered in a junkyard by the president of the North American General Lee fan club. In 2015, following a wave of sentiment against Confederate symbolism in the wake of shootings in Charleston, SC (relating to photos where the attacker had posed with the Confederate flag), Bubba Watson announced that he would remove the Confederate flag from the roof of the &quot;General Lee 1&quot; and repaint it with the U.S. national flag.

The show also used 1968 Chargers (which shared the same sheet metal) by pop-riveting the &quot;I&quot; piece to the center of the 68&#x27;s grille, as well as cutting out the tail lights, pop-riveting the &#x27;69 lenses in place, and removing the round side marker lights. These Chargers performed many record-breaking jumps throughout the show, almost all of them resulting in a completely destroyed car. No 1970 Chargers were used, as backdating them proved to be too time-consuming.

The Duke boys added a custom air horn to the &quot;General Lee&quot; that played the first 12 notes of the song &quot;Dixie&quot;. The Dixie horn was not originally planned, until a Georgia local hot rod racer drove by and sounded his car&#x27;s Dixie horn. The producers immediately rushed after him asking where he had bought the horn. Warner Bros. purchased several Chargers for stunts, as they generally destroyed at least one or two cars per episode. By the end of the show&#x27;s sixth season, the Chargers were becoming harder to find and more expensive. In addition, the television series &quot;Knight Rider&quot; began to rival the &quot;General Lee&quot;″s stunts. As such, the producers used 1:8 scale miniatures, filmed by Jack Sessums&#x27; crew, or recycled stock jump footage—the latter being a practice that had been in place to an extent since the second season, and had increased as the seasons passed.

Some of the 01 and Confederate flag motifs were initially hand painted, but as production sped up, these were replaced with vinyl decals for quick application (and removal), as needed.

During the first five episodes of the show that were filmed in Georgia, the cars involved with filming were given to the crew at the H&amp;H body shop near the filming location. At this shop, the men worked day and night to prepare the wrecked cars for the next day while still running their body shop during the day. Time was of the essence, and the men that worked at this shop worked hard hours to get the cars prepared for the show.

The third episode &quot;Mary Kaye&#x27;s Baby&quot; is the only one in which the &quot;General Lee&quot; does not appear. Instead, the Dukes drove around in a blue 1975 Plymouth Fury borrowed from Cooter that Luke later destroyed by shooting a flaming arrow at the car, whose trunk had been leaking due to the moonshine stowed in the back.

The Duke boys&#x27; CB handle was (jointly) &quot;Lost Sheep&quot;. Originally when the show was conceived, their handle was to be &quot;General Lee&quot; to match their vehicle, but this was only ever used on-screen on one occasion, in the second episode, &quot;Daisy&#x27;s Song&quot;, when Cooter calls Bo and Luke over the CB by this handle, although they were actually driving Daisy&#x27;s Plymouth Road Runner (see below) at the time. As it became obvious that the &quot;General Lee&quot; handle would be out of place when the Duke boys were in another vehicle, the &quot;Lost Sheep&quot; handle was devised (with Uncle Jesse being &quot;Shepherd&quot; and Daisy being &quot;Bo Peep&quot;).

===Hazzard police cars (AMC Matador, Dodge Polara, Dodge Monaco, Plymouth Fury)===
The 1975 AMC Matador was one of many Hazzard County police cars used on the series, mostly in the first season; they had light bars and working radios. A 1970 Dodge Polara and a 1974 Dodge Monaco were used during the pilot episode &quot;One Armed Bandits&quot;; these were also seen in the show&#x27;s title sequence. From the second season, the 1977 Dodge Monaco was mostly used. From mid-season four the similar looking 1978 Plymouth Fury was used instead. The Matadors and Furies were former Los Angeles Police Department vehicles, while the Monacos were former California Highway Patrol units.

===Plymouth Road Runner===
A 1974 Plymouth Road Runner (yellow with a black stripe) was Daisy Duke&#x27;s car in the first five episodes of the first season. For the last episodes of the first season a similarly painted 1971 Plymouth Satellite Sebring with a matching &quot;Road Runner&quot; stripe was used. In the second season Bo and Luke send it off a cliff in &quot;The Runaway&quot;. Another identical Plymouth 1971 model car appeared in a few more episodes after &quot;The Runaway&quot; due to the episodes being aired out of production order.

===Jeep CJ-7===
&quot;Dixie&quot; was the name given to Daisy Duke&#x27;s white 1980 Jeep CJ-7 &quot;Golden Eagle&quot; which had a golden eagle emblem on the hood and the name &quot;Dixie&quot; on the sides. Like other vehicles in the show, there was more than one Jeep used throughout the series, which were both manual and automatic transmission. The design of the roll cage also varied across the seasons. When the Jeep was introduced at the end of the second season&#x27;s &quot;The Runaway&quot;, it was seen to have doors and a slightly different paint job, but, bar one appearance in the next produced episode, &quot;Arrest Jesse Duke&quot; (actually broadcast before &quot;The Runaway&quot;, causing a continuity error), thereafter the doors were removed and the paint job was made all-white, with &quot;Dixie&quot; painted on the sides of the hood. These Jeeps were leased to the producers of the show by American Motors Corporation in exchange for a brief mention in the closing credits of the show.

===Ford F-100 pickup truck===
Uncle Jesse&#x27;s truck was a white Ford pickup truck, most commonly a sixth-generation (1973–1977) F100 Styleside. However, in the earliest episodes it had a Flareside bed, and varied between F100 and F250 models throughout the show&#x27;s run. Bo, Luke and Daisy also drove Jesse&#x27;s truck on occasion.

===Cadillac de Ville===
A white 1970 Cadillac de Ville convertible was used as Boss Hogg&#x27;s car, notably with large bull horns as a hood ornament. In early seasons, Hogg was almost always driven by a chauffeur, who was normally nameless and had little or no dialogue, but identified on occasion as being called &quot;Alex&quot;; and played by several uncredited actors, including stuntman Gary Baxley. This chauffeur was often dressed in a red plaid shirt and deep brown or black Stetson hat but was on occasion an older man, sometimes dressed in more typical chauffeur attire.

Hogg is first seen to drive for himself in the second-season opener &quot;Days of Shine and Roses&quot;, where he and Jesse challenge each other to one last moonshine race. From the fourth season onward, except for a couple of brief reappearances of the chauffeur (during the fourth season), Hogg drove himself around in his Cadillac (or occasionally driven by Rosco and, in the series&#x27; finale, by Uncle Jesse) and frequently challenged others by invoking his driving expertise from his days as a ridge-runner. Unlike other vehicles in the series, Boss Hogg&#x27;s Cadillac is typically treated with kid gloves. The car is almost always seen with its convertible top down, with the top only being seen in two episodes, &quot;Daisy&#x27;s Song&quot; (the chauffeur was called &quot;Eddie&quot; in this episode), the second to be produced and broadcast, and briefly in the second-season episode &quot;Witness for the Persecution&quot;, when Cooter is returning it to the Court House after repairs. When filming close-up shots inside the studio, a similar-looking 1967 De Ville is used. The door vent windows (eliminated for 1969), as well as the small, round, chrome exterior mirror being noticeably different from the 1970 model&#x27;s large, square, brushed stainless mirror.

===Ford Custom 500===
A green and blacked out 1971 Ford Custom 500 sedan named &quot;Black Tillie&quot; was once used by Uncle Jesse to make moonshine runs. This car was used in &quot;Days of Shine and Roses&quot; (season 2 episode 1). It was not used to make moonshine runs but for a race between Jesse Duke and Boss Hogg, where because of the agreement with the federal government they carried 10 gallons of water to replace the moonshine.

==Theme song==
The theme song &quot;Good Ol&#x27; Boys&quot; was written and performed by Waylon Jennings. He was also &quot;The Balladeer&quot; (as credited), and served as narrator of the show. The version released as a single is not the same version used in the show&#x27;s opening credits; the single version has a repeat of the chorus and an instrumental to pad out the length, uses a different instrumental mix that emphasizes the bass, and replaces the last verse with an inside joke about how the TV show producers &quot;keep on showing [Jennings&#x27;s] hands and not [his] face on TV&quot;.

In 1980, the song reached No. 1 on the American Country chart and peaked at No. 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Broadcast history==
===United States===
* The series was originally broadcast in America by CBS on Friday nights, at 9:00 p.m. and later 8:00 p.m., preceding &quot;Dallas&quot; from January 26, 1979, to February 8, 1985.
* Until TNN (The Nashville Network) was purchased by Viacom, it aired reruns of &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;. Some months after the creation of &quot;The National Network&quot; (shortly before its change to &quot;Spike TV&quot;), the program was absent from much of television for quite some time. Viacom&#x27;s country music-themed cable network CMT (the former sister network to TNN) aired the show from 2005 to 2007 at 8:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time every weekday. CMT began airing the series in late February 2005. It also aired Monday–Thursday on ABC Family.
*CMT aired &quot;The Dukes Ride Again&quot;, a special marathon which featured episodes from the first two seasons, on the weekend of September 10, 2010, and have begun airing episodes weeknights at 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. Eastern Time starting September 13, 2010.
* CMT began to re-air &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; reruns in high definition, on January 5, 2014.
* TV Land began to air &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; reruns on June 10, 2015, but removed them just three weeks later as a response to the Charleston church shooting and the ensuing debate over the modern display of the Confederate flag.

====Syndication and cable====
Soon before the series ended its original run on CBS, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; went into off-network syndication. Although not as widely run as it was back in the 1980s and the years since, reruns of the program do continue to air in various parts of the United States.

Notably, television stations that aired the show in syndication include KCOP Los Angeles, WGN-TV Chicago, KBHK-TV San Francisco, WKBD Detroit, WTAF/WTXF Philadelphia, KTXL Sacramento, WVTV Milwaukee, KMSP Minneapolis–Saint Paul, WLOS Asheville, among others.

The Nashville Network bought &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; from Warner Bros. in 1997 for well over $10 million; not only did it improve the network&#x27;s ratings, the show was also popular among younger viewers, a demographic TNN had a notorious difficulty in drawing.

Nationwide, the show also aired on ABC Family (2000–01, 2004), TNN&#x27;s sister network CMT (2005–07, 2010–12, 2014–15) and TV Land (2015); TV Land dropped the show in the wake of protests and controversy surrounding the display of the Confederate flag.

====Nielsen ratings====
===International===
* In the United Kingdom, the series aired on BBC One, debuting on Saturday March 3, 1979 at 9:00 p.m. (just several months after it began in the U.S.). Popular with all ages (and as some of the more adult elements of very early episodes faded out of the series), it quickly moved from its post-watershed position to a more family-friendly Monday evening slot at 7:20 p.m. Soon a massive hit, it moved from Monday evenings to prime-time Saturday evening (times varied, but typically around 5:25 p.m.), where it stayed for a number of years. Later when ratings began to dip (partly caused by the change to Coy and Vance, and partly to do with competition from ITV, with new hit shows such as &quot;The A-Team&quot;), it moved back to Mondays, making the odd return for short runs on Saturdays. Late episodes also popped up occasionally on Sunday afternoons, and the remaining episodes of the final season were broadcast on weekday mornings during school holidays in the late 1980s. In 1992, Sky1 bought a package of the program, owning the rights to the first 60 episodes produced (running up to &quot;The Fugitive&quot;), showing the series on Saturday afternoons at 4 p.m. They later showed the episodes they owned again, including a stint showing it in a weekday 3 p.m. slot, running for 50 minutes (including commercials) with the episodes heavily edited for time as a result, often leaving gaps in the plot. Despite requests from fans, they did not secure the rights to later episodes. The series was later run on the satellite channels Granada Plus and TNT. U.K. satellite channel Bravo began airing reruns in August 2005. Reruns are currently shown on Forces TV.
* In Brazil, the series was named &quot;Os Gatões&quot; (&quot;The Big Hunks&quot;), which limited its popularity among the male audience.
* The series was also shown in the Netherlands by Dutch broadcasting organization AVRO, with Dutch subtitles, rather than being dubbed.
* It was shown on Ten Network in Australia from September 1979 until the end of the series, and repeated throughout the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. It was quietly rerun on pay TV channel TV1 in the 2000s, but is now shown on Nine Network&#x27;s subchannel, Go!.
* The series aired weekdays on New Zealand&#x27;s channel The BOX. Previously it aired on TVNZ for its original run, being repeated on Saturday afternoons in the early 1990s. In May 1984, a doctor and member of the Auckland Health Board called for the programme to be taken off-air for promoting reckless driving; the production of the story for the &quot;Network News&quot; was featured in the 1985 documentary &quot;Network New Zealand&quot;.
* The series was popular in Colombia, dubbed into Spanish. Some late-night reruns continue to the present day.
* In Italy, the series started to air in September 1981 on Canale 5, under the title &quot;Hazzard&quot; and quickly became popular with the viewers.

==Spin-offs==
* A spin-off named &quot;Enos&quot;, starring Sonny Shroyer, aired on CBS from November 1980 to May 1981 and lasted a total of 18 episodes before being canceled.
* An animated version of the series called &quot;The Dukes&quot; aired in 1983 and was produced by Hanna-Barbera. The first season fell under the Coy and Vance era of the live-action show and thus they were adapted into animated form. By the second season, Bo and Luke had returned, and they replaced Coy and Vance in the cartoon series.
* Several video games based on the series were created:
** &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; for ColecoVision (1984) and ZX Spectrum (1985); also planned for the Atari 2600
** &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard: Racing for Home&quot; (1999)
** &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard II: Daisy Dukes It Out&quot; (2000)
** &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard: Return of the General Lee&quot; (2004)
* In 2005, the Humana Festival of New American Plays premiered a full-length comedy drama entitled &quot;Hazzard County&quot; by Allison Moore. The story centers on a young widowed mother and a visit that she receives from a big city television producer. Interspersed with recollections of Bo, Luke, and Daisy, the play takes a deep look at Southern &quot;good ol&#x27; boy&quot; culture and its popularization through the lens of American mass media.
* In 2014, AutoTrader made a commercial where Bo and Luke shop for a new car while being chased.

==TV movies==
Two made-for-TV reunion movies aired on CBS, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard: Reunion!&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard: Hazzard in Hollywood&quot; (2000).

==Films==
The film &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; was released in 2005, and a direct-to-video prequel &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning&quot; in 2007. These films were more buddy comedy road film in tone than the original TV series, which was an action-comedy.

==Home media==

===DVD===
Warner Home Video has released all seven seasons of &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; on DVD in Regions 1 and 2. The two TV movies that followed the series were released on DVD in Region 1 on June 10, 2008, and in Region 4 on June 4, 2014. In Region 4, Warner has released only the first six seasons on DVD and the two TV movies. &quot;The Complete Series and Two Unrated Feature Films Box Set&quot; was released on DVD in Region 1 on November 14, 2017.

Two one-shot DVDs were also released by Warner, the first one containing three episodes from the TV series (one from each one of its first three seasons) and the second one containing the first episode from it and a behind-the-scenes featurette that announced the upcoming premiere of the 2005 film.

===Streaming===
The TV series was also made available for streaming and download through a variety of services.

==Reception==

Season 1 garnered a mixed reception from critics. Tom Shales (&quot;The Washington Post&quot;): &quot;Within five minutes, the program is out of breath from pandering so pantingly to its audience. [...] If this show succeeds, every television critic in America may as well quit.&quot; Peter Hartlaub, writing for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;: &quot;Unfortunately, the first &quot;Dukes&quot; season wasn&#x27;t the best, with a low budget and characters who found their footing as the series continued (Cooter started out a numbskull type).&quot; Conversely, Danny Graydon (&quot;Empire&quot;) writes: &quot;Today, &quot;Hazzard&quot;″s considerable charm endures, even if the sheer predictability is wearing.&quot;

==Legacy and influence in popular culture==
In 2005, Tom Wopat and John Schneider were reunited during &quot;Exposed&quot;, a fifth-season episode of the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;. Wopat guest-starred as Kansas State Senator Jack Jennings, an old friend of Clark Kent&#x27;s adoptive father Jonathan Kent (portrayed by Schneider). In the episode, Jennings drives a 1968 Dodge Charger—the same body style as the &quot;General Lee&quot;.

Daisy Duke was almost always dressed in very short blue jeans shorts. That style of shorts became known as &quot;Daisy Dukes&quot;. Katy Perry references &quot;Daisy Dukes&quot; in her number one single “California Gurls”. The popularity grew first in the 1993 with the song &quot;Daisey Dukes&quot; by rap group Duice and the 69 Boys. 

The series is referenced in the British sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;; it is one of Grandad&#x27;s favourite television programmes.

&quot;Lizard Lick Towing&quot; featured an episode with its repossession specialists Ronnie Shirley and Bobby Brantley repossessing a &quot;General Lee&quot; replica.

After the 2015 Charleston church shooting, renewed debate about the symbolism of the Confederate battle flag (which was prominently featured on the &quot;General Lee&quot;″s roof, and the panel behind the rear window in the first five episodes) prompted TV Land to pull reruns of the original series. Warner Bros., which owns the property, announced it would also no longer create merchandise bearing the flag, including miniatures of the &quot;General Lee&quot;. During the 2020 George Floyd protests, Amazon reportedly considered removing the program from its streaming service.
===Tourist attraction===
Artifacts from the show are on display in Luray, Virginia; Nashville, Tennessee; and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. Cooter&#x27;s Place in Luray is overseen by Ben &quot;Cooter&quot; Jones from the series. The Pigeon Forge location features a gift shop and a small display of costumes, collectibles and artifacts from the show.

Covington and Conyers, Georgia, where the original five episodes were produced and filmed, have been two major tourist attractions for &quot;Dukes of Hazzard&quot; fans.

<text>Hubble&#x27;s law, also known as the Hubble–Lemaître law, is the observation in physical cosmology that galaxies are moving away from Earth at speeds proportional to their distance. In other words, the farther a galaxy is from the Earth, the faster it moves away. A galaxy&#x27;s recessional velocity is typically determined by measuring its redshift, a shift in the frequency of light emitted by the galaxy.

The discovery of Hubble&#x27;s law is attributed to work published by Edwin Hubble in 1929, but the notion of the universe expanding at a calculable rate was first derived from general relativity equations in 1922 by Alexander Friedmann. The Friedmann equations showed the universe might be expanding, and presented the expansion speed if that were the case. Before Hubble, astronomer Carl Wilhelm Wirtz had, in 1922 and 1924, deduced with his own data that galaxies that appeared smaller and dimmer had larger redshifts and thus that more distant galaxies recede faster from the observer. In 1927, Georges Lemaître concluded that the universe might be expanding by noting the proportionality of the recessional velocity of distant bodies to their respective distances. He estimated a value for this ratio, which—after Hubble confirmed cosmic expansion and determined a more precise value for it two years later—became known as the Hubble constant. Hubble inferred the recession velocity of the objects from their redshifts, many of which were earlier measured and related to velocity by Vesto Slipher in 1917. Combining Slipher&#x27;s velocities with Henrietta Swan Leavitt&#x27;s intergalactic distance calculations and methodology allowed Hubble to better calculate an expansion rate for the universe.

Hubble&#x27;s law is considered the first observational basis for the expansion of the universe, and is one of the pieces of evidence most often cited in support of the Big Bang model. The motion of astronomical objects due solely to this expansion is known as the Hubble flow. It is described by the equation , with the constant of proportionality—the Hubble constant—between the &quot;proper distance&quot; to a galaxy (which can change over time, unlike the comoving distance) and its speed of separation , i.e. the derivative of proper distance with respect to the cosmic time coordinate. Though the Hubble constant is constant at any given moment in time, the Hubble parameter , of which the Hubble constant is the current value, varies with time, so the term &quot;constant&quot; is sometimes thought of as somewhat of a misnomer.

The Hubble constant is most frequently quoted in km/s/Mpc, which gives the speed of a galaxy away as . Simplifying the units of the generalized form reveals that specifies a frequency (SI unit: s−1), leading the reciprocal of to be known as the Hubble time (14.4 billion years). The Hubble constant can also be stated as a relative rate of expansion. In this form  = 7%/Gyr, meaning that, at the current rate of expansion, it takes one billion years for an unbound structure to grow by 7%.

== Discovery ==
A decade before Hubble made his observations, a number of physicists and mathematicians had established a consistent theory of an expanding universe by using Einstein field equations of general relativity. Applying the most general principles to the nature of the universe yielded a dynamic solution that conflicted with the then-prevalent notion of a static universe.

=== Slipher&#x27;s observations ===
In 1912, Vesto M. Slipher measured the first Doppler shift of a &quot;spiral nebula&quot; (the obsolete term for spiral galaxies) and soon discovered that almost all such objects were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was highly controversial whether or not these nebulae were &quot;island universes&quot; outside the Milky Way galaxy.

=== FLRW equations ===

In 1922, Alexander Friedmann derived his Friedmann equations from Einstein field equations, showing that the universe might expand at a rate calculable by the equations. The parameter used by Friedmann is known today as the scale factor and can be considered as a scale invariant form of the proportionality constant of Hubble&#x27;s law. Georges Lemaître independently found a similar solution in his 1927 paper discussed in the following section. The Friedmann equations are derived by inserting the metric for a homogeneous and isotropic universe into Einstein&#x27;s field equations for a fluid with a given density and pressure. This idea of an expanding spacetime would eventually lead to the Big Bang and Steady State theories of cosmology.

=== Lemaître&#x27;s equation ===
In 1927, two years before Hubble published his own article, the Belgian priest and astronomer Georges Lemaître was the first to publish research deriving what is now known as Hubble&#x27;s law. According to the Canadian astronomer Sidney van den Bergh, &quot;the 1927 discovery of the expansion of the universe by Lemaître was published in French in a low-impact journal. In the 1931 high-impact English translation of this article, a critical equation was changed by omitting reference to what is now known as the Hubble constant.&quot; It is now known that the alterations in the translated paper were carried out by Lemaître himself.

=== Shape of the universe ===
Before the advent of modern cosmology, there was considerable talk about the size and shape of the universe. In 1920, the Shapley–Curtis debate took place between Harlow Shapley and Heber D. Curtis over this issue. Shapley argued for a small universe the size of the Milky Way galaxy, and Curtis argued that the universe was much larger. The issue was resolved in the coming decade with Hubble&#x27;s improved observations.

=== Cepheid variable stars outside the Milky Way ===
Edwin Hubble did most of his professional astronomical observing work at Mount Wilson Observatory, home to the world&#x27;s most powerful telescope at the time. His observations of Cepheid variable stars in &quot;spiral nebulae&quot; enabled him to calculate the distances to these objects. Surprisingly, these objects were discovered to be at distances which placed them well outside the Milky Way. They continued to be called &quot;nebulae&quot;, and it was only gradually that the term &quot;galaxies&quot; replaced it.

=== Combining redshifts with distance measurements ===

The velocities and distances that appear in Hubble&#x27;s law are not directly measured. The velocities are inferred from the redshift of radiation and distance is inferred from brightness. Hubble sought to correlate brightness with parameter .

Combining his measurements of galaxy distances with Vesto Slipher and Milton Humason&#x27;s measurements of the redshifts associated with the galaxies, Hubble discovered a rough proportionality between redshift of an object and its distance. Though there was considerable scatter (now known to be caused by peculiar velocities—the &#x27;Hubble flow&#x27; is used to refer to the region of space far enough out that the recession velocity is larger than local peculiar velocities), Hubble was able to plot a trend line from the 46 galaxies he studied and obtain a value for the Hubble constant of 500 (km/s)/Mpc (much higher than the currently accepted value due to errors in his distance calibrations; see cosmic distance ladder for details).

==== Hubble diagram ====
Hubble&#x27;s law can be easily depicted in a &quot;Hubble diagram&quot; in which the velocity (assumed approximately proportional to the redshift) of an object is plotted with respect to its distance from the observer. A straight line of positive slope on this diagram is the visual depiction of Hubble&#x27;s law.

=== Cosmological constant abandoned ===

After Hubble&#x27;s discovery was published, Albert Einstein abandoned his work on the cosmological constant, a term he had inserted into his equations of general relativity to coerce them into producing the static solution he previously considered the correct state of the universe. The Einstein equations in their simplest form model either an expanding or contracting universe, so Einstein introduced the constant to counter expansion or contraction and lead to a static and flat universe. After Hubble&#x27;s discovery that the universe was, in fact, expanding, Einstein called his faulty assumption that the universe is static his &quot;greatest mistake&quot;. On its own, general relativity could predict the expansion of the universe, which (through observations such as the bending of light by large masses, or the precession of the orbit of Mercury) could be experimentally observed and compared to his theoretical calculations using particular solutions of the equations he had originally formulated.

In 1931, Einstein went to Mount Wilson Observatory to thank Hubble for providing the observational basis for modern cosmology.

The cosmological constant has regained attention in recent decades as a hypothetical explanation for dark energy.

== Interpretation ==

The discovery of the linear relationship between redshift and distance, coupled with a supposed linear relation between recessional velocity and redshift, yields a straightforward mathematical expression for Hubble&#x27;s law as follows:

formula_1

where
* is the recessional velocity, typically expressed in km/s.
* is Hubble&#x27;s constant and corresponds to the value of (often termed the Hubble parameter which is a value that is time dependent and which can be expressed in terms of the scale factor) in the Friedmann equations taken at the time of observation denoted by the subscript . This value is the same throughout the universe for a given comoving time.
* is the proper distance (which can change over time, unlike the comoving distance, which is constant) from the galaxy to the observer, measured in mega parsecs (Mpc), in the 3-space defined by given cosmological time. (Recession velocity is just ).

Hubble&#x27;s law is considered a fundamental relation between recessional velocity and distance. However, the relation between recessional velocity and redshift depends on the cosmological model adopted and is not established except for small redshifts.

For distances larger than the radius of the Hubble sphere , objects recede at a rate faster than the speed of light (&quot;See&quot; Uses of the proper distance for a discussion of the significance of this):

formula_2

Since the Hubble &quot;constant&quot; is a constant only in space, not in time, the radius of the Hubble sphere may increase or decrease over various time intervals. The subscript &#x27;0&#x27; indicates the value of the Hubble constant today. Current evidence suggests that the expansion of the universe is accelerating (&quot;see&quot; Accelerating universe), meaning that for any given galaxy, the recession velocity is increasing over time as the galaxy moves to greater and greater distances; however, the Hubble parameter is actually thought to be decreasing with time, meaning that if we were to look at some distance and watch a series of different galaxies pass that distance, later galaxies would pass that distance at a smaller velocity than earlier ones.

=== Redshift velocity and recessional velocity ===
Redshift can be measured by determining the wavelength of a known transition, such as hydrogen α-lines for distant quasars, and finding the fractional shift compared to a stationary reference. Thus, redshift is a quantity unambiguously acquired from observation. Care is required, however, in translating these to recessional velocities: for small redshift values, a linear relation of redshift to recessional velocity applies, but more generally the redshift-distance law is nonlinear, meaning the co-relation must be derived specifically for each given model and epoch.

==== Redshift velocity ====
The redshift is often described as a &quot;redshift velocity&quot;, which is the recessional velocity that would produce the same redshift it were caused by a linear Doppler effect (which, however, is not the case, as the velocities involved are too large to use a non-relativistic formula for Doppler shift). This redshift velocity can easily exceed the speed of light. In other words, to determine the redshift velocity , the relation:

formula_3

is used. That is, there is between redshift velocity and redshift: they are rigidly proportional, and not related by any theoretical reasoning. The motivation behind the &quot;redshift velocity&quot; terminology is that the redshift velocity agrees with the velocity from a low-velocity simplification of the so-called Fizeau–Doppler formula

formula_4

Here, , are the observed and emitted wavelengths respectively. The &quot;redshift velocity&quot; is not so simply related to real velocity at larger velocities, however, and this terminology leads to confusion if interpreted as a real velocity. Next, the connection between redshift or redshift velocity and recessional velocity is discussed.

==== Recessional velocity ====

Suppose is called the &quot;scale factor&quot; of the universe, and increases as the universe expands in a manner that depends upon the cosmological model selected. Its meaning is that all measured proper distances between co-moving points increase proportionally to . (The co-moving points are not moving relative to their local environments.) In other words:

formula_5

where is some reference time. If light is emitted from a galaxy at time and received by us at , it is redshifted due to the expansion of the universe, and this redshift is simply:

formula_6

Suppose a galaxy is at distance , and this distance changes with time at a rate . We call this rate of recession the &quot;recession velocity&quot; :

formula_7

We now define the Hubble constant as

formula_8

and discover the Hubble law:

formula_9

From this perspective, Hubble&#x27;s law is a fundamental relation between (i) the recessional velocity associated with the expansion of the universe and (ii) the distance to an object; the connection between redshift and distance is a crutch used to connect Hubble&#x27;s law with observations. This law can be related to redshift approximately by making a Taylor series expansion:

formula_10

If the distance is not too large, all other complications of the model become small corrections, and the time interval is simply the distance divided by the speed of light:

formula_11

or

formula_12

According to this approach, the relation is an approximation valid at low redshifts, to be replaced by a relation at large redshifts that is model-dependent. See velocity-redshift figure.

=== Observability of parameters ===
Strictly speaking, neither nor in the formula are directly observable, because they are properties of a galaxy, whereas our observations refer to the galaxy in the past, at the time that the light we currently see left it.

For relatively nearby galaxies (redshift much less than one), and will not have changed much, and can be estimated using the formula where is the speed of light. This gives the empirical relation found by Hubble.

For distant galaxies, (or ) cannot be calculated from without specifying a detailed model for how changes with time. The redshift is not even directly related to the recession velocity at the time the light set out, but it does have a simple interpretation: is the factor by which the universe has expanded while the photon was traveling towards the observer.

=== Expansion velocity vs. peculiar velocity ===
In using Hubble&#x27;s law to determine distances, only the velocity due to the expansion of the universe can be used. Since gravitationally interacting galaxies move relative to each other independent of the expansion of the universe, these relative velocities, called peculiar velocities, need to be accounted for in the application of Hubble&#x27;s law. Such peculiar velocities give rise to redshift-space distortions.

=== Time-dependence of Hubble parameter ===

The parameter is commonly called the &quot;Hubble constant&quot;, but that is a misnomer since it is constant in space only at a fixed time; it varies with time in nearly all cosmological models, and all observations of far distant objects are also observations into the distant past, when the &quot;constant&quot; had a different value. &quot;Hubble parameter&quot; is a more correct term, with denoting the present-day value.

Another common source of confusion is that the accelerating universe does imply that the Hubble parameter is actually increasing with time; since in most accelerating models formula_13 increases relatively faster than so decreases with time. (The recession velocity of one chosen galaxy does increase, but different galaxies passing a sphere of fixed radius cross the sphere more slowly at later times.)

On defining the dimensionless deceleration parameter it follows that

formula_14

From this it is seen that the Hubble parameter is decreasing with time, unless ; the latter can only occur if the universe contains phantom energy, regarded as theoretically somewhat improbable.

However, in the standard Lambda cold dark matter model (Lambda-CDM or ΛCDM model), will tend to −1 from above in the distant future as the cosmological constant becomes increasingly dominant over matter; this implies that will approach from above to a constant value of ≈ 57 (km/s)/Mpc, and the scale factor of the universe will then grow exponentially in time.

=== Idealized Hubble&#x27;s law ===
The mathematical derivation of an idealized Hubble&#x27;s law for a uniformly expanding universe is a fairly elementary theorem of geometry in 3-dimensional Cartesian/Newtonian coordinate space, which, considered as a metric space, is entirely homogeneous and isotropic (properties do not vary with location or direction). Simply stated, the theorem is this:

In fact, this applies to non-Cartesian spaces as long as they are locally homogeneous and isotropic, specifically to the negatively and positively curved spaces frequently considered as cosmological models (see shape of the universe).

An observation stemming from this theorem is that seeing objects recede from us on Earth is not an indication that Earth is near to a center from which the expansion is occurring, but rather that observer in an expanding universe will see objects receding from them.

=== Ultimate fate and age of the universe ===
The value of the Hubble parameter changes over time, either increasing or decreasing depending on the value of the so-called deceleration parameter , which is defined by

formula_15

In a universe with a deceleration parameter equal to zero, it follows that , where is the time since the Big Bang. A non-zero, time-dependent value of simply requires integration of the Friedmann equations backwards from the present time to the time when the comoving horizon size was zero.

It was long thought that was positive, indicating that the expansion is slowing down due to gravitational attraction. This would imply an age of the universe less than (which is about 14 billion years). For instance, a value for of 1/2 (once favoured by most theorists) would give the age of the universe as . The discovery in 1998 that is apparently negative means that the universe could actually be older than . However, estimates of the age of the universe are very close to .

=== Olbers&#x27; paradox ===

The expansion of space summarized by the Big Bang interpretation of Hubble&#x27;s law is relevant to the old conundrum known as Olbers&#x27; paradox: If the universe were infinite in size, static, and filled with a uniform distribution of stars, then every line of sight in the sky would end on a star, and the sky would be as bright as the surface of a star. However, the night sky is largely dark.

Since the 17th century, astronomers and other thinkers have proposed many possible ways to resolve this paradox, but the currently accepted resolution depends in part on the Big Bang theory, and in part on the Hubble expansion: in a universe that existed for a finite amount of time, only the light of a finite number of stars has had enough time to reach us, and the paradox is resolved. Additionally, in an expanding universe, distant objects recede from us, which causes the light emanated from them to be redshifted and diminished in brightness by the time we see it.

=== Dimensionless Hubble constant ===
Instead of working with Hubble&#x27;s constant, a common practice is to introduce the dimensionless Hubble constant, usually denoted by and commonly referred to as &quot;little h&quot;, then to write Hubble&#x27;s constant as , all the relative uncertainty of the true value of being then relegated to . The dimensionless Hubble constant is often used when giving distances that are calculated from redshift using the formula . Since is not precisely known, the distance is expressed as:

formula_16

In other words, one calculates 2998 × and one gives the units as Mpc  or  Mpc.

Occasionally a reference value other than 100 may be chosen, in which case a subscript is presented after to avoid confusion; e.g. denotes  , which implies .

This should not be confused with the dimensionless value of Hubble&#x27;s constant, usually expressed in terms of Planck units, obtained by multiplying by (from definitions of parsec and ), for example for , a Planck unit version of is obtained.

=== Acceleration of the expansion ===

A value for measured from standard candle observations of Type Ia supernovae, which was determined in 1998 to be negative, surprised many astronomers with the implication that the expansion of the universe is currently &quot;accelerating&quot; (although the Hubble factor is still decreasing with time, as mentioned above in the Interpretation section; see the articles on dark energy and the ΛCDM model).

== Derivation of the Hubble parameter ==
Start with the Friedmann equation:

formula_17

where is the Hubble parameter, is the scale factor, is the gravitational constant, is the normalised spatial curvature of the universe and equal to −1, 0, or 1, and is the cosmological constant.

=== Matter-dominated universe (with a cosmological constant) ===

If the universe is matter-dominated, then the mass density of the universe can be taken to include just matter so

formula_18

where is the density of matter today. From the Friedmann equation and thermodynamic principles we know for non-relativistic particles that their mass density decreases proportional to the inverse volume of the universe, so the equation above must be true. We can also define (see density parameter for )

formula_19

therefore:

formula_20

Also, by definition,
formula_21

where the subscript refers to the values today, and . Substituting all of this into the Friedmann equation at the start of this section and replacing with gives

formula_22

=== Matter- and dark energy-dominated universe ===

If the universe is both matter-dominated and dark energy-dominated, then the above equation for the Hubble parameter will also be a function of the equation of state of dark energy. So now:

formula_23

where is the mass density of the dark energy. By definition, an equation of state in cosmology is , and if this is substituted into the fluid equation, which describes how the mass density of the universe evolves with time, then

formula_24

If is constant, then

formula_25

implying:

formula_26

Therefore, for dark energy with a constant equation of state , If this is substituted into the Friedman equation in a similar way as before, but this time set , which assumes a spatially flat universe, then (see shape of the universe)

formula_27

If the dark energy derives from a cosmological constant such as that introduced by Einstein, it can be shown that . The equation then reduces to the last equation in the matter-dominated universe section, with set to zero. In that case the initial dark energy density is given by

formula_28

If dark energy does not have a constant equation-of-state , then

formula_29

and to solve this, must be parametrized, for example if , giving

formula_30

== Units derived from the Hubble constant ==
=== Hubble time ===
The Hubble constant has units of inverse time; the Hubble time is simply defined as the inverse of the Hubble constant, i.e.

formula_31

This is slightly different from the age of the universe, which is approximately 13.8 billion years. The Hubble time is the age it would have had if the expansion had been linear, and it is different from the real age of the universe because the expansion is not linear; it depends on the energy content of the universe (see ).

We currently appear to be approaching a period where the expansion of the universe is exponential due to the increasing dominance of vacuum energy. In this regime, the Hubble parameter is constant, and the universe grows by a factor  each Hubble time:

formula_32

Likewise, the generally accepted value of 2.27 Es−1 means that (at the current rate) the universe would grow by a factor of in one exasecond.

Over long periods of time, the dynamics are complicated by general relativity, dark energy, inflation, etc., as explained above.

=== Hubble length ===
The Hubble length or Hubble distance is a unit of distance in cosmology, defined as — the speed of light multiplied by the Hubble time. It is equivalent to 4,420 million parsecs or 14.4 billion light years. (The numerical value of the Hubble length in light years is, by definition, equal to that of the Hubble time in years.) Substituting into the equation for Hubble&#x27;s law, reveals that the Hubble distance specifies the distance from our location to those galaxies which are receding from us at the speed of light

=== Hubble volume ===

The Hubble volume is sometimes defined as a volume of the universe with a comoving size of . The exact definition varies: it is sometimes defined as the volume of a sphere with radius , or alternatively, a cube of side . Some cosmologists even use the term Hubble volume to refer to the volume of the observable universe, although this has a radius approximately three times larger.

== Determining the Hubble constant ==

The value of the Hubble constant, , cannot be measured directly, but is derived from a combination of astronomical observations and model-dependent assumptions. Increasingly accurate observations and new models over many decades have led to two sets of highly precise values which do not agree. This difference is known as the &quot;Hubble tension&quot;.

=== Earlier measurements ===
For the original 1929 estimate of the constant now bearing his name, Hubble used observations of Cepheid variable stars as &quot;standard candles&quot; to measure distance. The result he obtained was , much larger than the value astronomers currently calculate. Later observations by astronomer Walter Baade led him to realize that there were distinct &quot;populations&quot; for stars (Population I and Population II) in a galaxy. The same observations led him to discover that there are two types of Cepheid variable stars with different luminosities. Using this discovery, he recalculated Hubble constant and the size of the known universe, doubling the previous calculation made by Hubble in 1929. He announced this finding to considerable astonishment at the 1952 meeting of the International Astronomical Union in Rome.

For most of the second half of the 20th century, the value of was estimated to be between .

The value of the Hubble constant was the topic of a long and rather bitter controversy between Gérard de Vaucouleurs, who claimed the value was around 100, and Allan Sandage, who claimed the value was near 50. In one demonstration of vitriol shared between the parties, when Sandage and Gustav Andreas Tammann (Sandage&#x27;s research colleague) formally acknowledged the shortcomings of confirming the systematic error of their method in 1975, Vaucouleurs responded &quot;It is unfortunate that this sober warning was so soon forgotten and ignored by most astronomers and textbook writers&quot;. In 1996, a debate moderated by John Bahcall between Sidney van den Bergh and Gustav Tammann was held in similar fashion to the earlier Shapley–Curtis debate over these two competing values.

This previously wide variance in estimates was partially resolved with the introduction of the ΛCDM model of the universe in the late 1990s. Incorporating the ΛCDM model, observations of high-redshift clusters at X-ray and microwave wavelengths using the Sunyaev–Zel&#x27;dovich effect, measurements of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation, and optical surveys all gave a value of around 50–70 km/s/Mpc for the constant.

=== Precision cosmology and the Hubble tension ===
By the late 1990s, advances in ideas and technology allowed higher precision measurements.
However, two major categories of methods, each with high precision, fail to agree.
&quot;Late universe&quot; measurements using calibrated distance ladder techniques have converged on a value of approximately . Since 2000, &quot;early universe&quot; techniques based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background have become available, and these agree on a value near . (This accounts for the change in the expansion rate since the early universe, so is comparable to the first number.) Initially, this discrepancy was within the estimated measurement uncertainties and thus no cause for concern. However, as techniques have improved, the estimated measurement uncertainties have shrunk, but the discrepancies have &quot;not&quot;, to the point that the disagreement is now highly statistically significant. This discrepancy is called the Hubble tension.

An example of an &quot;early&quot; measurement, the Planck mission published in 2018 gives a value for of . In the &quot;late&quot; camp is the higher value of determined by the Hubble Space Telescope 
and confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope in 2023.
The &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late&quot; measurements disagree at the &gt;5 &quot;σ&quot; level, beyond a plausible level of chance. The resolution to this disagreement is an ongoing area of active research. 

=== Reducing systematic errors ===
Since 2013 much effort has gone in to new measurements to check for possible systematic errors and improved reproducibility.

The &quot;late universe&quot; or distance ladder measurements typically employ three stages or &quot;rungs&quot;. In the first rung distances to Cepheids are determined while trying to reduce luminosity errors from dust and correlations of metallicity with luminosity. The second rung uses 
Type Ia supernova, explosions of almost constant amount of mass and thus very similar amounts of light; the primary source of systematic error is the limited number of objects that can be observed. The third rung of the distance ladder measures the red-shift of supernova to extract the Hubble flow and from that the constant. At this rung corrections due to motion other than expansion are applied. 
As an example of the kind of work needed to reduce systematic errors, photometry on observations from the James Webb Space Telescope of extra-galactic Cepheids confirm the findings from the HST. The higher resolution avoided confusion from crowding of stars in the field of view but came to the same value for H0.

The &quot;early universe&quot; or inverse distance ladder measures the observable consequences of spherical sound waves on primordial plasma density. These pressure waves – called baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) – cease once the universe cooled enough for electrons to stay bound to nuclei, ending the plasma and allowing the photons trapped by interaction with the plasma to escape. The pressure waves then become very small perturbations in density imprinted on the cosmic microwave background and on the large scale density of galaxies across the sky. Detailed structure in high precision measurements of the CMB can matched to physics models of the oscillations. These models depend upon the Hubble constant such that a match reveals a value for the constant. Similarly, the BAO affects the statistical distribution of matter, observed as distant galaxies across the sky. These two independent kinds of measurements produce similar values for the constant from the current models, giving strong evidence that systematic errors in the measurements themselves do not affect the result.

=== Other kinds of measurements ===
In addition to measurements based on calibrated distance ladder techniques or measurements of the CMB, other methods have been used to determine the Hubble constant. 

In October 2018, scientists used information from gravitational wave events (especially those involving the merger of neutron stars, like GW170817), of determining the Hubble constant.

In July 2019, astronomers reported that a new method to determine the Hubble constant, and resolve the discrepancy of earlier methods, has been proposed based on the mergers of pairs of neutron stars, following the detection of the neutron star merger of GW170817, an event known as a dark siren. Their measurement of the Hubble constant is (km/s)/Mpc.

Also in July 2019, astronomers reported another new method, using data from the Hubble Space Telescope and based on distances to red giant stars calculated using the tip of the red-giant branch (TRGB) distance indicator. Their measurement of the Hubble constant is .

In February 2020, the Megamaser Cosmology Project published independent results based on astrophysical masers visible at cosmological distances and which do not require multi-step calibration. That work confirmed the distance ladder results and differed from the early-universe results at a statistical significance level of 95%. 

In July 2020, measurements of the cosmic background radiation by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope predict that the Universe should be expanding more slowly than is currently observed.

In July 2023, an independent estimate of the Hubble constant was derived from a kilonova, the optical afterglow of a neutron star merger, using the expanding photosphere method. Due to the blackbody nature of early kilonova spectra, such systems provide strongly constraining estimators of cosmic distance. Using the kilonova AT2017gfo (the aftermath of, once again, GW170817), these measurements indicate a local-estimate of the Hubble constant of .
=== Possible resolutions of the Hubble tension ===
The cause of the Hubble tension is unknown, and there are many possible proposed solutions. The most conservative is that there is an unknown systematic error affecting either early-universe or late-universe observations. Although intuitively appealing, this explanation requires multiple unrelated effects regardless of whether early-universe or late-universe observations are incorrect, and there are no obvious candidates. Furthermore, any such systematic error would need to affect multiple different instruments, since both the early-universe and late-universe observations come from several different telescopes.

Alternatively, it could be that the observations are correct, but some unaccounted-for effect is causing the discrepancy. If the cosmological principle fails (see ), then the existing interpretations of the Hubble constant and the Hubble tension have to be revised, which might resolve the Hubble tension. In particular, we would need to be located within a very large void, up to about a redshift of 0.5, for such an explanation to conflate with supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillation observations. Yet another possibility is that the uncertainties in the measurements could have been underestimated, but given the internal agreements this is neither likely, nor resolves the overall tension.

Finally, another possibility is new physics beyond the currently accepted cosmological model of the universe, the ΛCDM model. There are very many theories in this category, for example, replacing general relativity with a modified theory of gravity could potentially resolve the tension, as can a dark energy component in the early universe, dark energy with a time-varying equation of state, or dark matter that decays into dark radiation. A problem faced by all these theories is that both early-universe and late-universe measurements rely on multiple independent lines of physics, and it is difficult to modify any of those lines while preserving their successes elsewhere. The scale of the challenge can be seen from how some authors have argued that new early-universe physics alone is not sufficient; while other authors argue that new late-universe physics alone is also not sufficient. Nonetheless, astronomers are trying, with interest in the Hubble tension growing strongly since the mid 2010s.
