<text>Wide Area Information Server (WAIS) is a client–server text searching system that uses the ANSI Standard Z39.50 Information Retrieval Service Definition and Protocol Specifications for Library Applications&quot; (Z39.50:1988) to search index databases on remote computers. It was developed in 1990 as a project of Thinking Machines, Apple Computer, Dow Jones, and KPMG Peat Marwick. 

WAIS did not adhere to either the standard nor its OSI framework (adopting instead TCP/IP) but created a unique protocol inspired by Z39.50:1988.

== History ==

The WAIS protocol and servers were promoted by Thinking Machines Corporation (TMC) of Cambridge, Massachusetts. TMC-produced WAIS servers ran on their massively parallel CM-2 (Connection Machine) and SPARC-based CM-5 MP supercomputers. WAIS clients were developed for various operating systems and windowing systems including Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, NeXT, X, GNU Emacs, and character terminals. TMC released a free open source software version of WAIS for Unix in 1991. 

Inspired by the WAIS project on full-text databases and emerging SGML projects, Z39.50 version 2 (Z39.50:1992) was released. Unlike its 1988 predecessor, it was a compatible superset of the international ISO 10162/10163 standard.

With the advent of Z39.50:1992, the termination of support for free WAIS by Thinking Machines and the establishment of WAIS Inc as a commercial venture, the U.S. National Science Foundation funded the Clearinghouse for Networked Information Discovery and Retrieval (CNIDR) to promote Internet search and discovery systems, open source and standards. CNIDR created a new, free open-source WAIS. This was the first freeWAIS based on the wais-8-b5 codebase of TMC, with a wholly new software suite Isite based upon Z39.50:1992 using Isearch as its full-text search engine.

Ulrich Pfeifer and Norbert Gövert of the computer science department of the University of Dortmund extended the CNIDR freeWAIS code to become freeWAIS-sf with structured fields as its main improvement. Ulrich Pfeifer rewrote freeWAIS-sf in Perl, becoming WAIT.

Inspired by WAIS&#x27; &quot;Directory of Servers&quot;, Eliot Christian of USGS envisioned GILS: Government Information Locator Service. GILS (based upon Z39.50:1992 with some extensions) became a U.S. Federal mandate as part of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 ().

==Directory of Servers==

Thinking Machines Corp provided a service called the Directory of Servers. It was a WAIS server like any other information source except containing information about the other WAIS servers on the Internet. A WAIS server with TMC WAIS code creates a special record containing metadata plus some common words describing its indexed content. The record is uploaded to the central server and indexed along with the records from other public servers. The directory can be searched to find servers that might have content relevant to a specific field of interest. This model of searching for (WAIS) servers to search became the model for GILS and Peter Deutsch&#x27;s WHOIS++ distributed white pages directory.

==People==

Two of the developers of WAIS, Brewster Kahle and Harry Morris, left Thinking Machines to found WAIS Inc in Menlo Park, California, with Bruce Gilliat. WAIS Inc. was originally a joint project between Apple Computer, Peat Marwick, Dow Jones, and Thinking Machines. In 1992, the presidential campaign of Ross Perot used the WAIS product as a campaign wide information system, connecting the field offices to the national office. Later, Perot Systems adopted WAIS to better access the information in its corporate databases. Other early clients were the Environmental Protection Agency, Library of Congress, and the Department of Energy and later the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

WAIS Inc was sold to AOL in May 1995 for $15 million. Following the sale, Margaret St. Pierre left WAIS Inc to start Blue Angel Technologies. Her WAIS variant formed the basis of MetaStar. Georgios Papadopoulos left to found Atypon. François Schiettecatte left Human Genome Project at Johns Hopkins Hospital and started FS-Consult and developed his own variant of WAIS which eventually became ScienceServer, which was later sold to Elsevier Science. Kahle and Gilliat went on to found the Internet Archive and Alexa Internet.

==WAIS and Gopher==
Public WAIS is often used as a full-text search engine for individual Internet Gopher servers, supplementing the popular Veronica system which only searches the menu titles of Gopher sites. WAIS and Gopher share the World Wide Web&#x27;s client–server architecture and a certain amount of its functionality. The WAIS protocol is influenced largely by the z39.50 protocol designed for networking library catalogs. It allows a text-based search, and retrieval following a search. Gopher provides a free text search mechanism, but principally uses menus. A menu is a list of titles, from which the user may pick one. While Gopher Space is a web containing many loops, the menu system gives the user the impression of a tree.

The Web&#x27;s data model is similar to the gopher model, except that menus are generalized to hypertext documents. In both cases, simple file servers generate the menus or hypertext directly from the file structure of a server. The Web&#x27;s hypertext model permits the author more freedom to communicate the options available to the reader, as it can include headings and various forms of list structure.

<text>A waveguide is a structure that guides waves by restricting the transmission of energy to one direction. Common types of waveguides include acoustic waveguides which direct sound, optical waveguides which direct light, and radio-frequency waveguides which direct electromagnetic waves other than light like radio waves.

Without the physical constraint of a waveguide, waves would expand into three-dimensional space and their intensities would decrease according to the inverse square law.

There are different types of waveguides for different types of waves. The original and most common meaning is a hollow conductive metal pipe used to carry high frequency radio waves, particularly microwaves. Dielectric waveguides are used at higher radio frequencies, and transparent dielectric waveguides and optical fibers serve as waveguides for light. In acoustics, air ducts and horns are used as waveguides for sound in musical instruments and loudspeakers, and specially-shaped metal rods conduct ultrasonic waves in ultrasonic machining.

The geometry of a waveguide reflects its function; in addition to more common types that channel the wave in one dimension, there are two-dimensional slab waveguides which confine waves to two dimensions. The frequency of the transmitted wave also dictates the size of a waveguide: each waveguide has a cutoff wavelength determined by its size and will not conduct waves of greater wavelength; an optical fiber that guides light will not transmit microwaves which have a much larger wavelength. Some naturally occurring structures can also act as waveguides. The SOFAR channel layer in the ocean can guide the sound of whale song across enormous distances.
Any shape of cross section of waveguide can support EM waves. Irregular shapes are difficult to analyse. Commonly used waveguides are rectangular and circular in shape.

== Uses ==

The uses of waveguides for transmitting signals were known even before the term was coined. The phenomenon of sound waves guided through a taut wire have been known for a long time, as well as sound through a hollow pipe such as a cave or medical stethoscope. Other uses of waveguides are in transmitting power between the components of a system such as radio, radar or optical devices. Waveguides are the fundamental principle of guided wave testing (GWT), one of the many methods of non-destructive evaluation.

Specific examples:
* Optical fibers transmit light and signals for long distances with low attenuation and a wide usable range of wavelengths.
* In a microwave oven a waveguide transfers power from the magnetron, where waves are formed, to the cooking chamber.
* In a radar, a waveguide transfers radio frequency energy to and from the antenna, where the impedance needs to be matched for efficient power transmission (see below).
* Rectangular and circular waveguides are commonly used to connect feeds of parabolic dishes to their electronics, either low-noise receivers or power amplifier/transmitters.
* Waveguides are used in scientific instruments to measure optical, acoustic and elastic properties of materials and objects. The waveguide can be put in contact with the specimen (as in a medical ultrasonography), in which case the waveguide ensures that the power of the testing wave is conserved, or the specimen may be put inside the waveguide (as in a dielectric constant measurement, so that smaller objects can be tested and the accuracy is better.
* A transmission line is a commonly used specific type of waveguide.

== History ==

The first structure for guiding waves was proposed by J. J. Thomson in 1893, and was first experimentally tested by Oliver Lodge in 1894. The first mathematical analysis of electromagnetic waves in a metal cylinder was performed by Lord Rayleigh in 1897. For sound waves, Lord Rayleigh published a full mathematical analysis of propagation modes in his seminal work, &quot;The Theory of Sound&quot;. Jagadish Chandra Bose researched millimeter wavelengths using waveguides, and in 1897 described to the Royal Institution in London his research carried out in Kolkata.

The study of dielectric waveguides (such as optical fibers, see below) began as early as the 1920s, by several people, most famous of which are Rayleigh, Sommerfeld and Debye. Optical fiber began to receive special attention in the 1960s due to its importance to the communications industry.

The development of radio communication initially occurred at the lower frequencies because these could be more easily propagated over large distances. The long wavelengths made these frequencies unsuitable for use in hollow metal waveguides because of the impractically large diameter tubes required. Consequently, research into hollow metal waveguides stalled and the work of Lord Rayleigh was forgotten for a time and had to be rediscovered by others. Practical investigations resumed in the 1930s by George C. Southworth at Bell Labs and Wilmer L. Barrow at MIT. Southworth at first took the theory from papers on waves in dielectric rods because the work of Lord Rayleigh was unknown to him. This misled him somewhat; some of his experiments failed because he was not aware of the phenomenon of waveguide cutoff frequency already found in Lord Rayleigh&#x27;s work. Serious theoretical work was taken up by John R. Carson and Sallie P. Mead. This work led to the discovery that for the TE01 mode in circular waveguide losses go down with frequency and at one time this was a serious contender for the format for long-distance telecommunications.

The importance of radar in World War II gave a great impetus to waveguide research, at least on the Allied side. The magnetron, developed in 1940 by John Randall and Harry Boot at the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, provided a good power source and made microwave radar feasible. The most important centre of US research was at the Radiation Laboratory (Rad Lab) at MIT but many others took part in the US, and in the UK such as the Telecommunications Research Establishment. The head of the Fundamental Development Group at Rad Lab was Edward Mills Purcell. His researchers included Julian Schwinger, Nathan Marcuvitz, Carol Gray Montgomery, and Robert H. Dicke. Much of the Rad Lab work concentrated on finding lumped element models of waveguide structures so that components in waveguide could be analysed with standard circuit theory. Hans Bethe was also briefly at Rad Lab, but while there he produced his small aperture theory which proved important for waveguide cavity filters, first developed at Rad Lab. The German side, on the other hand, largely ignored the potential of waveguides in radar until very late in the war. So much so that when radar parts from a downed British plane were sent to Siemens &amp; Halske for analysis, even though they were recognised as microwave components, their purpose could not be identified.

German academics were even allowed to continue publicly publishing their research in this field because it was not felt to be important.

Immediately after World War II waveguide was the technology of choice in the microwave field. However, it has some problems; it is bulky, expensive to produce, and the cutoff frequency effect makes it difficult to produce wideband devices. Ridged waveguide can increase bandwidth beyond an octave, but a better solution is to use a technology working in TEM mode (that is, non-waveguide) such as coaxial conductors since TEM does not have a cutoff frequency. A shielded rectangular conductor can also be used and this has certain manufacturing advantages over coax and can be seen as the forerunner of the planar technologies (stripline and microstrip). However, planar technologies really started to take off when printed circuits were introduced. These methods are significantly cheaper than waveguide and have largely taken its place in most bands. However, waveguide is still favoured in the higher microwave bands from around Ku band upwards.

== Properties ==

=== Propagation modes and cutoff frequencies ===
A propagation mode in a waveguide is one solution of the wave equations, or, in other words, the form of the wave. Due to the constraints of the boundary conditions, there are only limited frequencies and forms for the wave function which can propagate in the waveguide. The lowest frequency in which a certain mode can propagate is the cutoff frequency of that mode. The mode with the lowest cutoff frequency is the fundamental mode of the waveguide, and its cutoff frequency is the waveguide cutoff frequency.

Propagation modes are computed by solving the Helmholtz equation alongside a set of boundary conditions depending on the geometrical shape and materials bounding the region. The usual assumption for infinitely long uniform waveguides allows us to assume a propagating form for the wave, i.e. stating that every field component has a known dependency on the propagation direction (i.e. formula_1). More specifically, the common approach is to first replace all unknown time-varying fields formula_2 (assuming for simplicity to describe the fields in cartesian components) with their complex phasors representation formula_3, sufficient to fully describe any infinitely long single-tone signal at frequency formula_4, (angular frequency formula_5), and rewrite the Helmholtz equation and boundary conditions accordingly. Then, every unknown field is forced to have a form like formula_6, where the formula_7 term represents the propagation constant (still unknown) along the direction along which the waveguide extends to infinity. The Helmholtz equation can be rewritten to accommodate such form and the resulting equality needs to be solved for formula_7 and formula_9, yielding in the end an eigenvalue equation for formula_7 and a corresponding eigenfunction formula_11for each solution of the former.

The propagation constant formula_7 of the guided wave is complex, in general. For a lossless case, the propagation constant might be found to take on either real or imaginary values, depending on the chosen solution of the eigenvalue equation and on the angular frequency formula_13. When formula_7 is purely real, the mode is said to be &quot;below cutoff&quot;, since the amplitude of the field phasors tends to exponentially decrease with propagation; an imaginary formula_7, instead, represents modes said to be &quot;in propagation&quot; or &quot;above cutoff&quot;, as the complex amplitude of the phasors does not change with formula_1.

=== Impedance matching ===
In circuit theory, the impedance is a generalization of electrical resistance in the case of alternating current, and is measured in ohms (formula_17). A waveguide in circuit theory is described by a transmission line having a length and characteristic impedance. In other words, the impedance indicates the ratio of voltage to current of the circuit component (in this case a waveguide) during propagation of the wave. This description of the waveguide was originally intended for alternating current, but is also suitable for electromagnetic and sound waves, once the wave and material properties (such as pressure, density, dielectric constant) are properly converted into electrical terms (current and impedance for example).

Impedance matching is important when components of an electric circuit are connected (waveguide to antenna for example): The impedance ratio determines how much of the wave is transmitted forward and how much is reflected. In connecting a waveguide to an antenna a complete transmission is usually required, so an effort is made to match their impedances.

The reflection coefficient can be calculated using: formula_18, where formula_19 (Gamma) is the reflection coefficient (0 denotes full transmission, 1 full reflection, and 0.5 is a reflection of half the incoming voltage), formula_20 and formula_21 are the impedance of the first component (from which the wave enters) and the second component, respectively.

An impedance mismatch creates a reflected wave, which added to the incoming waves creates a standing wave. An impedance mismatch can be also quantified with the standing wave ratio (SWR or VSWR for voltage), which is connected to the impedance ratio and reflection coefficient by: formula_22, where formula_23 are the minimum and maximum values of the voltage absolute value, and the VSWR is the voltage standing wave ratio, which value of 1 denotes full transmission, without reflection and thus no standing wave, while very large values mean high reflection and standing wave pattern.

== Electromagnetic waveguides ==

=== Radio-frequency waveguides ===

Waveguides can be constructed to carry waves over a wide portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, but are especially useful in the microwave and optical frequency ranges. Depending on the frequency, they can be constructed from either conductive or dielectric materials. Waveguides are used for transferring both power and communication signals.

=== Optical waveguides ===

Waveguides used at optical frequencies are typically dielectric waveguides, structures in which a dielectric material with high permittivity, and thus high index of refraction, is surrounded by a material with lower permittivity. The structure guides optical waves by total internal reflection. An example of an optical waveguide is optical fiber.

Other types of optical waveguide are also used, including photonic-crystal fiber, which guides waves by any of several distinct mechanisms. Guides in the form of a hollow tube with a highly reflective inner surface have also been used as light pipes for illumination applications. The inner surfaces may be polished metal, or may be covered with a multilayer film that guides light by Bragg reflection (this is a special case of a photonic-crystal fiber). One can also use small prisms around the pipe which reflect light via total internal reflection —such confinement is necessarily imperfect, however, since total internal reflection can never truly guide light within a &quot;lower&quot;-index core (in the prism case, some light leaks out at the prism corners).

== Acoustic waveguides ==
An &quot;acoustic waveguide&quot; is a physical structure for guiding sound waves. Sound in an acoustic waveguide behaves like electromagnetic waves on a transmission line. Waves on a string, like the ones in a tin can telephone, are a simple example of an acoustic waveguide. Another example are pressure waves in the pipes of an organ. The term &quot;acoustic waveguide&quot; is also used to describe elastic waves guided in micro-scale devices, like those employed in piezoelectric delay lines and in stimulated Brillouin scattering.

== Mathematical waveguides ==
Waveguides are interesting objects of study from a strictly mathematical perspective. A waveguide (or tube) is defined as type of boundary condition on the wave equation such that the wave function must be equal to zero on the boundary and that the allowed region is finite in all dimensions but one (an infinitely long cylinder is an example.) A large number of interesting results can be proven from these general conditions. It turns out that any tube with a bulge (where the width of the tube increases) admits at least one bound state that exist inside the mode gaps. The frequencies of all the bound states can be identified by using a pulse short in time. This can be shown using the variational principles. An interesting result by Jeffrey Goldstone and Robert Jaffe is that any tube of constant width with a twist, admits a bound state.

== Sound synthesis ==
Sound synthesis uses digital delay lines as computational elements to simulate wave propagation in tubes of wind instruments and the vibrating strings of string instruments.

<text>The wave impedance of an electromagnetic wave is the ratio of the transverse components of the electric and magnetic fields (the transverse components being those at right angles to the direction of propagation). For a transverse-electric-magnetic (TEM) plane wave traveling through a homogeneous medium, the wave impedance is everywhere equal to the intrinsic impedance of the medium. In particular, for a plane wave travelling through empty space, the wave impedance is equal to the impedance of free space. The symbol &quot;Z&quot; is used to represent it and it is expressed in units of ohms. The symbol &quot;η&quot; (eta) may be used instead of &quot;Z&quot; for wave impedance to avoid confusion with electrical impedance.

== Definition ==

The wave impedance is given by
: formula_1
where formula_2 is the electric field and formula_3 is the magnetic field, in phasor representation. The impedance is, in general, a complex number.

In terms of the parameters of an electromagnetic wave and the medium it travels through, the wave impedance is given by
: formula_4
where &quot;μ&quot; is the magnetic permeability, &quot;ε&quot; is the (real) electric permittivity and &quot;σ&quot; is the electrical conductivity of the material the wave is travelling through (corresponding to the imaginary component of the permittivity multiplied by omega). In the equation, &quot;j&quot; is the imaginary unit, and &quot;ω&quot; is the angular frequency of the wave. Just as for electrical impedance, the impedance is a function of frequency. In the case of an ideal dielectric (where the conductivity is zero), the equation reduces to the real number
: formula_5

== In free space ==
In free space the wave impedance of plane waves is: 
: formula_6
(where &quot;ε&quot;0 is the permittivity constant in free space and &quot;μ&quot;0 is the permeability constant in free space). Now, since
: formula_7 (by definition of the metre),
: formula_8.

Hence the value essentially depends on formula_9.

The currently accepted value of formula_10 is 

== In an unbounded dielectric ==

In an isotropic, homogeneous dielectric with negligible magnetic properties, i.e. formula_11 and formula_12. So, the value of wave impedance in a perfect dielectric is
: formula_13,
where formula_14 is the relative dielectric constant.

== In a waveguide ==

For any waveguide in the form of a hollow metal tube, (such as rectangular guide, circular guide, or double-ridge guide), the wave impedance of a travelling wave is dependent on the frequency formula_15, but is the same throughout the guide. For transverse electric (TE) modes of propagation the wave impedance is:
: formula_16
where &quot;f&quot;&quot;c&quot; is the cut-off frequency of the mode, and for transverse magnetic (TM) modes of propagation the wave impedance is:
: formula_17

Above the cut-off (), the impedance is real (resistive) and the wave carries energy. Below cut-off the impedance is imaginary (reactive) and the wave is evanescent. These expressions neglect the effect of resistive loss in the walls of the waveguide. For a waveguide entirely filled with a homogeneous dielectric medium, similar expressions apply, but with the wave impedance of the medium replacing &quot;Z&quot;0. The presence of the dielectric also modifies the cut-off frequency &quot;f&quot;&quot;c&quot;.

For a waveguide or transmission line containing more than one type of dielectric medium (such as microstrip), the wave impedance will in general vary over the cross-section of the line.

<doc id="41867" wikidata="Q7998555" url="?curid=41867" title="Wide Area Telephone Service">
<text>Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS) was a flat-rate long-distance service for customer dial-type telecommunications in the service areas of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP).

The service was between a given customer phone (also known as a &quot;station&quot;) and stations within specified geographic rate areas, employing a single telephone line between the customer location and the serving central office. Each access line could be arranged for outward (OUT-WATS) or inward (IN-WATS) service, or both.

WATS was introduced by the Bell System in 1961 as a long-distance flat-rate plan by which a business could obtain a special line with an included number of hours (&#x27;measured time&#x27; or &#x27;full-time&#x27;) of long-distance calling to a specified area. These lines were most often connected to private branch exchanges in large businesses. WATS lines were the basis for the first direct-dial toll-free 1-800-numbers (intrastate in 1966, interstate in 1967); by 1976, WATS brought AT&amp;T Corporation a billion dollars in annual revenue ($ in dollars)

For outbound calls, the 1984 AT&amp;T divestiture brought multiple competitors offering similar services using standard business telephone lines; the special WATS line was ultimately supplanted by other flat-rate offerings. The requirement that an inbound toll-free number terminate at a special WATS line or fixed-rate service was also rendered obsolete by the 1980s due to intelligent network capability and technological improvement in the 800-service. A toll-free number may now terminate at a T-carrier line, at any standard local telephone number or at one of multiple destinations based on time of day, call origin, cost or other factors.

==Outbound WATS==
For Outbound WATS, the United States was divided into geographical Bands 0 through 5. Band zero was intrastate calling and bands 1 through 5 (or 6) were interstate calls that were progressively further from the originating number. Historically, the higher band number carried a higher price per month or per minute. These lines could be used for outbound long-distance only; not local. In the U.S., interstate WATS lines could not be used for intrastate calls, and vice versa. With wider availability of inexpensive long distance using regular business lines, OutWATS service became obsolete late in the 20th century.

==InWATS==

A form of toll-free telephone service in North America was the Zenith number, published in distant cities from where a company expected or desired frequent customer calls. Published as &quot;Zenith&quot; and a four- or five-digit number, these collect calls required operator assistance. The subscriber of the service was charged for the call.

With &quot;inward WATS&quot;, introduced for interstate calls by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) in 1967, subscribers were issued a toll-free telephone number in a designated toll-free area code. Unlike a standard collect call or a call to a Zenith number, 1800 normally may be dialed directly with no live operator. Callers within a designated area could call without incurring a toll charge as the recipient paid for the calls at a fixed rate.

The introduction of InWATS fortuitously fell around the same time as the early centralized, automated national airline and hotel reservation systems, including Sabre (American Airlines, 1963), Holidex (Holiday Inn, 1965) and Reservatron (Sheraton, 1969). Hundreds of local reservation numbers for a major chain could be replaced with one central number, backed by a national computerized reservation system.

InWATS exchanges were assigned to Canada and other North American Numbering Plan countries, but the original InWATS in each country accepted domestic calls only. Initially 1800NN2XXXX numbers were U.S. intrastate and specific prefixes (such as 1800387 Toronto and 1800267 Ottawa) were assigned to Canada. In the 1970s, AT&amp;T&#x27;s internal routing guides included separate U.S. and Canadian 1-800 exchange maps which looked much like area code maps as each geographic area code had one or more specific freephone exchange prefixes. Sheraton&#x27;s 8003253535, one of the notable early adopters in late 1969, was hard-wired into St. Louis area code 314; 1800HOLIDAY at that time could not be a U.S. number if the 1800465 prefix was hard-wired to Thunder Bay&#x27;s area code 807. Any attempt to call a foreign 1800 gave a pre-recorded error, &quot;the number you have dialed is not available from your calling area.&quot;

Like the OutWATS service, AT&amp;T&#x27;s InWATS was divided into intrastate and interstate, with interstate calls priced into five or six &quot;bands&quot; of calling. This favored placement of US national call centers in low-population Midwestern states such as Nebraska, whose central location meant a carefully situated &quot;band 3&quot; number reaching halfway across the US in every direction could potentially reach 47 states. A San Diego call center would be less fortunate; even with &quot;band 6&quot; (the most expensive lines), its national number would be unreachable to millions as California is a populous state and intrastate calls needed a separate toll-free number.

The original InWATS system was supplanted by &quot;Advanced 800 Service&quot; in the 1980s. Modern systems eliminated requirements tying toll-free numbers to dedicated flat-rate inbound WATS lines. Direct inward dial, introduced in 1983, allowed one trunk to carry calls for multiple numbers. AT&amp;T&#x27;s monopoly on U.S. toll-free number routing ended in 1986, encouraging flexibility in order to match rivals Sprint and MCI. By 1989, fixed &quot;bands&quot; of coverage area had been largely replaced by distance-based billing, a growing number of 1800 numbers were being terminated at standard local business or residence lines and one number could be sent to multiple locations based on call origin, least-cost routing or time of day routing. RespOrgs were established in the U.S. in 1993 and Canada in 1994 to provide toll free number portability using the Service Management System (SMS/800) database. Calls from Canada and the U.S., intrastate and interstate, could terminate at the same 1800 number, even via different carriers. Vanity numbers became easier to obtain as a toll-free exchange prefix was no longer tied to a geographic location. By the 21st century, Voice over IP placed toll-free and foreign exchange numbers into the hands of even the smallest users, to whom dedicated inbound lines under the original InWATS model would have been prohibitively expensive.

==Civil Rights Movement==
During the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S., activist organizations such as SNCC used WATS as a convenient way for eyewitnesses on the ground to convey information quickly. Notes from these phone calls were compiled into &quot;WATS Line Reports&quot; and mailed to civil rights leaders, the media, the Justice Department, and others involved in the events. WATS was also how organizations communicated with local leaders across the country. A &quot;Bay Area Friends of SNCC&quot; newsletter in 1965 described WATS:
The WATS (Wide Area Telephone Service) line is the heart of all SNCC security and communications. For a flat monthly rate, an unlimited number of calls can be dialed directly to any place in the country — or the state — depending on what line one uses. The Jackson office has a state-wide line, the Atlanta office has the national WATS line. Both run on a 24-hour basis. A project worker can call in news of any incident, threat or major activity to the Jackson office. The WATS operator there takes down the details and relays it to Atlanta if the event is of national importance. In the case of a threat or incident involving Federal laws, Jackson will notify the FBI and the Justice Department. Atlanta uses its national WATS line to notify SNCC groups around the country.

<doc id="41869" wikidata="Q283679" url="?curid=41869" title="Wildcard character">
<text>In software, a wildcard character is a kind of placeholder represented by a single character, such as an asterisk (), which can be interpreted as a number of literal characters or an empty string. It is often used in file searches so the full name need not be typed.

==Telecommunication==
In telecommunications, a wildcard is a character that may be substituted for any of a defined subset of all possible characters.

* In high-frequency (HF) radio automatic link establishment, the wildcard character may be substituted for any one of the 36 upper-case alphanumeric characters.
* Whether the wildcard character represents a single character or a string of characters must be specified.

==Computing==
In computer (software) technology, a wildcard is a symbol used to replace or represent zero or more characters. Algorithms for matching wildcards have been developed in a number of recursive and non-recursive varieties.

===File and directory patterns===
When specifying file names (or paths) in CP/M, DOS, Microsoft Windows, and Unix-like operating systems, the asterisk character (, also called &quot;star&quot;) matches zero or more characters. For example, matches and but not . If files are named with a date stamp, wildcards can be used to match date ranges, such as codice_1 to select video recordings from , to facilitate file operations such as copying and moving.

In Unix-like and DOS operating systems, the question mark matches exactly one character. In DOS, if the question mark is placed at the end of the word, it will also match missing (zero) trailing characters; for example, the pattern will match and , but not .

In Unix shells and Windows PowerShell, ranges of characters enclosed in square brackets ( and ) match a single character within the set; for example, matches any single uppercase or lowercase letter. In Unix shells, a leading exclamation mark negates the set and matches only a character not within the list. In shells that interpret as a history substitution, a leading caret can be used instead.

The operation of matching of wildcard patterns to multiple file or path names is referred to as &quot;globbing&quot;.

===Databases===
In SQL, wildcard characters can be used in LIKE expressions; the percent sign matches zero or more characters, and underscore a single character. Transact-SQL also supports square brackets ( and ) to list sets and ranges of characters to match, a leading caret negates the set and matches only a character not within the list. In Microsoft Access, the asterisk sign matches zero or more characters, the question mark matches a single character, the number sign matches a single digit (0–9), and square brackets can be used for sets or ranges of characters to match.

===Regular expressions===
In regular expressions, the period (, also called &quot;dot&quot;) is the wildcard pattern which matches any single character. Followed by the Kleene star operator, which is denoted as an asterisk (), we obtain , which will match zero or more arbitrary characters.

<text>Winking is a telephony signalling technique used both in connection with DC signalling on a trunk, and with indicator lamps on a key telephone.

In telephone switching systems, wink pulsing is recurring pulsing in which the &quot;off&quot; condition is relatively short compared to the &quot;on&quot; condition. In wink start trunks, the exchange at the originating seizes the trunk for an outgoing call. The terminating end indicates readiness to receive the dialled telephone number by sending an off-hook (current reversal) of approximately half a second duration, or &quot;wink&quot;. Upon receiving this &quot;go ahead&quot; signal, the originating end uses multi-frequency, DTMF, or dial pulse signalling to send the phone number.

On 1A2 key systems or similar key-operated telephone instruments, the hold position, &quot;i.e.,&quot; the hold condition, of a line is often indicated by winking the associated lamp at 120 impulses per minute. During 6% of the pulse period the lamp is off and 94% of the period the lamp is on, &quot;i.e.,&quot; 30 ms (milliseconds) off and 470 ms on.

<text>[[Wireless]] mobility management in Personal Communications Service (PCS) is the assigning and controlling of wireless links for terminal network connections. Wireless mobility management provides an &quot;alerting&quot; function for call completion to a wireless terminal, monitors wireless link performance to determine when an automatic link transfer is required, and coordinates link transfers between wireless access interfaces.

One use of this is wireless push technology, by pushing data across wireless networks, this coordinates the link transfers and pushes data between the backend and wireless device only when an established connection is found.

<doc id="41877" wikidata="Q8069441" url="?curid=41877" title="Zero-dispersion wavelength">
<text>In a single-mode optical fiber, the zero-dispersion wavelength is the wavelength or wavelengths at which material dispersion and waveguide dispersion cancel one another. In all silica-based optical fibers, minimum material dispersion occurs naturally at a wavelength of approximately 1300 nm. Single-mode fibers may be made of silica-based glasses containing dopants that shift the material-dispersion wavelength, and thus, the zero-dispersion wavelength, toward the minimum-loss window at approximately 1550 nm. The engineering tradeoff is a slight increase in the minimum attenuation coefficient. Such fiber is called dispersion-shifted fiber.

Another way to alter the dispersion is changing the core size and the refractive indices of the material of core and cladding. Because fiber optic materials are already highly optimized for low scattering and high transparency alternative ways to change the refractive index were investigated. As a straightforward solution tapered fibers and holey fibers or photonic crystal fibers (PCF) were produced. Essentially they replace the cladding by air. This improves the contrast of refractive indices by a factor of 10. Therefore, the effective index is changed, especially for longer wavelengths. This type of refractive index change versus wavelength due to different geometry is called waveguide dispersion.
As these narrow waveguides (~1-3 μm core diameter) are combined with ultrashort pulses at the zero-dispersion wavelength pulses are not instantly destroyed by dispersion. After reaching a certain peak power within the pulse the non-linear refractive index starts to play an important role leading to frequency generation processes like self-phase modulation (SPM), modulational instability, soliton generation and soliton fission, cross phase modulation (XPM) and others. All these processes generate new frequency components, meaning that input light with narrow bandwidth expands into a wide range of new colours, through a process called supercontinuum generation.

The term is also used, more loosely, in multi-mode optical fiber. There, it refers to the wavelength at which the material dispersion is minimum, &quot;i.e.&quot; &quot;essentially&quot; zero. This is more accurately called the minimum-dispersion wavelength.

==Zero-dispersion slope==
The rate of change of dispersion with respect to wavelength at the zero-dispersion point is called the zero-dispersion slope. Doubly and quadruply clad single-mode fibers have two zero-dispersion points.

<text>Zip-cord is a type of electrical cable with two or more conductors held together by an insulating jacket that can be easily separated simply by pulling apart. In Australia it is known as &#x27;figure-8&#x27; cable. The zip-cord term is also used with optical fiber cables consisting of two optical fibers joined in a similar manner. The design of zip-cord makes it easy to keep conductors that carry related electrical or optical signals together and helps avoid tangling of cables. Typical uses include lamp cord and speaker wire. Conductors may be identified by a color tracer on the insulation, or by a ridge molded into the insulation of one wire, or by a colored tracer thread inside the insulation. Zip cords are intended for use on portable equipment, and the US and Canadian electrical codes do not permit their use for permanently installed wiring of line-voltage circuits.

<doc id="41879" wikidata="Q213250" url="?curid=41879" title="Absolute pitch">
<text>Absolute pitch (AP), often called perfect pitch, is the ability to identify or re-create a given musical note without the benefit of a reference tone. AP may be demonstrated using linguistic labelling (&quot;naming&quot; a note), associating mental imagery with the note, or sensorimotor responses. For example, an AP possessor can accurately reproduce a heard tone on a musical instrument without &quot;hunting&quot; for the correct pitch.

== About ==
The frequency of AP in the general population is not known. A proportion of 1 in 10,000 is widely reported, but not supported by evidence; a 2019 review indicated a prevalence of at least 4% amongst music students.

Generally, absolute pitch implies some or all of these abilities, achieved without a reference tone:
* Identify by name individual pitches played on various instruments.
* Name the key of a given piece of tonal music.
* Identify and name all the tones of a given chord or other tonal mass.
* Name the pitches of common everyday sounds such as car horns and alarms.

Absolute pitch is distinct from relative pitch. While the ability to name specific pitches can be used to infer intervals, relative pitch identifies an interval directly by its sound. Absolute pitch may complement relative pitch in musical listening and practice, but it may also influence its development.

Adults who possess relative pitch but do not already have absolute pitch can learn &quot;pseudo-absolute pitch&quot; and become able to identify notes in a way that superficially resembles absolute pitch. Some people have been able to develop accurate pitch identification in adulthood through training.

==Scientific studies==

===History of study and terminologies===
Scientific studies of absolute pitch commenced in the 19th century, focusing on the phenomenon of musical pitch and methods of measuring it. It would have been difficult for the notion of absolute pitch to have formed earlier because pitch references were not consistent. For example, the note known as &#x27;A&#x27; varied in different local or national musical traditions between what is considered as G sharp and B flat before the standardisation of the late 19th century. While the term &quot;absolute pitch&quot;, or &quot;absolute ear&quot;, was in use by the late 19th century by both British and German researchers, its application was not universal; other terms such as &quot;musical ear&quot;, &quot;absolute tone consciousness&quot;, or &quot;positive pitch&quot; referred to the same ability. The skill is not exclusively musical.

===Difference in cognition, not elementary sensation===
Physically and functionally, the auditory system of an absolute listener evidently does not differ from that of a non-absolute listener. Rather, &quot;it reflects a particular ability to analyze frequency information, presumably involving high-level cortical processing.&quot; Absolute pitch is an act of cognition, needing memory of the frequency, a label for the frequency (such as &quot;B-flat&quot;), and exposure to the range of sound encompassed by that categorical label. Absolute pitch may be directly analogous to recognizing colors, phonemes (speech sounds), or other categorical perception of sensory stimuli. For example, most people have learned to recognize and name the color &quot;blue&quot; by the range of frequencies of the electromagnetic radiation that are perceived as light; those who have been exposed to musical notes together with their names early in life may be more likely to identify the note C. Although it was once thought that it &quot;might be nothing more than a general human capacity whose expression is strongly biased by the level and type of exposure to music that people experience in a given culture&quot;, absolute pitch may be influenced by genetic variation, possibly an autosomal dominant genetic trait.

===Influence by music experience===
Evidence suggests that absolute pitch sense is influenced by cultural exposure to music, especially in the familiarization of the equal-tempered C-major scale. Most of the absolute listeners that were tested in this respect identified the C-major tones more reliably and, except for B, more quickly than the five &quot;black key&quot; tones, which corresponds to the higher prevalence of these tones in ordinary musical experiences. One study of Dutch non-musicians also demonstrated a bias toward using C-major tones in ordinary speech, especially on syllables related to emphasis.

===Linguistics===
Absolute pitch is more common among speakers of tonal languages, such as most dialects of Chinese or Vietnamese, which depend on pitch variation to distinguish words that otherwise sound the same—e.g., Mandarin with four possible tonal variations, Cantonese with nine, Southern Min with seven or eight (depending on dialect), and Vietnamese with six. Speakers of Sino-Tibetan languages have been reported to speak a word in the same absolute pitch (within a quarter-tone) on different days; it has therefore been suggested that absolute pitch may be acquired by infants when they learn to speak a tonal language (and possibly also by infants when they learn to speak a pitch-accent language). However, the brains of tonal-language speakers do not naturally process musical sound as language; such speakers may be more likely to acquire absolute pitch for musical tones when they later receive musical training. Many native speakers of a tone language, even those with little musical training, are observed to sing a given song with consistent pitch. Among music students of East Asian ethnic heritage, those who speak a tone language fluently have a higher prevalence of absolute pitch than those who do not speak a tone language.

African level-tone languages—such as Yoruba, with three pitch levels, and Mambila, with four—may be better suited to study the role of absolute pitch in speech than the pitch and contour tone languages of East Asia.

Speakers of European languages make subconscious use of an absolute pitch memory when speaking.

===Perception===
Absolute pitch is the ability to perceive pitch class and to mentally categorize sounds according to perceived pitch class. A pitch class is the set of all pitches that are a whole number of octaves apart. While the boundaries of musical pitch categories vary among human cultures, the recognition of octave relationships is a natural characteristic of the mammalian auditory system. Accordingly, absolute pitch is not the ability to estimate a pitch value from the dimension of pitch-evoking frequency (30–5000 Hz), but to identify a pitch class category within the dimension of pitch class (e.g., C-C-D ... B-C).

An absolute listener&#x27;s sense of hearing is typically no keener than that of a non-absolute (&quot;normal&quot;) listener. Absolute pitch does not depend upon a refined ability to perceive and discriminate gradations of sound frequencies, but upon detecting and categorizing a subjective perceptual quality typically referred to as &quot;chroma&quot;. The two tasks— of identification (recognizing and naming a pitch) and discrimination (detecting changes or differences in rate of vibration)— are accomplished with different brain mechanisms.

===Special populations===
The prevalence of absolute pitch is higher among those who are blind from birth as a result of optic nerve hypoplasia.

Absolute pitch is considerably more common among those whose early childhood was spent in East Asia. This might seem to be a genetic difference; however, people of East Asian ancestry who are reared in North America are significantly less likely to develop absolute pitch than those raised in East Asia, so the difference is more probably explained by experience. The language that is spoken may be an important factor; many East Asians speak tonal languages such as Mandarin, Cantonese, and Thai, while others (such as those in Japan and certain provinces of Korea) speak pitch-accent languages, and the prevalence of absolute pitch may be partly explained by exposure to pitches together with meaningful musical labels very early in life.

Absolute pitch ability has higher prevalence among those with Williams syndrome and those with an autism spectrum disorder, with claims estimating that up to 30% of autistic people have absolute pitch. A non-verbal piano-matching method resulted in a correlation of 97% between autism and absolute pitch, with a 53% correlation in non-autistic observers. However, the converse is not indicated by research which found no difference between those with absolute pitch and those without on measures of social and communication skills, which are core deficits in autistic spectrum disorders. Additionally, the absolute pitch group&#x27;s autism-spectrum quotient was &quot;way below clinical thresholds&quot;.

===Nature vs. nurture===
Absolute pitch might be achievable by any human being during a critical period of auditory development, after which period cognitive strategies favor global and relational processing. Proponents of the critical-period theory agree that the presence of absolute pitch ability is dependent on learning, but there is disagreement about whether training causes absolute skills to occur or lack of training causes absolute perception to be overwhelmed and obliterated by relative perception of musical intervals.

One or more genetic loci could affect absolute pitch ability, a predisposition for learning the ability or signal the likelihood of its spontaneous occurrence.

Researchers have been trying to teach absolute pitch ability in laboratory settings for more than a century, and various commercial absolute-pitch training courses have been offered to the public since the early 1900s. In 2013, experimenters reported that adult men who took the antiseizure drug valproate (VPA) &quot;learned to identify pitch significantly better than those taking placebo—evidence that VPA facilitated critical-period learning in the adult human brain&quot;. However, no adult has ever been documented to have acquired absolute listening ability, because all adults who have been formally tested after AP training have failed to demonstrate &quot;an unqualified level of accuracy... comparable to that of AP possessors&quot;.

===Pitch memory related to musical context===

While very few people have the ability to name a pitch with no external reference, pitch memory can be activated by repeated exposure. People who are not skilled singers will often sing popular songs in the correct key, and can usually recognize when TV themes have been shifted into the wrong key. Members of the Venda culture in South Africa also sing familiar children&#x27;s songs in the key in which the songs were learned.

This phenomenon is apparently unrelated to musical training. The skill may be associated more closely with vocal production. Violin students learning the Suzuki method are required to memorize each composition in a fixed key and play it from memory on their instrument, but they are not required to sing. When tested, these students did not succeed in singing the memorized Suzuki songs in the original, fixed key.

===Possible problems===
Musicians with absolute perception may experience difficulties that do not exist for other musicians. Because absolute listeners are capable of recognizing that a musical composition has been transposed from its original key, or that a pitch is being produced at a nonstandard frequency (either sharp or flat), a musician with absolute pitch may become confused upon perceiving tones believed to be &quot;wrong&quot; or hearing a piece of music &quot;in the wrong key&quot;. The relative pitch of the notes may be in tune to each other, but out of tune to the standard pitch or pitches the musician is familiar with or perceives as correct. This can especially apply to Baroque music, as many Baroque orchestras tune to A = 415 Hz as opposed to 440 Hz (i.e., roughly one standard semitone lower than the ISO standard for concert A), while other recordings of Baroque pieces (especially those of French Baroque music) are performed at 392 Hz. Historically, tuning forks for concert A used on keyboard instruments (which ensembles tune to when present), have varied widely in frequency, often between 415 Hz to 456.7 Hz.

Variances in the sizes of intervals for different keys and the method of tuning instruments also can affect musicians in their perception of correct pitch, especially with music synthesized digitally using alternative tunings (e.g., unequal well temperaments and alternative meantone tunings such as 19-tone equal temperament and 31-tone equal temperament) as opposed to 12-tone equal temperament. An absolute listener may also use absolute strategies for tasks that are more efficiently accomplished with relative strategies, such as transposition or producing harmony that is microtonal or whose frequencies do not match standard 12-tone equal temperament. It is also possible for some musicians to have displaced absolute pitch, where all notes are slightly flat or slightly sharp of their respective pitch as defined by a given convention. This may arise from learning the pitch names from an instrument that was tuned to a concert pitch convention other than the one in use (e.g., A = 435 Hz, the Paris Opera convention of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as opposed to the modern Euro-American convention for concert A = 440 Hz). Concert pitches have shifted higher for a brighter sound. When playing in groups with other musicians, this may lead to playing in a tonality that is slightly different from that of the rest of the group, such as when soloists tune slightly sharp of the rest of the ensemble to stand out or to compensate for loosening strings during longer performances.

===Synesthesia===
Absolute pitch shows a genetic overlap with music-related and non-music-related synesthesia/ideasthesia. They may associate certain notes or keys with different colors, enabling them to tell what any note or key is. In this study, about 20% of people with absolute pitch are also synesthetes.

==Correlations==
There is evidence of a higher rate of absolute pitch in the autistic population. Many studies have examined pitch abilities in autism, but not rigidly perfect pitch, which makes them controversial. It is unclear just how many autistic people have perfect pitch because of this. In a 2009 study, researchers studied 72 autistic teenagers and found that 20 percent of the teenagers had a significant ability to detect pitches. Autistic children are especially sensitive to changes in pitch.

=== Correlation with musical talent ===
Absolute pitch is not a prerequisite for skilled musical performance or composition. However, there is evidence that musicians with absolute pitch tend to perform better on musical transcription tasks (controlling for age of onset and amount of musical training) compared to those without absolute pitch. It was previously argued that musicians with absolute pitch perform worse than those without absolute pitch on recognition of musical intervals; however, experiments on which this conclusion was based contained an artifact and, when this artifact was removed, absolute pitch possessors were found to perform better than nonpossessors on recognition of musical intervals.

<doc id="41881" wikidata="Q200299" url="?curid=41881" title="All About Eve">
<text>All About Eve is a 1950 American drama film written and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and produced by Darryl F. Zanuck. It is based on the 1946 short story (and subsequent 1949 radio drama) &quot;The Wisdom of Eve&quot; by Mary Orr, although Orr does not receive a screen credit.

The film stars Bette Davis as Margo Channing, a highly regarded but aging Broadway star, and Anne Baxter as Eve Harrington, an ambitious young fan who maneuvers herself into Channing&#x27;s life, ultimately threatening Channing&#x27;s career and her personal relationships. The film co-stars George Sanders, Celeste Holm, Gary Merrill, and Hugh Marlowe, and features Thelma Ritter, Marilyn Monroe in one of her earliest roles, Gregory Ratoff, Barbara Bates and Walter Hampden.

&quot;All About Eve&quot; held its world premiere in New York City on October 13, 1950. Highly praised by critics at the time of its release, it received a record 14 nominations at the 23rd Academy Awards, becoming the only film in Oscar history to receive four female acting nominations (Davis and Baxter as Best Actress, Holm and Ritter as Best Supporting Actress). It went on to win six awards, including Best Picture, as well as Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, Mankiewicz&#x27;s second consecutive wins in both categories.

Widely considered as among the greatest films of all time, in 1990, &quot;All About Eve&quot; became one of 25 films selected for preservation in the United States Library of Congress&#x27;s National Film Registry, deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film was ranked No. 16 on AFI&#x27;s 1998 list of the 100 best American films.

==Plot==
The story begins in medias res, told via narration by acerbic theatre critic Addison DeWitt, who introduces the various characters as they attend the ceremony for the distinguished Sarah Siddons Award for Prestigious Achievement, awarded to rising star actor Eve Harrington. DeWitt&#x27;s narration promises the audience will learn Eve&#x27;s true story as the narrative voice switches to that of Karen Richards.

Some years previous, Broadway star Margo Channing, recently turned 40, worries about what advancing age will mean for her career. After a performance of Margo&#x27;s latest play, Margo&#x27;s close friend, Karen Richards, wife of the play&#x27;s author Lloyd Richards, brings besotted fan Eve Harrington backstage to meet Margo. In Margo&#x27;s dressing room, Eve tells Karen, Lloyd, and Margo&#x27;s maid Birdie, that she followed Margo&#x27;s last theatrical tour to New York City after seeing her perform in San Francisco. She tells an engrossing story of growing up poor in Wisconsin and losing her young husband, Eddie, in the South Pacific during World War II. Moved by Eve&#x27;s story, Margo takes her into her home as her assistant, upsetting Birdie. Eve quickly manipulates her way into Margo&#x27;s life, acting as both secretary and adoring fan.

Adding to Margo&#x27;s concerns about aging is her romantic relationship with the play&#x27;s director, Bill Sampson, 8 years her junior. Without telling Margo, Eve arranges a midnight, long-distance phone call from Margo to Bill on his birthday while he is in California, directing a film. Eve hopes the unexpected call will show Bill that Margo had forgotten his birthday, and Eve even sends her own greetings. However, Margo grows suspicious, realizes that Eve set her up, and manages to conceal her surprise and confusion. Wanting to get Eve away from Bill, Margo asks producer Max Fabian to hire Eve at his office; instead, Eve becomes Margo&#x27;s understudy without Margo&#x27;s knowledge.

As Margo&#x27;s irritation grows, Karen sympathizes with Eve, believing that Margo is overdramatizing her resentment of Eve out of temperamental peevishness. Hoping to humble Margo, Karen conspires for her to miss a performance so that Eve can perform. Eve invites the city&#x27;s theater critics to attend the performance—including the influential DeWitt. Eve&#x27;s performance is a triumph. Later that night, Eve attempts to seduce Bill, who as a successful Broadway producer might be useful to her career. Bill rejects Eve, letting her know that he sees her manipulations. Instead, Addison takes an interest in Eve. He interviews her for a column, harshly criticizing Margo for resisting younger talent.

Margo and Bill announce their engagement at dinner with Lloyd and Karen. Eve summons Karen to the ladies&#x27; room and, after first appearing regretful, delivers an ultimatum: Karen must recommend her to Lloyd to play Cora, the lead role in Lloyd&#x27;s new play. Otherwise, she will reveal Karen&#x27;s part in Margo&#x27;s missed performance. When Karen returns to the table—to her relief—Margo surprisingly announces that she does not wish to play Cora, saying she is too old for the ingénue role. Intimating that the prospect of marriage to Bill has changed her perspective, Margo denounces Eve but also revels in no longer being captive to the artifices of a system that would readily exchange her for someone younger, forcing her always to chase a glamorized ideal of beauty, youthfulness, and success.

Eve is cast as Cora. Just before the new play&#x27;s premiere in New Haven, Eve reveals her next plan to Addison: to marry Lloyd—whom she has seduced despite his wife Karen&#x27;s championship of her—so that Lloyd can write plays in which for her to star. Angered with Eve&#x27;s audacity, Addison says he knows her backstory is entirely lies; her real name is Gertrude Slescynski, she was never married, and she was paid to leave town over an affair with her married boss. He also says Lloyd would never leave Karen for Eve. Addison then blackmails Eve, saying she now &quot;belongs&quot; to him.

The story catches up to the opening scene; months later, Eve is a Broadway star headed for Hollywood. While accepting the Sarah Siddons Award, she thanks Margo, Bill, Lloyd, and Karen as all four coldly stare back. Eve skips the after-party and returns home, where she encounters Phoebe, a teenage fan who slipped into her apartment and fell asleep. Phoebe professes her adoration and ingratiates herself with Eve, then begins packing her trunk. Eve invites her to stay over rather than take the long subway ride back to Brooklyn. While Eve is resting, Addison brings Eve&#x27;s forgotten award to the door and is greeted by Phoebe, who admits she chose her own theatrical name. Addison realizes Phoebe will do to Eve what Eve did to Margo. When she is alone, Phoebe puts on Eve&#x27;s elegant cloak and poses in front of a floor-length mirror, holding the award and bowing.

==Production==
===Development===
The story of &quot;All About Eve&quot; originated in an anecdote related to Mary Orr by actress Elisabeth Bergner. While performing in &quot;The Two Mrs. Carrolls&quot; during 1943 and 1944, Bergner allowed a young fan to become part of her household and employed her as an assistant, but later regretted her generosity when the woman attempted to undermine her. Referring to her only as &quot;the terrible girl&quot;, Bergner related the events to Orr, who used it as the basis for her short story &quot;The Wisdom of Eve&quot; (1946). In the story, Orr gives the girl an even more ruthless character and allows her to succeed in stealing the older actress&#x27;s career and the husband of the unnamed female narrator. Bergner later confirmed the basis of the story in her autobiography &quot;Bewundert viel, und viel gescholten&quot; (&quot;Greatly Admired and Greatly Scolded&quot;).

In 1949, Joseph Mankiewicz was considering a story about an aging actress and, upon reading &quot;The Wisdom of Eve,&quot; felt that the conniving girl would be a useful element. He sent a memo to Darryl F. Zanuck saying it &quot;fits in with an original idea [of mine] and can be combined. Superb starring role for Susan Hayward.&quot; Mankiewicz presented a film treatment of the combined stories under the title &quot;Best Performance.&quot; He changed the main character&#x27;s name from Margola Cranston to Margo Channing and retained several of Orr&#x27;s characters – Eve Harrington, Lloyd and Karen Richards and Miss Casswell – while removing Margo&#x27;s husband completely and replacing him with a new character, Bill Sampson. The intention was to depict Margo in a new relationship and allow Eve to threaten Margo&#x27;s professional and personal lives. Mankiewicz also added the characters Addison DeWitt, Birdie Coonan, Max Fabian and Phoebe.

Zanuck was enthusiastic and provided numerous suggestions for improving the screenplay. In some sections, he felt that Mankiewicz&#x27;s writing lacked subtlety or provided excessive detail. He suggested diluting Birdie Coonan&#x27;s mistrust of Eve so the audience would not recognize Eve as a villainess until much later in the story. Zanuck reduced the screenplay by about 50 pages and chose the title &quot;All About Eve&quot; from the opening scene in which Addison DeWitt says that he will soon tell &quot;more of Eve ... All about Eve, in fact.&quot;

===Casting===
Among the actresses originally considered to play Margo Channing were Mankiewicz&#x27;s original inspiration Susan Hayward, who was rejected by Zanuck as &quot;too young&quot;, Marlene Dietrich, dismissed as &quot;too German&quot; and Gertrude Lawrence, who was ruled out when her lawyer insisted that she not have to drink or smoke in the film and that the script would be rewritten to allow her to sing a torch song. Zanuck favored Barbara Stanwyck, but she was not available. Tallulah Bankhead was considered, as was Joan Crawford, who was working on the film &quot;The Damned Don&#x27;t Cry.&quot;

The role went to Claudette Colbert, but she withdrew after an injury shortly before filming began. Mankiewicz briefly considered Ingrid Bergman before offering the role to Bette Davis. Davis, who had recently ended an 18-year association with Warner Bros. after several poorly received films, accepted the role, saying later that the script was among the best that she had ever read. Margo had been originally conceived as genteel and knowingly humorous, but with the casting of Davis, Mankiewicz revised the character to introduce abrasive qualities. Mankiewicz praised Davis for her professionalism and for the caliber of her performance.

Anne Baxter had spent a decade in supporting roles and had won the 1946 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge.&quot; She won the role of Eve after Jeanne Crain, the first choice, became pregnant. Crain was at the height of her popularity and had established a career playing likable heroines; Zanuck believed that she lacked the &quot;bitch virtuosity&quot; required by the part and that audiences would not accept her as a deceitful character.

Mankiewicz greatly admired Thelma Ritter and wrote the character of Birdie Coonan for her after working with her on &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot; in 1949. As Coonan is the only character immediately suspicious of Eve Harrington, Mankiewicz was confident that Ritter would contribute a shrewd characterization that cast doubt on Eve and provided a counterpoint to the more theatrical personalities of the other characters. Marilyn Monroe, relatively unknown at the time, was cast as Miss Casswell, referred to by DeWitt as a &quot;graduate of the Copacabana School of Dramatic Art.&quot;

Monroe won the part after a lobbying campaign by her agent, despite Zanuck&#x27;s initial antipathy and belief that she was better suited to comedy. The inexperienced Monroe was cowed by Davis, and it took 11 takes to complete the scene in the theater lobby; when Davis barked at her, Monroe left the set to vomit. Smaller roles were filled by Gregory Ratoff as the producer Max Fabian, Barbara Bates as Phoebe and Walter Hampden as the host of the award ceremony. Hampden was the president of the prestigious Players Club in New York, a club for actors that gives a lifetime achievement award.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film earned $3.1 million in receipts in the United States during its release, more than double its original budget of $1.4 million. the film had a cumulative gross of $8.4 million, more than five times its production costs.

===Critical response===
&quot;All About Eve&quot; received widespread critical acclaim upon its release on October 13, 1950, at a New York City premiere. The film&#x27;s competitor, &quot;Sunset Boulevard,&quot; released the same year, drew similar praise, and the two were often favorably compared. Film critic Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; loved the picture, stating that &quot;a fine Darryl Zanuck production, excellent music and an air of ultra-class complete this superior satire.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a literate, adult film&quot; with &quot;exceedingly well-cast performances,&quot; while &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called it &quot;a fascinating, continually absorbing story about Broadway theatrical people, given a mature treatment and penetrated with realistic dialogue and flashes of slick, sardonic humor.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;a thoroughly entertaining movie.&quot;

Writing in 2000, film critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; praised the film, saying of Bette Davis that &quot;veteran actress Margo Channing in &quot;All About Eve&quot; was her greatest role.&quot; Boxoffice.com stated that it &quot;is a classic of the American cinema – to this day the quintessential depiction of ruthless ambition in the entertainment industry, with legendary performances from Bette Davis, Anne Baxter and George Sanders anchoring one of the very best films from one of Hollywood&#x27;s very best Golden Era filmmakers: Joseph L. Mankiewicz.&quot;

As of 2021 review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;All About Eve&quot; holds an approval rating of 99% based on 107 reviews, with an average rating of 9.30/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Smart, sophisticated, and devastatingly funny, &quot;All About Eve&quot; is a Hollywood classic that only improves with age.&quot; In 2019 Metacritic assigned a weighted average score of 98 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===Thematic content===
Critics and academics have delineated various themes in the film. Rebecca Flint Marx, in her &quot;Allmovie&quot; review, notes the antagonism that existed between Broadway and Hollywood at the time, stating that the &quot;script summoned into existence a whole array of painfully recognizable theatre types, from the aging, egomaniacal grand dame to the outwardly docile, inwardly scheming ingenue to the powerful critic who reeks of malignant charm.&quot; Abel Green, writing in &quot;Variety&quot; said, &quot;The snide references to picture people, the plug for San Francisco (&quot;an oasis of civilization in the California desert&quot;) and the like are purposeful and manifest an intelligent reflex from a group of hyper-talented people towards the picture business.&quot;

Roger Ebert, in his review in &quot;The Great Movies&quot;, says Eve Harrington is &quot;a universal type&quot;, and focuses on the aging actress plot line, comparing the film to &quot;Sunset Boulevard.&quot; Similarly, Marc Lee&#x27;s 2006 review of the film for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; describes a subtext &quot;into the darker corners of show business, exposing its inherent ageism, especially when it comes to female stars.&quot; Kathleen Woodward&#x27;s 1999 book, &quot;Figuring Age: Women, Bodies, Generations (Theories of Contemporary Culture)&quot;, also discusses themes that appeared in many of the &quot;aging actress&quot; films of the 1950s and 1960s, including &quot;All About Eve.&quot; She reasons that Margo has three options: &quot;To continue to work, she can perform the role of a young woman, one she no longer seems that interested in. She can take up the position of the angry bitch, the drama queen who holds court (the deliberate camp that Susan Sontag finds in this film). Or she can accept her culture&#x27;s gendered discourse of aging which figures her as in her moment of fading. Margo ultimately chooses the latter option, accepting her position as one of loss.&quot;

&quot;All About Eve&quot; has long been a favored film among gay audiences, likely due to its campy overtones (in part due to the casting of Davis) and its general sophistication. Davis, who long had a strong gay fan base, expressed support for gay men in her 1972 interview with &quot;The Advocate&quot;.

==Accolades==
===Later recognition and rankings===
In 1990, &quot;All About Eve&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;All About Eve&quot; in 2000. The film received in 1997 a placement on the Producers Guild of America Hall of Fame. The film has been selected by the American Film Institute for many of their 100 Years lists.

When AFI named Bette Davis #2 on its list of the greatest female American screen legends, &quot;All About Eve&quot; was the film selected to highlight Davis&#x27; legendary career. The Writers Guild of America has ranked the film&#x27;s screenplay as the fifth greatest ever written.

===Sarah Siddons Award===

The film opens with the image of a fictitious award trophy, described by DeWitt as the &quot;highest honor our theater knows: the Sarah Siddons Award for Distinguished Achievement.&quot; The statuette is modeled after the famous painting of Siddons costumed as the tragic Muse by Joshua Reynolds, a copy of which hangs in the entrance of Margo&#x27;s apartment and often visible during the party scene. In 1952, a small group of distinguished Chicago theater-goers began to give an award with that name, which was sculpted to look like the one used in the film. It has been given annually, with past honorees including Bette Davis and Celeste Holm.

==Adaptations==
The first radio adaptation was a one-hour broadcast on &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; on CBS Radio on October 1, 1951, with Bette Davis, Gary Merrill and Anne Baxter reprising their original roles. &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; did a follow-up adaptation on November 23, 1954, this time on NBC radio with Ann Blyth and Claire Trevor playing the lead roles, with Trevor replacing Ida Lupino when she became ill and was unable to attend the broadcast.

A radio version of &quot;All About Eve&quot; starring Tallulah Bankhead as Margo Channing was presented on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Big Show&quot; by the Theatre Guild of the Air on November 16, 1952. Bankhead and many contemporary critics felt that the characterization of Margo Channing was patterned on her, a long-rumored charge denied by both Mankiewicz and Davis, but attested by costume designer Edith Head. Additionally, Bankhead&#x27;s rivalry with her understudy (Lizabeth Scott) during the production of &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot; is cited as an alternative hypothesis for the origin of Mary Orr&#x27;s &quot;The Wisdom of Eve,&quot; the original short story that formed the basis for the film. Bette Davis played three roles on film that Tallulah Bankhead had originated&quot;Dark Victory&quot;, &quot;Jezebel&quot; and &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;, much to Bankhead&#x27;s chagrin. Bankhead and Davis were considered to be somewhat similar in style. Several decades later Davis called Channing &quot;the essence of a Tallulah Bankhead kind of actress&quot; in an interview with Barbara Walters. The production is notable in that Mary Orr, of &quot;The Wisdom of Eve,&quot; played the role of Karen Richards. The cast also featured Alan Hewitt as Addison DeWitt (who narrated), Beatrice Pearson as Eve Harrington, Don Briggs as Lloyd Richards, Kevin McCarthy as Bill Samson, Florence Robinson as Birdie Coonan, and Stefan Schnabel as Max Fabian.

In 1970, &quot;All About Eve&quot; was the inspiration for the stage musical &quot;Applause,&quot; with book by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, lyrics by Lee Adams, and music by Charles Strouse. The original production starred Lauren Bacall as Margo Channing, and it won the Tony Award for Best Musical that season. It ran for four previews and 896 performances at the Palace Theatre on Broadway. After Bacall left the production, she was replaced by Anne Baxter in the role of Margo Channing.

In 2019, a stage adaptation of &quot;All About Eve&quot; premiered at the Noël Coward Theatre in London, directed by Ivo van Hove and starring Gillian Anderson as Margo Channing, Julian Ovenden as Bill, and Lily James as Eve Harrington.

==In popular culture==
* The plot of the film has been used numerous times, frequently as an outright homage to the film, with one notable example being a 1974 episode of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; titled &quot;A New Sue Ann&quot;. In the episode, the character of Sue Ann Nivens (Betty White), hostess of a popular local cooking show, hires a young, pretty and very eager fan (Linda Kelsey) as her apprentice and assistant, but the neophyte quickly begins to sabotage her mentor, in an attempt to replace her as host of the show. Sue Ann, however, unlike Margo Channing, prevails in the end, countering the young woman&#x27;s attempts to steal her success and sending her on her way.
* Brazilian telenovela &quot;Celebridade&quot; was loosely based on &quot;All About Eve&quot; plot; it features Malu Mader as the successful businesswoman and former model Maria Clara Diniz, who hires Laura Prudente da Costa (Cláudia Abreu) for a job in her company after she saves her life and claims to be her greatest fan — but she is, in fact, an imposter who wants not only to take everything from the other woman, but to become a new Maria Clara.
* The English rock band All About Eve took their name from the film.
* Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;Magic Mike&quot; is a loose re-working of the &quot;All About Eve&quot; plot and includes subtle references in homage to the original. The lead actor Channing Tatum name checks Bette Davis&#x27;s character Margo Channing, and instead of Eve, the ambitious young upstart is named Adam, played by Alex Pettyfer. Like Eve, Adam gets his stage debut filling in for an absent star, and his subsequent ruthless rise to glory at the expense of others mirrors that of Eve.
* A 2008 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; titled &quot;All About Lisa&quot; is influenced by this film. In the episode, Lisa Simpson becomes Krusty the Clown&#x27;s assistant, eventually taking his place on television and receiving an entertainment award.
* Pedro Almodóvar&#x27;s 1999 Academy Award-winning Spanish-language film &quot;Todo sobre mi madre&quot; (&quot;All About My Mother&quot;) has elements similar to those found in &quot;All About Eve&quot;. The title of the film itself is an homage to the 1950 film.
* In the fifth season of &quot;The L Word&quot;, a fan becomes Jenny Schecter&#x27;s assistant while she is directing a movie; later the fan blackmails the movie studio into letting her direct and she proceeds to take over Jenny&#x27;s life.
* In the second season of &quot;Glee&quot;, Kurt Hummel calls his fellow glee club member Santana Lopez &quot;a Latina Eve Harrington&quot;, after learning she is blackmailing a closeted jock into becoming her &quot;beard&quot; and running mate for Prom Queen and King.
* In the first season of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, Grace becomes dependent on a maid to give her a confidence boost during a design competition. This prompts her drunken assistant Karen to suspect a plot and she confronts the maid, exclaiming &quot;I&#x27;ve seen &quot;All About Eve&quot;. Poooor Eve!&quot;
* In the pilot episode of &quot;Political Animals&quot;, when Susan suspects Georgia, a fellow reporter, has a crush on her boyfriend and is attempting to outshine her at the newspaper, she says, &quot;If Eve Harrington were an actual person today, she would look like Georgia. She would bake cupcakes, and she would have a blog.&quot;
* In the third season of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, the episode &quot;All About Eva&quot; concerns the character of Eva Grubb coming on the island and taking over Ginger&#x27;s persona, with both roles played by actress Tina Louise.
* In the fifth season of &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;, the plot of the episode &quot;Goodbye Norma Jean&quot; mirrors that of &quot;All About Eve&quot;. In it, Sam Beckett leaps into Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s chauffeur and finds himself pitted against an aspiring actress who is trying to steal Monroe&#x27;s part for the film &quot;The Misfits&quot;. Sam succeeds in stopping Monroe&#x27;s rival, and she rightfully takes her place as Clark Gable&#x27;s leading lady.
* In Alex Holdridge&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;In Search of a Midnight Kiss&quot;, Vivian, an amateur actress played by Sara Simmonds, says to Wilson, played by Scoot McNairy: &quot;I just don&#x27;t think people out here have the raw ambition that I do.&quot; And he replies: &quot;You are a real &quot;All About Eve&quot;.&quot;
* &quot;All About Steve&quot; is a 2009 American comedy film.
* A season 6 episode of &quot;Designing Women&quot; titled, &quot;All About Odes to Atlanta&quot;, sees Carlene, Mary Jo, and Julia entering a song contest and drawing the attention of a young &quot;fan&quot; who seems all too eager to help them, much to Allison&#x27;s distrust.
* The season 20 episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot; titled, &quot;All About Alana&quot;, is a homage to the film and sees Lois Griffin allowing one of her piano students Alana Fitzgerald to move in with the family, who begins slowly taking over Lois&#x27; life.
* The storyline was partially adapted in 2023 and 2024 by All Elite Wrestling, in which Mariah May was first portrayed as a super-fan, and later, protegé of &quot;Timeless&quot; Toni Storm – who was herself portraying gimmick based on &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; – before May&#x27;s transition to a more villainous character whose plan all along was to supplant Storm.

<text>MIL-STD-188 is a series of U.S. military standards relating to telecommunications.
==Purpose==
Faced with &quot;past technical deficiencies in telecommunications systems and equipment and software…that were traced to basic inadequacies in the application of telecommunication standards and to the lack of a well defined…program for their review, control and implementation&quot;, the U.S. Department of Defense looked to develop a series of standards that would alleviate the problem.

By 1988, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) issued Instruction 4630.8 (reissued in 1992, 2002, 2004) stating its policy that &quot;all forces for joint and combined operations be supported through compatible, interoperable, and integrated Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence systems. …[and that all such] systems developed for use by U.S. forces are considered to be for joint use.&quot; To achieve this the director of the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is charged with &quot;developing information technology standards to achieve interoperability and compatibility…[and ensure that all] systems and equipment shall conform to technical and procedural standards for interface, interoperability, and compatibility&quot;.

The MIL-STD-188 standards were created to &quot;address telecommunication design parameters based on proven technologies.&quot; To ensure interoperability, DISA made these standards mandatory for use in all new DoD systems and equipment, or major upgrades.

The mandatory use of these standards will aid significantly in achieving standardization and result in improvements in availability, maintainability, reliability, and supportability. This, in turn, will enhance lifecycle configuration management and logistic support with subsequent reductions in life cycle costs.

==Evolution==
When first developed, Military Standard 188 covered technical standards for tactical and long-haul communications, but as it was revised (MIL-STD-188A, MIL-STD-188B) it became a document applicable to tactical communications only (MIL-STD-188C 24 Nov 1969). The Defense Information Systems Agency published circulars which announced both standards and engineering criteria relating to the long-haul Defense Communications System and to the technical support of the Worldwide Military Command and Control System. In line with a decision by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, these standards are published in the MIL-STD-188 series of documents. This series is subdivided into &quot;a MIL-STD-188-100 series covering common standards for tactical and long-haul communications, a MIL-STD-188-200 series covering standards for tactical communications only, and a MIL-STD-188-300 series covering standards for long-haul communications only.&quot;

The MIL-STD-188 series standards are encompassed by the DoD&#x27;s Joint Technical Architecture.

==Deviations and waivers==
For any manufacturer seeking to deviate from the MIL–STD-188 series standards (prior to the manufacture of an item) they must request to do so with the Joint Steering Committee (JSC) which is constituted under the Defense Communications Agency. For any DoD Agency to get a waiver to receive an item that deviates from the standards they also must apply to the JSC.

==Relation to other systems of standards==
According to DoD documents, &quot;The MIL-STD-188 series may be based on, or make reference to, Joint Technical Architecture, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards, International Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) recommendations, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization Agreements (STANAG), and other standards wherever applicable.&quot;

==Current development emphasis==
Currently the DoD is placing its emphasis &quot;on the development of common standards for tactical and long-haul communications (the MIL-STD-188-100 series).&quot;

<doc id="41885" wikidata="Q1650" url="?curid=41885" title="Weser">
<text>The Weser () is a river of Lower Saxony in north-west Germany. It begins at Hannoversch Münden through the confluence of the Werra and Fulda. It passes through the Hanseatic city of Bremen. Its mouth is further north against the ports of Bremerhaven and Nordenham. The latter is on the Butjadingen Peninsula. It then merges into the North Sea via two highly saline, estuarine mouths.

It connects to the canal network running east–west across the North German Plain.

The river, when combined with the Werra (a dialectal form of &quot;Weser&quot;), is long and thus, the longest river entirely situated within Germany (the Main, however, is the longest if the Weser-Werra are considered separate). The Weser itself is long. The Werra rises in Thuringia, the German state south of the main projection (tongue) of Lower Saxony.

==Etymology==
&quot;Weser&quot; and &quot;Werra&quot; are the same words in different dialects. The difference reflects the old linguistic border between Central and Low German, passing through Hannoversch Münden.

The name likely derives from the Old Germanic &quot;*waisōn&quot; &quot;flow, ooze&quot;. It is cognate with the Wear in England and Vistula (Polish Wisła, German Weichsel) in Poland, all of which are derived from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;to flow&quot;, which also gives rise to Old English/Old Frisian &quot;wāse&quot; &quot;mud, ooze&quot;, Old Norse &quot;veisa&quot; &quot;slime, stagnant pool&quot;, Dutch &quot;waas&quot; &quot;haze; soggy land&quot; (see Waasland), Old Saxon &quot;waso&quot; &quot;wet ground, mire&quot;, Old High German &quot;wasal&quot; &quot;rain&quot; and French &quot;vase&quot; &quot;mud, sludge&quot;.

==Course==
The Weser starts at the confluence of the Fulda and the Werra. It then runs down to the Porta Westfalica between two high hill ranges, the Wiehengebirge, in the west and the Weserbergland in the east.

Between Minden and the North Sea, humans have largely canalised the river up to a limit of 1,200-ton ships. Eight hydroelectric dams stand at the ends of adjacent weirstreams that make up the river. The navigation is linked west to the Dortmund–Ems Canal via the Coastal Canal. It is linked east at Bremerhaven to the Elbe.

A large reservoir, the Edersee, on the Eder, the main tributary of the Fulda, is used to allow enough water depth for shipping year-round. The dam, built in 1914, was bombed and severely damaged by British aircraft in May 1943, causing great destruction and about 70 deaths downstream. It was rebuilt within four months. The reservoir is a major summer resort area. Turbines driven by its sluices provide electricity.

The Weser enters the North Sea in the southernmost part of the German Bight. In the sea it splits into two arms – the riverbed at the end of the last ice age. These sea arms are called &quot;Alte Weser&quot; (old Weser) and &quot;Neue Weser&quot; (new Weser). They are the waterways for ships heading for the ports of Bremerhaven, Nordenham, and Bremen. The Alte Weser Lighthouse marks the northernmost point of the Weser. This replaced the Roter Sand Lighthouse in 1964.

==Tributaries==
The largest tributary of the Weser is the Aller, which joins south of Bremen. Tributaries of the Weser and the Werra (from source to mouth) are:

Modes of the list:
* Listed upstream, but sides seen with the flow
* Distances (&quot;km …&quot;) from the hydrographical limit towards the sea
** &quot;II&quot;, &quot;III&quot;and &quot;IV&quot; mark distances of secondary/tertiary tributaries from the confluence with the Weser etc.
* After the names, lengths and basin sizes are given.

<text>Felix Christian Klein (; 25 April 1849 – 22 June 1925) was a German mathematician and mathematics educator, known for his work in group theory, complex analysis, non-Euclidean geometry, and the associations between geometry and group theory. His 1872 Erlangen program classified geometries by their basic symmetry groups and was an influential synthesis of much of the mathematics of the time.

During his tenure at the University of Göttingen, Klein was able to turn it into a center for mathematical and scientific research through the establishment of new lectures, professorships, and institutes. His seminars covered most areas of mathematics then known as well as their applications. Klein also devoted considerable time to mathematical instruction, and promoted mathematics education reform at all grade levels in Germany and abroad. He became the first president of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction in 1908 at the Fourth International Congress of Mathematicians in Rome.

==Life==

Felix Klein was born on 25 April 1849 in Düsseldorf, to Prussian parents. His father, Caspar Klein (1809–1889), was a Prussian government official&#x27;s secretary stationed in the Rhine Province. His mother was Sophie Elise Klein (1819–1890, née Kayser). He attended the Gymnasium in Düsseldorf, then studied mathematics and physics at the University of Bonn, 1865–1866, intending to become a physicist. At that time, Julius Plücker had Bonn&#x27;s professorship of mathematics and experimental physics, but by the time Klein became his assistant, in 1866, Plücker&#x27;s interest was mainly geometry. Klein received his doctorate, supervised by Plücker, from the University of Bonn in 1868.

Plücker died in 1868, leaving his book concerning the basis of line geometry incomplete. Klein was the obvious person to complete the second part of Plücker&#x27;s &quot;Neue Geometrie des Raumes&quot;, and thus became acquainted with Alfred Clebsch, who had relocated to Göttingen in 1868. Klein visited Clebsch the next year, along with visits to Berlin and Paris. In July 1870, at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War, he was in Paris and had to leave the country. For a brief time he served as a medical orderly in the Prussian army before being appointed &quot;Privatdozent&quot; (lecturer) at Göttingen in early 1871.

The University of Erlangen appointed Klein professor in 1872, when he was only 23 years old. For this, he was endorsed by Clebsch, who regarded him as likely to become the best mathematician of his time. Klein did not wish to remain in Erlangen, where there were very few students, and was pleased to be offered a professorship at the Technische Hochschule München in 1875. There he and Alexander von Brill taught advanced courses to many excellent students, including Adolf Hurwitz, Walther von Dyck, Karl Rohn, Carl Runge, Max Planck, Luigi Bianchi, and Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro.

In 1875, Klein married Anne Hegel, granddaughter of the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.

After spending five years at the Technische Hochschule, Klein was appointed to a chair of geometry at Leipzig University. His colleagues included Walther von Dyck, Rohn, Eduard Study and Friedrich Engel. Klein&#x27;s years at Leipzig, 1880 to 1886, fundamentally changed his life. In 1882, his health collapsed and he battled with depression for the next two years. Nevertheless, his research continued; his seminal work on hyperelliptic sigma functions, published between 1886 and 1888, dates from around this period.
Klein accepted a professorship at the University of Göttingen in 1886. From then on, until his 1913 retirement, he sought to re-establish Göttingen as the world&#x27;s prime center for mathematics research. However, he never managed to transfer from Leipzig to Göttingen his own leading role as developer of geometry. He taught a variety of courses at Göttingen, mainly concerning the interface between mathematics and physics, in particular, mechanics and potential theory.

The research facility Klein established at Göttingen served as model for the best such facilities throughout the world. He introduced weekly discussion meetings, and created a mathematical reading room and library. In 1895, Klein recruited David Hilbert from the University of Königsberg. This appointment proved of great importance; Hilbert continued to enhance Göttingen&#x27;s primacy in mathematics until his own retirement in 1932.

Under Klein&#x27;s editorship, &quot;Mathematische Annalen&quot; became one of the best mathematical journals in the world. Founded by Clebsch, it grew under Klein&#x27;s management, to rival, and eventually surpass &quot;Crelle&#x27;s Journal&quot;, based at the University of Berlin. Klein established a small team of editors who met regularly, making decisions in a democratic spirit. The journal first specialized in complex analysis, algebraic geometry, and invariant theory. It also provided an 
important outlet for real analysis and the new group theory.

In 1893, Klein was a major speaker at the International Mathematical Congress held in Chicago as part of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. Due partly to Klein&#x27;s efforts, Göttingen began admitting women in 1893. He supervised the first Ph.D. thesis in mathematics written at Göttingen by a woman, by Grace Chisholm Young, an English student of Arthur Cayley&#x27;s, whom Klein admired. In 1897, Klein became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Around 1900, Klein began to become interested in mathematical instruction in schools. In 1905, he was instrumental in formulating a plan recommending that analytic geometry, the rudiments of differential and integral calculus, and the function concept be taught in secondary schools. This recommendation was gradually implemented in many countries around the world. In 1908, Klein was elected president of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction at the Rome International Congress of Mathematicians. Under his guidance, the German part of the Commission published many volumes on the teaching of mathematics at all levels in Germany.

The London Mathematical Society awarded Klein its De Morgan Medal in 1893. He was elected a member of the Royal Society in 1885, and was awarded its Copley Medal in 1912. He retired the following year due to ill health, but continued to teach mathematics at his home for several further years.

Klein was one of ninety-three signatories of the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three, a document penned in support of the German invasion of Belgium in the early stages of World War I.

He died in Göttingen in 1925.

==Work==

Klein&#x27;s dissertation, on line geometry and its applications to mechanics, classified second degree line complexes using Weierstrass&#x27;s theory of elementary divisors.

Klein&#x27;s first important mathematical discoveries were made in 1870. In collaboration with Sophus Lie, he discovered the fundamental properties of the asymptotic lines on the Kummer surface. They later investigated W-curves, curves invariant under a group of projective transformations. It was Lie who introduced Klein to the concept of group, which was to have a major role in his later work. Klein also learned about groups from Camille Jordan.

Klein devised the &quot;Klein bottle&quot; named after him, a one-sided closed surface which cannot be embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space, but it may be immersed as a cylinder looped back through itself to join with its other end from the &quot;inside&quot;. It may be embedded in the Euclidean space of dimensions 4 and higher. The concept of a Klein Bottle was devised as a 3-Dimensional Möbius strip, with one method of construction being the attachment of the edges of two Möbius strips.

During the 1890s, Klein began studying mathematical physics more intensively, writing on the gyroscope with Arnold Sommerfeld. During 1894, he initiated the idea of an encyclopedia of mathematics including its applications, which became the &quot;Encyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften&quot;. This enterprise, which endured until 1935, provided an important standard reference of enduring value.

===Erlangen program===
In 1871, while at Göttingen, Klein made major discoveries in geometry. He published two papers &quot;On the So-called Non-Euclidean Geometry&quot; showing that Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries could be considered metric spaces determined by a Cayley–Klein metric. This insight had the corollary that non-Euclidean geometry was consistent if and only if Euclidean geometry was, giving the same status to geometries Euclidean and non-Euclidean, and ending all controversy about non-Euclidean geometry. Arthur Cayley never accepted Klein&#x27;s argument, believing it to be circular.

Klein&#x27;s synthesis of geometry as the study of the properties of a space that is invariant under a given group of transformations, known as the &quot;Erlangen program&quot; (1872), profoundly influenced the evolution of mathematics. This program was initiated by Klein&#x27;s inaugural lecture as professor at Erlangen, although it was not the actual speech he gave on the occasion. The program proposed a unified system of geometry that has become the accepted modern method. Klein showed how the essential properties of a given geometry could be represented by the group of transformations that preserve those properties. Thus the program&#x27;s definition of geometry encompassed both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry.

Currently, the significance of Klein&#x27;s contributions to geometry is evident. They have become so much part of mathematical thinking that it is difficult to appreciate their novelty when first presented, and understand the fact that they were not immediately accepted by all his contemporaries.

===Complex analysis===
Klein saw his work on complex analysis as his major contribution to mathematics, specifically his work on:
*The link between certain ideas of Riemann and invariant theory,
*Number theory and abstract algebra;
*Group theory;
*Geometry in more than 3 dimensions and differential equations, especially equations he invented, satisfied by elliptic modular functions and automorphic functions.

Klein showed that the modular group moves the fundamental region of the complex plane so as to tessellate the plane. In 1879, he examined the action of PSL(2,7), considered as an image of the modular group, and obtained an explicit representation of a Riemann surface now termed the Klein quartic. He showed that it was a complex curve in projective space, that its equation was &quot;x&#x27;y&quot; + &quot;y&#x27;z&quot; + &quot;z&quot;&quot;x&quot; = 0, and that its group of symmetries was PSL(2,7) of order 168. His &quot;Ueber Riemann&#x27;s Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen und ihre Integrale&quot; (1882) treats complex analysis in a geometric way, connecting potential theory and conformal mappings. This work drew on notions from fluid dynamics.

Klein considered equations of degree &gt; 4, and was especially interested in using transcendental methods to solve the general equation of the fifth degree. Building on methods of Charles Hermite and Leopold Kronecker, he produced similar results to those of Brioschi and later completely solved the problem by means of the icosahedral group. This work enabled him to write a series of papers on elliptic modular functions.

In his 1884 book on the icosahedron, Klein established a theory of automorphic functions, associating algebra and geometry. Poincaré had published an outline of his theory of automorphic functions in 1881, which resulted in a friendly rivalry between the two men. Both sought to state and prove a grand uniformization theorem that would establish the new theory more completely. Klein succeeded in formulating such a theorem and in describing a strategy for proving it. He came up with his proof during an asthma attack at 2:30 A.M. on 23 March 1882.

Klein summarized his work on automorphic and elliptic modular functions in a four volume treatise, written with Robert Fricke over a period of about 20 years.

<text>In abstract algebra, group theory studies the algebraic structures known as groups. 
The concept of a group is central to abstract algebra: other well-known algebraic structures, such as rings, fields, and vector spaces, can all be seen as groups endowed with additional operations and axioms. Groups recur throughout mathematics, and the methods of group theory have influenced many parts of algebra. Linear algebraic groups and Lie groups are two branches of group theory that have experienced advances and have become subject areas in their own right.

Various physical systems, such as crystals and the hydrogen atom, and three of the four known fundamental forces in the universe, may be modelled by symmetry groups. Thus group theory and the closely related representation theory have many important applications in physics, chemistry, and materials science. Group theory is also central to public key cryptography.

The early history of group theory dates from the 19th century. One of the most important mathematical achievements of the 20th century was the collaborative effort, taking up more than 10,000 journal pages and mostly published between 1960 and 2004, that culminated in a complete classification of finite simple groups.

==History==

Group theory has three main historical sources: number theory, the theory of algebraic equations, and geometry. The number-theoretic strand was begun by Leonhard Euler, and developed by Gauss&#x27;s work on modular arithmetic and additive and multiplicative groups related to quadratic fields. Early results about permutation groups were obtained by Lagrange, Ruffini, and Abel in their quest for general solutions of polynomial equations of high degree. Évariste Galois coined the term &quot;group&quot; and established a connection, now known as Galois theory, between the nascent theory of groups and field theory. In geometry, groups first became important in projective geometry and, later, non-Euclidean geometry. Felix Klein&#x27;s Erlangen program proclaimed group theory to be the organizing principle of geometry.

Galois, in the 1830s, was the first to employ groups to determine the solvability of polynomial equations. Arthur Cayley and Augustin Louis Cauchy pushed these investigations further by creating the theory of permutation groups. The second historical source for groups stems from geometrical situations. In an attempt to come to grips with possible geometries (such as euclidean, hyperbolic or projective geometry) using group theory, Felix Klein initiated the Erlangen programme. Sophus Lie, in 1884, started using groups (now called Lie groups) attached to analytic problems. Thirdly, groups were, at first implicitly and later explicitly, used in algebraic number theory.

The different scope of these early sources resulted in different notions of groups. The theory of groups was unified starting around 1880. Since then, the impact of group theory has been ever growing, giving rise to the birth of abstract algebra in the early 20th century, representation theory, and many more influential spin-off domains. The classification of finite simple groups is a vast body of work from the mid 20th century, classifying all the finite simple groups.

==Main classes of groups==
The range of groups being considered has gradually expanded from finite permutation groups and special examples of matrix groups to abstract groups that may be specified through a presentation by generators and relations.

===Permutation groups===
The first class of groups to undergo a systematic study was permutation groups. Given any set &quot;X&quot; and a collection &quot;G&quot; of bijections of &quot;X&quot; into itself (known as &quot;permutations&quot;) that is closed under compositions and inverses, &quot;G&quot; is a group acting on &quot;X&quot;. If &quot;X&quot; consists of &quot;n&quot; elements and &quot;G&quot; consists of &quot;all&quot; permutations, &quot;G&quot; is the symmetric group S&quot;n&quot;; in general, any permutation group &quot;G&quot; is a subgroup of the symmetric group of &quot;X&quot;. An early construction due to Cayley exhibited any group as a permutation group, acting on itself () by means of the left regular representation.

In many cases, the structure of a permutation group can be studied using the properties of its action on the corresponding set. For example, in this way one proves that for , the alternating group A&quot;n&quot; is simple, i.e. does not admit any proper normal subgroups. This fact plays a key role in the impossibility of solving a general algebraic equation of degree in radicals.

===Matrix groups===
The next important class of groups is given by &quot;matrix groups&quot;, or linear groups. Here &quot;G&quot; is a set consisting of invertible matrices of given order &quot;n&quot; over a field &quot;K&quot; that is closed under the products and inverses. Such a group acts on the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector space &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot; by linear transformations. This action makes matrix groups conceptually similar to permutation groups, and the geometry of the action may be usefully exploited to establish properties of the group &quot;G&quot;.

===Transformation groups===
Permutation groups and matrix groups are special cases of transformation groups: groups that act on a certain space &quot;X&quot; preserving its inherent structure. In the case of permutation groups, &quot;X&quot; is a set; for matrix groups, &quot;X&quot; is a vector space. The concept of a transformation group is closely related with the concept of a symmetry group: transformation groups frequently consist of &quot;all&quot; transformations that preserve a certain structure.
The theory of transformation groups forms a bridge connecting group theory with differential geometry. A long line of research, originating with Lie and Klein, considers group actions on manifolds by homeomorphisms or diffeomorphisms. The groups themselves may be discrete or continuous.

===Abstract groups===
Most groups considered in the first stage of the development of group theory were &quot;concrete&quot;, having been realized through numbers, permutations, or matrices. It was not until the late nineteenth century that the idea of an abstract group began to take hold, where &quot;abstract&quot; means that the nature of the elements are ignored in such a way that two isomorphic groups are considered as the same group. A typical way of specifying an abstract group is through a presentation by &quot;generators and relations&quot;,

: formula_1

A significant source of abstract groups is given by the construction of a &quot;factor group&quot;, or quotient group, &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;, of a group &quot;G&quot; by a normal subgroup &quot;H&quot;. Class groups of algebraic number fields were among the earliest examples of factor groups, of much interest in number theory. If a group &quot;G&quot; is a permutation group on a set &quot;X&quot;, the factor group &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; is no longer acting on &quot;X&quot;; but the idea of an abstract group permits one not to worry about this discrepancy.

The change of perspective from concrete to abstract groups makes it natural to consider properties of groups that are independent of a particular realization, or in modern language, invariant under isomorphism, as well as the classes of group with a given such property: finite groups, periodic groups, simple groups, solvable groups, and so on. Rather than exploring properties of an individual group, one seeks to establish results that apply to a whole class of groups. The new paradigm was of paramount importance for the development of mathematics: it foreshadowed the creation of abstract algebra in the works of Hilbert, Emil Artin, Emmy Noether, and mathematicians of their school.

=== Groups with additional structure ===
An important elaboration of the concept of a group occurs if &quot;G&quot; is endowed with additional structure, notably, of a topological space, differentiable manifold, or algebraic variety. If the group operations &quot;m&quot; (multiplication) and &quot;i&quot; (inversion),

: formula_2

are compatible with this structure, that is, they are continuous, smooth or regular (in the sense of algebraic geometry) maps, then &quot;G&quot; is a topological group, a Lie group, or an algebraic group.

The presence of extra structure relates these types of groups with other mathematical disciplines and means that more tools are available in their study. Topological groups form a natural domain for abstract harmonic analysis, whereas Lie groups (frequently realized as transformation groups) are the mainstays of differential geometry and unitary representation theory. Certain classification questions that cannot be solved in general can be approached and resolved for special subclasses of groups. Thus, compact connected Lie groups have been completely classified. There is a fruitful relation between infinite abstract groups and topological groups: whenever a group &quot;Γ&quot; can be realized as a lattice in a topological group &quot;G&quot;, the geometry and analysis pertaining to &quot;G&quot; yield important results about &quot;Γ&quot;. A comparatively recent trend in the theory of finite groups exploits their connections with compact topological groups (profinite groups): for example, a single &quot;p&quot;-adic analytic group &quot;G&quot; has a family of quotients which are finite &quot;p&quot;-groups of various orders, and properties of &quot;G&quot; translate into the properties of its finite quotients.

==Branches of group theory==

===Finite group theory===

During the twentieth century, mathematicians investigated some aspects of the theory of finite groups in great depth, especially the local theory of finite groups and the theory of solvable and nilpotent groups. As a consequence, the complete classification of finite simple groups was achieved, meaning that all those simple groups from which all finite groups can be built are now known.

During the second half of the twentieth century, mathematicians such as Chevalley and Steinberg also increased our understanding of finite analogs of classical groups, and other related groups. One such family of groups is the family of general linear groups over finite fields. 
Finite groups often occur when considering symmetry of mathematical or
physical objects, when those objects admit just a finite number of structure-preserving transformations. The theory of Lie groups,
which may be viewed as dealing with &quot;continuous symmetry&quot;, is strongly influenced by the associated Weyl groups. These are finite groups generated by reflections which act on a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. The properties of finite groups can thus play a role in subjects such as theoretical physics and chemistry.

===Representation of groups===

Saying that a group &quot;G&quot; &quot;acts&quot; on a set &quot;X&quot; means that every element of &quot;G&quot; defines a bijective map on the set &quot;X&quot; in a way compatible with the group structure. When &quot;X&quot; has more structure, it is useful to restrict this notion further: a representation of &quot;G&quot; on a vector space &quot;V&quot; is a group homomorphism:

:formula_3

where GL(&quot;V&quot;) consists of the invertible linear transformations of &quot;V&quot;. In other words, to every group element &quot;g&quot; is assigned an automorphism &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;g&quot;) such that for any &quot;h&quot; in &quot;G&quot;.

This definition can be understood in two directions, both of which give rise to whole new domains of mathematics. On the one hand, it may yield new information about the group &quot;G&quot;: often, the group operation in &quot;G&quot; is abstractly given, but via &quot;ρ&quot;, it corresponds to the multiplication of matrices, which is very explicit. On the other hand, given a well-understood group acting on a complicated object, this simplifies the study of the object in question. For example, if &quot;G&quot; is finite, it is known that &quot;V&quot; above decomposes into irreducible parts (see Maschke&#x27;s theorem). These parts, in turn, are much more easily manageable than the whole &quot;V&quot; (via Schur&#x27;s lemma).

Given a group &quot;G&quot;, representation theory then asks what representations of &quot;G&quot; exist. There are several settings, and the employed methods and obtained results are rather different in every case: representation theory of finite groups and representations of Lie groups are two main subdomains of the theory. The totality of representations is governed by the group&#x27;s characters. For example, Fourier polynomials can be interpreted as the characters of U(1), the group of complex numbers of absolute value &quot;1&quot;, acting on the &quot;L&quot;2-space of periodic functions.

===Lie theory===

A Lie group is a group that is also a differentiable manifold, with the property that the group operations are compatible with the smooth structure. Lie groups are named after Sophus Lie, who laid the foundations of the theory of continuous transformation groups. The term &quot;groupes de Lie&quot; first appeared in French in 1893 in the thesis of Lie&#x27;s student Arthur Tresse, page 3.

Lie groups represent the best-developed theory of continuous symmetry of mathematical objects and structures, which makes them indispensable tools for many parts of contemporary mathematics, as well as for modern theoretical physics. They provide a natural framework for analysing the continuous symmetries of differential equations (differential Galois theory), in much the same way as permutation groups are used in Galois theory for analysing the discrete symmetries of algebraic equations. An extension of Galois theory to the case of continuous symmetry groups was one of Lie&#x27;s principal motivations.

===Combinatorial and geometric group theory===

Groups can be described in different ways. Finite groups can be described by writing down the group table consisting of all possible multiplications . A more compact way of defining a group is by &quot;generators and relations&quot;, also called the &quot;presentation&quot; of a group. Given any set &quot;F&quot; of generators formula_4, the free group generated by &quot;F&quot; surjects onto the group &quot;G&quot;. The kernel of this map is called the subgroup of relations, generated by some subset &quot;D&quot;. The presentation is usually denoted by formula_5 For example, the group presentation formula_6 describes a group which is isomorphic to formula_7 A string consisting of generator symbols and their inverses is called a &quot;word&quot;.

Combinatorial group theory studies groups from the perspective of generators and relations. It is particularly useful where finiteness assumptions are satisfied, for example finitely generated groups, or finitely presented groups (i.e. in addition the relations are finite). The area makes use of the connection of graphs via their fundamental groups. A fundamental theorem of this area is that every subgroup of a free group is free.

There are several natural questions arising from giving a group by its presentation. The &quot;word problem&quot; asks whether two words are effectively the same group element. By relating the problem to Turing machines, one can show that there is in general no algorithm solving this task. Another, generally harder, algorithmically insoluble problem is the group isomorphism problem, which asks whether two groups given by different presentations are actually isomorphic. For example, the group with presentation formula_8 is isomorphic to the additive group Z of integers, although this may not be immediately apparent. (Writing formula_9, one has formula_10)
Geometric group theory attacks these problems from a geometric viewpoint, either by viewing groups as geometric objects, or by finding suitable geometric objects a group acts on. The first idea is made precise by means of the Cayley graph, whose vertices correspond to group elements and edges correspond to right multiplication in the group. Given two elements, one constructs the word metric given by the length of the minimal path between the elements. A theorem of Milnor and Svarc then says that given a group &quot;G&quot; acting in a reasonable manner on a metric space &quot;X&quot;, for example a compact manifold, then &quot;G&quot; is quasi-isometric (i.e. looks similar from a distance) to the space &quot;X&quot;.

==Connection of groups and symmetry==

Given a structured object &quot;X&quot; of any sort, a symmetry is a mapping of the object onto itself which preserves the structure. This occurs in many cases, for example
*If &quot;X&quot; is a set with no additional structure, a symmetry is a bijective map from the set to itself, giving rise to permutation groups.
*If the object &quot;X&quot; is a set of points in the plane with its metric structure or any other metric space, a symmetry is a bijection of the set to itself which preserves the distance between each pair of points (an isometry). The corresponding group is called isometry group of &quot;X&quot;.
*If instead angles are preserved, one speaks of conformal maps. Conformal maps give rise to Kleinian groups, for example.
*Symmetries are not restricted to geometrical objects, but include algebraic objects as well. For instance, the equation formula_11 has the two solutions formula_12 and formula_13. In this case, the group that exchanges the two roots is the Galois group belonging to the equation. Every polynomial equation in one variable has a Galois group, that is a certain permutation group on its roots.

The axioms of a group formalize the essential aspects of symmetry. Symmetries form a group: they are closed because if you take a symmetry of an object, and then apply another symmetry, the result will still be a symmetry. The identity keeping the object fixed is always a symmetry of an object. Existence of inverses is guaranteed by undoing the symmetry and the associativity comes from the fact that symmetries are functions on a space, and composition of functions is associative.

Frucht&#x27;s theorem says that every group is the symmetry group of some graph. So every abstract group is actually the symmetries of some explicit object.

The saying of &quot;preserving the structure&quot; of an object can be made precise by working in a category. Maps preserving the structure are then the morphisms, and the symmetry group is the automorphism group of the object in question.

==Applications of group theory==
Applications of group theory abound. Almost all structures in abstract algebra are special cases of groups. Rings, for example, can be viewed as abelian groups (corresponding to addition) together with a second operation (corresponding to multiplication). Therefore, group theoretic arguments underlie large parts of the theory of those entities.

===Galois theory===

Galois theory uses groups to describe the symmetries of the roots of a polynomial (or more precisely the automorphisms of the algebras generated by these roots). The fundamental theorem of Galois theory provides a link between algebraic field extensions and group theory. It gives an effective criterion for the solvability of polynomial equations in terms of the solvability of the corresponding Galois group. For example, &quot;S&quot;5, the symmetric group in 5 elements, is not solvable which implies that the general quintic equation cannot be solved by radicals in the way equations of lower degree can. The theory, being one of the historical roots of group theory, is still fruitfully applied to yield new results in areas such as class field theory.

===Algebraic topology===

Algebraic topology is another domain which prominently associates groups to the objects the theory is interested in. There, groups are used to describe certain invariants of topological spaces. They are called &quot;invariants&quot; because they are defined in such a way that they do not change if the space is subjected to some deformation. For example, the fundamental group &quot;counts&quot; how many paths in the space are essentially different. The Poincaré conjecture, proved in 2002/2003 by Grigori Perelman, is a prominent application of this idea. The influence is not unidirectional, though. For example, algebraic topology makes use of Eilenberg–MacLane spaces which are spaces with prescribed homotopy groups. Similarly algebraic K-theory relies in a way on classifying spaces of groups. Finally, the name of the torsion subgroup of an infinite group shows the legacy of topology in group theory.

===Algebraic geometry===

Algebraic geometry likewise uses group theory in many ways. Abelian varieties have been introduced above. The presence of the group operation yields additional information which makes these varieties particularly accessible. They also often serve as a test for new conjectures. (For example the Hodge conjecture (in certain cases).) The one-dimensional case, namely elliptic curves is studied in particular detail. They are both theoretically and practically intriguing. In another direction, toric varieties are algebraic varieties acted on by a torus. Toroidal embeddings have recently led to advances in algebraic geometry, in particular resolution of singularities.

===Algebraic number theory===

Algebraic number theory makes uses of groups for some important applications. For example, Euler&#x27;s product formula,
:formula_14
captures the fact that any integer decomposes in a unique way into primes. The failure of this statement for more general rings gives rise to class groups and regular primes, which feature in Kummer&#x27;s treatment of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.

===Harmonic analysis===

Analysis on Lie groups and certain other groups is called harmonic analysis. Haar measures, that is, integrals invariant under the translation in a Lie group, are used for pattern recognition and other image processing techniques.

===Combinatorics===
In combinatorics, the notion of permutation group and the concept of group action are often used to simplify the counting of a set of objects; see in particular Burnside&#x27;s lemma.

===Music===
The presence of the 12-periodicity in the circle of fifths yields applications of elementary group theory in musical set theory. Transformational theory models musical transformations as elements of a mathematical group.

===Physics===
In physics, groups are important because they describe the symmetries which the laws of physics seem to obey. According to Noether&#x27;s theorem, every continuous symmetry of a physical system corresponds to a conservation law of the system. Physicists are very interested in group representations, especially of Lie groups, since these representations often point the way to the &quot;possible&quot; physical theories. Examples of the use of groups in physics include the Standard Model, gauge theory, the Lorentz group, and the Poincaré group.

Group theory can be used to resolve the incompleteness of the statistical interpretations of mechanics developed by Willard Gibbs, relating to the summing of an infinite number of probabilities to yield a meaningful solution.

===Chemistry and materials science===

In chemistry and materials science, point groups are used to classify regular polyhedra, and the symmetries of molecules, and space groups to classify crystal structures. The assigned groups can then be used to determine physical properties (such as chemical polarity and chirality), spectroscopic properties (particularly useful for Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy), and to construct molecular orbitals.

Molecular symmetry is responsible for many physical and spectroscopic properties of compounds and provides relevant information about how chemical reactions occur. In order to assign a point group for any given molecule, it is necessary to find the set of symmetry operations present on it. The symmetry operation is an action, such as a rotation around an axis or a reflection through a mirror plane. In other words, it is an operation that moves the molecule such that it is indistinguishable from the original configuration. In group theory, the rotation axes and mirror planes are called &quot;symmetry elements&quot;. These elements can be a point, line or plane with respect to which the symmetry operation is carried out. The symmetry operations of a molecule determine the specific point group for this molecule.
In chemistry, there are five important symmetry operations. They are identity operation (E), rotation operation or proper rotation (C&quot;n&quot;), reflection operation (σ), inversion (i) and rotation reflection operation or improper rotation (S&quot;n&quot;). The identity operation (E) consists of leaving the molecule as it is. This is equivalent to any number of full rotations around any axis. This is a symmetry of all molecules, whereas the symmetry group of a chiral molecule consists of only the identity operation. An identity operation is a characteristic of every molecule even if it has no symmetry. Rotation around an axis (C&quot;n&quot;) consists of rotating the molecule around a specific axis by a specific angle. It is rotation through the angle 360°/&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is an integer, about a rotation axis. For example, if a water molecule rotates 180° around the axis that passes through the oxygen atom and between the hydrogen atoms, it is in the same configuration as it started. In this case, , since applying it twice produces the identity operation. In molecules with more than one rotation axis, the Cn axis having the largest value of n is the highest order rotation axis or principal axis. For example in boron trifluoride (BF3), the highest order of rotation axis is C3, so the principal axis of rotation is C3.

In the reflection operation (σ) many molecules have mirror planes, although they may not be obvious. The reflection operation exchanges left and right, as if each point had moved perpendicularly through the plane to a position exactly as far from the plane as when it started. When the plane is perpendicular to the principal axis of rotation, it is called σ&quot;h&quot; (horizontal). Other planes, which contain the principal axis of rotation, are labeled vertical (σ&quot;v&quot;) or dihedral (σ&quot;d&quot;).

Inversion (i ) is a more complex operation. Each point moves through the center of the molecule to a position opposite the original position and as far from the central point as where it started. Many molecules that seem at first glance to have an inversion center do not; for example, methane and other tetrahedral molecules lack inversion symmetry. To see this, hold a methane model with two hydrogen atoms in the vertical plane on the right and two hydrogen atoms in the horizontal plane on the left. Inversion results in two hydrogen atoms in the horizontal plane on the right and two hydrogen atoms in the vertical plane on the left. Inversion is therefore not a symmetry operation of methane, because the orientation of the molecule following the inversion operation differs from the original orientation. And the last operation is improper rotation or rotation reflection operation (S&quot;n&quot;) requires rotation of  360°/&quot;n&quot;, followed by reflection through a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation.

===Cryptography===
Very large groups of prime order constructed in elliptic curve cryptography serve for public-key cryptography. Cryptographical methods of this kind benefit from the flexibility of the geometric objects, hence their group structures, together with the complicated structure of these groups, which make the discrete logarithm very hard to calculate. One of the earliest encryption protocols, Caesar&#x27;s cipher, may also be interpreted as a (very easy) group operation. Most cryptographic schemes use groups in some way. In particular Diffie–Hellman key exchange uses finite cyclic groups. So the term group-based cryptography refers mostly to cryptographic protocols that use infinite non-abelian groups such as a braid group.

<text>Stable nuclides are isotopes of a chemical element whose nucleons are in a configuration that does not permit them the surplus energy required to produce a radioactive emission. The nuclei of such isotopes are not radioactive and unlike radionuclides do not spontaneously undergo radioactive decay. When these nuclides are referred to in relation to specific elements they are usually called that element&#x27;s stable isotopes.

The 80 elements with one or more stable isotopes comprise a total of 251 nuclides that have not been shown to decay using current equipment. Of these 80 elements, 26 have only one stable isotope and are called monoisotopic. The other 56 have more than one stable isotope. Tin has ten stable isotopes, the largest number of any element.

== Definition of stability, and naturally occurring nuclides ==

Most naturally occurring nuclides are stable (about 251; see list at the end of this article), and about 35 more (total of 286) are known to be radioactive with long enough half-lives (also known) to occur primordially. If the half-life of a nuclide is comparable to, or greater than, the Earth&#x27;s age (4.5 billion years), a significant amount will have survived since the formation of the Solar System, and then is said to be primordial. It will then contribute in that way to the natural isotopic composition of a chemical element. Primordial radioisotopes are easily detected with half-lives as short as 700 million years (e.g., U). This is the present limit of detection, as shorter-lived nuclides have not yet been detected undisputedly in nature except when recently produced, such as decay products or cosmic ray spallation.

Many naturally occurring radioisotopes (another 53 or so, for a total of about 339) exhibit still shorter half-lives than 700 million years, but they are made freshly, as daughter products of decay processes of primordial nuclides (for example, radium from uranium), or from ongoing energetic reactions, such as cosmogenic nuclides produced by present bombardment of Earth by cosmic rays (for example, C made from nitrogen).

Some isotopes that are classed as stable (i.e. no radioactivity has been observed for them) are predicted to have extremely long half-lives (sometimes 10 years or more). If the predicted half-life falls into an experimentally accessible range, such isotopes have a chance to move from the list of stable nuclides to the radioactive category, once their activity is observed. For example, Bi and W were formerly classed as stable, but were found to be alpha-active in 2003. However, such nuclides do not change their status as primordial when they are found to be radioactive.

Most stable isotopes on Earth are believed to have been formed in processes of nucleosynthesis, either in the Big Bang, or in generations of stars that preceded the formation of the Solar System. However, some stable isotopes also show abundance variations in the earth as a result of decay from long-lived radioactive nuclides. These decay-products are termed radiogenic isotopes, in order to distinguish them from the much larger group of &#x27;non-radiogenic&#x27; isotopes.

== Isotopes per element ==
Of the known chemical elements, 80 elements have at least one stable nuclide. These comprise the first 82 elements from hydrogen to lead, with the two exceptions, technetium (element 43) and promethium (element 61), that do not have any stable nuclides. As of 2024, there are total of 251 known &quot;stable&quot; nuclides. In this definition, &quot;stable&quot; means a nuclide that has never been observed to decay against the natural background. Thus, these elements have half-lives too long to be measured by any means, direct or indirect.

Stable isotopes:
* 1 element (tin) has 10 stable isotopes
* 5 elements have 7 stable isotopes apiece
* 7 elements have 6 stable isotopes apiece
* 11 elements have 5 stable isotopes apiece
* 9 elements have 4 stable isotopes apiece
* 5 elements have 3 stable isotopes apiece
* 16 elements have 2 stable isotopes apiece
* 26 elements have 1 single stable isotope.

These last 26 are thus called &quot;monoisotopic elements&quot;. The mean number of stable isotopes for elements which have at least one stable isotope is 251/80 = 3.1375.

=== Physical magic numbers and odd and even proton and neutron count ===

Stability of isotopes is affected by the ratio of protons to neutrons, and also by presence of certain magic numbers of neutrons or protons which represent closed and filled quantum shells. These quantum shells correspond to a set of energy levels within the shell model of the nucleus; filled shells, such as the filled shell of 50 protons for tin, confers unusual stability on the nuclide. As in the case of tin, a magic number for &quot;Z&quot;, the atomic number, tends to increase the number of stable isotopes for the element.

Just as in the case of electrons, which have the lowest energy state when they occur in pairs in a given orbital, nucleons (both protons and neutrons) exhibit a lower energy state when their number is even, rather than odd. This stability tends to prevent beta decay (in two steps) of many even–even nuclides into another even–even nuclide of the same mass number but lower energy (and of course with two more protons and two fewer neutrons), because decay proceeding one step at a time would have to pass through an odd–odd nuclide of higher energy. Such nuclei thus instead undergo double beta decay (or are theorized to do so) with half-lives several orders of magnitude larger than the age of the universe. This makes for a larger number of stable even–even nuclides, which account for 150 of the 251 total. Stable even–even nuclides number as many as three isobars for some mass numbers, and up to seven isotopes for some atomic numbers.

Conversely, of the 251 known stable nuclides, only five have both an odd number of protons &quot;and&quot; odd number of neutrons: hydrogen-2 (deuterium), lithium-6, boron-10, nitrogen-14, and tantalum-180m. Also, only four naturally occurring, radioactive odd–odd nuclides have a half-life &gt;10 years: potassium-40, vanadium-50, lanthanum-138, and lutetium-176. Odd–odd primordial nuclides are rare because most odd–odd nuclei beta-decay, because the decay products are even–even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects.

Yet another effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleon is that odd-numbered elements tend to have fewer stable isotopes. Of the 26 monoisotopic elements (those with only one stable isotope), all but one have an odd atomic number, and all but one has an even number of neutrons: the single exception to both rules is beryllium.

The end of the stable elements occurs after lead, largely because nuclei with 128 neutrons—two neutrons above the magic number 126—are extraordinarily unstable and almost immediately alpha-decay. This contributes to the very short half-lives of astatine, radon, and francium. A similar phenomenon occurs to a much lesser extent with 84 neutrons—two neutrons above the magic number 82—where various isotopes of lanthanide elements alpha-decay.

=== Nuclear isomers, including a &quot;stable&quot; one ===
The 251 known stable nuclides include tantalum-180m, since even though its decay is automatically implied by its being &quot;metastable&quot;, this has not been observed. All &quot;stable&quot; isotopes (stable by observation, not theory) are the ground states of nuclei, except for tantalum-180m, which is a nuclear isomer or excited state. The ground state, tantalum-180, is radioactive with half-life 8 hours; in contrast, the decay of the nuclear isomer is extremely strongly forbidden by spin-parity selection rules. It has been reported by direct observation that the half-life of Ta to gamma decay must be &gt;10 years. Other possible modes of Ta decay (beta decay, electron capture, and alpha decay) have also never been observed.

== Still-unobserved decay ==
It is expected that improvement of experimental sensitivity will allow discovery of very mild radioactivity of some isotopes now considered stable. For example, in 2003 it was reported that bismuth-209 (the only primordial isotope of bismuth) is very mildly radioactive, with half-life (1.9 ± 0.2) × 10 yr, confirming earlier theoretical predictions from nuclear physics that bismuth-209 would very slowly alpha decay.

Isotopes that are theoretically believed to be unstable but have not been observed to decay are termed observationally stable. Currently there are 105 &quot;stable&quot; isotopes which are theoretically unstable, 40 of which have been observed in detail with no sign of decay, the lightest in any case being Ar. Many &quot;stable&quot; nuclides are &quot;metastable&quot; in that they would release energy if they were to decay, and are expected to undergo very rare kinds of radioactive decay, including double beta decay.

146 nuclides from 62 elements with atomic numbers from 1 (hydrogen) through 66 (dysprosium) except 43 (technetium), 61 (promethium), 62 (samarium), and 63 (europium) are theoretically stable to any kind of nuclear decay — except for the theoretical possibility of proton decay, which has never been observed despite extensive searches for it; and spontaneous fission (SF), which is theoretically possible for the nuclides with atomic mass numbers ≥ 93.

Besides SF, other theoretical decay routes for heavier elements include:
* alpha decay – 70 heavy nuclides (the lightest two are cerium-142 and neodymium-143)
* double beta decay – 55 nuclides
* beta decay – tantalum-180m
* electron capture – tellurium-123, tantalum-180m
* double electron capture
* isomeric transition – tantalum-180m

These include all nuclides of mass 165 and greater. Argon-36 is the lightest known &quot;stable&quot; nuclide which is theoretically unstable.

The positivity of energy release in these processes means they are allowed kinematically (they do not violate conservation of energy) and, thus, in principle, can occur. They are not observed due to strong but not absolute suppression, by spin-parity selection rules (for beta decays and isomeric transitions) or by the thickness of the potential barrier (for alpha and cluster decays and spontaneous fission).

== Summary table for numbers of each class of nuclides ==

This is a summary table from List of nuclides. Numbers are not exact and may change slightly in the future, as nuclides are observed to be radioactive, or new half-lives are determined to some precision.

== List of stable nuclides ==
The primordial radionuclides are included for comparison; they are italicized and offset from the list of stable nuclides proper.

Abbreviations for predicted unobserved decay:

α for alpha decay, B for beta decay, 2B for double beta decay, E for electron capture, 2E for double electron capture, IT for isomeric transition, SF for spontaneous fission, * for the nuclides whose half-lives have lower bound. Double beta decay has only been listed when beta decay is not also possible.

^ Tantalum-180m is a &quot;metastable isotope&quot;, meaning it is an excited nuclear isomer of tantalum-180. See isotopes of tantalum. However, the half-life of this nuclear isomer is so long that it has never been observed to decay, and it thus is an &quot;observationally stable&quot; primordial nuclide, a rare isotope of tantalum. This is the only nuclear isomer with a half-life so long that it has never been observed to decay. It is thus included in this list.

^^ Bismuth-209 was long believed to be stable, due to its half-life of 2.01×10 years, which is more than a billion times the age of the universe.

§ Europium-151 and samarium-147 are primordial nuclides with very long half-lives of 4.62×10 years and 1.066×10 years, respectively.

<doc id="41896" wikidata="Q2518" url="?curid=41896" title="Helmut Kohl">
<text>Helmut Josef Michael Kohl (; 3 April 1930 – 16 June 2017) was a German politician who served as chancellor of Germany from 1990 to 1998 and, prior to German reunification, as the chancellor of West Germany from 1982 to 1990. He was leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) from 1973 to 1998 and oversaw the end of the Cold War, the German reunification and the creation of the European Union (EU). Kohl’s 16-year tenure is the longest of any German chancellor since Otto von Bismarck, and is the longest for any democratically elected chancellor of Germany.

Born in Ludwigshafen to a Catholic family, Kohl joined the CDU in 1946 at the age of 16. He earned a PhD in history at Heidelberg University in 1958 and worked as a business executive before becoming a full-time politician. He was elected as the youngest member of the Parliament of Rhineland-Palatinate in 1959 and from 1969 to 1976 was minister president of the Rhineland-Palatinate state. Viewed during the 1960s and the early 1970s as a progressive within the CDU, he was elected national chairman of the party in 1973. After he had become party leader, Kohl was increasingly seen as a more conservative figure. In the 1976 and 1980 federal elections his party performed well, but the social-liberal government of social democrat Helmut Schmidt was able to remain in power. After Schmidt had lost the support of the liberal FDP in 1982, Kohl was elected Chancellor through a constructive vote of no confidence, forming a coalition government with the FDP. Kohl chaired the G7 in 1985 and 1992.

As Chancellor, Kohl was committed to European integration and especially to the Franco-German relationship; he was also a steadfast ally of the United States and supported Ronald Reagan&#x27;s more aggressive policies to weaken the Soviet Union. Following the Revolutions of 1989, his government acted decisively, culminating in the German reunification in 1990. Kohl and French president François Mitterrand were the architects of the Maastricht Treaty which established the EU and the Euro currency. Kohl was also a central figure in the eastern enlargement of the EU, and his government led the effort to push for international recognition of Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina when the states declared independence. He played an instrumental role in resolving the Bosnian War. Domestically Kohl&#x27;s policies from 1990 focused on integrating former East Germany into reunified Germany, and he moved the federal capital from the &quot;provisional capital&quot; Bonn back to Berlin, although he never resided there because the government offices were only relocated in 1999. Kohl also greatly increased federal spending on arts and culture. After his chancellorship, Kohl became honorary chairman of the CDU in 1998 but resigned from the position in 2000 in the wake of the CDU donations scandal which damaged his reputation domestically.

Kohl received the 1988 Charlemagne Prize and was named Honorary Citizen of Europe by the European Council in 1998. Following his death, Kohl was honoured with the first-ever European act of state in Strasbourg. Kohl was described as &quot;the greatest European leader of the second half of the 20th century&quot; by US presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton.
== Life ==
=== Youth and education ===
Kohl was born on 3 April 1930 in Ludwigshafen. He was the third child of Hans Kohl (3 January 1887 – 19 October 1975), a Bavarian army veteran and civil servant, and his wife, Cäcilie (&quot;née&quot; Schnur; 17 November 1892 – 1 August 1977).

Kohl&#x27;s family was conservative and Catholic and remained loyal to the Catholic Centre Party before and after 1933. His elder brother died in World War II as a teenage soldier. At the age of ten, Kohl was obliged, like most children in Germany at the time, to join the &quot;Deutsches Jungvolk&quot;, a section of the Hitler Youth. Aged 15, on 20 April 1945, Kohl was sworn into the Hitler Youth by leader Artur Axmann at Berchtesgaden, just days before the end of the war, as membership was mandatory for all boys of his age. Kohl was also drafted for military service in 1945; he was not involved in any combat, a fact he later referred to as the &quot;mercy of late birth&quot; (German: &quot;Gnade der späten Geburt&quot;).

Kohl attended the Ruprecht Elementary School and continued at the Max-Planck-Gymnasium. After graduating in 1950, Kohl began to study law in Frankfurt am Main, spending two semesters commuting between Ludwigshafen and Frankfurt. Here, Kohl heard lectures from Carlo Schmid and Walter Hallstein, among others. In 1951, Kohl switched to Heidelberg University, where he studied history and political science. Kohl was the first in his family to attend university.

=== Life before politics ===
After graduating in 1956, Kohl became a fellow at the Alfred Weber Institute of Heidelberg University under Dolf Sternberger where he was an active member of the student society AIESEC. In 1958, Kohl received his doctorate degree in history for his dissertation &quot;Die politische Entwicklung in der Pfalz und das Wiedererstehen der Parteien nach 1945&quot; (&quot;The Political Developments in the Palatinate and the Reconstruction of Political Parties after 1945&quot;), under the supervision of the historian Walther Peter Fuchs. After that, Kohl entered business, first as an assistant to the director of a foundry in Ludwigshafen, then, in April 1960, as a manager for the Industrial Union for Chemistry in Ludwigshafen.

=== Early political career ===

In 1946, Kohl joined the recently founded CDU, becoming a full member once he turned 18 in 1948. In 1947, Kohl was one of the co-founders of the Junge Union-branch in Ludwigshafen, the CDU youth organisation. In 1953, Kohl joined the board of the Palatinate branch of the CDU. In 1954, Kohl became vice-chair of the Junge Union in Rhineland-Palatinate, being a member of the board until 1961.

In January 1955, Kohl ran for a seat on the board of the Rhineland-Palatinate CDU, losing just narrowly to the state&#x27;s Minister of Family Affairs, Franz-Josef Wuermeling. Kohl was still able to take up a seat on the board, being sent there by his local party branch as a delegate. During his early years in the party, Kohl aimed to open it towards the young generation, turning away from a close relationship with the churches.

In early 1959, Kohl was elected chairman of the Ludwigshafen district branch of the CDU, as well as a candidate for the upcoming state elections. On 19 April 1959, Kohl was elected as the youngest member of the state diet, the Landtag of Rhineland-Palatinate. In 1960, he was also elected to the municipal council of Ludwigshafen where he served as leader of the CDU party until 1969. When the chairman of the CDU parliamentary group in the Landtag, Wilhelm Boden, died in late 1961, Kohl moved up into a deputy position. Following the next state election in 1963, he took over as chairman, a position he held until he became Minister-President in 1969. In 1966, Kohl and the incumbent minister-president and state party chairman, Peter Altmeier, agreed to share duties. In March 1966, Kohl was elected as chairman of the party in Rhineland-Palatinate, while Altmeier once again ran for minister-president in the state elections in 1967, agreeing to hand the post over to Kohl after two years, halfway into the legislative period.

=== Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate ===

Kohl was elected minister-president of Rhineland-Palatinate on 19 May 1969, as the successor to Peter Altmeier. As of 2017, he was the youngest person ever to be elected as head of government in a German &quot;Bundesland&quot;. Just a few days after his election as minister-president, Kohl also became vice-chair of the federal CDU party. While in office, Kohl acted as a reformer, focusing on school and education. His government abolished school corporal punishment and the parochial school, topics that had been controversial with the conservative wing of his party. During his term, Kohl founded the University of Trier-Kaiserslautern. He also finalised a territorial reform of the state, standardising codes of law and re-aligning districts, an act that he had already pursued under Altmeier&#x27;s tenure, taking the chairmanship of the Landtag&#x27;s committee on the reform. After taking office, Kohl established two new ministries, one for economy and transportation and one for social matters, with the latter going to Heiner Geißler, who would work closely with Kohl for the next twenty years.

=== Federal party level, election as chairman of the CDU ===
Kohl moved up into the federal board (&quot;Vorstand&quot;) of the CDU in 1964. Two years later, shortly before his election as chairman of the party in Rhineland-Palatinate, he failed at an attempt to be voted into the executive committee (&quot;Präsidium&quot;) of the party. After the CDU lost its involvement in the federal government for the first time since the end of World War II in the 1969 election, Kohl was elected into the committee. While former chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger remained chairman of the CDU until 1971, it was now parliamentary chairman Rainer Barzel who led the opposition against the newly formed social-liberal coalition of Willy Brandt.

As a member of the board and the executive committee, Kohl pushed towards party reform, supporting liberal stances in education and social policies, including employee participation. When a proposal by the board was put to vote at a party convention in early 1971 in Düsseldorf, Kohl was unable to prevail against protest coming from the conservative wing of the party around Alfred Dregger and the sister party CSU, costing him support at the liberal wing of the party. To make matters worse, in a mistake during the voting process, Kohl himself voted against the proposal, further angering his supporters, such as party treasurer Walther Leisler Kiep.
Nevertheless, when Kiesinger stepped down as party chairman in 1971, Kohl was a candidate for his succession. He was unsuccessful, losing the vote to Barzel 344 to 174. In April 1972, in the light of Brandt&#x27;s &quot;Ostpolitik&quot;, the CDU aimed to depose Brandt and his government in a constructive vote of no confidence, replacing him with Barzel. The attempt failed, as two members of the opposition voted against Barzel. After Barzel also lost the general election later that year, the path was free for Kohl to take over. After Barzel announced on 10 May 1973 that he would not run for the post of party chairman again, Kohl succeeded him at a party convention in Bonn on 12 June 1973, amassing 520 of 600 votes, with him as the only candidate. Facing stiff opposition from the left wing of the party, Kohl initially expected only to serve as chairman for a couple of months, as his critics planned to replace him at another convention set for November in Hamburg. Kohl received the support of his party and remained in office, not least due to the lauded work of Kurt Biedenkopf, whom Kohl had brought in as Secretary General of the CDU. Kohl remained chairman until 1998.

When chancellor Brandt stepped down in May 1974 following the unravelling of the Guillaume Affair, Kohl urged his party to restrain from &quot;Schadenfreude&quot; and not to use the position of their political opponent for &quot;cheap polemics&quot;. In June, Kohl campaigned during the state elections in Lower Saxony for his party colleague Wilfried Hasselmann, leading the CDU to a strong result of 48.8% of the vote, even though it proved not enough to prevent a continuation of the social-liberal coalition in the state.

=== First candidacy for the chancellorship and the 1976 Bundestag election ===
On 9 March 1975, Kohl and the CDU faced re-election in Rhineland-Palatinate. What placed Kohl, who intended to run for chancellor, under increased pressure was the fact that the sister parties of CDU and CSU were set to decide upon their leading candidate for the upcoming federal elections in mid-1975. CSU chairman Franz Josef Strauss had ambitions to run and publicly put Kohl under pressure over what result would be acceptable in the state elections. On election day, the CDU achieved a result of 53.9 per cent, the highest-ever result in the state, consolidating Kohl&#x27;s position. Strauß&#x27;s bid for the chancellorship was further put into jeopardy when in March 1975 the magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; published a transcript of a speech held in November 1974, in which Strauß claimed that the Red Army Faction, a West German armed struggle group responsible for multiple attacks at the time, had sympathizers in the ranks of the SPD and FDP. The scandal deeply unsettled the public and effectively ruled out Strauß for the candidacy.

On 12 May 1975, the federal board of the CDU unanimously nominated Kohl as the candidate for the general elections, without consulting their Bavarian sister party beforehand. In reaction, the CSU nominated Strauß and only a mediation by former chancellor Kiesinger was able to resolve the issue and confirm Kohl as the candidate for both parties. In June 1975, Kohl was also re-elected as party chairman, achieving a result of 98.44 per cent.

Strauß took the discord as a starting point to evaluate chances of expanding the CSU on the federal level, such as having separate electoral lists in the states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Hamburg, and Bremen. He hoped to draw away right-wing voters from the FDP towards the CSU and went as far as having private meetings with industrialists in North Rhine-Westphalia. These attempts led to discomfort within the membership base of the CDU and hampered both parties&#x27; chances in the upcoming elections. Kohl himself remained silent during these tensions, which some interpreted as a lack of leadership, while others such as future president Karl Carstens praised him for seeking a consensus at the centre of the party. In the 1976 federal election, the CDU/CSU coalition performed very well, winning 48.6% of the vote. They were kept out of government by the centre-left cabinet formed by the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and Free Democratic Party (FDP), led by Social Democrat Helmut Schmidt. Kohl then retired as minister-president of Rhineland-Palatinate to become the leader of the CDU/CSU in the Bundestag. He was succeeded by Bernhard Vogel.

=== Leader of the opposition ===
In the 1980 federal elections, Kohl had to play second fiddle, when CSU leader Franz Josef Strauss became the CDU/CSU&#x27;s candidate for chancellor. Strauß was also unable to defeat the coalition of the SPD and the FDP. Unlike Kohl, Strauß did not want to continue as the leader of the CDU/CSU and remained Minister-President of Bavaria. Kohl remained as leader of the opposition, under the third Schmidt cabinet (1980–82). On 17 September 1982, a conflict of economic policy occurred between the governing SPD/FDP coalition partners. The FDP wanted to radically liberalise the labour market, while the SPD preferred greater job security. The FDP began talks with the CDU/CSU to form a new government.

== Chancellor of Germany, 1982–1998 ==
=== Rise to power and first cabinet, 1982–1983 ===
On 1 October 1982, the CDU proposed a constructive vote of no confidence which was supported by the FDP. The motion carried—to date, the only time that a chancellor has been deposed in this manner. Three days later, the Bundestag voted in a new CDU/CSU-FDP coalition cabinet, with Kohl as chancellor. Many of the important details of the new coalition had been hammered out on 20 September, though minor details were reportedly still being negotiated as the vote took place. 

Though Kohl&#x27;s election was done according to the Basic Law, it came amid some controversy. The FDP had fought its 1980 campaign on the side of the SPD and even placed Chancellor Schmidt on some of their campaign posters. There were also doubts that the new government had the support of a majority of the people. In answer, the new government aimed at new elections at the earliest possible date. Polls suggested that a clear majority was indeed within reach. As the Basic Law only allows the dissolution of parliament after an unsuccessful confidence motion, Kohl had to take another controversial move: he called for a confidence vote only a month after being sworn in, which he intentionally lost because the members of his coalition abstained. President Karl Carstens then dissolved the Bundestag at Kohl&#x27;s request and called new elections.

The move was controversial, as the coalition parties denied their votes to the same man they had elected Chancellor a month before and whom they wanted to re-elect after the parliamentary election. However, this step was condoned by the German Federal Constitutional Court as a legal instrument and was again applied by SPD Chancellor Gerhard Schröder in 2005.

=== Second cabinet, 1983–1987 ===
In the federal elections of March 1983, Kohl won a resounding victory. The CDU/CSU won 48.8%, while the FDP won 7.0%. Some opposition members of the Bundestag, angered by what SPD figures in the Hessian regional elections had called the FDP&#x27;s &#x27;betrayal in Bonn&#x27;, asked the Federal Constitutional Court to declare the whole proceeding unconstitutional. It denied their claim but did set restrictions on a similar move in the future. The second Kohl cabinet pushed through several controversial plans, including the stationing of NATO midrange missiles, against major opposition from the peace movement.
On 22 September 1984, Kohl met French president François Mitterrand at Verdun, where the Battle of Verdun between France and Germany had taken place during World War I. Together, they commemorated the deaths of both World Wars. The photograph, which depicted their minutes-long handshake became an important symbol of French-German reconciliation. Kohl and Mitterrand developed a close political relationship, forming an important motor for European integration. Together they laid the foundations for European projects, like Eurocorps and Arte. In 1985, alongside European leaders from 16 other countries, they founded Eureka: a research and development network of national funding ministries and agencies (distinct from the European Union) that fund and support collaborative international projects. This French-German cooperation also was vital for important European projects, like the Treaty of Maastricht and the Euro.

In 1985, Kohl and US president Ronald Reagan, as part of a plan to observe the 40th anniversary of V-E Day, saw an opportunity to demonstrate the strength of the friendship that existed between Germany and its former foe. During a November 1984 visit to the White House, Kohl appealed to Reagan to join him in symbolising the reconciliation of their two countries at a German military cemetery. Reagan visited Germany as part of the 11th G7 summit in Bonn; then he and Kohl visited Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on 5 May and the German military cemetery at Bitburg. There was widespread outrage when the media reported that this cemetery had the graves of SS soldiers but no Americans. Reagan considered that escalating Cold War confrontations with the Kremlin required his strong support for Kohl.

==== Domestic policies ====
Kohl&#x27;s chancellorship presided over a number of innovative policy measures. Extensions in unemployment benefits for older claimants were introduced, while the benefit for the young unemployed was extended to age 21. In 1986, a child-rearing allowance was introduced to benefit parents when at least one was employed. Informal carers were offered an attendance allowance together with tax incentives, both of which were established with the tax reforms of 1990, and were also guaranteed up to 25 hours a month of professional support, which was supplemented by four weeks of annual holiday relief. In 1984, an early retirement scheme was introduced that offered incentives to employers to replace elderly workers with applicants off the unemployment register. In 1989, a partial retirement plan was introduced under which elderly employees could work half-time and receive 70% of their former salary &quot;and be credited with 90 per cent of the full social insurance entitlement.&quot; In 1984, a Mother and Child Fund was established, providing discretionary grants &quot;to forestall abortions on grounds of material hardship,&quot; and in 1986 a 10 Bn DM package of Erziehungsgeld (childcare allowance) was introduced, although according to various studies, this latter initiative was heavily counterbalanced by cuts. In 1989, special provisions were introduced for the older unemployed.

Kohl&#x27;s time as Chancellor also saw some controversial decisions in the field of social policy. Student aid was made reimbursable to the state while the Health Care Reform Act of 1989 introduced the concept by which patients pay up front and are reimbursed, while increasing patient co-payments for hospitalisation, spa visits, dental prostheses, and prescription drugs. In addition, while a 1986 Baby-Year Pensions reform granted women born after 1921 one year of work-credit per child, lawmakers were forced by public protest to phase in supplementary pension benefits for mothers who were born before the cut-off year.

=== Third cabinet, 1987–1991 ===
After the 1987 federal elections Kohl won a slightly reduced majority and formed his third cabinet. The SPD&#x27;s candidate for chancellor was the Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia, Johannes Rau.

In 1987, Kohl hosted East German leader Erich Honecker – the first ever visit by an East German head of state to West Germany. This is generally seen as a sign that Kohl pursued &quot;Ostpolitik&quot;, a policy of détente between East and West that had been begun by the SPD-led governments (and strongly opposed by Kohl&#x27;s own CDU) during the 1970s.

==== Internal struggle for CDU leadership ====
The CDU&#x27;s general secretary, Heiner Geißler, considered the party to be in a downward spiral following the relatively poor showing in the 1987 elections. Behind the scenes, he attempted to find a majority to unseat Kohl as the party&#x27;s chairman and replace him with Lothar Späth, the Minister-president of Baden-Württemberg. Before the CDU party convention in Bremen started on 11 September 1989, Kohl was diagnosed with an inflammation of his prostate. His doctor recommended immediate surgery, but Kohl refused to miss the convention and attended while wearing a catheter and with his doctor by his side, whom he introduced as his new speech writer. In the end, the &quot;coup&quot; was unsuccessful, as Kohl was re-elected as chairman with 79.52% of the votes. Späth, who did not stand for the position of chairman after support for Kohl became apparent, was punished by his party, failing to be elected as vice-chairman with just 357 of 731 votes. Geißler meanwhile was relieved of his duties as general secretary and replaced by Volker Rühe.

==== Road to reunification ====
Following the breach of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the East German Communist regime in 1989, Kohl&#x27;s handling of the East German issue would become the turning point of his chancellorship. Kohl, like most West Germans, was initially caught unaware when the Socialist Unity Party was toppled in late 1989. Well aware of his constitutional mandate to seek German unity, he immediately moved to make it a reality. Taking advantage of the historic political changes occurring in East Germany, Kohl presented a ten-point plan for &quot;Overcoming of the division of Germany and Europe&quot; without consulting his coalition partner, the FDP, or the Western Allies. In February 1990, he visited the Soviet Union seeking a guarantee from Mikhail Gorbachev that the USSR would allow German reunification to proceed. One month later, the Party of Democratic Socialism – the renamed SED – was roundly defeated by a grand coalition headed by the East German counterpart of Kohl&#x27;s CDU, which ran on a platform of speedy reunification.

On 18 May 1990, Kohl signed an economic and social union treaty with East Germany. This treaty stipulated that when reunification took place, it would be under the quicker provisions of Article 23 of the Basic Law. That article stated that any new states could adhere to the Basic Law by a simple majority vote. The alternative would have been the more protracted route of drafting a completely new constitution for the newly reunified country, as provided by Article 146 of the Basic Law. However, the Article 146 process would have opened up contentious issues in West Germany. Even without this to consider, by this time East Germany was in a state of utter collapse. In contrast, an Article 23 reunification could be completed in as little as six months.

Over the objections of Bundesbank president Karl Otto Pöhl, he allowed a 1:1 exchange rate for wages, interest and rent between the West and East Marks. In the end, this policy would seriously hurt companies in the new federal states. Together with Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Kohl was able to resolve talks with the former Allies of World War II to allow German reunification. He received assurances from Gorbachev that a reunified Germany would be able to choose which international alliance it wanted to join, although Kohl made no secret that he wanted the reunified Germany to inherit West Germany&#x27;s seats at NATO and the EC.
A reunification treaty was signed on 31 August 1990 and was overwhelmingly approved by both parliaments on 20 September 1990. At midnight Central European Time on 3 October 1990, East Germany officially ceased to exist, and its territory joined the Federal Republic as the five states of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. These states had been the original five states of East Germany before being abolished in 1952 and had been reconstituted in August. East and West Berlin were reunited as a city-state which became the capital of the enlarged Federal Republic.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Kohl affirmed that former German territories east of the Oder-Neisse line were definitively part of Poland, thereby relinquishing any claim Germany had to them in a treaty signed on 14 November 1990 in Warsaw. Though, earlier in March of that year, Kohl caused a diplomatic firestorm when he suggested that a reunified Germany would not accept the Oder–Neisse line, and implied that the Federal Republic might wish to restore the frontier of 1937, by force if necessary. After the statement caused a major international backlash that threatened to halt German reunification, Kohl retracted his comments after knuckling under international rebuke and assured both the United States and the Soviet Union that a reunified Germany would accept the Oder–Neisse line as the final border between Poland and Germany. In 1993, Kohl confirmed, via treaty with the Czech Republic, that Germany would no longer bring forward territorial claims as to the pre-1945 ethnic German Sudetenland. This treaty was a disappointment for the German Heimatvertriebene (&quot;displaced persons&quot;).

=== After reunification, 1990–1998 ===
Reunification placed Kohl in a momentarily unassailable position. In the 1990 elections – the first free, fair and democratic all-German elections since the Weimar Republic era – Kohl won by a landslide over opposition candidate and Minister-President of Saarland, Oskar Lafontaine. He then formed his fourth cabinet.

After the federal elections of 1994 Kohl was reelected with a somewhat reduced majority, defeating Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Rudolf Scharping. The SPD was able to win a majority in the Bundesrat, which significantly limited Kohl&#x27;s power. In foreign politics, Kohl was more successful, for instance getting Frankfurt am Main as the seat for the European Central Bank. In 1997, Kohl received the Vision for Europe Award for his efforts in the unification of Europe.

By the late 1990s, Kohl&#x27;s popularity had dropped amid rising unemployment. He was defeated by a large margin in the 1998 federal elections by the Minister-President of Lower Saxony, Gerhard Schröder.

The future Chancellor Angela Merkel started her political career as Kohl&#x27;s protégée and was known in the 1990s as &quot;Kohl&#x27;s girl&quot;; in January 1991, he lifted the then little-known Merkel to national prominence by appointing her to the federal cabinet.

== Retirement ==
A red–green coalition government led by Schröder replaced Kohl&#x27;s government on 27 October 1998. He immediately resigned as CDU leader and largely retired from politics. He remained a member of the Bundestag until he decided not to run for reelection in the 2002 election.

=== CDU finance affair, 1999–2000 ===
Kohl&#x27;s life after political office in the beginning was dominated by the CDU donations scandal. The party financing scandal became public in 1999 when it was discovered that the CDU had received and kept illegal donations during Kohl&#x27;s leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spiegel(08/07/2009)&quot;&gt;Gerd Langguth, &quot;The scandal that helped Merkel become chancellor&quot;, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, 8 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; reported, &quot;It was never suggested that Kohl benefited personally from political donations – but he did lead the party financial system outside of the legal boundaries, doing such things as opening secret bank accounts and establishing civic associations that could act as middlemen, or procurement agencies, for campaign donations.&quot; While his reputation in Germany suffered in the immediate years after the finance affair, it did not affect his reputation internationally; outside of Germany he was perceived as a great European statesman and remembered for his role in solving the five great problems of his era: German reunification, European integration, the relations with Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union and the Bosnian War.

=== Life after politics ===

In 2002, Kohl left the Bundestag and officially retired from politics. Later, he was largely rehabilitated by his party. After taking office, Angela Merkel invited her former patron to the Chancellor&#x27;s Office and Ronald Pofalla, the Secretary-General of the CDU, announced that the CDU would cooperate more closely with Kohl, &quot;to take advantage of the experience of this great statesman&quot;. On 4 March 2004, he published the first of his memoirs, called &quot;Memories 1930–1982&quot;, covering the period from 1930 to 1982, when he became chancellor. The second part, published on 3 November 2005, included the first half of his chancellorship (1982–90). On 28 December 2004, he was air-lifted by the Sri Lankan Air Force, after having been stranded in a hotel by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Kohl was a member of the Club of Madrid.

As reported in the German press, he also gave his name to the &quot;Helmut Kohl Centre for European Studies&quot; (currently &quot;Centre for European Studies&quot;), which is the new political foundation of the European People&#x27;s Party. In late February 2008, Kohl suffered a stroke in combination with a fall which caused serious head injuries and required his hospitalisation, after which he was reported to be using a wheelchair due to partial paralysis and having difficulty speaking. He remained in intensive care since, marrying his 43-year-old partner, Maike Richter, on 8 May 2008, while still in hospital. In 2010, he had a gall bladder operation in Heidelberg, and heart surgery in 2012. He was reportedly in &quot;critical condition&quot; in June 2015, following intestinal surgery following a hip-replacement procedure.
In 2011, Kohl, despite frail health, began giving a number of interviews and issued statements in which he sharply condemned his successor Angela Merkel, whom he had formerly mentored, on her policies in favour of strict austerity in the European debt crisis and later also towards Russia in the Russo-Ukrainian War, which he saw as opposed to his politics of peaceful bi-lateral European integration during his time as chancellor. He published the book &quot;Aus Sorge um Europa&quot; (&quot;Out of Concern for Europe&quot;) outlining these criticisms of Merkel (while also attacking his immediate successor Gerhard Schröder&#x27;s Euro policy) and was widely quoted in the press as saying, &quot;&quot; (&quot;That woman is destroying my Europe&quot;). Kohl thus joined former German chancellors Gerhard Schröder and Helmut Schmidt in their similar criticisms of Merkel&#x27;s policies in these two fields. In 2011, he also criticised Merkel for committing to nuclear power phaseout by 2022, following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, saying that a nuclear phase-out would &quot;make the world a more dangerous place&quot;, that risks are a part of life and Germany should instead focus on &quot;taking precautionary measures and minimizing risks&quot;.

On 19 April 2016, Kohl was visited in his Oggersheim residence by Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán. The two had a one-hour conversation and released a joint press statement regarding the 2015 European migrant crisis, saying they doubted that Europe was capable of continuing to absorb refugees indefinitely. Before the meeting, it had widely been interpreted as criticism of Angela Merkel&#x27;s handling of the crisis, but Kohl and Orbán refrained from attacking the chancellor directly, writing: &quot;It is about a good future for Europe and peace in the world. The efforts of Merkel point in the same direction.&quot;

In 2016, Kohl sued Random House, his former ghost writer Heribert Schwan and co-author Tilman Jens for publishing without his consent 116 comments allegedly made by Kohl during interviews in 2001 and 2002 and published in an unauthorised biography in 2014 called &quot;Legacy: The Kohl Protocols&quot;. By April 2017, a German court ordered publisher Random House and the two journalists to pay Kohl damages of 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for violating his privacy, making it the highest judgment ever rendered for violations of privacy rights under German law.

== Political views ==

Kohl was committed to European integration, maintaining close relations with French president François Mitterrand. Parallel to this, he was committed to German reunification. Although he continued the &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; of his social democratic predecessors, Kohl supported Reagan&#x27;s more aggressive policies to weaken the Soviet Union. He had a strained relationship with British prime minister and fellow conservative Margaret Thatcher, although Kohl did allow her secret access to his plans on reunification in March 1990, to allay the concerns she shared with Mitterrand.

== Personality and media portrayals ==

Kohl faced stiff opposition from the West German political left and was mocked for his large physical stature, alleged provinciality, simplistic language, and (slight) local Palatinate dialect including hypercorrections. Similar to historical French cartoons of Louis-Philippe of France, Hans Traxler depicted Kohl as a pear in the left-leaning satirical journal &quot;Titanic&quot;. The German word &quot;Birne&quot; (&quot;pear&quot;) became a widespread nickname for and symbol of the chancellor.

Comedians like Thomas Freitag and Stefan Wald imitated the chancellor, and books were sold with jokes rewritten with Kohl as the stupid protagonist. When Kohl died, left-wing newspaper TAZ presented a title page showing a flower set typical for funerals, with a pear and the caption &quot;flourishing landscapes&quot;, Kohl&#x27;s prediction for the future of East Germany after reunification. Following protests the editor-in-chief apologised.

The minister-president of Rhineland-Palatinate (1969–1976) was a young reformer in a somewhat backward state and a newcomer who heavily criticised the older party leaders. The national media, for as much as they took notice of him, regarded him with curiosity. But this changed when Kohl became chair of the federal party in 1973, and even more dramatically when in late 1975 his party made him a candidate for the chancellery. His opponents within the federal party, but also journalists and other observers, had their doubts whether the parochial, though successful moderniser of a manageable smaller state was the right person to lead the Federal Republic, a big and complicated industrial country.

Biographer Hans Peter Schwarz names five problems of the 46-year-old candidate: being unfamiliar with the complicated relations in the Bundestag group, having no international experience, having no profound knowledge of economics, but also: a lack of charisma and no cultural acceptance in Northern Germany.

In small circles Kohl was fascinating and a perfect host; the larger the crowd, the vaguer, weaker and paler he appeared. His gaze into the TV cameras made him look helpless. When attacked, e.g. in election campaigns, he became a good fighter. But in general, he was no great orator, his speeches were lengthy and verbose, according to Schwarz. Additionally, the Catholic with his Palatinate dialect, a folksy man who had culture but was no intellectual – to North German journalists (like from the important newspapers made in Hamburg, including weeklies &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; and &quot;Die Zeit&quot;) he just felt foreign, more than any previous CDU chairman.

Unlike many politicians of his era, including predecessors Helmut Schmidt and Willy Brandt, successor Gerhard Schröder or rival Franz Josef Strauss, Kohl was never regarded as charismatic or media-savvy and many of his peculiar coinings were heavily lampooned and criticised. Nonetheless, many of them have entered the general lexicon despite or perhaps because of attempts by his opponents to mock them. Examples of &quot;Kohlisms&quot; that have gained some currency include his description of the 1982 change in government as (&quot;spiritual and moral turnaround&quot;) or the &quot;Grace of late birth&quot; () meaning that Kohl, born in 1930, was only involved in the war as a Flakhelfer and escaped the possibility of involvement in Nazi atrocities by virtue of being too young at the time. Another frequently mocked turn of phrase by Kohl was his prediction the New States of Germany would soon turn into (&quot;flowering landscapes&quot;) with some cynics pointing out that former industrial sites were indeed turning into flowering meadows in the course of ecological succession as a consequence of deindustrialisation.

Kohl was a true „people person“ and loved to be in the company of others. His tremendous memory of people and their lives helped him to build up his networks in the Christian Democratic Union, in government and abroad. In a study of German chancellorship as political leadership, Henrik Gast highlights how much time Kohl invested in personal relationships even with the backbenchers in the Bundestag and also party officials up to the local level. This worked because it fitted Kohl&#x27;s character and was authentic.

Kohl knew that all these people were the basis of his political power and that he needed their loyalty and personal affection. He could also be rude to subordinates and assistants, and confront political adversaries. &quot;He was capable of both – being empathetic and being extremely confrontational! If you did not do what he wanted, empathy was over!&quot;, as Gast quotes a federal minister of Kohl&#x27;s own party. There was also a difference between the younger Kohl and the chancellor in his later years. A parliamentary state secretary recalled: &quot;A sense of tact and politeness? The early and the later Kohl – that was a tremendous difference. In the early years, he had all of that, in the later years no more.&quot;

==Personal life==

===Family===
On 27 June 1960, Kohl married Hannelore Renner, after he had already asked for her hand in marriage in 1953, delaying the ceremony until he was financially stable. Both had known each other since 1948 when they met in a dancing class. They had two sons, Walter Kohl (born 1963) and Peter Kohl (born 1965). Hannelore Kohl had studied languages and spoke fluent French and English; during her husband&#x27;s political career, she was an important adviser to him, especially on world affairs. She was a steadfast advocate of German reunification even before it seemed feasible and of NATO and Germany&#x27;s alliance with the United States. They shared a love for German food: his commentary enhanced the cookbook &quot;A Culinary Voyage Through Germany&quot; that she edited.

Both sons were educated in the United States, at Harvard University and MIT, respectively. Walter Kohl worked as a financial analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York City and later founded a consulting firm with his father in 1999. Peter Kohl worked as an investment banker in London for many years. Walter Kohl was formerly married to the business administration academic Christine Volkmann and they have a son, Johannes Volkmann; he is now married to the Korean-born Kyung-Sook Kohl née Hwang. Peter Kohl is married to the Turkish-born investment banker Elif Sözen-Kohl, the daughter of a wealthy Turkish industrialist, and they have a daughter, Leyla Kohl (born 2002).

On 5 July 2001, his wife, Hannelore, died by suicide; she had suffered from photodermatitis for many years.



===Second marriage, 2008–2017===

While in hospital in 2008 after suffering serious head trauma, Kohl, then aged 78, married Maike Richter, a former Chancellery employee who was 44 years old; they had no children. For the entire duration of this marriage, Kohl had a brain injury, was barely able to speak, and was wheelchair-bound. According to Helmut Kohl&#x27;s son Peter Kohl, Helmut Kohl did not intend to marry Richter and had stated this clearly; &quot;then came the accident and a loss of control,&quot; Peter Kohl said, suggesting that Richter had pressured his then seriously ill father into marrying her. Richter has been severely criticised in Germany, by Kohl&#x27;s children, former friends and by German media. Following his new marriage, Kohl became estranged from his two sons and his grandchildren, and his sons said their father was kept &quot;like a prisoner&quot; by his new wife. His children and grandchildren were also prevented from seeing him by his new wife for the last six years of his life. In his biography of his mother, Peter Kohl wrote about the only time he had visited Richter&#x27;s apartment, which he described as &quot;a kind of private Helmut Kohl museum&quot; full of Helmut Kohl photographs and artefacts everywhere; &quot;the whole thing looked like the result of a staggering, meticulous collecting for the purpose of hero worship, as we know it from reports on stalkers,&quot; Kohl wrote. Jochen Arntz criticised Maike Richter in the &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; in 2012 for building a &quot;wall&quot; around Helmut Kohl and controlling him; as a result he had also become estranged from many former friends disliked by his new wife. Kohl biographer Heribert Schwan describes Richter as &quot;more than conservative, rather German nationalist,&quot; and said she insists on the right to &quot;interpretational sovereignty&quot; in relation to Kohl&#x27;s life and that she has insisted on many proven falsehoods. It caused a scandal when Richter denied Kohl&#x27;s sons and grandchildren entry to Helmut Kohl&#x27;s house, the sons&#x27; childhood home, after Kohl&#x27;s death. Richter was also criticised for attempting to take full control of Kohl&#x27;s funeral, and for trying to prevent Chancellor Merkel from speaking at the ceremony in Strasbourg. Richter wanted Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, who has fiercely criticised Merkel&#x27;s refugee policies, to speak instead; she only relented when told it would cause a scandal.

== Honours and awards ==

Helmut Kohl received numerous awards and accolades, as well as honorary titles such as doctorates and citizenships. Among others, he was a joint recipient of the Charlemagne Prize with French president François Mitterrand for their contribution to Franco-German friendship and the European Union. In 1996, Kohl received the Prince of Asturias Award in International Cooperation from Felipe of Spain. In 1998, Kohl was named Honorary Citizen of Europe by the European heads of state or government for his extraordinary work for European integration and cooperation, an honour previously only bestowed on Jean Monnet. After leaving office in 1998, Kohl became the second person after Konrad Adenauer to receive the Grand Cross in Special Design of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton in 1999.

== Death, European act of state and funeral ==

Kohl died at 9:15 a.m. on Friday, 16 June 2017 in the Oggersheim district of Ludwigshafen, his hometown, aged 87 of natural causes.

Kohl was honoured with an unprecedented European act of state on 1 July in Strasbourg, France. A Catholic requiem mass was subsequently celebrated in Speyer Cathedral. Kohl was interred in the Cathedral Chapter Cemetery (&quot;&quot;) in Speyer, directly adjacent to the Konrad Adenauer Park and a few hundred metres to the northwest of the cathedral. It was reported that Kohl had himself chosen the burial location in the late summer of 2015 when his health began to deteriorate.

No member of the Kohl family—Kohl&#x27;s children and grandchildren—participated in any of the ceremonies, owing to a feud with Kohl&#x27;s controversial second wife Maike Kohl-Richter, who had among other things barred them from paying their respects to him at his house, ignored their wish for a ceremony in Berlin and their wish that Kohl should be interred alongside his parents and his wife of four decades Hannelore Kohl in the family tomb.

=== Tributes ===
Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking from the German Embassy in Rome, said that &quot;this man who was great in every sense of the word—his achievement, his role as a statesman in Germany at its historical moment—it&#x27;s going to take a while until we can truly assess what we have lost in his passing.&quot; She lauded Kohl&#x27;s &quot;supreme art of statesmanship in the service of people and peace&quot; and noted that Kohl had also changed her own life decisively.

Pope Francis lauded Kohl as &quot;a great statesman and committed European [who] worked with farsightedness and devotion for the good of the people in Germany and in neighbouring European countries.&quot;

The 14th Dalai Lama praised Kohl as &quot;a visionary leader and statesman&quot; and said he had &quot;great admiration for Chancellor Kohl&#x27;s steady leadership when the Cold War came to a peaceful end and the reunification of Germany became possible.&quot;

Flags were flown at half-staff at the European Commission headquarters in Brussels. Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker lauded Kohl as &quot;a great European.&quot; He called Kohl &quot;my mentor, my friend, the very essence of Europe.&quot; The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, called Kohl &quot;a friend and a statesman, who helped to reunify Europe.&quot;

Former US president George H. W. Bush lauded Kohl as &quot;a true friend of freedom&quot; and &quot;one of the greatest leaders in post-War Europe.&quot; Former US president Bill Clinton said he was &quot;deeply saddened&quot; by the death of &quot;my dear friend&quot; whose &quot;visionary leadership prepared Germany and all of Europe for the 21st century.&quot; US president Donald Trump said Kohl was &quot;a friend and ally to the United States&quot; and that &quot;he was not only the father of German reunification, but also an advocate for Europe and the transatlantic relationship. The world has benefited from his vision and efforts. His legacy will live on.&quot; Former US secretary of state James Baker said Kohl&#x27;s death meant &quot;Germany has lost one of its greatest leaders, the United States has lost one of its best friends and the world has lost a ringing voice for freedom,&quot; and that Kohl &quot;more than anyone at the end of the Cold War [...] was the architect of the reunification of Germany&quot; which had &quot;brought freedom to millions and has helped make Europe safer and more prosperous.&quot;

French president Emmanuel Macron called Kohl a &quot;great European&quot; and &quot;an architect of united Germany and Franco-German friendship.&quot; Belgian prime minister Charles Michel called Kohl &quot;a true European&quot; who &quot;will be greatly missed.&quot; Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said Kohl was &quot;a great statesman&quot; who had shaped European history. Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy lauded Kohl&#x27;s role in European history and in the German reunification. Polish prime minister Beata Szydło called Kohl &quot;an outstanding figure and statesman, a great politician in exceptional times&quot;. Italian president Sergio Mattarella called Kohl one of Europe&#x27;s founding fathers, and said that &quot;he who was, rightly, described as &#x27;the Chancellor of Reunification&#x27;, worked with far-sightedness and determination, in years marked by deep and epochal changes in world equilibria, to give back unity to his country in the framework of the great project of European integration. As an authentic statesman, he knew how to combine pragmatism and a capacity of vision, furnishing a courageous contribution not only to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany, but also to overcoming the dramatic divisions which, for decades, had torn Europe.&quot; Former Italian prime minister and President of the European Commission Romano Prodi called Kohl &quot;a giant of a united Europe.&quot; Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán called Kohl the &quot;great old man&quot; of European politics and &quot;Hungary&#x27;s friend&quot;.

Former British prime minister John Major said Kohl was &quot;a towering figure in German and European history&quot; who &quot;entrenched Germany in a wider Europe, in the hope of achieving a unity and peace that the continent had never known before. This required great political strength and courage – both of which qualities Helmut had in abundance.&quot; British prime minister Theresa May called Kohl &quot;a giant of European history&quot; and said that &quot;I pay tribute to the role he played in helping to end the Cold War and reunify Germany. We have lost the father of modern Germany.&quot;

Former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev said that &quot;it was real luck that at that difficult time [1989–1990] leading nations were headed by statesmen with a sense of responsibility, adamant about defending the interests of their countries but also able to consider the interests of others, able to overcome the barrier of prevailing suspicion about partnership and mutual trust. The name of this outstanding German politician will stay in the memory of his compatriots and all Europeans.&quot; Russian president Vladimir Putin said &quot;I was lucky to know Helmut Kohl in person. I profoundly admired his wisdom and the ability to make well-considered, far-reaching decisions even in the most difficult situations.&quot; He called Kohl a &quot;highly reputed statesman, one of the patriarchs of European and world politics.&quot;

NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said Kohl was &quot;a true European&quot; and the &quot;embodiment of a united Germany in a united Europe.&quot; UN secretary-general António Guterres said Kohl had &quot;played an instrumental role in the peaceful reunification of his country&quot; and that &quot;today&#x27;s Europe is a product of his vision and his tenacity, in the face of enormous obstacles.&quot;

<doc id="41901" wikidata="Q2516" url="?curid=41901" title="Helmut Schmidt">
<text>Helmut Heinrich Waldemar Schmidt (; 23 December 1918 – 10 November 2015) was a German politician and member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), who served as the chancellor of West Germany from 1974 to 1982.

Before becoming chancellor, he served as the minister of defence (1969–1972) and the minister of finance (1972–1974) in the government of Willy Brandt. In the latter role he gained credit for his financial policies. He had also briefly been minister of economics and acting foreign minister.

As chancellor, he focused on international affairs, seeking &quot;political unification of Europe in partnership with the United States&quot; amidst the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and issuing proposals that led to the NATO Double-Track Decision in 1979 to deploy U.S. Pershing II missiles to Europe. He was an energetic diplomat who sought European co-operation and international economic co-ordination and was the leading force in creating the European Monetary System in 1978. He was re-elected chancellor in 1976 and 1980, but his coalition fell apart in 1982 with the switch by his coalition allies, the Free Democratic Party.

He retired from Parliament in 1986, after clashing with the SPD&#x27;s left-wing, which opposed him on defence and economic issues. In 1986, he was a leading proponent of European monetary union and a European Central Bank.

== Background, family, early life and education ==
Helmut Schmidt was the elder of two sons to Ludovica Koch (10 November 1890 – 29 November 1968) and Gustav Ludwig Schmidt (18 April 1888 – 26 March 1981) in Barmbek, a working-class district of Hamburg, in 1918. Schmidt studied at Hamburg Lichtwark School, graduating in 1937. Schmidt&#x27;s father was born the biological son of a German Jewish banker, Ludwig Gumpel, and a Christian waitress, Friederike Wenzel, and then covertly adopted, although this was kept a family secret for many years. This was confirmed publicly by Schmidt in 1984, after Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing revealed the fact to journalists, apparently with Schmidt&#x27;s assent. Helmut Schmidt was a non-practising Protestant.

Schmidt was a group leader (Scharführer) in the Hitler Youth organisation until 1936, when he was demoted and sent on leave because of his anti-Nazi views. However, documents from 1942 praise his &quot;Impeccable national socialist [Nazi] behaviour&quot;, and in 1944 his superiors mentioned that Schmidt &quot;stands the ground of national socialist ideology, knowing that he must pass it on.&quot; On 27 June 1942, he married his childhood sweetheart Hannelore &quot;Loki&quot; Glaser (3 March 1919 – 21 October 2010). They had two children: Helmut Walter (26 June 1944 – 19 February 1945, died of meningitis), and (born 8 May 1947), who works in London for Bloomberg Television. Schmidt resumed his education in Hamburg after the war, graduating in economics and political science in 1949.

== Military service ==
Schmidt had planned to study without interruption. Therefore, he volunteered at age 18 for military service in 1937. He began serving with an anti-aircraft battery of Luftwaffe at Vegesack near Bremen.

In World War II, after brief service on the Eastern Front during the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 (including the Siege of Leningrad), he returned to Germany in 1942 to work as a trainer and advisor at the Ministry of Aviation. During his service in World War II, Schmidt was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class.

He attended the People&#x27;s Court as a military spectator at some of the show trials for officers involved in the 20 July plot, in which an unsuccessful attempt was made to assassinate Hitler at Rastenburg, and was disgusted by Judge Roland Freisler&#x27;s conduct.

Toward the end of the war, from December 1944 onwards, he served as an Oberleutnant in the Flak artillery on the Western Front during the Battle of the Bulge and the Ardennes Offensive. He was captured by the British in April 1945 on Lüneburg Heath, and was a prisoner of war until August of that year in Belgium. In 1958 Schmidt was promoted to Hauptmann of the Bundeswehr reserve.

==Post-WWII==
Schmidt joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1946, and from 1947 to 1948 was the leader of the Socialist German Student League, the student organisation of the SPD. Upon graduating from the University of Hamburg, where he read economics, he worked for the government of the city-state of Hamburg, working in the department of Economic Policy. Beginning in 1952, under Karl Schiller, he was a senior figure heading up the (the Hamburg State Ministry for Economy and Transport).

He was elected to the &quot;Bundestag&quot; in 1953, and in 1957 he became a member of the SPD parliamentary party executive. A vocal critic of conservative government policy, his outspoken rhetoric in parliament earned him the nickname (&quot;Schmidt the Lip&quot;). In 1958, he joined the national board of the SPD (), and campaigned against nuclear weapons and the equipping of the Bundeswehr with such devices. He alarmed some in his party by taking part in manoeuvres as a reserve officer in the newly formed Bundeswehr. In 1962, he gave up his seat in parliament to concentrate on his tasks in Hamburg.

== Senator ==
The government of the city-state of Hamburg is known as the Senate of Hamburg, and from 1961 to 1965, Schmidt was the : the senator of the interior. He gained a reputation as a – someone who gets things done regardless of obstacles – by his effective management during the emergency caused by the 1962 flood, during which 300 people drowned. Schmidt used all means at his disposal to alleviate the situation, even when that meant overstepping his legal authority, including employing the federal police and army units (ignoring the German constitution&#x27;s prohibition on using the army for &quot;internal affairs&quot;; a clause excluding disasters was not added until 1968). Describing his actions, Schmidt said, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t put in charge of these units – I took charge of them!&quot; He saved a further 1,000 lives and swiftly managed the re-housing of thousands of the homeless.

== Return to federal politics ==
In 1965, he was re-elected to the Bundestag. In 1967, after the formation of the Grand Coalition between the SPD and the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), he became chairman of the Social Democratic parliamentary party, a post he held until the elections of 1969. In 1968, he was elected deputy party chairman, a post that he held until 1983. Unlike Willy Brandt and Gerhard Schröder, he never became chairman of the party.

In October 1969, he entered the government of Willy Brandt as defense minister. During his term in office, the military conscription time was reduced from 18 to 15 months, while at the same time increasing the number of young men being conscripted. Additionally, Schmidt decided to introduce the Bundeswehr universities in Hamburg and Munich to broaden the academic education of the German officer corps, and the situation of non-commissioned officers was improved. In July 1972, he succeeded Karl Schiller as Minister for Economics and Finance, but in November 1972, he relinquished the Economics department, which was again made a separate ministry. Schmidt remained Minister of Finance and faced the prospect of rising inflation. Shortly before the Oil Shock of 1973, which rattled Britain and United States, Schmidt agreed that European currencies should be floated against the US Dollar. He remained in charge of finance until May 1974.

== Chancellor of Germany, 1974–1982 ==

Schmidt became Chancellor of West Germany on 16 May 1974, after Brandt&#x27;s resignation in the wake of an espionage scandal. The worldwide economic recession was the main problem his administration faced, and Schmidt took a tough and disciplined line, in reduction of public spending. Schmidt was also active in improving relations with France. Together with the French President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, he was one of the fathers of the world economic summits, the first of which assembled in 1975. In 1975, he was a signatory of the Helsinki Accords to create the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the precursor of today&#x27;s OSCE. In 1978, he helped set up the European Monetary System (EMS).

He remained as Chancellor after the 1976 federal election, in coalition with the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP). He adopted a tough, uncompromising line with the indigenous Red Army Faction (RAF) extremists. In October 1977, he ordered an anti-terrorist unit of Bundesgrenzschutz policemen to end the Palestinian terrorist hijacking of a Lufthansa aircraft named &quot;Landshut&quot;, staged to secure the release of imprisoned RAF leaders, after it landed in Mogadishu, Somalia. Three of the four kidnappers were killed during the assault on the plane, but all 86 passengers were rescued unharmed.

Schmidt was re-elected as Chancellor in November 1980. Concerned about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the Soviet superiority regarding missiles in Central Europe, Schmidt issued proposals resulting in the NATO Double-Track Decision, concerning the deployment of medium-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe, should the Soviets not disarm. This decision was unpopular with the German public. A mass demonstration against the deployment mobilised 400,000 people in October 1981.

At the beginning of his period as chancellor, Schmidt was a proponent of Keynesian economics, and pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies during his tenure. Between 1979 and 1982, the Schmidt administration pursued such policies in an effort to reduce unemployment. These were moderately successful, as the fiscal measures introduced after 1977, with reductions in income and wealth taxes and an increase in the medium-term public investment programme, were estimated to have created 160,000 additional jobs in 1978–79, or 300,000 if additional public sector employment was included in the figure. The small reduction in the unemployment rate, however, was achieved at the cost of a larger budget deficit (which rose from 31.2 billion DM to 75.7 billion DM in 1981), brought about by fiscal expansion.

During the 1970s, West Germany was able to weather the global financial storm far better than almost all the other developed countries, with unemployment and inflation kept at comparatively low levels. During the 1976 election campaign, the SPD/FDP coalition was able to win the battle of statistics, whether the figures related to employees&#x27; incomes, strikes, unemployment, growth, or public sector debts. Amongst other social improvements, old age pensions had been doubled between 1969 and 1976, and unemployment benefits increased to 68% of previous earnings.

Whilst visiting Saudi Arabia in April 1981, Schmidt made some unguarded remarks about the Israel-Palestine conflict that succeeded in aggravating the delicate relations between Israel and West Germany. Asked by a reporter about the moral aspect of German-Israeli relations, he stated that Israel was not in a position to criticise Germany due to its handling of Palestinians, and &quot;That won&#x27;t do. And in particular, it won&#x27;t do for a German living in a divided nation and laying moral claim to the right of self-determination for the German people. One must then recognize the moral claim of the Palestinian people to the right of self-determination.&quot; On 3 May, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin denounced Schmidt as &quot;unprincipled, avaricious, heartless, and lacking in human feeling&quot;, and stated that he had &quot;willingly served in the German armies that murdered millions.&quot; Begin was also upset over remarks that Schmidt had made on West German television the previous week, in which he spoke apologetically about the suffering Germany inflicted on various nations during World War II; but made no mention of the Jews. On his flight home from Riyadh, Schmidt told his advisers that war guilt could not continue to affect Germany&#x27;s foreign relations.

Schmidt was the first world leader to call upon newly elected French president François Mitterrand, who visited Bonn in July 1981. The two found themselves in &quot;complete agreement&quot; on foreign policy matters and relations with the United States and the Soviet Union, but differed on trade and economic issues.

By the end of his term, however, Schmidt had turned away from deficit spending, due to a deteriorating economic situation, and a number of welfare cuts were carried out, including smaller increases in child benefits and higher unemployment and health contributions. Large sections of the SPD increasingly opposed his security policy, while most of the FDP politicians strongly supported that policy. While representatives of the left-wing of the Social Democratic Party opposed reduction of the state expenditures, the FDP began proposing a monetarist economic policy. In February 1982, Schmidt won a motion of confidence; however on 17 September 1982, the coalition broke apart, with the four FDP ministers leaving his cabinet. Schmidt continued to lead a minority government composed only of SPD members, while the FDP negotiated a coalition with the CDU/CSU. During this time, Schmidt also headed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 1 October 1982, the FDP supported a CDU-proposed constructive vote of no confidence, ousting Schmidt in favour of CDU chairman Helmut Kohl as the new chancellor. This was the only time in the history of the Federal Republic that a chancellor was removed from office in this way.

=== Domestic reforms ===

Although Schmidt did not feel that he was in a position to substantially extend the social reforms of the Brandt Administration, due to the economic problems he encountered during his time as chancellor, a wide range of reforms were nevertheless carried out under his administration. Increases were made to pensions, which went up in numerical terms. Adjusted for changes in the annual price index, pensions went up in real terms. However the rate of pension was not changed in 1978 (even though prices increased by 2.7%), and in 1980 and 1981 the real value of pensions fell by 1.5% and 2.3%, respectively. Improvements were made in family allowances, with monthly subsidies for children increased by over 100% in 1975.

Improvements were made to invalidity and old-age pension provision for the unemployed, who (from 1977 onwards) were technically insured free of charge under the old-age pension and invalidity scheme. Previously, there had only existed partial and restricted coverage for the unemployed. The Law to Improve Occupational Old Age Pensions (1974) extended coverage of occupational pensions, whilst also &quot;co-ordinating them more closely with state pensions and setting minimum standards as regards benefit levels and the preservation of pension rights&quot;. By 1976, as a result of this legislation, 65% of private sector employees were covered by occupational schemes, and over two-thirds of these workers were eligible for benefits equal to more than 15% of their earnings at retirement. This legislation also acquired that entitlements to occupational pensions must not expire after leaving a firm, and that occupational pensions must not be reduced as a result of receipt of benefits under the public insurance system. The Social Insurance Law for the Handicapped (1975) extended compulsory coverage to disabled persons working in special establishments for the disabled (medical benefits and cash benefits to replace earnings from work). In 1976, a new declaration of social rights was made, and in 1979, an Act was passed which lowered the pensionable age for severely disabled persons to 61 years, and to 60 years as from 1980.

In October 1974, a Rehabilitation Benefits Alignment Act was passed, with the intention of promoting rehabilitation of the disabled by extending certain benefits to them. To meet the need for more uniform medical treatment in rural areas and on the peripheral of cities due to a lack of panel doctors in those areas, a bill was passed in December 1976 which improved the possibilities of panel doctors&#x27; associations by ensuring that panel doctors were available to provide treatment, while also providing for planning according to need and the participation of the sickness insurances. An Act of August 1975 on criminal law reform introduced &quot;other forms of assistance&quot; such as medical advice on contraception, together with assistance pertaining to sterilisation and abortion. New assistance benefits were created in 1975 for family planning and maternity consultations, whilst a constant attendance allowance was increased. Housing renovation and energy savings legislation was introduced in 1977, while a constitutional reform of 1981 increased federal powers in health and education.

In July 1974, special benefits were introduced to compensate for wages not paid as a result of bankruptcy for a maximum of up to three months. Increases in income-limits for housing allowances were carried out, together with housing allowance rates, while major improvements were made in welfare provision for the elderly. By 1982, the purchasing power of the average pension was 2.5% better than in 1975. In 1975, tax allowances were replaced by child benefits, while payment for the first child was introduced. A tax relief act reduced income taxes and provided additional tax benefits for housing allowances. The Schmidt administration also introduced social policy legislation in the late 1970s, which increased family allowances (though by a smaller amount than in 1974) and maternity leave benefits. The increases in benefits under the Schmidt administration arguably had a positive impact on reducing inequalities, with the percentage of West Germans living in poverty (according to one measurement) falling between 1978 and 1982.

Under the law of June 1974, the residents could participate in the management of the establishment through a consultative committee. A law of June 1975 amended the Employment Protection Law and the Law on the provision of temporary workers which improved the legal protection of temporary migrants workers in West Germany. A law of December 1975 gave the right to claim under the sickness insurance scheme for medical consultations for family planning purposes. A law of May 1975 extended social security to disabled persons according to various procedures.

A law of April 1976 on youth employment limited working hours to 40 hours in a 5-day week, raised the minimum working age from 14 to 15, increased leave, improved conditions for release from work for day attendance at vocational training school and for periods of weeks under the block release system, and improved protection at work by restrictions on employment in dangerous or unhealthy work. A law on protection against dismissal was amended by abolishing the minimum age limit of 18, so that young workers under eighteen were now also protected against dismissal. The Ministry for Youth, Family Affairs and Health encouraged a pilot scheme, of a scientific nature, aimed at promoting the development of qualified advisory services on family planning, sexual problems and problems linked with pregnancy. A regulation of June 1976 laid down detailed rules governing &#x27;aid to overcome particular social difficulties&#x27;. This measure was specially aimed at marginal social groups, such as former convicts and the homeless, and consisted of providing information, personal guidance, help in obtaining and maintaining a home and in obtaining and keeping a job, in addition to guidance as regards training and the organization of leisure time. The general section of the Social Code, which came into effect in January 1976, introduced basic measures concerning the social services. It laid down an obligation to establish the services and institutions needed by the population and to provide them with information and advice on their social rights. These provisions had already had certain effects, in particular a considerable growth in home help services and social centres. A regulation in application of a 1974 law on old people&#x27;s homes and adult hostels was introduced, according to which compulsory consultative committees could be set up by the residents to ensure their participation in the running of these establishments in a greater measure than in the past. A law passed in August 1974 supplemented the protection provided for handicapped people under a law passed during the Brandt Administration in April 1974 by providing that, henceforth, the benefits for the purposes of medical and occupational rehabilitation would be the same for all the categories of persons concerned: war victims, the sick, the victims of industrial accidents, congenitally handicapped persons: a total of about 4 million persons in all.

The 1976 Act for the Promotion of Urban Development and the 1977 Housing Modernisation Act, together with the 1971 Act for the Promotion of Urban Development passed by the Brandt Administration, enabled most West German cities by the end of the Seventies to introduce programmes aimed at renovating their pre-war residential areas. Additional tax reforms were introduced that lowered the tax burden on low-income households, and which played an important role &quot;in pre-empting a real decline in the income and purchasing power of workers&quot;. A law was passed to encourage low-income home ownership, while 250 million marks was provided in 1978 for the promotion of sports and physical education. That same year, entitlement to educational allowances was extended to all tenth-grade pupils in vocational education.

The Introductory Tax Reform Law (1974) increased bad weather payments, part-time workers&#x27; benefits and insurance benefits to 68% of net wages, fixed special benefits during vocational training at 90% of net earnings, increased assistance benefits to 58% of net earnings, and abolished special family benefits &quot;in favour of the inclusion of the unemployed under general child allowance scheme&quot;. A special tax credit was introduced in 1978 in cases of particular financial burden due to children, while a substantial increase in the child allowance was made in 1979. Several policy changes were carried out between 1976 and 1982, such as tax credits and family allowances, which compensated unions for wage restraint and &quot;guaranteed the maintenance of a constant income level for employed persons and their families&quot;. Increases were made in child benefits, which rose on a regular basis (particularly for families with more than one child) for most of the years that the Schmidt Administration was in office.

Various measures were also carried out to mitigate the effects of unemployment. Employment creation schemes were introduced to help young workers. The Training Opportunities Act (1976) helped (over a four-year period) to increase the number of vocational training places from 450,000 to 630,000 a year. In 1976, a provisional law was introduced to boost the number of apprentices, which reduced the numbers of young people out of work. An experimental retraining programme was launched on the shop floor (lasting from 1979 to 1981), which benefited 45,680 people.

In June 1974, a reformed food law was passed into law, which aimed to safeguard consumers from physical harm. The Students&#x27; Sickness Insurance Law (1975) extended compulsory coverage to students (medical benefits only), while the Artists&#x27; Social Insurance Law (1981) introduced compulsory insurance for artists below a certain income-limit. The Detergents Law (1975) and the Effluency Levies Act (1978) were passed to encourage environmental protection. In 1975, the allowable duration of unemployment benefit payment was extended to twenty-four months during periods of general recession. The 1976 law on standard terms of sale gave consumer groups the right to file suits against companies employing unfair terms of sale. The Higher Education Framework Act of 1976 pronounced that scientific continuing education was a task to be implemented by the institutions of the system of higher education, thus exceeding their traditional tasks of research and lecturing. In 1977, an &quot;investment programme for the future&quot; was decided upon by the Schmidt Administration, which provided DM 16 thousand million for the improvement of the transport system, an efficient and ecological energy supply, provisions for water supply, vocational training, and the safeguarding of the environment.

Under a regulation of December 1976, four new occupational diseases were recognised. To expand training opportunities for girls, a pilot scheme was launched in 1978 to open up certain skilled industrial and technical occupations to them. Laws restricting the access of migrant workers to certain regions were repealed in 1977, and the existing provisions were made more flexible in order to allow the children of migrant workers who had entered the Federal Republic of Germany in 1975/76 access to employment. Legislation governing old people&#x27;s homes and adult assistance establishments was further supplemented by two regulations, one imposing minimum requirements concerning premises, and the other laying down rules for financial management to ensure that residents were not financially exploited.

The Fifth Amendment of July 1979 to the Employment Promotion Law provided among other things for an improvement in conditions governing financial support towards basic vocational training for unemployed young people with at least one year&#x27;s vocational experience, the expansion of training activities for jobs in which there is a shortage of skilled workers and easier access to further vocational training facilities for problem groups (such as the unskilled, the unemployed, and women generally). In 1979, the Federal Minister for Education and Science made funds available for a new further education establishment to train instructors. Under a law amending the law respecting technical working media and the Industrial Code of August 1979, machines and equipment which had been voluntarily submitted for testing and passed by an established body may bear the marking &#x27;GS&#x27; (=safety-tested). For medical equipment, the Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs was authorized to issue orders containing further safety provisions, while the resale of hazardous equipment and its display at exhibitions may be prohibited in future by factory inspectors even in the case of trading companies.

In 1979 DM 219 million was set aside for about 80,000 dwellings under the modernisation programme for dwellings worthy of preservation run jointly by the Federal authorities and the individual (50% of this money was earmarked for modernization priority areas). In addition, DM 2,350 million was made available under a five-year programme to improve the housing stock. Loans and higher tax rebates were also used to encourage modernisation of dwellings and energy-saving measures. 577 slum clearance and urban development schemes in 459 municipalities were also accorded financial support amounting to DM 183.5 million under a law on the promotion of urban development. A law of October 1979 granted a lump-sum allowance for the winter of 1979/80 to help low-income groups to meet the additional outlay incurred by the rise in fuel costs. In August 1979, a programme was adopted for foreign refugees, with resources allocated for aid concerning information, legal advice, psycho-social and medical assistance and for measures to facilitate the integration of refugees or their emigration to other countries.

Under a law of July 1980, a farmer&#x27;s surviving spouse wishing to continue working on the farm could obtain a helper or temporary aid from the agricultural pension fund. Any spouse choosing not to do so was entitled to a survivor&#x27;s allowance if he or she was no longer able to find suitable paid employment either for reasons of age (over 45) or because there were children to bring up. In other cases, the allowance was designed to facilitate reintegration into working life. This allowance guaranteed the spouse protection under the agricultural sickness insurance scheme, which also covered self-employed fishermen and beekeepers.

A special programme was introduced, specially designed for young people who, because of their poor level of education and language ability, were unable to find a suitable job or training place. The young people were offered a one-year full-time course of training to qualify them for a training place or job, and in September 1980, approximately 15,000 young people were participating in these courses. From 1980 onwards, parents could deduct the cost of day care for their children (in day nurseries and nursery schools in particular) from their taxable income up to an annual maximum of DM 600 or DM 1,200 depending on whether the income of a single parent or that of a married couple was involved. Major additions were also made to the regulations on dangerous substances, while comprehensive new regulations concerning installations requiring supervision were introduced. The Federal Ministry for Youth, Family Affairs and Health gave particular attention to assisting parents in assuming their educational responsibilities towards their children. For instance, special &#x27;letters to parents&#x27; were distributed free of charge to parents of children under 8, with some 3 million sent in 1979. A determined effort was also made to provide better education for socially disadvantaged children by supporting pilot schemes and research projects. Public funds had been allocated from 1979 onwards to a pilot scheme entitled &#x27;Aid to children in need&#x27; under which children&#x27;s communities were set up in Berlin and Gütersloh to protect and care for children who had been or were at risk of being ill-treated by their parents, while at the same time the family education and advisory services were assigned the task of educating these parents.

In terms of workplace rights, a &quot;parity&quot; system was introduced (although in a weakened form) on the supervisory boards of all companies employing over 2,000 workers, a reform which West German trade unions had long fought for. This law improved employee representation on the supervisory boards of companies outside the steel and coal industries. The main provision of this new piece of legislation was that in the 650 major companies that accounted for 70% of West Germany&#x27;s output, employee representation on the supervisory boards rose from one-third to one-half. In 1976, the Young Persons (Protection of Employment) Act was passed, which forbade the employment of children and young persons required to attend full-time education, with minor exceptions.

The social protection of civil servants and judges ( and ) was standardised and improved by a law of August 1974. Under a law of May 1976, victims of acts of violence and their survivors would in future have the right to compensation in respect of the physical and economic consequences in the same manner as protection for war victims. In 1977, DM 8 million was made available by the federal government to welfare bodies to build and modernise holiday homes for families. That same year, the conditions for investment in the privately financed construction of rented dwellings were improved by the reintroduction of decreasing depreciation for buildings. In order to take the situation of the unemployed into account to the maximum possible extent in asset formation policy, certain legal provisions were amended so that in the event of unemployment, personal payments could be made to continue savings plans which entailed employers contributions. In addition, workers who had been unemployed for a year or more could unblock savings plans before the end of the freeze without losing the financial benefits offered by the State. A new special programme with funds of DM 100 million was launched at the start of 1978 to improve training and job opportunities for the disabled. The budget of the Federal Labour Office was increased exceptionally by more than 20%, whilst special emphasis was placed on measures to promote vocational training, job creation, advanced training and retraining. The aim was to reduce the high proportion of unemployed persons lacking training and increase the chances of this group to obtain employment.

A wide range of social liberal reforms were also carried out during Schmidt&#x27;s time in office. A marriage and divorce law of 1976 instituted the principle of maintenance obligations of each economically stronger partner, That same year, a reform of naming for partners after marriage was carried out, together with a reform of marriage law, which eliminated &quot;moral guilt&quot; as a criterion for alimony payment obligations. The First Marriage Reform Law of 1976 stated that pension entitlements acquired during marriage must be shared with the economically weaker spouse following divorce. In 1977, a law was introduced which enabled married women to enter employment without the permission of their husbands, while prison reforms guaranteed inmates access to courts for any violations of their rights, limited sentences in all but the gravest cases to 15 years, and proclaimed rehabilitation to be the objective of incarceration. In 1977, a Sex Discrimination Act was passed. In 1981, a legal aid system was established to facilitate access to courts of law.

== Life after politics ==

In 1982, along with his friend Gerald Ford, he co-founded the annual AEI World Forum. The following year he joined the nationwide weekly &quot;Die Zeit&quot; newspaper as co-publisher, also acting as its director from 1985 to 1989. In 1985, he became managing director. With Takeo Fukuda he founded the Inter Action Councils in 1983. He retired from the Bundestag in 1986. In December 1986, he was one of the founders of the committee supporting the EMU and the creation of the European Central Bank.

Contrary to the line of his party, Schmidt was a determined opponent of Turkey&#x27;s bid to join the EU. He also opposed phasing out nuclear energy, something that the Red-Green coalition of Gerhard Schröder supported. In 2007, Schmidt described the climate debate as &quot;hysterically overheated&quot;. When asked about social media, Schmidt said he perceived the internet as &quot;threatening&quot;. He was particularly concerned about the superficiality of communication on the web.

Schmidt was highly critical of allowing immigration from outside of Europe, believing that people from these cultures would not integrate well. He said in a 2004 interview with Hamburger Abendblatt that &quot;a multicultural society can function peacefully only under a strong authoritarian state like Singapore, the cultures there all speak English and the political system is based on authority.&quot; In 2005, he spoke out against attempts to remedy Germany&#x27;s aging population with more immigration: &quot;Immigration of people from East of Anatolia or from Subsaharan Africa does not solve the problem, it only creates a much bigger problem.&quot; In a 2010 interview with Sandra Maischberger, he said that &quot;Immigration from foreign civilizations creates more problems than it can bring us in terms of benefits on the labor market. Immigration from Europe is no problem, the problem starts from somewhat more eastern regions. These are different cultures, not because of their different genes or ancestry, but because of they way they were raised.&quot;

On 16 May 2014, Schmidt said the Russo-Ukrainian War was dangerous, because, &quot;Europe, the Americans and also Russia are behaving in a way that Christopher Clark described in his book &quot;The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914&quot; that&#x27;s very much worth reading, as the beginning of World War I: like sleepwalkers.&quot; Clark later disputed comparisons between the Russo-Ukrainian War and World War I, saying in 2022, &quot;The first world war began in an incredibly complex, around-the-houses way. Whereas in the case of the invasion of Ukraine, in 2014 and this year, it&#x27;s quite clearly a case of the breach of the peace by just one power.&quot;

Schmidt was the author of numerous books on his political life, on foreign policy, and political ethics. He made appearances in numerous television talk shows, and remained one of the most renowned political publicists in Germany until his death.

In his later years, Schmidt gained a positive reputation as an across party lines in Germany.

== Friendships ==
Schmidt described the assassinated Egyptian president Anwar Sadat as one of his friends from the world of politics, and maintained a friendship with ex-president Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing of France. His circle also included former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and former U.S. Secretaries of State George Shultz and Henry Kissinger. Kissinger went on record as stating that he wished to predecease Helmut Schmidt, because he would not wish to live in a world without him.

He was also good friends with former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. At the 4th G7 summit in 1978, the two discussed strategies for the upcoming Canadian federal election, and Schmidt gave him advice on economic policy. In 2011, Schmidt made a pilgrimage to the Trudeau family vault in St-Rémi-de-Napierville Cemetery, accompanied by Jean Chrétien and Tom Axworthy.

== Personal life ==
Schmidt admired the philosopher Karl Popper, and contributed a foreword to the 1982 &quot;Festschrift&quot; in Popper&#x27;s honour.

Schmidt was a talented pianist, and recorded piano concertos of both Mozart and Bach with German pianist and conductor Christoph Eschenbach. Schmidt recorded Mozart&#x27;s piano concerto for three pianos, K. 242, with the London Philharmonic Orchestra directed by Eschenbach in 1982 with pianists Eschenbach and Justus Frantz for EMI Records (CDC 7 47473 2). In that recording, according to the CDs liner notes, Schmidt played the part written for Countess Antonia Lodron&#x27;s youngest daughter Giuseppina, &quot;almost a beginner&quot; who commissioned the work. The part brilliantly &quot;enables any reasonably practiced amateur to participate in a performance&quot;. The same musical notes also indicate that Schmidt and Frantz had played duets during Frantz&#x27;s student days. In 1990 Schmidt joined Eschenbach, Frantz, Gerhard Oppitz and the Hamburg Philharmonic Orchestra in Deutsche Grammophon&#x27;s recording of Bach&#x27;s Concerto in A minor for four harpsichords, BWV 1065.
All his adult life, Schmidt was a heavy smoker. He was well known for lighting up during TV interviews and talk shows. On 13 October 1981, Schmidt was fitted with a cardiac pacemaker. On 24 August 2002, he suffered a heart attack and subsequently underwent bypass surgery.

On 25 January 2008, German police launched an inquiry after an anti-smoking initiative charged that Schmidt was defying the recently introduced smoking ban. The initiative claimed that Schmidt had been flagrantly ignoring anti-smoking laws. Despite pictures in the press, the case was subsequently dropped after the public prosecutor&#x27;s office ruled that Schmidt&#x27;s actions had not been a threat to public health.

On 6 April 2010, with a lifespan of 33,342 days, he surpassed Konrad Adenauer in terms of longevity, and at the time of his death was the oldest former chancellor in German history.

His wife of 68 years, Loki Schmidt, died on 21 October 2010, aged 91.

At the beginning of August 2012, Schmidt gave an interview on German television and revealed that at 93 years of age, he had fallen in love again. His new life-partner was his associate of over 57 years, Ruth Loah (27 September 1933 – 23 February 2017).

== Illness, death and state funeral ==

On 2 September 2015, Schmidt underwent surgery for a vascular occlusion in his right leg. On 17 September, he was discharged from hospital. After initial improvement, his condition worsened again on 9 November, with his doctor saying he &quot;feared for the worst&quot;. Schmidt died in his Hamburg home on the afternoon of 10 November 2015, aged 96. At the time of his death, he was the longest-lived German Chancellor.
A state funeral for Schmidt was held on 23 November at the Protestant (Lutheran) St. Michael&#x27;s Church, Hamburg, where Loki Schmidt&#x27;s funeral had been held. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in remarks to mourners, said, &quot;He will be missed. He was an astute observer and commentator, and it was with good reason that he had a reputation for dependability.&quot; Others who spoke included former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Speaking in German, he lauded Schmidt for &quot;vision and courage&quot;, based on the principles of &quot;reason, law, peace and faith&quot;, and said Schmidt had been &quot;a kind of world conscience&quot;.

Among the 1,800 who attended were German President Joachim Gauck, former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former French President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, whose tenure in office paralleled Schmidt&#x27;s as German chancellor. Other guests included former chancellor Gerhard Schröder, former presidents Christian Wulff, Horst Köhler, Roman Herzog and Hamburg&#x27;s mayor Olaf Scholz. A flag-draped coffin containing the remains of the former chancellor, also a former German defense minister, was escorted by the German Army&#x27;s Wachbataillon from St. Michael&#x27;s to Ohlsdorf Cemetery for a private interment ceremony. Helmut Schmidt&#x27;s remains were buried there one day later, in the family grave alongside the remains of his parents and his wife, Loki.

== Honours and awards ==
Helmut Schmidt received a number of accolades. Among those offered was the Grand Cross Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, which he chose not to accept in Hanseatic tradition in line with the history of independence of Hamburg.

In 2003, the university of Germany&#x27;s federal armed forces in Hamburg was renamed Helmut Schmidt University – University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg in 2003, in honour of the politician whoas minister of defensehad introduced mandatory academic education for German career officers.

In November 2016, Hamburg Airport was renamed &quot;Hamburg Airport Helmut Schmidt&quot; in his honour.

== Controversies over service in World War II ==
In 2017, after Minister of Defense Ursula von der Leyen issued an order to remove &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; memorabilia from barracks and other institutions of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;, a photo of the young Lieutenant Helmut Schmidt in &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; uniform was removed from the military&#x27;s Helmut Schmidt University in Hamburg. Although the photo is now displayed again, the initial decision has caused a debate over Schmidt&#x27;s service in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. According to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, von der Leyen initially distanced herself from this decision, yet after a few days, she explained that Schmidt, as Minister of Defense and later Chancellor, was important in the formation of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; as a democratic army, but his time in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; had nothing to do with this. Historian Michael Wolffsohn argues that Schmidt avoided explaining about &quot;what he had done between 1940 and 1945.&quot; He further comments that the whole Schmidt affair reveals that while the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; is not &quot;a state within state&quot;, there is an uncritical milieu in the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; that does not correspond to the spirit of the majority in the German society and might get larger if unchecked. He recommends that the photo be displayed again, but with explanations. Theo Sommer, a prominent journalist and former Chief of Planning Staff for the Ministry of Defence, while agreeing that the military leadership should pay attention to extremism within the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;, criticizes von der Leyen for her overreaction and Wolffsohn for false representation of Schmidt&#x27;s attitude. According to Sommer, Schmidt had always been frank about his service on the Eastern Front: while he denied that he had ever seen or known about mass extermination of Jews in Russia, Schmidt admitted he often had to shoot at villages and then recognized the smell of burnt flesh. Schmidt said the troops were never taught about the Geneva Conventions, and by standards of today, he would have to go to court &quot;a dozen times&quot;. According to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, Schmidt dated his departure from &quot;idea and practice of National Socialism&quot; to 1942 and his recognition of the criminal character of the regime to 1944.

<text>Ludwig Wilhelm Erhard (; 4 February 1897 – 5 May 1977) was a German politician and economist affiliated with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and chancellor of West Germany from 1963 until 1966. He is known for leading the West German postwar economic reforms and economic recovery (&quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot;, German for &quot;economic miracle&quot;) in his role as Minister of Economic Affairs under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer from 1949 to 1963. During that period he promoted the concept of the social market economy (&quot;soziale Marktwirtschaft&quot;), on which Germany&#x27;s economic policy in the 21st century continues to be based.

In his tenure as Chancellor, however, Erhard lacked support from Adenauer, who remained chairman of the CDU party until 1966. Erhard failed to win the German public&#x27;s confidence in his handling of a budget deficit and lacked public support for his direction of foreign policy. His popularity waned, and he resigned his chancellorship on 30 November 1966.

== Early life ==
Ludwig Erhard was born in Fürth, then in the Kingdom of Bavaria, on 4 February 1897. His father Wilhelm Erhard (born 1859) was a Catholic Church clothing store proprietor, while his mother Augusta adhered to Protestantism. Ludwig had two brothers and a sister, all of whom were raised as Protestants. Ludwig suffered from infantile paralysis in his third year, resulting in a deformed right foot and forcing him to wear orthopedic shoes for the remainder of his life.

Erhard entered primary school in Fürth at the age of six in 1903 and performed poorly. In 1907, he entered Fürth&#x27;s Royal Bavarian Vocational High School, where his grades were average. He received his secondary school certificate in 1913. In the following years, he was a commercial apprentice at the Georg Eisenbach textile company in Nuremberg until 1916 and worked thereafter as a retail salesman in his father&#x27;s draper&#x27;s shop.

== Military service and university ==
In 1916, Erhard volunteered for the German military. During World War I he was transferred to the 22nd Royal Bavarian Artillery Regiment and trained as a gunner. He first served in the quiet Vosges sector on the Western Front. The regiment was then deployed in the Romanian Campaign on the Eastern Front. He personally saw little combat, but contracted typhus and was sent back to Germany. After he managed a recovery Erhard returned to his unit. He was badly wounded on his left shoulder, side and leg by an Allied artillery shell on 28 September 1918 during the Fifth Battle of Ypres. Erhard was committed to a military hospital in Recklinghausen, where he underwent seven operations until June 1919. His left arm ended up permanently shorter than his right one.

Due to his injury he could no longer work as a draper so Erhard started learning economics in late 1919 at a business college in Nuremberg. He passed the school&#x27;s exit examination on 22 March 1922 and received a degree in business administration. During his time at school, he developed a friendship with the economist and professor Wilhelm Rieger, to whom Erhard owed much of his convictions of economic liberalism. Thanks to Rieger&#x27;s intervention, Erhard was able to enroll at the Goethe University Frankfurt in the autumn of 1922. He received his PhD from the university on 12 December 1925 for a dissertation finished in the summer of 1924 under Franz Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer&#x27;s liberal socialist ideology had a heavy influence on Erhard, especially Oppenheimer&#x27;s opposition to monopolies. In Frankfurt he married Luise Schuster, a fellow economist, on 11 December 1923. They had known each other since childhood.

== Early career ==
After his graduation they moved to Fürth and he became an executive in his father&#x27;s company in 1925. Erhard spent the next three years as a mostly unemployed academic. His father retired in 1928. The same year, thanks to the help of Rieger and Oppenheimer, Erhard became a part-time research assistant at the &quot;Institut für Wirtschaftsbeobachtung der deutschen Fertigware&quot; (Economic Observation of the German Finished Goods Industry), a marketing research institute founded by Wilhelm Rudolf Mann and :de:Wilhelm Vershofen. Later, he became deputy director of the institute.

During World War II he worked on concepts for a postwar peace; however, officially such studies were forbidden by the Nazis, who had declared &#x27;total war&#x27;. As a result, Erhard lost his job in 1942, but continued to work on the subject by order of the Reichsgruppe Industrie. He wrote &quot;War Finances and Debt Consolidation&quot; (orig: &quot;Kriegsfinanzierung und Schuldenkonsolidierung&quot;) in 1944; in this study he assumed that Germany had already lost the war. He sent his thoughts to Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, a central figure in the German resistance to Nazism, who recommended Erhard to his comrades. Erhard also discussed his concept with Otto Ohlendorf, deputy secretary of state in the Reichsministerium für Wirtschaft. Ohlendorf himself spoke out for &quot;active and courageous entrepreneurship (&quot;aktives und wagemutiges Unternehmertum&quot;)&quot;, which was intended to replace bureaucratic state planning of the economy after the war.

== Post-war career ==
When the war had finished, Erhard became an economic consultant. Under the Bizone established by the American and British administration in 1947, he led the &quot;Sonderstelle Geld und Kredit&quot; (&quot;Special Office for Money and Credit&quot;), an expert commission preparing the currency reform in Germany&#x27;s western zones of occupation. The commission began its deliberations in October 1947, and the following April produced the so-called Homburg plan, elements of which were adopted by the Allies in the currency reform that set the stage for the recovery of the economy.

In April 1948, Erhard was elected director of economics by the Bizonal Economic Council. On 20 June 1948, the Deutsche Mark was introduced. Erhard abolished the price-fixing and production controls that had been enacted by the military administration. This exceeded his authority, but he succeeded with this step. In July 1948, a group of southwest German businessmen attacked the restrictive credit policy of Erhard as Economic Director. While Erhard had designed this policy to assure currency stability and stimulate the economy via consumption, business feared the scarcity of investment capital would retard economic recovery.

== Minister of Economic Affairs ==

In the first free elections of the federal parliament in September 1949, Erhard was elected in a Baden-Württemberg district as candidate of the Christian Democratic Union. He was appointed Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, a position he would hold for the next 14 years; from 1957 to 1963 he was also the vice-chancellor of Germany. Erhard&#x27;s financial and economic policies soon proved widely popular as the German economy made a miracle recovery to rapid growth and widespread prosperity in the 1950s, overcoming wartime destruction and successfully integrating millions of refugees from the east.

A staunch believer in economic liberalism, Erhard joined the Mont Pelerin Society in 1950, and used this influential body of liberal economic and political thinkers to test his ideas for the reorganization of the West German economy. Some of the society&#x27;s members were members of the Allied High Commission and Erhard was able to make his case directly to them. The Mont Pélerin Society welcomed Erhard because this gave its members a welcome opportunity to have their ideas tested in real life. Alfred Müller-Armack, the secretary of state of Erhard&#x27;s ministry, helped him guide German economy with theories until the beginning of 1960s.

Late in the 1950s, Erhard&#x27;s ministry became involved in the struggle within the society between the European and the Anglo-American factions, and sided with the former. Erhard viewed the market itself as social and supported only a minimum of welfare legislation. However, Erhard suffered a series of decisive defeats in his effort to create a free, competitive economy in 1957; he had to compromise on such key issues as the anti-cartel legislation. Thereafter, the West German economy evolved into a conventional welfare state from the basis that had been already laid in the 1880s by Bismarck. According to Alfred Mierzejewski the generally accepted view is that Germany has a social market economy, that the post-war German economy has evolved since 1948, but the fundamental characteristics of that economic system have not changed, while in his opinion the social market economy had begun to fade in 1957, disappearing entirely by the late 1960s.

Erhard was also deeply critical of a bureaucratic-institutional integration of Europe on the model of the European Coal and Steel Community.

== Chancellor ==


After the resignation of Adenauer in 1963, Erhard was elected chancellor with 279 against 180 votes in the Bundestag on 16 October. In 1965, he was re-elected. From 1966 to 1967, he also headed the Christian Democratic Union as &quot;de facto&quot; chairman, despite the fact that he was never a member of that party (which made his election to the chairmanship irregular and void &quot;de jure&quot;), as he never formally filed a membership application despite pressure from Chancellor Adenauer. The reasons for Erhard&#x27;s reluctance are unknown, but it is probable that they stemmed from Erhard&#x27;s general scepticism about party politics. However, Erhard was regarded and treated as a long-time CDU member and as the party chairman by almost everyone in Germany at the time, including the vast majority of the CDU itself. The fact that he was not a member was known only to a very small circle of party leaders, and it did not become known to the public until 2007, when the silence was finally broken by Erhard&#x27;s close advisor Horst Wünsche.

Domestically, a number of progressive reforms were carried out during Erhard&#x27;s time as chancellor. In the field of social security, Housing Benefit was introduced in 1965.

=== Foreign policy and international trips ===

Erhard considered using money to bring about the reunification of Germany, which would have broken a diplomatic stalemate that had existed since the end of the Second World War regarding the status of West and East Germany. Despite Washington&#x27;s reluctance, Erhard envisaged offering Nikita Khrushchev, the leader in Moscow, massive economic aid in exchange for more political liberty in East Germany and eventually for reunification. Erhard believed that if West Germany were to offer a &quot;loan&quot; worth $25 billion US to the Soviet Union (which Erhard did not expect to be repaid), then the Soviet Union would permit German reunification. Erhard did not have a specific, concrete plan in mind, however, believing that reality, and especially negotiations over such a major proposition, were too complex to be forecasted in advance with any accuracy, and as a result, he prepared to negotiate without any predetermined agenda. The acting American Secretary of State George Wildman Ball described Erhard&#x27;s plan to essentially buy East Germany from the Soviet Union as &quot;half-baked and unrealistic.&quot; Erhard&#x27;s objective coincided with Khrushchev rethinking his relations with West Germany. The Soviet leader secretly encouraged Erhard to present a realistic proposal for a &quot;modus vivendi&quot; and officially accepted the Chancellor&#x27;s invitation to visit Bonn. However, Khrushchev fell from power in October 1964, and nothing developed out of Erhard&#x27;s envisioned idea for the reunification of Germany. Perhaps more importantly, the Soviet Union had received a vast series of loans from the international money markets by late 1964, and no longer felt the need for Erhard&#x27;s money.

Support for the American role in the Vietnam War proved fatal for Erhard&#x27;s coalition. Through his endorsement of the American goal of military victory in Vietnam, Erhard sought closer collaboration with Washington and less with Paris. Erhard&#x27;s policy complicated Allied initiatives toward German unification, a dilemma that the United States placed on the back burner as it focused on Southeast Asia. Erhard failed to understand that American global interests—not Europe&#x27;s needs—dictated policy in Washington, D.C., and he rejected Adenauer&#x27;s policy of fostering good relations with both the United States and France in the pursuit of West German national interest. Faced with a dangerous budget deficit in the 1966–1967 recession, Erhard fell from office in part because of concessions that he made during a visit to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson.

Erhard&#x27;s fall suggested that progress on German unification required a broader approach and a more active foreign policy. Chancellor Willy Brandt in the late 1960s abandoned the Hallstein Doctrine of previous chancellors and employed a new &quot;Ostpolitik&quot;, seeking improved relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and thereby laying the groundwork for détente and coexistence between East and West. In the 1980s Chancellor Helmut Kohl, however, reverted to Erhard&#x27;s approach in collaborating with the Reagan administration in its hard-line anti-Soviet policy.

Under Erhard&#x27;s government the Federal Republic entered into diplomatic relations with Israel in 1965.

== Resignation and retirement ==

On 26 October 1966, Minister Walter Scheel (FDP) resigned, protesting against the budget released the day before. The other ministers who were members of the FDP followed his example — the coalition was broken. On 30 November 1966, Erhard resigned. His successor was Kurt Georg Kiesinger (CDU), who formed a grand coalition with the SPD.

Erhard continued his political work by remaining a member of the West German parliament until his death in Bonn from heart failure on 5 May 1977. He was buried in his living place Gmund at the Tegernsee in Upper Bavaria. The Ludwig Erhard-Berufsschule (professional college) in Paderborn, Fürth and Münster are named in his honour.

<text>Alfredo James Pacino ( ; ; born April 25, 1940) is an American actor. He has received many accolades including an Academy Award, two Tony Awards, and two Primetime Emmy Awards, achieving the Triple Crown of Acting. He has also received four Golden Globe Awards, a BAFTA, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2001, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2007, the National Medal of Arts in 2011, and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2016.

A method actor, Pacino studied at HB Studio and the Actors Studio, where he was taught by Charlie Laughton and Lee Strasberg. Pacino went on to receive the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; (1992). His other Oscar-nominated roles were in &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972), &quot;Serpico&quot; (1973), &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974), &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; (1975), &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; (1979), &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (1990), &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Irishman&quot; (2019). His other notable roles include &quot;The Panic in Needle Park&quot; (1971), &quot;Scarecrow&quot; (1973), &quot;Cruising&quot; (1980), &quot;Scarface&quot; (1983), &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; (1990), &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; (1993), &quot;Heat&quot; (1995), &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot;, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; (both 1997), &quot;The Insider&quot;, &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; (both 1999), &quot;Insomnia&quot; (2002), &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot; (2007), &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; (2019), and &quot;House of Gucci&quot; (2021).

On television, Pacino has acted in multiple productions for HBO, including &quot;Angels in America&quot; (2003) and the Jack Kevorkian biopic &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; (2010), winning a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for each. Pacino starred in the Amazon Prime Video series &quot;Hunters&quot; (2020–23). He has also had an extensive career on stage. He is a two-time Tony Award winner, winning Best Featured Actor in a Play in &quot;Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?&quot; (1969) and Best Actor in a Play for &quot;The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel&quot; (1977).

Pacino made his directorial debut with the documentary &quot;Looking for Richard&quot; (1996). He has played the lead role on stage in 1977. He has also acted as Shylock in a 2004 feature film adaptation and 2010 stage production of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. Pacino directed and starred in &quot;Chinese Coffee&quot; (2000), &quot;Wilde Salomé&quot; (2011), and &quot;Salomé&quot; (2013). Since 1994, he has been the joint president of the Actors Studio.

== Early life and education ==
Alfredo James Pacino was born in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, on April 25, 1940, the only child of Sicilian Italian-American parents Rose () and Salvatore Pacino. His father had immigrated from San Fratello. His parents divorced when he was two years old. His mother took him to the South Bronx and they lived with her parents, Kate and James Gerardi. They had immigrated from Corleone when young. Pacino&#x27;s father moved to California to work as an insurance salesman and restaurateur in Covina, California.

In his teenage years, Pacino was known as &quot;Sonny&quot; to his friends. He had ambitions to become a baseball player and was also nicknamed &quot;The Actor&quot;. He attended Herman Ridder Junior High School, but soon dropped out of most of his classes except for English. He subsequently attended the High School of Performing Arts, after gaining admission by audition. His mother disagreed with his decision and, after an argument, he left home. To finance his acting studies, Pacino took low-paying jobs as a messenger, busboy, janitor, and postal clerk, as well as once working in the mailroom for &quot;Commentary&quot;.

Pacino began smoking and drinking at age nine, and used marijuana casually at age 13, but he abstained from hard drugs. His two closest friends died from drug abuse at the ages of 19 and 30. Growing up in the South Bronx, Pacino got into occasional fights and was considered something of a troublemaker at school. He acted in basement plays in New York&#x27;s theatrical underground, but was rejected as a teenager by the Actors Studio. Instead, Pacino joined the HB Studio, where he met acting teacher Charlie Laughton, who became his mentor and best friend. In this period, he was often unemployed or homeless, and sometimes slept on the street, in theaters, or at a friend&#x27;s home.

In 1962, Pacino&#x27;s mother died at the age of 43. The following year, his maternal grandfather also died. Pacino recalled it as the lowest point of his life and said, &quot;I was 22 and the two most influential people in my life had gone, so that sent me into a tailspin.&quot;

After four years at HB Studio, Pacino successfully auditioned for the Actors Studio. The Actors Studio is a membership organization of professional actors, theater directors, and playwrights in the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan. Pacino studied &quot;method acting&quot; under acting coach Lee Strasberg, who appeared with Pacino in the films &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; and in &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;.

During later interviews, he spoke about Strasberg and the Studio&#x27;s effect on his career. &quot;The Actors Studio meant so much to me in my life. Lee Strasberg hasn&#x27;t been given the credit he deserves ... Next to Charlie, it sort of launched me. It really did. That was a remarkable turning point in my life. It was directly responsible for getting me to quit all those jobs and just stay acting.&quot; In another interview he added, &quot;It was exciting to work for him [Lee Strasberg] because he was so interesting when he talked about a scene or talked about people. One would just want to hear him talk, because things he would say, you&#x27;d never heard before ... He had such a great understanding ... he loved actors so much.&quot;

In 2000, Pacino was selected as co-president of the Actors Studio, along with Ellen Burstyn and Harvey Keitel.

== Career ==
=== 1967–1971: Theater roles and film debut === 

In 1967, Pacino spent a season at the Charles Playhouse in Boston, performing in Clifford Odets&#x27; &quot;Awake and Sing!&quot; (his first major paycheck: US$125 a week); and in Jean-Claude Van Itallie&#x27;s &quot;America Hurrah&quot;. He met actress Jill Clayburgh on this play. They had a five-year romance and moved back to New York City. In 1968, Pacino starred in Israel Horovitz&#x27;s &quot;The Indian Wants the Bronx&quot; at the Astor Place Theatre, playing Murph, a street punk. The play opened January 17, 1968, and ran for 177 performances; it was staged in a double bill with Horovitz&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Called the Sugar Plum&quot;, starring Clayburgh. Pacino won an Obie Award for Best Actor for his role, with John Cazale winning for Best Supporting Actor and Horowitz for Best New Play. Martin Bregman saw the play and became Pacino&#x27;s manager, a partnership that became fruitful in the years to come, as Bregman encouraged Pacino to do &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;Serpico&quot;, and &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;. About his stage career, Pacino said, &quot;Martin Bregman discovered me ... I was 26, 25 ... he discovered me and became my manager. And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here. I owe it to Marty, I really do&quot;.

Pacino took the production of &quot;The Indian Wants the Bronx&quot; to Italy for a performance at the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto. It was Pacino&#x27;s first journey to Italy; he later recalled that &quot;performing for an Italian audience was a marvelous experience&quot;. Pacino and Clayburgh were cast in &quot;Deadly Circle of Violence&quot;, an episode of the ABC television series &quot;NYPD&quot;, premiering November 12, 1968. Clayburgh at the time was also appearing on the soap opera &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, playing the role of Grace Bolton. Her father would send the couple money each month to help with finances.

On February 25, 1969, Pacino made his Broadway debut in Don Petersen&#x27;s &quot;Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?&quot; at the Belasco Theater, produced by A&amp;P Heir Huntington Hartford. It closed after 39 performances on March 29, 1969, but Pacino received rave reviews and won the Tony Award on April 20, 1969. Pacino continued performing onstage in the 1970s, winning a second Tony Award for &quot;The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel&quot; and performing the title role in &quot;Richard III&quot;. In the 1980s, Pacino again achieved critical success on stage while appearing in David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;American Buffalo,&quot; for which Pacino was nominated for a Drama Desk Award. Since 1990, Pacino&#x27;s stage work has included revivals of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Hughie&quot;, Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot; and in 2005 Lyle Kessler&#x27;s &quot;Orphans&quot;. Pacino found acting enjoyable and realized he had a gift for it while studying at The Actors Studio. However, his early work was not financially rewarding. After his success on stage, Pacino made his film debut in 1969 with a brief appearance in &quot;Me, Natalie&quot;, an independent film starring Patty Duke. In 1970, Pacino signed with the talent agency Creative Management Associates (CMA). Pacino made his feature film debut portraying a heroin addict in &quot;The Panic in Needle Park&quot; (1971).

=== 1972–1983: Stardom and acclaim === 

Francis Ford Coppola cast him as Michael Corleone in what became a blockbuster Mafia film, &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972). Although Jack Nicholson, Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, and the little-known Robert De Niro tried out for the part, Coppola selected Pacino, to the dismay of studio executives who wanted someone better known. Pacino&#x27;s performance earned him an Academy Award nomination, and offered a prime example of his early acting style, described by &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot; as &quot;intense&quot; and &quot;tightly clenched&quot;. Pacino boycotted the Academy Award ceremony, insulted at being nominated for the Supporting Acting award, as he noted that he had more screen time than co-star and Best Actor winner Marlon Brandowho also boycotted the awards, but for unrelated reasons. In 1973, Pacino co-starred in &quot;Scarecrow&quot; with Gene Hackman, which won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival. That same year, Pacino was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor after starring in &quot;Serpico&quot;, based on the true story of New York City policeman Frank Serpico, who went undercover to expose the corruption of fellow officers. In 1974, Pacino reprised his role as Michael Corleone in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;, which was the first sequel to win the Best Picture Oscar; Pacino was nominated a third time for an Oscar, this second nomination for the Corleone role being in the lead category. &quot;Newsweek&quot; has described his performance in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; as &quot;arguably cinema&#x27;s greatest portrayal of the hardening of a heart&quot;.

In 1975, he enjoyed further success with the release of &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;, based on the true story of bank robber John Wojtowicz. It was directed by Sidney Lumet, who had directed him in &quot;Serpico&quot; a few years earlier, and Pacino was again nominated for Best Actor. In 1977, Pacino starred as a race-car driver in &quot;Bobby Deerfield&quot;, directed by Sydney Pollack, and received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama for his portrayal of the title role. His next film was the courtroom drama &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;. Pacino was lauded by critics for his wide range of acting abilities, and nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for a fourth time. He lost out that year to Dustin Hoffman in &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot;—a role that Pacino had declined. During the 1970s, Pacino had five Oscar nominations, including four for Best Actor for his performances in &quot;Serpico&quot;, &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;, &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;, and &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;.

Pacino&#x27;s career slumped in the early 1980s; his appearances in the controversial &quot;Cruising&quot;, a film that provoked protests from New York&#x27;s gay community, and the comedy-drama &quot;Author! Author!&quot;, were critically panned.
However, his performance in &quot;Scarface&quot; (1983), directed by Brian De Palma, proved to be a career highlight and a defining role. Upon its initial release, the film was critically panned due to violent content, but later received critical acclaim. The film did well at the box office, grossing over US$45 million domestically. Pacino earned a Golden Globe nomination for his role as Cuban drug lord Tony Montana.

In 1983, Pacino became a major donor for The Mirror Theater Ltd, alongside Dustin Hoffman and Paul Newman, matching a grant from Laurance Rockefeller. The men were inspired to invest by their connection with Lee Strasberg, as Strasberg&#x27;s daughter-in-law Sabra Jones was the founder and Producing Artistic Director of The Mirror. In 1985, Pacino offered the company his production of &quot;Hughie&quot; by Eugene O&#x27;Neill, but the company was unable to do it at the time due to the small cast. In 1985, Pacino worked on his personal project, &quot;The Local Stigmatic&quot;, a 1969 off-Broadway play by the English writer Heathcote Williams. He starred in the play, remounting it with director David Wheeler and the Theater Company of Boston in a 50-minute film version. The film was not released theatrically, but was later released as part of the &quot;Pacino: An Actor&#x27;s Vision&quot; box set in 2007.

=== 1984–1999: Career fluctuations === 

His 1985 film &quot;Revolution&quot; about a fur trapper during the American Revolutionary War, was a commercial and critical failure, which Pacino blamed on a rushed production, resulting in a four-year hiatus from films. At this time Pacino returned to the stage. He mounted workshop productions of &quot;Crystal Clear&quot;, &quot;National Anthems&quot; and other plays; he appeared in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; in 1988 in producer Joseph Papp&#x27;s New York Shakespeare Festival. Pacino remarked on his hiatus from film: &quot;I remember back when everything was happening, &#x27;74, &#x27;75, doing &quot;The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui&quot; on stage and reading that the reason I&#x27;d gone back to the stage was that my movie career was waning! That&#x27;s been the kind of ethos, the way in which theater&#x27;s perceived, unfortunately.&quot; Pacino returned to film in 1989&#x27;s &quot;Sea of Love&quot;, when he portrayed a detective hunting a serial killer who finds victims through the singles column in a newspaper. The film earned solid reviews. Pacino received an Academy Award nomination for playing Big Boy Caprice in the box office hit &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; in 1990, of which critic Roger Ebert described Pacino as &quot;the scene-stealer&quot;. Later in the year he followed this up in a return to one of his most famous characters, Michael Corleone, in &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; (1990).

In 1991, Pacino starred in &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot; with Michelle Pfeiffer, who co-starred with Pacino in &quot;Scarface&quot;. Pacino played a recently paroled cook who begins a relationship with a waitress (Pfeiffer) in the diner where they work. It was adapted by Terrence McNally from his own off-Broadway play &quot;Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune&quot; (1987), that featured Kenneth Welsh and Kathy Bates. The film received mixed reviews, although Pacino later said he enjoyed playing the part. Janet Maslin in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Mr. Pacino has not been this uncomplicatedly appealing since his &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; days, and he makes Johnny&#x27;s endless enterprise in wooing Frankie a delight. His scenes alone with Ms. Pfeiffer have a precision and honesty that keep the film&#x27;s maudlin aspects at bay.&quot; For his portrayal of the irascible, blind U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade in Martin Brest&#x27;s &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; (1992) Pacino won the Academy Award for Best Actor next year. He was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot;, making Pacino the first male actor ever to receive two acting nominations for two movies in the same year, and to win for the lead role.
Pacino starred alongside Sean Penn in the crime drama &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; in 1993, in which he played Carlito Brigante, a gangster released from prison with the help of his corrupt lawyer (Penn) and vows to go straight. Pacino starred in Michael Mann&#x27;s &quot;Heat&quot; (1995), in which he and Robert De Niro appeared on-screen together for the first time (though both Pacino and De Niro starred in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;, they did not share any scenes). In 1996, Pacino starred in his theatrical docudrama &quot;Looking for Richard&quot;, a performance of selected scenes of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot; and a broader examination of Shakespeare&#x27;s continuing role and relevance in popular culture. The cast brought together for the performance included Alec Baldwin, Kevin Spacey, and Winona Ryder. 

Pacino played Satan in the supernatural thriller &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; (1997) which co-starred Keanu Reeves. The film was a success at the box office, taking US$150 million worldwide. Roger Ebert wrote in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, &quot;The satanic character is played by Pacino with relish bordering on glee.&quot; In 1997&#x27;s &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot;, Pacino played gangster &quot;Lefty&quot; in the true story of undercover FBI agent Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp) and his work in bringing down the Mafia from the inside. In 1999, Pacino starred as &quot;60 Minutes&quot; producer Lowell Bergman in the multi-Oscar nominated &quot;The Insider&quot; opposite Russell Crowe, and in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;.

=== 2000–2018: Television roles and return to Broadway ===
Pacino won three Golden Globes since 2000; the first being the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2001 for lifetime achievement in motion pictures. In 2000, Pacino starred alongside Jerry Orbach in a low-budget film adaptation of Ira Lewis&#x27; play &quot;Chinese Coffee&quot;, which was released to film festivals. Shot almost exclusively as a one-on-one conversation between two main characters, the project took nearly three years to complete and was funded entirely by Pacino. &quot;Chinese Coffee&quot; was included with Pacino&#x27;s two other rare films he was involved in producing, &quot;The Local Stigmatic&quot; and &quot;Looking for Richard&quot;, on a special DVD box set titled &quot;Pacino: An Actor&#x27;s Vision&quot;, which was released in 2007. Pacino produced prologues and epilogues for the discs containing the films. Pacino turned down an offer to reprise his role as Michael Corleone in the computer game version of &quot;The Godfather&quot;. As a result, Electronic Arts was not permitted to use Pacino&#x27;s likeness or voice in the game, although his character does appear in it. He did allow his likeness to appear in the video game adaptation of 1983&#x27;s &quot;Scarface&quot;, the quasi-sequel &quot;&quot;.
In October 2002, Pacino starred in Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui&quot; for the National Actor&#x27;s Theater and Complicite. Directed by Simon McBurney, the production starred a host of Hollywood names, including John Goodman, Charles Durning, Tony Randall, Steve Buscemi, Chazz Palminteri, Paul Giamatti, Jacqueline McKenzie, Billy Crudup, Lothaire Bluteau, Dominic Chianese and Sterling K. Brown. The production was a critical success in which &quot;Pacino grabs and holds the attention like a coiled spring about to snap. He is all brooding menace and crocodile grimace, butchering his way to the top with unnervingly sinister glee.&quot; Director Christopher Nolan worked with Pacino on &quot;Insomnia&quot;, a remake of the Norwegian film of the same name, co-starring Robin Williams. &quot;Newsweek&quot; stated that &quot;he [Pacino] can play small as rivetingly as he can play big, that he can implode as well as explode&quot;. The film and Pacino&#x27;s performance were well received, gaining a favorable rating of 93 percent on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes. The film did moderately well at the box office, taking in $113 million worldwide. His next film, &quot;S1m0ne&quot;, however, did not receive much critical praise or box office success.

He played a publicist in &quot;People I Know&quot;, a small film that received little attention despite Pacino&#x27;s well-received performance. Rarely taking a supporting role since his commercial breakthrough, he accepted a small part in the critical and box office flop &quot;Gigli&quot;, in 2003, as a favor to director Martin Brest. &quot;The Recruit&quot;, released in 2003, featured Pacino as a CIA recruiter and co-stars Colin Farrell. The film received mixed reviews, and has been described by Pacino as something he &quot;personally couldn&#x27;t follow&quot;. Pacino next starred as lawyer Roy Cohn in the 2003 HBO miniseries &quot;Angels in America&quot;, an adaptation of Tony Kushner&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize winning play of the same name. For this performance, Pacino won his third Golden Globe, for Best Performance by an Actor, in 2004.

Pacino starred as Shylock in Michael Radford&#x27;s 2004 film adaptation of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. Critics praised him for bringing compassion and depth to a character traditionally played as a villainous caricature. In &quot;Two for the Money&quot;, Pacino portrays a sports gambling agent and mentor for Matthew McConaughey, alongside Rene Russo. The film was released on October 8, 2005, to mixed reviews. Desson Thomson wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Al Pacino has played the mentor so many times, he ought to get a kingmaker&#x27;s award ... the fight between good and evil feels fixed in favor of Hollywood redemption.&quot; On October 20, 2006, the American Film Institute named Pacino the recipient of the 35th AFI Life Achievement Award. On November 22, 2006, the University Philosophical Society of Trinity College Dublin awarded Pacino the Honorary Patronage of the Society.

Pacino starred in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot;, alongside George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Elliott Gould and Andy García, as the villain Willy Bank, a casino tycoon targeted by Danny Ocean and his crew. The film received generally favorable reviews. &quot;88 Minutes&quot; was released on April 18, 2008, in the United States, after having been released in various other countries in 2007. The film co-starred Alicia Witt and was critically panned, although critics found fault with the plot, and not Pacino&#x27;s acting. In &quot;Righteous Kill&quot;, Pacino and Robert De Niro co-star as New York detectives searching for a serial killer. The film was released to theaters on September 12, 2008. While it was an anticipated return for the two stars, it was not well received by critics.
Pacino returned to the stage in the summer of 2010, playing Shylock in the Shakespeare in the Park production, &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. The acclaimed production moved to Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre in October, earning US$1 million at the box office in its first week. The performance also garnered him a Tony Award nomination for Best Leading Actor in a Play. Pacino played Jack Kevorkian in an HBO Films biopic titled &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot;, which premiered April 2010. The film is about the life and work of the physician-assisted suicide advocate. The performance earned Pacino his second Emmy Award for lead actor and his fourth Golden Globe award. He co-starred as himself in the 2011 comedy film &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;. The film was panned by critics, and Pacino &quot;won&quot; the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor at the 32nd ceremony. Elaborating on his decision to join the cast of the film, he stated: &quot;It came at a time in my life that I needed it, because it was after I found out I had no more money. My accountant [Kenneth I. Starr] was in prison, and I needed something quickly. So I took (&quot;Jack and Jill&quot;.)&quot;

He was presented with Jaeger-LeCoultre Glory to the Filmmaker Award on September 4, 2011, prior to the premiere of &quot;Wilde Salomé&quot;, a 2011 American documentary-drama film written, directed by and starring Pacino. Its US premiere on the evening of March 21, 2012, before a full house at the 1,400-seat Castro Theatre in San Francisco&#x27;s Castro District, marked the 130th anniversary of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s visit to San Francisco. The event was a benefit for the GLBT Historical Society. Pacino, who plays the role of Herod in the film, describes it as his &quot;most personal project ever&quot;. In February 2012, President Barack Obama awarded Pacino the National Medal of Arts. Pacino starred in the 30th-anniversary Broadway revival of David Mamet&#x27;s play, &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot;, which ran from October 2012 to January 20, 2013. He starred on Broadway in &quot;China Doll&quot;, a play written for him by Mamet, which opened on December 5, 2015, and closed on January 21, 2016, after 97 performances. The previews were done in October 2015.

Pacino starred in a 2013 HBO biographical picture about record producer Phil Spector&#x27;s murder trial, titled &quot;Phil Spector&quot;. He took the title role in the comedy-drama &quot;Danny Collins&quot; (2015). His performance as an aging rock star garnered him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy nomination. In 2016, Pacino received the Kennedy Center Honor. The tribute included remarks by his former costars Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Bobby Cannavale and Chris O&#x27;Donnell. In September 2012, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that Pacino would play the former Penn State University football coach Joe Paterno in the television film &quot;Paterno&quot; based on a 2012 biography by sportswriter Joe Posnanski. &quot;Paterno&quot; premiered on HBO on April 7, 2018.

=== 2019–present ===

Pacino starred alongside Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;, which was released on July 26, 2019. Later in 2019, Pacino played Teamsters chief Jimmy Hoffa, alongside Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s Netflix film &quot;The Irishman&quot;, based on the 2004 book &quot;I Heard You Paint Houses&quot; by Charles Brandt. This was the first time Pacino was directed by Scorsese, and he received a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the 92nd Academy Awards—his ninth to date. Pacino&#x27;s performance received positive reviews. Peter Bradshaw described it as &quot;glorious&quot; in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Justin Chang wrote, &quot;De Niro, Pesci and Pacino are at the top of their game, in part because they aren&#x27;t simply rehashing the iconic gangster types they&#x27;ve played before.&quot;

In February 2020, Pacino starred as Meyer Offerman, a fictional Nazi hunter, in the Amazon Prime Video series &quot;Hunters&quot;. This is Pacino&#x27;s first television series since &quot;Angels in America&quot; (2003). &quot;Hunters&quot; was renewed for a second season in August 2020. In 2021, Pacino played Aldo Gucci in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;House of Gucci&quot;. The film received mixed to positive reviews, with Pacino&#x27;s performance being highlighted as a standout, along with Lady Gaga&#x27;s and Jared Leto&#x27;s. That same year, he played the lead defense attorney in &quot;American Traitor: The Trial of Axis Sally&quot;. 

In 2024, Pacino starred in &quot;Modì, Three Days on the Wing of Madness&quot;, a film about Amedeo Modigliani, which he co-produced alongside Johnny Depp and Barry Navidi. The film is based on a play by Dennis McIntyre, which was previously adapted for the 2004 film of the same name. Principal photography commenced in September 2023. On March 10, 2024, Pacino presented the Academy Award for Best Picture at the 96th Academy Awards.

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships ===
Pacino has four children. The eldest, Julie Marie (born October 16, 1989), is his daughter with acting coach Jan Tarrant. He has twins, son Anton James and daughter Olivia Rose (born January 25, 2001), with actress Beverly D&#x27;Angelo, with whom he had a relationship from 1997 until 2003. He has a son, Roman (born June 15, 2023) with his producer girlfriend Noor Alfallah, who is 53 years younger than he is. Pacino, at age 83, is one of the oldest fathers on record. He has never been married.

Pacino had a relationship with his &quot;The Godfather Trilogy&quot; co-star Diane Keaton. Their on-again, off-again relationship ended after the filming of &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;. Keaton said of Pacino, &quot;Al was simply the most entertaining man... To me, that&#x27;s, that is the most beautiful face. I think Warren [Beatty] was gorgeous, very pretty, but Al&#x27;s face is like whoa. Killer, killer face.&quot; He has had relationships with Jill Clayburgh, Tuesday Weld, Marthe Keller, Veruschka von Lehndorff, Kathleen Quinlan, Lyndall Hobbs, and Penelope Ann Miller. Pacino had a ten-year relationship with Argentine actress Lucila Polak from 2008 to 2018.

=== Substance abuse issues ===
Pacino has admitted to abusing drugs and alcohol early in his career, partly because he found his sudden fame after &quot;The Godfather&quot; difficult to cope with. He achieved sobriety in 1977.

===Health===
Pacino revealed in 2024 that he almost died of COVID-19 in 2020; his near-death experience has led him to believe in no afterlife after death.

== Acting credits and accolades ==
Pacino has won and been nominated for many awards during his acting career, including nine Oscar nominations (winning one) and five BAFTA nominations (winning one) for his film work; 19 Golden Globe nominations (winning four) and seven SAG Award nominations (winning two), each recognizing both his film and TV work; three Primetime Emmy Award nominations (winning two) solely for his work on television; and three Tony Award nominations (winning two) for his stage work. In 2007, the American Film Institute awarded Pacino with a lifetime achievement award and, in 2003, British television viewers voted Pacino as the greatest film star of all time in a poll for Channel 4.

<text>Dick Tracy is an American comic strip featuring Dick Tracy, a tough and intelligent police detective created by Chester Gould. It made its debut on Sunday, October 4, 1931, in the &quot;Detroit Mirror&quot;, and was distributed by the Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate. Gould wrote and drew the strip until 1977, and various artists and writers have continued it. 

Dick Tracy has also been the hero in a number of films, including &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (1990) in which Warren Beatty played the lead.

Tom De Haven praised Gould&#x27;s &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; as an &quot;outrageously funny American Gothic&quot;, while Brian Walker described it as a &quot;ghoulishly entertaining creation&quot; which had &quot;gripping stories filled with violence and pathos&quot;.

==Comic strip==
===Creation and early years===
Basing the character on U.S. federal agent Eliot Ness, Gould drafted an idea for a detective named &quot;Plainclothes Tracy&quot; and sent it to Joseph Medill Patterson of the Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate. Patterson suggested changing the hero&#x27;s name to Dick Tracy, and he also put forward an opening storyline in which Tracy joined the police after his girlfriend&#x27;s father was murdered by robbers. Gould agreed to these ideas, and &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; was first published on October 4, 1931. The strip was instantly popular and was soon appearing in newspapers across the United States. The strip&#x27;s popularity also resulted in the creation of numerous &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; merchandise, including novelizations, toys, and games. In April 1937, a poll of adult comic strip readers in &quot;Fortune&quot; voted &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; their third favorite comic strip after &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; and &quot;Popeye&quot;. However, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; was also attacked by some journalists as being too violent, a criticism that would dog Gould throughout his time on the strip.

===Evolution of the strip===

On January 13, 1946, the two-Way Wrist Radio was introduced; it would become one of the strip&#x27;s most immediately recognizable icons. This radio wristwatch, worn by Tracy and members of the police force, inspired Martin Cooper&#x27;s invention of the mobile phone and may have inspired later smartwatches. The two-Way Wrist Radio was upgraded to a two-Way Wrist TV in 1964. This development also led to the introduction of an important supporting character, Diet Smith, an eccentric industrialist who financed the development of this equipment.

In late 1948, a botched security detail led to the death of the semi-regular character Brilliant, the blind inventor of the Two-Way Wrist Radio (among other devices) whereupon Chief Brandon, Dick Tracy&#x27;s superior on the police force and a presence in the strip since 1931, resigned in shame and Pat Patton (the &quot;o&quot; in this surname has since been replaced by an &quot;e&quot;) was promoted to police chief in Brandon&#x27;s place on Tracy&#x27;s recommendation after declining promotion himself, previously having been Tracy&#x27;s buffoonish partner. A new character was introduced in December of 1948 named Sam Catchem to take Patton&#x27;s place as Tracy&#x27;s sidekick.

===The 1950s===
Gould introduced topical story lines about television, juvenile delinquency, graft, organized crime, and other developments in American life during the 1950s; elements of soap opera depicted Dick, Tess, and Junior (along with the Tracys&#x27; baby daughter Bonnie Braids) at home as a family. Depictions of family life alternated with the story&#x27;s crime drama, as in the kidnapping of Bonnie Braids by fugitive Crewy Lou, or Junior&#x27;s girlfriend Model being accidentally killed by her brother.

Gould incurred some controversy when he had Tracy live in an unaccountably ostentatious manner on a police officer&#x27;s salary, and he responded with a story wherein Tracy was accused of corruption and had to explain the origin of his possessions in detail. In his book-length examination of the strip, &quot;Dick Tracy – The Official Biography&quot;, Jay Maeder suggested that Gould&#x27;s critics were unsatisfied by his explanation. Nevertheless, the controversy eventually faded, and the cartoonist reduced exposure to Tracy&#x27;s home life.

Tracy&#x27;s cases generally incriminated independent operators rather than organized crime—with a few exceptions, such as Big Boy, a fictionalized version of Al Capone and the strip&#x27;s first villain. Tracy contended with a series of big-time mobsters in the 1950s, such as the King, George &quot;Mr. Crime&quot; Alpha, Odds Zonn, and Willie &quot;The Fifth&quot; Millyun, after events like the Kefauver Hearings. As Tess faded into the background, Tracy took, as his assistant, the rookie policewoman Lizz Worthington, a photographer who becomes a highly capable police officer, which was a rare female character type for its time.

From 1956 to 1964, the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; Sunday page was accompanied by a topper humor strip called &quot;The Gravies&quot; and drawn by Gould and his assistants.

The 1950s are often considered the strip&#x27;s artistic and commercial prime, which is thought to come to an end with the 1959 story with the villains The Fifth and his colleague, Flyface. In that story, The Fifth was Gould&#x27;s criticism of the constitutional right to silence with the gangster invoking that right for any question, which his cohort and legal representation, Flyface, was a caricature of lawyers as a repellent man constantly swarmed by flies as was most of his family as well. In that story, Gould&#x27;s creative weaknesses began to become more obvious with his vitriolic overlong condemnation of the rights of the accused and any new restraint on police practices no matter how justified, while his grotesque style for his villain characters began to alienate contemporary readers enough to prompt newspapers to drop the strip.

===Space period===
As technology progressed, the methods that Tracy and the police used to track and capture criminals took the form of increasingly fanciful atomic-powered gadgets developed by Diet Smith Industries. This eventually led to the 1960s advent of the Space Coupe, a spacecraft with a magnetic propulsion system. This marked the beginning of the strip&#x27;s &quot;Space Period,&quot; which saw Tracy and friends having adventures on the Moon and meeting Moon Maid, the daughter of the leader of a race of humanoid people living in &quot;Moon Valley&quot; in 1964. After an eventual sharing of technological information, Moon technology became standard issue on Tracy&#x27;s police force, including air cars, flying cylindrical vehicles. The villains became even more exaggerated in power, resulting in an escalating series of stories that no longer resembled the urban crime drama roots of the strip. During this period, Tracy met famed cartoonist Chet Jade, creator of the comic strip &quot;Sawdust&quot;, in which the only characters are talking dots.

One of the new characters, Mr. Intro, was only manifested as a disembodied voice. His goal was world domination in the vein of a James Bond villain. Tracy eventually used an atomic laser beam to annihilate Intro and his island base.

Junior married Moon Maid in October 1964. Their daughter Honey Moon Tracy had antennae and magnetic hands. In the spring of 1969, Tracy was offered the post of Chief of Police in Moon Valley. However, he ended up back on Earth when the Apollo 11 mission in 1969 showed that the moon was barren of all life. Many of the accoutrements of the space period stories remained for many years afterward, such as the Space Coupe and much of the high-tech gadgetry. Moon Maid receded from the storyline.

The stories of this period took an increasingly condemnatory tone pertaining to contemporary court decisions concerning the rights of the accused, which often involved Tracy being frustrated by legal technicalities. For example, having caught a gang of diamond thieves red-handed, Tracy was forced to let them walk because he could not &quot;prove&quot; beyond a reasonable doubt that the diamonds were stolen. As he saw the thieves get off without penalty, Tracy was heard to grumble, &quot;Yes, under today&#x27;s interpretation of the laws, it seems it&#x27;s the police who are handcuffed!&quot;

The strip was criticized for advocating violence. For instance, Moon Maid, incensed at a woman being attacked by a criminal and no one helping her in an obvious reference of the Murder of Kitty Genovese, becomes a mysterious murderous vigilante to Dick Tracy&#x27;s open approval in violation of his profession&#x27;s ethics In 1968. On June 7 — the day after Senator Robert F. Kennedy was killed by an assassin — the strip&#x27;s final panel announced, &quot;Violence is golden, when it&#x27;s used to put down evil.&quot; The strip was obviously prepared weeks before the assassination, but the timing of the strip&#x27;s publication attracted negative attention. Some newspapers dropped the strip as a result. From 1960 to 1974, the strip&#x27;s newspaper coverage dropped from 550 to roughly 375

===1970s===

In the 1970s, Gould modernized Tracy by giving him a longer hairstyle and a mustache and added a hippie sidekick, Groovy Grove, to appeal to young audiences. Groovy&#x27;s first appearance in print, as it happened, occurred during the same week as the Kent State shootings. Groovy remained with the strip on and off until his death in 1984.

Shortly before his retirement, Gould drew a strip in which Sam, Lizz, and Groovy held Tracy down to shave off his mustache.

At this time, the standard publication size and space of newspaper comics was sharply reduced; for example, the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; Sunday strip, which had traditionally been a full-page episode containing 12 panels, was cut in size to a half-page format that offered, at most, eight panels—these new restrictions created challenges for all comic artists.

===Plenty family===
The Plenty family was a group of goofy redneck yokels headed by the former villain Bob Oscar (&quot;B.O.&quot;), along with Gertrude (&quot;Gravel Gertie&quot;) Plenty. Gravel Gertie was introduced as the unwitting dupe of the villain the Brow, who was on the run from Dick Tracy. The family provided a humorous counterpoint to Tracy&#x27;s adventures. The Plenty sub-story was decades long and saw Sparkle Plenty grow from an infant to a young married lady, eventually becoming a beautiful fashion model. Sparkle Plenty&#x27;s 30 May 1947 birth became a significant mainstream media event, with spinoff merchandising and magazine coverage.

The Plenty family appeared with Tracy in a story that occurred in a bank, where &quot;B.O.&quot; found a way to prevent thieves from snatching an envelope of money from a counter.

In the 24 April 2011 strip, B.O. and Gertie had a second child, Attitude, a boy who is as ugly as Sparkle is beautiful. His face has yet to be shown.

===Crimestoppers&#x27; Textbook===
Beginning September 11, 1949, the Sunday strip included a frame devoted to a page from the &quot;Crimestoppers&#x27; Textbook&quot;, a series of handy illustrated hints for the amateur crime-fighter. This was named after a short-lived youth group seen in the strip during the late 1940s, led by Junior Tracy, called &quot;Dick Tracy&#x27;s Crimestoppers.&quot; This feature ended when Gould retired from the strip in 1977, but Max Allan Collins reinstated it, and it is still part of the strip. After Gould&#x27;s retirement, Collins initially replaced the Textbook with &quot;Dick Tracy&#x27;s Rogues Gallery,&quot; a salute to memorable &quot;Tracy&quot; villains of the past.

===After Gould===

Chester Gould retired from comics in 1977; his last &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; strip appeared in print on Sunday, December 25 (Christmas Day) of that same year. The following Monday, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; was taken over by Max Allan Collins and longtime Gould assistant Rick Fletcher. Gould&#x27;s name remained in the byline for a few years after his retirement as a story consultant.

In one of Collins&#x27; first stories as the strip&#x27;s writer, the gangster known as &quot;Big Boy&quot; learned that he was dying and had less than a year to live. Big Boy was still seeking revenge on Tracy, who had sent him up the river to prison,?and he wanted to live just long enough to see Tracy&#x27;s death. He put out an open $1 million contract on Tracy worth, knowing that every small-time hood in the city would take a crack at the famous cop for that amount of money. One of the would-be collectors rigged Tracy&#x27;s car to explode, but inadvertently killed Moon Maid instead of Tracy in the explosion. A funeral strip for Moon Maid explicitly stated that this officially severed all ties between Earth and the Moon in the strip, thus eliminating the last remnants of the Space Period. Honeymoon received a new hairstyle that covered her antennae and she was ultimately phased out of the strip. Junior later married Sparkle Plenty (the daughter of B.O. and &#x27;Gravel&#x27; Gertie Plenty), and they had a daughter named Sparkle Plenty Jr. Sparkle had been divorced by her cartoonist husband Vera Aldid, who was thus also removed from the cast. Collins felt that their original marriages were a mistake on Gould&#x27;s part. In the 1990s, Tracy&#x27;s son Joseph Flintheart Tracy took on a role similar to Junior&#x27;s in the earlier strips.

In addition, Collins removed other Gould creations of the 1960s and 1970s (including Groovy Grove, who was gravely wounded in the line of duty and later died in the hospital; Lizz married him before his death). On a more philosophical level, Collins took a generally less cynical view of the justice system than Gould; Tracy came to accept its limitations and requirements as a normal part of the process which he could manage. Extreme technology was phased out, such as the Space Coupe, in favor of more realistic advanced tools such as the Two-Way Wrist Computer in 1987.

New semi-regular characters introduced by Collins and Fletcher included: Dr. Will Carver, a plastic surgeon with underworld ties who often worked on known felons; Wendy Wichel, a smarmy newspaper reporter/editorialist with a strong anti-Tracy bias in her articles; and Lee Ebony, an African-American female detective. Vitamin Flintheart reappeared occasionally as a comic-relief figure, the aged ham actor created by Gould in 1944 who had not been seen in the strip for almost three decades. The Plenty family (B.O., Gravel Gertie, and Sparkle) were also brought back as semi-regulars.

Original villains seen during this period included Angeltop (the revenge-seeking, psychopathic daughter of the slain Flattop), Torcher (whose scheme was arson-for-profit), and Splitscreen (a video pirate). Collins brought back at least one &quot;classic&quot; Gould villain or revenge-seeking family member per year. The revived Gould villains were often provided with full names and marriages, as well as children, and other family connections were developed, bringing more humanity to many of the originally grotesque brutes. &quot;Flattop&quot;, particularly, had a number of relatives, all with his characteristic head structure and facial attributes, who turned up one by one to avenge their ancestor on Tracy.

Rick Fletcher died in 1983 and was succeeded by editorial cartoonist Dick Locher, who had assisted Gould on the strip in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Locher was assisted by his son John, who died in 1986.

Max Allan Collins was fired from the strip in 1992, following a financial reorganization of their comic strip holdings, and &quot;Tribune&quot; staff writer and columnist Mike Kilian took over the writing. Kilian continued until his death on October 27, 2005.

=== 2000s ===
Dick Locher was both author and artist for over three years, beginning on January 9, 2006. On March 16, 2009, Jim Brozman began collaborating with Locher, taking over the drawing duties while Locher continued to write the strip.

In 2005, Tracy was a guest at Blondie and Dagwood&#x27;s 75th anniversary party in the comic strip &quot;Blondie&quot;. Later, Dick Tracy appeared in the comic strip &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot;.

On January 19, 2011, Tribune Media Services announced that Locher was retiring from the strip and handing the reins to artist Joe Staton and writer Mike Curtis. The new creative team has previously worked together on &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, &quot;Richie Rich&quot;, and&quot; Casper the Friendly Ghost&quot;. Their first Dick Tracy strip was published March 14, 2011. Until Staton&#x27;s retirement in October 2021, Staton and Curtis were assisted by Shelley Pleger, who inked and lettered Staton&#x27;s drawings, along with Shane Fisher, who provides the coloring on the Sunday strips. After Staton&#x27;s retirement, Pleger took over his artist duties, too, having previously substituted for him in 2017. Pleger was in turn succeeded by Charles Ettinger in February 2024. Chicago-area police sergeant Jim Doherty provided &quot;Crimestopper&quot; captions for the Sunday strips and acted as the feature&#x27;s technical advisor. Doherty also introduced a new feature, &quot;Tracy&#x27;s Hall of Fame&quot; (which replaces the &quot;Crimestopper&quot; panel approximately once each month), in which a real-life police officer is profiled and honored. Doherty was replaced in 2016 by police lieutenant Walter Reimer, who introduced the &quot;First Responders Roll of Honor&quot;, which honors real-life police officers, firefighters, and paramedics who died on duty.

Staton and Curtis reintroduced many of the characters of the ‘40s through the ‘60s, including a second Mr. Crime and a reformed Mole, while introducing more deformed and grotesque villains such as Abner Kadaver, Panda, and the Jumbler. They also brought back all the gadgets and plot elements of the 1960s space era, starting in early 2013, although the reintroduced Moon Maid is not the same as the original; rather, she is a human genetically modified to resemble the original Moon Maid and, thus, is christened Mysta Chimera and placed under Diet Smith&#x27;s care. They have also done crossovers, with cameos from &quot;Popeye&quot;, &quot;Brenda Starr, Reporter&quot;, &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot;, &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot;, &quot;The Spirit&quot;, &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot;, &quot;Friday Foster&quot;, and several long sequences involving &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Chester Gould won the Reuben Award for the strip in 1959 and 1977.

The Mystery Writers of America honored Gould and his work with a Special Edgar Award in 1980. This was the first time MWA ever honored a comic strip.

In 1995, the strip was one of 20 included in the Comic Strip Classics series of commemorative postage stamps and postcards.

On May 2, 2011, the Tennessee Senate passed Resolution 30, congratulating Mike Curtis and Joe Staton on their professional accomplishments, including &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;.

On September 7, 2013, at the Baltimore Comics Convention, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; was awarded the Harvey in the &quot;Best Syndicated Strip or Panel&quot; category. &quot;Tracy&quot; was simultaneously the oldest continually running strip and the first adventure strip ever to win the Harvey Award in this category. On September 6, 2014, &quot;Tracy&quot; was awarded a second Harvey Award in the newspaper strip category, becoming one of only three strips to win in this category in consecutive years. On September 26, 2015, &quot;Tracy&quot; won a third Harvey in the same category, becoming one of only three strips to win in three consecutive years.

On November 6, 2016, at their panel at Akron Comicon, Mike Curtis and Joe Staton were each presented with an Akron Comicon Excellence Award. The inscription on the plaques reads: &quot;2016 AKRON COMICON EXCELLENCE AWARD PRESENTED TO MIKE CURTIS AND JOE STATON FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO ONE OF THE LONGEST RUNNING NEWSPAPER STRIPS IN THE HISTORY OF NEWSPAPER COMICS!&quot;

==In other media==
===Radio===
&quot;Dick Tracy&quot; had a long run on radio, from 1934 weekdays on NBC&#x27;s New England stations to the ABC network in 1948. Bob Burlen was the first radio Tracy in 1934, and others heard in the role during the 1930s and 1940s were Barry Thomson, Ned Wever and Matt Crowley. The early shows all had 15-minute episodes.

On CBS, with Sterling Products as sponsor, the serial aired four times a week from February 4, 1935, to July 11, 1935, moving to Mutual from September 30, 1935, to March 24, 1937, with Bill McClintock doing the sound effects. NBC&#x27;s weekday afternoon run from January 3, 1938, to April 28, 1939, had sound effects by Keene Crockett and was sponsored by Quaker Oats, which brought &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; into primetime (Saturdays at 7 pm and, briefly, Mondays at 8 pm) with 30-minute episodes from April 29, 1939, to September 30, 1939. The series returned to 15-minute episodes on the ABC Blue Network from March 15, 1943, to July 16, 1948, sponsored by Tootsie Roll, which used the music theme of &quot;Toot Toot, Tootsie&quot; for its 30-minute Saturday ABC series from October 6, 1945, to June 1, 1946. Sound effects on ABC were supplied by Walt McDonough and Al Finelli.

On February 15, 1945, &quot;Command Performance&quot; broadcast the musical comedy &quot;Dick Tracy in B-Flat&quot; with Bing Crosby as Tracy, Bob Hope as Flattop, Dinah Shore as Tess Trueheart, among the cast. Dick Tracy&#x27;s wedding is repeatedly interrupted as Tracy chases after one villain after another. In the strip, his marriage wasn&#x27;t until 1950 and his honeymoon was disrupted by his going after Wormy.

===Recordings===
Jim Ameche portrayed Tracy in a two-record set recorded by Mercury Records in 1947. The record sleeves were illustrated with Sunday strips reprinted in black-and-white for children to color.

===Comic books===

Tracy made his first comic book appearance in 1936 as one of the features included in the first issue of Dell&#x27;s &quot;Popular Comics&quot;. These were reprints from the newspaper strip, reconfigured to fit the pages of a comic book, as was the case with most Tracy comic book appearances. Tracy remained a regular feature in &quot;Popular Comics&quot; through the publication&#x27;s 21st issue.

The first comic book to feature Tracy exclusively was the &quot;Dick Tracy Feature Book&quot;, published in May 1937 by David McKay Publications. McKay&#x27;s Feature Books were magazines that rotated several popular characters from comics strips through 1938. Three more of McKay&#x27;s Feature Books starred Tracy in the following months.

In 1939, Dell started a comic magazine series called &quot;Black and White Comics,&quot; essentially identical to McKay&#x27;s &quot;Feature Books.&quot; Six of the 15 issues featured Tracy. In 1941, Dell&#x27;s &quot;Black and White&quot; series was replaced by the &quot;Large Feature Books,&quot; the third issue of which featured Tracy. As with the McKay series, the Dell &quot;Black and White&quot; and &quot;Large Feature&quot; series were abridged reprints of the strip.

In 1938, &quot;Tracy&quot; became one of several regular newspaper strips featured in Dell&#x27;s regular monthly &quot;Super Comics&quot;, remaining a regular part of that publication until 1948. In 1939, &quot;Tracy&quot; was the sole feature in the very first issue of Dell&#x27;s &quot;Four-Color Comics&quot;, which put out more than 1,300 issues starring hundreds of characters between 1939 and 1962. Tracy was featured in seven more &quot;Four-Color&quot; issues throughout the 1940s.

Tracy was frequently featured in comic books used as promotional items by various companies. In 1947, for example, Sig Feuchtwanger produced a comic book that was a giveaway prize in boxes of Quaker Puffed Wheat cereal, sponsor of the popular &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; radio series.

In January 1948, Dell began the first regular &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; comic book series, &quot;Dick Tracy Monthly&quot;. This series ultimately ran for 145 issues, the first 24 of which were published by Dell, after which it was picked up by Harvey Comics. Continuing the same numbering, Harvey published the series until 1961. As with most previous Tracy comic book incarnations, these were, with the exception of the last few Dell issues which featured original material, slightly abridged and reconfigured reprints of the newspaper strips.

&quot;Dick Tracy&quot; was revived in 1986 by Blackthorne Publishing which began as a monthly series (also called &quot;Dick Tracy Monthly&quot;) but became a weekly one (&quot;Dick Tracy Weekly&quot;) with issue 25 and lasted 99 issues. Disney produced a series of three issues as a tie-in for their 1990 film. This miniseries, &quot;True Hearts and Tommy Guns&quot;, was drawn by Kyle Baker and edited by Len Wein. The third issue was a direct adaptation of the film.

In 2018, IDW Publishing announced a new &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; comic book by Mike Allred (co-writer/cover artist/inker), Lee Allred (co-writer), Rich Tommaso (penciller) and Laura Allred (colorist).

===Books===

===Film===
====Film serials====
Dick Tracy made his film debut in &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (1937), a 15-chapter movie serial by Republic Pictures starring Ralph Byrd. The Spider Gang was on the loose, tired of Dick Tracy&#x27;s cunning skills. Through the 15-chapter serial, 15 different cases were solved, all plots by the Spider Gang. Dick Tracy was also in search of his missing brother, Gordon Tracy (Carleton Young). The Dick Tracy character proved very popular, and a second serial, &quot;Dick Tracy Returns&quot;, appeared in 1938 (reissued in 1948). &quot;Dick Tracy&#x27;s G-Men&quot; was released in 1939 (reissued in 1955). The last was &quot;Dick Tracy vs. Crime Inc.&quot; in 1941 (reissued as &quot;Dick Tracy vs. the Phantom Empire&quot; in 1952).

The sequels were produced under an interpretation of the contract for the first &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; serial, which gave license for &quot;a series or serial&quot;. As a result, Chester Gould received no further money for the sequel serials.

Dick Tracy is portrayed as an FBI agent, or &quot;G-Man&quot;, based in California rather than as a detective in the police force of a Midwestern city resembling Chicago, and, aside from himself and Junior, no characters from the strip appear in any of the four serials.

However, comic relief sidekick &quot;Mike McGurk&quot; bears some resemblance to Tracy&#x27;s partner from the strip, Pat Patton; Tracy&#x27;s secretary, Gwen Andrews (played by several actresses in the course of the series, including Jennifer Jones under a variation of her real name, Phyllis Isley), provides the same kind of feminine interest as Tess Trueheart; and FBI Director Clive Anderson (Francis X. Bushman and others) is the same kind of avuncular superior as Chief Brandon.

The first serial, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, is now in the public domain.

====Early feature films====
Four years after the release of the final Republic serial, Dick Tracy would headline the first of four feature films, produced by RKO Radio Pictures. &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Dick Tracy, Detective&quot;) (1945) was followed by &quot;Dick Tracy vs. Cueball&quot; in 1946, both with Morgan Conway as Tracy. Ralph Byrd returned for the last two features, both released in 1947: &quot;Dick Tracy&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; and &quot;Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome&quot;. &quot;Gruesome&quot; is probably the best known of the four, with the villain portrayed by Boris Karloff. All four movies had many of the visual features associated with film noir: dramatic, shadowy photographic compositions, with many exterior scenes filmed at night (at the RKO Encino movie ranch). Lyle Latell co-starred in all four films as Pat Patton. Anne Jeffreys played Tess Trueheart in the first two, succeeded by Kay Christopher and finally Anne Gwynne; Ian Keith joined the cast as the actor Vitamin Flintheart for two films; Joseph Crehan played Chief Brandon. RKO stocked the films with familiar faces, creating a veritable rogues&#x27; gallery of characters: Mike Mazurki as Splitface, Dick Wessel as Cueball, Esther Howard as Filthy Flora, Jack Lambert as hook-handed villain the Claw; baldheaded, pop-eyed Milton Parsons, mild-mannered Byron Foulger, dangerous Trevor Bardette and pockmarked, gently sinister Skelton Knaggs.

====1990 feature film====

Warren Beatty produced, directed, co-wrote (uncredited), and starred in the 1990 film &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, whose supporting cast includes Al Pacino, Madonna, Glenne Headly, and Charlie Korsmo. &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; depicts the detective&#x27;s romantic relationships with Breathless Mahoney and Tess Trueheart, as well as his conflicts with crime boss Alphonse &quot;Big Boy&quot; Caprice and his henchmen. Tracy also begins fostering a young street urchin named Kid. Development of the film began in the early 1980s with Tom Mankiewicz assigned to write the script. The screenplay was written instead by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr., both of &quot;Top Gun&quot; fame. The project also went through directors (Steven Spielberg, John Landis, Walter Hill, and Richard Benjamin) before the arrival of Beatty. It was filmed mainly at Universal Studios. Danny Elfman was hired to compose the score, and the film&#x27;s music and songs were featured on three separate soundtrack albums.

The strip has had limited exposure on television with one early live-action series, two animated series, one unsold pilot that was never picked up, and a proposed TV series currently held up in litigation.

====First live action series====

Ralph Byrd, who had played the square-jawed sleuth in all four Republic movie serials and two of the RKO feature-length films, reprised his role in a short-lived live action &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; series that ran on ABC from 1950 to 1951. Additional episodes intended for first-run syndication continued to be produced into 1952. Produced by P. K. Palmer, who also wrote many of the scripts, the series often featured Gould-created villains such as Flattop, Shaky, the Mole, Breathless Mahoney, Heels Beals and Influence, all of whom appeared on film for the first time on this series. Other cast members included Joe Devlin as Sam Catchem, Angela Greene as Tess Tracy (née Trueheart), Martin Dean as Junior, and Pierre Watkin as Chief Patton. Criticized for its violence, the series remained popular. It ended, not in response to criticism, but because of Byrd&#x27;s unexpected, premature death in 1952. The series was filmed on a low budget, with many long hours and a rushed shooting schedule. Many episodes of this series have been released on various public domain TV detective DVD sets.

====Animated cartoons====
The first cartoon series was produced from 1960 to 1961 by UPA. Tracy employed a series of cartoon-like subordinate flatfoots to fight crime each week, contacting them on his two-way wrist radio. Everett Sloane voiced Tracy and supporting characters and villains were voiced by Jerry Hausner, Mel Blanc, Benny Rubin, Johnny Coons, Paul Frees and others. These subordinates included &quot;Go-Go&quot; Gomez, Joe Jitsu, Hemlock Holmes and the Retouchables, and Officer Heap O&#x27;Calorie. 130 five-minute cartoons were designed and packaged for syndication, usually intended for local children&#x27;s shows.

UPA was also the production company behind the Mr. Magoo cartoons, so it was possible for them to arrange a meeting between Tracy and Magoo in a 1965 episode of the season-long TV series &quot;The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo&quot;. In the episode &quot;Dick Tracy and the Mob&quot;, Tracy persuades Magoo (a well-known actor in the context of the &quot;Famous Adventures&quot; series) to impersonate an international hit man named Squinty Eyes, who he resembles, and infiltrate a gang of criminals made up of Flattop, Pruneface, Itchy, Mumbles and others. Unlike the earlier animated Tracy shorts, this longer episode was played relatively straight, with Tracy getting much more screen time. Pitting Tracy against a coalition of several of his foes was adopted more than two decades later in the 1990 film.

A second cartoon series was produced in 1971 and was a feature in &quot;Archie&#x27;s TV Funnies&quot;, produced by Filmation. It adhered more closely to the comic strip, although it was hampered by cruder animation than the UPA shorts, typical of the studio&#x27;s production standards.

====Live action television pilot====

William Dozier produced a pilot for a live action Dick Tracy series in 1967 starring Ray MacDonnell in the title role. (Dozier was the producer responsible for the 1966 &quot;Batman&quot; TV series.) The pilot was &quot;The Plot to Kill NATO&quot;, featuring &quot;Special Guest Villain&quot; Victor Buono as &#x27;Mr. Memory&#x27;. The series was not purchased by either ABC or NBC. Eve Plumb, who would later find fame as Jan Brady on &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, is credited as Bonnie Braids, who does not appear in the pilot, nor does Davey Davison as Tess.

===Licensed products===
In the 1960s, Aurora produced a plastic model kit of Dick Tracy sliding down a fire escape ladder into an alley, in hot pursuit with gun drawn. A Dick Tracy Space Coupe model came next. Both have been reissued by Polar Lights. Also in the market were Mattel&#x27;s Dick Tracy range of toy guns.

In 1990, Playmates Toys released a line of action figures called &quot;Dick Tracy: Coppers and Gangsters&quot; to coincide with the Dick Tracy movie. The figures were 5&quot; tall, stylized with exaggerated comic looks and was accompanied by many accessories. Two figures in the line had limited availability; Steve the Tramp (called &quot;The Tramp&quot; on the package front) was pulled from the assortment after complaints of portrayal of a homeless person as a criminal. The figure of &quot;The Blank&quot; was added to the assortment well after the film&#x27;s release to keep the secret of the identity of the character. As a result, only limited quantities of these two figures made it to store shelves.

Various distinct video games tied in with the film were developed. Titus Software did versions many platforms including Amiga, Commodore and MS-DOS. &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; is a side scrolling action shooting game. The player controls Dick Tracy through five stages. The Commodore 64 version is infamous for being released in an unfinished state (minimal animation for the main character, missing headlines in the linking screens, flick scrolling), and scored Commodore Format magazine&#x27;s lowest ever review score of 11%. There were also games made for the Nintendo Entertainment System (1990), Master System (1990), Sega Genesis (1990), and Game Boy (1991)., and a graphic adventure for MS-DOS and the Amiga.

In 2009, Shocker Toys released a monochromatic Dick Tracy action figure as an exclusive product for San Diego Comic-Con. The figure appears in a suit with two-way wrist radio. There was also a variant figure released of Dick Tracy in his signature trench coat and fedora with a tommy gun accessory.

===Rights to adapt in other media===
Media outlets reported a legal battle being waged over rights to the Dick Tracy character. Warren Beatty announced plans to make a sequel to his 1990 movie. At the same time, television producers announced plans for a new &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; TV series. Both sides claimed that they were the legal owners of the rights to Dick Tracy. In May 2005, Beatty sued the Tribune Company, claiming he has owned the rights to the Dick Tracy character since 1985. Pressure from Beatty led to the cancellation of a proposed collaboration between artist Mike Oeming and writer Brian Bendis on a new serialized Dick Tracy comic.

The lawsuit was resolved in Beatty&#x27;s favor, with a U.S. District judge ruling that Beatty did everything contractually required of him to keep the rights to the character. Beatty has maintained the rights to Tracy since then by producing two made-for-TV specials, which regarded as having minimal artistic value. While the first special is believed to have been part of the rights battle, the second special does not seem to have had a direct legal impetus, as Dick Tracy will enter the public domain in 2027.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; is a long-running parody of Dick Tracy that appeared intermittently as a strip-within-a-strip in Al Capp&#x27;s satirical hillbilly comic strip, &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (1934–1977).
* Gilbert Shelton parodied Dick Tracy as &quot;Tricky Prickears&quot; in his &quot;Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot; comic strips.
* The artist Jess Collins used an X-Acto knife and rubber cement to reassemble Gould&#x27;s strip into &quot;Tricky Cad&quot; (an anagram of &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;). Gould threatened to sue if the &quot;Tricky Cad&quot; collages were published.
* The UPA version of Dick Tracy (though already having appeared in the novel) was scheduled to appear as a cameo in the deleted scene &quot;Acme&#x27;s Funeral&quot; from the film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.
* Daffy Duck parodied Dick Tracy as &quot;Duck Twacy&quot; in the 1946 &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon &quot;The Great Piggy Bank Robbery&quot;.
* Dick Tracy was parodied by the adult animated stop motion sketch comedy TV show &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; in the season 3 episode &quot;Rabbits on a Roller Coaster&quot;.
* Dick Tracy was parodied in 1990 in the Season 8 episode of &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot;, as &quot;Chip Tracy&quot;.
* A statue of Dick Tracy can be found in Naperville, Illinois, on the city&#x27;s riverwalk. It was erected in honor of longtime Naperville resident Dick Locher, who worked as an assistant to Chester Gould and later drew the comic strip and created the storyline for it.

<text>Key Word In Context (KWIC) is the most common format for concordance lines. The term KWIC was coined by Hans Peter Luhn. The system was based on a concept called &quot;keyword in titles&quot;, which was first proposed for Manchester libraries in 1864 by Andrea Crestadoro.

A KWIC index is formed by sorting and aligning the words within an article title to allow each word (except the stop words) in titles to be searchable alphabetically in the index. It was a useful indexing method for technical manuals before computerized full text search became common.

For example, a search query including all of the words in an example definition (&quot;KWIC is an acronym for Key Word In Context, the most common format for concordance lines&quot;) and the Wikipedia slogan in English (&quot;the free encyclopedia&quot;), searched against a Wikipedia page, might yield a KWIC index as follows. A KWIC index usually uses a wide layout to allow the display of maximum &#x27;in context&#x27; information (not shown in the following example).

A KWIC index is a special case of a &quot;permuted index&quot;. This term refers to the fact that it indexes all cyclic permutations of the headings. Books composed of many short sections with their own descriptive headings, most notably collections of manual pages, often ended with a permuted index section, allowing the reader to easily find a section by any word from its heading. This practice, also known as Key Word Out of Context (KWOC), is no longer common.

This format is extremely useful in that the keyword is easily identified together with its context. ... The Concordance of the Roman Missal is produced in both the KWIC and KWICn formats and is noteworthy in that each word form is listed as it appears in the text, that is, it is un-lemmatized.&quot;

<text>Subscription refers to the process of investors signing up and committing to invest in a financial instrument, before the actual closing of the purchase. The term comes from the Latin word &quot;subscribere&quot;.

==Historical==
===Praenumeration===
An early form of subscription was praenumeration, a common business practice in the 18th-century book trade in Germany. The publisher offered to sell a book that was planned but had not yet been printed, usually at a discount, so as to cover their costs in advance. The business practice was particularly common with magazines, helping to determine in advance how many subscribers there would be. Praenumeration is similar to the recent crowdfunding financing model.

==New issues==

===Subscription agreement===
Subscription to new issues can be covered by a subscription agreement, legally committing the investor to invest in the financial instrument, and committing the company to certain obligations and warranties. In some jurisdictions, it is possible for the issuer and subscriber to use a template subscription agreement as the basis of this agreement, although bespoke contract drafting by a qualified specialist may be required in more complex cases.

===Subscription period===
When a new security is to be issued, investors typically have two weeks to submit their subscription orders. At the end of this subscription period, the issuer announces the offering price and the method of allotment.

===Allotment===
Allotment is a method of distributing securities to investors when an issue has been oversubscribed. At the end of the subscription period, the demand for a new issue can exceed the number of shares or bonds being issued. In such cases, the underwriting bank allots the securities with the approval of the issuer, either by lottery or on the basis of a formula. An allotment formula usually takes into account the issuer&#x27;s preferred target investor groups.

==Oversubscription==
A funding round is oversubscribed when the company has obtained funding commitments from investors that, in aggregate, amount to more money than the company needs or intends to raise. The term may be used informally to describe a state where there is more money available than the company needs.

<text>A capital market is a financial market in which long-term debt (over a year) or equity-backed securities are bought and sold, in contrast to a money market where short-term debt is bought and sold. Capital markets channel the wealth of savers to those who can put it to long-term productive use, such as companies or governments making long-term investments. Financial regulators like Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Bank of England (BoE) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversee capital markets to protect investors against fraud, among other duties.

Transactions on capital markets are generally managed by entities within the financial sector or the treasury departments of governments and corporations, but some can be accessed directly by the public. As an example, in the United States, any American citizen with an internet connection can create an account with TreasuryDirect and use it to buy bonds in the primary market. However, sales to individuals form only a small fraction of the total volume of bonds sold. Various private companies provide browser-based platforms that allow individuals to buy shares and sometimes even bonds in the secondary markets. There are many thousands of such systems, most serving only small parts of the overall capital markets. Entities hosting the systems include investment banks, stock exchanges and government departments. Physically, the systems are hosted all over the world, though they tend to be concentrated in financial centres like London, New York, and Hong Kong.

==Definition==
A capital market can be either a primary market or a secondary market. In a primary market, new stock or bond issues are sold to investors, often via a mechanism known as underwriting. The main entities seeking to raise long-term funds on the primary capital markets are governments (which may be municipal, local or national) and business enterprises (companies). Governments issue only bonds, whereas companies often issue both equity and bonds. The main entities purchasing the bonds or stock on primary markets include pension funds, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, and less commonly wealthy individuals and investment banks trading on their own behalf. In the secondary market, existing securities are sold and bought among investors or traders, usually on an exchange, over-the-counter, or elsewhere. The existence of secondary markets increases the willingness of investors in primary markets, as they know they are likely to be able to swiftly cash out their investments if the need arises.

A second important division falls between the stock markets (for equity securities, also known as shares, where investors acquire ownership of companies) and the bond markets (where investors become creditors).

=== Contrast with money markets===

The money markets are used to raise short-term finance; including loans that are expected to be paid back as early as overnight. In contrast, the &quot;capital markets&quot; are used to raise long-term finance, in the form of shares/equities, and loans that are not expected to be fully paid back for at least a year.

Funds borrowed from money markets are typically used for general operating expenses, to provide liquid assets for brief periods. For example, a company may have inbound payments from customers that have not yet cleared, but need immediate cash to pay its employees. But when a company borrows from the primary capital markets, often the purpose is to invest in additional physical capital goods, which will be used to help increase its income. It can take many months or years before the investment generates sufficient return to pay back its cost, and hence the finance is long term.

Together, money markets and capital markets form the financial markets, as the term is narrowly understood. The capital market is concerned with long-term finance. In the widest sense, it consists of a series of channels through which the savings of individuals and institutions are made available for industrial and commercial enterprises and public authorities. This process of channeling savings into productive investments is crucial for economic growth and development. Moreover, capital markets provide opportunities for both individuals and institutions to diversify their investments, thereby managing risk and potentially enhancing returns over the long term.

=== Capital market versus bank loans===
Normal bank lending is not usually classed as a capital market transaction, even when loans are extended for a period longer than a year. First, these bank loans are not securitized (i.e. they are not packaged into a resaleable security like a share or bond that can be traded on the markets). Second, lending by banks is more heavily regulated than capital market lending. Third, bank depositors tend to be more risk-averse than capital market investors. These three differences all act to limit institutional lending as a source of finance. Two additional differences, this time favoring lending by banks, are that banks are more accessible for small and medium-sized companies, and that they have the ability to create money as they lend. In the 20th century, most company finance apart from share issues was raised by bank loans. But since about 1980 there has been an ongoing trend for disintermediation, where large and creditworthy companies have found they effectively have to pay out less interest if they borrow directly from capital markets rather than from banks. The tendency for companies to borrow from capital markets instead of banks has been especially strong in the United States. According to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, capital markets overtook bank lending as the leading source of long-term finance in 2009, which reflects the risk aversion and bank regulation due to the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

Compared to the United States, companies in the European Union have a greater reliance on bank lending for funding. Efforts to enable companies to raise more funding through capital markets are being coordinated through the EU&#x27;s Capital Markets Union initiative.

==Examples==

=== Government on primary markets ===
When a government wants to raise long-term finance it will often sell bonds in the capital markets. In the 20th and early 21st centuries, many governments would use investment banks to organize the sale of their bonds. The leading bank would underwrite the bonds, and would often head up a syndicate of brokers, some of whom might be based in other investment banks. The syndicate would then sell to various investors. For developing countries, a multilateral development bank would sometimes provide an additional layer of underwriting, resulting in risk being shared between the investment bank(s), the multilateral organization, and the end investors. However, since 1997 it has been increasingly common for governments of the larger nations to bypass investment banks by making their bonds directly available for purchase online. Many governments now sell most of their bonds by computerized auction. Typically, large volumes are put up for sale in one go; a government may only hold a small number of auctions each year. Some governments will also sell a continuous stream of bonds through other channels. The biggest single seller of debt is the U.S. government; there are usually several transactions for such sales every second, which corresponds to the continuous updating of the U.S. real-time debt clock.

===Company on primary markets===
When a company wants to raise money for long-term investment, one of its first decisions is whether to do so by issuing bonds or shares. If it chooses shares, it avoids increasing its debt, and in some cases the new shareholders may also provide non-monetary help, such as expertise or useful contacts. On the other hand, a new issue of shares will dilute the ownership rights of the existing shareholders, and if they gain a controlling interest, the new shareholders may even replace senior managers. From an investor&#x27;s point of view, shares offer the potential for higher returns and capital gains if the company does well. Conversely, bonds are safer if the company does poorly, as they are less prone to severe falls in price, and in the event of bankruptcy, bond owners may be paid something, while shareholders will receive nothing.

When a company raises finance from the primary market, the process is more likely to involve face-to-face meetings than other capital market transactions. Whether they choose to issue bonds or shares, companies will typically enlist the services of an investment bank to mediate between themselves and the market. A team from the investment bank often meets with the company&#x27;s senior managers to ensure their plans are sound. The bank then acts as an underwriter, and will arrange for a network of brokers to sell the bonds or shares to investors. This second stage is usually done mostly through computerized systems, though brokers will often phone up their favored clients to advise them of the opportunity. Companies can avoid paying fees to investment banks by using a direct public offering, though this is not a common practice as it incurs other legal costs and can take up considerable management time.

===Secondary market trading===
Most capital market transactions take place on the secondary market. On the primary market, each security can be sold only once, and the process to create batches of new shares or bonds is often lengthy due to regulatory requirements. On the secondary markets, there is no limit to the number of times a security can be traded, and the process is usually very quick. Transactions on the secondary market do not directly raise finance, but they do make it easier for companies and governments to raise finance on the primary market, as investors know that if they want to get their money back quickly, they will usually be easily able to re-sell their securities. Sometimes, however, secondary capital market transactions can have a negative effect on the primary borrowers: for example, if a large proportion of investors try to sell their bonds, this can push up the yields for future issues from the same entity. An extreme example occurred shortly after Bill Clinton began his first term as President of the United States; Clinton was forced to abandon some of the spending increases he had promised in his election campaign due to pressure from the bond markets. In the 21st century, several governments have tried to lock in as much as possible of their borrowing into long-dated bonds, so they are less vulnerable to pressure from the markets. Following the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the introduction of quantitative easing further reduced the ability of private actors to push up the yields of government bonds, at least for countries with a central bank able to engage in substantial open market operations.

A variety of different players are active in the secondary markets. Individual investors account for a small proportion of trading, though their share has slightly increased; in the 20th century it was mostly only a few wealthy individuals who could afford an account with a broker, but accounts are now much cheaper and accessible over the internet. There are now numerous small traders who can buy and sell on the secondary markets using platforms provided by brokers which are accessible via web browsers. When such an individual trades on the capital markets, it will often involve a two-stage transaction. First they place an order with their broker, then the broker executes the trade. If the trade can be done on an exchange, the process will often be fully automated. If a dealer needs to manually intervene, this will often mean a larger fee. Traders in investment banks will often make deals on their bank&#x27;s behalf, as well as executing trades for their clients. Investment banks will often have a division (or department) called &quot;capital markets&quot;: staff in this division try to keep aware of the various opportunities in both the primary and secondary markets, and will advise major clients accordingly. Pension and sovereign wealth funds tend to have the largest holdings, though they tend to buy only the highest grade (safest) types of bonds and shares, and some of them do not trade all that frequently. According to a 2012 &quot;Financial Times&quot; article, hedge funds are increasingly making most of the short-term trades in large sections of the capital market (like the UK and US stock exchanges), which is making it harder for them to maintain their historically high returns, as they are increasingly finding themselves trading with each other rather than with less sophisticated investors.

There are several ways to invest in the secondary market without directly buying shares or bonds. A common method is to invest in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. It is also possible to buy and sell derivatives that are based on the secondary market; one of the most common type of these is contracts for difference – these can provide rapid profits, but can also cause buyers to lose more money than they originally invested.

==Size==

All figures given are in billions of US$ and are sourced to the IMF. There is no universally recognized standard for measuring all of these figures, so other estimates may vary. A GDP column is included for comparison.
===Forecasting and analyses===
A great deal of work goes into analysing capital markets and predicting their future movements. This includes academic study; work within the financial industry for the purposes of making money and reducing risk; and work by governments and multilateral institutions for the purposes of regulation and understanding the impact of capital markets on the wider economy. Methods range from the gut instincts of experienced traders, to various forms of stochastic calculus and algorithms such as Stratonovich-Kalman-Bucy filtering algorithm.

==Capital controls==

Capital controls are measures imposed by a state&#x27;s government aimed at managing capital account transactions – in other words, capital market transactions where one of the counter-parties involved is in a foreign country. Whereas domestic regulatory authorities try to ensure that capital market participants trade fairly with each other, and sometimes to ensure institutions like banks do not take excessive risks, capital controls aim to ensure that the macroeconomic effects of the capital markets do not have a negative impact. Most advanced nations like to use capital controls sparingly if at all, as in theory allowing markets freedom is a win-win situation for all involved: investors are free to seek maximum returns, and countries can benefit from investments that will develop their industry and infrastructure. However, sometimes capital market transactions can have a net negative effect: for example, in a financial crisis, there can be a mass withdrawal of capital, leaving a nation without sufficient foreign-exchange reserves to pay for needed imports. On the other hand, if too much capital is flowing into a country, it can increase inflation and the value of the nation&#x27;s currency, making its exports uncompetitive. Countries like India employ capital controls to ensure that their citizens&#x27; money is invested at home rather than abroad.

<text>The primary market is the part of the capital market that deals with the issuance and sale of securities to purchasers directly by the issuer, with the issuer being paid the proceeds. A primary market means the market for new issues of securities, as distinguished from the secondary market, where previously issued securities are bought and sold. A market is primary if the proceeds of sales go to the issuer of the securities sold. Buyers buy securities that were not previously traded.

== Concept ==
In a primary market, companies, governments, or public sector institutions can raise funds through bond issues, and corporations can raise capital through the sale of new stock through an initial public offering (IPO). This is often done through an investment bank or underwriter or finance syndicate of securities dealers. The process of selling new shares to buyers is called underwriting. Dealers earn a commission that is commonly built into the price of the security offering, though it can be found in the prospectus.

IPOs are not the only way new securities are issued. Publicly traded companies can issue new shares in what is called a &quot;primary issue&quot; of debt or stock, which involves the issue by a corporation of its own debt or new stock directly to buyers like pension funds, or to private investors and shareholders.

Since the securities are issued directly by the company to its buyers, the company receives the money and issues new security certificates to the buyers. The primary market plays the crucial function of facilitating capital formation within the economy. The securities issued at the primary market can be issued in &quot;face value&quot;, &quot;premium value,&quot; or &quot;at par value.&quot;

Primary markets create long-term instruments through which corporate entities raise funds from the capital market. It is also known as the New Issue Market (NIM).

Once issued, the securities typically trade thereafter on a secondary market such as a stock exchange, bond market, or derivatives exchange.

== Raising funds ==
Corporate entities raise funds from the primary market in three ways:

# Public issue: a stock exchange lists the securities, and the corporation raises funds through initial public offering (IPO).
# Rights issue: existing shareholders are offered more shares at a discounted price and on a &quot;pro rata&quot; basis.
# Preferential allotment: a corporation issues shares at a price which may or may not be related to the current market price of the same security.

<text>A financial market is a market in which people trade financial securities and derivatives at low transaction costs. Some of the securities include stocks and bonds, raw materials and precious metals, which are known in the financial markets as commodities.

The term &quot;market&quot; is sometimes used for what are more strictly &quot;exchanges&quot;, that is, organizations that facilitate the trade in financial securities, e.g., a stock exchange or commodity exchange. This may be a physical location (such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), London Stock Exchange (LSE), Johannesburg Stock Exchange JSE Limited (JSE), Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) or an electronic system such as NASDAQ. Much trading of stocks takes place on an exchange; still, corporate actions (merger, spinoff) are outside an exchange, while any two companies or people, for whatever reason, may agree to sell the stock from the one to the other without using an exchange.

Trading of currencies and bonds is largely on a bilateral basis, although some bonds trade on a stock exchange, and people are building electronic systems for these as well. There are also global initiatives such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10 which has a target to improve regulation and monitoring of global financial markets.

==Types of financial markets==
Within the financial sector, the term &quot;financial markets&quot; is often used to refer just to the markets that are used to raise finances. For long term finance, they are usually called the capital markets; for short term finance, they are usually called money markets. The money market deals in short-term loans, generally for a period of a year or less. Another common use of the term is as a catchall for all the markets in the financial sector, as per examples in the breakdown below.

* Capital markets which consist of:
**Stock markets, which provide financing through the issuance of shares or common stock, and enable the subsequent trading thereof.
**Bond markets, which provide financing through the issuance of bonds, and enable the subsequent trading thereof.
* Commodity markets, The commodity market is a market that trades in the primary economic sector rather than manufactured products, Soft commodities is a term generally referred as to commodities that are grown, rather than mined such as crops (corn, wheat, soybean, fruit and vegetable), livestock, cocoa, coffee and sugar and Hard commodities is a term generally referred as to commodities that are mined such as gold, gemstones and other metals and generally drilled such as oil and gas.
* Money markets, which provide short term debt financing and investment.
* Derivatives markets, which provide instruments for the management of financial risk.
* Futures markets, which provide standardized forward contracts for trading products at some future date; see also forward market.
* Foreign exchange markets, which facilitate the trading of foreign exchange.
* Cryptocurrency market which facilitate the trading of digital assets and financial technologies. 
* Spot market
* Interbank lending market
The capital markets may also be divided into primary markets and secondary markets. Newly formed (issued) securities are bought or sold in primary markets, such as during initial public offerings. Secondary markets allow investors to buy and sell existing securities. The transactions in primary markets exist between issuers and investors, while secondary market transactions exist among investors.

Liquidity is a crucial aspect of securities that are traded in secondary markets. Liquidity refers to the ease with which a security can be sold without a loss of value. Securities with an active secondary market mean that there are many buyers and sellers at a given point in time. Investors benefit from liquid securities because they can sell their assets whenever they want; an illiquid security may force the seller to get rid of their asset at a large discount.

==Raising capital==
Financial markets attract funds from investors and channels them to corporations—they thus allow corporations to finance their operations and achieve growth. Money markets allow firms to borrow funds on a short-term basis, while capital markets allow corporations to gain long-term funding to support expansion (known as maturity transformation).

Without financial markets, borrowers would have difficulty finding lenders themselves. Intermediaries such as banks, Investment Banks, and Boutique Investment Banks can help in this process. Banks take deposits from those who have money to save on the form of savings a/c. They can then lend money from this pool of deposited money to those who seek to borrow. Banks popularly lend money in the form of loans and mortgages.

More complex transactions than a simple bank deposit require markets where lenders and their agents can meet borrowers and their agents, and where existing borrowing or lending commitments can be sold on to other parties. A good example of a financial market is a stock exchange. A company can raise money by selling shares to investors and its existing shares can be bought or sold.

The following table illustrates where financial markets fit in the relationship between lenders and borrowers:

===Lenders===
The lender temporarily gives money to somebody else, on the condition of getting back the principal amount together with some interest or profit or charge.

====Individuals and doubles====
Many individuals are not aware that they are lenders, but almost everybody does lend money in many ways. A person lends money when he or she:

* Puts money in a savings account at a bank
* Contributes to a pension plan
* Pays premiums to an insurance company
* Invests in government bonds

====Companies====
&quot;Companies&quot; tend to be lenders of capital. When companies have surplus cash that is not needed for a short period of time, they may seek to make money from their cash surplus by lending it via short term markets called money markets. Alternatively, such companies may decide to return the cash surplus to their shareholders (e.g. via a share repurchase or dividend payment).

====Banks====
Banks can be lenders themselves as they are able to create new debt money in the form of deposits.

===Borrowers===

* &quot;Individuals&quot; borrow money via bankers&#x27; loans for short term needs or longer term mortgages to help finance a house purchase.
* &quot;Companies&quot; borrow money to aid short term or long term cash flows. They also borrow to fund modernization or future business expansion. It is common for companies to use mixed packages of different types of funding for different purposes – especially where large complex projects such as company management buyouts are concerned. 
* &quot;Governments&quot; often find their spending requirements exceed their tax revenues. To make up this difference, they need to borrow. Governments also borrow on behalf of nationalized industries, municipalities, local authorities and other public sector bodies. In the UK, the total borrowing requirement is often referred to as the Public sector net cash requirement (PSNCR).

Governments borrow by issuing bonds. In the UK, the government also borrows from individuals by offering bank accounts and Premium Bonds. Government debt seems to be permanent. Indeed, the debt seemingly expands rather than being paid off. One strategy used by governments to reduce the &quot;value&quot; of the debt is to influence &quot;inflation&quot;.

&quot;Municipalities and local authorities&quot; may borrow in their own name as well as receiving funding from national governments. In the UK, this would cover an authority like Hampshire County Council.

&quot;Public Corporations&quot; typically include nationalized industries. These may include the postal services, railway companies and utility companies.

Many borrowers have difficulty raising money locally. They need to borrow internationally with the aid of Foreign exchange markets.

Borrowers having similar needs can form into a group of borrowers. They can also take an organizational form like Mutual Funds. They can provide mortgage on weight basis. The main advantage is that this lowers the cost of their borrowings.

==Derivative products==
During the 1980s and 1990s, a major growth sector in financial markets was the trade in so called derivatives.

In the financial markets, stock prices, share prices, bond prices, currency rates, interest rates and dividends go up and down, creating &quot;risk&quot;. Derivative products are financial products that are used to &quot;control&quot; risk or paradoxically &quot;exploit&quot; risk. It is also called financial economics.

Derivative products or instruments help the issuers to gain an unusual profit from issuing the instruments. For using the help of these products a contract has to be made. Derivative contracts are mainly four types:
# Future
# Forward
# Option
# Swap

Over the past few decades, the derivatives market has increased and become essential to the financial industry. As the market expands, establishing and improving the regulatory framework becomes particularly critical. In response to the systemic risks exposed by the global economic crisis in 2008, essential regulations such as the Dodd-Frank Act (US) and the EU Market Fundamentals Regulation (MiFID II) were enacted.

* The Dodd-Frank Act focuses on increasing transparency and regulating the derivatives market, particularly over-the-counter derivatives transactions, requiring clearing through central counterparties.
* MiFID II enhances the market&#x27;s efficiency, transparency, and fairness, improving transaction transparency and strengthening investor protection.

These regulations have significantly changed the market structure and strengthened supervision and risk management of the derivatives market. Although regulatory measures have enhanced market stability, they have also had a broad impact on market participants&#x27; operating models and strategies.

Seemingly, the most obvious buyers and sellers of currency are importers and exporters of goods. While this may have been true in the distant past, when international trade created the demand for currency markets, importers and exporters now represent only 1/32 of foreign exchange dealing, according to the Bank for International Settlements.

The picture of foreign currency transactions today shows:
* Banks/Institutions
* Speculators
* Government spending (for example, military bases abroad)
* Importers/Exporters
* Tourists

==Analysis of financial markets==
: &quot;See Statistical analysis of financial markets&quot;, &quot;statistical finance&quot;

Much effort has gone into the study of financial markets and how prices vary with time. Charles Dow, one of the founders of Dow Jones &amp; Company and The Wall Street Journal, enunciated a set of ideas on the subject which are now called Dow theory. This is the basis of the so-called technical analysis method of attempting to predict future changes. One of the tenets of &quot;technical analysis&quot; is that market trends give an indication of the future, at least in the short term. The claims of the technical analysts are disputed by many academics, who claim that the evidence points rather to the random walk hypothesis, which states that the next change is not correlated to the last change. The role of human psychology in price variations also plays a significant factor. Large amounts of volatility often indicate the presence of strong emotional factors playing into the price. Fear can cause excessive drops in price and greed can create bubbles. In recent years the rise of algorithmic and high-frequency program trading has seen the adoption of momentum, ultra-short term moving average and other similar strategies which are based on technical as opposed to fundamental or theoretical concepts of market behaviour. For instance, according to a study published by the European Central Bank, high frequency trading has a substantial correlation with news announcements and other relevant public information that are able to create wide price movements (e.g., interest rates decisions, trade of balances etc.)

The scale of changes in price over some unit of time is called the volatility.
It was discovered by Benoit Mandelbrot that changes in prices do not follow a normal distribution, but are rather modeled better by Lévy stable distributions. The scale of change, or volatility, depends on the length of the time unit to a power a bit more than 1/2. Large changes up or down are more likely than what one would calculate using a normal distribution with an estimated standard deviation.

==Financial market slang==

*Poison pill, when a company issues more shares to prevent being bought out by another company, thereby increasing the number of outstanding shares to be bought by the hostile company making the bid to establish majority.
*Bips, meaning &quot;bps&quot; or basis points. A basis point is a financial unit of measurement used to describe the magnitude of percent change in a variable. One basis point is the equivalent of one hundredth of a percent. For example, if a stock price were to rise 100bit/s, it means it would increase 1%. 
* Quant, a quantitative analyst with advanced training in mathematics and statistical methods.
* Rocket scientist, a financial consultant at the zenith of mathematical and computer programming skill. They are able to invent derivatives of high complexity and construct sophisticated pricing models. They generally handle the most advanced computing techniques adopted by the financial markets since the early 1980s. Typically, they are physicists and engineers by training.
*IPO, stands for initial public offering, which is the process a new private company goes through to &quot;go public&quot; or become a publicly traded company on some index. 
* White Knight, a friendly party in a takeover bid. Used to describe a party that buys the shares of one organization to help prevent against a hostile takeover of that organization by another party.

==Components of financial market==

===Based on market levels===
* Primary market: A primary market is a market for new issues or new financial claims. Therefore, it is also called new issue market. The primary market deals with those securities which are issued to the public for the first time.
* Secondary market: A market for secondary sale of securities. In other words, securities which have already passed through the new issue market are traded in this market. Generally, such securities are quoted in the stock exchange and it provides a continuous and regular market for buying and selling of securities.

Simply put, primary market is the market where the newly started company issued shares to the public for the first time through IPO (initial public offering). Secondary market is the market where the second hand securities are sold (security Commodity Markets).

===Based on security types ===
* Money market: Money market is a market for dealing with the financial assets and securities which have a maturity period of up to one year. In other words, it is a market for purely short-term funds.
* Capital market: A capital market is a market for financial assets that have a long or indefinite maturity. Generally, it deals with long-term securities that have a maturity period of above one year. The capital market may be further divided into (a) industrial securities market (b) Govt. securities market and (c) long-term loans market.
** Equity markets: A market where ownership of securities are issued and subscribed is known as equity market. An example of a secondary equity market for shares is the New York (NYSE) stock exchange.
** Debt market: The market where funds are borrowed and lent is known as debt market. Arrangements are made in such a way that the borrowers agree to pay the lender the original amount of the loan plus some specified amount of interest.
* Derivative markets: A market where financial instruments are derived and traded based on an underlying asset such as commodities or stocks.
* Financial service market: A market that comprises participants such as commercial banks that provide various financial services like ATM. Credit cards. Credit rating, stock broking etc. is known as financial service market. Individuals and firms use financial services markets, to purchase services that enhance the workings of debt and equity markets.
* Depository markets: A depository market consists of depository institutions (such as banks) that accept deposits from individuals and firms and uses these funds to participate in the debt market, by giving loans or purchasing other debt instruments such as treasury bills.
* Non-depository market: Non-depository market carry out various functions in financial markets ranging from financial intermediary to selling, insurance etc. The various constituencies in non-depositary markets are mutual funds, insurance companies, pension funds, brokerage firms etc.
*Relation between Bonds and Commodity Prices: With the increase in commodity prices, the cost of goods for companies increases. This increase in commodity prices level causes a rise in inflation.
*Relation between Commodities and Equities: Due to the production cost remaining same, and revenues rising (due to high commodity prices), the operating profit (revenue minus cost) increases, which in turn drives up equity prices.

<text>Compact Disc Digital Audio (CDDA or CD-DA), also known as Digital Audio Compact Disc or simply as Audio CD, is the standard format for audio compact discs. The standard is defined in the &quot;Red Book&quot; technical specifications, which is why the format is also dubbed &quot;Redbook audio&quot; in some contexts. CDDA utilizes pulse-code modulation (PCM) and uses a 44,100 Hz sampling frequency and 16-bit resolution, and was originally specified to store up to 74 minutes of stereo audio per disc.

The first commercially available audio CD player, the Sony CDP-101, was released in October 1982 in Japan. The format gained worldwide acceptance in 1983–84, selling more than a million CD players in its first two years, to play 22.5 million discs, before overtaking records and cassette tapes to become the dominant standard for commercial music. Peaking around year 2000, the audio CD contracted over the next decade due to rising popularity and revenue from digital downloading, and during the 2010s by digital music streaming, but has remained as one of the primary distribution methods for the music industry. In the United States, phonograph record revenues surpassed the CD in 2020 for the first time since the 1980s, but in other major markets like Japan it remains the premier music format by a distance and in Germany it outsold other physical formats at least fourfold in 2022.

In the music industry, audio CDs have been generally sold as either a CD single (now largely dormant), or as full-length albums, the latter of which has been more commonplace since the 2000s. The format has also been influential in the progression of video game music, used in mixed mode CD-ROMs, providing CD-quality audio popularized during the 1990s on hardware such as PlayStation, Sega Saturn and personal computers with 16-bit sound cards like the Sound Blaster 16.

== History ==
The optophone, first presented in 1913, was an early device that used light for both recording and playback of sound signals on a transparent photograph. More than thirty years later, American inventor James T. Russell has been credited with inventing the first system to record digital media on a photosensitive plate. Russell&#x27;s patent application was filed in 1966, and he was granted a patent in 1970. Following litigation, Sony and Philips licensed Russell&#x27;s patents for recording in 1988. It is debatable whether Russell&#x27;s concepts, patents, and prototypes instigated and in some measure influenced the compact disc&#x27;s design.

The compact disc is an evolution of LaserDisc technology, where a focused laser beam is used that enables the high information density required for high-quality digital audio signals. Unlike the prior art by Optophonie and James Russell, the information on the disc is read from a reflective layer using a laser as a light source through a protective substrate. Prototypes were developed by Philips and Sony independently in the late 1970s. Although originally dismissed by Philips Research management as a trivial pursuit, the CD became the primary focus for Philips as the LaserDisc format struggled. 

In 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. After a year of experimentation and discussion, the &quot;Red Book&quot; CD-DA standard was published in 1980. After their commercial release in 1982, compact discs and their players were extremely popular. Despite costing up to $1,000, over 400,000 CD players were sold in the United States between 1983 and 1984. By 1988, CD sales in the United States surpassed those of vinyl LPs, and, by 1992, CD sales surpassed those of prerecorded music-cassette tapes. The success of the compact disc has been credited to the cooperation between Philips and Sony, which together agreed upon and developed compatible hardware. The unified design of the compact disc allowed consumers to purchase any disc or player from any company and allowed the CD to dominate the at-home music market unchallenged.

=== Digital audio laser-disc prototypes ===
In 1974, Lou Ottens, director of the audio division of Philips, started a small group to develop an analog optical audio disc with a diameter of and a sound quality superior to that of the vinyl record. However, due to the unsatisfactory performance of the analog format, two Philips research engineers recommended a digital format in March 1974. In 1977, Philips then established a laboratory with the mission of creating a digital audio disc. The diameter of Philips&#x27;s prototype compact disc was set at , the diagonal of an audio cassette.

Heitaro Nakajima, who developed an early digital audio recorder within Japan&#x27;s national public broadcasting organization, NHK, in 1970, became general manager of Sony&#x27;s audio department in 1971. In 1973, his team developed a digital PCM adaptor that made audio recordings using a Betamax video recorder. After this, in 1974 the leap to storing digital audio on an optical disc was easily made. Sony first publicly demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in September 1976. A year later, in September 1977, Sony showed the press a disc that could play an hour of digital audio (44,100 Hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution) using modified frequency modulation encoding. 

In September 1978, Sony demonstrated an optical digital audio disc with a 150-minute playing time, 44,056 Hz sampling rate, 16-bit linear resolution, and cross-interleaved Reed-Solomon coding (CIRC) error correction code—specifications similar to those later settled upon for the standard compact disc format in 1980. Technical details of Sony&#x27;s digital audio disc were presented during the 62nd AES Convention, held on 13–16 March 1979, in Brussels. Sony&#x27;s AES technical paper was published on 1 March 1979. A week later, on 8 March, Philips publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio disc at a press conference called &quot;Philips Introduce Compact Disc&quot; in Eindhoven, Netherlands. Sony executive Norio Ohga, later CEO and chairman of Sony, and Heitaro Nakajima were convinced of the format&#x27;s commercial potential and pushed further development despite widespread skepticism.

=== Collaboration and standardization ===

In 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. Led by engineers Kees Schouhamer Immink and Toshitada Doi, the research pushed forward laser and optical disc technology. After a year of experimentation and discussion, the task force produced the &quot;Red Book&quot; CD-DA standard. First published in 1980, the standard was formally adopted by the IEC as an international standard in 1987, with various amendments becoming part of the standard in 1996.

Philips coined the term &quot;compact disc&quot; in line with another audio product, the Compact Cassette, and contributed the general manufacturing process, based on video LaserDisc technology. Philips also contributed eight-to-fourteen modulation (EFM), while Sony contributed the error-correction method, CIRC, which offers resilience to defects such as scratches and fingerprints.

&quot;The Compact Disc Story&quot;, told by a former member of the task force, gives background information on the many technical decisions made, including the choice of the sampling frequency, playing time, and disc diameter. The task force consisted of around 6 persons, though according to Philips, the compact disc was &quot;invented collectively by a large group of people working as a team&quot;.

=== Initial launch and adoption ===
Early milestones in the launch and adoption of the format included:
* The first &quot;test pressing&quot; was of a recording of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;An Alpine Symphony&quot;, recorded December 1–3, 1980 and played by the Berlin Philharmonic and conducted by Herbert von Karajan, who had been enlisted as an ambassador for the format in 1979.
* The world presentation took place during the Salzburg Easter Festival on 15 April 1981, at a press conference of Akio Morita and Norio Ohga (Sony), Joop van Tilburg (Philips), and Richard Busch (PolyGram), in the presence of Karajan who praised the new format.
* The first &quot;public demonstration&quot; was on the BBC television programme &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; in 1981, when the Bee Gees&#x27; album &quot;Living Eyes&quot; (1981) was played.
* The first &quot;commercial&quot; compact disc was produced on 17 August 1982, a 1979 recording of Chopin waltzes performed by Claudio Arrau.
* The first 50 titles were &quot;released&quot; in Japan on 1 October 1982, the first of which was a re-release of the Billy Joel album &quot;52nd Street&quot;.
* The first CD played on BBC Radio was in October 1982.
*The Japanese launch was followed on 14 March 1983 by the introduction of CD players and discs to Europe and North America where CBS Records released sixteen titles.

The first artist to sell a million copies on CD was Dire Straits, with their 1985 album &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;. One of the first CD markets was devoted to reissuing popular music whose commercial potential was already proven. The first major artist to have their entire catalog converted to CD was David Bowie, whose first fourteen studio albums (up to Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)) of (then) sixteen were made available by RCA Records in February 1985, along with four greatest hits albums; his fifteenth and sixteenth albums (Let&#x27;s Dance and Tonight, respectively) had already been issued on CD by EMI Records in 1983 and 1984, respectively. On 26 February 1987, the first four UK albums by the Beatles were released in mono on compact disc.

The growing acceptance of the CD in 1983 marks the beginning of the popular digital audio revolution. It was enthusiastically received, especially in the early-adopting classical music and audiophile communities, and its handling quality received particular praise. As the price of players gradually came down, and with the introduction of the portable Discman, the CD began to gain popularity in the larger popular and rock music markets. With the rise in CD sales, pre-recorded cassette tape sales began to decline in the late 1980s; CD sales overtook cassette sales in the early 1990s. In 1988, 400 million CDs were manufactured by 50 pressing plants around the world.

=== Further development ===
Early CD players employed binary-weighted digital-to-analog converters (DAC), which contained individual electrical components for each bit of the DAC. Even when using high-precision components, this approach was prone to decoding errors. Another issue was jitter, a time-related defect. Confronted with the instability of DACs, manufacturers initially turned to increasing the number of bits in the DAC and using several DACs per audio channel, averaging their output. This increased the cost of CD players but did not solve the core problem.

A breakthrough in the late 1980s culminated in development of the 1-bit DAC, which converts high-resolution low-frequency digital input signal into a lower-resolution high-frequency signal that is mapped to voltages and then smoothed with an analog filter. The temporary use of a lower-resolution signal simplified circuit design and improved efficiency, which is why it became dominant in CD players starting from the early 1990s. Philips used a variation of this technique called pulse-density modulation (PDM), while Matsushita (now Panasonic) chose pulse-width modulation (PWM), advertising it as MASH, which is an acronym derived from their patented Multi-stAge noiSe-sHaping PWM topology.

The CD was primarily planned as the successor to the vinyl record for playing music, rather than as a data storage medium. However, CDs have grown to encompass other applications. In 1983, following the CD&#x27;s introduction, Immink and Joseph Braat presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd AES Convention. In June 1985, the computer-readable CD-ROM (read-only memory) and, in 1990, recordable CD-R discs were introduced. Recordable CDs became an alternative to tape for recording and distributing music and could be duplicated without degradation in sound quality.

Other newer video formats such as DVD and Blu-ray use the same physical geometry as CD, and most DVD and Blu-ray players are backward compatible with audio CDs.

=== Peak ===
CD sales in the United States peaked by 2000. By the early 2000s, the CD player had largely replaced the audio cassette player as standard equipment in new automobiles, with 2010 being the final model year for any car in the United States to have a factory-equipped cassette player.

Two new formats were marketed in the 2000s designed as successors to the CD: the Super Audio CD (SACD) and DVD-Audio. However neither of these were adopted partly due to increased relevance of digital (virtual) music and the apparent lack of audible improvements in audio quality to most human ears. These effectively extended the CD&#x27;s longevity in the music market.

=== Decline ===
With the advent and popularity of Internet-based distribution of files in lossy-compressed audio formats such as MP3, sales of CDs began to decline in the 2000s. For example, between 2000 and 2008, despite overall growth in music sales and one anomalous year of increase, major-label CD sales declined overall by 20%. Despite rapidly declining sales year-over-year, the pervasiveness of the technology lingered for a time, with companies placing CDs in pharmacies, supermarkets, and filling station convenience stores to target buyers less likely to be able to use Internet-based distribution. 

In 2012, CDs and DVDs made up only 34% of music sales in the United States. By 2015, only 24% of music in the United States was purchased on physical media, two thirds of this consisting of CDs; however, in the same year in Japan, over 80% of music was bought on CDs and other physical formats. In 2018, U.S. CD sales were 52 million units—less than 6% of the peak sales volume in 2000. In the UK, 32 million units were sold, almost 100 million fewer than in 2008. In 2018, Best Buy announced plans to decrease their focus on CD sales, however, while continuing to sell records, sales of which are growing during the vinyl revival. 

During the 2010s, the increasing popularity of solid-state media and music streaming services caused automakers to remove automotive CD players in favor of minijack auxiliary inputs, wired connections to USB devices and wireless Bluetooth connections. Automakers viewed CD players as using up valuable space and taking up weight which could be reallocated to more popular features, like large touchscreens. By 2021, only Lexus and General Motors were still including CD players as standard equipment with certain vehicles.

=== Current status ===
CDs continued to be strong in some markets such as Japan where 132 million units were produced in 2019.

The decline in CD sales has slowed in recent years; in 2021, CD sales increased in the US for the first time since 2004, with Axios citing its rise to &quot;young people who are finding they like hard copies of music in the digital age&quot;. It came at the same time as both vinyl and cassette reached sales levels not seen in 30 years. The RIAA reported that CD revenue made a dip in 2022, before increasing again in 2023 and overtook downloading for the first time in over a decade.

In the US, 33.4 million CD albums were sold in the year 2022. In France in 2023, 10.5 million CDs were sold, almost double that of vinyl, but both of them represented generated 12% each of the French music industry revenues.

=== Awards and accolades ===
Sony and Philips received praise for the development of the compact disc from professional organizations. These awards include:
* Technical Grammy Award for Sony and Philips, 1998.
* IEEE Milestone award, 2009, for Philips alone with the citation: &quot;On 8 March 1979, N.V. Philips&#x27; Gloeilampenfabrieken demonstrated for the international press a Compact Disc Audio Player. The demonstration showed that it is possible by using digital optical recording and playback to reproduce audio signals with superb stereo quality. This research at Philips established the technical standard for digital optical recording systems.&quot;

== Standard ==
The &quot;Red Book&quot; specifies the physical parameters and properties of the CD, the optical parameters, deviations and error rate, modulation system (eight-to-fourteen modulation, EFM) and error correction facility (CIRC), and the eight subcode channels. These parameters are common to all compact discs and used by all logical formats: audio CD, CD-ROM, etc. The standard also specifies the form of digital audio encoding.

The first edition of the &quot;Red Book&quot; was released in 1980 by Philips and Sony; it was adopted by the Digital Audio Disc Committee and ratified by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Technical Committee 100 as an international standard in 1987 with the reference IEC 60908. The second edition of IEC 60908 was published in 1999 and it replaces the first edition, amendment 1 (1992) and the corrigendum to amendment 1. The IEC 60908 however does not contain all the information for extensions that is available in the &quot;Red Book&quot;, such as the details for CD-Text, CD+G and CD+EG.

The standard is not freely available and must be licensed. It is available from Philips and the IEC. , Philips outsources licensing of the standard to Adminius, which charges for the &quot;Red Book&quot;, plus each for the &quot;Subcode Channels R-W&quot; and &quot;CD Text Mode&quot; annexes.

== Audio format ==
The audio contained in a CD-DA consists of two-channel signed 16-bit LPCM sampled at 44,100 Hz and written as a little-endian interleaved stream with left channel coming first.

The sampling rate is adapted from that attained when recording digital audio on videotape with a PCM adaptor, an earlier way of storing digital audio. An audio CD can represent frequencies up to 22.05 kHz, the Nyquist frequency of the 44.1 kHz sample rate.

There was a long debate over the use of 16-bit (Sony) or 14-bit (Philips) quantization, and 44,056 or 44,100 samples/s (Sony) or approximately 44,000 samples/s (Philips). When the Sony/Philips task force designed the Compact Disc, Philips had already developed a 14-bit D/A converter (DAC), but Sony insisted on 16-bit. In the end Sony won, so 16 bits and 44.1 kilosamples per second prevailed. Philips found a way to produce 16-bit quality using its 14-bit DAC by using four times oversampling.

Some early CDs were mastered with pre-emphasis, an artificial boost of high audio frequencies. The pre-emphasis improves the apparent signal-to-noise ratio by making better use of the channel&#x27;s dynamic range. On playback, the player applies a de-emphasis filter to restore the frequency response curve to an overall flat one. Pre-emphasis time constants are 50 μs and 15 μs (9.49 dB boost at 20 kHz), and a binary flag in the disc subcode instructs the player to apply de-emphasis filtering if appropriate. Playback of such discs in a computer or ripping to WAV files typically does not take into account the pre-emphasis, so such files play back with an incorrect frequency response. FFmpeg has a filter to remove (or apply) the pre-emphasis in order to create standard WAV files, or to create CDs with pre-emphasis.

Four-channel, or quadraphonic, support was originally intended to be included in CD-DA. The &quot;Red Book&quot; specification briefly mentioned a four-channel mode in its June 1980, September 1983, and November 1991 editions. On the first page, it lays out the &quot;Main parameters&quot; of the CD system, including: &quot;Number of channels: 2 and/or 4 simultaneously[*] sampled.&quot; The footnote says, &quot;In the case of more than two channels the encoder and decoder diagrams have to be adapted.&quot;

In reality, however, the underspecified &quot;four-channel&quot; mode was dropped from the CD standard when it was adopted by the International Electrotechnical Commission and became IEC 908:1987, and later IEC 60908:1999. Since the behavior of the &quot;four-channel&quot; or &quot;Broadcasting use&quot; bit was never specified by either CD standard, no mass-marketed discs have attempted to use the Red Book&#x27;s four-channel mode, and no players have purported to implement it.

== Storage capacity and playing time ==
The creators of the CD originally aimed at a playing time of 60 minutes with a disc diameter of 100 mm (Sony) or 115 mm (Philips). Sony vice-president Norio Ohga suggested extending the capacity to 74 minutes and 33 seconds to accommodate the recording of Wilhelm Furtwängler conducting Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony at the 1951 Bayreuth Festival. The additional 14-minute playing time required increasing disc diameter. Kees Schouhamer Immink, Philips&#x27; chief engineer, however, denies this, claiming that the increase was motivated by technical considerations and that even after the increase in size, the Furtwängler recording would not have fit onto one of the earliest CDs.

According to a &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; interview, the story is slightly more involved. In 1979, Philips owned PolyGram, one of the world&#x27;s largest music distributors. PolyGram had set up a large experimental CD plant in Hannover, Germany, which could produce huge numbers of CDs having a diameter of 115 mm. Sony did not yet have such a facility. If Sony had agreed on the 115-mm disc, Philips would have had a significant competitive edge in the market. The long playing time of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony imposed by Ohga was used to push Philips to accept 120 mm, so that Philips&#x27; PolyGram lost its edge on disc fabrication.

The 74:33 playing time of a CD, which is longer than the 22 minutes per side typical of long-playing (LP) vinyl albums, was often used to the CD&#x27;s advantage during the early years when CDs and LPs vied for commercial sales. CDs would often be released with one or more bonus tracks, enticing consumers to buy the CD for the extra material. However, attempts to combine double LPs onto one CD occasionally resulted in the opposite situation in which the CD would instead offer less audio than the LP. One such example was with DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince&#x27;s double album &quot;He&#x27;s the DJ, I&#x27;m the Rapper&quot;, in which initial CD releases of the album had multiple tracks edited down for length to fit on a single disc; recent CD reissues package the album across two discs as a result. Furthermore, early CD releases were restricted by the 72-minute limit of 3/4 inch U-matic tapes used by early PCM adaptors; by 1988, higher-capacity alternatives would arrive on the market, allowing for releases to make use of the full 74:33. This and the emergence of 80-minute CDs allowed for some double albums that were previously edited for length, e.g. &quot;1999&quot; by Prince, or packaged as double CDs, e.g. &quot;Tommy&quot; by the Who, to be re-released on a single disc.

Playing times beyond 74:33 are achieved by decreasing track pitch (the distance separating the track as it spirals the disc). However, most players can still accommodate the more closely spaced data if it is still within &quot;Red Book&quot; tolerances. Manufacturing processes used in the final years of CD technology allowed an audio CD to contain up to 82 minutes (variable from one replication plant to another) without requiring the content creator to sign a waiver releasing the plant owner from responsibility if the CD produced is marginally or entirely unreadable by some playback equipment. In this final practice, maximum CD playing time crept higher by reducing minimum engineering tolerances.

== Technical specifications ==

=== Data encoding ===
Each audio sample is a signed 16-bit two&#x27;s complement integer, which has sample values ranging from −32768 to +32767. The source audio data is divided into frames, containing twelve samples each (six left and six right samples, alternating), for a total of 192 bits (24 bytes) of audio data per frame.

This stream of audio frames is then subjected to CIRC encoding, which segments and rearranges the data and expands it with error correction codes in a way that allows occasional read errors to be detected and corrected. CIRC encoding interleaves the audio frames throughout the disc over several consecutive frames so that the information will be more resistant to burst errors. Therefore, a physical frame on the disc will actually contain information from multiple logical audio frames. This process adds 64 bits of error correction codes to each frame. After this, 8 bits of subcode data are added to each of these encoded frames, which is used for control and addressing when playing the CD.

CIRC encoding plus the subcode byte generates 33-byte long frames, called &quot;channel-data&quot; frames. These frames are then modulated through eight-to-fourteen modulation (EFM), where each 8-bit byte is replaced with a corresponding 14-bit word designed to reduce the number of transitions between 0 and 1. This reduces the density of physical pits on the disc and provides an additional degree of error tolerance. Three &quot;merging&quot; bits are added before each 14-bit word for disambiguation and synchronization. In total, there are 33 × (14 + 3) = 561 bits. A 27-bit word (a 24-bit pattern plus 3 merging bits) is added to the beginning of each frame to assist with synchronization, so the reading device can locate frames easily. With this, a frame ends up containing 588 bits of &quot;channel data&quot; which are decoded to 192 bits of digital audio.

The frames of channel data are finally written to disc physically in the form of pits and lands, with each pit or land representing a series of zeroes, and with the transition points—the edge of each pit—representing a 1. A &quot;Red Book&quot;-compatible CD-R has pit-and-land-shaped spots on a layer of organic dye instead of actual pits and lands; a laser creates the spots by altering the reflective properties of the dye.

Due to the weaker error correction sector structure used on audio CDs and video CDs (&quot;Mode 2 Form 2&quot;) than on data discs (&quot;Mode 1&quot; or &quot;Mode 2 Form 1&quot;), C2 errors are not correctable and signify data loss. Even with uncorrectable errors, a compact disc player uses error concealment with the aim of making the damage unhearable.

=== Data structure ===
The audio data stream in an audio CD is continuous but has three parts. The main portion, further divided into playable audio tracks, is the &quot;program area&quot;. This section is preceded by a &quot;lead-in&quot; track and followed by a &quot;lead-out&quot; track. The lead-in and lead-out tracks encode only silent audio, but all three sections contain subcode data streams.

The lead-in&#x27;s subcode contains repeated copies of the disc&#x27;s table of contents (TOC), which provides an index of the start positions of the tracks in the program area and of the lead-out. The track positions are referenced by absolute timecode, relative to the start of the program area, in MSF format: minutes, seconds, and fractional seconds called &quot;frames&quot;. Each timecode frame is one seventy-fifth of a second, and corresponds to a block of 98 channel-data frames—ultimately, a block of 588 pairs of left and right audio samples. Timecode contained in the subchannel data allows the reading device to locate the region of the disc that corresponds to the timecode in the TOC. The TOC on discs is analogous to the partition table on hard drives. Nonstandard or corrupted TOC records are abused as a form of CD/DVD copy protection, in e.g. the key2Audio scheme.

==== Tracks ====

The largest entity on a CD is called a track. A CD can contain up to 99 tracks (including a data track for mixed mode discs). Each track can in turn have up to 100 indexes, though players that still support this feature have become rarer over time. The vast majority of songs are recorded under index 1, with the pregap being index 0. Sometimes hidden tracks are placed at the end of the last track of the disc, often using index 2 or 3, or using the pregap as index 0 (this latter usage will result in the track playing as the time counter counts down to time 0:00 at the start of the track, index 1.) This is also the case with some discs offering &quot;101 sound effects&quot;, with 100 and 101 being indexed as two and three on track 99. The index, if used, is occasionally put on the track listing as a decimal part of the track number, such as 99.2 or 99.3. The track and index structure of the CD were carried forward to the DVD format as title and chapter, respectively.

Tracks, in turn, are divided into timecode frames (or sectors), which are further subdivided into channel-data frames.

==== Frames and timecode frames ====

The smallest entity in a CD is a channel-data &quot;frame&quot;, which consists of 33 bytes and contains six complete 16-bit stereo samples: 24 bytes for the audio (two bytes × two channels × six samples = 24 bytes), eight CIRC error-correction bytes, and one subcode byte. As described in , after the EFM modulation the number of bits in a frame totals 588.

On a &quot;Red Book&quot; audio CD, data is addressed using the &quot;MSF scheme&quot;, with timecodes expressed in minutes, seconds and another type of &quot;frames&quot; (mm:ss:ff), where one frame corresponds to 1/75 of a second of audio: 588 pairs of left and right samples. This timecode frame is distinct from the 33-byte channel-data frame described above, and is used for time display and positioning the reading laser. When editing and extracting CD audio, this timecode frame is the smallest addressable time interval for an audio CD; thus, track boundaries only occur on these frame boundaries. Each of these structures contains 98 channel-data frames, totaling 98 × 24 = 2,352 bytes of music. The CD is played at a speed of 75 frames (or sectors) per second, thus 44,100 samples or 176,400 bytes per second.

In the 1990s, CD-ROM and related Digital Audio Extraction (DAE) technology introduced the term &quot;sector&quot; to refer to each timecode frame, with each sector being identified by a sequential integer number starting at zero, and with tracks aligned on sector boundaries. An audio CD sector corresponds to 2,352 bytes of decoded data. The &quot;Red Book&quot; does not refer to sectors, nor does it distinguish the corresponding sections of the disc&#x27;s data stream except as &quot;frames&quot; in the MSF addressing scheme.

The following table shows the relation between tracks, timecode frames (sectors) and channel-data frames:

=== Bit rate ===
The audio bit rate for a &quot;Red Book&quot; audio CD is 1,411,200 bits per second (1,411 kbit/s) or 176,400 bytes per second; 2 channels × 44,100 samples per second per channel × 16 bits per sample. Audio data coming in from a CD is contained in sectors, each sector being 2,352 bytes, and with 75 sectors containing 1 second of audio. For comparison, the bit rate of a &quot;1×&quot; CD-ROM is defined as 2,048 bytes per sector × 75 sectors per second = 153,600 bytes per second. The remaining 304 bytes in a sector are used for additional data error correction.

=== Data access from computers ===
Unlike on a DVD or CD-ROM, there are no &quot;files&quot; on a &quot;Red Book&quot; audio CD; there is only one continuous stream of LPCM audio data, and a parallel, smaller set of 8 subcode data streams. Computer operating systems, however, may provide access to an audio CD as if it contains files. For example, Windows represents the CD&#x27;s Table of Contents as a set of Compact Disc Audio track (CDA) files, each file containing indexing information, not audio data. By contrast however, Finder on macOS presents the CD&#x27;s content as an actual set of files, with the AIFF-extension, which can be copied directly, randomly and individually by track as if it were actual files. In reality, macOS performs its own as-needed-rips in the background completely transparent to the user. The copied tracks are fully playable and editable on the user&#x27;s computer.

In a process called ripping, digital audio extraction software can be used to read CD-DA audio data and store it in files. Common audio file formats for this purpose include WAV and AIFF, which simply preface the LPCM data with a short header; FLAC, ALAC, and Windows Media Audio Lossless, which compress the LPCM data in ways that conserve space yet allow it to be restored without any changes; and various lossy, perceptual coding formats like MP3, AAC, and Opus, which modify and compress the audio data in ways that irreversibly change the audio, but that exploit features of human hearing to make the changes difficult to discern.

== Format variations ==
Recording publishers have created CDs that violate the &quot;Red Book&quot; standard. Some do so for the purpose of copy prevention, using systems like Copy Control. Some do so for extra features such as DualDisc, which includes both a CD layer and a DVD layer whereby the CD layer is much thinner, 0.9 mm, than required by the &quot;Red Book&quot;, which stipulates a nominal 1.2 mm, but at least 1.1 mm. Philips and many other companies have stated that including the Compact Disc Digital Audio logo on such non-conforming discs may constitute trademark infringement.

Super Audio CD was a standard published in 1999 that aimed to provide better audio quality than CDs. DVD-Audio emerged at around the same time. Both formats were designed to feature audio of higher fidelity by using a higher sampling rate and DVD media. Neither format was widely accepted.

== Copyright issues ==
There have been moves by the recording industry to make audio CDs (Compact Disc Digital Audio) unplayable on computer CD-ROM drives, to prevent the copying of music. This is done by intentionally introducing errors onto the disc that the embedded circuits on most stand-alone audio players can automatically compensate for, but which may confuse CD-ROM drives. Consumer rights advocates as of October 2001 pushed to require warning labels on compact discs that do not conform to the official Compact Disc Digital Audio standard (often called the &quot;Red Book&quot;) to inform consumers which discs do not permit full fair use of their content.

In 2005, Sony BMG Music Entertainment was criticized when a copy protection mechanism known as Extended Copy Protection (XCP) used on some of their audio CDs automatically and surreptitiously installed copy-prevention software on computers (see Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal). Such discs are not legally allowed to be called CDs or Compact Discs because they break the &quot;Red Book&quot; standard governing CDs, and Amazon.com for example describes them as &quot;copy protected discs&quot; rather than &quot;compact discs&quot; or &quot;CDs&quot;.

<text>The major system (also called the phonetic number system, phonetic mnemonic system, or Hérigone&#x27;s mnemonic system) is a mnemonic technique used to help in memorizing numbers.

The system works by converting numbers into consonants, then into words by adding vowels. The system works on the principle that images can be remembered more easily than numbers.

One notable explanation of this system was given in Martin Gardner&#x27;s book &quot;The First Scientific American Book of Mathematical Puzzles and Diversions&quot; (just &quot;Mathematical Puzzles and Diversions&quot; in the UK edition), which has since been republished in &quot;The New Martin Gardner Mathematical Library&quot; as &quot;Hexaflexagons, Probability Paradoxes, and the Tower of Hanoi&quot;. In this, Gardner traces the history of the system back to similar systems of Pierre Hérigone and Richard Grey with uses by Lewis Carroll and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.

==The system==
Each numeral is associated with one or more consonants. The link is to the sound, not the letter. (For example, the letters C in &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;Cynthia&quot;, and &quot;cello&quot; each have different values in the system – 7, 0, and 6, respectively.) Vowels, semivowels and the consonant /h/ are ignored. These can be used as &quot;fillers&quot; to make sensible words from the resulting consonant sequences. A standard mapping is:

The groups of similar sounds and the rules for applying the mappings are almost always fixed, but other hooks and mappings can be used as long as the person using the system can remember them and apply them consistently.

Each numeral maps to a set of similar sounds with similar mouth and tongue positions. The link is phonetic, that is to say, it is the consonant sounds that matter, not the spelling. Therefore, a word like &quot;action&quot; would encode the number &quot;762&quot; (/k/-/ʃ/-/n/), not &quot;712&quot; (&quot;k&quot;-&quot;t&quot;-&quot;n&quot;). Double letters are disregarded when not pronounced separately, e.g. &quot;muddy&quot; encodes &quot;31&quot; (/m/-/d/), not &quot;311&quot;, but &quot;midday&quot; encodes &quot;311&quot; (/m/-/d/-/d/) while &quot;accept&quot; encodes &quot;7091&quot; (/k/-/s/-/p/-/t/) since the &quot;d&quot;s and &quot;c&quot;s are pronounced separately. &quot;x&quot; encodes &quot;70&quot; when pronounced as /ks/ or /gz/ (e.g. in &quot;fax&quot; and &quot;exam&quot;) and &quot;76&quot; when pronounced /kʃ/ or /gʒ/ (e.g. in &quot;anxious&quot; or &quot;luxury&quot;); &quot;z&quot; encodes &quot;10&quot; when pronounced /ts/ (e.g. in &quot;pizza&quot;). In &quot;ghost&quot; (&quot;701&quot;, /ɡ/-/s/-/t/) and &quot;enough&quot; (&quot;28&quot;, /n/-/f/), &quot;gh&quot; is being encoded by different numerals. Usually, a rhotic accent is assumed, e.g. &quot;fear&quot; would encode &quot;84&quot; (/f/-/r/) rather than &quot;8&quot; (/f/).

Often the mapping is compact. &quot;Hindquarters&quot;, for example, translates unambiguously to &quot;2174140&quot; (/n/-/d/-/k/-/r/-/t/-/r/-/z/), which amounts to a twelve-letter word encoded by seven digits in seven letters, and can be easily visualized.

Each numeral maps to a set of similar sounds with similar mouth and tongue positions.
For most people it would be easier to remember &quot;3.1415927&quot; (an approximation of the mathematical constant pi) as:
: &quot;meteor&quot; (&quot;314&quot;, /m/-/t/-/r/)
: &quot;tail&quot; (&quot;15&quot;, /t/-/l/)
: &quot;pink&quot; (&quot;927&quot;, /p/-/ŋ/-/k/, and taking /ŋ/ to be &quot;2&quot;)

Short term visual memory of imagined scenes allows large numbers of digits to be memorized with ease. Longer-term memory may require the formulation of more object-related mnemonics with greater logical connection, perhaps forming grammatical sentences that apply to the matter rather than just strings of images.

The system can be employed with phone numbers. One would typically make up multiple words, preferably a sentence, or an ordered sequence of images featuring the owner of the number.

The Major System can be combined with a peg system for remembering lists, and is sometimes used also as a method of generating the pegs. It can also be combined with other memory techniques such as rhyming, substitute words, or the method of loci. Repetition and concentration using the ordinary memory is still required.

It is possible to use a computer to automatically translate the number into a set of words. One can then pick the best of several alternatives. Such programs include &quot;Numzi&quot; &quot;Rememberg&quot; &quot;Fonbee&quot;, the freeware &quot;2Know&quot;, and the website &quot;pinfruit&quot;.

==History==


A different memory system, the method of loci, was taught to schoolchildren for centuries, at least until 1584, &quot;when Puritan reformers declared it unholy for encouraging bizarre and irreverent images.&quot; The same objection can be made over the major system, with or without the method of loci. Mental images may be easier to remember if they are insulting, violent, or obscene (see Von Restorff effect).

Pierre Hérigone (1580–1643) devised the earliest version of the major system and published it in 1634. The system was further developed by Johann Just Winckelmann (pseudonym Stanislaus Mink von Weunsshein and published in 1648. It was later elaborated upon by other users. In 1730, Richard Grey set forth a complicated system that used both consonants and vowels to represent the digits. In 1808 Gregor von Feinaigle introduced the improvement of representing the digits by consonants (but reversed the values of 8 and 9 compared to those listed above).

In 1825 Aimé Paris published the first known version of the major system in its modern form.

In 1843, Carl Otto Reventlow (1817–1873) published a mnemonics textbook on a method similar to Paris&#x27; and traveled throughout Germany promoting it.

In 1844 Francis Fauvel Gouraud (1808–1847) delivered a series of lectures introducing his mnemonic system which was based on Aimé Paris&#x27; version. The lectures drew some of the largest crowds ever assembled to hear lectures of a &quot;scientific&quot; nature up to that time. This series of lectures was later published as &quot;Phreno-Mnemotechny or The Art of Memory&quot; in 1845 and his system received wide acclaim. According to Gouraud, Richard Grey indicated that a discussion on Hebrew linguistics in William Beveridge&#x27;s &quot;Institutionum chronotogicarum libri duo, una cum totidem arithmetices chronologicæ libellis&quot; (London, 1669) inspired him to create his system of mnemotechniques which later evolved in to the major system.

In the 1880s Marcus Dwight Larrowe, alias Silas Holmes, was teaching memory courses in the United States based on the Major System using a third alias Dr. Antoine Loisette. Because he was charging inordinate sums of money for a system which had obviously existed before, George S. Fellows published &quot;&quot;Loisette&quot; exposed&quot; (1888) and included all the material of Larrowe&#x27;s course which he determined not to be under copyright. The incident was notable enough to gain coverage by way of a book review in the journal &quot;Science&quot;. A well-known student of Loisette&#x27;s included Mark Twain whose endorsement Loisette used regularly to sell his course. Following the revelation that he had not originated the system, Larrowe self-published his material under the pseudonym Dr. Antoine Loisette in 1895 and 1896 and it was later re-published by Funk &amp; Wagnalls in 1899.

In the late 1800s Christof Ludwig Poehlmann (aka Christopher Louis Pelman), a German who had emigrated to the United States, and William Joseph Ennever created and ran a series of booklets and memory courses using the system which resulted in The Pelman Schools, The Pelman Institute, and were generally known as Pelmanism.

Poehlmann eventually moved back to Germany around 1910 where he continued offering his memory courses and training apparently with a focus on language learning. indicated that he studied under him for a year in 1911. Fürst later practiced criminal law in Frankfort in pre-Hitler Germany before fleeing, as a Jew, to Prague where he taught at Masaryk University until emigrating to New York in 1939. In 1939, Fürst published &quot;Use your Head&quot; followed by &quot;How to Remember&quot; (1944), which was later reprinted as &quot;The Practical Way to Better Memory&quot;, and followed up with a series of 12 booklets entitled &quot;You Can Remember! A Home Study Course in Memory and Concentration&quot; (1946) which all extolled the system, which he called the &quot;Basic List&quot; and the &quot;Number System&quot; along with other mnemonic systems. In a 1946 profile in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Bruno indicates that German scholar Conradus Celtes originated the system.

The system described in this article would be re-popularized after 1957 and through the 1980s in several books by Harry Lorayne, a magician and best selling contemporary author on memory. The most popular of the titles featuring the system is &quot;The Memory Book: The Classic Guide to Improving Your Memory at Work, at School, and at Play&quot; (1974, with Jerry Lucas).

This phonetic system had another resurgence in the 1990s thanks to the late night infomercials of Kevin Trudeau who sold a series of tapes called Mega Memory. He also published a similar book &quot;Kevin Trudeau&#x27;s Mega Memory&quot; which used this same system with some slight modifications.
The name &quot;Major System&quot; may refer to Major Bartlomiej Beniowski, who published a version of the system in his book, &quot;The Anti-Absurd or Phrenotypic English Pronouncing and Orthographical Dictionary&quot; in 1845.

There is a reasonable historical possibility that the roots of the Major System are entangled with older systems of shorthand. It is certainly the case that the underlying structure of the Major System has a direct overlap with Gregg shorthand, which was a popular shorthand system in the late 1800s and early 1900s.

Phonetic number memorization systems also occur in other parts of the world, such as the Katapayadi system going back to at least the 7th Century in India.

==Practice==
Memory feats centered around numbers can be performed by experts who have learned a &#x27;vocabulary&#x27; of at least one image for each 1 and 2-digit number, as these can then be combined to form narratives. Learning a vocabulary of 3-digit numbers is harder, because ten times more images need to be learned for each extra digit. Many mnemonists, however, can use a set of over 1000 images.

The combination of images into a narrative is easier to do rapidly than forming a coherent grammatical sentence. This pre-memorisation and practice at forming images reduces the time required to think up a good imaginary object while creating a strong memorable impression of it. The best words for this purpose are usually nouns, especially those for distinctive objects such as those which make strong impressions on a variety of senses (e.g. &quot;Lime&quot; for 53, as its taste, smell, colour, and even texture are distinctive) or which move (e.g. &quot;arrow&quot; for 4). For basic proficiency, a large vocabulary of image words is not really necessary, since when the table above is reliably learned, it is easy to form your own words ad hoc.

==Indexing sequences==
Mnemonics often center around learning a complete sequence where all objects in that sequence that come before the one you are trying to recall must be recalled first. For instance, using the mnemonic &quot;Richard of York gave battle in vain&quot; to learn the colours of the rainbow; (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet) to remember what colour comes after indigo, one would have to recall the whole sequence. For a short sequence this may be trivial; for longer lists, it can become complicated and error-prone.

A good example would be in recalling the 53rd element of the periodic table. It might be possible for some people to construct and then learn a string of 53 or more items which you have substituted for the elements and then to recall them one by one, counting them off as you go, but it would be a great deal easier and less laborious/tedious to directly associate element 53 with, for example, a lime (a suitable mnemonic for 53) recalling some prior imagining of yours regarding a mishap where lime juice gets into one&#x27;s eye - &quot;eye&quot; sounding like &quot;I&quot;, the symbol for &quot;Iodine&quot;. This allows for random access directly to the item, without the need for recalling any previous items.

If you were remembering element 54 in the process of recalling the periodic table you could then recall an image for 54, for instance thinking of a friend called &quot;Laura&quot; (54) in the lotus position looking very Zen-like in order to remind yourself that element 54 is &quot;Xenon&quot;.

This is an example of combining the Major System with the peg system.

<doc id="41926" wikidata="Q1374523" url="?curid=41926" title="Nearest neighbour algorithm">
<text>The nearest neighbour algorithm was one of the first algorithms used to solve the travelling salesman problem approximately. In that problem, the salesman starts at a random city and repeatedly visits the nearest city until all have been visited. The algorithm quickly yields a short tour, but usually not the optimal one.

==Algorithm ==

These are the steps of the algorithm:
# Initialize all vertices as unvisited.
# Select an arbitrary vertex, set it as the current vertex u. Mark u as visited.
# Find out the shortest edge connecting the current vertex u and an unvisited vertex v.
# Set v as the current vertex u. Mark v as visited.
# If all the vertices in the domain are visited, then terminate. Else, go to step 3.

The sequence of the visited vertices is the output of the algorithm.

The nearest neighbour algorithm is easy to implement and executes quickly, but it can sometimes miss shorter routes which are easily noticed with human insight, due to its &quot;greedy&quot; nature. As a general guide, if the last few stages of the tour are comparable in length to the first stages, then the tour is reasonable; if they are much greater, then it is likely that much better tours exist. Another check is to use an algorithm such as the lower bound algorithm to estimate if this tour is good enough.

In the worst case, the algorithm results in a tour that is much longer than the optimal tour. To be precise, for every constant r there is an instance of the traveling salesman problem such that the length of the tour computed by the nearest neighbour algorithm is greater than r times the length of the optimal tour. Moreover, for each number of cities there is an assignment of distances between the cities for which the nearest neighbour heuristic produces the unique worst possible tour. (If the algorithm is applied on every vertex as the starting vertex, the best path found will be better than at least N/2-1 other tours, where N is the number of vertices.)

The nearest neighbour algorithm may not find a feasible tour at all, even when one exists.

<text>A signal generator is one of a class of electronic devices that generates electrical signals with set properties of amplitude, frequency, and wave shape. These generated signals are used as a stimulus for electronic measurements, typically used in designing, testing, troubleshooting, and repairing electronic or electroacoustic devices, though it often has artistic uses as well. 

There are many different types of signal generators with different purposes and applications and at varying levels of expense. These types include function generators, RF and microwave signal generators, pitch generators, arbitrary waveform generators, digital pattern generators, and frequency generators. In general, no device is suitable for all possible applications.

A signal generator may be as simple as an oscillator with calibrated frequency and amplitude. More general-purpose signal generators allow control of all the characteristics of a signal. Modern general-purpose signal generators will have a microprocessor control and may also permit control from a personal computer. Signal generators may be free-standing self-contained instruments, or may be incorporated into more complex automatic test systems.

==History==
In June 1928, the General Radio 403 was the first commercial signal generator ever marketed. It supported a frequency range of 500 Hz to 1.5 MHz. Also, in April 1929, the first commercial frequency standard was marketed by General Radio with a frequency of 50 KHz.

== General-purpose signal generators ==

=== Function generator ===

A function generator is a device which produces simple repetitive waveforms. Such devices contain an electronic oscillator, a circuit that is capable of creating a repetitive waveform. (Modern devices may use digital signal processing to synthesize waveforms, followed by a digital-to-analog converter, or DAC, to produce an analog output.) The most common waveform is a sine wave, but sawtooth, step (pulse), square, and triangular waveform oscillators are commonly available as are arbitrary waveform generators (AWGs). If the oscillator operates above the human hearing range (&gt;20 kHz), the generator will often include some sort of modulation function such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), or phase modulation (PM) as well as a second oscillator that provides an audio frequency modulation waveform.

=== Arbitrary waveform generator ===
An arbitrary waveform generator (AWG or ARB) is a sophisticated signal generator that generates arbitrary waveforms within published limits of frequency range, accuracy, and output level. Unlike a function generator that produces a small set of specific waveforms, an AWG allows the user to specify a source waveform in a variety of different ways. An AWG is generally more expensive than a function generator and often has less bandwidth. An AWG is used in higher-end design and test applications.

=== RF and microwave signal generators ===
RF (radio frequency) and microwave signal generators are used for testing components, receivers and test systems in a wide variety of applications including cellular communications, WiFi, WiMAX, GPS, audio and video broadcasting, satellite communications, radar and electronic warfare. RF and microwave signal generators normally have similar features and capabilities, but are differentiated by frequency range. RF signal generators typically range from a few kHz to 6 GHz, while microwave signal generators cover a much wider frequency range, from less than 1 MHz to at least 20 GHz. Some models go as high as 70 GHz with a direct coaxial output, and up to hundreds of GHz when used with external waveguide multiplier modules. RF and microwave signal generators can be classified further as analog or vector signal generators.

==== Analog signal generators ====

Analog signal generators based on a sine-wave oscillator were common before the inception of digital electronics, and are still used. There was a sharp distinction in purpose and design of radio-frequency and audio-frequency signal generators.

;RF
RF signal generators produce continuous wave radio frequency signals of defined, adjustable, amplitude and frequency. Many models offer various types of analog modulation, either as standard equipment or as an optional capability to the base unit. This could include AM, FM, ΦM (phase modulation) and pulse modulation. A common feature is an attenuator to vary the signal’s output power. Depending on the manufacturer and model, output powers can range from −135 to +30 dBm. A wide range of output power is desirable, since different applications require different amounts of signal power. For example, if a signal has to travel through a very long cable out to an antenna, a high output signal may be needed to overcome the losses through the cable and still have sufficient power at the antenna. But when testing receiver sensitivity, a low signal level is required to see how the receiver behaves under low signal-to-noise conditions.

RF signal generators are available as benchtop instruments, rackmount instruments, embeddable modules and in card-level formats. Mobile, field-testing and airborne applications benefit from lighter, battery-operated platforms. In automated and production testing, web-browser access, which allows multi-source control, and faster frequency switching speeds improve test times and throughput.

RF signal generators are required for servicing and setting up radio receivers, and are used for professional RF applications.

RF signal generators are characterized by their frequency bands, power capabilities (−100 to +25 dBc), single side band phase noise at various carrier frequencies, spurs and harmonics, frequency and amplitude switching speeds and modulation capabilities.

;AF
Audio-frequency signal generators generate signals in the audio-frequency range and above. An early example was the HP200A audio oscillator, the first product sold by the Hewlett-Packard Company in 1939. Applications include checking frequency response of audio equipment, and many uses in the electronic laboratory.

Equipment distortion can be measured using a very-low-distortion audio generator as the signal source, with appropriate equipment to measure output distortion harmonic-by-harmonic with a wave analyser, or simply total harmonic distortion. A distortion of 0.0001% can be achieved by an audio signal generator with a relatively simple circuit.

==== Vector signal generator ====

With the advent of digital communications systems, it is no longer possible to adequately test these systems with traditional analog signal generators. This has led to the development of the vector signal generator, which is also known as a digital signal generator. These signal generators are capable of generating digitally-modulated radio signals that may use any of a large number of digital modulation formats such as QAM, QPSK, FSK, BPSK, and OFDM. In addition, since modern commercial digital communication systems are almost all based on well-defined industry standards, many vector signal generators can generate signals based on these standards. Examples include GSM, W-CDMA (UMTS), CDMA2000, LTE, Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), and WiMAX (IEEE 802.16). In contrast, military communication systems such as JTRS, which place a great deal of importance on robustness and information security, typically use very proprietary methods. To test these types of communication systems, users will often create their own custom waveforms and download them into the vector signal generator to create the desired test signal.

==== Digital pattern generator ====

A logic signal generator or data pattern generator or digital pattern generator produces logic signals—that is, logical 1s and 0s in the form of conventional voltage levels. The usual voltage standards are LVTTL and LVCMOS.
It is different from a &quot;pulse/pattern generator&quot;, which refers to signal generators able to generate logic pulses with different analog characteristics (such as pulse rise/fall time, high level length, ...).

A digital pattern generator is used as stimulus source for digital integrated circuits and embedded systems - for functional validation and testing.

== Special purpose signal generators ==
In addition to the above general-purpose devices, there are several classes of signal generators designed for specific applications.

=== Pitch generators and audio generators ===

A pitch generator is a type of signal generator optimized for use in audio and acoustics applications. Pitch generators typically include sine waves over the human hearing range (20 Hz to 20 kHz). Sophisticated pitch generators will also include sweep generators (a function which varies the output frequency over a range, in order to make frequency-domain measurements), multipitch generators (which output several pitches simultaneously, and are used to check for intermodulation distortion and other non-linear effects), and tone bursts (used to measure response to transients). Pitch generators are typically used in conjunction with sound level meters, when measuring the acoustics of a room or a sound reproduction system, and/or with oscilloscopes or specialized audio analyzers.

Many pitch generators operate in the digital domain, producing output in various digital audio formats such as AES3, or SPDIF. Such generators may include special signals to stimulate various digital effects and problems, such as clipping, jitter, bit errors; they also often provide ways to manipulate the metadata associated with digital audio formats.

The term synthesizer is used for a device that generates audio signals for music, or that uses slightly more intricate methods.

==== Computer programs ====
Computer programs can be used to generate arbitrary waveforms on a general-purpose computer and output the waveform via an output interface. Such programs may be provided commercially or be freeware. Simple systems use a standard computer sound card as output device, limiting the accuracy of the output waveform and limiting frequency to lie within the audio-frequency band.

=== Video signal generator ===

A video signal generator is a device which outputs predetermined video and/or television waveforms, and other signals used to stimulate faults in, or aid in parametric measurements of, television and video systems. There are several different types of video signal generators in widespread use. Regardless of the specific type, the output of a video generator will generally contain synchronization signals appropriate for television, including horizontal and vertical sync pulses (in analog) or sync words (in digital). Generators of &quot;composite&quot; video signals (such as NTSC and PAL) will also include a colorburst signal as part of the output. Video signal generators are available for a wide variety of applications and for a wide variety of digital formats; many of these also include audio generation capability (as the audio track is an important part of any video or television program or motion picture).

<doc id="41928" wikidata="Q550593" url="?curid=41928" title="Klein four-group">
<text>In mathematics, the Klein four-group is an abelian group with four elements, in which each element is self-inverse (composing it with itself produces the identity) and in which composing any two of the three non-identity elements produces the third one. It can be described as the symmetry group of a non-square rectangle (with the three non-identity elements being horizontal reflection, vertical reflection and 180-degree rotation), as the group of bitwise exclusive-or operations on two-bit binary values, or more abstractly as formula_1, the direct product of two copies of the cyclic group of order 2 by the Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups. It was named Vierergruppe (, meaning four-group) by Felix Klein in 1884. It is also called the Klein group, and is often symbolized by the letter formula_2 or as formula_3.

The Klein four-group, with four elements, is the smallest group that is not cyclic. Up to isomorphism, there is only one other group of order four: the cyclic group of order 4. Both groups are abelian.

== Presentations ==
The Klein group&#x27;s Cayley table is given by:
The Klein four-group is also defined by the group presentation
: formula_4

All non-identity elements of the Klein group have order 2, so any two non-identity elements can serve as generators in the above presentation. The Klein four-group is the smallest non-cyclic group. It is, however, an abelian group, and isomorphic to the dihedral group of order (cardinality) 4, symbolized formula_5 (or formula_6, using the geometric convention); other than the group of order 2, it is the only dihedral group that is abelian.

The Klein four-group is also isomorphic to the direct sum formula_7, so that it can be represented as the pairs under component-wise addition modulo 2 (or equivalently the bit strings under bitwise XOR), with (0,0) being the group&#x27;s identity element. The Klein four-group is thus an example of an elementary abelian 2-group, which is also called a Boolean group. The Klein four-group is thus also the group generated by the symmetric difference as the binary operation on the subsets of a powerset of a set with two elements—that is, over a field of sets with four elements, such as formula_8; the empty set is the group&#x27;s identity element in this case.

Another numerical construction of the Klein four-group is the set , with the operation being multiplication modulo 8. Here &quot;a&quot; is 3, &quot;b&quot; is 5, and is .

The Klein four-group also has a representation as real matrices with the operation being matrix multiplication:
: formula_9
: formula_10

On a Rubik&#x27;s Cube, the &quot;4 dots&quot; pattern can be made in three ways (for example, M2 U2 M2 U2 F2 M2 F2), depending on the pair of faces that are left blank; these three positions together with the solved position form an example of the Klein group, with the solved position serving as the identity.

== Geometry ==

In two dimensions, the Klein four-group is the symmetry group of a rhombus and of rectangles that are not squares, the four elements being the identity, the vertical reflection, the horizontal reflection, and a 180° rotation.

In three dimensions, there are three different symmetry groups that are algebraically the Klein four-group:
* one with three perpendicular 2-fold rotation axes: the dihedral group formula_6
* one with a 2-fold rotation axis, and a perpendicular plane of reflection: formula_12
* one with a 2-fold rotation axis in a plane of reflection (and hence also in a perpendicular plane of reflection): formula_13.

== Permutation representation ==
The three elements of order two in the Klein four-group are interchangeable: the automorphism group of &quot;V&quot; is thus the group of permutations of these three elements, that is, the symmetric group formula_14.

The Klein four-group&#x27;s permutations of its own elements can be thought of abstractly as its permutation representation on four points:
:formula_15{(), (1,2)(3,4), (1,3)(2,4), (1,4)(2,3)}

In this representation, formula_2 is a normal subgroup of the alternating group formula_17 (and also the symmetric group formula_18) on four letters. It is also a transitive subgroup of formula_18that appears as a Galois group. In fact, it is the kernel of a surjective group homomorphism from formula_18 to formula_14.

Other representations within &quot;S&quot;4 are:
: 

They are not normal subgroups of &quot;S&quot;4.
== Algebra ==
According to Galois theory, the existence of the Klein four-group (and in particular, the permutation representation of it) explains the existence of the formula for calculating the roots of quartic equations in terms of radicals, as established by Lodovico Ferrari: the map formula_22 corresponds to the resolvent cubic, in terms of Lagrange resolvents.

In the construction of finite rings, eight of the eleven rings with four elements have the Klein four-group as their additive substructure.

If formula_23 denotes the multiplicative group of non-zero reals and formula_24 the multiplicative group of positive reals, then formula_25 is the group of units of the ring formula_26, and formula_27 is a subgroup of formula_25 (in fact it is the component of the identity of formula_25). The quotient group formula_30 is isomorphic to the Klein four-group. In a similar fashion, the group of units of the split-complex number ring, when divided by its identity component, also results in the Klein four-group.

== Graph theory ==
Among the simple connected graphs, the simplest (in the sense of having the fewest entities) that admits the Klein four-group as its automorphism group is the diamond graph shown below. It is also the automorphism group of some other graphs that are simpler in the sense of having fewer entities. These include the graph with four vertices and one edge, which remains simple but loses connectivity, and the graph with two vertices connected to each other by two edges, which remains connected but loses simplicity.

== Music ==
In music composition, the four-group is the basic group of permutations in the twelve-tone technique. In that instance, the Cayley table is written

<doc id="41930" wikidata="Q181201" url="?curid=41930" title="Dividend">
<text>A dividend is a distribution of profits by a corporation to its shareholders, after which the stock exchange decreases the price of the stock by the dividend to remove volatility. The market has no control over the stock price on open on the ex-dividend date, though more often than not it may open higher. When a corporation earns a profit or surplus, it is able to pay a portion of the profit as a dividend to shareholders. Any amount not distributed is taken to be re-invested in the business (called retained earnings). The current year profit as well as the retained earnings of previous years are available for distribution; a corporation is usually prohibited from paying a dividend out of its capital. Distribution to shareholders may be in cash (usually by bank transfer) or, if the corporation has a dividend reinvestment plan, the amount can be paid by the issue of further shares or by share repurchase. In some cases, the distribution may be of assets.

The dividend received by a shareholder is income of the shareholder and may be subject to income tax (see dividend tax). The tax treatment of this income varies considerably between jurisdictions. The corporation does not receive a tax deduction for the dividends it pays.

A dividend is allocated as a fixed amount per share, with shareholders receiving a dividend in proportion to their shareholding. Dividends can provide at least temporarily stable income and raise morale among shareholders, but are not guaranteed to continue. For the joint-stock company, paying dividends is not an expense; rather, it is the division of after-tax profits among shareholders. Retained earnings (profits that have not been distributed as dividends) are shown in the shareholders&#x27; equity section on the company&#x27;s balance sheet – the same as its issued share capital. Public companies usually pay dividends on a fixed schedule, but may cancel a scheduled dividend, or declare an unscheduled dividend at any time, sometimes called a special dividend to distinguish it from the regular dividends. (more usually a special dividend is paid at the same time as the regular dividend, but for a one-off higher amount). Cooperatives, on the other hand, allocate dividends according to members&#x27; activity, so their dividends are often considered to be a pre-tax expense.

The usually fixed payments to holders of preference shares (or preferred stock in American English) are classed as dividends. The word &quot;dividend&quot; comes from the Latin word (&quot;thing to be divided&quot;).

==History==

In the financial history of the world, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) was the first recorded (public) company ever to pay regular dividends. The VOC paid annual dividends worth around 18 percent of the value of the shares for almost 200 years of existence (1602–1800).

In common-law jurisdictions, courts have typically refused to intervene in companies&#x27; dividend policies, giving directors wide discretion as to the declaration or payment of dividends. The principle of non-interference was established in the Canadian case of &quot;Burland v Earle&quot; (1902), the British case of &quot;Bond v Barrow Haematite Steel Co&quot; (1902), and the Australian case of &quot;Miles v Sydney Meat-Preserving Co Ltd&quot; (1912). However in &quot;Sumiseki Materials Co Ltd v Wambo Coal Pty Ltd&quot; (2013) the Supreme Court of New South Wales broke with this precedent and recognised a shareholder&#x27;s contractual right to a dividend.

==Forms of payment==
Cash dividends are the most common form of payment and are paid out in currency, usually via electronic funds transfer or a printed paper check. Such dividends are a form of investment income of the shareholder, usually treated as earned in the year they are paid (and not necessarily in the year a dividend was declared). For each share owned, a declared amount of money is distributed. Thus, if a person owns 100 shares and the cash dividend is 50 cents per share, the holder of the stock will be paid $50. Dividends paid are not classified as an expense, but rather a deduction of retained earnings. Dividends paid does not appear on an income statement, but does appear on the balance sheet.

Different classes of stocks have different priorities when it comes to dividend payments. Preferred stocks have priority claims on a company&#x27;s income. A company must pay dividends on its preferred shares before distributing income to common share shareholders.

Stock or scrip dividends are those paid out in the form of additional shares of the issuing corporation, or another corporation (such as its subsidiary corporation). They are usually issued in proportion to shares owned (for example, for every 100 shares of stock owned, a 5% stock dividend will yield 5 extra shares).

Nothing tangible will be gained if the stock is split because the total number of shares increases, lowering the price of each share, without changing the total value of the shares held. (See also Stock dilution.)

Stock dividend distributions do not affect the market capitalization of a company. Stock dividends are not includable in the gross income of the shareholder for US income tax purposes. Because the shares are issued for proceeds equal to the pre-existing market price of the shares; there is no negative dilution in the amount recoverable.

Property dividends or dividends &quot;in specie&quot; (Latin for &quot;in kind&quot;) are those paid out in the form of assets from the issuing corporation or another corporation, such as a subsidiary corporation. They are relatively rare and most frequently are securities of other companies owned by the issuer, however, they can take other forms, such as products and services.

Interim dividends are dividend payments made before a company&#x27;s Annual General Meeting (AGM) and final financial statements. This declared dividend usually accompanies the company&#x27;s interim financial statements.

Other dividends can be used in structured finance. Financial assets with known market value can be distributed as dividends; warrants are sometimes distributed in this way. For large companies with subsidiaries, dividends can take the form of shares in a subsidiary company. A common technique for &quot;spinning off&quot; a company from its parent is to distribute shares in the new company to the old company&#x27;s shareholders. The new shares can then be traded independently.

==Payout ratio==
A dividend payout ratio characterizes how much of a company&#x27;s earnings (or its cash flow) is paid out in the form of dividends.

Most often, the payout ratio is calculated based on dividends per share and earnings per share:

A payout ratio greater than 100% means the company paid out more in dividends for the year than it earned.

Since earnings are an accountancy measure, they do not necessarily closely correspond to the actual cash flow of the company. Hence another way to determine the safety of a dividend is to replace earnings in the payout ratio by free cash flow. Free cash flow is the business&#x27;s operating cash flow minus its capital expenditures. It&#x27;s a measure of how much incoming cash is &quot;free&quot; to pay out to stockholders and/or to grow the business.

A free cash flow payout ratio greater than 100% means the company paid out more cash in dividends for the year than the &quot;free&quot; cash it took in.

==Dividend dates==
A dividend that is declared must be approved by a company&#x27;s board of directors before it is paid. For public companies in the US, four dates are relevant regarding dividends: The position in the UK is very similar, except that the expression &quot;in-dividend date&quot; is not used.

Declaration date – the day the board of directors announces its intention to pay a dividend. On that day, a liability is created and the company records that liability on its books; it now owes the money to the shareholders.

In-dividend date – the last day, which is one trading day before the &quot;ex-dividend date&quot;, where shares are said to be &quot;cum dividend&quot; (&#x27;with [including] dividend&#x27;). That is, existing shareholders and anyone who buys the shares on this day will receive the dividend, and any shareholders who have sold the shares lose their right to the dividend. After this date the shares becomes &quot;ex dividend&quot;.

Ex-dividend date – the day on which shares bought and sold no longer come attached with the right to be paid the most recently declared dividend. In the United States and many European countries, it is typically one trading day before the &quot;record date&quot;. This is an important date for any company that has many shareholders, including those that trade on exchanges, to enable reconciliation of who is entitled to be paid the dividend. Existing shareholders will receive the dividend even if they sell the shares on or after that date, whereas anyone who bought the shares will not receive the dividend. It is relatively common for a share&#x27;s price to decrease on the ex-dividend date by an amount roughly equal to the dividend being paid, which reflects the decrease in the company&#x27;s assets resulting from the payment of the dividend.

Book closure date – when a company announces a dividend, it will also announce the date on which the company will temporarily close its books for share transfers, which is also usually the record date.

Record date – shareholders registered in the company&#x27;s record as of the record date will be paid the dividend, while shareholders who are not registered as of this date will not receive the dividend. Registration in most countries is essentially automatic for shares purchased before the ex-dividend date.

Payment date – the day on which dividend cheques will actually be mailed to shareholders or the dividend amount credited to their bank account.

== Dividend frequency ==
The dividend frequency is the number of dividend payments within a single business year. The most usual dividend frequencies are yearly, semi-annually, quarterly and monthly. Some common dividend frequencies are quarterly in the US, semi-annually in Japan, UK and Australia and annually in Germany.

==Dividend-reinvestment==

Some companies have dividend reinvestment plans, or DRIPs, not to be confused with scrips. DRIPs allow shareholders to use dividends to systematically buy small amounts of stock, usually with no commission and sometimes at a slight discount. In some cases, the shareholder might not need to pay taxes on these re-invested dividends, but in most cases they do. Utilizing a DRIP is a powerful investment tool because it takes advantage of both dollar cost averaging and compounding. Dollar cost averaging is the principle of investing a set amount of capital at recurring intervals. In this case, if the dividend is paid quarterly, then every quarter you are investing a set amount (the number of shares you own multiplied by the dividend per share). By doing this, you buy more shares when the price is low and fewer when the price is high. Additionally, the fractional shares that are purchased then begin paying dividends, compounding your investment and increasing the number of shares and total dividend earned each time a dividend distribution is made.

==Law and government policy on dividends==

Governments may adopt policies on dividend distribution for the protection of shareholders and the preservation of company viability, as well as treating dividends as a potential source of revenue.

Most countries impose a corporate tax on the profits made by a company. Many jurisdictions also impose a tax on dividends paid by a company to its shareholders (stockholders), but the tax treatment of a dividend income varies considerably between jurisdictions. The primary tax liability is that of the shareholder, although a tax obligation may also be imposed on the corporation in the form of a withholding tax. In some cases, the withholding tax may be the extent of the tax liability in relation to the dividend. A dividend tax is in addition to any tax imposed directly on the corporation on its profits.

A dividend paid by a company is not an expense of the company.

===Australia and New Zealand===
Australia and New Zealand have a dividend imputation system, wherein companies can attach franking credits or imputation credits to dividends. These franking credits represent the tax paid by the company upon its pre-tax profits. One dollar of company tax paid generates one franking credit. Companies can attach any proportion of franking up to a maximum amount that is calculated from the prevailing company tax rate: for each dollar of dividend paid, the maximum level of franking is the company tax rate divided by (1 − company tax rate). At the current 30% rate, this works out at 0.30 of a credit per 70 cents of dividend, or 42.857 cents per dollar of dividend. The shareholders who are able to use them, apply these credits against their income tax bills at a rate of a dollar per credit, thereby effectively eliminating the double taxation of company profits.

===India===
In India, a company declaring or distributing dividends is required to pay a Corporate Dividend Tax in addition to the tax levied on their income. The dividend received by the shareholders is then exempt in their hands. Dividend-paying firms in India fell from 24 percent in 2001 to almost 19 percent in 2009 before rising to 19 percent in 2010. However, dividend income over and above attracts 10 percent dividend tax in the hands of the shareholder with effect from April 2016. Since the Budget 2020–2021, DDT has been abolished. Now, the Indian government taxes dividend income in the hands of investor according to income tax slab rates.

===United States and Canada===
The United States and Canada impose a lower tax rate on dividend income than ordinary income, on the assertion that company profits had already been taxed as corporate tax. In the United States, shareholders of corporations face double taxation – taxes on both corporate profits and taxes on distribution of dividends.

===United Kingdom===
The rules in Part 23 of the Companies Act 2006 (sections 829–853) govern the payment of dividends to shareholders. The Act refers in this section to &quot;distribution&quot;, covering any kind of distribution of a company&#x27;s assets to its members (with some exceptions), &quot;whether in cash or otherwise&quot;. A company is only able to make a distribution out of its accumulated, realised profits, &quot;so far as not previously utilised by distribution or capitalisation, less its accumulated, realised losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganisation of capital duly made&quot;.

The United Kingdom government announced in 2018 that it was considering a review of the existing rules on dividend distribution following a consultation exercise on insolvency and corporate governance. The aim was to address concerns which had emerged where companies in financial distress were still able to distribute &quot;significant dividends&quot; to their shareholders. A requirement has been proposed under which the largest companies would be required to publish a distribution policy statement covering dividend distribution.

The law in England and Wales regarding dividend payment was clarified in 2018 by the England and Wales Court of Appeal in the case of &quot;Global Corporate Ltd v Hale&quot; [2018] EWCA Civ 2618. Certain payments made to a director/shareholder had been treated by the High Court as &quot;quantum meruit&quot; payments to Hale in his capacity as a company director but the Appeal Court reversed this judgment and treated the payments as dividends. At the time of payment they had been treated as &quot;dividends&quot; payable from an anticipated profit. The company subsequently went into liquidation; an attempt to recharacterise the payments as payments for services rendered was held to be unlawful.

==Effect on stock price==
After a stock goes ex-dividend (when a dividend has just been paid, so there is no anticipation of another imminent dividend payment), the stock price should drop.

To calculate the amount of the drop, the traditional method is to view the financial effects of the dividend from the perspective of the company. Since the company has paid say £&quot;x&quot; in dividends per share out of its cash account on the left hand side of the balance sheet, the equity account on the right side should decrease an equivalent amount. This means that a £&quot;x&quot; dividend should result in a £&quot;x&quot; drop in the share price.

A more accurate method of calculating the fall in price is to look at the share price and dividend from the after-tax perspective of a shareholder. The after-tax drop in the share price (or capital gain/loss) should be equivalent to the after-tax dividend. For example, if the tax of capital gains &quot;T&quot;cg is 35%, and the tax on dividends &quot;T&quot;d is 15%, then a £1 dividend is equivalent to £0.85 of after-tax money. To get the same financial benefit from a, the after-tax capital loss value should equal £0.85. The pre-tax capital loss would be = = = £1.31. In this case, a dividend of £1 has led to a larger drop in the share price of £1.31, because the tax rate on capital losses is higher than the dividend tax rate. However in many countries the stock market is dominated by institutions which pay no additional tax on dividends received (as opposed to tax on overall profits). If that is the case, then the share price should fall by the full amount of the dividend.

Finally, security analysis that does not take dividends into account may mute the decline in share price, for example in the case of a price–earnings ratio target that does not back out cash; or amplify the decline when comparing different periods.

The effect of a dividend payment on share price is an important reason why it can sometimes be desirable to exercise an American option early.

===Criticism and analysis===
Some believe company profits are best re-invested in the company with actions such as research and development, capital investment or expansion. Proponents of this view (and thus critics of dividends per se) suggest that an eagerness to return profits to shareholders may indicate the management having run out of good ideas for the future of the company. A counter-argument to this position came from Peter Lynch of Fidelity investments, who declared: &quot;One strong argument in favor of companies that pay dividends is that companies that don’t pay dividends have a sorry history of blowing the money on a string of stupid diworseifications&quot;; using his self-created term for diversification that results in worse effects, not better. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that companies that pay dividends have higher earnings growth, suggesting dividend payments may be evidence of confidence in earnings growth and sufficient profitability to fund future expansion. Benjamin Graham and David Dodd wrote in &quot;Securities Analysis&quot; (1934): &quot;The prime purpose of a business corporation is to pay dividends to its owners. A successful company is one that can pay dividends regularly and presumably increase the rate as time goes on.&quot;

Other studies indicate that dividend-paying stocks tend to offer superior long-term performance relative to the overall market at least in developed economies, relative to a stock index such as the S&amp;P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average or relative to stocks that do not pay dividends. Several explanations have been proposed for this outperformance such as dividends being associated with value stocks which are themselves associated with long-term outperformance; being more durable in crashes or bear markets; being associated with profitable companies exhibiting high levels of free cashflow; and being associated with mature, unfashionable companies that are overlooked by many investors and thus an effective contrarian strategy. Asset managers at Tweedy, Browne and Capital Group have suggested dividends are an effective measure of a given company&#x27;s overall financial status.

Shareholders in companies that pay little or no cash dividends can potentially reap the benefit of the company&#x27;s profits when they sell their shareholding, or when a company is wound down and all assets liquidated and distributed amongst shareholders. However, data from professor Jeremy Siegel found stocks that do not pay dividends tend to have worse long-term performance, as a group, than the general stock market and also perform worse than dividend-paying stocks.

====Tax implications====
Taxation of dividends is often used as justification for retaining earnings, or for performing a stock buyback, in which the company buys back stock, thereby increasing the value of the stock left outstanding.

When dividends are paid, individual shareholders in many countries suffer from double taxation of those dividends:
# the company pays income tax to the government when it earns any income, and then
# when the dividend is paid, the individual shareholder pays income tax on the dividend payment.
In many countries, the tax rate on dividend income is lower than for other forms of income to compensate for tax paid at the corporate level.
A capital gain should not be confused with a dividend. Generally, a capital gain occurs where a capital asset is sold for an amount greater than the amount of its cost at the time the investment was purchased. A dividend is a parsing out a share of the profits, and is taxed at the dividend tax rate. If there is an increase of value of stock, and a shareholder chooses to sell the stock, the shareholder will pay a tax on capital gains (often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income). If a holder of the stock chooses to not participate in the buyback, the price of the holder&#x27;s shares could rise (as well as it could fall), but the tax on these gains is delayed until the sale of the shares.

Certain types of specialized investment companies (such as a REIT in the U.S.) allow the shareholder to partially or fully avoid double taxation of dividends.

==Other corporate entities==

===Cooperatives===
Cooperative businesses may retain their earnings, or distribute part or all of them as dividends to their members. They distribute their dividends in proportion to their members&#x27; activity, instead of the value of members&#x27; shareholding. Therefore, co-op dividends are often treated as pre-tax expenses. In other words, local tax or accounting rules may treat a dividend as a form of customer rebate or a staff bonus to be deducted from turnover before profit (tax profit or operating profit) is calculated.

Consumers&#x27; cooperatives allocate dividends according to their members&#x27; trade with the co-op. For example, a credit union will pay a dividend to represent interest on a saver&#x27;s deposit. A retail co-op store chain may return a percentage of a member&#x27;s purchases from the co-op, in the form of cash, store credit, or equity. This type of dividend is sometimes known as a patronage dividend or patronage refund, as well as being informally named &quot;divi&quot; or &quot;divvy&quot;.

Producer cooperatives, such as worker cooperatives, allocate dividends according to their members&#x27; contribution, such as the hours they worked or their salary.

===Trusts===
In real estate investment trusts and royalty trusts, the distributions paid often will be consistently greater than the company earnings. This can be sustainable because the accounting earnings do not recognize any increasing value of real estate holdings and resource reserves. If there is no economic increase in the value of the company&#x27;s assets then the excess distribution (or dividend) will be a return of capital and the book value of the company will have shrunk by an equal amount. This may result in capital gains which may be taxed differently from dividends representing distribution of earnings.

The distribution of profits by other forms of mutual organization also varies from that of joint-stock companies, though may not take the form of a dividend.

In the case of mutual insurance, for example, in the United States, a distribution of profits to holders of participating life policies is called a &quot;dividend&quot;.
These profits are generated by the investment returns of the insurer&#x27;s general account, in which premiums are invested and from which claims are paid. The participating dividend may be used to decrease premiums, or to increase the cash value of the policy.
Some life policies pay nonparticipating dividends.
As a contrasting example, in the United Kingdom, the surrender value of a with-profits policy is increased by a &quot;bonus&quot;, which also serves the purpose of distributing profits.
Life insurance dividends and bonuses, while typical of mutual insurance, are also paid by some joint stock insurers.

Insurance dividend payments are not restricted to life policies. For example, general insurer State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company can distribute dividends to its vehicle insurance policyholders.

<text>Accuracy and precision are two measures of &quot;observational error&quot;.
Accuracy is how close a given set of measurements (observations or readings) are to their &quot;true value&quot;.
Precision is how close the measurements are to each other.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines a related measure:
trueness, &quot;the closeness of agreement between the arithmetic mean of a large number of test results and the true or accepted reference value.&quot;
While &quot;precision&quot; is a description of &quot;random errors&quot; (a measure of statistical variability),
&quot;accuracy&quot; has two different definitions:
# More commonly, a description of &quot;systematic errors&quot; (a measure of statistical bias of a given measure of central tendency, such as the mean). In this definition of &quot;accuracy&quot;, the concept is independent of &quot;precision&quot;, so a particular set of data can be said to be accurate, precise, both, or neither. This concept corresponds to ISO&#x27;s &quot;trueness&quot;. 
# A combination of both precision and trueness, accounting for the two types of observational error (random and systematic), so that high accuracy requires both high precision and high trueness. This usage corresponds to ISO&#x27;s definition of &quot;accuracy&quot; (trueness and precision).

==Common technical definition==
In simpler terms, given a statistical sample or set of data points from repeated measurements of the same quantity, the sample or set can be said to be &quot;accurate&quot; if their average is close to the true value of the quantity being measured, while the set can be said to be &quot;precise&quot; if their standard deviation is relatively small.

In the fields of science and engineering, the accuracy of a measurement system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantity&#x27;s true value. The precision of a measurement system, related to reproducibility and repeatability, is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results. Although the two words precision and accuracy can be synonymous in colloquial use, they are deliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method.

The field of statistics, where the interpretation of measurements plays a central role, prefers to use the terms &quot;bias&quot; and &quot;variability&quot; instead of accuracy and precision: bias is the amount of inaccuracy and variability is the amount of imprecision.

A measurement system can be accurate but not precise, precise but not accurate, neither, or both. For example, if an experiment contains a systematic error, then increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not improve accuracy. The result would be a consistent yet inaccurate string of results from the flawed experiment. Eliminating the systematic error improves accuracy but does not change precision.

A measurement system is considered &quot;valid&quot; if it is both &quot;accurate&quot; and &quot;precise&quot;. Related terms include &quot;bias&quot; (non-random or directed effects caused by a factor or factors unrelated to the independent variable) and &quot;error&quot; (random variability).

The terminology is also applied to indirect measurements—that is, values obtained by a computational procedure from observed data.

In addition to accuracy and precision, measurements may also have a measurement resolution, which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a response in the measurement.

In numerical analysis, accuracy is also the nearness of a calculation to the true value; while precision is the resolution of the representation, typically defined by the number of decimal or binary digits.

In military terms, accuracy refers primarily to the accuracy of fire (&quot;justesse de tir&quot;), the precision of fire expressed by the closeness of a grouping of shots at and around the centre of the target.
A shift in the meaning of these terms appeared with the publication of the ISO 5725 series of standards in 1994, which is also reflected in the 2008 issue of the BIPM International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM), items 2.13 and 2.14.

According to ISO 5725-1, the general term &quot;accuracy&quot; is used to describe the closeness of a measurement to the true value. When the term is applied to sets of measurements of the same measurand, it involves a component of random error and a component of systematic error. In this case trueness is the closeness of the mean of a set of measurement results to the actual (true) value, that is the systematic error, and precision is the closeness of agreement among a set of results, that is the random error.

ISO 5725-1 and VIM also avoid the use of the term &quot;bias&quot;, previously specified in BS 5497-1, because it has different connotations outside the fields of science and engineering, as in medicine and law.

==Quantification and applications==

In industrial instrumentation, accuracy is the measurement tolerance, or transmission of the instrument and defines the limits of the errors made when the instrument is used in normal operating conditions.

Ideally a measurement device is both accurate and precise, with measurements all close to and tightly clustered around the true value. The accuracy and precision of a measurement process is usually established by repeatedly measuring some traceable reference standard. Such standards are defined in the International System of Units (abbreviated SI from French: &quot;Système international d&#x27;unités&quot;) and maintained by national standards organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the United States.

This also applies when measurements are repeated and averaged. In that case, the term standard error is properly applied: the precision of the average is equal to the known standard deviation of the process divided by the square root of the number of measurements averaged. Further, the central limit theorem shows that the probability distribution of the averaged measurements will be closer to a normal distribution than that of individual measurements.

With regard to accuracy we can distinguish:
* the difference between the mean of the measurements and the reference value, the bias. Establishing and correcting for bias is necessary for calibration.
* the combined effect of that and precision.

A common convention in science and engineering is to express accuracy and/or precision implicitly by means of significant figures. Where not explicitly stated, the margin of error is understood to be one-half the value of the last significant place. For instance, a recording of 843.6 m, or 843.0 m, or 800.0 m would imply a margin of 0.05 m (the last significant place is the tenths place), while a recording of 843 m would imply a margin of error of 0.5 m (the last significant digits are the units).

A reading of 8,000 m, with trailing zeros and no decimal point, is ambiguous; the trailing zeros may or may not be intended as significant figures. To avoid this ambiguity, the number could be represented in scientific notation: 8.0 × 103 m indicates that the first zero is significant (hence a margin of 50 m) while 8.000 × 103 m indicates that all three zeros are significant, giving a margin of 0.5 m. Similarly, one can use a multiple of the basic measurement unit: 8.0 km is equivalent to 8.0 × 103 m. It indicates a margin of 0.05 km (50 m). However, reliance on this convention can lead to false precision errors when accepting data from sources that do not obey it. For example, a source reporting a number like 153,753 with precision +/- 5,000 looks like it has precision +/- 0.5. Under the convention it would have been rounded to 150,000.

Alternatively, in a scientific context, if it is desired to indicate the margin of error with more precision, one can use a notation such as 7.54398(23) × 10−10 m, meaning a range of between 7.54375 and 7.54421 × 10−10 m.

Precision includes:
* &quot;repeatability&quot; — the variation arising when all efforts are made to keep conditions constant by using the same instrument and operator, and repeating during a short time period; and
* &quot;reproducibility&quot; — the variation arising using the same measurement process among different instruments and operators, and over longer time periods.
In engineering, precision is often taken as three times Standard Deviation of measurements taken, representing the range that 99.73% of measurements can occur within. For example, an ergonomist measuring the human body can be confident that 99.73% of their extracted measurements fall within ± 0.7 cm - if using the GRYPHON processing system - or ± 13 cm - if using unprocessed data.

==In classification==
===In binary classification===

&quot;Accuracy&quot; is also used as a statistical measure of how well a binary classification test correctly identifies or excludes a condition. That is, the accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. As such, it compares estimates of pre- and post-test probability. To make the context clear by the semantics, it is often referred to as the &quot;Rand accuracy&quot; or &quot;Rand index&quot;. It is a parameter of the test.
The formula for quantifying binary accuracy is:
formula_1
where ; ; ; 

In this context, the concepts of trueness and precision as defined by ISO 5725-1 are not applicable. One reason is that there is not a single “true value” of a quantity, but rather two possible true values for every case, while accuracy is an average across all cases and therefore takes into account both values. However, the term &quot;precision&quot; is used in this context to mean a different metric originating from the field of information retrieval (see below).

===In multiclass classification===
When computing accuracy in multiclass classification, accuracy is simply the fraction of correct classifications:
formula_2
This is usually expressed as a percentage. For example, if a classifier makes ten predictions and nine of them are correct, the accuracy is 90%.

Accuracy is sometimes also viewed as a &quot;micro metric&quot;, to underline that it tends to be greatly affected by the particular class prevalence in a dataset and the classifier&#x27;s biases.

Furthermore, it is also called top-1 accuracy to distinguish it from top-5 accuracy, common in convolutional neural network evaluation. To evaluate top-5 accuracy, the classifier must provide relative likelihoods for each class. When these are sorted, a classification is considered correct if the correct classification falls anywhere within the top 5 predictions made by the network. Top-5 accuracy was popularized by the ImageNet challenge. It is usually higher than top-1 accuracy, as any correct predictions in the 2nd through 5th positions will not improve the top-1 score, but do improve the top-5 score.

==In psychometrics and psychophysics==
In psychometrics and psychophysics, the term &quot;accuracy&quot; is interchangeably used with validity and &quot;constant error&quot;. &quot;Precision&quot; is a synonym for reliability and &quot;variable error&quot;. The validity of a measurement instrument or psychological test is established through experiment or correlation with behavior. Reliability is established with a variety of statistical techniques, classically through an internal consistency test like Cronbach&#x27;s alpha to ensure sets of related questions have related responses, and then comparison of those related question between reference and target population.

==In logic simulation==

In logic simulation, a common mistake in evaluation of accurate models is to compare a logic simulation model to a transistor circuit simulation model. This is a comparison of differences in precision, not accuracy. Precision is measured with respect to detail and accuracy is measured with respect to reality.

==In information systems==

Information retrieval systems, such as databases and web search engines, are evaluated by many different metrics, some of which are derived from the confusion matrix, which divides results into true positives (documents correctly retrieved), true negatives (documents correctly not retrieved), false positives (documents incorrectly retrieved), and false negatives (documents incorrectly not retrieved). Commonly used metrics include the notions of precision and recall. In this context, precision is defined as the fraction of documents correctly retrieved compared to the documents retrieved (true positives divided by true positives plus false positives), using a set of ground truth relevant results selected by humans. Recall is defined as the fraction of documents correctly retrieved compared to the relevant documents (true positives divided by true positives plus false negatives). Less commonly, the metric of accuracy is used, is defined as the fraction of documents correctly classified compared to the documents (true positives plus true negatives divided by true positives plus true negatives plus false positives plus false negatives).

None of these metrics take into account the ranking of results. Ranking is very important for web search engines because readers seldom go past the first page of results, and there are too many documents on the web to manually classify all of them as to whether they should be included or excluded from a given search. Adding a cutoff at a particular number of results takes ranking into account to some degree. The measure precision at k, for example, is a measure of precision looking only at the top ten (k=10) search results. More sophisticated metrics, such as discounted cumulative gain, take into account each individual ranking, and are more commonly used where this is important.

==In cognitive systems==
In cognitive systems, accuracy and precision is used to characterize and measure results of a cognitive process performed by biological or artificial entities where a cognitive process is a transformation of data, information, knowledge, or wisdom to a higher-valued form. (DIKW Pyramid) Sometimes, a cognitive process produces exactly the intended or desired output but sometimes produces output far from the intended or desired. Furthermore, repetitions of a cognitive process do not always produce the same output. &quot;Cognitive accuracy&quot; (CA) is the propensity of a cognitive process to produce the intended or desired output. &quot;Cognitive precision&quot; (CP) is the propensity of a cognitive process to produce the same output. To measure augmented cognition in human/cog ensembles, where one or more humans work collaboratively with one or more cognitive systems (cogs), increases in cognitive accuracy and cognitive precision assist in measuring the degree of cognitive augmentation.

<text>Oldenburg (; Northern Low Saxon: &quot;Ollnborg&quot;) is an independent city in the state of Lower Saxony, Germany. The city is officially named Oldenburg (Oldb) (&quot;Oldenburg in Oldenburg&quot;) to distinguish from Oldenburg in Holstein.

During the French annexation (1811–1813) in the wake of the Napoleonic war against Britain, it was also known as &quot;Le Vieux-Bourg&quot; in French. The city is at the rivers Hunte and Haaren, in the northwestern region between the cities of Bremen in the east and Groningen (Netherlands) in the west. According to Germany&#x27;s 2022 census, the city&#x27;s population is 172,759. Oldenburg is part of the Northwest Metropolitan Region, which is home to approximately 2.8 million people.

The city is the place of origin of the House of Oldenburg. Before the end of the German Empire (1918), it was the administrative centre and residence of the monarchs of Oldenburg.

==History==

Archaeological finds point to a settlement dating back to the 8th century. The first documentary evidence, in 1108, referenced &quot;Aldenburg&quot; in connection with Elimar I (also known as Egilmar I) who is now commonly seen as the first count of Oldenburg. The town gained importance due to its location at a ford of the navigable Hunte river. Oldenburg became the capital of the County of Oldenburg (later a Duchy (1774–1810), Grand Duchy (1815–1918), and Free State (1918–1946)), a small state in the shadow of the much more powerful Hanseatic city of Bremen.

In the 17th century Oldenburg was a wealthy town in a time of war and turmoil and its population and power grew considerably. In 1667, the town was struck by a disastrous plague epidemic and, shortly after, a fire destroyed Oldenburg. The Danish kings, who were also counts of Oldenburg at the time, had little interest in the condition of the town and it lost most of its former importance. In 1773, Danish rule ended. Only then were the destroyed buildings in the city rebuilt in a neoclassicist style. (German-speakers usually call the &quot;neoclassicist style&quot; of that period &#x27;, while &#x27; specifically refers to the classicist style of the early 20th century.)
After the German government announced the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II (9 November 1918) following the exhaustion and defeat of the German Empire in World War I, monarchic rule ended in Oldenburg as well with the abdication of Grand Duke Frederick Augustus II of Oldenburg &quot;()&quot; on 11 November 1918. The Grand Duchy now became the Free State of Oldenburg &quot;()&quot;, with the city remaining the capital.

In the 1928 city elections, the Nazi Party received 9.8% of the vote, enough for a seat on the Oldenburg city council. In the September 1930 Oldenburg state elections, the Nazi Party&#x27;s share of the vote rose to 27.3%, and on May 29, 1932, the Nazi Party received 48.4% in the state election, enough to put the Nazi party in charge of forming a state government and, significantly, making Oldenburg the first state in the country to put the Nazis in power based on electoral turnout. By that autumn, a campaign of Aryanization began, forcing the sale of formerly Jewish-owned properties at steep discounts.

In 1945, after World War II, the State of Oldenburg became part of the British zone of occupation. The British military government of the Oldenburg region resided in the city. Several displaced-persons camps were set up in the city that had suffered only 1.4% destruction during the bombing campaigns of World War II. About 42,000 refugees migrated into Oldenburg, which raised the number of residents to over 100,000. In 1946 the Free State of Oldenburg was dissolved and the area became the &#x27;Administrative District&#x27; of Oldenburg &quot;()&quot; within the newly formed federal German state of Lower Saxony &quot;()&quot;. The city was now capital of the district. In 1978 the district was dissolved and succeeded by the newly formed Weser-Ems administrative region &quot;()&quot;, again with the city as administrative capital. The state of Lower Saxony dissolved all of the by the end of 2004 in the course of administrative reforms.

==Climate==

==City government==

Local elections take place every five years. The city council &quot;(Stadtrat)&quot; has 50 seats. The lord mayor &quot;(Oberbürgermeister)&quot; is elected directly by the citizens.

==Economy and infrastructure==

===Transport===
The city centre of Oldenburg is surrounded by a ring of freeways (autobahns) consisting of A 28, A 29 and A 293. Because of this, Oldenburg is connected to the nationwide network of federal autobahns, as well as to the international E-road network (German: &quot;Europastraßen&quot;).

Oldenburg Central Station, &quot;Oldenburg (Oldb) Hauptbahnhof&quot;, is at the intersection of the railway lines Norddeich Mole—Leer—Oldenburg—Bremen and Wilhelmshaven—Oldenburg—Osnabrück, with Intercity services to Berlin, Leipzig and Dresden and InterCityExpress services to Frankfurt and Munich.

Oldenburg is only about half an hour drive from Bremen Airport (about 50 km | 31 miles). Other international airports nearby are Hamburg Airport (160 km | 100 miles) and Hannover-Langenhagen Airport (170 km | 106 miles).

The small Hatten Airfield, (Flugplatz Oldenburg-Hatten ICAO airport code: EDWH), is located about 17 km south-west of Oldenburg. It serves to small aircraft (private planes, gliders, balloons, and helicopters). A flight training school is also located there, and small planes can be chartered. Scenic flights can be booked as well.

Oldenburg is connected to shipping through the Küstenkanal, a ship canal connecting the rivers Ems and Weser. With 1.6 million tons of goods annually, it is the most important non-coastal harbour in Lower Saxony.

Bicycles play a very important part in personal transport.

===Agriculture===
The city is surrounded by large agricultural areas, about 80% of which is grassland. There are farms near and even a few within city limits. Predominant agricultural activities of the region are the cultivation of livestock, especially dairy cows and other grazing animals, crops such as grains for food and animal feed, as well as asparagus, corn, and kale.

===Industry===
Sea salt production in the Oldenburg region has been used since the 15th century to supply the huge salt demand in the Baltic region. Peat extraction in the area continued for many centuries until it was replaced by coal mines.

==Demographics==
As of 31.12.2019 Oldenburg had 169,960 residents. 24.8% of the population were first or second generation immigrants.

==Cultural life==
===Recurring cultural events===
* &quot;Kultursommer&quot; (summer of culture), series of free musical and other cultural events in the city centre during summer holiday season in July.
* &quot;CSD Nordwest (Christopher Street Day)&quot; parade of the regional Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender community in June, with up to 10,000 participants (since 1995).
* &quot;Stadtfest&quot;, a three-day festival of the city centre in August/September, comprises gastronomical offerings and rock and pop music performances on various stages.
* &quot;Oldenburg International Film Festival&quot;, a privately organised film festival in September, focused on independent film and film makers. The festival is funded through public subsidies and private sponsoring.
* &quot;Kramermarkt&quot;, fun fair at the Weser-Ems Halle on ten days in September/October. The tradition of this annual volksfest dates back to the 17th century, when the Kramermarkt was a market event at the end of the harvest.
* &quot;Oldenburger Kinder- und Jugendbuchmesse (KIBUM)&quot;, an exhibition of new German language children&#x27;s and youth literature, takes place over 11 days in November. A non-commercial fair organised by the city government in cooperation with the public library and the university library. In the course of the fair, a prize, the &quot;Kinder- und Jugendbuchpreis&quot;, is awarded to a debuting author or illustrator.

===Points of interest===
* Core city centre, large pedestrianized shopping destination for the region.
* Oldenburg State Theatre, oldest mainstream theatre in Oldenburg, first opened in 1833.
* Schloss Oldenburg in the city centre, until 1918 residence of the monarchic rulers of Oldenburg, today a museum. A public park, the &quot;Schlossgarten&quot;, is nearby.

===Lutheran community===
Oldenburg is the seat of administration and bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Oldenburg, whose preaching venue is the St Lamberti Church.

===Jewish community===

The history of the Jewish community of Oldenburg dates back to the 14th century. Towards and during the 19th century, the Jews in Oldenburg were always around 1% of the total population, and by that time had acquired their own synagogue, cemetery and school. Most of them were merchants and businessmen. On 1938 Kristallnacht, the town men were led to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, among them Leo Trepp, the community Rabbi who survived and later became an honorary citizen of Oldenburg and honored by a street named after him. Since 1981 an annual commemoration walk (Erinnerungsgang) has been held by Oldenburg citizens in memory of the deportation of the Oldenburg Jews on November 10, 1938. Those who remained after 1938 emigrated to Canada, USA, United Kingdom, Holland or Mandatory Palestine.

After World War II, a group of survivors returned to the city and maintained a small community until it was dissolved during the 1970s. Nevertheless, due to Jewish emigration from the former USSR to Germany in the 1990s, a community of about 340 people is now maintaining its own synagogue, cemetery and other facilities. The old Jewish cemetery, which is no longer active after the opening of a new one, was desecrated twice in 2011 and 2013.

===Tertiary education===

There are two public universities in Oldenburg:

* The Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg was founded in 1973 based on a previous college for teacher training, the &quot;Pädagogische Hochschule Oldenburg&quot;, which had a history in Oldenburg dating back to 1793. The university was officially named after Carl von Ossietzky in 1991. As of 2014, it has almost 13,746 students, a scientific staff of 1,130, as well as 964 technical and administrative staff. A new faculty of medicine and health sciences was established in 2012 as part of the newly founded &quot;European Medical School Oldenburg-Groningen&quot;, a cooperation with the University of Groningen (Netherlands) and local hospitals.
* The Jade University of Applied Sciences (Jade-Hochschule) The former &quot;Fachhochschule Oldenburg&quot; (until 1999) was founded in 1971, a merger of the previous engineering academy with the nautical college in Elsfleth. Oldenburg already had a history of construction engineering training dating back to 1882. Starting in 2000, the Fachhochschule had been part of multiple re-organisations involving several UAS (Fachhochschule) in the northwestern region. A relaunch under the name &quot;Jade-Hochschule&quot; took place in 2009 (previously: &quot;Fachhochschule Oldenburg/Ostfriesland/Wilhelmshaven&quot;). The Jade-Hochschule now comprises branches in three towns: Oldenburg, Elsfleth, and Wilhelmshaven. Based in Oldenburg are the departments of architecture, construction engineering and construction management, geodesy, as well as the institute of hearing aid technology and audiology. There are about 2,000 students in the Oldenburg branch. (The Elsfleth branch offers bachelor&#x27;s degree courses in nautical science, international logistics, and harbour management. The Wilhelmshaven branch offers courses in engineering, business management, and media management.)

Privately managed institutions of higher education:

* Founded in 2004, the IBS IT &amp; Business School Oldenburg (former Berufsakademie Oldenburg), a college of cooperative education, offers a B.Sc. degree course in business informatics and a B.A. degree course in business studies. The dual-system course combines practical vocational training at one of the partnering local companies with periods of academic studies.
* The Private Fachhochschule für Wirtschaft und Technik, a regional college of cooperative education, maintains a branch in Oldenburg offering bachelor&#x27;s degree courses with integrated vocational training in electrical engineering and mechatronics.

<text>The Bloomsbury Group was a group of associated British writers, intellectuals, philosophers and artists in the early 20th century. Among the people involved in the group were Virginia Woolf, John Maynard Keynes, E. M. Forster, Vanessa Bell, and Lytton Strachey. Their works and outlook deeply influenced literature, aesthetics, criticism, and economics, as well as modern attitudes towards feminism, pacifism, and sexuality.

Although popularly thought of as a formal group, it was a loose collective of friends and relatives closely associated with the University of Cambridge for the men and King&#x27;s College London for the women, who at one point lived, worked or studied together near Bloomsbury, London. According to Ian Ousby, &quot;although its members denied being a group in any formal sense, they were united by an abiding belief in the importance of the arts.&quot; The historian C. J. Coventry, resurrecting an older argument by Raymond Williams, disputes the existence of the group and the extent of its impact, describing it as &quot;curio&quot; for those interested in Keynes and Woolf.

== Origins ==
All male members of the Bloomsbury Group, except Duncan Grant, were educated at Cambridge (either at Trinity or King&#x27;s College). Most of them, except Clive Bell and the Stephen brothers, were members of &quot;the exclusive Cambridge society, the &#x27;Apostles&#x27;&quot;. At Trinity in 1899 Lytton Strachey, Leonard Woolf, Saxon Sydney-Turner and Clive Bell became good friends with Thoby Stephen, and it was through Thoby and Adrian Stephen&#x27;s sisters Vanessa and Virginia that the men met the women of Bloomsbury when they came down to London.

In 1905 Vanessa began the &quot;Friday Club&quot; and Thoby ran &quot;Thursday Evenings&quot;, which became the basis for the Bloomsbury Group, which to some was really &quot;Cambridge in London&quot;. Thoby&#x27;s premature death in 1906 brought them more firmly together and they became what is now known as the &quot;Old Bloomsbury&quot; group who met in earnest beginning in 1912. In the 1920s and 1930s the group shifted when the original members died and the next generation had reached adulthood.

The Bloomsbury Group, mostly from upper middle-class professional families, formed part of &quot;an intellectual aristocracy which could trace itself back to the Clapham Sect&quot;. It was an informal network of an influential group of artists, art critics, writers and an economist, many of whom lived in the West Central 1 district of London known as Bloomsbury. They were &quot;spiritually&quot; similar to the Clapham group who supported its members&#x27; careers: &quot;The Bloomsberries promoted one another&#x27;s work and careers just as the original Claphamites did, as well as the intervening generations of their grandparents and parents.&quot;

A historical feature of these friends and relations is that their close relationships all pre-dated their fame as writers, artists, and thinkers.

== Membership ==

=== Members ===
The group had ten core members:

* Clive Bell, art critic
* Vanessa Bell, post-impressionist painter
* E. M. Forster, fiction writer
* Roger Fry, art critic and post-impressionist painter
* Duncan Grant, post-impressionist painter
* John Maynard Keynes, economist
* Desmond MacCarthy, literary journalist
* Lytton Strachey, biographer
* Leonard Woolf, essayist and non-fiction writer
* Virginia Woolf, fiction writer and essayist
In addition to these ten, Leonard Woolf, in the 1960s, listed as &quot;Old Bloomsbury&quot; Adrian and Karin Stephen, Saxon Sydney-Turner, and Molly MacCarthy, with Julian Bell, Quentin Bell and Angelica Bell, and David Garnett as &quot;later additions&quot;. Except for Forster, who published three novels before the highly successful &quot;Howards End&quot; in 1910, the group were late developers.

There were stable marriages and varied and complicated affairs among the individual members. Lytton Strachey and his cousin and lover Duncan Grant became close friends of the Stephen sisters, Vanessa Bell and Virginia Woolf. Duncan Grant had affairs with siblings Vanessa Bell and Adrian Stephen, as well as David Garnett, Maynard Keynes, and James Strachey. Clive Bell married Vanessa in 1907, and Leonard Woolf returned from the Ceylon Civil Service to marry Virginia in 1912. Cambridge Apostle friendships brought into the group Desmond MacCarthy, his wife Molly, and E. M. Forster.
The group met not only in their homes in Bloomsbury, central London, but also at countryside retreats. There are two significant ones near Lewes in Sussex: Charleston Farmhouse, where Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant moved in 1916, and Monk&#x27;s House (now owned by the National Trust), in Rodmell, owned by Virginia and Leonard Woolf from 1919.

===Others===
Much about Bloomsbury appears to be controversial, including its membership and name: indeed, some would maintain that &quot;the three words &#x27;the Bloomsbury group&#x27; have been so much used as to have become almost unusable&quot;.

Close friends, brothers, sisters, and even sometimes partners of the friends were not necessarily members of Bloomsbury: Keynes&#x27;s wife Lydia Lopokova was only reluctantly accepted into the group, and there were certainly &quot;writers who were at some time close friends of Virginia Woolf, but who were distinctly not &#x27;Bloomsbury&#x27;: T. S. Eliot, Katherine Mansfield, Hugh Walpole&quot;. Another is Vita Sackville-West, who became &quot;Hogarth Press&#x27;s best-selling author&quot;. Members cited in &quot;other lists might include Ottoline Morrell, or Dora Carrington, or James and Alix Strachey&quot;.

==Shared ideas==

The lives and works of the group members show an overlapping, interconnected similarity of ideas and attitudes that helped to keep the friends and relatives together, reflecting in large part the influence of G. E. Moore: &quot;the essence of what Bloomsbury drew from Moore is contained in his statement that &#x27;one&#x27;s prime objects in life were love, the creation and enjoyment of aesthetic experience and the pursuit of knowledge&#x27;&quot;.

=== Philosophy and ethics ===
Through the Apostles they also encountered the analytic philosophers G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell who were revolutionizing British philosophy at the start of the 20th century. Distinguishing between ends and means was a commonplace of ethics, but what made Moore&#x27;s &quot;Principia Ethica&quot; (1903) so important for the philosophical basis of Bloomsbury thought was Moore&#x27;s conception of &quot;intrinsic worth&quot; as distinct from &quot;instrumental value&quot;. As with the distinction between love (an intrinsic state) and monogamy (a behavior, i.e. instrumental), Moore&#x27;s differentiation between intrinsic and instrumental value allowed the Bloomsburies to maintain an ethical high-ground based on intrinsic merit, independent of, and without reference to, the consequences of their actions. For Moore, intrinsic value depended on an indeterminable intuition of good and a concept of complex states of mind whose worth as a whole was not proportionate to the sum of its parts. For both Moore and Bloomsbury, the greatest ethic goods were &quot;the importance of personal relationships and the private life&quot;, as well as aesthetic appreciation: &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot;.

===Rejection of bourgeois habits===

Bloomsbury reacted against current upper class English social rituals, &quot;the bourgeois habits ... the conventions of Victorian life&quot; with their emphasis on public achievement, in favour of a more informal and private focus on personal relationships and individual pleasure. E. M. Forster for example approved of &quot;the decay of smartness and fashion as factors, and the growth of the idea of enjoyment&quot;, and asserted that &quot;if I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my country&quot;.

The Group &quot;believed in pleasure ... They tried to get the maximum of pleasure out of their personal relations. If this meant triangles or more complicated geometric figures, well then, one accepted that too&quot;. Yet at the same time, they shared a sophisticated, civilized, and highly articulated ideal of pleasure. As Virginia Woolf put it, their &quot;triumph is in having worked out a view of life which was not by any means corrupt or sinister or merely intellectual; rather ascetic and austere indeed; which still holds, and keeps them dining together, and staying together, after 20 years&quot;.

===Politics===
Politically, Bloomsbury held mainly left-liberal stances (opposed to militarism, for example); but its &quot;clubs and meetings were not activist, like the political organisations to which many of Bloomsbury&#x27;s members also belonged&quot;, and they would be criticised for that by their 1930s successors, who by contrast were &quot;heavily touched by the politics which Bloomsbury had rejected&quot;.

The campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage added to the controversial nature of Bloomsbury, as Virginia Woolf represented the group in the fictional &quot;The Years&quot; and &quot;Night and Day&quot; works about the suffrage movement.

===Art===

Roger Fry joined the group in 1910. His Post-Impressionist exhibitions of 1910 and 1912 involved Bloomsbury in a second revolution following on the Cambridge philosophical one. This time the Bloomsbury painters were much involved and influenced. Fry and other Bloomsbury artists rejected the traditional distinction between fine and decorative art.

These &quot;Bloomsbury assumptions&quot; are reflected in members&#x27; criticisms of materialistic realism in painting and fiction, influenced above all by Clive Bell&#x27;s &quot;concept of &#x27;Significant Form&#x27;, which separated and elevated the concept of form above content in works of art&quot;: it has been suggested that, with their &quot;focus on form ...Bell&#x27;s ideas have come to stand in for, perhaps too much so, the aesthetic principles of the Bloomsbury Group&quot;.

The establishment&#x27;s hostility to post-impressionism made Bloomsbury controversial, and controversial they have remained. Clive Bell polemicized post-impressionism in his widely read book &quot;Art&quot; (1914), basing his aesthetics partly on Roger Fry&#x27;s art criticism and G. E. Moore&#x27;s moral philosophy; and as the war came he argued that &quot;in these days of storm and darkness, it seemed right that at the shrine of civilization - in Bloomsbury, I mean - the lamp should be tended assiduously&quot;.

=== World War I ===

Old Bloomsbury&#x27;s development was affected, along with much of modernist culture, by the First World War: &quot;the small world of Bloomsbury was later said by some on its outskirts to have been irretrievably shattered&quot;, though in fact its friendships &quot;survived the upheavals and dislocations of war, in many ways were even strengthened by them&quot;. Most but not all of them were conscientious objectors. Politically, the members of Bloomsbury had liberal and socialist leanings.

Though the war dispersed Old Bloomsbury, the individuals continued to develop their careers. E. M. Forster followed his successful novels with &quot;Maurice&quot; which he could not publish because it treated homosexuality untragically. In 1915, Virginia Woolf brought out her first novel, &quot;The Voyage Out&quot;; and in 1917 the Woolfs founded their Hogarth Press, which would publish T. S. Eliot, Katherine Mansfield, and many others including Virginia herself along with the standard English translations of Freud. Then in 1918 Lytton Strachey published his critique of Victorianism in the shape of four ironic biographies in &quot;Eminent Victorians,&quot; which added to the arguments about Bloomsbury that continue to this day, and &quot;brought him the triumph he had always longed for ... The book was a sensation&quot;.

The following year came J. M. Keynes&#x27;s influential attack on the Versailles Peace Treaty: &quot;The Economic Consequences of the Peace&quot; established Maynard as a Neo-Classical economist and political economist of international eminence.

=== Attire ===
Bloomsbury members became known for distinctive garments; Woolf in particular was opposed to conventions surrounding formal attire, such as &quot;dressing for dinner&quot;.

== Later Bloomsbury ==
The 1920s were in a number of ways the blooming of Bloomsbury. Virginia Woolf was writing and publishing her most widely read modernist novels and essays, and E. M. Forster completed &quot;A Passage to India&quot;, a highly regarded novel on British imperialism in India. Forster wrote no more novels but he became one of England&#x27;s most influential essayists. Duncan Grant, and then Vanessa Bell, had single-artist exhibitions. Lytton Strachey wrote his biographies of two queens, &quot;Queen Victoria&quot; (1921) and &quot;Elizabeth and Essex: A Tragic History&quot; (1928). Desmond MacCarthy and Leonard Woolf engaged in friendly rivalry as literary editors, respectively of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; and &quot;The Nation and Athenaeum&quot;, thus fuelling animosities that saw Bloomsbury dominating the cultural scene. Roger Fry wrote and lectured widely on art; meanwhile, Clive Bell applied Bloomsbury values to his book &quot;Civilization&quot; (1928), which Leonard Woolf saw as limited and elitist, describing Bell as a &quot;wonderful organiser of intellectual greyhound racing tracks&quot;.

In the darkening 1930s, Bloomsbury began to die: &quot;Bloomsbury itself was hardly any longer a focus&quot;. A year after publishing a collection of brief lives, &quot;Portraits in Miniature&quot; (1931), Lytton Strachey died; shortly afterwards Carrington shot herself. Roger Fry died in 1934. Vanessa and Clive&#x27;s eldest son, Julian Bell, was killed in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. Virginia Woolf wrote Fry&#x27;s biography, but with the coming of war again her mental instability recurred, and she drowned herself in 1941. In the previous decade she had become one of the century&#x27;s most famous feminist writers with three more novels, and a series of essays including the moving late memoir &quot;A Sketch of the Past&quot;. It was also in the 1930s that Desmond MacCarthy became perhaps the most widely read—and heard—literary critic with his columns in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and his broadcasts for the BBC. John Maynard Keynes&#x27;s &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money&quot; (1936) made him one of the century&#x27;s most influential economists. He died in 1946 after being much involved in monetary negotiations with the United States.

The diversity yet collectivity of Later Bloomsbury&#x27;s ideas and achievements can be summed up in a series of credos that were made in 1938, the year of the Munich Agreement. Virginia Woolf published her radical feminist polemic &quot;Three Guineas&quot; that shocked some of her fellow members, including Keynes who had enjoyed the gentler &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot; (1929). Keynes read his &quot;My Early Beliefs&quot; to The Memoir Club. Clive Bell published an appeasement pamphlet (he later supported the war), and E. M. Forster wrote an early version of his famous essay &quot;What I Believe&quot; with its choice of personal relations over patriotism: his quiet assertion in the face of the increasingly totalitarian claims of both left and right that &quot;personal relations ... love and loyalty to an individual can run counter to the claims of the State&quot;.

== Memoir Club ==

In March 1920 Molly MacCarthy began the Memoir Club to help Desmond and herself write their memoirs; and also &quot;for their friends to regroup after the war (with the proviso that they should always tell the truth)&quot;. It met until 1956 or 1964. The club was made up of members of the Bloomsbury Group, a loose collective of artists, writers, intellectuals, and philosophers. Some of the core members of the Bloomsbury Group included Virginia Woolf, Leonard Woolf, Vanessa Bell, Clive Bell, John Maynard Keynes, Roger Fry, E.M. Forster, Lytton Strachey, Sir Desmond MacCarthy, and Duncan Grant. 

==Criticism==
Early complaints focused on a perceived cliquiness: &quot;on personal mannerisms—the favourite phrases (&#x27;ex-quisitely civilized&#x27;, and &#x27;How &quot;simply too&quot; extraordinary!&#x27;), the incredulous, weirdly emphasised Strachey voice&quot;. After World War I, as the members of the Group &quot;began to be famous, the execration increased, and the caricature of an idle, snobbish and self-congratulatory rentier class, promoting its own brand of high culture began to take shape&quot;: as Forster self-mockingly put it, &quot;In came the nice fat dividends, up rose the lofty thoughts&quot;.

The growing threats of the 1930s brought new criticism from younger writers of &quot;what the last lot had done (Bloomsbury, Modernism, Eliot) in favour of what they thought of as urgent hard-hitting realism&quot;; while &quot;Wyndham Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Apes of God&quot;, which called Bloomsbury élitist, corrupt and talentless, caused a stir&quot; of its own. The most telling criticism, however, came perhaps from within the Group&#x27;s own ranks, when on the eve of war Keynes gave a &quot;nostalgic and disillusioned account of the pure sweet air of G. E. Moore, that belief in undisturbed individualism, that Utopianism based on a belief in human reasonableness and decency, that refusal to accept the idea of civilisation as &#x27;a thin and precarious crust&#x27; ... Keynes&#x27;s fond, elegiac repudiation of his &quot;early beliefs&quot;, in the light of current affairs (&quot;We completely misunderstood human nature, including our own&quot;)&quot;.

In his book on the background of the Cambridge spies, Andrew Sinclair wrote about the Bloomsbury group: &quot;rarely in the field of human endeavour has so much been written about so few who achieved so little&quot;. American philosopher Martha Nussbaum was quoted in 1999 as saying &quot;I don&#x27;t like anything that sets itself up as an in-group or an elite, whether it is the Bloomsbury group or Derrida&quot;.

Raymond Williams saw Bloomsbury as the invention of an ageing and lonely Leonard Woolf, seeking to lift himself and his friends from obscurity. To Williams, the only two so-called &quot;members&quot; of any significance in their respective fields were Keynes and Virginia Woolf. Williams unfavourably compared the Bloomsbury Group to the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and Arts and Crafts movement, finding that the older groups were more radical and consequential.
