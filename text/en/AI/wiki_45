<text>William Jennings Bryan (March 19, 1860 – July 26, 1925) was an American lawyer, orator, and politician. He was a dominant force in the Democratic Party, running three times as the party&#x27;s nominee for President of the United States in the 1896, 1900, and 1908 elections. He served in the House of Representatives from 1891 to 1895 and as the Secretary of State under Woodrow Wilson from 1913 to 1915. Because of his faith in the wisdom of the common people, Bryan was often called &quot;the Great Commoner&quot;, and because of his rhetorical power and early fame as the youngest presidential candidate, &quot;the Boy Orator&quot;.

Born and raised in Illinois, Bryan moved to Nebraska in the 1880s. He won election to the House of Representatives in the 1890 elections, served two terms, and made an unsuccessful run for the Senate in 1894. At the 1896 Democratic National Convention, Bryan delivered his &quot;Cross of Gold&quot; speech, which attacked the gold standard and the eastern moneyed interests and crusaded for inflationary policies built around the expanded coinage of silver coins. In a repudiation of incumbent President Grover Cleveland and his conservative Bourbon Democrats, the Democratic convention nominated Bryan for president, making Bryan the youngest major party presidential nominee in U.S. history. Subsequently, Bryan was also nominated for president by the left-wing Populist Party, and many Populists would eventually follow Bryan into the Democratic Party. In the intensely-fought 1896 presidential election, the Republican nominee, William McKinley, emerged triumphant. At age 36, Bryan remains the youngest person in United States history to receive an electoral vote for president and cumulatively, the most electoral votes without ever being elected president. Bryan gained fame as an orator, as he invented the national stumping tour when he reached an audience of 5 million people in 27 states in 1896, and continued to deliver well-attended lectures on the Chautauqua circuit well into the 20th century.

Bryan retained control of the Democratic Party and again won the nomination for the 1900 presidential election. After serving as a colonel in the 3rd Nebraska Infantry Regiment during the Spanish–American War, Bryan became a fierce opponent of American imperialism, and much of his campaign centered on that issue. In the election, McKinley again defeated Bryan and won several Western states that Bryan had won in 1896. Bryan&#x27;s influence in the party weakened after the 1900 election, and the Democrats nominated the conservative Alton B. Parker in the 1904 presidential election. Bryan regained his stature in the party after Parker&#x27;s resounding defeat by Theodore Roosevelt and voters from both parties increasingly embraced some of the progressive reforms that had long been championed by Bryan. Bryan won his party&#x27;s nomination in the 1908 presidential election but was defeated by Roosevelt&#x27;s chosen successor, William Howard Taft. Along with Henry Clay, Bryan is one of the two individuals who never won a presidential election despite receiving electoral votes in three separate presidential elections held after the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment.

After the Democrats won the 1912 presidential election, Wilson rewarded Bryan&#x27;s support with the important cabinet position of Secretary of State. Bryan helped Wilson pass several progressive reforms through Congress. In 1915, he considered that Wilson was too harsh on Germany and finally resigned after Wilson had sent Germany a note of protest with a veiled threat of war in response to the sinking of the by a German U-boat. After leaving office, Bryan retained some of his influence within the Democratic Party but increasingly devoted himself to Prohibition, religious matters, and anti-evolution activism. He opposed Darwinism on religious and humanitarian grounds, most famously as a prosecutor in the 1925 Scopes trial, dying soon after. Bryan has elicited mixed reactions from various commentators but is acknowledged by historians as one of the most influential figures of the Progressive Era.

==Early life and education==
William Jennings Bryan was born in Salem, Illinois, on March 19, 1860, to Silas Lillard Bryan and Mariah Elizabeth (Jennings) Bryan. Silas Bryan had been born in 1822 and had established a legal practice in Salem in 1851. He married Mariah, a former student of his at McKendree College, in 1852. Of Scots-Irish and English ancestry, Silas Bryan was an avid Jacksonian Democrat and an admirer of Andrew Jackson and Stephen A. Douglas, who would pass on his Democratic affiliation to his son, William. Silas Bryan won election as a state circuit judge and in 1866 moved his family to a farm north of Salem. He lived in a ten-room house that was the envy of Marion County. Silas served in various local positions and sought election to Congress in 1872, but was narrowly defeated by the Republican candidate. William&#x27;s cousin, William Sherman Jennings, was also a prominent Democrat.

William was the fourth child of Silas and Mariah, but all three of his older siblings died during infancy. He also had five younger siblings, four of whom lived to adulthood. William was home-schooled by his mother until the age of ten. Demonstrating a precocious talent for oratory, he gave public speeches as early as the age of four. Silas was a Baptist and Mariah was a Methodist, but William&#x27;s parents allowed him to choose his own church. At age fourteen, he had a conversion experience at a revival. He said that it was the most important day of his life. At 15, he was sent to attend Whipple Academy, a private school in Jacksonville, Illinois.
After graduating from Whipple Academy, Bryan entered Illinois College, which was also located in Jacksonville. During his time at Illinois College, Bryan served as chaplain of the Sigma Pi literary society. He also continued to hone his public speaking skills, taking part in numerous debates and oratorical contests. Bryan graduated from Illinois College in 1881 at the top of his class. In 1879, while still in college, Bryan met Mary Elizabeth Baird, the daughter of an owner of a nearby general store, and began courting her. Bryan and Mary Elizabeth married on October 1, 1884. Mary Elizabeth would emerge as an important part of Bryan&#x27;s career by managing his correspondence and helping him prepare speeches and articles.

Bryan then studied law in Chicago at Union Law College (now Northwestern University School of Law). While attending law school, Bryan worked for the attorney Lyman Trumbull, a former senator and friend of Silas Bryan who would serve as an important political ally to the younger Bryan until his death in 1896. Bryan graduated from law school in 1883 with a Bachelor of Laws and returned to Jacksonville to take a position with a local law firm. Frustrated by the lack of political and economic opportunities in Jacksonville, Bryan and his wife moved west to Lincoln in 1887, the capital of the fast-growing state of Nebraska.

==Early political career==
===U. S. Representative and Senate campaign===
Bryan established a successful legal practice in Lincoln with partner Adolphus Talbot, a Republican whom Bryan had known in law school. Bryan also entered local politics by campaigning for Democrats like Julius Sterling Morton and Grover Cleveland. After earning notoriety for his effective speeches in 1888, Bryan ran for Congress in the 1890 election. Bryan called for a reduction in tariff rates, the coinage of silver at a ratio equal to that of gold and action to stem the power of trusts. In part because of a series of strong debate performances, Bryan defeated incumbent Republican William James Connell, who had campaigned on the orthodox Republican platform, centered around the protective tariff. Bryan&#x27;s victory made him only the second Democrat who ever represented Nebraska in Congress. Nationwide, Democrats picked up 76 seats in the House and so obtained a majority in that chamber. The Populist Party, a third party that drew support from agrarian voters in the West, also won several seats in Congress.

With the help of Representative William McKendree Springer, Bryan secured a coveted spot on the House Ways and Means Committee. He quickly earned a reputation as a talented orator and set out to gain a strong understanding of the key economic issues of the day. During the Gilded Age, the Democratic Party had begun to separate into two groups. The conservative northern &quot;Bourbon Democrats&quot;, along with some allies in the South, sought to limit the size and power of the federal government. Another group of Democrats, drawing its membership largely from the agrarian movements of the South and West, favored greater federal intervention to help farmers, regulate railroads, and limit the power of large corporations. Bryan became affiliated with the latter group and advocated for the free coinage of silver (&quot;free silver&quot;) and the establishment of a progressive federal income tax. That endeared him to many reformers, but Bryan&#x27;s call for free silver cost him the support of Morton and some other conservative Nebraska Democrats. Free silver advocates were opposed by banks and bondholders who feared the effects of inflation.

Bryan sought re-election in 1892 to his house seat with the support of many Populists and backed the Populist presidential candidate James B. Weaver over the Democratic presidential candidate, Grover Cleveland. Bryan won re-election by just 140 votes, and Cleveland defeated Weaver and incumbent Republican President Benjamin Harrison in the 1892 presidential election. Cleveland appointed a cabinet consisting largely of conservative Democrats like Morton, who became Cleveland&#x27;s secretary of agriculture. Shortly after Cleveland had taken office, a series of bank closures brought on the Panic of 1893, a major economic crisis. In response, Cleveland called a special session of Congress to call for the repeal of the 1890 Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which required the federal government to purchase several million ounces of silver every month. Bryan mounted a campaign to save the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, but a coalition of Republicans and Democrats successfully repealed it. Bryan, however, was successful in passing an amendment that provided for the establishment of the first peacetime federal income tax.

As the economy declined after 1893, the reforms favored by Bryan and the Populists became more popular among many voters. Rather than running for re-election in 1894, Bryan sought election to the United States Senate. He also became the editor-in-chief of the &quot;Omaha World-Herald&quot; although most editorial duties were performed by Richard Lee Metcalfe and Gilbert Hitchcock. Nationwide, the Republican Party won a huge victory in the elections of 1894 by gaining over 120 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. In Nebraska, despite Bryan&#x27;s popularity, the Republicans elected a majority of the state legislators, and Bryan lost the Senate election to Republican John Mellen Thurston. Bryan, nonetheless, was pleased with the result of the 1894 election, as the Cleveland wing of the Democratic Party had been discredited, and Bryan&#x27;s preferred gubernatorial candidate, Silas A. Holcomb, had been elected by a coalition of Democrats and Populists.

After the 1894 elections, Bryan embarked on a nationwide speaking tour designed to boost free silver, move his party away from the conservative policies of the Cleveland administration, lure Populists and free silver Republicans into the Democratic Party, and raise Bryan&#x27;s public profile before the next election. Speaking fees allowed Bryan to give up his legal practice and devote himself full-time to oratory.

==Presidential candidate and party leader==
===Presidential election of 1896===
====Democratic nomination====
By 1896, free silver forces were ascendant within the party. Though many Democratic leaders were not as enthusiastic about free silver as Bryan was, most recognized the need to distance the party from the unpopular policies of the Cleveland administration. By the start of the 1896 Democratic National Convention, Representative Richard P. Bland, a long-time champion of free silver, was widely perceived to be the frontrunner for the party&#x27;s presidential nomination. Bryan hoped to offer himself as a presidential candidate, but his youth and relative inexperience gave him a lower profile than veteran Democrats like Bland, Governor Horace Boies of Iowa, and Vice President Adlai Stevenson. The free silver forces quickly established dominance over the convention, and Bryan helped draft a party platform that repudiated Cleveland, attacked the conservative rulings of the Supreme Court, and called the gold standard &quot;not only un-American but anti-American&quot;.

Conservative Democrats demanded a debate on the party platform, and on the third day of the convention, each side put forth speakers to debate free silver and the gold standard. Bryan and Senator Benjamin Tillman of South Carolina were chosen as the speakers who would advocate for free silver, but Tillman&#x27;s speech was poorly received by delegates from outside the South because of its sectionalism and references to the Civil War. Charged with delivering the convention&#x27;s last speech on the topic of monetary policy, Bryan seized his opportunity to emerge as the nation&#x27;s leading Democrat. In his &quot;Cross of Gold&quot; speech, Bryan argued that the debate over monetary policy was part of a broader struggle for democracy, political independence and the welfare of the &quot;common man&quot;. Bryan&#x27;s speech was met with rapturous applause and a celebration on the floor of the convention that lasted for over half an hour.
The next day, the Democratic Party held its presidential ballot. With the continuing support of Governor John Altgeld of Illinois, Bland led the first ballot of the convention, but he fell far short of the necessary two-thirds vote. Bryan finished in a distant second on the convention&#x27;s first ballot, but his Cross of Gold speech had left a strong impression on many delegates. Despite the distrust of party leaders like Altgeld, who was wary of supporting an untested candidate, Bryan&#x27;s strength grew over the next four ballots. He gained the lead on the fourth ballot and won his party&#x27;s presidential nomination on the fifth ballot. At the age of 36, Bryan became the youngest presidential nominee of a major party in American history, a position that he still holds. The convention nominated Arthur Sewall, a wealthy Maine shipbuilder who also favored free silver and the income tax, as Bryan&#x27;s running mate.

====General election====
Conservative Democrats, known as the &quot;Gold Democrats&quot;, nominated a separate ticket. Cleveland himself did not publicly attack Bryan but privately favored the Republican candidate, William McKinley, over Bryan. Many urban newspapers in the Northeast and Midwest that had supported previous Democratic tickets also opposed Bryan&#x27;s candidacy. Bryan, however, won the support of the Populist Party, which nominated a ticket consisting of Bryan and Thomas E. Watson of Georgia. Though Populist leaders feared that the nomination of the Democratic candidate would damage the party in the long term, they shared many of Bryan&#x27;s political views and had developed a productive working relationship with Bryan.

The Republican campaign painted McKinley as the &quot;advance agent of prosperity&quot; and social harmony and warned of the supposed dangers of electing Bryan. McKinley and his campaign manager, Mark Hanna, knew that McKinley could not match Bryan&#x27;s oratorical skills. Rather than giving speeches on the campaign trail, the Republican nominee conducted a front porch campaign. Hanna, meanwhile, raised an unprecedented amount of money, dispatched campaign surrogates and organized the distribution of millions of pieces of campaign literature.

Facing a huge campaign finance disadvantage, the Democratic campaign relied largely on Bryan&#x27;s oratorical skills. Breaking with the precedent set by most major party nominees, Bryan gave some 600 speeches, primarily in the hotly-contested Midwest. Bryan invented the national stumping tour, reaching an audience of 5 million in 27 states. He was building a coalition of the white South, poor northern farmers and industrial workers and silver miners against banks and railroads and the &quot;money power&quot;. Free silver appealed to farmers, who would be paid more for their products, but not to industrial workers, who would not get higher wages but would pay higher prices. The industrial cities voted for McKinley, who won nearly the entire East and industrial Midwest and did well along the border and the West Coast. Bryan swept the South and Mountain states and the wheat growing regions of the Midwest. Revivalistic Protestants cheered at Bryan&#x27;s semi-religious rhetoric. Ethnic voters supported McKinley, who promised they would not be excluded from the new prosperity, as did more prosperous farmers and the fast-growing middle class.

McKinley won the election by a fairly comfortable margin by taking 51 percent of the popular vote and 271 electoral votes. Democrats remained loyal to their champion after his defeat; many letters urged him to run again in the 1900 presidential election. William&#x27;s younger brother, Charles W. Bryan, created a card file of supporters to whom the Bryans would send regular mailings to for the next thirty years. The Populist Party fractured after the election; many Populists, including James Weaver, followed Bryan into the Democratic Party, and others followed Eugene V. Debs into the Socialist Party.

===War and peace: 1898–1900===
====Spanish–American War====

Because of better economic conditions for farmers and the effects of the Klondike Gold Rush in raising prices, free silver lost its potency as an electoral issue in the years after 1896. In 1900, President McKinley signed the Gold Standard Act, which put the United States on the gold standard. Bryan remained popular in the Democratic Party and his supporters took control of party organizations throughout the country, but he initially resisted shifting his political focus from free silver. Foreign policy emerged as an important issue due to the ongoing Cuban War of Independence against Spain, as Bryan and many Americans supported Cuban independence. After the explosion of the USS &quot;Maine&quot; in Havana Harbor, the United States declared war on Spain in April 1898, which began the Spanish–American War. Though wary of militarism, Bryan had long favored Cuban independence and so supported the war. He argued that &quot;universal peace cannot come until justice is enthroned throughout the world. Until the right has triumphed in every land and love reigns in every heart, government must, as a last resort, appeal to force&quot;.

At Governor Silas A. Holcomb&#x27;s request, Bryan recruited a 2000-man regiment for the Nebraska National Guard and the soldiers of the regiment elected Bryan as their leader. Under Colonel Bryan&#x27;s command, the regiment was transported to Camp Cuba Libre in Florida, but the fighting between Spain and the United States ended before the regiment had been deployed to Cuba. Bryan&#x27;s regiment remained in Florida for months after the end of the war, which prevented Bryan from taking an active role in the 1898 midterm elections. Bryan resigned his commission and left Florida in December 1898 after the United States and Spain had signed the Treaty of Paris.

Bryan had supported the war to gain Cuba&#x27;s independence, but he was outraged that the Treaty of Paris granted the United States control over the Philippines. Many Republicans believed that the United States had an obligation to &quot;civilize&quot; the Philippines, but Bryan strongly opposed what he saw as American imperialism. Despite his opposition to the annexation of the Philippines, Bryan urged his supporters to ratify the Treaty of Paris. He wanted to quickly bring an official end to the war and then to grant independence to the Philippines as soon as possible. With Bryan&#x27;s support, the treaty was ratified in a close vote, bringing an official end to the Spanish–American War. In early 1899, the Philippine–American War broke out as the established Philippine government, under the leadership of Emilio Aguinaldo, sought to stop the American invasion of the archipelago.

====Presidential election of 1900====
The 1900 Democratic National Convention met in Kansas City, Missouri, where some Democratic leaders opposed to Bryan had hoped to nominate Admiral George Dewey for president. Nevertheless, Bryan faced no significant opposition by the time of the convention and he won his party&#x27;s nomination unanimously. Bryan did not attend the convention but exercised control of the convention&#x27;s proceedings via telegraph. Bryan faced a decision regarding which issue his campaign would focus on. Many of his most fervent supporters wanted Bryan to continue his crusade for free silver, and Democrats from the Northeast advised Bryan to center his campaign on the growing power of trusts. Bryan, however, decided that his campaign would focus on anti-imperialism, partly to unite the factions of the party and win over some Republicans. The party platform contained planks supporting free silver and opposing the power of trusts, but imperialism was labeled as the &quot;paramount issue&quot; of the campaign. The party nominated former Vice President Adlai Stevenson to serve as Bryan&#x27;s running mate.

In his speech accepting the Democratic nomination, Bryan argued that the election represented &quot;a contest between democracy and plutocracy&quot;. He also strongly criticized the U.S. annexation of the Philippines and compared it to Britain&#x27;s past rule over the Thirteen Colonies. Bryan argued that the United States should refrain from imperialism and should seek to become the &quot;supreme moral factor in the world&#x27;s progress and the accepted arbiter of the world&#x27;s disputes&quot;. By 1900, the American Anti-Imperialist League, which included individuals like Benjamin Harrison, Andrew Carnegie, Carl Schurz and Mark Twain, had emerged as the primary domestic organization opposed to the continued American control of the Philippines. Many of the leaders of the League had opposed Bryan in 1896 and continued to distrust Bryan and his followers. Despite the distrust, Bryan&#x27;s strong stance against imperialism convinced most of the league&#x27;s leadership to throw their support behind the Democratic nominee.
Once again, the McKinley campaign established a massive financial advantage, and the Democratic campaign relied largely on Bryan&#x27;s oratory. In a typical day Bryan gave four hour-long speeches and shorter talks that added up to six hours of speaking. At an average rate of 175 words a minute, he turned out 63,000 words a day, enough to fill 52 columns of a newspaper. The Republican Party&#x27;s superior organization and finances boosted McKinley&#x27;s candidacy and, as in the previous campaign, most major newspapers favored McKinley. Bryan also had to contend with the Republican vice presidential nominee, Theodore Roosevelt, who had emerged a national celebrity in the Spanish–American War and proved to be a strong public speaker. Bryan&#x27;s anti-imperialism failed to register with many voters and as the campaign neared its end, Bryan increasingly shifted to attacks on corporate power. He once again sought the vote of urban laborers by telling them to vote against the business interests that had &quot;condemn[ed] the boys of this country to perpetual clerkship&quot;.

By election day, few believed that Bryan would win, and McKinley ultimately prevailed once again over Bryan. Compared to the results of the 1896 election, McKinley increased his popular vote margin and picked up several Western states, including Bryan&#x27;s home state of Nebraska. The Republican platform of victory in war and a strong economy proved to be more important to voters than Bryan&#x27;s questioning the morality of annexing the Philippines. The election also confirmed the continuing organizational advantage of the Republican Party outside of the South.

===Between presidential campaigns, 1901–1907===

After the election, Bryan returned to journalism and oratory and frequently appeared on the Chautauqua circuits to give well-attended lectures across the country. In January 1901, Bryan published the first issue of his weekly newspaper, &quot;The Commoner&quot;, which echoed his favorite political and religious themes. Bryan served as the editor and publisher of the newspaper; Charles Bryan, Mary Bryan and Richard Metcalfe also performed editorial duties when Bryan was traveling. &quot;The Commoner&quot; became one of the most widely-read newspapers of its era and boasted 145,000 subscribers approximately five years after its founding. Though the paper&#x27;s subscriber base heavily overlapped with Bryan&#x27;s political base in the Midwest, content from the papers was frequently reprinted by major newspapers in the Northeast. In 1902, Bryan, his wife and his three children moved into Fairview, a mansion located in Lincoln; Bryan referred to the house as the &quot;Monticello of the West&quot;, and frequently invited politicians and diplomats to visit.

Bryan&#x27;s defeat in 1900 cost him his status as the clear leader of the Democratic Party and conservatives such as David B. Hill and Arthur Pue Gorman moved to re-establish their control over the party and return it to the policies of the Cleveland era. Meanwhile, Roosevelt succeeded McKinley as president after the latter&#x27;s assassination in September 1901 at the Pan-American Exposition, in Buffalo, New York. Roosevelt prosecuted antitrust cases and implemented other progressive policies, but Bryan argued that Roosevelt did not fully embrace progressive causes. Bryan called for a package of reforms, including a federal income tax, pure food and drug laws, a ban on corporate financing of campaigns, a constitutional amendment providing for the direct election of senators, local ownership of utilities, and the state adoption of the initiative and the referendum, and provisions for old age. He also criticized Roosevelt&#x27;s foreign policy and attacked Roosevelt&#x27;s decision to invite Booker T. Washington to dine at the White House in 1901.

Before the 1904 Democratic National Convention, Alton B. Parker, a New York and conservative ally of David Hill, was the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination. Conservatives feared that Bryan would join with the publisher William Randolph Hearst to block Parker&#x27;s nomination. Seeking to appease Bryan and other progressives, Hill agreed to a party platform that omitted mention of the gold standard and criticized trusts. In the event, Bryan did not support Parker or Hearst, but rather Francis Cockrell, a Missouri senator whose career had been almost wholly unremarkable. Bryan&#x27;s motivation was not any belief that Cockrell could defeat Roosevelt in the election, but rather that he would lose decisively, thus paving the way for Bryan to be re-nominated in 1908. However, the possibility of Hearst getting the nomination alarmed the party&#x27;s moderates enough that they moved to support Parker, who was narrowly nominated on the first ballot at the convention, with Cockrell finishing a distant third place. Bryan would nonetheless get his desired outcome when Roosevelt won by the biggest popular vote margin since James Monroe was re-elected without opposition in 1820. Afterwards, Bryan published a post-election edition of &quot;The Commoner&quot; that advised its readers: &quot;Do not Compromise with Plutocracy&quot;.

Bryan traveled to Europe in 1903, meeting with figures such as Leo Tolstoy, who shared some of Bryan&#x27;s religious and political views. In 1905, Bryan and his family embarked on a trip around the globe and visited eighteen countries in Asia and Europe. Bryan funded the trip with public speaking fees and a travelogue that was published on a weekly basis. Bryan&#x27;s travels abroad were documented in a study called &quot;The Old World and its Ways&quot;, in which he shared his thoughts on different topics such as those related to progressive politics and labor legislation. Bryan was greeted by a large crowd upon his return to the United States in 1906 and was widely seen as the likely 1908 Democratic presidential nominee. Partly due to the efforts of muckraking journalists, voters had become increasingly open to progressive ideas since 1904. President Roosevelt himself had moved to the left, favoring federal regulation of railroad rates and meatpacking plants. However, Bryan continued to favor more far-reaching reforms, including federal regulation of banks and securities, protections for union organizers and federal spending on highway construction and education. Bryan also briefly expressed support for the state and federal ownership of railroads in a manner similar to Germany but backed down from that policy in the face of an intra-party backlash.

===Presidential election of 1908===


Roosevelt, who enjoyed wide popularity among most voters even while he alienated some corporate leaders, anointed Secretary of War William Howard Taft as his successor. Meanwhile, Bryan re-established his control over the Democratic Party and won the endorsement of numerous local and state organizations. Conservative Democrats again sought to prevent Bryan&#x27;s nomination, but were unable to unite around an alternative candidate. Bryan was nominated for president on the first ballot of the 1908 Democratic National Convention. He was joined by John W. Kern, a former state senator from the swing state of Indiana.

Bryan campaigned on a party platform that reflected his long-held beliefs, but the Republican platform also advocated for progressive policies, which left relatively few major differences between the two major parties. One issue that the two parties differed on concerned deposit insurance, as Bryan favored requiring national banks to provide deposit insurance. Bryan largely unified the leaders of his own party and his pro-labor policies won him the first presidential endorsement ever issued by the American Federation of Labor. As in previous campaigns, Bryan embarked on a public speaking tour to boost his candidacy but was later joined on the trail by Taft.

Defying Bryan&#x27;s confidence in his own victory, Taft decisively won the 1908 presidential election. Bryan won just a handful of states outside of the Solid South, as he failed to galvanize the support of urban laborers. Bryan remains the only individual since the Civil War to lose three separate U.S. presidential elections as a major party nominee. Since the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment, Bryan and Henry Clay are the lone individuals who received electoral votes in three separate presidential elections but lost all three elections. The 493 cumulative electoral votes cast for Bryan across three separate elections are the most received by a presidential candidate who was never elected.
Bryan remained an influential figure in Democratic politics, and after Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in the 1910 midterm elections, he appeared in the House of Representatives to argue for tariff reduction. In 1909, Bryan came out publicly for the first time in favor of Prohibition. A lifelong teetotaler, Bryan had refrained from embracing Prohibition earlier because of the issue&#x27;s unpopularity among many Democrats. According to biographer Paolo Colletta, Bryan &quot;sincerely believed that prohibition would contribute to the physical health and moral improvement of the individual, stimulate civic progress and end the notorious abuses connected with the liquor traffic&quot;.

In 1910, he also came out in favor of women&#x27;s suffrage. Bryan crusaded as well for legislation to support the introduction of the initiative and referendum as a means of giving voters a direct voice while he made a whistle-stop campaign tour of Arkansas in 1910. Although some observers, including President Taft, speculated that Bryan would make a fourth run for the presidency, Bryan repeatedly denied that he had any such intention.

==Wilson presidency==
===1912 election===
An escalating split in the Republican Party gave Democrats their best chance in decades to win the presidency. Bryan did not seek the Democratic presidential nomination; his continuing influence gave him a major voice in choosing the nominee. Bryan was intent on preventing the conservatives in the party from nominating their candidate, as they had done in 1904. For a mix of practical and ideological reasons, Bryan ruled out supporting the candidacies of Oscar Underwood, Judson Harmon, and Joseph W. Folk, which left two major candidates competing for his backing: New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson and Speaker of the House Champ Clark. As Speaker, Clark could lay claim to progressive accomplishments, including the passage of constitutional amendments providing for the direct election of senators and the establishment of a federal income tax. However, Clark had alienated Bryan for his failure to lower the tariff and Bryan viewed the Speaker as overly friendly to conservative business interests. Wilson had criticized Bryan but had compiled a strong progressive record as governor. As the 1912 Democratic National Convention approached, Bryan continued to deny that he would seek the presidency, but many journalists and politicians suspected that Bryan hoped a deadlocked convention would turn to him.

After the start of the convention, Bryan engineered the passage of a resolution stating that the party was &quot;opposed to the nomination of any candidate who is a representative of, or under any obligation to, J. Pierpont Morgan, Thomas F. Ryan, August Belmont, or any other member of the privilege-hunting and favor-seeking class&quot;. Clark and Wilson won the support of most delegates on the first several presidential ballots of the Democratic convention, but each fell short of the necessary two-thirds majority. After Tammany Hall came out in favor of Clark and the New York delegation threw its support behind the Speaker, Bryan announced that he would support Wilson. In explaining his decision, Bryan stated that he could &quot;not be a party to the nomination of any man... who will not, when elected, be absolutely free to carry out the anti-Morgan-Ryan-Belmont resolution&quot;. Bryan&#x27;s speech marked the start of a long shift away from Clark: Wilson would finally clinch the presidential nomination after over 40 ballots. Journalists attributed much of the credit for Wilson&#x27;s victory to Bryan.

In the 1912 presidential election, Wilson faced off against President Taft and former President Roosevelt, the latter of whom ran on the Progressive Party ticket. Bryan campaigned throughout the West for Wilson and also offered advice to the Democratic nominee on various issues. The split in the Republican ranks helped give Wilson the presidency; he won over 400 electoral votes but only 41.8 percent of the popular vote. In the concurrent congressional elections, Democrats expanded their majority in the House and gained control of the Senate, which gave the party unified control of Congress and the presidency for the first time since the early 1890s.

===Secretary of State===

President Wilson named Bryan as Secretary of State, the most prestigious appointive position. Bryan&#x27;s extensive travels, popularity in the party, and support for Wilson in the election made him the obvious choice. Bryan took charge of a State Department that employed 150 officials in Washington and an additional 400 employees in embassies abroad. Early in Wilson&#x27;s tenure, the president and the secretary of state broadly agreed on foreign policy goals, including the rejection of Taft&#x27;s Dollar diplomacy. They also shared many priorities in domestic affairs and, with Bryan&#x27;s help, Wilson orchestrated passage of laws that reduced tariff rates, imposed a progressive income tax, introduced new antitrust measures, and established the Federal Reserve System. Bryan proved particularly influential in ensuring that the president, rather than private bankers, was empowered to appoint the members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.

Secretary of State Bryan pursued a series of bilateral treaties that required both signatories to submit all disputes to an investigative tribunal. He quickly won approval from the president and the Senate to proceed with his initiative. In mid-1913, El Salvador became the first nation to sign one of Bryan&#x27;s treaties, and 29 other countries, including every great power in Europe other than Germany and Austria-Hungary, also agreed to sign the treaties. Despite Bryan&#x27;s stated aversion to conflict, he oversaw U.S. military interventions in Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Mexico as part of the Banana Wars.

After World War I broke out in Europe, Bryan consistently advocated for American neutrality between the Entente and the Central Powers. With Bryan&#x27;s support, Wilson initially sought to stay out of the conflict, urging Americans to be &quot;impartial in thought as well as action&quot;. For much of 1914, Bryan attempted to bring a negotiated end to the war, but the leaders of both the Entente and the Central Powers were ultimately uninterested in American mediation. Bryan remained firmly committed to neutrality, but Wilson and others within the administration became increasingly sympathetic to the Entente.

The March 1915 Thrasher incident, in which a German U-boat sank the British steamship &quot;Falaba&quot; with a U.S. citizen on board, provided a major blow to the cause of American neutrality. The May 1915 sinking of RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; by another German U-boat further galvanized anti-German sentiment in the United States, as 128 Americans died in the incident. In response, Bryan argued that the Allied blockade of Germany was as offensive as the German U-boat Campaign, and maintained that by traveling on British vessels &quot;an American citizen can, by putting his own business above his regard for this country, assume for his own advantage unnecessary risks and thus involve his country in international complications&quot;. After Wilson sent an official message of protest to Germany and refused to warn Americans publicly not to travel on British ships, Bryan delivered his letter of resignation to Wilson on June 8, 1915.

==Later career==
===Political involvement===
During the 1916 presidential election, members of the Prohibition Party attempted to place Bryan into consideration for its presidential nomination, but he rejected the offer via telegram.

Bryan supported Wilson&#x27;s 1916 re-election campaign. Bryan did not attend as an official delegate, but the 1916 Democratic National Convention suspended its own rules to allow Bryan to address the convention; Bryan delivered a well-received speech that strongly defended Wilson&#x27;s domestic record. Bryan served as a campaign surrogate for Wilson by delivering dozens of speeches, primarily to audiences west of the Mississippi River. Ultimately, Wilson narrowly prevailed over the Republican candidate, Charles Evans Hughes. When the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Bryan wrote to Wilson: &quot;Believing it to be the duty of the citizen to bear his part of the burden of war and his share of the peril, I hereby tender my services to the Government. Please enroll me as a private whenever I am needed and assign me to any work that I can do.&quot; Wilson declined to appoint Bryan to a federal position, but Bryan agreed to Wilson&#x27;s request to provide public support for the war effort through his speeches and articles. After the war, despite some reservations, Bryan supported Wilson&#x27;s unsuccessful effort to bring the United States into the League of Nations.

===Crusade for Prohibition===
After leaving office, Bryan spent much of his time advocating for the eight-hour day, a minimum wage, the right of unions to strike and increasingly women&#x27;s suffrage. However, his main crusades focused on support for prohibition and opposition to the teaching of evolution. Congress passed the Eighteenth Amendment, which provided for nationwide Prohibition, in 1917. Two years later, Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women the right to vote nationwide. Both amendments were ratified in 1920. In 1916 Bryan expressed his belief to John Reed that the government &quot;may properly impose a minimum wage, regulate hours of labor, pass usury laws, and enforce inspection of food, sanitation and housing conditions.&quot; During the 1920s, Bryan called for further reforms, including agricultural subsidies, the guarantee of a living wage, full public financing of political campaigns and an end to legal gender discrimination.

Some Prohibitionists and other Bryan supporters tried to convince the three-time presidential candidate to enter the 1920 presidential election, and a &quot;Literary Digest&quot; poll taken in mid-1920 ranked Bryan as the fourth-most popular potential Democratic candidate. Bryan, however, declined to seek public office and wrote, &quot;if I can help this world to banish alcohol and after that to banish war... no office, no Presidency, can offer the honors that will be mine&quot;. He attended the 1920 Democratic National Convention as a delegate from Nebraska but was disappointed by the nomination of Governor James M. Cox, who had not supported ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment. Bryan declined the presidential nomination of the Prohibition Party and refused to campaign for Cox, which made the 1920 campaign the first presidential contest in over thirty years in which he did not actively campaign.

Though he became less involved in Democratic politics after 1920, Bryan attended the 1924 Democratic National Convention as a delegate from Florida. He helped defeat a resolution condemning the Ku Klux Klan because he expected that the organization would soon fold. Bryan disliked the Klan but never publicly attacked it. He also strongly opposed the candidacy of Al Smith due to Smith&#x27;s hostility towards Prohibition. After over 100 ballots, the Democratic convention nominated John W. Davis, a conservative Wall Street lawyer. To balance the conservative Davis with a progressive, the convention nominated Bryan&#x27;s brother, Charles W. Bryan, for vice president. Bryan was disappointed by the nomination of Davis but strongly approved of the nomination of his brother and he delivered numerous campaign speeches in support of the Democratic ticket. Davis suffered one of the worst losses in the Democratic Party&#x27;s history, taking just 29 percent of the vote against Republican President Calvin Coolidge and the third-party candidate Robert M. La Follette.
===Florida real estate promoter===

To help Mary cope with her worsening health during the harsh winters of Nebraska, the Bryans bought a farm in Mission, Texas, in 1909. Due to Mary&#x27;s arthritis the Bryans in 1912 began to build a new home in Miami, Florida, known as Villa Serena. The Bryans made Villa Serena their permanent home, and Charles Bryan continued to oversee &quot;The Commoner&quot; from Lincoln. The Bryans were active citizens in Miami, leading a fundraising drive for the YMCA and frequently hosting the public at their home. Bryan undertook lucrative speaking engagements, often serving as a spokesman for George E. Merrick&#x27;s new planned community of Coral Gables.

===Trustee of American University===
Bryan served as a member of the board of trustees at American University in Washington, D.C., from 1914 to his death. For some of these years, he served concurrently with Warren G. Harding and Theodore Roosevelt.

===Anti-evolution activism===
In the 1920s, Bryan shifted his focus away from politics, becoming one of the most prominent religious figures in the country. He held a weekly Bible class in Miami and published several religiously themed books. He was one of the first individuals to preach religious faith on the radio, which let him reach audiences across the country. Bryan welcomed the proliferation of faiths other than Protestant Christianity, but he was deeply concerned by the rejection of Biblical literalism by many Protestants. According to the historian Ronald L. Numbers, Bryan was not nearly as much a fundamentalist as many modern-day creationists of the 21st century. Instead, he is more accurately described as a &quot;day-age creationist&quot;. Bradley J. Longfield posits Bryan was a &quot;theologically conservative Social Gospeler&quot;.

In the final years of his life, Bryan became the unofficial leader of a movement that sought to prevent public schools from teaching Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution. Bryan had long expressed skepticism and concern regarding Darwin&#x27;s theory; in his famous 1909 Chautauqua lecture, &quot;The Prince of Peace&quot;, Bryan had warned that the theory of evolution could undermine the foundations of morality. Bryan opposed Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution through natural selection for two reasons. He believed what he considered a materialistic account of the descent of man (and all life) through evolution to be directly contrary to the Biblical creation account. Also, he considered Darwinism as applied to society (social Darwinism) to be a great evil force in the world by promoting hatred and conflicts and inhibiting upward social and economic mobility of the poor and oppressed.

As part of his crusade against Darwinism, Bryan called for state and local laws banning public schools from teaching evolution. He requested that lawmakers refrain from attaching a criminal penalty to the anti-evolution laws and also urged that educators be allowed to teach evolution as a &quot;hypothesis&quot;, rather than as a fact. Only five southern states responded to Bryan&#x27;s call to bar the teaching of evolution in public schools.

Bryan was worried that the theory of evolution was gaining ground not only in the universities, but also within the church. The developments of 19th century liberal theology, specifically higher criticism, had allowed many clergymen to be willing to embrace the theory of evolution and claim that it was not contradictory to Christianity. Determined to put an end to this, Bryan, who had long served as a Presbyterian elder, decided to run for the position of Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, which was at the time embroiled in the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy. Bryan&#x27;s main competition in the race was the Rev. Charles F. Wishart, president of the College of Wooster in Ohio, who had loudly endorsed the teaching of the theory of evolution in the college. Bryan lost to Wishart by a vote of 451–427. Bryan failed in gaining approval for a proposal to cut off funds to schools in which the theory of evolution was taught.

====Scopes Trial====
From July 10 to 21, 1925, Bryan participated in the highly publicized Scopes Trial. The defendant, John T. Scopes, had violated the Butler Act, a Tennessee law barring the teaching of evolution in public schools, while serving as a substitute biology teacher in Dayton, Tennessee. His defense was funded by the American Civil Liberties Union and led in court by the famed lawyer Clarence Darrow. No one disputed that Scopes had violated the Butler Act, but Darrow argued that the statute violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Bryan defended the right of parents to choose what schools teach, argued that Darwinism was merely a &quot;hypothesis&quot;, and claimed that Darrow and other intellectuals were trying to invalidate &quot;every moral standard that the Bible gives us&quot;. The defense called Bryan as a witness and asked him about his belief in the literal word of the Bible, though the judge later expunged Bryan&#x27;s testimony.

Ultimately, the judge instructed the jury to render a verdict of guilty, and Scopes was fined $100 for violating the Butler Act. The national media reported the trial in great detail, with H. L. Mencken ridiculing Bryan as a symbol of Southern ignorance and anti-intellectualism. Even many Southern newspapers criticized Bryan&#x27;s performance in the trial; the &quot;Memphis Commercial Appeal&quot; reported that &quot;Darrow succeeded in showing that Bryan knows little about the science of the world&quot;. Bryan had been prevented from delivering a final argument at trial, but he arranged for the publication of the speech he had intended to give. In that publication, Bryan wrote that &quot;science is a magnificent material force, but it is not a teacher of morals&quot;.

==Death==
In the days after the Scopes Trial, Bryan delivered several speeches in Tennessee. On Sunday, July 26, 1925, Bryan died in his sleep from apoplexy after he had attended a church service in Dayton. Bryan&#x27;s body was transported by rail from Dayton to Washington, D.C. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, with an epitaph that read, &quot;Statesman, yet Friend to Truth! Of Soul Sincere, in Action Faithful, and in Honor Clear&quot; and on the other side &quot;He Kept the Faith&quot;.

==Family==
Bryan remained married to his wife, Mary, until his death in 1925. Mary served as a very important adviser to her husband; she passed the bar exam and learned German to help his career. She was buried next to Bryan after her death in 1930. William and Mary had three children: Ruth (1886–1954), William Jr. (1889–1978), and Grace Dexter (1891–1945). Ruth won election to Congress from Florida in 1928 and later served as ambassador to Denmark during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt. William Jr. graduated from Georgetown Law, established a legal practice in Los Angeles, later held several federal positions, and became an important figure in the Los Angeles Democratic Party. Grace also moved to Southern California and wrote a biography of her father. William Sr.&#x27;s brother, Charles, was an important supporter of his brother until William&#x27;s death, as well as an influential politician in his own right. Charles served two terms as the mayor of Lincoln and three terms as the governor of Nebraska and was the Democratic vice presidential nominee in the 1924 presidential election.
==Legacy==
===Historical reputation and political legacy===

Bryan elicited mixed views during his lifetime and his legacy remains complicated. Author Scott Farris argues that &quot;many fail to understand Bryan because he occupies a rare space in society ... too liberal for today&#x27;s religious [and] too religious for today&#x27;s liberals&quot;. Jeff Taylor rejects the view that Bryan was a &quot;pioneer of the welfare state&quot; and a &quot;forerunner of the New Deal&quot;, but argues that Bryan was more accepting of an interventionist federal government than his Democratic predecessors had been. In terms of his dominant role in the Democratic party between 1896 and 1912, historian David Sarasohn concluded the party became:An issue-oriented party (tariff and child labor reform, trust regulation, federal income tax, direct election of senators) and an emerging national coalition (southerners, western Progressives, blue-collar ethnic voters, and liberal intellectuals), most of whom shared a grudging but genuine admiration for their titular leader, William Jennings Bryan. Indeed, it is the Commoner [Bryan] whose spirit, vision, and yes, political sagacity, pervades the narrative. 

In long-term perspective, biographer Michael Kazin writes:
Kazin argues that, compared to Bryan, &quot;only Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson had a greater impact on politics and political culture during the era of reform that began in the mid-1890s and lasted until the early 1920s&quot;. Richard F. Pettigrew (R-SD) said of Bryan: &quot;Bryan never knowingly served the vested interests. He fought them to the best of his ability.&quot; Writing in 1931, former Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo stated that &quot;with the exception of the men who have occupied the White House, Bryan ... had more to do with the shaping of the public policies of the last forty years than any other American citizen&quot;. Historian Robert D. Johnston notes that Bryan was &quot;arguably [the] most influential politician from the Great Plains&quot;. In 2015, political scientist Michael G. Miller and historian Ken Owen ranked Bryan as one of the four most influential American politicians who never served as president, alongside Alexander Hamilton, Henry Clay, and John C. Calhoun.

Kazin emphasizes the limits of Bryan&#x27;s influence by observing that &quot;for decades after [Bryan]&#x27;s death, influential scholars and journalists depicted him as a self-righteous simpleton who longed to preserve an age that had already passed&quot;. Writing in 2006, editor Richard Lingeman commented that &quot;William Jennings Bryan is mainly remembered as the fanatical old fool Fredric March played in &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;&quot;. Similarly, in 2011, John McDermott wrote that &quot;Bryan is perhaps best known as the sweaty crank of a lawyer who represented Tennessee in the Scopes trial. After his defence of creationism, he became a mocked caricature, a sweaty possessor of avoirdupois, bereft of bombast&quot;. Kazin writes that &quot;scholars have increasingly warmed to Bryan&#x27;s motives, if not his actions&quot; in the Scopes Trial because of Bryan&#x27;s rejection of eugenics, a practice that many evolutionists of the 1920s favored. Kazin also notes the stain that Bryan&#x27;s acceptance of the Jim Crow laws places on his legacy, writing
Prominent individuals from both parties have praised Bryan and his legacy. In 1962, former President Harry Truman said Bryan &quot;was a great one—one of the greatest&quot;. Truman also stated, &quot;If it wasn&#x27;t for old Bill Bryan, there wouldn&#x27;t be any liberalism at all in the country now. Bryan kept liberalism alive, he kept it going.&quot; Tom L. Johnson, the progressive mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, referred to Bryan&#x27;s campaign in 1896 as &quot;the first great struggle of the masses in our country against the privileged classes&quot;. In a 1934 speech dedicating a memorial to Bryan, President Franklin D. Roosevelt said:
Into the 21st century, some conservative Republicans have hailed Bryan&#x27;s legacy from a religious perspective. Ralph Reed described Bryan as &quot;the most consequential evangelical politician of the twentieth century&quot;. Bryan&#x27;s career has also been compared to that of Donald Trump.

===In popular culture===
*It has been argued by economists, historians, and literary critics that L. Frank Baum satirized Bryan as the Cowardly Lion in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, which was published in 1900. Those assertions are based partly on Baum&#x27;s history as a Republican supporter who advocated in his role as a journalist on behalf of William McKinley and his policies. 
*Vachel Lindsay&#x27;s 1919 &quot;singing poem&quot; &quot;Bryan, Bryan, Bryan, Bryan&quot; is a lengthy tribute to the idol of the poet&#x27;s youth.
*Bryan played a minor role in Thomas Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;Look Homeward Angel&quot; (1929). 
*Bryan also has a biographical part in &quot;The 42nd Parallel&quot; (1930) in John Dos Passos&#x27; &quot;USA Trilogy&quot;. 
*Edwin Maxwell played Bryan in the 1944 film &quot;Wilson&quot;. 
*&quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;, a 1955 play by Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee, is a highly fictionalized account of the Scopes Trial written in response to McCarthyism. A populist thrice-defeated presidential candidate from Nebraska named Matthew Harrison Brady (based on Bryan) comes to a small town to help prosecute a young teacher for teaching evolution to his schoolchildren. He is opposed by a famous trial lawyer, Henry Drummond (based on Darrow) and mocked by a cynical newspaperman (based on Mencken) as the trial assumes a national profile. The 1960 film adaptation was directed by Stanley Kramer and starred Fredric March as Brady and Spencer Tracy as Drummond.
*Bryan appears as a character in Douglas Moore&#x27;s 1956 opera &quot;The Ballad of Baby Doe&quot;. 
*Ainslie Pryor played Bryan in a 1956 episode of the CBS anthology series &quot;You Are There&quot;. 
*Bryan also appears in &quot;And Having Writ&quot; (1978) by Donald R. Bensen. 
*Bryan appears in Gore Vidal&#x27;s 1987 novel &quot;Empire&quot;.
*The 1992 short story &quot;Plowshare&quot; by Martha Soukup and part of the 1984 novel &quot;&quot; by Robert A. Heinlein are set in worlds where Bryan became president.
*Bryan is mentioned in the folk song &quot;Blue Water Line&quot; as stoking coal on a restored train.

===Memorials===

The William Jennings Bryan House, in Nebraska, was named a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1963. The Bryan Home Museum is an appointment-only museum at his birthplace in Salem, Illinois. Salem is also home to Bryan Park and a large statue of Bryan. His home at Asheville, North Carolina, from 1917 to 1920, the William Jennings Bryan House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Villa Serena, Bryan&#x27;s property in Miami, Florida, is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered an address on May 3, 1934, dedicating a statue of William Jennings Bryan created by Gutzon Borglum, the sculptor of Mount Rushmore. This Bryan statue by Borglum originally stood in Washington, D.C., but was displaced by highway construction and moved by an Act of Congress in 1961 to Salem, Illinois, Bryan&#x27;s birthplace.

A statue of Bryan represented the state of Nebraska in the National Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol, as part of the National Statuary Hall Collection. In 2019, a statue of Chief Standing Bear replaced the statue of Bryan in the National Statuary Hall.

Bryan was named to the Nebraska Hall of Fame in 1971, and a bust of him resides there, in the Nebraska State Capitol. Bryan was honored by the United States Postal Service with a $2 Great Americans series postage stamp.

Numerous objects, places and people have been named after Bryan, including Bryan County, Oklahoma, Bryan Medical Center in Lincoln, Nebraska, and Bryan College, located in Dayton, Tennessee. Omaha Bryan High School and Bryan Middle School in Bellevue, Nebraska, are also named for Bryan. During World War II the Liberty ship was built in Panama City, Florida, and WJ A Bryan Elementary School in Miami, named in his honor.

<text>Unitatis redintegratio (&quot;Restoration of unity&quot;) is the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s decree on ecumenism. It was passed by a vote of 2,137 to 11 of the bishops assembled at the Council, and was promulgated by Pope Paul VI on 21 November 1964.

The title of the document is taken from the opening words of the Latin text. The opening words of the official English translation are: &quot;The restoration of unity among all Christians is one of the principal concerns of the Second Vatican Council.&quot;

==Description==
&quot;Unitatis Redintegratio&quot; calls for the reunion of Christendom and is similar to a previous call for unity by Pope Leo XIII in his 1894 encyclical letter &quot;Praeclara gratulationis publicae&quot; and by Pope Pius IX in his encyclical &quot;In Suprema Petri Apostoli Sede&quot;. However, &quot;Unitatis&quot; articulates a different kind of ecclesiology from &quot;Praeclara&quot;. It focuses on the unity of the people of God and on separated Christian brethren rather than insisting according to the classical formulation that schismatics must return to the fold under the unity of the Vicar of Christ.

&quot;Unitatis&quot; acknowledges that there are serious problems facing prospects of reunion with Reformation communities that make no attempt to claim apostolic succession as the Anglican communion does. Ecclesial communities which adhere to Calvinism are a particularly challenging case because they and Catholicism have important doctrinal differences on key issues such as ecclesiology, liturgy and mariology. Other communities have insoluble doctrinal differences with Catholic Christianity because their theology of the Holy Trinity is manifestly incompatible with the doctrine as articulated by the council of Nicaea in the early Church.

==Subsequent developments==
Pope John Paul II refers to and builds on the teaching of &quot;Unitatis Redintegratio&quot; in his encyclical letter of 25 May 1995, &quot;Ut unum sint&quot;.

Cardinal Walter Kasper discussed the status of the problems by the document on the 40th anniversary of the promulgation of &quot;Unitatis&quot; in remarks entitled &quot;The Decree on Ecumenism – Read Anew After Forty Years&quot;.

<doc id="40613" wikidata="Q1478762" url="?curid=40613" title="Logic analyzer">
<text>A logic analyzer is an electronic instrument that captures and displays multiple logic signals from a digital system or digital circuit. A logic analyzer may convert the captured data into timing diagrams, protocol decodes, state machine traces, opcodes, or may correlate opcodes with source-level software. Logic analyzers have advanced triggering capabilities, and are useful when a user needs to see the timing relationships between many signals in a digital system.

==Overview==
Presently, there are three distinct categories of logic analyzers available on the market:

* Modular LAs, which consist of both a chassis or mainframe and logic analyzer modules. The mainframe/chassis contains the display, controls, control computer, and multiple slots into which the actual data-capturing hardware is installed. The modules each have a specific number of channels, and multiple modules may be combined to obtain a very high channel count. While modular logic analyzers are typically more expensive, the ability to combine multiple modules to obtain a high channel count and the generally higher performance of modular logic analyzers often justifies the price. For the very high end modular logic analyzers, the user often must provide their own host PC or purchase an embedded controller compatible with the system.

* Portable LAs, sometimes referred to as standalone LAs. Portable logic analyzers integrate everything into a single package, with options installed at the factory. While portable logic analyzers generally have lower performance than their modular counterparts, they are often used for general purpose debugging by cost conscious users.
* PC-based LAs. The hardware connects to a computer through a USB or Ethernet connection and relays the captured signals to the software on the computer. These devices are typically much smaller and less expensive because they make use of a PC&#x27;s existing keyboard, display and CPU.

== Operation ==
A logic analyzer can be triggered on a complicated sequence of digital events, then capture a large amount of digital data from the system under test (SUT).

When logic analyzers first came into use, it was common to attach several hundred &quot;clips&quot; to a digital system. Later, specialized connectors came into use. The evolution of logic analyzer probes has led to a common footprint that multiple vendors support, which provides added freedom to end users. Introduced in April, 2002, connectorless technology (identified by several vendor-specific trade names: Compression Probing; Soft Touch; D-Max) has become popular. These probes provide a durable, reliable mechanical and electrical connection between the probe and the circuit board with less than 0.5 to 0.7 pF loading per signal.

Once the probes are connected, the user programs the analyzer with the names of each signal, and can group several signals together for easier manipulation. Next, a capture mode is chosen, either &quot;timing&quot; mode, where the input signals are sampled at regular intervals based on an internal or external clock source, or &quot;state&quot; mode, where one or more of the signals are defined as &quot;clocks&quot;, and data are taken on the rising or falling edges of these clocks, optionally using other signals to qualify these clocks.

After the mode is chosen, a &quot;trigger condition&quot; must be set. A trigger condition can range from simple (such as triggering on a rising or falling edge of a single signal) to the very complex (such as configuring the analyzer to decode the higher levels of the TCP/IP stack and triggering on a certain HTTP packet).

At this point, the user sets the analyzer to &quot;run&quot; mode, either triggering once, or repeatedly triggering.

Once the data are captured, they can be displayed several ways, from the simple (showing waveforms or state listings) to the complex (showing decoded Ethernet protocol traffic). Some analyzers can also operate in a &quot;compare&quot; mode, where they compare each captured data set to a previously recorded data set, and halt capture or visually notify the operator when this data set is either matched or not. This is useful for long-term empirical testing. Recent analyzers can even be set to email a copy of the test data to the engineer on a successful trigger.

== Uses ==
Many digital designs, including those of ICs, are simulated to detect defects before the unit is constructed. The simulation usually provides logic analysis displays. Often, complex discrete logic is verified by simulating inputs and testing outputs using boundary scan. Logic analyzers can uncover hardware defects that are not found in simulation. These problems are typically too difficult to model in simulation, or too time-consuming to simulate and often cross multiple clock domains.

Field-programmable gate arrays have become a common measurement point for logic analyzers and are also used to debug the logic circuit.

Logic Analyzers are also very useful when it comes to analyze serial protocols, like I2C, SPI or UART, as they allow to capture long logic sequences showing one or several communication frames. Usually, the Logic Analyzer software will also interpret the protocol layer, making debugging of firmware less tedious task.

==History==
As digital computing and integrated circuits emerged in the 1960s, new and difficult problems began to arise, problems that oscilloscopes had trouble handling. For the first time in computing history, it became essential to simultaneously view large numbers of signals. Early solutions attempted to combine hardware from multiple oscilloscopes into one package, but screen clutter, a lack of definite data interpretation, as well as probing constraints made this solution only marginally usable.

The HP 5000A Logic Analyzer, introduced in the October 1973 issue of the &quot;Hewlett-Packard Journal&quot;, was probably the first commercially available instrument to be called a &quot;Logic Analyzer&quot;. However, the HP 5000A was limited to two channels and presented information by means of two rows of 32 LEDs. The first truly parallel instrument was the twelve channel HP 1601L, it was a plug-in for the HP 180 series oscilloscope mainframes and used the oscilloscope screen to present 16 rows of 12 bit words as 1s and 0s. It was introduced in the January 1974 &quot;Hewlett-Packard Journal&quot;.

==Mixed-signal oscilloscopes==
Mixed-signal oscilloscopes combine the functionality of a digital storage oscilloscope with a logic analyzer. The several benefits of these include the ability to view analog and digital signals together in time, and to trigger on either digital or analog signals and capture on the other. A few limitations of mixed signal oscilloscopes are that they do not capture state-mode data, they have a limited channel count, and do not provide the analytical depth and insight of a logic analyzer.

<text>A network switch (also called switching hub, bridging hub, Ethernet switch, and, by the IEEE, MAC bridge) is networking hardware that connects devices on a computer network by using packet switching to receive and forward data to the destination device.

A network switch is a multiport network bridge that uses MAC addresses to forward data at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model. Some switches can also forward data at the network layer (layer 3) by additionally incorporating routing functionality. Such switches are commonly known as layer-3 switches or multilayer switches.

Switches for Ethernet are the most common form of network switch. The first MAC Bridge was invented in 1983 by Mark Kempf, an engineer in the Networking Advanced Development group of Digital Equipment Corporation. The first 2 port Bridge product (LANBridge 100) was introduced by that company shortly after. The company subsequently produced multi-port switches for both Ethernet and FDDI such as GigaSwitch. Digital decided to license its MAC Bridge patent in a royalty-free, non-discriminatory basis that allowed IEEE standardization. This permitted a number of other companies to produce multi-port switches, including Kalpana. Ethernet was initially a shared-access medium, but the introduction of the MAC bridge began its transformation into its most-common point-to-point form without a collision domain. Switches also exist for other types of networks including Fibre Channel, Asynchronous Transfer Mode, and InfiniBand.

Unlike repeater hubs, which broadcast the same data out of each port and let the devices pick out the data addressed to them, a network switch learns the Ethernet addresses of connected devices and then only forwards data to the port connected to the device to which it is addressed.

== Overview ==
A switch is a device in a computer network that connects other devices together. Multiple data cables are plugged into a switch to enable communication between different networked devices. Switches manage the flow of data across a network by transmitting a received network packet only to the one or more devices for which the packet is intended. Each networked device connected to a switch can be identified by its network address, allowing the switch to direct the flow of traffic maximizing the security and efficiency of the network.

A switch is more intelligent than an Ethernet hub, which simply retransmits packets out of every port of the hub except the port on which the packet was received, unable to distinguish different recipients, and achieving an overall lower network efficiency.

An Ethernet switch operates at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model to create a separate collision domain for each switch port. Each device connected to a switch port can transfer data to any of the other ports at any time and the transmissions will not interfere. Because broadcasts are still being forwarded to all connected devices by the switch, the newly formed network segment continues to be a broadcast domain. Switches may also operate at higher layers of the OSI model, including the network layer and above. A switch that also operates at these higher layers is known as a multilayer switch.

Segmentation involves the use of a switch to split a larger collision domain into smaller ones in order to reduce collision probability and to improve overall network throughput. In the extreme case (i.e. micro-segmentation), each device is directly connected to a switch port dedicated to the device. In contrast to an Ethernet hub, there is a separate collision domain on each switch port. This allows computers to have dedicated bandwidth on point-to-point connections to the network and also to run in full-duplex mode. Full-duplex mode has only one transmitter and one receiver per collision domain, making collisions impossible.

The network switch plays an integral role in most modern Ethernet local area networks (LANs). Mid-to-large-sized LANs contain a number of linked managed switches. Small office/home office (SOHO) applications typically use a single switch, or an all-purpose device such as a residential gateway to access small office/home broadband services such as DSL or cable Internet. In most of these cases, the end-user device contains a router and components that interface to the particular physical broadband technology.

Many switches have pluggable modules, such as Small Form-factor Pluggable (SFP) modules. These modules often contain a transceiver that connects the switch to a physical medium, such as a fiber optic cable. These modules were preceded by Medium Attachment Units connected via Attachment Unit Interfaces to switches and have evolved over time: the first modules were Gigabit interface converters, followed by XENPAK modules, SFP modules, XFP transceivers, 
SFP+ modules, QSFP, QSFP-DD, and OSFP modules. Pluggable modules are also used for transmitting video in broadcast applications.

== Role in a network ==
Switches are most commonly used as the network connection point for hosts at the edge of a network. In the hierarchical internetworking model and similar network architectures, switches are also used deeper in the network to provide connections between the switches at the edge.

In switches intended for commercial use, built-in or modular interfaces make it possible to connect different types of networks, including Ethernet, Fibre Channel, RapidIO, ATM, ITU-T G.hn and 802.11. This connectivity can be at any of the layers mentioned. While the layer-2 functionality is adequate for bandwidth-shifting within one technology, interconnecting technologies such as Ethernet and Token Ring is performed more easily at layer 3 or via routing. Devices that interconnect at the layer 3 are traditionally called routers.

Where there is a need for a great deal of analysis of network performance and security, switches may be connected between WAN routers as places for analytic modules. Some vendors provide firewall, network intrusion detection, and performance analysis modules that can plug into switch ports. Some of these functions may be on combined modules.

Through port mirroring, a switch can create a mirror image of data that can go to an external device, such as intrusion detection systems and packet sniffers.

A modern switch may implement power over Ethernet (PoE), which avoids the need for attached devices, such as a VoIP phone or wireless access point, to have a separate power supply. Since switches can have redundant power circuits connected to uninterruptible power supplies, the connected device can continue operating even when regular office power fails.

In 1989 and 1990, Kalpana introduced the first multiport Ethernet switch, its seven-port EtherSwitch.

== Bridging ==

Modern commercial switches primarily use Ethernet interfaces. The core function of an Ethernet switch is to provide multiple ports of layer-2 bridging. Layer-1 functionality is required in all switches in support of the higher layers. Many switches also perform operations at other layers. A device capable of more than bridging is known as a multilayer switch.

A layer 2 network device is a multiport device that uses hardware addresses (MAC addresses) to process and forward data at the data link layer (layer 2).

A switch operating as a network bridge may interconnect otherwise separate layer 2 networks. The bridge learns the MAC address of each connected device, storing this data in a table that maps MAC addresses to ports. This table is often implemented using high-speed content-addressable memory (CAM), some vendors refer to the MAC address table as a CAM table.

Bridges also buffer an incoming packet and adapt the transmission speed to that of the outgoing port. While there are specialized applications, such as storage area networks, where the input and output interfaces are the same bandwidth, this is not always the case in general LAN applications. In LANs, a switch used for end-user access typically concentrates lower bandwidth and uplinks into a higher bandwidth.

The Ethernet header at the start of the frame contains all the information required to make a forwarding decision, some high-performance switches can begin forwarding the frame to the destination whilst still receiving the frame payload from the sender. This cut-through switching can significantly reduce latency through the switch.

Interconnects between switches may be regulated using the spanning tree protocol (STP) that disables forwarding on links so that the resulting local area network is a tree without switching loops. In contrast to routers, spanning tree bridges must have topologies with only one active path between two points. Shortest path bridging and TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) are layer 2 alternatives to STP which allow all paths to be active with multiple equal cost paths.

== Types ==
=== Form factors ===
Switches are available in many form factors, including stand-alone, desktop units which are typically intended to be used in a home or office environment outside a wiring closet; rack-mounted switches for use in an equipment rack or an enclosure; DIN rail mounted for use in industrial environments; and small installation switches, mounted into a cable duct, floor box or communications tower, as found, for example, in fiber to the office infrastructures.

Rack-mounted switches may be stand-alone units, stackable switches or large chassis units with swappable line cards.

=== Configuration options ===
*es have no configuration interface or options. They are plug and play. They are typically the least expensive switches, and therefore often used in a small office/home office environment. Unmanaged switches can be desktop or rack mounted.
*Managed switches have one or more methods to modify the operation of the switch. Common management methods include: a command-line interface (CLI) accessed via serial console, telnet or Secure Shell, an embedded Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agent allowing management from a remote console or management station, or a web interface for management from a web browser. Two sub-classes of managed switches are smart and enterprise-managed switches.
*Smart switches (aka intelligent switches) are managed switches with a limited set of management features. Likewise, &quot;web-managed&quot; switches are switches that fall into a market niche between unmanaged and managed. For a price much lower than a fully managed switch they provide a web interface (and usually no CLI access) and allow configuration of basic settings, such as VLANs, port-bandwidth and duplex.
*Enterprise managed switches (aka managed switches) have a full set of management features, including CLI, SNMP agent, and web interface. They may have additional features to manipulate configurations, such as the ability to display, modify, backup and restore configurations. Compared with smart switches, enterprise switches have more features that can be customized or optimized and are generally more expensive than smart switches. Enterprise switches are typically found in networks with a larger number of switches and connections, where centralized management is a significant savings in administrative time and effort. A stackable switch is a type of enterprise-managed switch.

==== Typical management features ====
* Centralized configuration management and configuration distribution
* Enable and disable ports
* Link bandwidth and duplex settings
* Quality of service configuration and monitoring
* MAC filtering and other access control list features
* Configuration of Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) features
* Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) monitoring of device and link health
* Port mirroring for monitoring traffic and troubleshooting
* Link aggregation configuration to set up multiple ports for the same connection to achieve higher data transfer rates and reliability
* VLAN configuration and port assignments including IEEE 802.1Q tagging
* NTP (Network Time Protocol) synchronization
* Network access control features such as IEEE 802.1X 
* LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol)
* IGMP snooping for control of multicast traffic

==Traffic monitoring==

It is difficult to monitor traffic that is bridged using a switch because only the sending and receiving ports can see the traffic.

Methods that are specifically designed to allow a network analyst to monitor traffic include:
* Port mirroring Because the purpose of a switch is to &quot;not&quot; forward traffic to network segments where it would be superfluous, a node attached to a switch cannot monitor traffic on other segments. Port mirroring is how this problem is addressed in switched networks: In addition to the usual behavior of forwarding frames only to ports through which they might reach their addressees, the switch forwards frames received through a given &quot;monitored&quot; port to a designated &quot;monitoring&quot; port, allowing analysis of traffic that would otherwise not be visible through the switch.
* Switch monitoring (SMON) is described by RFC 2613 and is a provision for controlling facilities such as port mirroring.
* RMON
* sFlow

These monitoring features are rarely present on consumer-grade switches. Other monitoring methods include connecting a layer-1 hub or network tap between the monitored device and its switch port.

<text>An ohmmeter is an electrical instrument that measures electrical resistance (the opposition offered by a circuit or component to the flow of electric current). Multi-meters also function as ohmmeters when in resistance-measuring mode. An ohmmeter applies current to the circuit or component whose resistance is to be measured. It then measures the resulting voltage and calculates the resistance using Ohm’s law .

formula_1An ohmmeter should not be connected to a circuit or component that is carrying a current or is connected to a power source. Power should be disconnected before connecting the ohmmeter. Ohmmeters can be either connected in series or parallel based on requirements (whether resistance being measured is part of circuit or is a shunt resistance). 

==Design evolution==
The first ohmmeters were based on a type of meter movement known as a &#x27;radiometer&#x27;. These were similar to the galvanometer type movement encountered in later instruments, but instead of hairsprings to supply a restoring force they used conducting &#x27;ligaments&#x27;. These provided no net rotational force to the movement. Also, the movement was wound with two coils. One was connected via a series resistor to the battery supply. The second was connected to the same battery supply via a second resistor and the resistor under test. The indication on the meter was proportional to the ratio of the currents through the two coils. This ratio was determined by the magnitude of the resistor under test. The advantages of this arrangement were twofold. First, the indication of the resistance was completely independent of the battery voltage (as long as it actually produced some voltage) and no zero adjustment was required. Second, although the resistance scale was non linear, the scale remained correct over the full deflection range. By interchanging the two coils a second range was provided. This scale was reversed compared to the first. A feature of this type of instrument was that it would continue to indicate a random resistance value once the test leads were disconnected (the action of which disconnected the battery from the movement). Ohmmeters of this type only ever measured resistance as they could not easily be incorporated into a multimeter design. Insulation testers that relied on a hand cranked generator operated on the same principle. This ensured that the indication was wholly independent of the voltage actually produced.

Subsequent designs of ohmmeter provided a small battery to apply a voltage to a resistance via a galvanometer to measure the current through the resistance (battery, galvanometer and resistance all connected in series). The scale of the galvanometer was marked in ohms, because the fixed voltage from the battery assured that as resistance is increased, the current through the meter (and hence deflection) would decrease. Ohmmeters form circuits by themselves, therefore they cannot be used within an assembled circuit. This design is much simpler and cheaper than the former design, and was simple to integrate into a multi meter design and consequently was by far the most common form of analogue ohmmeter. This type of ohmmeter suffers from two inherent disadvantages. First, the meter needs to be zeroed by shorting the measurement points together and performing an adjustment for zero ohms indication prior to each measurement. This is because as the battery voltage decreases with age, the series resistance in the meter needs to be reduced to maintain the zero indication at full deflection. Second, and consequent on the first, the actual deflection for any given resistor under test changes as the internal resistance is altered. It remains correct at the centre of the scale only, which is why such ohmmeter designs always quote the accuracy &quot;at centre scale only&quot;.

A more accurate type of ohmmeter has an electronic circuit that passes a constant current (I) through the resistance, and another circuit that measures the voltage (V) across the resistance. These measurements are then digitized with an analog digital converter (adc) after which a microcontroller or microprocessor make the division of the current and voltage according to Ohm&#x27;s law and then decode these to a display to offer the user a reading of the resistance value they&#x27;re measuring at that instant. Since these type of meters already measure current, voltage and resistance all at once, these type of circuits are often used in digital multimeters.

==Precision ohmmeters==
For high-precision measurements of very small resistances, the above types of meter are inadequate. This is partly because the change in deflection itself is small when the resistance measured is too small in proportion to the intrinsic resistance of the ohmmeter (which can be dealt with through current division), but mostly because the meter&#x27;s reading is the sum of the resistance of the measuring leads, the contact resistances and the resistance being measured. To reduce this effect, a precision ohmmeter has four terminals, called Kelvin contacts. Two terminals carry the current from and to the meter, while the other two allow the meter to measure the voltage across the resistor. In this arrangement, the power source is connected in series with the resistance to be measured through the external pair of terminals, while the second pair connects in parallel with the galvanometer which measures the voltage drop. With this type of meter, any voltage drop due to the resistance of the first pair of leads and their contact resistances is ignored by the meter. This four terminal measurement technique is called Kelvin sensing, after William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, who invented the Kelvin bridge in 1861 to measure very low resistances. The Four-terminal sensing method can also be utilized to conduct accurate measurements of low resistances.

<text>A multimeter (also known as a volt-ohm-milliammeter, volt-ohmmeter or VOM) is a measuring instrument that can measure multiple electrical properties. A typical multimeter can measure voltage, resistance, and current, in which case can be used as a voltmeter, ohmmeter, and ammeter. Some feature the measurement of additional properties such as temperature and capacitance.

Analog multimeters use a microammeter with a moving pointer to display readings. Digital multimeters (DMMs) have numeric displays and are more precise than analog multimeters as a result. Meters will typically include probes that temporarily connect the instrument to the device or circuit under test, and offer some intrinsic safety features to protect the operator if the instrument is connected to high voltages that exceed its measurement capabilities.

Multimeters vary in size, features, and price. They can be portable handheld devices or highly-precise bench instruments.

Multimeters are used in diagnostic operations to verify the correct operation of a circuit or to test passive components for values in tolerance with their specifications.

== History ==

The first attested usage of the word &quot;multimeter&quot; listed by the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1907.

=== Precursors ===
The first moving-pointer current-detecting device was the galvanometer in 1820. These were used to measure resistance and voltage by using a Wheatstone bridge, and comparing the unknown quantity to a reference voltage or resistance. While useful in the lab, the devices were very slow and impractical in the field. These galvanometers were bulky and delicate.

The D&#x27;Arsonval–Weston meter movement uses a moving coil which carries a pointer and rotates on pivots or a taut band ligament. The coil rotates in a permanent magnetic field and is restrained by fine spiral springs which also serve to carry current into the moving coil. It gives proportional measurement rather than just detection, and deflection is independent of the orientation of the meter. Instead of balancing a bridge, values could be directly read off the instrument&#x27;s scale, which made measurement quick and easy.

The basic moving coil meter is suitable only for direct current measurements, usually in the range of 10 μA to 100 mA. It is easily adapted to read heavier currents by using shunts (resistances in parallel with the basic movement) or to read voltage using series resistances known as multipliers. To read alternating currents or voltages, a rectifier is needed. One of the earliest suitable rectifiers was the copper oxide rectifier developed and manufactured by Union Switch &amp; Signal Company, Swissvale, Pennsylvania, later part of Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company, from 1927.

=== Avometer ===

The invention of the first multimeter is attributed to British Post Office engineer, Donald Macadie, who became dissatisfied with the need to carry many separate instruments required for maintenance of telecommunication circuits. Macadie invented an instrument which could measure amperes (amps), volts and ohms, so the multifunctional meter was then named Avometer. The meter comprised a moving coil meter, voltage and precision resistors, and switches and sockets to select the range.

The first Avometer had a sensitivity of 60 Ω/V, three direct current ranges (12 mA, 1.2 A, and 12 A), three direct voltage ranges (12, 120, and 600 V or optionally 1,200 V), and a 10,000 Ω resistance range. An improved version of 1927 increased this to 13 ranges and 166.6 Ω/V (6 mA) movement. A &quot;Universal&quot; version having additional alternating current and alternating voltage ranges was offered from 1933 and in 1936 the dual-sensitivity Avometer Model 7 offered 500 and 100 Ω/V. Between the mid-1930s until the 1950s, 1,000 Ω/V became a de facto standard of sensitivity for radio work and this figure was often quoted on service sheets. However, some manufacturers such as Simpson, Triplett and Weston, all in the US, produced 20,000 Ω/V VOMs before the Second World War and some of these were exported. After 1945–46, 20,000 Ω/V became the expected standard for electronics, but some makers offered even more sensitive instruments. For industrial and other &quot;heavy-current&quot; use low sensitivity multimeters continued to be produced and these were considered more robust than the more sensitive types.

The Automatic Coil Winder and Electrical Equipment Company (ACWEECO), founded in 1923, was set up to manufacture the Avometer and a coil winding machine also designed and patented by MacAdie. Although a shareholder of ACWEECO, Mr MacAdie continued to work for the Post Office until his retirement in 1933. His son, Hugh S. MacAdie, joined ACWEECO in 1927 and became Technical Director. The first AVO was put on sale in 1923, and many of its features remained almost unaltered through to the last Model 8.

=== Pocket watch meters ===
Pocket-watch-style meters were in widespread use in the 1920s. The metal case was typically connected to the negative connection, an arrangement that caused numerous electric shocks. The technical specifications of these devices were often crude, for example the one illustrated has a resistance of just 25 Ω/V, a non-linear scale and no zero adjustment on both ranges.

=== Vacuum tube voltmeters ===
Vacuum tube voltmeters or valve voltmeters (VTVM, VVM) were used for voltage measurements in electronic circuits where high input impedance was necessary. The VTVM had a fixed input impedance of typically 1 MΩ or more, usually through use of a cathode follower input circuit, and thus did not significantly load the circuit being tested. VTVMs were used before the introduction of electronic high-impedance analog transistor and field effect transistor voltmeters (FETVOMs). Modern digital meters (DVMs) and some modern analog meters also use electronic input circuitry to achieve high input impedance—their voltage ranges are functionally equivalent to VTVMs. The input impedance of some poorly designed DVMs (especially some early designs) would vary over the course of a sample-and-hold internal measurement cycle, causing disturbances to some sensitive circuits under test.

=== Introduction of digital meters ===

The first digital multimeter was manufactured in 1955 by Non Linear Systems.

It is claimed that the first handheld digital multimeter was developed by Frank Bishop of Intron Electronics in 1977, which at the time presented a major breakthrough for servicing and fault finding in the field.

== Features ==
Any meter will load the circuit under test to some extent. For example, a multimeter using a moving coil movement with full-scale deflection current of 50 microamps (μA), the highest sensitivity commonly available, must draw at least 50 μA from the circuit under test for the meter to reach the top end of its scale. This may load a high-impedance circuit so much as to affect the circuit, thereby giving a low reading. The full-scale deflection current may also be expressed in terms of &quot;ohms per volt&quot; (Ω/V). The ohms per volt figure is often called the &quot;sensitivity&quot; of the instrument. Thus a meter with a 50 μA movement will have a &quot;sensitivity&quot; of 20,000 Ω/V. &quot;Per volt&quot; refers to the fact that the impedance the meter presents to the circuit under test will be 20,000 Ω multiplied by the full-scale voltage to which the meter is set. For example, if the meter is set to a range of 300 V full scale, the meter&#x27;s impedance will be 6 MΩ. 20,000 Ω/V is the best (highest) sensitivity available for typical analog multimeters that lack internal amplifiers. For meters that do have internal amplifiers (VTVMs, FETVMs, etc.), the input impedance is fixed by the amplifier circuit.

Additional scales such as decibels, and measurement functions such as capacitance, transistor gain, frequency, duty cycle, display hold, and continuity which sounds a buzzer when the measured resistance is small have been included on many multimeters. While multimeters may be supplemented by more specialized equipment in a technician&#x27;s toolkit, some multimeters include additional functions for specialized applications (temperature with a thermocouple probe, inductance, connectivity to a computer, speaking measured value, etc.).

Contemporary multimeters can measure many values. The most common are:

* Voltage, alternating and direct, in volts.
* Current, alternating and direct, in amperes. The frequency range for which AC measurements are accurate is important, depends on the circuitry design and construction, and should be specified, so users can evaluate the readings they take. Some meters measure currents as low as milliamps or even microamps. All meters have a burden voltage (caused by the combination of the shunt used and the meter&#x27;s circuit design), and some (even expensive ones) have sufficiently high burden voltages that low current readings are seriously impaired. Meter specifications should include the burden voltage of the meter.
* Resistance in ohms.
Additionally, some multimeters also measure:
* Capacitance in farads, but usually the limitations of the range are between a few hundred or thousand micro farads and a few pico farads. Very few general purpose multimeters can measure other important aspects of capacitor status such as ESR, dissipation factor, or leakage.
* Conductance in siemens, which is the inverse of the resistance measured.
* Decibels in circuitry, rarely in sound.
* Duty cycle as a percentage.
* Frequency in hertz.
* Inductance in henries. Like capacitance measurement, this is usually better handled by a purpose designed inductance / capacitance meter.
* Temperature in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit, with an appropriate temperature test probe, often a thermocouple.

Digital multimeters may also include circuits for:

* Continuity tester; a buzzer sounds when a circuit&#x27;s resistance is low enough (just how low is enough varies from meter to meter), so the test must be treated as inexact.
* Diodes (measuring forward drop of diode junctions).
* Transistors (measuring current gain and other parameters in some kinds of transistors)
* Battery checking for simple 1.5 V and 9 V batteries. This is a current-loaded measurement, which simulates in-use battery loads; normal voltage ranges draw very little current from the battery.

Various sensors can be attached to (or included in) multimeters to take measurements such as:

* Luminance
* Sound pressure level
* pH
* Relative humidity
* Very small current flow (down to nanoamps with some adapters)
* Very small resistances (down to micro ohms for some adapters)
* Large currents: adapters are available which use inductance (AC current only) or Hall effect sensors (both AC and DC current), usually through insulated clamp jaws to avoid direct contact with high current capacity circuits which can be dangerous, to the meter and to the operator
* Very high voltages: adapters are available which form a voltage divider with the meter&#x27;s internal resistance, allowing measurement into the thousands of volts. However, very high voltages often have surprising behavior, aside from effects on the operator (perhaps fatal); high voltages which actually reach a meter&#x27;s internal circuitry may internal damage parts, perhaps destroying the meter or permanently ruining its performance.

== Designs ==

=== Analog ===
An un-amplified analog multimeter combines a meter movement, range resistors and switches; VTVMs are amplified analog meters and contain active circuitry. For an analog meter movement, DC voltage is measured with a series resistor connected between the meter movement and the circuit under test. A switch (usually rotary) allows greater resistance to be inserted in series with the meter movement to read higher voltages. The product of the basic full-scale deflection current of the movement, and the sum of the series resistance and the movement&#x27;s own resistance, gives the full-scale voltage of the range. As an example, a meter movement that required 1 mA for full-scale deflection, with an internal resistance of 500 Ω, would, on a 10 V range of the multimeter, have 9,500 Ω of series resistance. For analog current ranges, matched low-resistance shunts are connected in parallel with the meter movement to divert most of the current around the coil. Again for the case of a hypothetical 1 mA, 500 Ω movement on a 1 A range, the shunt resistance would be just over 0.5 Ω.

Moving coil instruments can respond only to the average value of the current through them. To measure alternating current, which changes up and down repeatedly, a rectifier is inserted in the circuit so that each negative half cycle is inverted; the result is a varying and nonzero DC voltage whose maximum value will be half the AC peak to peak voltage, assuming a symmetrical waveform. Since the rectified average value and the root mean square (RMS) value of a waveform are only the same for a square wave, simple rectifier-type circuits can only be calibrated for sinusoidal waveforms. Other wave shapes require a different calibration factor to relate RMS and average value. This type of circuit usually has fairly limited frequency range. Since practical rectifiers have non-zero voltage drop, accuracy and sensitivity is poor at low AC voltage values.

To measure resistance, switches arrange for a small battery within the instrument to pass a current through the device under test and the meter coil. Since the current available depends on the state of charge of the battery which changes over time, a multimeter usually has an adjustment for the ohm scale to zero it. In the usual circuits found in analog multimeters, the meter deflection is inversely proportional to the resistance, so full-scale will be 0 Ω, and higher resistance will correspond to smaller deflections. The ohms scale is compressed, so resolution is better at lower resistance values.

Amplified instruments simplify the design of the series and shunt resistor networks. The internal resistance of the coil is decoupled from the selection of the series and shunt range resistors; the series network thus becomes a voltage divider. Where AC measurements are required, the rectifier can be placed after the amplifier stage, improving precision at low range.

The meter movement in a moving pointer analog multimeter is practically always a moving-coil galvanometer of the d&#x27;Arsonval type, using either jeweled pivots or taut bands to support the moving coil. In a basic analog multimeter the current to deflect the coil and pointer is drawn from the circuit being measured; it is usually an advantage to minimize the current drawn from the circuit, which implies delicate mechanisms. The sensitivity of an analog multimeter is given in units of ohms per volt. For example, a very low-cost multimeter with a sensitivity of 1,000 Ω/V would draw 1 mA from a circuit at full-scale deflection. More expensive, (and mechanically more delicate) multimeters typically have sensitivities of 20,000 ohms per volt and sometimes higher, with 50,000 ohms per volt (drawing 20 microamperes at full scale) being about the upper limit for a portable, general purpose, non-amplified analog multimeter.

To avoid the loading of the measured circuit by the current drawn by the meter movement, some analog multimeters use an amplifier inserted between the measured circuit and the meter movement. While this increases the expense and complexity of the meter, by use of vacuum tubes or field effect transistors the input resistance can be made very high and independent of the current required to operate the meter movement coil. Such amplified multimeters are called VTVMs (vacuum tube voltmeters), TVMs (transistor volt meters), FET-VOMs, and similar names.

Analog meters are intuitive where the trend of a measurement was more important than an exact value obtained at a particular moment. A change in angle or in a proportion is easier to interpret than a change in the value of a digital readout. For this reason, some digital multimeters additionally have a bar graph as a second display, typically with a more rapid sampling rate than used for the primary readout. These fast sampling rate bar graphs have a superior response than the physical pointer of analog meters, obsoleting the older technology. With rapidly fluctuating DC, AC or a combination of both, advanced digital meters are able to track and display fluctuations better than analog meters whilst also having the ability to separate and simultaneously display DC and AC components.

Because of the absence of amplification, ordinary analog multimeter are typically less susceptible to radio frequency interference, and so continue to have a prominent place in some fields even in a world of more accurate and flexible electronic multimeters.

Analog meter movements are inherently more fragile physically and electrically than digital meters. Many analog multimeters feature a range switch position marked &quot;off&quot; to protect the meter movement during transportation which places a low resistance across the meter movement, resulting in dynamic braking. Meter movements as separate components may be protected in the same manner by connecting a shorting or jumper wire between the terminals when not in use. Meters which feature a shunt across the winding such as an ammeter may not require further resistance to arrest uncontrolled movements of the meter needle because of the low resistance of the shunt.

High-quality analog multimeters continue to be made by several manufacturers, including Chauvin Arnoux (France), Gossen Metrawatt (Germany), and Simpson and Triplett (USA).

=== Digital ===


Digital instruments, which necessarily incorporate amplifiers, use the same principles as analog instruments for resistance readings. For resistance measurements, usually a small constant current is passed through the device under test and the digital multimeter reads the resultant voltage drop; this eliminates the scale compression found in analog meters, but requires a source of precise current. An autoranging digital multimeter can automatically adjust the scaling network so the measurement circuits use the full precision of the A/D converter.

In a digital multimeter the signal under test is converted to a voltage and an amplifier with electronically controlled gain preconditions the signal. A digital multimeter displays the quantity measured as a number, which eliminates parallax errors.

Modern digital multimeters may have an embedded computer, which provides a wealth of convenience features. Measurement enhancements available include:

* Auto-ranging, which selects the correct range for the quantity under test so that the most significant digits are shown. For example, a four-digit multimeter would automatically select an appropriate range to display 12.34 mV instead of 0.012 V, or overloading. Auto-ranging meters usually include a facility to hold the meter to a particular range, because a measurement that causes frequent range changes can be distracting to the user.
* Auto-polarity for direct-current readings, shows if the electric polarity of applied voltage is positive (agrees with meter lead labels) or negative (opposite polarity to meter leads).
* Sample and hold, which will latch the most recent reading for examination after the instrument is removed from the circuit under test.
* Current-limited tests for voltage drop across semi conductor junctions. While not a replacement for a proper transistor tester, and most certainly not for a swept curve tracer type, this facilitates testing diodes and a variety of transistor types.
* A graphic representation of the quantity under test, as a bar graph. This makes go/no-go testing easy, and also allows spotting of fast-moving trends.
* A low-bandwidth oscilloscope.
* Automotive circuit testers, including tests for automotive timing and dwell signals (dwell and engine rpm testing is usually available as an option and is not included in the basic automotive DMMs).
* Simple data acquisition features to record maximum and minimum readings over a given period, or to take a number of samples at fixed intervals.
* Integration with tweezers for surface-mount technology.
* A combined LCR meter for small-size SMD and through-hole components.

Modern meters may be interfaced with a personal computer by IrDA links, RS-232 connections, USB, Bluetooth, or an instrument bus such as IEEE-488. The interface allows the computer to record measurements as they are made. Some DMMs can store measurements and upload them to a computer.

== Components ==

=== Probes ===

A multimeter can use many different test probes to connect to the circuit or device under test. Crocodile clips, retractable hook clips, and pointed probes are the three most common types. Tweezer probes are used for closely spaced test points, as for instance surface-mount devices. The connectors are attached to flexible, well insulated leads terminated with connectors appropriate for the meter. Probes are connected to portable meters typically by shrouded or recessed banana jacks, while benchtop meters may use banana jacks or BNC connectors. 2 mm plugs and binding posts have also been used at times, but are less commonly used today. Indeed, safety ratings now require shrouded banana jacks.

The banana jacks are typically placed with a standardized center-to-center distance of , to allow standard adapters or devices such as voltage multiplier or thermocouple probes to be plugged in.

Clamp meters clamp around a conductor carrying a current to measure without the need to connect the meter in series with the circuit, or make metallic contact at all. Those for AC measurement use the transformer principle; clamp-on meters to measure small current or direct current require more exotic sensors, such as; hall effect based systems that measure the nonchanging magnetic field to determine the current.

=== Power supply ===
Analog meters can measure voltage and current by using power from the test circuit, but require a supplementary internal voltage source for resistance testing, while electronic meters always require an internal power supply to run their internal circuitry. Hand-held meters use batteries, while bench meters usually use mains power; either arrangement allows the meter to test devices. Testing often requires that the component under test be isolated from the circuit in which they are mounted, as otherwise stray or leakage current paths may distort measurements. In some cases, the voltage from the multimeter may turn active devices on, distorting a measurement, or in extreme cases even damage an element in the circuit being investigated.

=== Safety ===

Most multimeters include a fuse, or two fuses, which will sometimes prevent damage to the multimeter from a current overload on the highest current range. (For added safety, test leads with fuses built in are available.) A common error when operating a multimeter is to set the meter to measure resistance or current, and then connect it directly to a low-impedance voltage source. Unfused meters are often quickly destroyed by such errors; fused meters often survive. Fuses used in meters must carry the maximum measuring current of the instrument, but are intended to disconnect if operator error exposes the meter to a low-impedance fault. Meters with inadequate or unsafe fusing were not uncommon; this situation has led to the creation of the IEC61010 categories to rate the safety and robustness of meters.

Digital meters are rated into four categories based on their intended application, as set forth by IEC 61010-1 and echoed by country and regional standards groups such as the CEN EN61010 standard.

* Category I: used where equipment is not directly connected to the mains
* Category II: used on single phase mains final subcircuits
* Category III: used on permanently installed loads such as distribution panels, motors, and three-phase appliance outlets
* Category IV: used on locations where fault current levels can be very high, such as supply service entrances, main panels, supply meters, and primary over-voltage protection equipment

Each Category rating also specifies maximum safe transient voltages for selected measuring ranges in the meter. Category-rated meters also feature protections from over-current faults. On meters that allow interfacing with computers, optical isolation may be used to protect attached equipment against high voltage in the measured circuit.

Good quality multimeters designed to meet Category II and above standards include high rupture capacity (HRC) ceramic fuses typically rated at more than 20 A capacity; these are much less likely to fail explosively than more common glass fuses. They will also include high energy overvoltage MOV (Metal Oxide Varistor) protection, and circuit over-current protection in the form of a Polyswitch.

Meters intended for testing in hazardous locations or for use on blasting circuits may require use of a manufacturer-specified battery to maintain their safety rating.

== Characteristics ==

=== Resolution ===
The resolution of a multimeter is the smallest part of the scale which can be shown, which is scale dependent. On some digital multimeters it can be configured, with higher resolution measurements taking longer to complete. For example, a multimeter that has a 1 mV resolution on a 10 V scale can show changes in measurements in 1 mV increments. Absolute accuracy is the error of the measurement compared to a perfect measurement. Relative accuracy is the error of the measurement compared to the device used to calibrate the multimeter. Most multimeter datasheets provide relative accuracy. To compute the absolute accuracy from the relative accuracy of a multimeter add the absolute accuracy of the device used to calibrate the multimeter to the relative accuracy of the multimeter.

The resolution of a multimeter is often specified in the number of decimal digits resolved and displayed. If the most significant digit cannot take all values from 0 to 9 it is generally, and confusingly, termed a fractional digit. For example, a multimeter which can read up to 19999 (plus an embedded decimal point) is said to read digits. By convention, if the most significant digit can be either 0 or 1, it is termed a half-digit; if it can take higher values without reaching 9 (often 3 or 5), it may be called three-quarters of a digit. A -digit multimeter would display one &quot;half digit&quot; that could only display 0 or 1, followed by five digits taking all values from 0 to 9. Such a meter could show positive or negative values from 0 to 199999. A -digit meter can display a quantity from 0 to 3999 or 5999, depending on the manufacturer. While a digital display can easily be extended in resolution, the extra digits are of no value if not accompanied by care in the design and calibration of the analog portions of the multimeter. Meaningful (i.e., high-accuracy) measurements require a good understanding of the instrument specifications, good control of the measurement conditions, and traceability of the calibration of the instrument. However, even if its resolution exceeds the accuracy, a meter can be useful for comparing measurements. For example, a meter reading stable digits may indicate that one nominally 100 kΩ resistor is about 7 Ω greater than another, although the error of each measurement is 0.2% of reading plus 0.05% of full-scale value. Specifying &quot;display counts&quot; is another way to specify the resolution. Display counts give the largest number, or the largest number plus one (to include the display of all zeros) the multimeter&#x27;s display can show, ignoring the decimal separator. For example, a -digit multimeter can also be specified as a 199999 display count or 200000 display count multimeter. Often the display count is just called the &#x27;count&#x27; in multimeter specifications. The accuracy of a digital multimeter may be stated in a two-term form, such as &quot;±1% of reading +2 counts&quot;, reflecting the different sources of error in the instrument.

Analog meters are older designs, but despite being technically surpassed by digital meters with bar graphs, may still be preferred by engineers and troubleshooters. One reason given is that analog meters are more sensitive (or responsive) to changes in the circuit that is being measured. A digital multimeter samples the quantity being measured over time, and then displays it. Analog multimeters continuously read the test value. If there are slight changes in readings, the needle of an analog multimeter will attempt to track it, as opposed to the digital meter having to wait until the next sample, giving delays between each discontinuous reading (plus the digital meter may additionally require settling time to converge on the value). The digital display value as opposed to an analog display is subjectively more difficult to read. This continuous tracking feature becomes important when testing capacitors or coils, for example. A properly functioning capacitor should allow current to flow when voltage is applied, then the current slowly decreases to zero and this &quot;signature&quot; is easy to see on an analog multimeter but not on a digital multimeter. This is similar when testing a coil, except the current starts low and increases. Resistance measurements on an analog meter, in particular, can be of low precision due to the typical resistance measurement circuit which compresses the scale heavily at the higher resistance values. Inexpensive analog meters may have only a single resistance scale, seriously restricting the range of precise measurements. Typically, an analog meter will have a panel adjustment to set the zero-ohms calibration of the meter, to compensate for the varying voltage of the meter battery, and the resistance of the meter&#x27;s test leads.

=== Accuracy ===
Digital multimeters generally take measurements with accuracy superior to their analog counterparts. Standard analog multimeters measure with typically ±3% accuracy, though instruments of higher accuracy are made. Standard portable digital multimeters are specified to have an accuracy of typically ±0.5% on the DC voltage ranges. Mainstream bench-top multimeters are available with specified accuracy of better than ±0.01%. Laboratory grade instruments can have accuracies of a few parts per million.

Accuracy figures need to be interpreted with care. The accuracy of an analog instrument usually refers to full-scale deflection; a measurement of 30 V on the 100 V scale of a 3% meter is subject to an error of 3 V, 10% of the reading. Digital meters usually specify accuracy as a percentage of reading plus a percentage of full-scale value, sometimes expressed in counts rather than percentage terms.

Quoted accuracy is specified as being that of the lower millivolt (mV) DC range, and is known as the &quot;basic DC volts accuracy&quot; figure. Higher DC voltage ranges, current, resistance, AC and other ranges will usually have a lower accuracy than the basic DC volts figure. AC measurements only meet specified accuracy within a specified range of frequencies.

Manufacturers can provide calibration services so that new meters may be purchased with a certificate of calibration indicating the meter has been adjusted to standards traceable to, for example, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), or other national standards organization.

Test equipment tends to drift out of calibration over time, and the specified accuracy cannot be relied upon indefinitely. For more expensive equipment, manufacturers and third parties provide calibration services so that older equipment may be recalibrated and recertified. The cost of such services is disproportionate for inexpensive equipment; however extreme accuracy is not required for most routine testing. Multimeters used for critical measurements may be part of a metrology program to assure calibration.

A multimeter can be assumed to be &quot;average responding&quot; to AC waveforms unless stated as being a &quot;true RMS&quot; type. An average responding multimeter will only meet its specified accuracy on AC volts and amps for purely sinusoidal waveforms. A True RMS responding multimeter on the other hand will meet its specified accuracy on AC volts and current with any waveform type up to a specified crest factor; RMS performance is sometimes claimed for meters which report accurate RMS readings only at certain frequencies (usually low) and with certain waveforms (essentially always sine waves).

A meter&#x27;s AC voltage and current accuracy may have different specifications at different frequencies.

=== Sensitivity and input impedance ===
When used for measuring voltage, the input impedance of the multimeter must be very high compared to the impedance of the circuit being measured; otherwise circuit operation may be affected and the reading will be inaccurate. Meters with electronic amplifiers (all digital multimeters and some analog meters) have a fixed input impedance that is high enough not to disturb most circuits. This is often either one or ten megohms; the standardization of the input resistance allows the use of external high-resistance probes which form a voltage divider with the input resistance to extend voltage range up to tens of thousands of volts. High-end multimeters generally provide an input impedance greater than 10 GΩ for ranges less than or equal to 10 V. Some high-end multimeters provide &gt;10 Gigaohms of impedance to ranges greater than 10 V. Most analog multimeters of the moving-pointer type are unbuffered, and draw current from the circuit under test to deflect the meter pointer. The impedance of the meter varies depending on the basic sensitivity of the meter movement and the range which is selected. For example, a meter with a typical 20,000 Ω/V sensitivity will have an input resistance of 2 MΩ on the 100 V range (100 V × 20,000 Ω/V = 2,000,000 Ω). On every range, at full-scale voltage of the range, the full current required to deflect the meter movement is taken from the circuit under test. Lower sensitivity meter movements are acceptable for testing in circuits where source impedances are low compared to the meter impedance, for example, power circuits; these meters are more rugged mechanically. Some measurements in signal circuits require higher sensitivity movements so as not to load the circuit under test with the meter impedance.

Sensitivity should not be confused with resolution of a meter, which is defined as the lowest signal change (voltage, current, resistance and so on) that can change the observed reading.

For general-purpose digital multimeters, the lowest voltage range is typically several hundred millivolts AC or DC, but the lowest current range may be several hundred microamperes, although instruments with greater current sensitivity are available. Multimeters designed for (mains) &quot;electrical&quot; use instead of general electronics engineering use will typically forego the microamps current ranges. Measurement of low resistance requires lead resistance (measured by touching the test probes together) to be subtracted for best accuracy. This can be done with the &quot;delta&quot;, &quot;zero&quot;, or &quot;null&quot; feature of many digital multimeters. Contact pressure to the device under test and cleanliness of the surfaces can affect measurements of very low resistances. Some meters offer a four wire test where two probes supply the source voltage and the others take measurement. Using a very high impedance allows for very low voltage drop in the probes and resistance of the source probes is ignored resulting in very accurate results. The upper end of multimeter measurement ranges varies considerably; measurements over perhaps 600 volts, 10 amperes, or 100 megohms may require a specialized test instrument.

=== Burden voltage ===
Every inline series-connected ammeter, including a multimeter in a current range, has a certain resistance. Most multimeters inherently measure voltage, and pass a current to be measured through a shunt resistance, measuring the voltage developed across it. The voltage drop is known as the burden voltage, specified in volts per ampere. The value can change depending on the range the meter sets, since different ranges usually use different shunt resistors. The burden voltage can be significant in very low-voltage circuit areas. To check for its effect on accuracy and on external circuit operation the meter can be switched to different ranges; the current reading should be the same and circuit operation should not be affected if burden voltage is not a problem. If this voltage is significant it can be reduced (also reducing the inherent accuracy and precision of the measurement) by using a higher current range.

=== Alternating current sensing ===
Since the basic indicator system in either an analog or digital meter responds to DC only, a multimeter includes an AC to DC conversion circuit for making alternating current measurements. Basic meters utilize a rectifier circuit to measure the average or peak absolute value of the voltage, but are calibrated to show the calculated root mean square (RMS) value for a sinusoidal waveform; this will give correct readings for alternating current as used in power distribution. User guides for some such meters give correction factors for some simple non-sinusoidal waveforms, to allow the correct root mean square (RMS) equivalent value to be calculated. More expensive multimeters include an AC to DC converter that measures the true RMS value of the waveform within certain limits; the user manual for the meter may indicate the limits of the crest factor and frequency for which the meter calibration is valid. RMS sensing is necessary for measurements on non-sinusoidal periodic waveforms, such as found in audio signals and variable-frequency drives.

== Alternatives ==
A quality general-purpose electronics digital multimeter is generally considered adequate for measurements at signal levels greater than 1 mV or 1 μA, or below about 100 MΩ; these values are far from the theoretical limits of sensitivity, and are of considerable interest in some circuit design situations. Other instruments—essentially similar, but with higher sensitivity—are used for accurate measurements of very small or very large quantities. These include nanovoltmeters, electrometers (for very low currents, and voltages with very high source resistance, such as 1 TΩ) and picoammeters. Accessories for more typical multimeters permit some of these measurements, as well. Such measurements are limited by available technology, and ultimately by inherent thermal noise.

<text>Hayley Wickenheiser (born August 12, 1978) is a Canadian former ice hockey player, physician and assistant general manager for the Toronto Maple Leafs. She was the first woman to play full-time professional men’s hockey in a position other than goalie. Wickenheiser was a member of Canada women&#x27;s national ice hockey team for 23 years, from 1994 until announcing her retirement on January 13, 2017, and is the team&#x27;s career points leader with 168 goals and 211 assists in 276 games. She represented Canada at the Winter Olympics five times, capturing four gold and one silver medal and twice being named tournament MVP, and one time at the Summer Olympics in softball, and is a seven-time winner of the world championships. She is tied with teammates Caroline Ouellette and Jayna Hefford for the record for the most gold medals of any Canadian Olympian, and is widely considered to be the greatest female ice hockey player of all time. On February 20, 2014, Wickenheiser was elected to the International Olympic Committee&#x27;s Athletes&#x27; Commission. In 2019, she was named to the Hockey Hall of Fame, in her first year of eligibility. She was also inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2019, and Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 2022.

==Ice hockey career==

===Early years===
Wickenheiser began playing minor ice hockey on outdoor rinks in her hometown of Shaunavon, Saskatchewan when she was five years old. She played exclusively on boys&#x27; teams until she was 13. Wickenheiser continued playing minor hockey in Calgary, Alberta after moving there with her family. In 1991, she represented Alberta at the 18-and-under Canada Winter Games. Alberta captured the gold medal in the tournament, with Wickenheiser scoring the game-winning goal and being named the Most Valuable Player of the final game.

===International competition===
At the age of 15 (1994), Wickenheiser was named to Canada&#x27;s National Women&#x27;s Team for the first time and remained a member until her retirement in 2017. Her first international tournament was the 1994 World Championship, held in Lake Placid, New York. She played three games, and picked up her first international point—an assist, and Canada won gold. Her second World Championship in 1997 also produced a gold medal and she earned a spot on the tournament All-Star team, the first of four such honours (1997, 1999, 2000, 2005). In 1999, Wickenheiser helped Canada to another gold medal and was named tournament MVP. Wickenheiser has seven World Championship gold medals (1994, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2004, 2007, 2012) and three silver medals (2005, 2008, 2009). She was named to Team Canada in 2001, but was unable to compete due to an injury, and was also on Canada&#x27;s roster for the 2003 World Championship which was cancelled.

Wickenheiser was a member of Team Canada at the 1998 Winter Olympics, when women&#x27;s hockey was introduced as a medal sport. She also played 21 games for Team Canada during their pre-Olympic tour. Canada won a silver medal at the event and Wickenheiser was named to the tournament all-star team. Her performance at the 1998 Olympics impressed Men&#x27;s Team Canada General Manager Bobby Clarke so much, that he invited her to participate in the Philadelphia Flyers rookie camps in 1998 and 1999. 2002 was another chance at Olympic gold, and Wickenheiser was named to Canada&#x27;s roster for the 2002 Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City, Utah. On Team Canada&#x27;s pre-Olympic tour, Wickenheiser played 26 games and racked up 36 points. In a bit of redemption for 1998, Canada won the gold medal by defeating Team USA in the final game. Wickenheiser was named Tournament MVP and she was the top scorer on the Women&#x27;s side. At the 2006 Winter Olympics, Canada was defending its gold medal status. When the final match was set, Canada was facing off against Sweden, a surprise finalist. They won gold again, and Wickenheiser once more was named tournament MVP, Top Forward, and to a berth on the all-star team. She also led the tournament in scoring,
with five goals and 17 points in five games.

Wickenheiser captained Canada to a gold medal at the 1998 Christmas Cup (World Women&#x27;s Under-22 Championship). She has also contributed to at least 10 gold medals for Canada at the 4 Nations Cup tournaments (1996, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2010). At the 2006 Four Nations Cup, she served as team captain.

On February 17, 2010, Wickenheiser became the all-time leading Olympic goal scorer as Canada defeated Sweden 13–1 at the Vancouver Olympics. Wickenheiser reached her record total of 16 career Olympic goals by scoring once on Wednesday as Canada followed up their 18–0 win over Slovakia and 10–1 defeat of Switzerland.

Wickenheiser attended the World Hockey Summit in 2010, to address the status of women&#x27;s hockey internationally. International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge stated that the tournament might be eliminated from the Olympics since the event was not competitively balanced. Either Canada and the United States had won the gold since the event began in 1998, and the two countries had also won each IIHF World Women&#x27;s Championship since the event began in 1990. She explained that the talent gap between the North American and European countries was due to the presence of women&#x27;s professional leagues in North America, along with year-round training facilities. She stated the European players were talented, but their respective national team programs were not given the same level of support as the European men&#x27;s national teams, or the North American women&#x27;s national teams.

With a third and fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal in women&#x27;s hockey won by defeating the United States 2–0 in Vancouver and 3–2 in Sochi, Wickenheiser won 5 Olympic medals: 4 gold and 1 silver. She is one of only five athletes to win gold in four consecutive Winter Games, along with teammates Jayna Hefford and Caroline Ouellette. At her retirement in 2017 she was the Olympic tournament’s all-time leading scorer with 18 goals and 51 points. Wickenheiser took the athlete&#x27;s oath in English at the 2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Vancouver, British Columbia and was Canada&#x27;s flagbearer at the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014.

In 1996, Wickenheiser was named MVP of the Esso women&#x27;s hockey nationals, helping Alberta to a fourth-place finish. In 1997 and 1998, Wickenheiser won Nationals with the Edmonton Chimos and Calgary Oval X-Treme respectively. She was named tournament MVP both years. Between 1999 and 2001, Wickenheiser continued to play for her club teams at the Esso Women&#x27;s National Championships, winning a gold medal and two silvers. She played 2004–05 with the Calgary Oval X-Treme, in the inaugural season of the Western Women&#x27;s Hockey League. The X-Treme were league champions. Wickenheiser was the regular season leading scorer and named to the league&#x27;s all-star team. She also played for Alberta at the Esso National Championships, where they won gold. She led the tournament in scoring and was named MVP.

===Men&#x27;s professional leagues===
In 2003, Wickenheiser became the first woman to score a goal playing in a men&#x27;s semi-professional league (for HC Salamat in Suomi-sarja, Finland&#x27;s third-division league). Over the course of the two seasons, Wickenheiser played 22 games, scoring 1 goals and 3 assists. Wickenheiser joined a European league to play professional hockey, as the game is more open and less physical than North American leagues. This attempt to play professional hockey was not an entirely smooth process, as Wickenheiser was initially slated to play in Italy, until the Italian Winter Sports Federation ruled that women were ineligible to play in a men&#x27;s league. She also turned down an offer from Phil Esposito to play for the Cincinnati Cyclones of the ECHL. Finland&#x27;s Hockey Federation unanimously supported letting women play in a men&#x27;s league, allowing her to debut with HC Salamat in the Suomi-sarja, the third highest hockey league in Finland, on January 10, 2003. Wickenheiser played briefly with Salamat in 2004. They had won promotion to Mestis, Finland&#x27;s second tier of professional hockey, and this was not as good a fit for her. She left the team after ten games.

In 2007, Wickenheiser had a week-long tryout contract with Swedish club IFK Arboga IK in the Swedish male third league. After two practice games, where Wickenheiser scored two goals in the first game, she was not offered a contract. In 2008, Wickenheiser signed a one-year contract with Eskilstuna Linden, also in the Swedish men&#x27;s third league.

Wickenheiser was named one of the &quot;Top 100 Most Influential People in Hockey&quot; by &quot;The Hockey News&quot;—ranked #59 on the 2011 List—one of the &quot;25 Toughest Athletes&quot; by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, and one of the &quot;Top 50 Most Powerful Women in Canada&quot; by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;.

Wickenheiser scored a goal as a member of Team Black in the 2nd Canadian Women&#x27;s Hockey League All-Star Game. Appearing with the Calgary Inferno in the 2016 Clarkson Cup finals, she logged two assists as the Inferno emerged victorious in a convincing 8-3 final.

===Canadian university hockey===
Wickenheiser joined the 2010–11 Calgary Dinos women&#x27;s ice hockey team that competes in the Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS). The Dinos were playing their second season of CIS hockey, and Wickenheiser was expected to provide leadership to a young team. While with the Dinos, Wickenheiser played for her former teammate, Danielle Goyette, the team&#x27;s head coach. Wickenheiser also completed a degree in kinesiology at Calgary. The Dinos were Wickenheiser&#x27;s choice because the team practices every day, and she was able to stay in Calgary with her family. Under CIS rules, Wickenheiser began her first year of eligibility in 2010 because she had never played university hockey. Players have up to five years of eligibility. In her CIS debut against the University of Regina, Wickenheiser scored two goals and added an assist in a 4–3 victory. There were 587 people in attendance. Wickenheiser was named the Canada West female athlete of the week on November 2, 2010 after scoring three goals and adding an assist in two games against the University of Alberta. Despite only playing in 15 of the Dino&#x27;s 24 regular season games, Wickenheiser finished tied for the conference lead in scoring with 40 points (17 goals and 23 assists), and finishing with a plus-minus of +22. She scored four short handed goals, and had five game winners. At the end of the year, Wickenheiser was named the Canada West Most Valuable Player, and captured a spot on the conference&#x27;s First All-Star Team. On March 9, 2011, Wickenheiser was named the Canadian Interuniversity Sport player of the year in women&#x27;s hockey. She then became the first ever Dino to win the Brodrick Trophy as CIS MVP.

In the aftermath of the 2012-13 season, Wickenheiser was named to the CIS First Team All-Canadians. Among the other players named as First Team All-Canadians were Melodie Daoust and Katelyn Gosling.

===Post-playing career===
On January 13, 2017, Wickenheiser announced her retirement from professional hockey to pursue medical school. On August 23, 2018, Wickenheiser was hired as the assistant director of player development for the Toronto Maple Leafs. On May 17, 2021, Wickenheiser was promoted to senior director of player development for the Toronto Maple Leafs.

In 2021 she collaborated with sports equipment maker Verbero Hockey and owner/CEO Andy Sutton in developing the &quot;Wick Stick&quot;, the first time a hockey stick was constructed specifically with her input, part of a program to create branded equipment targeted toward women.

In 2022, Bell Media and Uninterrupted released a documentary film chronicling her life titled &quot;WICK&quot; .

In July 2022, she was named assistant general manager for the Toronto Maple Leafs.

==Softball and fastball career==
Wickenheiser is an accomplished softball player. On June 24, 2000, she was named to the Canadian softball team for the 2000 Summer Olympics. This was the culmination of a long ball career. In 1994, she participated at Canadian Midget Nationals, where she was named All-Canadian Shortstop and Top Batter. In 1995, Wickenheiser was a member of Team Canada at the World Junior Fastball Championships, held in Normal, Illinois. Canada finished fifth at this event. In 1997, Wickenheiser participated at Midget Nationals with the Silver Springs 76ers. Her team finished second and Wickenheiser was again named All Star Shortstop and Top Batter. In 1999, she also participated at Senior Nationals, where her team finished fourth. In 2000, Wickenheiser attended and competed for Simon Fraser University, and helped lead the team to a 38 and 13 record, en route to a 3rd-place finish at the NAIA National Championships. Later that summer she competed in the Summer Olympic games in Sydney, Australia, where she led Canada with the team&#x27;s highest batting average. Canada was competitive, but finished the tournament with a 1–6 record, losing three games by one run. Since that Olympics, Wickenheiser has not been as active in softball.

==Personal life==
Wickenheiser is the daughter of physical education teachers, Tom and Marilyn, and has a brother and a sister. Wickenheiser lives in Calgary with her son, Noah. Former professional hockey player Doug Wickenheiser was her cousin, as well as his daughter, soccer player Carly Wickenheiser.

Wickenheiser&#x27;s life story is the subject of a 2005 children&#x27;s book written by Elizabeth Etue, titled &quot;Born to Play&quot;. On July 15, 2011, her hometown of Shaunavon named a new 14 million dollar recreational complex after her, Crescent Point Wickenheiser Centre. On June 30, 2011, she was named an Officer of the Order of Canada by Governor General David Johnston.

Wickenheiser graduated with a degree in kinesiology in 2013. After retiring from professional hockey, she completed medical school at the University of Calgary&#x27;s Cumming School of Medicine in 2021. She completed her family medicine residency at University of Toronto&#x27;s Department of Family and Community Medicine in 2023 and is currently pursuing an enhanced skills program in emergency medicine.

Hayley is the author of &quot;Gold Medal Diary – Inside the World&#x27;s Greatest Sports Event&quot;, outlining her training with Team Canada and the events leading up to, during, and following the 2010 Olympic Games.

She is the founder of WickFest, an annual event showcasing girls&#x27; and women&#x27;s hockey, inviting female players from all over the world to several days of workshops, clinics and games learning from leading instructors, coaches and players.

==Video game appearance==
EA Sports officially announced in September 2012 that Wickenheiser would be among the first two female hockey players featured in the NHL video game series, set to appear in &quot;NHL 13&quot; along with Angela Ruggiero.

<doc id="40629" wikidata="Q709053" url="?curid=40629" title="Marc Gagnon">
<text>Marc Gagnon (born May 24, 1975) is a Canadian former short track speed skater. He is a four-time Overall World Champion for 1993, 1994, 1996 and 1998, and winner of three Olympic gold medals.

==Biography==
Born in Chicoutimi, Quebec, Gagnon started his Olympic career in 1994, when he had already won the 1993 World Championships. He won a bronze in the 1000 m event. Four years later, in Nagano, Japan, Gagnon won a gold medal with the Canadian relay team. The 2002 Salt Lake City Games proved to be Gagnon&#x27;s best Olympics, with a total of three medals. A bronze in the inaugural 1500 m event, and two golds; in the 500 m and again as a part of the relay team. Even his disqualification in the 1000 m was memorable, as it was the first of an improbable series of events that led to Australian Steven Bradbury winning arguably the most unlikely gold medal in Olympic history.

Winning a total of five medals in three consecutive Winter Games made him the most decorated Canadian athlete in Winter Olympic history until 2006. He has now been overtaken by long track speed skater Cindy Klassen, long track speed skater Clara Hughes and short track speed skater Charles Hamelin, who each have a total of 6 medals. Tied with track and field athlete Phil Edwards and fellow short track speed skater François-Louis Tremblay, he is one of the five most decorated Canadian athletes in all Olympic Games.

Gagnon won his World Championships in 1993, 1994, 1996 and 1998. He is the first man to have become a four-time Overall World Champion. In addition, he finished 2nd twice, and third once.

In 2007, Gagnon was inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame and inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 2008.

<doc id="40630" wikidata="Q40080" url="?curid=40630" title="Beach">
<text>A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. The particles composing a beach are typically made from rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, etc., or biological sources, such as mollusc shells or coralline algae. Sediments settle in different densities and structures, depending on the local wave action and weather, creating different textures, colors and gradients or layers of material.

Though some beaches form on inland freshwater locations such as lakes and rivers, most beaches are in coastal areas where wave or current action deposits and reworks sediments. Erosion and changing of beach geologies happens through natural processes, like wave action and extreme weather events. Where wind conditions are correct, beaches can be backed by coastal dunes which offer protection and regeneration for the beach. However, these natural forces have become more extreme due to climate change, permanently altering beaches at very rapid rates. Some estimates describe as much as 50 percent of the earth&#x27;s sandy beaches disappearing by 2100 due to climate-change driven sea level rise.

Sandy beaches occupy about one third of global coastlines. These beaches are popular for recreation, playing important economic and cultural roles—often driving local tourism industries. To support these uses, some beaches have human-made infrastructure, such as lifeguard posts, changing rooms, showers, shacks and bars. They may also have hospitality venues (such as resorts, camps, hotels, and restaurants) nearby or housing, both for permanent and seasonal residents.

Human forces have significantly changed beaches globally: direct impacts include bad construction practices on dunes and coastlines, while indirect human impacts include water pollution, plastic pollution and coastal erosion from sea level rise and climate change. Some coastal management practices are designed to preserve or restore natural beach processes, while some beaches are actively restored through practices like beach nourishment.

Wild beaches, also known as undeveloped or undiscovered beaches, are not developed for tourism or recreation. Preserved beaches are important biomes with important roles in aquatic or marine biodiversity, such as for breeding grounds for sea turtles or nesting areas for seabirds or penguins. Preserved beaches and their associated dune are important for protection from extreme weather for inland ecosystems and human infrastructure.

==Location and profile==
Although the seashore is most commonly associated with the word &quot;beach&quot;, beaches are also found by lakes and alongside large rivers.

&quot;Beach&quot; may refer to:
* small systems where rock material moves onshore, offshore, or alongshore by the forces of waves and currents; or
* geological units of considerable size.

The former are described in detail below; the larger geological units are discussed elsewhere under bars.

There are several conspicuous parts to a beach that relate to the processes that form and shape it. The part mostly above water (depending upon tide), and more or less actively influenced by the waves at some point in the tide, is termed the beach berm. The berm is the deposit of material comprising the active shoreline. The berm has a &quot;crest&quot; (top) and a &quot;face&quot;—the latter being the slope leading down towards the water from the crest. At the very bottom of the face, there may be a &quot;trough&quot;, and further seaward one or more long shore bars: slightly raised, underwater embankments formed where the waves first start to break.

The sand deposit may extend well inland from the &quot;berm crest&quot;, where there may be evidence of one or more older crests (the &quot;storm beach&quot;) resulting from very large storm waves and beyond the influence of the normal waves. At some point the influence of the waves (even storm waves) on the material comprising the beach stops, and if the particles are small enough (sand size or smaller), winds shape the feature. Where wind is the force distributing the grains inland, the deposit behind the beach becomes a &quot;dune&quot;.

These geomorphic features compose what is called the &quot;beach profile&quot;. The beach profile changes seasonally due to the change in wave energy experienced during summer and winter months. In temperate areas where summer is characterised by calmer seas and longer periods between breaking wave crests, the beach profile is higher in summer. The gentle wave action during this season tends to transport sediment up the beach towards the berm where it is deposited and remains while the water recedes. Onshore winds carry it further inland forming and enhancing dunes.

Conversely, the beach profile is lower in the storm season (winter in temperate areas) due to the increased wave energy, and the shorter periods between breaking wave crests. Higher energy waves breaking in quick succession tend to mobilise sediment from the shallows, keeping it in suspension where it is prone to be carried along the beach by longshore currents, or carried out to sea to form longshore bars, especially if the longshore current meets an outflow from a river or flooding stream. The removal of sediment from the beach berm and dune thus decreases the beach profile.

If storms coincide with unusually high tides, or with a freak wave event such as a tidal surge or tsunami which causes significant coastal flooding, substantial quantities of material may be eroded from the coastal plain or dunes behind the berm by receding water. This flow may alter the shape of the coastline, enlarge the mouths of rivers and create new deltas at the mouths of streams that had not been powerful enough to overcome longshore movement of sediment.

The line between beach and dune is difficult to define in the field. Over any significant period of time, sediment is always being exchanged between them. The &quot;drift line&quot; (the high point of material deposited by waves) is one potential demarcation. This would be the point at which significant wind movement of sand could occur, since the normal waves do not wet the sand beyond this area. However, the drift line is likely to move inland under assault by storm waves.

==Formation==

Beaches are the result of wave action by which waves or currents move sand or other loose sediments of which the beach is made as these particles are held in suspension. Alternatively, sand may be moved by saltation (a bouncing movement of large particles). Beach materials come from erosion of rocks offshore, as well as from headland erosion and slumping producing deposits of scree. A coral reef offshore is a significant source of sand particles. Some species of fish that feed on algae attached to coral outcrops and rocks can create substantial quantities of sand particles over their lifetime as they nibble during feeding, digesting the organic matter, and discarding the rock and coral particles which pass through their digestive tracts.

The composition of the beach depends upon the nature and quantity of sediments upstream of the beach, and the speed of flow and turbidity of water and wind. Sediments are moved by moving water and wind according to their particle size and state of compaction. Particles tend to settle and compact in still water. Once compacted, they are more resistant to erosion. Established vegetation (especially species with complex network root systems) will resist erosion by slowing the fluid flow at the surface layer. When affected by moving water or wind, particles that are eroded and held in suspension will increase the erosive power of the fluid that holds them by increasing the average density, viscosity, and volume of the moving fluid.

Coastlines facing very energetic wind and wave systems will tend to hold only large rocks as smaller particles will be held in suspension in the turbid water column and carried to calmer areas by longshore currents and tides. Coastlines that are protected from waves and winds will tend to allow finer sediments such as clay and mud to precipitate creating mud flats and mangrove forests. The shape of a beach depends on whether the waves are constructive or destructive, and whether the material is sand or shingle. Waves are constructive if the period between their wave crests is long enough for the breaking water to recede and the sediment to settle before the succeeding wave arrives and breaks.

Fine sediment transported from lower down the beach profile will compact if the receding water percolates or soaks into the beach. Compacted sediment is more resistant to movement by turbulent water from succeeding waves. Conversely, waves are destructive if the period between the wave crests is short. Sediment that remains in suspension when the following wave crest arrives will not be able to settle and compact and will be more susceptible to erosion by longshore currents and receding tides. The nature of sediments found on a beach tends to indicate the energy of the waves and wind in the locality.

Constructive waves move material up the beach while destructive waves move the material down the beach. During seasons when destructive waves are prevalent, the shallows will carry an increased load of sediment and organic matter in suspension. On sandy beaches, the turbulent backwash of destructive waves removes material forming a gently sloping beach. On pebble and shingle beaches the swash is dissipated more quickly because the large particle size allows greater percolation, thereby reducing the power of the backwash, and the beach remains steep. Compacted fine sediments will form a smooth beach surface that resists wind and water erosion.

During hot calm seasons, a crust may form on the surface of ocean beaches as the heat of the sun evaporates the water leaving the salt which crystallises around the sand particles. This crust forms an additional protective layer that resists wind erosion unless disturbed by animals or dissolved by the advancing tide. Cusps and horns form where incoming waves divide, depositing sand as horns and scouring out sand to form cusps. This forms the uneven face on some sand shorelines. White sand beaches look white because the quartz or eroded limestone in the sand reflects or scatters sunlight without significantly absorbing any colors.

===Sand colors===
The composition of the sand varies depending on the local minerals and geology. Some of the types of sand found in beaches around the world are:
* White sand: Mostly made of quartz and limestone, it can also contain other minerals like feldspar and gypsum .
* Light-colored sand: This sand gets its color from quartz and iron, and is the most common sand color in Southern Europe and other regions of the Mediterranean Basin, such as Tunisia.
* Tropical white sand: On tropical islands, the sand is composed of calcium carbonate from the shells and skeletons of marine organisms, like corals and mollusks, as found in Aruba.
* Pink coral sand: Like the above, is composed of calcium carbonate and gets its pink hue from fragments of coral, such as in Bermuda and the Bahama Islands.
* Black sand: Black sand is composed of volcanic rock, like basalt and obsidian, which give it its gray-black color. Hawaii&#x27;s Punaluu Beach, Madeira&#x27;s Praia Formosa and Fuerteventura&#x27;s Ajuy beach are examples of this type of sand.
* Red sand: This kind of sand is created by the oxidation of iron from volcanic rocks. Santorini&#x27;s Kokkini Beach or the beaches on Prince Edward Island in Canada are examples of this kind of sand.
* Orange sand: Orange sand is high on iron. It can also be a combination of orange limestone, crushed shells, and volcanic deposits. Ramla Bay in Gozo, Malta or Porto Ferro in Sardinia are examples of each, respectively.
* Green sand: In this kind of sand, the mineral olivine has been separated from other volcanic fragments by erosive forces. A famous example is Hawaii&#x27;s Papakolea Beach, which has sand containing basalt and coral fragments. Olivine beaches have a high potential for carbon sequestration, and artificial greensand beaches are being explored for this process by Project Vesta.

==Erosion and accretion==

===Natural erosion and accretion===



====Causes====

Beaches are changed in shape chiefly by the movement of water and wind. Any weather event that is associated with turbid or fast-flowing water or high winds will erode exposed beaches. Longshore currents will tend to replenish beach sediments and repair storm damage. Tidal waterways generally change the shape of their adjacent beaches by small degrees with every tidal cycle. Over time these changes can become substantial leading to significant changes in the size and location of the beach.

====Effects on flora====
Changes in the shape of the beach may undermine the roots of large trees and other flora. Many beach adapted species (such as coconut palms) have a fine root system and large root ball which tends to withstand wave and wind action and tends to stabilize beaches better than other trees with a lesser root ball.

====Effects on adjacent land====
Erosion of beaches can expose less resilient soils and rocks to wind and wave action leading to undermining of coastal headlands eventually resulting in catastrophic collapse of large quantities of overburden into the shallows. This material may be distributed along the beach front leading to a change in the habitat as sea grasses and corals in the shallows may be buried or deprived of light and nutrients.

===Humanmade erosion and accretion===
Coastal areas settled by man inevitably become subject to the effects of human-made structures and processes. Over long periods of time, these influences may substantially alter the shape of the coastline, and the character of the beach.

====Destruction of flora====
Beachfront flora plays a major role in stabilizing the foredunes and preventing beach head erosion and inland movement of dunes. If flora with network root systems (creepers, grasses, and palms) are able to become established, they provide an effective coastal defense as they trap sand particles and rainwater and enrich the surface layer of the dunes, allowing other plant species to become established. They also protect the berm from erosion by high winds, freak waves and subsiding floodwaters.

Over long periods of time, well-stabilized foreshore areas will tend to accrete, while unstabilized foreshores will tend to erode, leading to substantial changes in the shape of the coastline. These changes usually occur over periods of many years. Freak wave events such as tsunami, tidal waves, and storm surges may substantially alter the shape, profile and location of a beach within hours.

Destruction of flora on the berm by the use of herbicides, excessive pedestrian or vehicle traffic, or disruption to freshwater flows may lead to erosion of the berm and dunes. While the destruction of flora may be a gradual process that is imperceptible to regular beach users, it often becomes immediately apparent after storms associated with high winds and freak wave events that can rapidly move large volumes of exposed and unstable sand, depositing them further inland, or carrying them out into the permanent water forming offshore bars, lagoons or increasing the area of the beach exposed at low tide.
Large and rapid movements of exposed sand can bury and smother flora in adjacent areas, aggravating the loss of habitat for fauna, and enlarging the area of instability. If there is an adequate supply of sand, and weather conditions do not allow vegetation to recover and stabilize the sediment, wind-blown sand can continue to advance, engulfing and permanently altering downwind landscapes.

Sediment moved by waves or receding floodwaters can be deposited in coastal shallows, engulfing reed beds and changing the character of underwater flora and fauna in the coastal shallows.

Burning or clearance of vegetation on the land adjacent to the beach head, for farming and residential development, changes the surface wind patterns, and exposes the surface of the beach to wind erosion.

Farming and residential development are also commonly associated with changes in local surface water flows. If these flows are concentrated in stormwater drains emptying onto the beach head, they may erode the beach creating a lagoon or delta.

Dense vegetation tends to absorb rainfall reducing the speed of runoff and releasing it over longer periods of time. Destruction by burning or clearance of the natural vegetation tends to increase the speed and erosive power of runoff from rainfall. This runoff will tend to carry more silt and organic matter from the land onto the beach and into the sea. If the flow is constant, runoff from cleared land arriving at the beach head will tend to deposit this material into the sand changing its color, odor and fauna.

====Creation of beach access points====
The concentration of pedestrian and vehicular traffic accessing the beach for recreational purposes may cause increased erosion at the access points if measures are not taken to stabilize the beach surface above high-water mark. Recognition of the dangers of loss of beach front flora has caused many local authorities responsible for managing coastal areas to restrict beach access points by physical structures or legal sanctions, and fence off foredunes in an effort to protect the flora. These measures are often associated with the construction of structures at these access points to allow traffic to pass over or through the dunes without causing further damage.

====Concentration of runoff====
Beaches provide a filter for runoff from the coastal plain. If the runoff is naturally dispersed along the beach, water borne silt and organic matter will be retained on the land and will feed the flora in the coastal area. Runoff that is dispersed along the beach will tend to percolate through the beach and may emerge from the beach at low tide.

The retention of the freshwater may also help to maintain underground water reserves and will resist salt water incursion. If the surface flow of the runoff is diverted and concentrated by drains that create constant flows over the beach above the sea or river level, the beach will be eroded and ultimately form an inlet unless longshore flows deposit sediments to repair the breach.

Once eroded, an inlet may allow tidal inflows of salt water to pollute areas inland from the beach and may also affect the quality of underground water supplies and the height of the water table.

====Deprivation of runoff====
Some flora naturally occurring on the beach head requires freshwater runoff from the land. Diversion of freshwater runoff into drains may deprive these plants of their water supplies and allow sea water incursion, increasing the saltiness of the groundwater. Species that are not able to survive in salt water may die and be replaced by mangroves or other species adapted to salty environments.

====Inappropriate beach nourishment====
Beach nourishment is the importing and deposition of sand or other sediments in an effort to restore a beach that has been damaged by erosion. Beach nourishment often involves excavation of sediments from riverbeds or sand quarries. This excavated sediment may be substantially different in size and appearance to the naturally occurring beach sand.

In extreme cases, beach nourishment may involve placement of large pebbles or rocks in an effort to permanently restore a shoreline subject to constant erosion and loss of foreshore. This is often required where the flow of new sediment caused by the longshore current has been disrupted by construction of harbors, breakwaters, causeways or boat ramps, creating new current flows that scour the sand from behind these structures and deprive the beach of restorative sediments. If the causes of the erosion are not addressed, beach nourishment can become a necessary and permanent feature of beach maintenance.

During beach nourishment activities, care must be taken to place new sediments so that the new sediments compact and stabilize before aggressive wave or wind action can erode them. Material that is concentrated too far down the beach may form a temporary groyne that will encourage scouring behind it. Sediments that are too fine or too light may be eroded before they have compacted or been integrated into the established vegetation. Foreign unwashed sediments may introduce flora or fauna that are not usually found in that locality.

Brighton Beach, on the south coast of England, is a shingle beach that has been nourished with very large pebbles in an effort to withstand the erosion of the upper area of the beach. These large pebbles made the beach unwelcoming for pedestrians for a period of time until natural processes integrated the naturally occurring shingle into the pebble base.

==Use for recreation==

===History===
Even in Roman times, wealthy people spent their free time on the coast. They also built large villa complexes with bathing facilities (so-called maritime villas) in particularly beautiful locations. Excavations of Roman architecture can still be found today, for example on the Amalfi Coast near Naples and in Barcola in Trieste.

The development of the beach as a popular leisure resort from the mid-19th century was the first manifestation of what is now the global tourist industry. The first seaside resorts were opened in the 18th century for the aristocracy, who began to frequent the seaside as well as the then fashionable spa towns, for recreation and health. One of the earliest such seaside resorts, was Scarborough in Yorkshire during the 1720s; it had been a fashionable spa town since a stream of acidic water was discovered running from one of the cliffs to the south of the town in the 17th century. The first rolling bathing machines were introduced by 1735.
The opening of the resort in Brighton and its reception of royal patronage from King George IV, extended the seaside as a resort for health and pleasure to the much larger London market, and the beach became a centre for upper-class pleasure and frivolity. This trend was praised and artistically elevated by the new romantic ideal of the picturesque landscape; Jane Austen&#x27;s unfinished novel &quot;Sanditon&quot; is an example of that. Later, Queen Victoria&#x27;s long-standing patronage of the Isle of Wight and Ramsgate in Kent ensured that a seaside residence was considered as a highly fashionable possession for those wealthy enough to afford more than one home.

====Seaside resorts for the working class====
The extension of this form of leisure to the middle and working classes began with the development of the railways in the 1840s, which offered cheap fares to fast-growing resort towns. In particular, the completion of a branch line to the small seaside town of Blackpool from Poulton led to a sustained economic and demographic boom. A sudden influx of visitors, arriving by rail, led entrepreneurs to build accommodation and create new attractions, leading to more visitors and a rapid cycle of growth throughout the 1850s and 1860s.

The growth was intensified by the practice among the Lancashire cotton mill owners of closing the factories for a week every year to service and repair machinery. These became known as wakes weeks. Each town&#x27;s mills would close for a different week, allowing Blackpool to manage a steady and reliable stream of visitors over a prolonged period in the summer. A prominent feature of the resort was the promenade and the pleasure piers, where an eclectic variety of performances vied for the people&#x27;s attention. In 1863, the North Pier in Blackpool was completed, rapidly becoming a centre of attraction for upper class visitors. Central Pier was completed in 1868, with a theatre and a large open-air dance floor.

Many of the popular beach resorts were equipped with bathing machines, because even the all-covering beachwear of the period was considered immodest. By the end of the century the English coastline had over 100 large resort towns, some with populations exceeding 50,000.

====Expansion around the world====
The development of the seaside resort abroad was stimulated by the well-developed English love of the beach. The French Riviera alongside the Mediterranean had already become a popular destination for the British upper class by the end of the 18th century. In 1864, the first railway to Nice was completed, making the Riviera accessible to visitors from all over Europe. By 1874, residents of foreign enclaves in Nice, most of whom were British, numbered 25,000. The coastline became renowned for attracting the royalty of Europe, including Queen Victoria and King Edward VII.

Continental European attitudes towards gambling and nakedness tended to be more lax than in Britain, so British and French entrepreneurs were quick to exploit the possibilities. In 1863, Charles III, Prince of Monaco, and François Blanc, a French businessman, arranged for steamships and carriages to take visitors from Nice to Monaco, where large luxury hotels, gardens and casinos were built. This area of Monaco was then renamed Monte Carlo after prince Charles III.

Commercial sea bathing spread to the United States and parts of the British Empire by the end of the 19th century. The first public beach in the United States was Revere Beach, which opened in 1896. During that same time, Henry Flagler developed the Florida East Coast Railway, which linked the coastal sea resorts developing at St. Augustine, FL and Miami Beach, FL, to winter travelers from the northern United States and Canada on the East Coast Railway. By the early 20th century surfing was developed in Hawaii and Australia; it spread to southern California by the early 1960s. By the 1970s cheap and affordable air travel led to the growth of a truly global tourism market which benefited areas such as the Mediterranean, Australia, South Africa, and the coastal Sun Belt regions of the United States.

===Today===

Beaches can be popular on warm sunny days. In the Victorian era, many popular beach resorts were equipped with bathing machines because even the all-covering beachwear of the period was considered immodest. This social standard still prevails in many Muslim countries. At the other end of the spectrum are topfree beaches and nude beaches where clothing is optional or not allowed. In most countries social norms are significantly different on a beach in hot weather, compared to adjacent areas where similar behavior might not be tolerated and might even be prosecuted.

In more than thirty countries in Europe, South Africa, New Zealand, Canada, Costa Rica, South America and the Caribbean, the best recreational beaches are awarded Blue Flag status, based on such criteria as water quality and safety provision. Subsequent loss of this status can have a severe effect on tourism revenues.

Beaches are often dumping grounds for waste and litter, necessitating the use of beach cleaners and other cleanup projects. More significantly, many beaches are a discharge zone for untreated sewage in most underdeveloped countries; even in developed countries beach closure is an occasional circumstance due to sanitary sewer overflow. In these cases of marine discharge, waterborne disease from fecal pathogens and contamination of certain marine species are a frequent outcome.

===Artificial beaches===
Some beaches are artificial; they are either permanent or temporary (For examples, see Copenhagen, Hong Kong, Manila, Monaco, Nottingham, Paris, Rotterdam, Singapore, Tianjin, and Toronto).

The soothing qualities of a beach and the pleasant environment offered to the beachgoer are replicated in artificial beaches, such as &quot;beach style&quot; pools with zero-depth entry and wave pools that recreate the natural waves pounding upon a beach. In a zero-depth entry pool, the bottom surface slopes gradually from above water down to depth. Another approach involves so-called urban beaches, a form of public park becoming common in large cities. Urban beaches attempt to mimic natural beaches with fountains that imitate surf and mask city noises, and in some cases can be used as a play park.

Beach nourishment involves pumping sand onto beaches to improve their health. Beach nourishment is common for major beach cities around the world; however the beaches that have been nourished can still appear quite natural and often many visitors are unaware of the works undertaken to support the health of the beach. Such beaches are often not recognized by consumers as artificial. A famous example of beach nourishment came with the replenishment of Waikīkī Beach in Honolulu, Hawaii, where sand from Manhattan Beach, California was transported via ship and barge throughout most of the 20th century in order to combat Waikiki&#x27;s erosion problems. The Surfrider Foundation has debated the merits of artificial reefs with members torn between their desire to support natural coastal environments and opportunities to enhance the quality of surfing waves. Similar debates surround beach nourishment and snow cannon in sensitive environments.

===Restrictions on access===

Public access to beaches is restricted in some parts of the world. For example, most beaches on the Jersey Shore are restricted to people who can purchase beach tags. Many beaches in Indonesia, both private and public, require admission fees.
Some beaches also restrict dogs for some periods of the year.

==== Private beaches ====
Some jurisdiction make all beaches public by law. Some allow private ownership (for example by owners of abutting land or neighborhood associations) to the mean high tide line or mean low tide line. In some jurisdictions, the public has a general easement to use privately-owned beach land for certain purposes. Signs are sometimes posted where public access ends. 

In some places, such as Florida, it is not always clear which parts of a beach are public or private.

==== Public beaches ====
The first public beach in the United States opened on 12 July 1896, in the town of Revere, Massachusetts, with over 45,000 people attending on the opening day. The beach was run bay the Metropolitan Parks Commission and the new beach had a bandstand, public bathhouses, shade pavilions, and lined by a broad boulevard that ran along the beach.

Public access to beaches is protected by law in the U.S. state of Oregon, thanks to a 1967 state law, the Oregon Beach Bill, which guaranteed public access from the Columbia River to the California state line, &quot;so that the public may have the free and uninterrupted use&quot;. Public access to beaches in Hawaii (other than those owned by the U.S. federal government) is also protected by state law.

==Access design==
Beach access is an important consideration where substantial numbers of pedestrians or vehicles require access to the beach. Allowing random access across delicate foredunes is seldom considered good practice as it is likely to lead to destruction of flora and consequent erosion of the fore dunes.

A well-designed beach access should:
* provide a durable surface able to withstand the traffic flow;
* aesthetically complement the surrounding structures and natural landforms;
* be located in an area that is convenient for users and consistent with safe traffic flows;
* be scaled to match the traffic flow (i.e. wide and strong enough to safely carry the size and quantity of pedestrians and vehicles intended to use it);
* be maintained appropriately; and
* be signed and lit to discourage beach users from creating their own alternative crossings that may be more destructive to the beachhead.

===Concrete ramp or steps===
A concrete ramp should follow the natural profile of the beach to prevent it from changing the normal flow of waves, longshore currents, water and wind. A ramp that is below the beach profile will tend to become buried and cease to provide a good surface for vehicular traffic. A ramp or stair that protrudes above the beach profile will tend to disrupt longshore currents creating deposits in front of the ramp, and scouring behind. Concrete ramps are the most expensive vehicular beach accesses to construct requiring use of a quick-drying concrete or a cofferdam to protect them from tidal water during the concrete curing process. Concrete is favored where traffic flows are heavy and access is required by vehicles that are not adapted to soft sand (e.g. road registered passenger vehicles and boat trailers). Concrete stairs are commonly favored on beaches adjacent to population centers where beach users may arrive on the beach in street shoes, or where the foreshore roadway is substantially higher than the beach head and a ramp would be too steep for safe use by pedestrians. A composite stair ramp may incorporate a central or side stair with one or more ramps allowing pedestrians to lead buggies or small boat dollies onto the beach without the aid of a powered vehicle or winch. Concrete ramps and steps should be maintained to prevent a buildup of moss or algae that may make their wet surfaces slippery and dangerous to pedestrians and vehicles.

===Corduroy (beach ladder)===
A corduroy road or beach ladder (or board and chain) is an array of planks (usually hardwood or treated timber) laid close together and perpendicular to the direction of traffic flow, and secured at each end by a chain or cable to form a pathway or ramp over the sand dune. Corduroys are cheap and easy to construct and quick to deploy or relocate. They are commonly used for pedestrian access paths and light duty vehicular access ways. They naturally conform to the shape of the underlying beach or dune profile, and adjust well to moderate erosion, especially longshore drift. However, they can cease to be an effective access surface if they become buried or undermined by erosion by surface runoff coming from the beach head. If the corduroy is not wide enough for vehicles using it, the sediment on either side may be displaced creating a spoon drain that accelerates surface runoff and can quickly lead to serious erosion. Significant erosion of the sediment beside and under the corduroy can render it completely ineffective and make it dangerous to pedestrian users who may fall between the planks.

===Fabric ramp===
Fabric ramps are commonly employed by the military for temporary purposes where the underlying sediment is stable and hard enough to support the weight of the traffic. A sheet of porous fabric is laid over the sand to stabilize the surface and prevent vehicles from bogging. Fabric Ramps usually cease to be useful after one tidal cycle as they are easily washed away, or buried in sediment.

===Foliage ramp===
A foliage ramp is formed by planting resilient species of hardy plants such as grasses over a well-formed sediment ramp. The plants may be supported while they become established by placement of layers of mesh, netting, or coarse organic material such as vines or branches. This type of ramp is ideally suited for intermittent use by vehicles with a low wheel loading such as dune buggies or agricultural vehicles with large tyres. A foliage ramp should require minimal maintenance if initially formed to follow the beach profile, and not overused.

===Gravel ramp===
A gravel ramp is formed by excavating the underlying loose sediment and filling the excavation with layers of gravel of graduated sizes as defined by John Loudon McAdam. The gravel is compacted to form a solid surface according to the needs of the traffic. Gravel ramps are less expensive to construct than concrete ramps and are able to carry heavy road traffic provided the excavation is deep enough to reach solid subsoil. Gravel ramps are subject to erosion by water. If the edges are retained with boards or walls and the profile matches the surrounding beach profile, a gravel ramp may become more stable as finer sediments are deposited by percolating water.

==Longest beaches==
Amongst the world&#x27;s longest beaches are:
* Eighty Mile Beach () in north-west Australia;
* Praia do Cassino () in Brazil;
* Padre Island beach (about ) in Gulf of Mexico, Texas.
* Ninety Mile Beach, Victoria () in Victoria, Australia;
* Cox&#x27;s Bazar, Bangladesh ( unbroken);
* Naikoon Provincial Park () in the north-east of Haida Gwaii, Canada;
* Playa Novillera beach (about ) in Mexico.
* 90 Mile Beach in New Zealand ();
* Fraser Island beach (about ) in Queensland, Australia;
* Troia-Sines Beach () in Portugal;
* the Jersey Shore, 204 km/127 miles; and
* Long Beach, Washington (which is about ).

==Wildlife==

A beach is an unstable environment that exposes plants and animals to changeable and potentially harsh conditions. Some animals burrow into the sand and feed on material deposited by the waves. Crabs, insects and shorebirds feed on these beach dwellers. The endangered piping plover and some tern species rely on beaches for nesting. Sea turtles also bury their eggs in ocean beaches. Seagrasses and other beach plants grow on undisturbed areas of the beach and dunes.

Ocean beaches are habitats with organisms adapted to salt spray, tidal overwash, and shifting sands. Some of these organisms are found only on beaches. Examples of these beach organisms in the southeast US include plants like sea oats, sea rocket, beach elder, beach morning glory (&quot;Ipomoea pes-caprae&quot;), and beach peanut, and animals such as mole crabs (&quot;Hippoidea&quot;), coquina clams (&quot;Donax&quot;), ghost crabs, and white beach tiger beetles.

<text>In geometry, the convex hull, convex envelope or convex closure of a shape is the smallest convex set that contains it. The convex hull may be defined either as the intersection of all convex sets containing a given subset of a Euclidean space, or equivalently as the set of all convex combinations of points in the subset. For a bounded subset of the plane, the convex hull may be visualized as the shape enclosed by a rubber band stretched around the subset.

Convex hulls of open sets are open, and convex hulls of compact sets are compact. Every compact convex set is the convex hull of its extreme points. The convex hull operator is an example of a closure operator, and every antimatroid can be represented by applying this closure operator to finite sets of points.
The algorithmic problems of finding the convex hull of a finite set of points in the plane or other low-dimensional Euclidean spaces, and its dual problem of intersecting half-spaces, are fundamental problems of computational geometry. They can be solved in time formula_1 for two or three dimensional point sets, and in time matching the worst-case output complexity given by the upper bound theorem in higher dimensions.

As well as for finite point sets, convex hulls have also been studied for simple polygons, Brownian motion, space curves, and epigraphs of functions. Convex hulls have wide applications in mathematics, statistics, combinatorial optimization, economics, geometric modeling, and ethology. Related structures include the orthogonal convex hull, convex layers, Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagram, and convex skull.

==Definitions==

A set of points in a Euclidean space is defined to be convex if it contains the line segments connecting each pair of its points. The convex hull of a given set formula_2 may be defined as
#The (unique) minimal convex set containing formula_2
#The intersection of all convex sets containing formula_2
#The set of all convex combinations of points in formula_2
#The union of all simplices with vertices in formula_2
For bounded sets in the Euclidean plane, not all on one line, the boundary of the convex hull is the simple closed curve with minimum perimeter containing formula_2. One may imagine stretching a rubber band so that it surrounds the entire set formula_8 and then releasing it, allowing it to contract; when it becomes taut, it encloses the convex hull of formula_8. This formulation does not immediately generalize to higher dimensions: for a finite set of points in three-dimensional space, a neighborhood of a spanning tree of the points encloses them with arbitrarily small surface area, smaller than the surface area of the convex hull. However, in higher dimensions, variants of the obstacle problem of finding a minimum-energy surface above a given shape can have the convex hull as their solution.

For objects in three dimensions, the first definition states that the convex hull is the smallest possible convex bounding volume of the objects.
The definition using intersections of convex sets may be extended to non-Euclidean geometry, and the definition using convex combinations may be extended from Euclidean spaces to arbitrary real vector spaces or affine spaces; convex hulls may also be generalized in a more abstract way, to oriented matroids.

===Equivalence of definitions===

It is not obvious that the first definition makes sense: why should there exist a unique minimal convex set containing formula_2, for every formula_2? However, the second definition, the intersection of all convex sets containing formula_2, is well-defined. It is a subset of every other convex set formula_13 that contains formula_2, because formula_13 is included among the sets being intersected. Thus, it is exactly the unique minimal convex set containing formula_2. Therefore, the first two definitions are equivalent.

Each convex set containing formula_2 must (by the assumption that it is convex) contain all convex combinations of points in formula_2, so the set of all convex combinations is contained in the intersection of all convex sets containing formula_2. Conversely, the set of all convex combinations is itself a convex set containing formula_2, so it also contains the intersection of all convex sets containing formula_2, and therefore the second and third definitions are equivalent.

In fact, according to Carathéodory&#x27;s theorem, if formula_2 is a subset of a formula_23-dimensional Euclidean space, every convex combination of finitely many points from formula_2 is also a convex combination of at most formula_25 points in formula_2. The set of convex combinations of a formula_27-tuple of points is a simplex; in the plane it is a triangle and in three-dimensional space it is a tetrahedron. Therefore, every convex combination of points of formula_2 belongs to a simplex whose vertices belong to formula_2, and the third and fourth definitions are equivalent.

===Upper and lower hulls===
In two dimensions, the convex hull is sometimes partitioned into two parts, the upper hull and the lower hull, stretching between the leftmost and rightmost points of the hull. More generally, for convex hulls in any dimension, one can partition the boundary of the hull into upward-facing points (points for which an upward ray is disjoint from the hull), downward-facing points, and extreme points. For three-dimensional hulls, the upward-facing and downward-facing parts of the boundary form topological disks.

==Topological properties==
===Closed and open hulls===
The &quot;closed convex hull&quot; of a set is the closure of the convex hull, and the &quot;open convex hull&quot; is the interior (or in some sources the relative interior) of the convex hull.

The closed convex hull of formula_2 is the intersection of all closed half-spaces containing formula_2.
If the convex hull of formula_2 is already a closed set itself (as happens, for instance, if formula_2 is a finite set or more generally a compact set), then it equals the closed convex hull. However, an intersection of closed half-spaces is itself closed, so when a convex hull is not closed it cannot be represented in this way.

If the open convex hull of a set formula_2 is formula_23-dimensional, then every point of the hull belongs to an open convex hull of at most formula_36 points of formula_2. The sets of vertices of a square, regular octahedron, or higher-dimensional cross-polytope provide examples where exactly formula_36 points are needed.

===Preservation of topological properties===

Topologically, the convex hull of an open set is always itself open, and the convex hull of a compact set is always itself compact. However, there exist closed sets for which the convex hull is not closed. For instance, the closed set

:formula_39

(the set of points that lie on or above the witch of Agnesi) has the open upper half-plane as its convex hull.

The compactness of convex hulls of compact sets, in finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces, is generalized by the Krein–Smulian theorem, according to which the closed convex hull of a weakly compact subset of a Banach space (a subset that is compact under the weak topology) is weakly compact.

===Extreme points===

An extreme point of a convex set is a point in the set that does not lie on any open line segment between any other two points of the same set.
For a convex hull, every extreme point must be part of the given set, because otherwise it cannot be formed as a convex combination of given points.
According to the Krein–Milman theorem, every compact convex set in a Euclidean space (or more generally in a locally convex topological vector space) is the convex hull of its extreme points. However, this may not be true for convex sets that are not compact; for instance, the whole Euclidean plane and the open unit ball are both convex, but neither one has any extreme points. Choquet theory extends this theory from finite convex combinations of extreme points to infinite combinations (integrals) in more general spaces.

==Geometric and algebraic properties==
===Closure operator===
The convex-hull operator has the characteristic properties of a closure operator:
*It is &quot;extensive&quot;, meaning that the convex hull of every set formula_2 is a superset of formula_2.
*It is &quot;non-decreasing&quot;, meaning that, for every two sets formula_2 and formula_13 with formula_44, the convex hull of formula_2 is a subset of the convex hull of formula_13.
*It is &quot;idempotent&quot;, meaning that for every formula_2, the convex hull of the convex hull of formula_2 is the same as the convex hull of formula_2.
When applied to a finite set of points, this is the closure operator of an antimatroid, the shelling antimatroid of the point set.
Every antimatroid can be represented in this way by convex hulls of points in a Euclidean space of high-enough dimension.

===Minkowski sum===
The operations of constructing the convex hull and taking the Minkowski sum commute with each other, in the sense that the Minkowski sum of convex hulls of sets gives the same result as the convex hull of the Minkowski sum of the same sets. This provides a step towards the Shapley–Folkman theorem bounding the distance of a Minkowski sum from its convex hull.

===Projective duality===
The projective dual operation to constructing the convex hull of a set of points is constructing the intersection of a family of closed halfspaces that all contain the origin (or any other designated point).

==Special cases==
===Finite point sets===
The convex hull of a finite point set formula_50 forms a convex polygon when formula_51, or more generally a convex polytope in formula_52. Each extreme point of the hull is called a vertex, and (by the Krein–Milman theorem) every convex polytope is the convex hull of its vertices. It is the unique convex polytope whose vertices belong to formula_8 and that encloses all of formula_8.
For sets of points in general position, the convex hull is a simplicial polytope.

According to the upper bound theorem, the number of faces of the convex hull of formula_55 points in formula_23-dimensional Euclidean space is formula_57. In particular, in two and three dimensions the number of faces is at most linear in formula_55.

===Simple polygons===
The convex hull of a simple polygon encloses the given polygon and is partitioned by it into regions, one of which is the polygon itself. The other regions, bounded by a polygonal chain of the polygon and a single convex hull edge, are called &quot;pockets&quot;. Computing the same decomposition recursively for each pocket forms a hierarchical description of a given polygon called its &quot;convex differences tree&quot;. Reflecting a pocket across its convex hull edge expands the given simple polygon into a polygon with the same perimeter and larger area, and the Erdős–Nagy theorem states that this expansion process eventually terminates.

===Brownian motion===
The curve generated by Brownian motion in the plane, at any fixed time, has probability 1 of having a convex hull whose boundary forms a continuously differentiable curve. However, for any angle formula_59 in the range formula_60, there will be times during the Brownian motion where the moving particle touches the boundary of the convex hull at a point of angle formula_59. The Hausdorff dimension of this set of exceptional times is (with high probability) formula_62.

===Space curves===

For the convex hull of a space curve or finite set of space curves in general position in three-dimensional space, the parts of the boundary away from the curves are developable and ruled surfaces. Examples include the oloid, the convex hull of two circles in perpendicular planes, each passing through the other&#x27;s center, the sphericon, the convex hull of two semicircles in perpendicular planes with a common center, and D-forms, the convex shapes obtained from Alexandrov&#x27;s uniqueness theorem for a surface formed by gluing together two planar convex sets of equal perimeter.

===Functions===

The convex hull or lower convex envelope of a function formula_63 on a real vector space is the function whose epigraph is the lower convex hull of the epigraph of formula_63.
It is the unique maximal convex function majorized by formula_63. The definition can be extended to the convex hull of a set of functions (obtained from the convex hull of the union of their epigraphs, or equivalently from their pointwise minimum) and, in this form, is dual to the convex conjugate operation.

==Computation==
In computational geometry, a number of algorithms are known for computing the convex hull for a finite set of points and for other geometric objects.
Computing the convex hull means constructing an unambiguous, efficient representation of the required convex shape. Output representations that have been considered for convex hulls of point sets include a list of linear inequalities describing the facets of the hull, an undirected graph of facets and their adjacencies, or the full face lattice of the hull. In two dimensions, it may suffice more simply to list the points that are vertices, in their cyclic order around the hull.

For convex hulls in two or three dimensions, the complexity of the corresponding algorithms is usually estimated in terms of formula_55, the number of input points, and formula_67, the number of points on the convex hull, which may be significantly smaller than formula_55. For higher-dimensional hulls, the number of faces of other dimensions may also come into the analysis. Graham scan can compute the convex hull of formula_55 points in the plane in time formula_1. For points in two and three dimensions, more complicated output-sensitive algorithms are known that compute the convex hull in time formula_71. These include Chan&#x27;s algorithm and the Kirkpatrick–Seidel algorithm. For dimensions formula_72, the time for computing the convex hull is formula_57, matching the worst-case output complexity of the problem. The convex hull of a simple polygon in the plane can be constructed in linear time.

Dynamic convex hull data structures can be used to keep track of the convex hull of a set of points undergoing insertions and deletions of points, and kinetic convex hull structures can keep track of the convex hull for points moving continuously.
The construction of convex hulls also serves as a tool, a building block for a number of other computational-geometric algorithms such as the rotating calipers method for computing the width and diameter of a point set.

== Related structures ==

Several other shapes can be defined from a set of points in a similar way to the convex hull, as the minimal superset with some property, the intersection of all shapes containing the points from a given family of shapes, or the union of all combinations of points for a certain type of combination. For instance:
*The affine hull is the smallest affine subspace of a Euclidean space containing a given set, or the union of all affine combinations of points in the set.
*The linear hull is the smallest linear subspace of a vector space containing a given set, or the union of all linear combinations of points in the set.
*The conical hull or positive hull of a subset of a vector space is the set of all positive combinations of points in the subset.
*The visual hull of a three-dimensional object, with respect to a set of viewpoints, consists of the points formula_74 such that every ray from a viewpoint through formula_74 intersects the object. Equivalently it is the intersection of the (non-convex) cones generated by the outline of the object with respect to each viewpoint. It is used in 3D reconstruction as the largest shape that could have the same outlines from the given viewpoints.
*The circular hull or alpha-hull of a subset of the plane is the intersection of all disks with a given radius formula_76 that contain the subset.
*The relative convex hull of a subset of a two-dimensional simple polygon is the intersection of all relatively convex supersets, where a set within the same polygon is relatively convex if it contains the geodesic between any two of its points.
*The orthogonal convex hull or rectilinear convex hull is the intersection of all orthogonally convex and connected supersets, where a set is orthogonally convex if it contains all axis-parallel segments between pairs of its points.
*The orthogonal convex hull is a special case of a much more general construction, the hyperconvex hull, which can be thought of as the smallest injective metric space containing the points of a given metric space.
*The holomorphically convex hull is a generalization of similar concepts to complex analytic manifolds, obtained as an intersection of sublevel sets of holomorphic functions containing a given set.

The Delaunay triangulation of a point set and its dual, the Voronoi diagram, are mathematically related to convex hulls: the Delaunay triangulation of a point set in formula_77 can be viewed as the projection of a convex hull in formula_78
The alpha shapes of a finite point set give a nested family of (non-convex) geometric objects describing the shape of a point set at different levels of detail.
Each of alpha shape is the union of some of the features of the Delaunay triangulation, selected by comparing their circumradius to the parameter alpha. The point set itself forms one endpoint of this family of shapes, and its convex hull forms the other endpoint.
The convex layers of a point set are a nested family of convex polygons, the outermost of which is the convex hull, with the inner layers constructed recursively from the points that are not vertices of the convex hull.

The convex skull of a polygon is the largest convex polygon contained inside it. It can be found in polynomial time, but the exponent of the algorithm is high.

== Applications ==
Convex hulls have wide applications in many fields. Within mathematics, convex hulls are used to study polynomials, matrix eigenvalues, and unitary elements, and several theorems in discrete geometry involve convex hulls. They are used in robust statistics as the outermost contour of Tukey depth, are part of the bagplot visualization of two-dimensional data, and define risk sets of randomized decision rules. Convex hulls of indicator vectors of solutions to combinatorial problems are central to combinatorial optimization and polyhedral combinatorics. In economics, convex hulls can be used to apply methods of convexity in economics to non-convex markets. In geometric modeling, the convex hull property Bézier curves helps find their crossings, and convex hulls are part of the measurement of boat hulls. And in the study of animal behavior, convex hulls are used in a standard definition of the home range.

===Mathematics===

Newton polygons of univariate polynomials and Newton polytopes of multivariate polynomials are convex hulls of points derived from the exponents of the terms in the polynomial, and can be used to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the polynomial and the valuations of its roots. Convex hulls and polynomials also come together in the Gauss–Lucas theorem, according to which the roots of the derivative of a polynomial all lie within the convex hull of the roots of the polynomial.

In spectral analysis, the numerical range of a normal matrix is the convex hull of its eigenvalues.
The Russo–Dye theorem describes the convex hulls of unitary elements in a C*-algebra.
In discrete geometry, both Radon&#x27;s theorem and Tverberg&#x27;s theorem concern the existence of partitions of point sets into subsets with intersecting convex hulls.

The definitions of a convex set as containing line segments between its points, and of a convex hull as the intersection of all convex supersets, apply to hyperbolic spaces as well as to Euclidean spaces. However, in hyperbolic space, it is also possible to consider the convex hulls of sets of ideal points, points that do not belong to the hyperbolic space itself but lie on the boundary of a model of that space. The boundaries of convex hulls of ideal points of three-dimensional hyperbolic space are analogous to ruled surfaces in Euclidean space, and their metric properties play an important role in the geometrization conjecture in low-dimensional topology. Hyperbolic convex hulls have also been used as part of the calculation of canonical triangulations of hyperbolic manifolds, and applied to determine the equivalence of knots.

See also the section on Brownian motion for the application of convex hulls to this subject, and the section on space curves for their application to the theory of developable surfaces.

===Statistics===

In robust statistics, the convex hull provides one of the key components of a bagplot, a method for visualizing the spread of two-dimensional sample points. The contours of Tukey depth form a nested family of convex sets, with the convex hull outermost, and the bagplot also displays another polygon from this nested family, the contour of 50% depth.

In statistical decision theory, the risk set of a randomized decision rule is the convex hull of the risk points of its underlying deterministic decision rules.

===Combinatorial optimization===
In combinatorial optimization and polyhedral combinatorics, central objects of study are the convex hulls of indicator vectors of solutions to a combinatorial problem. If the facets of these polytopes can be found, describing the polytopes as intersections of halfspaces, then algorithms based on linear programming can be used to find optimal solutions. In multi-objective optimization, a different type of convex hull is also used, the convex hull of the weight vectors of solutions. One can maximize any quasiconvex combination of weights by finding and checking each convex hull vertex, often more efficiently than checking all possible solutions.

===Economics===

In the Arrow–Debreu model of general economic equilibrium, agents are assumed to have convex budget sets and convex preferences. These assumptions of convexity in economics can be used to prove the existence of an equilibrium.
When actual economic data is non-convex, it can be made convex by taking convex hulls. The Shapley–Folkman theorem can be used to show that, for large markets, this approximation is accurate, and leads to a &quot;quasi-equilibrium&quot; for the original non-convex market.

===Geometric modeling===
In geometric modeling, one of the key properties of a Bézier curve is that it lies within the convex hull of its control points. This so-called &quot;convex hull property&quot; can be used, for instance, in quickly detecting intersections of these curves.

In the geometry of boat and ship design, chain girth is a measurement of the size of a sailing vessel, defined using the convex hull of a cross-section of the hull of the vessel. It differs from the skin girth, the perimeter of the cross-section itself, except for boats and ships that have a convex hull.

===Ethology===
The convex hull is commonly known as the minimum convex polygon in ethology, the study of animal behavior, where it is a classic, though perhaps simplistic, approach in estimating an animal&#x27;s home range based on points where the animal has been observed. Outliers can make the minimum convex polygon excessively large, which has motivated relaxed approaches that contain only a subset of the observations, for instance by choosing one of the convex layers that is close to a target percentage of the samples, or in the local convex hull method by combining convex hulls of neighborhoods of points.

===Quantum physics===
In quantum physics, the state space of any quantum system — the set of all ways the system can be prepared — is a convex hull whose extreme points are positive-semidefinite operators known as pure states and whose interior points are called mixed states. The Schrödinger–HJW theorem proves that any mixed state can in fact be written as a convex combination of pure states in multiple ways.

===Thermodynamics===

A convex hull in thermodynamics was identified by Josiah Willard Gibbs (1873), although the paper was published before the convex hull was so named.
In a set of energies of several stoichiometries of a material, only those measurements on the lower convex hull will be stable. When removing a point from the hull and then calculating its distance to the hull, its distance to the new hull represents the degree of stability of the phase.

==History==
The lower convex hull of points in the plane appears, in the form of a Newton polygon, in a letter from Isaac Newton to Henry Oldenburg in 1676. The term &quot;convex hull&quot; itself appears as early as the work of , and the corresponding term in German appears earlier, for instance in Hans Rademacher&#x27;s review of . Other terms, such as &quot;convex envelope&quot;, were also used in this time frame. By 1938, according to Lloyd Dines, the term &quot;convex hull&quot; had become standard; Dines adds that he finds the term unfortunate, because the colloquial meaning of the word &quot;hull&quot; would suggest that it refers to the surface of a shape, whereas the convex hull includes the interior and not just the surface.

<text>NeXTSTEP is a discontinued object-oriented, multitasking operating system based on the Mach kernel and the UNIX-derived BSD. It was developed by NeXT Computer, founded by Steve Jobs, in the late 1980s and early 1990s and was initially used for its range of proprietary workstation computers such as the NeXTcube. It was later ported to several other computer architectures.

Although relatively unsuccessful at the time, it attracted interest from computer scientists and researchers. It hosted the original development of the Electronic AppWrapper, the first commercial electronic software distribution catalog to collectively manage encryption and provide digital rights for application software and digital media, a forerunner of the modern &quot;app store&quot; concept. It is the platform on which Tim Berners-Lee created the first web browser, and on which id Software developed the video games &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot;.

In 1996, Apple Computer acquired NeXT. Apple needed a successor to the classic Mac OS, and merged NeXTSTEP and OpenStep with the Macintosh user environment to create Mac OS X. All of Apple&#x27;s subsequent platforms since iPhone OS 1 were then based on Mac OS X (later renamed macOS).

==Overview==
NeXTSTEP (also stylized as NeXTstep, NeXTStep, and NEXTSTEP) is a combination of several parts:
* a Unix operating system based on the Mach kernel, plus BSD
* Display PostScript and a proprietary windowing engine
* the Objective-C language and runtime
* an object-oriented (OO) application layer, including several &quot;kits&quot;
* development tools for the OO layers.

NeXTSTEP is a preeminent implementation of the last three items. The toolkits are the canonical development system for all of the software on the system.

It introduced the idea of the Dock (carried through OpenStep and into macOS) and the Shelf. NeXTSTEP originated or innovated a large number of other GUI concepts which became common in other operating systems: 3D chiseled widgets, large full-color icons, system-wide drag and drop of a wide range of objects beyond file icons, system-wide piped services, real-time scrolling and window dragging, properties dialog boxes called &quot;inspectors&quot;, and window modification notices (such as the saved status of a file). The system is among the first general-purpose user interfaces to handle publishing color standards, transparency, sophisticated sound and music processing (through a Motorola 56000 DSP), advanced graphics primitives, internationalization, and modern typography, in a consistent manner across all applications.

Additional kits were added to the product line. These include Portable Distributed Objects (PDO), which allow easy remote invocation, and Enterprise Objects Framework, an object-relational database system. The kits made the system particularly interesting to custom application programmers, and NeXTSTEP had a long history in the financial programming community.

==History==
NeXTSTEP was built upon Mach and BSD, initially 4.3BSD-Tahoe. A preview release of NeXTSTEP (version 0.8) was shown with the launch of the NeXT Computer on October 12, 1988. The first full release, NeXTSTEP 1.0, shipped on September 18, 1989. It was updated to 4.3BSD-Reno in NeXTSTEP 3.0. The last version, 3.3, was released in early 1995, for the Motorola 68000 family based NeXT computers, Intel x86, Sun SPARC, and HP PA-RISC-based systems.

NeXT separated the underlying operating system from the application frameworks, producing OpenStep. OpenStep and its applications can run on multiple underlying operating systems, including OPENSTEP, Windows NT, and Solaris. In 1997, it was updated to 4.4BSD while assimilated into Apple&#x27;s development of Rhapsody for x86 and PowerPC. NeXTSTEP&#x27;s direct descendant is Apple&#x27;s macOS, which then yielded iPhone OS 1, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

==Legacy==
The first web browser, WorldWideWeb, and the first app store were all invented on the NeXTSTEP platform.

Some features and keyboard shortcuts now common to web browsers originated in NeXTSTEP conventions. The basic layout options of HTML 1.0 and 2.0 are attributable to those features of NeXT&#x27;s Text class.

Lighthouse Design Ltd. developed &quot;Diagram!&quot;, a drawing tool, originally called BLT (for Box-and-Line Tool) in which objects (boxes) are connected together using &quot;smart links&quot; (lines) to construct diagrams such a flow charts. This basic design can be enhanced by the simple addition of new links and new documents, located anywhere in the local area network, that foreshadowed Tim Berners-Lee&#x27;s initial prototype that was written on NeXTSTEP in October–December 1990.

In the 1990s, the pioneering PC games &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Doom II&quot;, &quot;Quake&quot;, and their respective level editors were developed by id Software on NeXT machines. Other games based on the &quot;Doom&quot; engine such as &quot;Heretic&quot; and its sequel &quot;&quot; by Raven Software, and &quot;Strife&quot; by Rogue Entertainment were developed on NeXT hardware using id&#x27;s tools.

Altsys made the NeXTSTEP application Virtuoso, version 2 of which was ported to Mac OS and Windows to become Macromedia FreeHand version 4. The modern &quot;Notebook&quot; interface for Mathematica, and the advanced spreadsheet Lotus Improv, were developed using NeXTSTEP. The software that controlled MCI&#x27;s Friends and Family calling plan program was developed using NeXTSTEP.

About the time of the release of NeXTSTEP 3.2, NeXT partnered with Sun Microsystems to develop OpenStep. It is the product of an effort to separate the underlying operating system from the higher-level object libraries to create a cross-platform object-oriented API standard derived from NeXTSTEP. OpenStep was released for Sun&#x27;s Solaris, Windows NT, and NeXT&#x27;s Mach kernel-based operating system. NeXT&#x27;s implementation is called &quot;OPENSTEP for Mach&quot; and its first release (4.0) superseded NeXTSTEP 3.3 on NeXT, Sun, and Intel IA-32 systems.

Following an announcement on December 20, 1996, Apple Computer acquired NeXT on February 4, 1997, for $429 million. Based upon the &quot;OPENSTEP for Mach&quot; operating system, and developing the OpenStep API to become Cocoa, Apple created the basis of Mac OS X, and eventually of iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

GNUstep is a free software implementation of the OpenStep standard.

==Release history==
Versions up to 4.1 are general releases. OPENSTEP 4.2 pre-release 2 is a bug-fix release published by Apple and supported for five years after its September 1997 release.

<text>Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) is a computer memory design used in multiprocessing, where the memory access time depends on the memory location relative to the processor. Under NUMA, a processor can access its own local memory faster than non-local memory (memory local to another processor or memory shared between processors). NUMA is beneficial for workloads with high memory locality of reference and low lock contention, because a processor may operate on a subset of memory mostly or entirely within its own cache node, reducing traffic on the memory bus.

NUMA architectures logically follow in scaling from symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) architectures. They were developed commercially during the 1990s by Unisys, Convex Computer (later Hewlett-Packard), Honeywell Information Systems Italy (HISI) (later Groupe Bull), Silicon Graphics (later Silicon Graphics International), Sequent Computer Systems (later IBM), Data General (later EMC, now Dell Technologies), Digital (later Compaq, then HP, now HPE) and ICL. Techniques developed by these companies later featured in a variety of Unix-like operating systems, and to an extent in Windows NT.

The first commercial implementation of a NUMA-based Unix system was the Symmetrical Multi Processing XPS-100 family of servers, designed by Dan Gielan of VAST Corporation for Honeywell Information Systems Italy.

== Overview ==
Modern CPUs operate considerably faster than the main memory they use. In the early days of computing and data processing, the CPU generally ran slower than its own memory. The performance lines of processors and memory crossed in the 1960s with the advent of the first supercomputers. Since then, CPUs increasingly have found themselves &quot;starved for data&quot; and having to stall while waiting for data to arrive from memory (e.g. for Von-Neumann architecture-based computers, see Von Neumann bottleneck). Many supercomputer designs of the 1980s and 1990s focused on providing high-speed memory access as opposed to faster processors, allowing the computers to work on large data sets at speeds other systems could not approach.

Limiting the number of memory accesses provided the key to extracting high performance from a modern computer. For commodity processors, this meant installing an ever-increasing amount of high-speed cache memory and using increasingly sophisticated algorithms to avoid cache misses. But the dramatic increase in size of the operating systems and of the applications run on them has generally overwhelmed these cache-processing improvements. Multi-processor systems without NUMA make the problem considerably worse. Now a system can starve several processors at the same time, notably because only one processor can access the computer&#x27;s memory at a time.

NUMA attempts to address this problem by providing separate memory for each processor, avoiding the performance hit when several processors attempt to address the same memory. For problems involving spread data (common for servers and similar applications), NUMA can improve the performance over a single shared memory by a factor of roughly the number of processors (or separate memory banks). Another approach to addressing this problem is the multi-channel memory architecture, in which a linear increase in the number of memory channels increases the memory access concurrency linearly.

Of course, not all data ends up confined to a single task, which means that more than one processor may require the same data. To handle these cases, NUMA systems include additional hardware or software to move data between memory banks. This operation slows the processors attached to those banks, so the overall speed increase due to NUMA heavily depends on the nature of the running tasks.

== Implementations ==
AMD implemented NUMA with its Opteron processor (2003), using HyperTransport. Intel announced NUMA compatibility for its x86 and Itanium servers in late 2007 with its Nehalem and Tukwila CPUs. Both Intel CPU families share a common chipset; the interconnection is called Intel QuickPath Interconnect (QPI), which provides extremely high bandwidth to enable high on-board scalability and was replaced by a new version called Intel UltraPath Interconnect with the release of Skylake (2017).

==Cache coherent NUMA (ccNUMA)==


Nearly all CPU architectures use a small amount of very fast non-shared memory known as cache to exploit locality of reference in memory accesses. With NUMA, maintaining cache coherence across shared memory has a significant overhead. Although simpler to design and build, non-cache-coherent NUMA systems become prohibitively complex to program in the standard von Neumann architecture programming model.

Typically, ccNUMA uses inter-processor communication between cache controllers to keep a consistent memory image when more than one cache stores the same memory location. For this reason, ccNUMA may perform poorly when multiple processors attempt to access the same memory area in rapid succession. Support for NUMA in operating systems attempts to reduce the frequency of this kind of access by allocating processors and memory in NUMA-friendly ways and by avoiding scheduling and locking algorithms that make NUMA-unfriendly accesses necessary.

Alternatively, cache coherency protocols such as the MESIF protocol attempt to reduce the communication required to maintain cache coherency. Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) is an IEEE standard defining a directory-based cache coherency protocol to avoid scalability limitations found in earlier multiprocessor systems. For example, SCI is used as the basis for the NumaConnect technology.

==NUMA vs. cluster computing==
One can view NUMA as a tightly coupled form of cluster computing. The addition of virtual memory paging to a cluster architecture can allow the implementation of NUMA entirely in software. However, the inter-node latency of software-based NUMA remains several orders of magnitude greater (slower) than that of hardware-based NUMA.

== Software support ==
Since NUMA largely influences memory access performance, certain software optimizations are needed to allow scheduling threads and processes close to their in-memory data.

* Microsoft Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 added support for NUMA architecture over 64 logical cores.
* Java 7 added support for NUMA-aware memory allocator and garbage collector.
* Linux kernel:
**Version 2.5 provided a basic NUMA support, which was further improved in subsequent kernel releases.
**Version 3.8 of the Linux kernel brought a new NUMA foundation that allowed development of more efficient NUMA policies in later kernel releases. 
**Version 3.13 of the Linux kernel brought numerous policies that aim at putting a process near its memory, together with the handling of cases such as having memory pages shared between processes, or the use of transparent huge pages; new sysctl settings allow NUMA balancing to be enabled or disabled, as well as the configuration of various NUMA memory balancing parameters.
* OpenSolaris models NUMA architecture with lgroups.
* FreeBSD added support for NUMA architecture in version 9.0.
*Silicon Graphics IRIX (discontinued as of 2021) support for ccNUMA architecture over 1240 CPU with Origin server series.

== Hardware support ==
As of 2011, ccNUMA systems are multiprocessor systems based on the AMD Opteron processor, which can be implemented without external logic, and the Intel Itanium processor, which requires the chipset to support NUMA. Examples of ccNUMA-enabled chipsets are the SGI Shub (Super hub), the Intel E8870, the HP sx2000 (used in the Integrity and Superdome servers), and those found in NEC Itanium-based systems. Earlier ccNUMA systems such as those from Silicon Graphics were based on MIPS processors and the DEC Alpha 21364 (EV7) processor.

<doc id="40645" wikidata="Q1162676" url="?curid=40645" title="Haar measure">
<text>In mathematical analysis, the Haar measure assigns an &quot;invariant volume&quot; to subsets of locally compact topological groups, consequently defining an integral for functions on those groups.

This measure was introduced by Alfréd Haar in 1933, though its special case for Lie groups had been introduced by Adolf Hurwitz in 1897 under the name &quot;invariant integral&quot;. Haar measures are used in many parts of analysis, number theory, group theory, representation theory, statistics, probability theory, and ergodic theory.

==Preliminaries==
Let formula_1 be a locally compact Hausdorff topological group. The formula_2-algebra generated by all open subsets of formula_3 is called the Borel algebra. An element of the Borel algebra is called a Borel set. If formula_4 is an element of formula_3 and formula_6 is a subset of formula_3, then we define the left and right translates of formula_6 by &quot;g&quot; as follows:
* Left translate: formula_9
* Right translate: formula_10

Left and right translates map Borel sets onto Borel sets.

A measure formula_11 on the Borel subsets of formula_3 is called &quot;left-translation-invariant&quot; if for all Borel subsets formula_13 and all formula_14 one has
:formula_15
A measure formula_11 on the Borel subsets of formula_3 is called &quot;right-translation-invariant&quot; if for all Borel subsets formula_13 and all formula_14 one has
:formula_20

==Haar&#x27;s theorem==
There is, up to a positive multiplicative constant, a unique countably additive, nontrivial measure formula_11 on the Borel subsets of formula_3 satisfying the following properties:

* The measure formula_11 is left-translation-invariant: formula_24 for every formula_14 and all Borel sets formula_13.
* The measure formula_11 is finite on every compact set: formula_28 for all compact formula_29.
* The measure formula_11 is outer regular on Borel sets formula_13: formula_32
* The measure formula_11 is inner regular on open sets formula_34: formula_35

Such a measure on formula_3 is called a &quot;left Haar measure.&quot; It can be shown as a consequence of the above properties that formula_37 for every non-empty open subset formula_34. In particular, if formula_3 is compact then formula_40 is finite and positive, so we can uniquely specify a left Haar measure on formula_3 by adding the normalization condition formula_42.

In complete analogy, one can also prove the existence and uniqueness of a &quot;right Haar measure&quot; on formula_3. The two measures need not coincide.

Some authors define a Haar measure on Baire sets rather than Borel sets. This makes the regularity conditions unnecessary as Baire measures are automatically regular. Halmos uses the nonstandard term &quot;Borel set&quot; for elements of the formula_2-ring generated by compact sets, and defines Haar measures on these sets.

The left Haar measure satisfies the inner regularity condition for all formula_2-finite Borel sets, but may not be inner regular for &quot;all&quot; Borel sets. For example, the product of the unit circle (with its usual topology) and the real line with the discrete topology is a locally compact group with the product topology and a Haar measure on this group is not inner regular for the closed subset formula_46. (Compact subsets of this vertical segment are finite sets and points have measure formula_47, so the measure of any compact subset of this vertical segment is formula_47. But, using outer regularity, one can show the segment has infinite measure.)

The existence and uniqueness (up to scaling) of a left Haar measure was first proven in full generality by André Weil. Weil&#x27;s proof used the axiom of choice and Henri Cartan furnished a proof that avoided its use. Cartan&#x27;s proof also establishes the existence and the uniqueness simultaneously. A simplified and complete account of Cartan&#x27;s argument was given by Alfsen in 1963. The special case of invariant measure for second-countable locally compact groups had been shown by Haar in 1933.

==Examples==

==Construction of Haar measure==
===A construction using compact subsets===

The following method of constructing Haar measure is essentially the method used by Haar and Weil.

For any subsets formula_49 with formula_6 nonempty define formula_51 to be the smallest number of left translates of formula_6 that cover formula_53 (so this is a non-negative integer or infinity). This is not additive on compact sets formula_54, though it does have the property that formula_55 for disjoint compact sets formula_56 provided that formula_57 is a sufficiently small open neighborhood of the identity (depending on formula_58 and formula_59). The idea of Haar measure is to take a sort of limit of formula_60 as formula_57 becomes smaller to make it additive on all pairs of disjoint compact sets, though it first has to be normalized so that the limit is not just infinity. So fix a compact set formula_62 with non-empty interior (which exists as the group is locally compact) and for a compact set formula_58 define
:formula_64
where the limit is taken over a suitable directed set of open neighborhoods of the identity eventually contained in any given neighborhood; the existence of a directed set such that the limit exists follows using Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem.

The function formula_65 is additive on disjoint compact subsets of formula_3, which implies that it is a regular content. From a regular content one can construct a measure by first extending formula_65 to open sets by inner regularity, then to all sets by outer regularity, and then restricting it to Borel sets. (Even for open sets formula_57, the corresponding measure formula_69 need not be given by the lim sup formula above. The problem is that the function given by the lim sup formula is not countably subadditive in general and in particular is infinite on any set without compact closure, so is not an outer measure.)

===A construction using compactly supported functions===

Cartan introduced another way of constructing Haar measure as a Radon measure (a positive linear functional on compactly supported continuous functions), which is similar to the construction above except that formula_62, formula_58, and formula_57 are positive continuous functions of compact support rather than subsets of formula_3. In this case we define formula_60 to be the infimum of numbers formula_75 such that formula_76 is less than the linear combination formula_77 of left translates of formula_57 for some formula_79.
As before we define
:formula_64.
The fact that the limit exists takes some effort to prove, though the advantage of doing this is that the proof avoids the use of the axiom of choice and also gives uniqueness of Haar measure as a by-product. The functional formula_65 extends to a positive linear functional on compactly supported continuous functions and so gives a Haar measure. (Note that even though the limit is linear in formula_58, the individual terms formula_60 are not usually linear in formula_58.)

===A construction using mean values of functions===

Von Neumann gave a method of constructing Haar measure using mean values of functions, though it only works for compact groups. The idea is that given a function formula_85 on a compact group, one can find a convex combination formula_86 (where formula_87) of its left translates that differs from a constant function by at most some small number formula_88. Then one shows that as formula_88 tends to zero the values of these constant functions tend to a limit, which is called the mean value (or integral) of the function formula_85.

For groups that are locally compact but not compact this construction does not give Haar measure as the mean value of compactly supported functions is zero. However something like this does work for almost periodic functions on the group which do have a mean value, though this is not given with respect to Haar measure.

===A construction on Lie groups===

On an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Lie group, Haar measure can be constructed easily as the measure induced by a left-invariant &quot;n&quot;-form. This was known before Haar&#x27;s theorem.

==The right Haar measure==

It can also be proved that there exists a unique (up to multiplication by a positive constant) right-translation-invariant Borel measure formula_91 satisfying the above regularity conditions and being finite on compact sets, but it need not coincide with the left-translation-invariant measure formula_11. The left and right Haar measures are the same only for so-called &quot;unimodular groups&quot; (see below). It is quite simple, though, to find a relationship between formula_11 and formula_94.

Indeed, for a Borel set formula_6, let us denote by formula_96 the set of inverses of elements of formula_6. If we define 
:formula_98
then this is a right Haar measure. To show right invariance, apply the definition:

:formula_99

Because the right measure is unique, it follows that formula_100 is a multiple of formula_94 and so
:formula_102
for all Borel sets formula_6, where formula_104 is some positive constant.

===The modular function===

The &quot;left&quot; translate of a right Haar measure is a right Haar measure. More precisely, if formula_94 is a right Haar measure, then for any fixed choice of a group element &quot;g&quot;,

:formula_106

is also right invariant. Thus, by uniqueness up to a constant scaling factor of the Haar measure, there exists a function formula_107 from the group to the positive reals, called the Haar modulus, modular function or modular character, such that for every Borel set formula_6

:formula_109

Since right Haar measure is well-defined up to a positive scaling factor, this equation shows the modular function is independent of the choice of right Haar measure in the above equation.

The modular function is a continuous group homomorphism from &quot;G&quot; to the multiplicative group of positive real numbers. A group is called unimodular if the modular function is identically formula_110, or, equivalently, if the Haar measure is both left and right invariant. Examples of unimodular groups are abelian groups, compact groups, discrete groups (e.g., finite groups), semisimple Lie groups and connected nilpotent Lie groups. An example of a non-unimodular group is the group of affine transformations

:formula_111

on the real line. This example shows that a solvable Lie group need not be unimodular.
In this group a left Haar measure is given by formula_112, and a right Haar measure by formula_113.

==Measures on homogeneous spaces==

If the locally compact group formula_3 acts transitively on a homogeneous space formula_115, one can ask if this space has an invariant measure, or more generally a semi-invariant measure with the property that formula_116 for some character formula_117 of formula_3. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such a measure is that the restriction formula_119 is equal to formula_120, where formula_107 and formula_122 are the modular functions of formula_3 and formula_124 respectively.
In particular an invariant measure on formula_115 exists if and only if the modular function formula_107 of formula_3 restricted to formula_124 is the modular function formula_122 of formula_124.

===Example===

If formula_3 is the group formula_132 and formula_124 is the subgroup of upper triangular matrices, then the modular function of formula_124 is nontrivial but the modular function of formula_3 is trivial. The quotient of these cannot be extended to any character of formula_3, so the quotient space formula_115 (which can be thought of as 1-dimensional real projective space) does not have even a semi-invariant measure.

==Haar integral==
Using the general theory of Lebesgue integration, one can then define an integral for all Borel measurable functions formula_85 on formula_3. This integral is called the Haar integral and is denoted as:
:formula_140
where formula_11 is the Haar measure.

One property of a left Haar measure formula_11 is that, letting formula_143 be an element of formula_3, the following is valid:
:formula_145
for any Haar integrable function formula_85 on formula_3. This is immediate for indicator functions:
:formula_148
which is essentially the definition of left invariance.

==Uses==

In the same issue of &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; and immediately after Haar&#x27;s paper, the Haar theorem was used to solve Hilbert&#x27;s fifth problem restricted to compact groups by John von Neumann.

Unless formula_3 is a discrete group, it is impossible to define a countably additive left-invariant regular measure on &quot;all&quot; subsets of formula_3, assuming the axiom of choice, according to the theory of non-measurable sets.

===Abstract harmonic analysis===
The Haar measures are used in harmonic analysis on locally compact groups, particularly in the theory of Pontryagin duality. To prove the existence of a Haar measure on a locally compact group formula_3 it suffices to exhibit a left-invariant Radon measure on formula_3.

===Mathematical statistics===
In mathematical statistics, Haar measures are used for prior measures, which are prior probabilities for compact groups of transformations. These prior measures are used to construct admissible procedures, by appeal to the characterization of admissible procedures as Bayesian procedures (or limits of Bayesian procedures) by Wald. For example, a right Haar measure for a family of distributions with a location parameter results in the Pitman estimator, which is best equivariant. When left and right Haar measures differ, the right measure is usually preferred as a prior distribution. For the group of affine transformations on the parameter space of the normal distribution, the right Haar measure is the Jeffreys prior measure. Unfortunately, even right Haar measures sometimes result in useless priors, which cannot be recommended for practical use, like other methods of constructing prior measures that avoid subjective information.

Another use of Haar measure in statistics is in conditional inference, in which the sampling distribution of a statistic is conditioned on another statistic of the data. In invariant-theoretic conditional inference, the sampling distribution is conditioned on an invariant of the group of transformations (with respect to which the Haar measure is defined). The result of conditioning sometimes depends on the order in which invariants are used and on the choice of a maximal invariant, so that by itself a statistical principle of invariance fails to select any unique best conditional statistic (if any exist); at least another principle is needed.

For non-compact groups, statisticians have extended Haar-measure results using amenable groups.

==Weil&#x27;s converse theorem==

In 1936, André Weil proved a converse (of sorts) to Haar&#x27;s theorem, by showing that if a group has a left invariant measure with a certain &quot;separating&quot; property, then one can define a topology on the group, and the completion of the group is locally compact and the given measure is essentially the same as the Haar measure on this completion.

<text>Viggo Brun (13 October 1885 – 15 August 1978) was a Norwegian professor, mathematician and number theorist.
==Contributions==
In 1915, he introduced a new method, based on Legendre&#x27;s version of the sieve of Eratosthenes, now known as the &quot;Brun sieve&quot;, which addresses additive problems such as Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture and the twin prime conjecture. He used it to prove that there exist infinitely many integers &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;n&quot; and &quot;n&quot;+2 have at most nine prime factors, and that all large even integers are the sum of two numbers with at most nine prime factors.

He also showed that the sum of the reciprocals of twin primes converges to a finite value, now called Brun&#x27;s constant: by contrast, the sum of the reciprocals of all primes is divergent. He developed a multi-dimensional continued fraction algorithm in 1919–1920 and applied this to problems in musical theory. He also served as praeses of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in 1946.

==Biography==
Brun was born at Lier in Buskerud, Norway. He studied at the University of Oslo and began research at the University of Göttingen in 1910. In 1923, Brun became a professor at the Technical University in Trondheim and in 1946 a professor at the University of Oslo.

He retired in 1955 at the age of 70 and died in 1978 (at 92 years-old) at Drøbak in Akershus, Norway.

<doc id="40648" wikidata="Q1799459" url="?curid=40648" title="Buffy Summers">
<text>Buffy Anne Summers is the title character of the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; franchise. She first appeared in the 1992 film &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; before going on to appear in The WB/UPN 1997–2003 television series and subsequent 1998–2018 Dark Horse and 2019–present Boom! Studios comic series of the same name. The character has also appeared in the spin-off series &quot;Angel&quot;, as well as numerous expanded universe materials such as novels and video games. Buffy was portrayed by Kristy Swanson in the film and by Sarah Michelle Gellar in the television series. Giselle Loren has lent her voice to the character in both the &quot;Buffy&quot; video games and an unproduced animated series, while Kelly Albanese lent her voice to the character in the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot; motion comics.

Buffy Summers is the protagonist of the series, which depicts her life and adventures as she grows up. In the film, she is a high school cheerleader who learns that she is the Slayer (a Chosen One gifted with the strength and skills to fight vampires and the forces of darkness, as a vampire hunter and demon hunter). The television series shows Buffy carrying out her destiny in the small town of Sunnydale, built atop a portal to hell (Hellmouth), surrounded by a group of friends and family who support her in her mission. In the comic book continuation, she is a young woman who has accepted her duties and is now responsible for training others like her.

Buffy was created by Joss Whedon to subvert the stereotypical female horror film victim—Whedon wanted to create a strong female cultural icon. In 2004, Buffy was ranked 13th on Bravo&#x27;s list of The 100 Greatest TV Characters. In June 2010, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked her third in its list of the 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years. AOL named her the sixth Most Memorable Female TV Character. She was ranked at No. 5 in AfterEllen.com&#x27;s Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. Buffy Summers is now view as one of the greatest and most iconic role of all time. 

==Appearances==

===Film===
The character of Buffy first appears in the 1992 film, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, played by Kristy Swanson. The film, written by Joss Whedon, depicts Buffy as a shallow high school cheerleader who is informed by a man named Merrick (Donald Sutherland) that she has been chosen by fate to battle the undead. Buffy reluctantly undergoes training in her abilities by Merrick, and as her responsibility as the Slayer causes her to become alienated from her valley girl peers, she finds friendship and romance with fellow outcast Pike (Luke Perry). Merrick eventually comes to respect Buffy&#x27;s rebellious nature, and she defeats vampire king Lothos (Rutger Hauer) by relying on her own contemporary style as opposed to traditional Slayer conventions. Although this film is not in continuity with the later television series, in 1999, author Christopher Golden adapted Joss Whedon&#x27;s original script into a comic book entitled &quot;The Origin&quot;, which Whedon later confirmed to be &quot;pretty much&quot; canonical.

On May 25, 2009, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; revealed Roy Lee and Doug Davison of Vertigo Entertainment would be working with Fran Rubel Kuzui and Kazi Kuzui on a relaunch of the &quot;Buffy&quot; series for the big screen. The series would not be a sequel or prequel to the existing movie or television franchise and Joss Whedon will have no involvement in the project. None of the cast or original characters from the television series will be featured. Television series executive producer Marti Noxon later reflected that this story might have been produced by the studio to frighten Joss into taking reins of the project. Studio interest in the project has continued, however. A script was rejected in 2011.

===Television===
Buffy returned in Joss Whedon&#x27;s television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, this time played by Sarah Michelle Gellar for all of the show&#x27;s 144 episodes. In season 1 (1997), Buffy begins to accept the responsibilities and dangers of her calling as the Slayer after moving to the small California town of Sunnydale. She becomes best friends with Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) and Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan), and meets her new Watcher, the school librarian, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head). Together they form the Scooby Gang, and work together to battle various supernatural occurrences which plague Sunnydale High. In the season finale, Buffy battles the vampiric villain known as the Master (Mark Metcalf), and is drowned in the process. She is resuscitated by Xander and rises to defeat the vampire lord.

In the show&#x27;s second season (1997–1998), Buffy continues to come to terms with her destiny, finds forbidden love with benevolent vampire Angel (David Boreanaz), and clashes with new villains Spike (James Marsters) and Drusilla (Juliet Landau). She also meets her Slayer replacement, Kendra (Bianca Lawson), who was called when Buffy was killed by the Master. Kendra is later killed by Drusilla, and the next replacement is seen in season 3. In the episode &quot;Surprise&quot;, Buffy loses her virginity to Angel, an event which triggers the loss of his soul and unleashes his sadistic alter-ego, Angelus. Angelus proceeds to subject the characters to mental and physical torture for the remainder of the season. In the final episode of season 2, Buffy is forced to reveal her identity as the Slayer to her mother (Kristine Sutherland), and send the newly good Angel to hell to save the world. She then leaves Sunnydale for Los Angeles in the hopes of escaping her life as the Slayer.

Season 3 (1998–1999) sees Buffy reconnect to her calling, her friends, and her family after her departure, as well as make difficult life decisions regarding her relationship with the resurrected Angel. She must also deal with the introduction of rebellious new Slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku), who becomes increasingly destructive and disloyal over the course of the season. In the season finale, Buffy stabs Faith in an attempt to save Angel&#x27;s life, and leads her classmates into a climactic battle against the demonic Mayor of Sunnydale (Harry Groener). Angel then leaves Sunnydale in hopes that Buffy can have a more normal life without him.

In the fourth season (1999–2000), Buffy balances her Slayer duties with her new life as a college student at UC Sunnydale. She experiences some difficulty adjusting to college life, and becomes increasingly disconnected from her friends, who all seem to be moving in different directions. Buffy eventually finds a new love interest in the form of Riley Finn (Marc Blucas), a soldier in the demon-hunting government task force known as The Initiative. She briefly joins forces with Riley&#x27;s team, until they discover one of the Initiative&#x27;s experiments, Adam (George Hertzberg), is creating an army of demon-human hybrids. Buffy unites with her friends to defeat Adam in a spell which invokes the power of the First Slayer. During &quot;Buffy&quot; season 4, Buffy also appears in the first season of spin-off series &quot;Angel&quot; (1999–2000), guest starring in the episodes &quot;I Will Remember You&quot; and &quot;Sanctuary&quot;.

In season 5 (2000–2001), Buffy battles the hell-goddess Glory (Clare Kramer), and fully embraces her destiny for the first time. A younger sister named Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) mysteriously appears in Buffy&#x27;s household, her existence having been seamlessly integrated with memories of the other characters. Buffy suffers emotional turmoil throughout this season, including the realization Dawn is not actually her sister, the deterioration of her relationship with Riley, the discovery that Spike has fallen obsessively in love with her, and her mother&#x27;s death from a brain aneurysm. She takes control of her destiny and duties, informing the Watchers&#x27; Council that &quot;they&quot; work for &quot;her&quot;, not the other way around; that their job is to supply her with whatever information she requires, immediately and fully. While on a quest to learn more about her nature as the Slayer, Buffy is told &quot;death is her gift&quot;, a message she has difficulty understanding until the episode &quot;The Gift&quot;, in which she sacrifices herself to save Dawn and the world by diving into Glory&#x27;s interdimensional portal and closing it.

Season 6 (2001–2002) depicts Buffy&#x27;s struggle with depression after her friends, believing she was trapped in a Hell dimension, performed a spell to bring her back from the dead; however, she was actually in Heaven, and feels great loss after being ripped out. Forced to take a mundane and degrading job slinging burgers at the Doublemeat Palace after realizing her family was in financial ruin, she sinks into a deep depression amid feelings of self-loathing and spends much of the season on a downward spiral alienating her friends and family and embarking on a violent sexual relationship with the vampire Spike which leaves neither satisfied and spawns dire consequences for the both of them. Aside from dealing with her emotional and psychological demons in this season, Buffy is continually targeted by a group calling themselves The Trio - Warren Mears (Adam Busch), Andrew Wells (Tom Lenk), and Jonathan Levinson (Danny Strong). Initially satisfied with only wreaking havoc for personal gain in Sunnydale, the Trio soon become bent on becoming powerful nemeses to the Slayer. At first, their activities are merely annoying to Buffy and the Scoobies, but Warren&#x27;s intentions become darker as the season goes on, and by the end Buffy is forced to deal with the Trio as the Slayer, while Andrew and Jonathan must come to grips with Warren&#x27;s betrayal against them. As the season draws to a close, Buffy is forced to battle her best friend when Willow becomes psychotic with dark magic after Warren shoots and kills Willow&#x27;s girlfriend Tara (Amber Benson) and wounds Buffy in the process. Willow then tries to destroy the world to end all suffering, although Xander gets through to her in the end. Buffy then promises to change her self-destructive behavior to be there for her sister.

In the final season of the show (2002–2003), things start to come around for Buffy when Principal Robin Wood (D. B. Woodside) hires her as a school counselor for the newly rebuilt Sunnydale High School and she has repaired her relationships with Dawn and her friends. However, she is also confronted with the threat of the First Evil and becomes a reluctant leader to the Potential Slayers, who are initially respectful of her, but become increasingly more alienated by her tactics and decisions throughout the season. She unexpectedly becomes emotionally close with Spike, who has sought out his soul in an effort to prove himself to her. In the show&#x27;s final episode &quot;Chosen&quot;, Buffy shares her power with her fellow Slayers before leading them into an epic battle against an army of Turok-Han vampires. She also confesses her love to a disbelieving Spike before he sacrifices himself to save the world; as he dies, Buffy escapes Sunnydale&#x27;s destruction with the surviving characters.

Following the end of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, the character maintains a presence in the fifth season of &quot;Angel&quot; (2003–2004), but does not appear onscreen. In the episode &quot;The Girl in Question&quot;, Angel and a resurrected Spike travel to Rome to find her, where they learn she is apparently now dating the Immortal. Sarah Michelle Gellar was approached to appear as Buffy in &quot;Angel&quot;&#x27;s one hundredth episode, but declined, so the character of Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter) was used instead. She was asked to appear in the second to last episode of the series, &quot;Power Play&quot;, but had to decline due to outside conflicts.

Between 2001 and 2004, Joss Whedon and Jeph Loeb developed a 4-minute pilot episode for &quot;Buffy the Animated Series&quot;, which was set during the show&#x27;s first season. Had the series been picked up by a network, the series would have focused upon Buffy (voiced by Giselle Loren) in more high-school adventures. Following a 2008 leak of the pilot to YouTube, Loeb expressed some hope the series may be resurrected in some form.

===Literature===

As the main character of the franchise, Buffy appears in almost all &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; literature. This includes a Dark Horse ongoing comic book and a series of novels. Buffy&#x27;s debut into literature came in the comic &quot;Dark Horse Presents 1998 Annual&quot; on August 26, 1998, while her first prose appearance was in &quot;Halloween Rain&quot; by Christopher Golden and Nancy Holder on October 5, 1998. Most of these stories occur between episodes and seasons of the television series, however, some are set outside the timeline of the show to explore in depth other areas of Buffy&#x27;s history. Christopher Golden adapted the film into a comic entitled &quot;The Origin&quot; (1999) which more closely resembles Joss Whedon&#x27;s original script. In 2003, Scott Lobdell and Fabian Nicieza wrote a Year One-style run on the &quot;Buffy&quot; comic book series which filled the gap between the film and the first season of the show. These stories explain how Buffy&#x27;s relationship with Pike ended, as well as fleshing out events alluded to in the television series, such as the time she spent in a mental institution and her parents&#x27; divorce. The novel &quot;Queen of the Slayers&quot; (2005) by Nancy Holder offers a potential follow-up to the television series; set after season 7, it depicts Buffy living in Italy with the morally ambiguous Immortal.

Buffy also makes appearances in literature outside of her own titular series. In the &quot;Tales of the Slayers&quot; comic one-shot &quot;Broken Bottle of Djinn&quot; (2002) by Doug Petrie and Jane Espenson, Buffy battles a spirit in Sunnydale High, while the &quot;Tales of the Vampires&quot; comic book story &quot;Antique&quot; (2004) by Drew Goddard sees her breaking into Dracula&#x27;s castle to rescue Xander from the infamous vampire. Volume II of the similar series of novels &quot;Tales of the Slayer&quot; (2003) features two stories about Buffy; the character battles a mummified spirit in Todd A. McIntosh&#x27;s &quot;All That You Do Comes Back Unto Thee&quot;, while Jane Espenson&#x27;s &quot;Again Sunnydale&quot; sees a season 6-era Buffy sent back in time to high school, when her mother is still alive but Dawn does not exist.

====Post-television &quot;Season&quot; continuations====

In 2007, Buffy&#x27;s story continued on from season 7 when Joss Whedon revived &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; as a comic book, again published by Dark Horse. Whedon differentiated these comics from previous &quot;Buffy&quot; literature, stating &quot;We could do something and for once we could make it canon. We could make it officially what happened after the end of the show.&quot; The continuation series emulates the structure of a television series, with five &quot;seasons&quot; published between 2007 and 2018 and Whedon overseeing multiple writers in the role of &quot;executive producer&quot;. 

In &quot;Season Eight&quot; (2007–2011), it is quickly established that Buffy is not living with the Immortal in Rome as previously suggested in &quot;Angel&quot;; this is simply a cover story to ensure her safety as she is now the leader of an army which recruits and trains Slayers to deal with demonic threats worldwide. However, a mysterious group led by the masked villain Twilight believe the Slayers themselves pose a danger to mankind and the natural order. In &quot;Wolves at the Gate&quot;, a lonely Buffy shares a sexual encounter with a younger Slayer Satsu; the relationship ends soon after when Satsu accepts that Buffy does not return her romantic feelings. The time travel story &quot;Time of Your Life&quot; acts as a crossover with &quot;Buffy&quot; spin-off &quot;Fray&quot;; Buffy is kidnapped two centuries into the future and meets her eventual successor Melaka Fray and Fray&#x27;s vampire twin brother Harth. These events have been orchestrated by a villainous future version of Willow, whom Buffy reluctantly kills to return home. The tensions between Buffy and Twilight&#x27;s respective armies eventually erupts into a full-scale war in Tibet; Twilight is unmasked as Angel being manipulated by enigmatic cosmic forces trying to destroy the universe and usher in a new dimension where Buffy and Angel will live together in paradise. However, Buffy rejects Twilight&#x27;s influence and saves her world by returning to the ruins of Sunnydale and smashing the Seed of Wonder, cutting Earth off from the source of all magic in the process. During these events, Buffy reunites with Spike, Giles is killed by a Twilight-controlled Angel, and the Slayer army is dissolved; Buffy moves to San Francisco with her friends to grieve their losses.

In contrast to the global scale of &quot;Season Eight&quot;, &quot;Season Nine&quot; (2011–2013) follows Buffy living a more grounded civilian life in San Francisco; she works in a local coffee shop and shares an apartment with roommates Anaheed and Tumble. Buffy is now a pariah in the supernatural community due to her destruction of magic and must deal with &quot;zompires&quot;, a feral new breed of vampires which have emerged since demons can no longer access Earth and fully possess human bodies. After getting blackout drunk at her housewarming party, Buffy has a pregnancy scare and turns to Spike for support when she decides to have an abortion; the pregnancy turns out to be a misunderstanding caused by Andrew, who switched Buffy&#x27;s body with a robot as part of a misguided plan to keep her safe. In &quot;Guarded&quot;, Buffy explores new career opportunities by temporarily joining Kennedy&#x27;s private security company Deepscan and shutting down TinCan, an interdimensional social media site run by long-term &quot;Angel&quot; villains Wolfram &amp; Hart. With most of her existing relationships strained, Buffy makes new allies in SFPD homicide detective Dowling and teenage vampire hunter Billy, and joins a magical council alongside demons D’Hoffryn and Illyria to battle the evil Slayer Simone and magic-siphoning Severin. When Dawn starts fading from existence due to the absence of magic, Buffy reunites with Willow and Xander in &quot;The Core&quot; to save her, journeying deep within the Earth to create a new Seed of Wonder and battling Maloker, an Old One and progenitor of all vampires, in the process. During &quot;Season Nine&quot;, Buffy also makes minor appearances in the spin-off comics &quot;Spike: A Dark Place&quot;, &quot;Willow: Wonderland&quot;, and &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot;.

Having restored magic to the world, &quot;Season Ten&quot; (2014–2016) picks up with Buffy and her friends reluctantly responsible for creating the laws governing it; Buffy must guard the ancient grimoire &quot;Vampyr&quot; in which the new laws of magic are formalized when recorded in the book. Some rules have already materialized without Buffy&#x27;s input (zompires are extinct and vampires now possess heightened strength and shapeshifting powers) and new rules tend to have unforeseen &quot;Monkey&#x27;s Paw&quot;-style consequences. Daunted and tempted by this new-found power, Buffy seeks the advice of D’Hoffryn and his magical council, as well as lobbyists from various mystical and demonic communities pursuing their own conflicting agendas. Meanwhile, Buffy and Spike&#x27;s decision to pursue an official romantic relationship is complicated by the manipulations of the demon Archaeus and the subsequent assistance by Angel; in the one-shot issue &quot;Triggers&quot;, Buffy expresses her repressed trauma over the sexual assault she experienced from soulless Spike back in the television episode &quot;Seeing Red&quot;. Following his resurrection in the spin-off series &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot;, Giles reunites with Buffy, and the paternal relationship they share is reaffirmed when Buffy&#x27;s father Hank excludes her from his wedding. D’Hoffryn eventually turns on Buffy and murders the rest of the council to seize the power of &quot;Vampyr&quot; for himself; finally accepting the responsibility she has been avoiding, Buffy outsmarts D’Hoffryn, commits to her relationship with Spike, and organizes her own council with whom to codify the laws of magic.

&quot;Season Eleven&quot; (2016–17) opens in disaster when a huge Shenlong dragon attacks San Francisco, killing thousands. In response to public outrage, the US President Malloy introduces the Supernatural Crisis Act, a set of new policies claiming to &quot;legalize and normalise&quot; the supernatural; this begins with a census and quickly leads to the relocation of magical individuals to the &quot;Safe Zone&quot;, an internment camp in the Grand Canyon. Buffy rejects an opportunity to join a Slayer peacekeeping force alongside the antagonistic Jordan, and instead opts to join Willow and Spike at the Safe Zone, where she does her best to maintain peace and protect innocent or harmless inmates. Buffy and Willow eventually agree to have their powers removed to leave the camp and further investigate the Pandora Project, a government conspiracy to drain and abuse magical energy; they expose White House Press Secretary Joanna Wise for summoning the Shenlong in the first place to put her plans in motion. Buffy briefly reabsorbs the power of all the Slayers in the world to battle the magic-infused Wise, but returns the power by the season&#x27;s final issue, warning a repentant Jordan not to misuse it.

In 2018, it was announced that Dark Horse was losing the license to publish &quot;Buffy&quot; comics; Joss Whedon&#x27;s intent for the final season was to &quot;give the Dark Horse era some closure&quot;. The four-issue &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Twelve: The Reckoning&quot; (2018) picks up one year after &quot;Season Eleven&quot;, with a thirty-year-old Buffy pondering her future; she is separated but on cordial terms with Spike, still working as a part-time police consultant, and a doting aunt to Dawn and Xander&#x27;s baby daughter Joyce. Tying up story elements first alluded to in 2001&#x27;s &quot;Fray&quot;, Buffy is warned about an apocalypse called &quot;the Reckoning&quot; led by time travelling vampire Harth, in which the Slayers are depowered and Buffy is banished to a hell dimension battling an army of demons. With help from her friends, and those of Angel and Fray, Buffy proactively takes the fight to Harth in an attempt to change her fate; Illyria sacrifices herself to banish the demons in Buffy&#x27;s place, altering history. After the battle, Buffy becomes a fulltime member of the SFPD supernatural division alongside Faith, reconnects with Spike, and comforts a grieving Angel over Illyria. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Buffy, Fray returns to the 23rd century to discover her world has been drastically improved by the continued presence of many Slayers.

====Boom! Studios reboot====
In 2019, Buffy was reinvented by Boom! Studios in their ongoing comic &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer.&quot; This series is a complete reboot and has no continuity with any previous stories; Buffy is depicted as a teenager in 2019 rather than the 1990s. She is already aware of her destiny as the Slayer and has been living in Sunnydale for only three weeks when the series begins. She befriends Willow and Xander after saving them from a vampire outside Tunaverse, the fast food restaurant where she works.

==Concept and creation==
An early influence for Buffy was Kelli Maroney&#x27;s character in the 1984 science-fiction horror film &quot;Night of the Comet&quot;. The character of Buffy was conceived by Joss Whedon as a way of subverting the cliché of &quot;the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror film&quot;. Whedon stated &quot;Rhonda the Immortal Waitress&quot; was the first incarnation of Buffy in his head, &quot;the idea of a seemingly insignificant female who in fact turns out to be extraordinary.&quot; When asked how he came up with the name of &quot;Buffy,&quot; Whedon states &quot;It was the name that I could think of that I could take the least seriously. There is no way you could hear the name Buffy and think, &#x27;This is an important person.&#x27; To juxtapose that with Vampire Slayer, just felt like that kind of thing—a B movie. But a B movie that had something more going on. That was my dream.&quot; Whedon claims the title was criticized for being too silly, and the television network begged him to change it. He refused, insisting &quot;You don&#x27;t understand. It has to be this. This is what it is.&quot; Jason Middleton feels that Buffy avoids the &quot;final girl&quot; character trope seen in horror films, where the androgynous and celibate heroine gets to outlive her friends and exact revenge on their killer; in Middleton&#x27;s words, &quot;she... gets to have sex with boys and &quot;still&quot; kill the monster&quot;.

Whedon always intended for the character to become an icon, claiming &quot;I wanted her to be a hero that existed in people&#x27;s minds the way Wonder Woman or Spider-Man does, you know? I wanted her to be a doll or an action figure. I wanted Barbie with Kung Fu grip! I wanted her to enter the mass consciousness and the imaginations of growing kids because I think she&#x27;s a cool character, and that was always the plan. I wanted Buffy to be a cultural phenomenon, period.&quot; In developing Buffy, Whedon was greatly inspired by Kitty Pryde, a character from the pages of the superhero comic &quot;X-Men&quot;. He admits, &quot;If there&#x27;s a bigger influence on Buffy than Kitty, I don&#x27;t know what it was... She was an adolescent girl finding out she has great power and dealing with it.&quot; In a 2009 interview, Whedon revealed he only recently realised how much he saw of himself in Buffy. After years of relating more to Xander, he says, &quot;Buffy was always the person that I was in that story because I&#x27;m not in every way.&quot; Whedon openly wonders why his identification figure is a woman, but describes it as &quot;a real autobiographical kind of therapy for me&quot; to be writing a strong female character like Buffy.

According to Whedon, Buffy &quot;had been brewing in [him] for many years&quot; before finally appearing in the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; film played by Kristy Swanson. However, he was not satisfied with the character&#x27;s treatment in the film, feeling &quot;that&#x27;s not quite her. It&#x27;s a start, but it&#x27;s not quite the girl.&quot; Although Whedon&#x27;s vision of female empowerment was not as apparent as he would have liked in the 1992 film, he was given a second chance when Gail Berman approached him with the idea of re-creating it as a television series. Adapting the concept of the movie into a television series, Whedon decided to reinvent the character of Buffy slightly. The shallow cheerleader of the original film had grown more mature and open-minded, identifying with social outcasts such as Willow and Xander, and instead, the character of Cordelia was created to embody what Buffy once was. Early in the television series, make-up supervisor Todd McIntosh was instructed to make Buffy &quot;a soft and sort of earthy character.&quot; He gave Gellar a soft, muted green make-up and kept her look very natural. However, it was later decided this was inappropriate for the character, and Buffy needed to look more like a valley girl. McIntosh switched her make-up around, giving her frosted eyeshadow and lip colors, bright turquoise and aqua marines, bubblegum colored nails, and bleach-blonde hair, causing the character to &quot;blossom.&quot;

== Legacy and Cultural Impact ==
Thanks to her groundbreaking role as Buffy, Sarah Michelle Gellar, by the late 1990s, had become a household name, as well as one of Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;It Girls&quot;. In 1998, she appeared on Entertainment Weekly&#x27;s Top 12 Entertainers of the Year and the &quot;Most Beautiful&quot; list by People magazine. In 1999, she signed on to be the face of Maybelline —becoming the company&#x27;s first celebrity spokeswoman since Lynda Carter in the late 1970s— and was voted number one in FHM&#x27;s &quot;100 Sexiest Women&quot; of the year. She was featured in the magazine&#x27;s German, Dutch, South African, Danish and Romanian editions of the list since 1998. Topsocialite.com listed her as the 8th Sexiest woman of the 1990s. 

The character of Buffy became a cultural icon, inspiring plenty of others female characters. Marie- Claire Chappet wrote in her article published for Harper&#x27;s Bazaar &quot;Her witty comebacks, her high-kicks, her strength. Everything about her was mesmerising. I had seen female warriors before – in superhero cartoons or even Star Wars – but something about the way the show was otherwise grounded in a rather mundane high-school reality, made this startlingly affective.&quot;, quoting Buffy as a feminine icon. CBS News developped a theory called the &quot;Buffy Effect&quot;, analyzing the impact of the character on strong woman on television. Theory followed by Lindsay Abrams writing for The Atlantic &quot;The &quot;Buffy effect&quot; posits that strong characters can combat the negative effects of sexual violence in media.&quot;

Buffy has been acclaimed by viewers and critique for being badass while still being &quot;girly&quot; and relatable. The Hollywood Reporter placed Buffy Summers at No.3 in the top &quot; Hollywood&#x27;s Favorite Female Characters&quot;. and placed No.1 for the website Digital Spy quoting &quot;But Buffy Summers was the hero in her own story. And if she could be, then I could be too. Throughout its seven-season run, audiences grew along with Buffy and many of its most impactful moments can apply to all sorts of things that real life might throw at you – whatever your age, or your struggle.&quot; Vox stated that Buffy &quot;subverts one of pop culture’s most famous tropes.&quot; following this statement by &quot;As comics and YA fans will be quick to attest, Buffy wasn’t pop culture’s first female superhero, not by a long shot. But she was the first to anchor her own TV series, and her success paved the way for others like her.&quot;

Kadeen Griffiths of &quot;Bustle&quot; insists on how Gellar&#x27;s Buffy Summers influenced quippy, strong female characters such as Veronica Mars from &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, Rory Gilmore from &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, Elena Gilbert from &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot;, Hope Mikaelson from &quot;The Originals&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Legacies&quot; etc. Kadeen Griffiths wrote : &quot;And San Diego Comic-Con 2015 had an entire panel called &quot;The Buffy Effect: Teen Heroines Then and Now,&quot; in which authors like Kiersten White (And I Darken) and Rae Carson (Walk The Earth a Stranger) cited the show as a key inspiration in how they wrote their female characters.&quot; Bob Schooley called Buffy Summers a huge influence on the creation of the character Kim Possible. Kristen Bell&#x27;s work is often compared to Sarah Michelle Gellar&#x27;s portrayal of the title character on the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Hollywood Reporter writing &quot; arguably the television successor to Sarah Michelle Gellar&#x27;s Buffy the Vampire Slayer when it comes to fighting bad guys.&quot;

Buffy&#x27;s name became a synonym for strong woman, as we can see in fiction when characters refers to woman trying to fight or having physical fight ( Heroes: &quot;Strange Attractors&quot; (2010) — Becky tells Claire: &quot;You don&#x27;t have to go all &#x27;Buffy&#x27; on us.&quot;).
The romance of the protagonist with the two vampires Angel and Spike have been known to have redefined the supernatural romance, inspiring romances in &quot;Twilight&quot;, &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot;, &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;, &quot;True Blood&quot; etc.

<text>In zoology, a scale (; ) is a small rigid plate that grows out of an animal&#x27;s skin to provide protection. In lepidopterans (butterflies and moths), scales are plates on the surface of the insect wing, and provide coloration. Scales are quite common and have evolved multiple times through convergent evolution, with varying structure and function.

Scales are generally classified as part of an organism&#x27;s integumentary system. There are various types of scales according to the shape and class of an animal.

==Fish scales==
Fish scales are dermally derived, specifically in the mesoderm. This fact distinguishes them from reptile scales paleontologically.
Genetically, the same genes involved in tooth and hair development in mammals are also involved in scale development.

===Cosmoid scales===
True cosmoid scales can only be found on the Sarcopterygians. The inner layer of the scale is made of lamellar bone. On top of this lies a layer of spongy or vascular bone and then a layer of dentine-like material called cosmine. The upper surface is keratin. The coelacanth has modified cosmoid scales that lack cosmine and are thinner than true cosmoid scales.

===Ganoid scales===
Ganoid scales can be found on gars (family Lepisosteidae), bichirs, and reedfishes (family Polypteridae). Ganoid scales are similar to cosmoid scales, but a layer of ganoin lies over the cosmine layer and under the enamel. Ganoin scales are diamond shaped, shiny, and hard. 
Within the ganoin are guanine compounds, iridescent derivatives of guanine found in a DNA molecule. The iridescent property of these chemicals provide the ganoin its shine.

===Placoid scales===

Placoid scales are found on cartilaginous fish including sharks and stingrays. These scales, also called denticles, are similar in structure to teeth, and have one median spine and two lateral spines. The modern jawed fish ancestors, the jawless ostracoderms and later jawed placoderms, may have had scales with the properties of both placoid and ganoid scales.

===Leptoid scales===
Leptoid scales are found on higher-order bony fish. As they grow they add concentric layers. They are arranged so as to overlap in a head-to-tail direction, like roof tiles, allowing a smoother flow of water over the body and therefore reducing drag. They come in two forms:
*Cycloid scales have a smooth outer edge, and are most common on fish with soft fin rays, such as salmon and carp.
*Ctenoid scales have a toothed outer edge, and are usually found on fish with spiny fin rays, such as bass and crappie.

==Reptilian scales==

Reptile scale types include: cycloid, granular (which appear bumpy), and keeled (which have a center ridge). Scales usually vary in size, the stouter, larger scales cover parts that are often exposed to physical stress (usually the feet, tail and head), while scales are small around the joints for flexibility. Most snakes have extra broad scales on the belly, each scale covering the belly from side to side.

The scales of all reptiles have an epidermal component (what one sees on the surface), but many reptiles, such as crocodilians and turtles, have osteoderms underlying the epidermal scale. Such scales are more properly termed scutes. Snakes, tuataras and many lizards lack osteoderms. All reptilian scales have a dermal papilla underlying the epidermal part, and it is there that the osteoderms, if present, would be formed.

Many reptiles possess large scales not supported by osteoderms known as feature scales. The green iguana possesses large feature scales on the ventral sides of its neck, and dorsal spines not supported by osteoderms. Many extinct non-avian dinosaurs such as Carnotaurus and Brachylophosaurus are known to possess feature scales from skin impressions.

==Avian scales==

Birds&#x27; scales are found mainly on the toes and metatarsus, but may be found further up on the ankle in some birds. The scales and scutes of birds were thought to be homologous to those of reptiles, but are now agreed to have evolved independently, being degenerate feathers.

Carcharodontosaurid theropod dinosaur Concavenator, is known to have possessed these feather-derived tarsal scutes.

==Mammalian scales==

An example of a scaled mammal is the pangolin. Its scales are made of keratin and are used for protection, similar to an armadillo&#x27;s armor. They have been convergently evolved, being unrelated to mammals&#x27; distant reptile-like ancestors (since therapsids lost scales), except that they use a similar gene.

On the other hand, the musky rat-kangaroo has scales on its feet and tail. The precise nature of its purported scales has not been studied in detail, but they appear to be structurally different from pangolin scales.

Anomalures also have scales on their tail undersides.

Foot pad epidermal tissues in most mammal species have been compared to the scales of other vertebrates. They are likely derived from cornification processes or stunted fur much like avian reticulae are derived from stunted feathers.

==Arthropod scales==

Butterflies and moths - the order Lepidoptera (Greek &quot;scale-winged&quot;) - have membranous wings covered in delicate, powdery scales, which are modified setae. Each scale consists of a series of tiny stacked platelets of organic material, and butterflies tend to have the scales broad and flattened, while moths tend to have the scales narrower and more hair like. Scales are usually pigmented, but some types of scales are iridescent, without pigments; because the thickness of the platelets is on the same order as the wavelength of visible light the plates lead to structural coloration and iridescence through the physical phenomenon described as thin-film optics. The most common color produced in this fashion is blue, such as in the &quot;Morpho&quot; butterflies.

Some types of spiders also have scales. Spider scales are flattened setae that overlay the surface of the cuticle. They come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. At least 13 different spider families are known to possess cuticular scales, although they have only been well described for jumping spiders (Salticidae) and lynx spiders (Oxyopidae). 

Some crustaceans such as &quot;Glyptonotus antarcticus&quot; have knobbly scales. Some crayfish have been shown to use antennal scales that are activated in rapid response movements.

<text>In music theory, a scale is &quot;any consecutive series of notes that form a progression between one note and its octave&quot;, typically by order of pitch or fundamental frequency. 

The word &quot;scale&quot; originates from the Latin &quot;scala&quot;, which literally means &quot;ladder&quot;. Therefore, any scale is distinguishable by its &quot;step-pattern&quot;, or how its intervals interact with each other. 

Often, especially in the context of the common practice period, most or all of the melody and harmony of a musical work is built using the notes of a single scale, which can be conveniently represented on a staff with a standard key signature.

Due to the principle of octave equivalence, scales are generally considered to span a single octave, with higher or lower octaves simply repeating the pattern. A musical scale represents a division of the octave space into a certain number of scale steps, a scale step being the recognizable distance (or interval) between two successive notes of the scale. However, there is no need for scale steps to be equal within any scale and, particularly as demonstrated by microtonal music, there is no limit to how many notes can be injected within any given musical interval.

A measure of the width of each scale step provides a method to classify scales. For instance, in a chromatic scale each scale step represents a semitone interval, while a major scale is defined by the interval pattern W–W–H–W–W–W–H, where W stands for whole step (an interval spanning two semitones, e.g. from C to D), and H stands for half-step (e.g. from C to D). Based on their interval patterns, scales are put into categories including pentatonic, diatonic, chromatic, major, minor, and others.

A specific scale is defined by its characteristic interval pattern and by a special note, known as its first degree (or tonic). The tonic of a scale is the note selected as the beginning of the octave, and therefore as the beginning of the adopted interval pattern. Typically, the name of the scale specifies both its tonic and its interval pattern. For example, C major indicates a major scale with a C tonic.

==Background==

===Scales, steps, and intervals===

Scales are typically listed from low to high pitch. Most scales are &quot;octave-repeating&quot;, meaning their pattern of notes is the same in every octave (the Bohlen–Pierce scale is one exception). An octave-repeating scale can be represented as a circular arrangement of pitch classes, ordered by increasing (or decreasing) pitch class. For instance, the increasing C major scale is C–D–E–F–G–A–B–[C], with the bracket indicating that the last note is an octave higher than the first note, and the decreasing C major scale is C–B–A–G–F–E–D–[C], with the bracket indicating an octave lower than the first note in the scale.

The distance between two successive notes in a scale is called a scale step.

The notes of a scale are numbered by their steps from the first degree of the scale. For example, in a C major scale the first note is C, the second D, the third E and so on. Two notes can also be numbered in relation to each other: C and E create an interval of a third (in this case a major third); D and F also create a third (in this case a minor third).

===Pitch===
A single scale can be manifested at many different pitch levels. For example, a C major scale can be started at C4 (middle C; see scientific pitch notation) and ascending an octave to C5; or it could be started at C6, ascending an octave to C7.

===Types of scale===
Scales may be described according to the number of different pitch classes they contain:

* Chromatic, or dodecatonic (12 notes per octave)
*Nonatonic (9 notes per octave): a chromatic variation of the heptatonic blues scale
* Octatonic (8 notes per octave): used in jazz and modern classical music
* Heptatonic (7 notes per octave): the most common modern Western scale
* Hexatonic (6 notes per octave): common in Western folk music
* Pentatonic (5 notes per octave): the anhemitonic form (lacking semitones) is common in folk music, especially in Asian music; also known as the &quot;black note&quot; scale
* Tetratonic (4 notes), tritonic (3 notes), and ditonic (2 notes): generally limited to prehistoric (&quot;primitive&quot;) music
Scales may also be described by their constituent intervals, such as being hemitonic, cohemitonic, or having imperfections. Many music theorists concur that the constituent intervals of a scale have a large role in the cognitive perception of its sonority, or tonal character.

&quot;The number of the notes that make up a scale as well as the quality of the intervals between successive notes of the scale help to give the music of a culture area its peculiar sound quality.&quot; &quot;The pitch distances or intervals among the notes of a scale tell us more about the sound of the music than does the mere number of tones.&quot;

Scales may also be described by their symmetry, such as being palindromic, chiral, or having rotational symmetry as in Messiaen&#x27;s modes of limited transposition.

===Harmonic content===
The notes of a scale form intervals with each of the other notes of the chord in combination. A 5-note scale has 10 of these harmonic intervals, a 6-note scale has 15, a 7-note scale has 21, an 8-note scale has 28. Though the scale is not a chord, and might never be heard more than one note at a time, still the absence, presence, and placement of certain key intervals plays a large part in the sound of the scale, the natural movement of melody within the scale, and the selection of chords taken naturally from the scale.

A musical scale that contains tritones is called tritonic (though the expression is also used for any scale with just three notes per octave, whether or not it includes a tritone), and one without tritones is &quot;atritonic&quot;. A scale or chord that contains semitones is called hemitonic, and without semitones is anhemitonic.

===Scales in composition===
Scales can be abstracted from performance or composition. They are also often used precompositionally to guide or limit a composition. Explicit instruction in scales has been part of compositional training for many centuries. One or more scales may be used in a composition, such as in Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Isle Joyeuse&quot;. To the right, the first scale is a whole-tone scale, while the second and third scales are diatonic scales. All three are used in the opening pages of Debussy&#x27;s piece.

==Western music==

Scales in traditional Western music generally consist of seven notes and repeat at the octave. Notes in the commonly used scales (see just below) are separated by whole and half step intervals of &quot;tones&quot; and &quot;semitones.&quot; The harmonic minor scale includes a three-semitone step; the anhemitonic pentatonic includes two of those and no semitones.

Western music in the Medieval and Renaissance periods (1100–1600) tends to use the white-note diatonic scale C–D–E–F–G–A–B. Accidentals are rare, and somewhat unsystematically used, often to avoid the tritone.

Music of the common practice periods (1600–1900) uses three types of scale:
* The diatonic scale (seven notes)—this includes the major scale and the natural minor
* The melodic and harmonic minor scales (seven notes)

These scales are used in all of their transpositions. The music of this period introduces &quot;modulation,&quot; which involves systematic changes from one scale to another. Modulation occurs in relatively conventionalized ways. For example, major-mode pieces typically begin in a &quot;tonic&quot; diatonic scale and modulate to the &quot;dominant&quot; scale a fifth above.
In the 19th century (to a certain extent), but more in the 20th century, additional types of scales were explored:

* The chromatic scale (twelve notes)
* The whole-tone scale (six notes)
* The pentatonic scale (five notes)
* The octatonic or diminished scales (eight notes)
A large variety of other scales exists, some of the more common being:

* The Phrygian dominant scale (a mode of the harmonic minor scale)
* The Arabic scales
* The Hungarian minor scale
* The Byzantine music scales (called echoi)
* The Persian scale
Scales such as the pentatonic scale may be considered &quot;gapped&quot; relative to the diatonic scale. An &quot;auxiliary scale&quot; is a scale other than the primary or original scale. See: modulation (music) and Auxiliary diminished scale.

==Note names==
In many musical circumstances, a specific note of the scale is chosen as the tonic—the central and most stable note of the scale. In Western tonal music, simple songs or pieces typically start and end on the tonic note. Relative to a choice of a certain tonic, the notes of a scale are often labeled with numbers recording how many scale steps above the tonic they are. For example, the notes of the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) can be labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, reflecting the choice of C as tonic. The expression scale degree refers to these numerical labels. Such labeling requires the choice of a &quot;first&quot; note; hence scale-degree labels are not intrinsic to the scale itself, but rather to its modes. For example, if we choose A as tonic, then we can label the notes of the C major scale using A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, and so on. When we do so, we create a new scale called the A minor scale. See the musical note article for how the notes are customarily named in different countries.

The scale degrees of a heptatonic (7-note) scale can also be named using the terms tonic, supertonic, mediant, subdominant, dominant, submediant, subtonic. If the subtonic is a semitone away from the tonic, then it is usually called the leading-tone (or leading-note); otherwise the leading-tone refers to the raised subtonic. Also commonly used is the (movable do) solfège naming convention in which each scale degree is denoted by a syllable. In the major scale, the solfège syllables are: do, re, mi, fa, so (or sol), la, ti (or si), do (or ut).

In naming the notes of a scale, it is customary that each scale degree be assigned its own letter name: for example, the A major scale is written A–B–C–D–E–F–G rather than A–B–D–D–E–E–G. However, it is impossible to do this in scales that contain more than seven notes, at least in the English-language nomenclature system.

Scales may also be identified by using a binary system of twelve zeros or ones to represent each of the twelve notes of a chromatic scale. The most common binary numbering scheme defines lower pitches to have lower numeric value (as opposed to low pitches having a high numeric value). Thus a single pitch class n in the pitch class set is represented by 2^n. This maps the entire power set of all pitch class sets in 12-TET to the numbers 0 to 4095. The binary digits read as ascending pitches from right to left, which some find discombobulating because they are used to low to high reading left to right, as on a piano keyboard. In this scheme, the major scale is 101010110101 = 2741. This binary representation permits easy calculation of interval vectors and common tones, using logical binary operators. It also provides a perfect index for every possible combination of tones, as every scale has its own number.

Scales may also be shown as semitones from the tonic. For instance, 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 denotes any major scale such as C–D–E–F–G–A–B, in which the first degree is, obviously, 0 semitones from the tonic (and therefore coincides with it), the second is 2 semitones from the tonic, the third is 4 semitones from the tonic, and so on. Again, this implies that the notes are drawn from a chromatic scale tuned with 12-tone equal temperament. For some fretted string instruments, such as the guitar and the bass guitar, scales can be notated in tabulature, an approach which indicates the fret number and string upon which each scale degree is played.

==Transposition and modulation==

Composers transform musical patterns by moving every note in the pattern by a constant number of scale steps: thus, in the C major scale, the pattern C–D–E might be shifted up, or transposed, a single scale step to become D–E–F. This process is called &quot;scalar transposition&quot; or &quot;shifting to a new key&quot; and can often be found in musical sequences and patterns. (It is D–E–F in Chromatic transposition). Since the steps of a scale can have various sizes, this process introduces subtle melodic and harmonic variation into the music. In Western tonal music, the simplest and most common type of modulation (or changing keys) is to shift from one major key to another key built on the first key&#x27;s fifth (or dominant) scale degree. In the key of C major, this would involve moving to the key of G major (which uses an F). Composers also often modulate to other related keys. In some Romantic music era pieces and contemporary music, composers modulate to &quot;remote keys&quot; that are not related to or close to the tonic. An example of a remote modulation would be taking a song that begins in C major and modulating (changing keys) to F major.

==Jazz and blues==

Through the introduction of blue notes, jazz and blues employ scale intervals smaller than a semitone. The blue note is an interval that is technically neither major nor minor but &quot;in the middle&quot;, giving it a characteristic flavour. A regular piano cannot play blue notes, but with electric guitar, saxophone, trombone and trumpet, performers can &quot;bend&quot; notes a fraction of a tone sharp or flat to create blue notes. For instance, in the key of E, the blue note would be either a note between G and G or a note moving between both.

In blues, a pentatonic scale is often used. In jazz, many different modes and scales are used, often within the same piece of music. Chromatic scales are common, especially in modern jazz.

==Non-Western scales==
===Equal temperament===
In Western music, scale notes are often separated by equally tempered tones or semitones, creating 12 intervals per octave. Each interval separates two tones; the higher tone has an oscillation frequency of a fixed ratio (by a factor equal to the twelfth root of two, or approximately 1.059463) higher than the frequency of the lower one. A scale uses a subset consisting typically of 7 of these 12 as scale steps.

===Other===
Many other musical traditions use scales that include other intervals. These scales originate within the derivation of the harmonic series. Musical intervals are complementary values of the harmonic overtones series. Many musical scales in the world are based on this system, except most of the musical scales from Indonesia and the Indochina Peninsulae, which are based on inharmonic resonance of the dominant metalophone and xylophone instruments.

===Intra-scale intervals===
Some scales use a different number of pitches. A common scale in Eastern music is the pentatonic scale, which consists of five notes that span an octave. For example, in the Chinese culture, the pentatonic scale is usually used for folk music and consists of C, D, E, G and A, commonly known as gong, shang, jue, chi and yu.

Some scales span part of an octave; several such short scales are typically combined to form a scale spanning a full octave or more, and usually called with a third name of its own. The Turkish and Middle Eastern music has around a dozen such basic short scales that are combined to form hundreds of full-octave spanning scales. Among these scales Hejaz scale has one scale step spanning 14 intervals (of the middle eastern type found 53 in an octave) roughly similar to 3 semitones (of the western type found 12 in an octave), while Saba scale, another of these middle eastern scales, has 3 consecutive scale steps within 14 commas, i.e. separated by roughly one western semitone either side of the middle tone.

Gamelan music uses a small variety of scales including Pélog and Sléndro, none including equally tempered nor harmonic intervals. Indian classical music uses a moveable seven-note scale. Indian Rāgas often use intervals smaller than a semitone. Turkish music Turkish makams and Arabic music maqamat may use quarter tone intervals. In both rāgas and maqamat, the distance between a note and an inflection (e.g., śruti) of that same note may be less than a semitone.

<text>Leigh Douglass Brackett (December 7, 1915 – March 24, 1978) was an American author and screenwriter. Nicknamed &quot;the Queen of Space Opera,&quot; she was one of the most prominent female writers during the Golden Age of Science Fiction. As a screenwriter, she was best known for her collaborations with director Howard Hawks, mainly writing Westerns and crime films. She also worked on an early draft of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), elements of which remained in the film; she died before it went into production. 

In 1956, her book &quot;The Long Tomorrow&quot; made her the first woman ever shortlisted for the Hugo Award for Best Novel, and, along with C. L. Moore, one of the first two women ever nominated for a Hugo Award. In 2020, she posthumously won a Retro Hugo for her novel &quot;The Nemesis From Terra&quot;, originally published as &quot;Shadow Over Mars&quot; (&quot;Startling Stories&quot;, Fall 1944).

==Early life and education==
Leigh Brackett was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. Her father died when she was very young; her mother did not remarry. She was a tomboy, &quot;tall&quot; and &quot;athletic&quot;. She attended a private girls&#x27; school in Santa Monica, California, where she was involved in theater and began writing.

==Career==

===Fiction writer===
Brackett first published in her mid-20s; the science fiction story &quot;Martian Quest&quot; appeared in the February 1940 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;. Her earliest years as a writer (1940–1942) were her most productive. Some of her stories have social themes, such as &quot;The Citadel of Lost Ships&quot; (1943), which considers the effects on alien cultures of Earth&#x27;s expanding trade empire. At the time, she was an active member of the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society (LASFS), and participated in local science fiction fandom by contributing to the second issue of &quot;Pogo&#x27;s STF-ETTE&quot;, an all-female science fiction fanzine (probably the first such).

Brackett&#x27;s first novel, &quot;No Good from a Corpse&quot; (1944), was a hard-boiled mystery novel in the tradition of Raymond Chandler. The book led to her first big screenwriting assignment. After this, Brackett&#x27;s science fiction stories became more ambitious. &quot;Shadow Over Mars&quot; (1944) was her first novel-length story; though rough-edged, it marked the beginning of a new style influenced by the characterization of the 1940s detective story and film noir. It won a Retro Hugo for best novel in 2020.

&quot;Planet Stories&quot; published the novella &quot;Lorelei of the Red Mist&quot;, in which the protagonist is a thief named Hugh Starke. Brackett finished the first half before turning it over to her close friend Ray Bradbury, so that she could leave to work on the screenplay of &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;.

Brackett returned to science fiction writing in 1948 after her movie work. Between 1948 and 1951, she produced a series of science fiction adventure stories that were longer than her previous work, including classic representations of her planetary settings as &quot;The Moon that Vanished&quot; and the novel &quot;Sea-Kings of Mars&quot; (1949). The latter was later published as &quot;The Sword of Rhiannon&quot;.

In &quot;Queen of the Martian Catacombs&quot; (1949), Brackett created the character of Eric John Stark. Stark, an orphan from Earth, is raised by the semi-sentient aboriginals of Mercury, who are later killed by Earthmen. He is saved by a Terran official, who adopts and mentors Stark. When threatened, Stark reverts to the primitive N&#x27;Chaka, the &quot;man without a tribe&quot;, who he was on Mercury. From 1949 to 1951, Brackett featured Stark (whose name echoes that of the hero in &quot;Lorelei of the Red Mist&quot;) in three stories published in &quot;Planet Stories&quot;: &quot;Queen of the Martian Catacombs&quot;, &quot;Enchantress of Venus&quot;, and &quot;Black Amazon of Mars&quot;. With this last story, Brackett&#x27;s high adventure period ended.

Brackett adopted an elegiac tone in her stories, no longer celebrating the conflicts of frontier worlds but lamenting the passing of civilizations, and concentrating more on mood than plot. The stories&#x27; reflective, introspective nature is indicated in the titles: &quot;The Last Days of Shandakor&quot;, &quot;Shannach—the Last&quot;, and &quot;Last Call from Sector 9G&quot;.

&quot;Last Call&quot; was published in the final issue (Summer 1955) of &quot;Planet Stories&quot;, which had been her most reliable publisher. After &quot;Planet Stories&quot; folded, and then &quot;Startling Stories&quot; and &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot;, Brackett lost her magazine market. The first phase of her career as a science fiction author ended. She produced other stories over the next decade, and revised and published some as novels. A new production of this period was &quot;The Long Tomorrow&quot; (1955), one of Brackett&#x27;s more critically acclaimed novels. It describes an agrarian, technophobic society that develops after a nuclear war.

After 1955, Brackett concentrated on writing for the more lucrative film and television markets. In 1963 and 1964, she briefly returned to her old Martian milieu with a pair of stories. &quot;The Road to Sinharat&quot; was an affectionate farewell to the world of &quot;Queen of the Martian Catacombs&quot;, and the other, with the intentionally ridiculous title of &quot;Purple Priestess of the Mad Moon&quot;, borders on parody.

Brackett and her husband shared Guest of Honor duties at the 22nd World Science Fiction Convention in 1965 in Oakland, California.

After another decade-long hiatus, Brackett returned to science fiction in the 1970s with the publication of &quot;The Ginger Star&quot; (1974), &quot;The Hounds of Skaith&quot; (1974), and &quot;The Reavers of Skaith&quot; (1976), collected as &quot;The Book of Skaith&quot; in 1976. This trilogy brought Eric John Stark back for adventures on the extra-solar planet of Skaith (rather than his old haunts, Mars and Venus).

====Brackett&#x27;s solar system====
Often called the &quot;Queen of Space Opera&quot;, Brackett also wrote planetary romance. Almost all her planetary romances take place in the solar system, which contains richly detailed fictional versions of the consensus Mars and Venus of science fiction from the 1930s to the 1950s. Mars appears as a marginally habitable desert world, populated by ancient, decadent and mostly humanoid races, and Venus as a primitive, wet jungle planet, occupied by vigorous, primitive tribes and reptilian monsters. Brackett&#x27;s Skaith combines elements of her other worlds with fantasy elements.

Though Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; influence is apparent in Brackett&#x27;s Mars stories, her Mars is set firmly in a world of interplanetary commerce and competition. A prominent theme of her stories is the clash of planetary civilizations; they illustrate and criticize the effects of colonialism on civilizations that are either older or younger than those of the colonizers. Burroughs&#x27; heroes set out to remake entire worlds according to their own codes; Brackett&#x27;s heroes (often antiheroes) are at the mercy of trends and movements far bigger than they are.

After the Mariner missions indicated there was no life on Mars, Brackett never returned to her solar system. When she started to write planetary romance again in the 1970s, she invented a new solar system outside our own.

===Screenwriter===
Shortly after Brackett broke into science fiction writing, she wrote her first screenplays. Hollywood director Howard Hawks was so impressed by her novel &quot;No Good from a Corpse&quot; that he had his secretary call in &quot;this guy Brackett&quot; to help William Faulkner write the script for &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1946). The film was written by Brackett, Faulkner, and Jules Furthman, and starred Humphrey Bogart.

After getting married, Brackett took a break from screenwriting. When she returned to screenwriting in the mid-1950s, she wrote for TV and movies. Howard Hawks hired her to write or co-write several John Wayne pictures, including &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; (1959), &quot;Hatari!&quot; (1962), &quot;El Dorado&quot; (1966), and &quot;Rio Lobo&quot; (1970). Because of her background with &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, she later adapted Raymond Chandler&#x27;s novel &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; for the screen.

====&quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;====
Brackett worked on the screenplay for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; sequel. The film won the Hugo Award in 1981. This script was a departure for Brackett; until then, all her science fiction had been in the form of novels and short stories. George Lucas said that he asked Brackett to write the screenplay based on his story outline. Brackett wrote a finished first draft, titled &quot;&quot;Star Wars&quot; sequel&quot;, that was delivered to Lucas shortly before her death from cancer on March 18, 1978, but her version was rejected and Lucas wrote two drafts of a new screenplay and, following the delivery of the screenplay for &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, turned them over to Lawrence Kasdan to rework some dialogue. Brackett and Kasdan (but not Lucas) were credited for the final screenplay. Brackett was credited in tribute despite not being involved in the final film.

Laurent Bouzereau, in &quot;Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays&quot;, said that Lucas disliked the direction of Brackett&#x27;s screenplay, discarded it, and produced two more screenplays before turning the results over to Kasdan. io9&#x27;s co-founder Charlie Jane Anders has written that while &quot;It&#x27;s fashionable to disparage Brackett&#x27;s contributions to &quot;Empire&quot;&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s not true that none of Brackett&#x27;s storyline winds up in the final movie—the basic story beats are the same.&quot;

For over 30 years, Brackett&#x27;s screenplay could be read only at the Jack Williamson Special Collections library at Eastern New Mexico University in Portales, New Mexico, and at Lucasfilm&#x27;s archives in California. It was officially published in February 2016. In this draft, there is a love triangle between Luke, Leia and Han Solo. Yoda is named Minch, Luke has a hidden sister named Nellith, Lando Calrissian is Lando Kaddar, Luke&#x27;s father is still a distinct character from Darth Vader and appears as a Force ghost on Dagobah, and Han Solo, at the end of the script, leaves to search for his uncle Ovan Marek, the most powerful man in the universe after the Emperor Palpatine.

John Saavedra of Den of Geek website wrote:
==Personal life and death==
On December 31, 1946, at age 31, Brackett married another science fiction writer, Edmond Hamilton, in San Gabriel, California. Fellow LASFS member Ray Bradbury served as best man. Bradbury and Robert Heinlein were longtime close friends of Brackett&#x27;s. She moved with Hamilton to Kinsman, Ohio.

Edmond Hamilton died in February 1977 in Lancaster, California, of complications following kidney surgery. Brackett died there in March 1978, of cancer, at age 62.

<text>The 13th century BC was the period from 1300 to 1201 BC.

==The world in the 13th century BC==

==Events==
===Asia===
* c. 1300–1046 BC: in China, the Shang dynasty flourishes as it settles its capital, Yin, near Anyang. Chinese settlers swarm in compact groups to create new clearing areas towards the Yangtze basin in the south, the Shanxi terraces in the northwest and the Wei River valley. The Shang then seem to frequently wage war with the still non-Sinicized populations who inhabit the Huai River valley. Graves in the form of cruciform pits have been discovered in Anyang containing chariots with their yokes, numerous bronze vases and the remains of human sacrifices, as well as the first Chinese inscriptions on oracle bones (&quot;Jiaguwen&quot;) or bronze vases. China&#x27;s Shang armies are organized into infantry and archers in companies of one hundred men, supporting sections of five chariots.
* c. 1300 BC: the Aryans dominate northwest India as far as the Sarasvati River. The Vedas mention the &quot;Dasas&quot; (slaves) as their enemies. Dasas are interpreted as being a North Iranian tribe, Dahae. The Aryans are organized in tribal monarchies headed by a raja (king), who shares power with two councils or assemblies that will differentiate over time, the sabhā (court of justice) and the samiti (council of war). Only one raja is named in the Rigveda: Sudas of the Bharatas, a tribe established on the upper reaches of the Sarasvatî. He is described as the victor of the coalition of ten kings, the most powerful of which was Pûru. Subsequently, the Kurus take control of the Bharatas.
* c. 1260 BC: Lapita pottery discovered at the Bourewa site southwest of Viti Levu dates back to this period.

===Middle East===
* c. 1350–1210 BC: the Igihalkid dynasty in Elam. They resume the title of &quot;Kings of Anshan and Susa&quot;.
* c. 1306–1186 BC: the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt. Memphis, then Pi-Ramesses, are the capitals of the New Kingdom of Egypt. It is a period of relative prosperity. During the reign of Ramesses II, the construction of the Great Hypostyle Hall of the temples of Karnak, the Luxor Temple and the temples of Abu Simbel are completed.
* 1307–1275 BC: the first Assyrian mention of the &quot;Ahlamu&quot;, proto-Aramaic people, during the reign of Adad-nirari I, in the region of the north of the Euphrates. The Aramaeans, a Semitic people reported from the 14th century BC by the archives of Amarna and then Ugarit, settled in North Mesopotamia, then in Aram (now Syria) and Lebanon where they formed kingdoms in the 11th century BC. The biblical tradition of the sons of Jacob, apparently originating from the Aram Naharayim or &quot;Aram of the two rivers&quot;, in the loop of the Euphrates, around the towns of Harran and Nahur, seems to confirm that this region was populated by Proto-Aramaic pastors around the 13th century BC.
* 1274 BCE: the Egyptian and Hittite Empires clash in the Battle of Kadesh, with heavy losses to each side but no decisive outcome.
* 1207 BC: Merneptah repels attacks by northern invaders (the &quot;Sea-Peoples&quot;) in the 8th year of his reign, according to the Great Karnak Inscription. Eric Cline closely links this event with the beginning of the Late Bronze Age collapse.

===Europe===
* c. 1300–1200 BC: Bronze IIIB in Greece. The Lion Gate and the Treasury of Atreus are built in Mycenae. It is a time of peace and prosperity in the Aegean. Mycenaean imports to the Levant peak. A wreck found on the southern coast of Anatolia contained ingots of copper, tin, ivory, Syrian, Cypriot and Mycenaean vases, and pieces of elephant and hippo ivory. The Acropolis of Athens is developed: towards the end of the century, a Cyclopean wall four to six meters thick, known as the “pelasgic wall” (&quot;Pelargikon&quot;), is constructed, as well as a well to supply the citadel with water. Linear B tablets are created in Pylos.
*c. 1300–1200 BC: approximately 4,000 men fight a battle at a causeway over the Tollense valley in Northern Germany, the largest known prehistoric battle north of the Alps.
* c. 1300–500 BC: the Lusatian culture in Poland, parts of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, eastern Germany and northern Ukraine.
* c. 1250–850 BC: the Urnfield culture, characterized by vast cemeteries housing urns with the ashes of the deceased and offerings, marks the Late Bronze Age in Western Europe.
* c. 1250–1000 BC: the culture of Pantalica develops inland in Sicily.
* 1225–1190 BC: Late Helladic IIIB2 in mainland Greece. The perimeters of the defense systems of the Mycenaean palaces (Mycenae, Tiryns, Midea) are widely extended, a sign that insecurity is increasing. The end of the period was marked by widespread destruction on most sites: Mycenae, Tyrinth, Midéa, Thebes, Orchomenus, Dimini, and Pylos, whose unfortified palaces have not been rebuilt.

<text>The Kingsbury Commitment is a 1913 out-of-court settlement of the United States government&#x27;s antitrust challenge against the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) for the company&#x27;s then-growing vertical monopoly in the telecommunications industry. In return for the government&#x27;s agreement not to pursue legal action against the company as a monopolist, AT&amp;T agreed to divest the controlling interest it had acquired in the Western Union Telegraph Company, and to allow non-competing independent telephone companies to interconnect with the AT&amp;T long-distance network.

==History==
In 1907, Theodore N. Vail became president of AT&amp;T for the second time. Immediately, he steered the company into a new direction, in terms of vision, company organization, and technology. He envisioned telephone service as a public utility, and the future of the American telephone industry as a unified system of companies under the lead of his company. This required technical standards understood and accepted by all players in the industry. He opened the market for the Western Electric Company, its manufacturing unit which the company had previously restricted to sell products only to the Bell System companies, so that independent operators could buy compatible apparatus. He organized a distinct research division within Western Electric to focus on basic research and development. AT&amp;T had bought Bell-associated companies and organized them into new hierarchies. AT&amp;T had also acquired many of the independents, and bought control of Western Union, giving it a monopolistic position in both telephone and telegraph communication. These efforts and Vail&#x27;s vision were communicated to the public by marketing campaigns under the slogan &quot;One System — One Policy — Universal Service&quot;. 

AT&amp;T increasingly became a vertically integrated conglomerate. The government had been increasingly worried that AT&amp;T and the other Bell companies were monopolizing the industry. A key strategy by the Bell System was to refuse to connect its long-distance network—technologically, by far the finest and most extensive in the nation—with independent carriers. Without the prospect of long-distance services, the market position of many independent operators became untenable. AT&amp;T&#x27;s strategies prompted complaints and attracted the attention of the Justice Department.

==Agreement==
Faced with a government investigation and a possible suit for antitrust violations, AT&amp;T entered into negotiations that carried on for several months in 1913. The conclusion came in form of a voluntary commitment in form of a letter by AT&amp;T&#x27;s Vice President Nathan Kingsbury, who secured approval by executives and the government representatives before submittal. In the letter, dated December 19, 1913, AT&amp;T agreed with Attorney General James Clark McReynolds to divest itself of Western Union, to provide long-distance services to independent exchanges under certain conditions, and to refrain from acquisitions if the Interstate Commerce Commission objected. Justice Department officials opined that the plan gave the government everything and more than they could have hoped to obtain in court, and it found the approval of President Woodrow Wilson, who expressed his admiration for the attitude and vision of the telephone company:

The Commitment did not settle all differences between independents and Bell companies, but it did avert the federal takeover many had expected. AT&amp;T was allowed to buy market-share, as long as it sold an equal number of subscribers to independents. Crucially, while the Kingsbury Commitment obliged it to connect its long-distance service to independent local carriers, AT&amp;T did not agree to interconnect its local services with other local providers. Nor did AT&amp;T agree to any interconnection with independent long-distance carriers. AT&amp;T&#x27;s connection with the Western Electric Company was not addressed and the independent manufacturers still could not sell into Bell&#x27;s market place, but operators had to buy Bell equipment for &quot;standard trunks&quot; to be able to connect to the Long Lines network.

==Continued monopoly==
Consequently, AT&amp;T was able to consolidate its control over both the most profitable urban markets and long-distance traffic.

All telephone networks in the United States were nationalized during World War I from June 1918 to July 1919. Following re-privatization, AT&amp;T resumed its near-monopoly position. The Willis Graham Act of 1921 allowed AT&amp;T to acquire more local telephone systems with the genial oversight of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), effectively declaring the telephone business as a natural monopoly. By 1924, the ICC approved AT&amp;T&#x27;s acquisition of 223 of the 234 independent telephone companies. Between 1921 and 1934, the ICC approved 271 of the 274 purchase requests of AT&amp;T. With the creation of the Federal Communications Commission by the Communications Act of 1934, the government regulated the rates charged by AT&amp;T.

In 1956, AT&amp;T and the Justice Department agreed on a consent decree to end an antitrust suit brought against AT&amp;T in 1949. Under the decree, AT&amp;T restricted its activities to those related to running the national telephone system and agreed to license patents it had developed without royalties.

In 1968, FCC regulators intervened when the Bell System tried to prevent a mobile communications system, the Carterfone, from connecting to telephone lines. That decision established the principle that customers could connect any lawful device to the telephone network, even to offer a competing service. In the mid 1970s, emerging long-distance competitors like MCI and Sprint faced the same tactic of denying interconnection, which regulators quashed, followed by a series of efforts by the Bell System phone companies to escalate the costs of interconnection as an indirect means of excluding competition. These battles resulted a large amount of antitrust litigation and ultimately led to the 1982 breakup of the Bell System.

In 1982, AT&amp;T and the Justice Department agreed on tentative terms for settlement of antitrust suit filed against AT&amp;T in 1974, under which AT&amp;T divested itself of its local telephone operations, which became known as the &quot;Baby Bells.&quot; In return, the Justice Department agreed to lift the restrictions on AT&amp;T activities contained in the 1956 consent decree.

<text>In musical notation, an accidental is a symbol that indicates an alteration of a given pitch. The most common accidentals are the flat () and the sharp (), which represent alterations of a semitone, and the natural (), which cancels a sharp or flat. Accidentals alter the pitch of individual scale tones in a given key signature; the sharps or flats in the key signature itself are not considered accidentals.

An accidental applies to the note that immediately follows it, and to subsequent instances of that note in the same measure unless it is canceled by another accidental. A sharp raises a note&#x27;s pitch by a semitone and a flat lowers it by a semitone. Double flats () or sharps () may also be used, which alter the unmodified note by two semitones. If a note with an accidental is tied, the accidental continues to apply, even if the note it is tied to is in the next measure. If a note has an accidental and the note is repeated in a different octave within the same measure the accidental is usually repeated, although this convention is not universal.

The modern accidental signs derive from the two forms of the lower-case letter &quot;b&quot; used in Gregorian chant manuscripts to signify the two pitches of B, the only note that could be altered. The &quot;round&quot; &quot;b&quot; became the flat sign, while the &quot;square&quot; &quot;b&quot; diverged into the sharp and natural signs.

==Standard use==
In most cases, a sharp raises the pitch of a note one semitone while a flat lowers it one semitone. A natural is used to cancel the effect of a flat or sharp. This system of accidentals operates in conjunction with the key signature, whose effect continues throughout an entire piece, or until another key signature is indicated. An accidental can also be used to cancel a previous accidental or reinstate the flats or sharps of the key signature.

Accidentals apply to subsequent notes on the same staff position for the remainder of the measure where they occur, unless explicitly changed by another accidental. Once a barline is passed, the effect of the accidental ends, except when a note affected by an accidental is tied to the same note across a barline. An accidental that carries past the barline through a tied note does not apply to subsequent notes.

:&lt;score&gt; {
 \relative c&quot; {
 \time 3/4
 g4 gis gis | g? ges ges~ | ges gis g
}
&lt;/score&gt;

Under this system, the notes in the example above are:

* 1: G, G, G (the sharp carries over)
* m. 2: G (with courtesy accidental), G, G (the flat carries over)
* m. 3: G (which is tied from the previous note), G, G (the natural sign cancels the sharp sign)

Though this convention is still in use particularly in tonal music, it may be cumbersome in music that features frequent accidentals, as is often the case in atonal music. As a result, an alternative system of note-for-note accidentals has been adopted, with the aim of reducing the number of accidentals required to notate a bar. According to Kurt Stone, the system is as follows:

# Accidentals affect only those notes which they immediately precede.
# Accidentals are not repeated on tied notes unless the tie goes from line to line or page to page.
# Accidentals are not repeated for repeated notes unless one or more different pitches (or rests) intervene.
# If a sharp or flat pitch is followed directly by its natural form, a natural is used.
# Courtesy accidentals or naturals (in parentheses) may be used to clarify ambiguities but are kept to a minimum

Because seven of the twelve notes of the chromatic equal-tempered scale are naturals (the &quot;white notes&quot;, A; B; C; D; E; F; and G on a piano keyboard) this system can significantly reduce the number of naturals required in a notated passage.

Occasionally, an accidental may change the note by more than a semitone: for example, if a G is followed in the same measure by a G, the flat sign on the latter note means it is two semitones lower than if no accidental were present. Thus, the effect of the accidental must be understood in relation to the &quot;natural&quot; meaning of the note&#x27;s staff position.

In some atonal scores (particularly by composers of the Second Viennese School), an accidental is notated on every note, including natural notes and repeated pitches. This system was adopted for &quot;the specific intellectual reason that a note with an accidental was not simply an inflected version of a natural note but a pitch of equal status.&quot;

==Double flats and sharps==

Double flats or sharps lower or raise or the pitch of a note by two semitones. An F double sharp is a whole step above an F, making it enharmonically equivalent to a G. These alterations apply to the note as if it were a &quot;natural&quot;, regardless of the key signature (see the F in measure 2 of the Chopin example below).

If a note with a double sharp or double flat is followed by a note in the same position with a single sharp or single flat, there are two common notations. Modern notation simply uses a single flat or sharp sign on the second note, whereas older notation may use a natural sign (to cancel the double accidental) combined with the single accidental (shown below). Changing a note with a double accidental to a natural may likewise be done with a single natural sign (modern) or with a double natural (older).

 \time 3/2
 cisis2_&quot;Older Practice&quot; cis cisis\accidentalStyle modern cisis_&quot;Modern Practice&quot; cis cisis
&lt;/score&gt;

Only a few instances of triple flats () or triple sharps () can be found. As expected, they alter a note by three semitones (one whole tone and one semitone).

==Courtesy accidentals==

In modern scores, a barline cancels an accidental, with the exception of tied notes. &quot;Courtesy accidentals&quot;, also called &quot;cautionary accidentals&quot; or &quot;reminder accidentals&quot; are used to remind the musician of the correct pitch if the same note occurs in the following measure. The rules for applying courtesy accidentals (sometimes enclosed in parentheses) vary among publishers, though in a few situations they are customary:

* When the first note of a measure had an accidental in the previous measure
* After a tie carries an accidental across a barline, and the same note appears in the next measure
* When a chord contains a diminished or augmented octave
* When there is a cross relation with another part

Publishers of free jazz music and some atonal music sometimes eschew all courtesy accidentals.

==Microtonal notation==
Composers of microtonal music have developed a number of notations for indicating the various pitches outside of standard notation. One such system for notating quarter tones, used by the Czech Alois Hába and other composers, is shown.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, when Turkish musicians switched from their traditional notation systems—which were not staff-based—to the European staff-based system, they refined the European accidental system so they could notate Turkish scales that use intervals smaller than a tempered semitone. There are several such systems, which vary as to how they divide the octave they presuppose or the graphical shape of the accidentals. The most widely used system (created by Rauf Yekta Bey) uses a system of four sharps (roughly +25 cents, +75 cents, +125 cents and +175 cents) and four flats (roughly −25 cents, −75 cents, −125 cents and −175 cents), none of which correspond to the tempered sharp and flat. They presuppose a Pythagorean division of the octave taking the Pythagorean comma (about an eighth of the tempered tone, actually closer to 24 cents, defined as the difference between seven octaves and 12 just-intonation fifths) as the basic interval. The Turkish systems have also been adopted by some Arab musicians.

Ben Johnston created a system of notation for pieces in just intonation where the unmarked C, F, and G major chords are just major chords (4:5:6) and accidentals create just tuning in other keys. Between 2000 and 2003, Wolfgang von Schweinitz and Marc Sabat developed the Extended Helmholtz-Ellis Just Intonation (JI) pitch notation, a modern adaptation and extension of the notation principles first used by Hermann von Helmholtz, Arthur von Oettingen, and Alexander John Ellis that some other musicians use for notating extended just intonation.

== History of notation ==
The three principal symbols indicating whether a note should be raised or lowered in pitch are derived from variations of the small letter &quot;b&quot;: the sharp () and natural () signs from the square &quot;b quadratum&quot;, and the flat sign () from the round &quot;b rotundum&quot;.

The different kinds of B were eventually written differently, so as to distinguish them in music theory treatises and in notation. The flat sign derives from a round &quot;b&quot; that signified the soft hexachord, &quot;hexachordum molle&quot;, particularly the presence of B. The name of the flat sign in French is &quot;bémol&quot; from medieval French &quot;bé mol&quot;, which in modern French is &quot;bé mou&quot; (&quot;soft b&quot;). The natural sign and the sharp sign derive from variations of a square &quot;b&quot; that signified the hard hexachord, &quot;hexachordum durum&quot;, where the note in question is B. The name of the natural sign in French is &quot;bécarre&quot; from medieval French &quot;bé quarre&quot;, which in modern French is &quot;bé carré&quot; (&quot;square b&quot;). In German music notation, the letter &quot;B&quot; or &quot;b&quot; always designates B while the letter &quot;H&quot; or &quot;h&quot; – a deformation of a square &quot;b&quot; – designates B.

In the High Middle Ages, a widespread musical tradition was based on the hexachord system defined by Guido of Arezzo. The basic system, called &quot;musica recta&quot;, had three overlapping hexachords. Change from one hexachord to another was possible, called a &quot;mutation&quot;. A major problem with the system was that mutation from one hexachord to another could introduce intervals like the tritone that musicians of the time considered undesirable. To avoid the dissonance, a practice called musica ficta arose from the late 12th century onward. This introduced modifications of the hexachord, so that &quot;false&quot; or &quot;feigned&quot; notes could be sung, partly to avoid dissonance. At first only B could be flattened, moving from the &quot;hexachordum durum&quot; (the &quot;hard hexachord&quot;) G–A–B–C–D–E where B is natural, to the &quot;hexachordum molle&quot; (the &quot;soft hexachord&quot;) F–G–A–B–C–D where it is flat. The note B is not present in the third hexachord &quot;hexachordum naturale&quot; (the &quot;natural hexachord&quot;) C–D–E–F–G–A.

Strictly speaking the medieval signs and indicated that the melody is progressing inside a (fictive) &quot;hexachord&quot; of which the signed note is the &quot;mi&quot; or the &quot;fa&quot; respectively. That means they refer to a group of notes &quot;around&quot; the marked note, rather than indicating that the note itself is necessarily an accidental. For example, when a semitone relationship is indicated between F and G, either by placing a mi-sign () on F or a fa-sign () on G, only the context can determine whether this means, in modern terms, F-G or F-G, or even F–G. The use of either the mi-sign on F or the fa-sign on G means only that &quot;some kind of F goes to some kind of G, proceeding by a semitone&quot;.

As polyphony became more complex, notes other than B required alteration to avoid undesirable harmonic or melodic intervals (especially the augmented fourth, or tritone, that music theory writers referred to as &quot;diabolus in musica&quot;, i.e., &quot;the devil in music&quot;). Nowadays &quot;ficta&quot; is used loosely to describe any such un-notated accidentals. The implied alterations can have more than one solution, but sometimes the intended pitches can be found in lute tablatures where a fret is specified.

The convention of an accidental remaining in force through a measure developed only gradually over the 18th century. Before then, accidentals only applied to immediately repeated notes or short groups when the composer felt it was obvious that the accidental should continue. The older practice continued in use well into the 18th century by many composers, notably Johann Sebastian Bach. The newer convention did not achieve general currency until early in the 19th century.

<text>The American goldfinch (Spinus tristis) is a small North American bird in the finch family. It is migratory, ranging from mid-Alberta to North Carolina during the breeding season, and from just south of the Canada–United States border to Mexico during the winter.

The only finch in its subfamily to undergo a complete molt, the American goldfinch displays sexual dichromatism: the male is a vibrant yellow in the summer and an olive color during the winter, while the female is a dull yellow-brown shade which brightens only slightly during the summer. The male displays brightly colored plumage during the breeding season to attract a mate.

The American goldfinch is a granivore and adapted for the consumption of seedheads, with a conical beak to remove the seeds and agile feet to grip the stems of seedheads while feeding. It is a social bird and will gather in large flocks while feeding and migrating. It may behave territorially during nest construction, but this aggression is short-lived. Its breeding season is tied to the peak of food supply, beginning in late July, which is relatively late in the year for a finch. This species is generally monogamous and produces one brood each year.

Human activity has generally benefited the American goldfinch. It is often found in residential areas because it is attracted to bird feeders, which increase its survival rate in these areas. Deforestation also creates open meadow areas, which are its preferred habitat.

The American goldfinch was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his work, &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, where he classified it in the genus &quot;Fringilla&quot;. It was later placed in the genus &quot;Spinus&quot;, a group containing New World goldfinches and siskins. In 1976, &quot;Spinus&quot; was merged into the genus &quot;Carduelis&quot; as a subgenus. Recent studies have resurrected the genus &quot;Spinus&quot;. Its closest relatives are the lesser goldfinch (&quot;S. psaltria&quot;), Lawrence&#x27;s goldfinch (&quot;S. lawrencei&quot;), and the siskins. Although it shares a name with the European goldfinch, the two are in separate genera and are not closely related. &quot;Carduelis&quot; is derived from &quot;carduus&quot;, the Latin word for &#x27;thistle&#x27;; the species name &quot;tristis&quot; is Latin for &#x27;sorrowful&#x27;. There are four recognized subspecies of the American goldfinch:
*The eastern goldfinch (&quot;S. t. tristis&quot;) is the most common of the subspecies. Its summer range is from southern Canada to Colorado, and east to the Carolinas. Its winter range is from southern Canada south to Florida and central Mexico.
*The pale goldfinch (&quot;S. t. pallidus&quot;) is differentiated from other subspecies by its paler body color, stronger white markings and, in males, a larger black cap. It is slightly larger than &quot;S. t. tristis&quot;. The summer range is from British Columbia to western Ontario, south to Colorado and west to Oregon. In winter, the range extends from southern Canada and northern California, south to Mexico.
*The northwestern goldfinch (&quot;S. t. jewetti&quot;) is smaller and darker than the other subspecies. It occurs on the coastal slope of the Cascade Mountains from southern British Columbia to central California, overlapping with the range of &quot;S. t. pallidus&quot;.
*The willow goldfinch (&quot;S. t. salicamans&quot;) occurs west of the Sierra Nevada range during the summer and in the central and southern Baja California Peninsula to the Mojave Desert and the Colorado Desert in the winter. In winter, the plumage of both sexes is browner than the other subspecies and in summer, the male&#x27;s black cap is smaller than that of the other subspecies.

==Description==
The American goldfinch is a small finch, long, with a wingspan of . It weighs between . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the culmen is and the tarsus is . The beak is small, conical, and pink for most of the year, but turns bright orange with the spring molt in both sexes.
The shape and size of the beak aid in the extraction of seeds from the seed heads of thistles, sunflowers, and other plants.

The American goldfinch undergoes a molt in the spring and autumn. It is the only cardueline finch to undergo molting twice a year. During the winter molt it sheds all its feathers; in the spring, it sheds all but the wing and tail feathers, which are dark brown in the female and black in the male. The markings on these feathers remain through each molt, with bars on the wings and white under and at the edges of the short, notched tail. The sexual dimorphism displayed in plumage coloration is especially pronounced after the spring molt, when the bright color of the male&#x27;s summer plumage is needed to attract a mate.

Once the spring molt is complete, the body of the male is a brilliant lemon yellow, a color produced by carotenoid pigments from plant materials in its diet, with a striking jet black cap and white rump that is visible during flight. The female is mostly brown, lighter on the underside with a yellow bib. After the autumn molt, the bright summer feathers are replaced by duller plumage, becoming buff below and olive-brown above, with a pale yellow face and bib. The autumn plumage is almost identical in both sexes, but the male has yellow shoulder patches.

The immature bird has a dull brown back, and the underside is pale yellow. The shoulders and tail are a dull black with buff-colored, rather than white, markings on wings and rump. This coloration is the same in both sexes.

The song is a series of musical warbles and twitters, often with a long note. A &quot;tsee-tsi-tsi-tsit&quot; call is often given in flight; it may also be described as &quot;per-chic-o-ree&quot;. While the female incubates the eggs, she calls to her returning mate with a soft continuous &quot;tee-tee-tee-tee-tee&quot; sound. The young begin to use a call of &quot;chick-kee&quot; or &quot;chick-wee&quot; shortly before fledging, which they use until they have left the nest entirely. There are two defense calls made by adults during nesting; a &quot;sweet&quot; call made to rally other goldfinches to the nest and distract predators, and a &quot;bearbee&quot; used to signal to the nestlings to quiet them and get them to crouch down in the nest to become less conspicuous.

==Distribution and habitat==

The American goldfinch prefers open country where weeds thrive, such as fields, meadows, flood plains, as well as roadsides, orchards, and gardens. It may also be found in open deciduous and riparian woodlands and areas of secondary growth. This habitat preference continues during the spring and autumn migrations.

The summer breeding range stretches across North America from coast to coast. It is bounded on the north by Saskatchewan and stretches south across North America to North Carolina on the east coast, and northern California on the west coast. The American goldfinch is a short-distance migrant, moving south in response to colder weather and lessened food supply. According to ornithologist Marc Parnell, this responsive, southerly migratory pattern is thought to begin to occur as daily low temperatures approach freezing, and particularly as these temperatures near 0 °F. The migration is completed in compact flocks, which travel in an erratic, wavelike flight pattern.

Its winter range includes southern Canada and stretches south through the United States to parts of Mexico. In winter, in the northern part of its range, the finch may move nearer to feeders if they are available. In southern ranges, during winter, they remain in areas like fields and flood plains where they live during the summer months.

Attempts were made to introduce the American goldfinch into Bermuda in the 19th century and Tahiti in 1938, but the species failed to become established in either place.

==Behavior==

The American goldfinch flies in a distinctive undulating pattern, creating a wave-shaped path. This normally consists of a series of wing beats to lift the bird, then folding in the wings and gliding in an arc before repeating the pattern. Birds often vocalize during the flapping phase of the pattern and then go silent during the coasting phase. The call made during flight is &quot;per-twee-twee-twee&quot;, or &quot;ti-di-di-di&quot;, punctuated by the silent periods. They communicate with several distinct vocalizations, including one that sounds like &quot;po-ta-to-chip&quot; to the listener.

Birds do not act aggressively toward predators within their territory; their only reaction is alarm calling. Predators include snakes, weasels, squirrels, and blue jays, which may destroy eggs or kill young, and hawks and cats, which pose a threat to both young and adults. The oldest known American goldfinch was 10 years and 5 months old.

===Sociality===

The American goldfinch is gregarious during the nonbreeding season when it is often found in large flocks, usually with other finches. The social hierarchy, measured by how many aggressive encounters are won by each individual, tends towards the male being dominant in the nonbreeding season. During the breeding season, this finch lives in loose colonies. While the nest is being constructed, the male will act aggressively toward other males who intrude into his territory, driving them away, and the female reacts in the same way toward other females. This aggressiveness subsides once the eggs have been laid. The social hierarchy in the breeding season generally has the female dominant over the male. Dominance may change based on the value of a resource; a study published in 1987 found that starved subordinate birds were sometimes dominant in competitions over feeder access.
Birds indicate their level of aggression through a range of displays. The head-up display, where the neck and legs are slightly extended, shows mild aggression and is often performed by the victor of an encounter. The carpals-raised display has the neck retracted and the carpals raised; displayers are likely to attack their opponent. The head-forward display is where the legs are flexed, the neck extended, and the beak closed. At higher intensities, the neck is lowered, the beak is pointed at the opponent, and one or both wings are raised. In extreme cases, the neck is retracted, the bill opened, the body feathers sleeked, and the tail is fanned and raised slightly. Aggression is also displayed by showing the front of the body to another individual. Attacks include pecking at feathers, supplanting the opponent by landing next to it, and flying vertically with legs and feet extended, beaks open, and necks extended. Avoidance behaviors include showing only the side of the body to an aggressor, leaning away, and flexing the legs, retracting the neck, and pointing the beak down.

===Breeding===
The breeding season begins later in the year than for any other finch and later than any other native North American bird, besides occasionally the sedge wren. This may be related to the abundance of seeds in the late summer months, as seeds represent most of their diet.

The courtship rituals include aerial maneuvers and singing by males, who begin courtship in late July. The flight displays begin as the male pursues the female, who flies in zigzagging evasive patterns. The male can signal his quality and fitness, both in the short term (current body condition) and long term (genes), through ornamentation (bill color and plumage). If a female accepts the male as a mate, the pair will fly in wide circles, as the male warbles throughout the flight.

Once a male has found a mate, he selects a territory, marking the boundaries by warbling as he flies from perch to perch. After circling the perimeter, he performs two flight displays, first repeating a low, flat flight, then flying in an exaggerated version of normal flight, tucking his wings close to his body, plummeting earthwards and catching himself as he spreads his wings to glide upward in a series of loops. Two or three pairs may group their territories together in a loose colony, perhaps to aid in defense against predators.
The nest is built in late summer by the female in the branches of a deciduous shrub or tree at a height of up to . The nest-building lasts approximately six days, during which time the female works in 10–40 minute increments. The male frequently flies with the female as she collects nesting materials, and though he may carry some materials back to the nest, he leaves its construction to the female. The outer shell of the nest is built of bark, weeds, vines, and grass. The inside diameter of the finished nest is about . The rim is reinforced with bark bound by spiderwebs and caterpillar silk, and the cup is lined with plant down from milkweed, thistle, or cattail. The nest is so tightly woven that it can hold water, and it is possible for nestlings to drown following a rainstorm if the parents do not cover the nest.

The clutch is four to six bluish-white eggs, which are oval in shape and about , roughly the size of a peanut. It is thought that they are laid during the night. The eggs are incubated by the female alone, though the male brings her food as she nests, and most mating pairs raise only one brood each year.

The chicks hatch 12–14 days after incubation begins. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial; they are hatched naked, with reddish bodies, pale grey down, and closed eyes. The mother bird feeds her young regurgitated seeds and insects as they grow. The hatchlings develop quickly, opening their eyes after three days, and completing the growth of olive-brown juvenile plumage after 11–15 days, at which time they begin to practice short flights close to the nest. For up to three weeks after fledging, they are still fed by the male, who locates them by listening for their fledging call. The chicks stop giving this call when they become entirely independent.

The American goldfinch is occasionally victim to brood parasites, particularly brown-headed cowbirds. One study found that 9% of nests had brown-headed cowbird eggs in them. It likely evades parasitism partly because of its late breeding season. The American goldfinch also makes a very poor host for brood parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of brown-headed cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is despite the lack of known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites in this finch. It is thought that the inability of brown-headed cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough nutrition; the seed-rich diet of American goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.

===Feeding===
The American goldfinch is a diurnal feeder. According to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the species is one of the strictest vegetarians in the bird world. It is mainly granivorous, but will occasionally eat insects, which are also fed to its young to provide protein. Its diet consists of the seeds from a wide variety of plants, often those of weeds, grasses, and trees, such as thistle, teasel, dandelion, ragweed, mullein, cosmos, goatsbeard, sunflower, and alder. However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, and berries. It will eat at bird feeders provided by humans, particularly in the winter months, preferring Niger seed (commonly and erroneously called thistle seed).

Unlike some finch species, the American goldfinch uses its feet extensively in feeding. It frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding to reach the seeds more easily. In the spring, the American goldfinch feeds on the catkins hanging from birches and alders by pulling one up with its beak and using its toes to hold the catkin still against the branch. This dexterity enables it to take advantage of food sources relatively inaccessible to potential competitors, increasing its chances of survival.

== Status ==
The American goldfinch has a large range, with an estimated global extent of about and an increasing population. The species is evaluated as least concern on the 2016 IUCN Red List.

==Relationship with humans==
The American goldfinch is found in residential areas throughout its range. Backyard birders attract it using feeders containing niger seed, or by planting grasses and perennial plants, such as zinnias, cosmos, bee balm, or globe thistle, which produce seedheads favored by finches.

The American goldfinch is not threatened by human activity and is widespread throughout its range. The clearing of forests by humans, though harmful to many species, has benefited the American goldfinch. Clearing of woodlands causes declines in numbers of neotropical migrants while favoring short-distance migrants and permanent residents. This benefits the American goldfinch both because it is a short-distance migrant and because the created open areas are the preferred environment of the bird, where weeds thrive which produce the primary food source of the American goldfinch.

==State bird==

The American goldfinch is the state bird of Iowa and New Jersey, where it is called the eastern goldfinch, and Washington, where it is called the willow goldfinch. It was chosen by schoolchildren in Washington in 1951.

<text>Meissen (, ), is a town of approximately 30,000 about northwest of Dresden on both banks of the Elbe river in the Free State of Saxony, in eastern Germany. Meissen is the home of Meissen porcelain, the Albrechtsburg castle, the Gothic Meissen Cathedral and the Meissen Frauenkirche. The &quot;Große Kreisstadt&quot; is the capital of the Meissen district.

==History==

It grew out of the early West Slavic settlement of &quot;Miśni&quot; inhabited by Glomatians and was founded as a German town by King Henry the Fowler in 929. In 968, the Diocese of Meissen was founded, and Meissen became the episcopal see of a bishop. The Catholic bishopric was suppressed in 1581 after the diocese accepted the Protestant Reformation (1559), but re-created in 1921 with its seat first at Bautzen and now at the Katholische Hofkirche in Dresden.

In 965, the Margraviate of Meissen, a frontier march of the Holy Roman Empire, was founded, with Meissen as its capital. A market town by 1000, Meissen passed to the Duchy of Poland in 1002 under Boleslaw I the Brave, afterwards into hands of Henry II a few months later and to the House of Wettin in 1089. In 1015, Meissen was besieged by the Poles led by future King Mieszko II.

In 1241, the town was attacked in the Mongol raid on Meissen. The small Mongol force under Orda Khan defeated Meissens&#x27;s defenders and much of the town was destroyed. The Mongols withdrew from Germany after the death of Ögedei Khan, sparing the region from further destruction.

The town was at the forefront of the Ostsiedlung, or intensive German settlement of the rural Slavic lands east of the Elbe, and its reception of town rights dates to 1332.

The construction of Meissen Cathedral was begun in 1260 on the same hill as the Albrechtsburg castle. The resulting lack of space led to the cathedral being one of the smallest cathedrals in Europe. The church is also known as being one of the purest examples of Gothic architecture.

In 1423, Meissen became capital of the Electorate of Saxony. In 1464, the capital was moved to Dresden.

In 1759, the Austrians defeated the Prussians at the Battle of Meissen.

During World War II, a subcamp of Flossenbürg concentration camp was located in Meissen.

Meissen served as an important place of religious dialogue in 1988 when the agreement on mutual recognition between the German Evangelical Church (both East and West German) and the Church of England was signed in the town.

==Porcelain==

Meissen is famous for the manufacture of porcelain, based on extensive local deposits of china clay (kaolin) and potter&#x27;s clay (potter&#x27;s earth). Meissen porcelain was the first high-quality porcelain to be produced outside of the Orient.

The first European porcelain was manufactured in Meissen in 1710, when by decree of King Augustus II the Strong the Royal-Polish and Electoral-Saxon Porcelain Factory (&quot;Königlich-Polnische und Kurfürstlich-Sächsische Porzellan-Manufaktur&quot;) was opened in the Albrechtsburg. In 1861, it was moved to the &quot;Triebisch&quot; river valley of Meissen, where the porcelain factory can still be found today. Along with porcelain, other ceramics are also manufactured in the town. In the old town streets, there have been set up numerous porcelain stores, often selling antique Meissen porcelain and sometimes offering repair of broken porcelain. In Meissen and the surrounding area, several former painters from the manufacturer have set up porcelain painting workshops and galleries with their own pieces of porcelain art.

==Main sights==
The Albrechtsburg, the former residence of the House of Wettin, is regarded as being the first castle to be used as a royal residence in the German-speaking world. Built between 1472 and 1525, it is a fine example of late Gothic style. It was redecorated in the 19th century with a range of murals depicting Saxon history. Today the castle is a museum. Nearby is the 13th-century Gothic Meissen Cathedral (&quot;Meißner Dom&quot;), whose chapel is one of the most famous burial places of the Wettin family. The hill on which the castle and the cathedral are built offers a view over the roofs of the old town.

Meissen&#x27;s historical district is located mostly around the market at the foot of the castle hill. It contains many buildings of Renaissance architecture. Also imposing is the view from the 57-metre-high tower of the &quot;Frauenkirche&quot; (Church of Our Lady), situated in the old market-place. This church, not to be confused with the Dresden Frauenkirche, was first mentioned in a 1205 deed issued by Bishop Dietrich II and after a blaze about 1450 rebuilt in the Late Gothic style of a hall church. Its tower hosts the world&#x27;s first porcelain carillon, manufactured in 1929 on the occasion of the town&#x27;s 1000-years-jubilee. Another popular tourist sight is the world-famous Meissen porcelain factory.

From spring to autumn, several festivals take place in Meissen, such as the pottery market or the &quot;Weinfest&quot;, which celebrates the wine harvest. Meissen wine is produced at the vineyards in the river valley (&quot;Elbtal&quot;) around the town, part of the Saxonian wine region, one of the northernmost in Europe.

==Educational institutions==
Meissen is the home of the Saxon public elite college Sächsisches Landesgymnasium Sankt Afra zu Meißen.

Also the Saxon Civil Servants Academy and the Academy of the Evangelical Church of Saxony are located in the town.

==Sport==
Meissen Speedway Stadium is located on the eastern side of the town, on the Zaschendorfer Straße. The stadium was the venue for a round of the Speedway World Team Cup in 1965 and multiple qualifying rounds of the Speedway World Championship (the first in 1966).

<text>Luc Paul Maurice Besson (; born 18 March 1959) is a French filmmaker. He directed or produced the films &quot;Subway&quot; (1985), &quot;The Big Blue&quot; (1988), and &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; (1990). Associated with the &quot;Cinéma du look&quot; film movement, he has been nominated for a César Award for Best Director and Best Picture for his films &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc&quot; (1999). He won Best Director and Best French Director for his sci-fi action film &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (1997). He wrote and directed the sci-fi action film &quot;Lucy&quot; (2014) and the space opera film &quot;Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets&quot; (2017).

In 1980, near the beginning of his career, he founded his own production company, Les Films du Loup, later renamed Les Films du Dauphin. It was superseded in 2000 when he co-founded EuropaCorp with longtime collaborator . As writer, director, or producer, Besson has been involved in the creation of more than 50 films.

==Early life==
Besson was born in Paris, to parents who both worked as Club Med scuba-diving instructors. Influenced by this, he planned to become a marine biologist. He spent much of his youth traveling with his parents to tourist resorts in Italy, Yugoslavia, and Greece. The family returned to France when he was 10. His parents divorced, and both remarried; of this, he said:

&quot;Here there is two families, and I am the only bad souvenir of something that doesn&#x27;t work,&quot; he said in the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;. &quot;And if I disappear, then everything is perfect. The rage to exist comes from here. I have to do something! Otherwise I am going to die.&quot;

At age 17, Besson had a diving accident that left him unable to dive. In a 2000 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, he described how this influenced his choice of career:

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;I was 17 and I wondered what I was going to do. ... So I took a piece of paper and on the left I put everything I could do, or had skills for, and all the things I couldn&#x27;t do. The first line was shorter and I could see that I loved writing, I loved images, I was taking a lot of pictures. So I thought maybe movies would be good. But I thought that to really know I should go to a set. And a friend of mine knew a guy whose brother was a third assistant on a short film. It&#x27;s true. So, I said: &#x27;OK, let&#x27;s go on the set.&#x27; So I went on the set. The day after I went back to see my mum and told her that I was going to make films and stop school and &#x27;bye. And I did it! Very soon after I made a short film and it was very, very bad. I wanted to prove that I could do something, so I made a short film. That was in fact my main concern, to be able to show that I could do one.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

==Career==
Besson reportedly worked on the first drafts of &quot;Le Grand Bleu&quot; (&quot;The Big Blue&quot;) while still in his teens. Out of boredom, he started writing stories, including the background to what he later developed as &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (1997), one of his most popular movies, inspired by the French comic books he read as a teenager. He directed and co-wrote the screenplay of this science fiction thriller with American screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen.

At 18, Besson returned to his birthplace of Paris, where he took odd jobs in film to get a feel for the industry. He worked as an assistant to directors including Claude Faraldo and Patrick Grandperret. He directed three short films, a commissioned documentary, and several commercials. He then moved to the United States for three years, but returned to Paris, where he formed his own production company. He first named it &quot;Les Films du Loup&quot;, then changed it to &quot;Les Films du Dauphin&quot;.

In the early 1980s, Besson met Éric Serra and asked him to compose the score for his first short film, &quot;L&#x27;Avant dernier&quot;. He subsequently had Serra compose for other films. Since the late 20th century, Besson has written and produced numerous action movies, including the &quot;Taxi&quot; series (1998–2007), the &quot;Transporter&quot; series (2002–2008; another collaboration with Robert Mark Kamen), and the Jet Li films &quot;Kiss of the Dragon&quot; and &quot;Unleashed&quot;. His English-language films &quot;Taken&quot;, &quot;Taken 2&quot;, and &quot;Taken 3&quot;, all co-written with Kamen and starring Liam Neeson, have been major successes, with &quot;Taken 2&quot; becoming the largest-grossing export French film. Besson produced the promotional movie for the Paris 2012 Olympic bid.

Besson won the Lumières Award for Best Director and the César Award for Best Director, for his film &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (1997). He was nominated for Best Director and Best Picture César Awards for his films &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc&quot; (1999). French actor Jean Reno has appeared in several films by Besson, including (1983), &quot;Subway&quot; (1985), &quot;The Big Blue&quot; (1988), &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; (1990), and &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot; (1994).

In summer 2024, Besson directed &quot;,&quot; an adaptation of &quot;Dracula&quot; starring Caleb Landry Jones and features Christophe Waltz.

===Cinéma du look===
Critics such as Raphaël Bassan and Guy Austin cite Besson as a pivotal figure in the Cinéma du look movement—a specific, highly visual style produced from the 1980s into the early 1990s. &quot;Subway&quot; (1985), &quot;The Big Blue&quot; (1988) and &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; (1990) are all considered of this stylistic school. The term was coined by critic Raphaël Bassan in a 1989 essay in &quot;La Revue du Cinema n° 449&quot;. A partisan of the experimental cinema and friend of New Wave (&quot;nouvelle vague&quot;) directors, Bassan grouped Besson with Jean-Jacques Beineix and Leos Carax as three directors who shared the style of &quot;&quot;le look&quot;.&quot; These directors were later critically described as &quot;favouring style over substance, and spectacle over narrative&quot;.

Besson, and most of the filmmakers so categorised, were uncomfortable with the label. He contrasted their work with France&#x27;s New Wave. &quot;Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut were rebelling against existing cultural values and used cinema as a means of expression simply because it was the most avant-garde medium at the time,&quot; said Besson in a 1985 interview in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;Today, the revolution is occurring entirely within the industry and is led by people who want to change the look of movies by making them better, more convincing and pleasurable to watch.

&quot;Because it&#x27;s becoming increasingly difficult to break into this field, we have developed a psychological armor and are ready to do anything in order to work,&quot; he added. &quot;I think our ardor alone is going to shake the pillars of the moviemaking establishment.&quot;

Besson directed a biopic of Aung San Suu Kyi called &quot;The Lady&quot; (2011) (original title &quot;Dans la Lumiere&quot;). He also worked on &quot;Lockout&quot; (2012).

===Work===
Many of Besson&#x27;s films have achieved popular, if not always critical, success. Reviews were mixed for &quot;Le Grand Bleu (The Big Blue)&quot;. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the movie was &quot;too long and initially awkward but is clearly the work of a visionary.&quot;&quot;&quot;
&quot;When the film had its premiere on opening night at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival, it was mercilessly drubbed, but no matter; it was a smash,&quot; observed the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; in a 2007 profile of Besson. &quot;Embraced by young people who kept returning to see it again, the movie sold 10 million tickets and quickly became what the French call a &#x27;film générationnel,&#x27; a defining moment in the culture.&quot;

Besson created the hugely successful Arthur series, which comprises &quot;Arthur and the Minimoys&quot;, &quot;Arthur and the Forbidden City&quot;, &quot;Arthur and the Vengeance of Maltazard&quot; and &quot;Arthur and the War of the Two Worlds&quot;. He directed &quot;Arthur and the Invisibles&quot;, an adaptation of the first two books of the collection, starring Madonna and Robert DeNiro. A film with live action and animation, it was released in the UK and the US, as well as in France.

===Critical evaluation===
Besson has been described as &quot;the most Hollywood of French filmmakers&quot;. Scott Tobias wrote that his &quot;slick, commercial&quot; action movies were &quot;so interchangeable—drugs, sleaze, chuckling supervillainy, and Hong Kong-style effects—that each new project probably starts with white-out on the title page.&quot;

American film critic Armond White has praised Besson, whom he ranks as one of the best film producers, for refining and revolutionizing action film. He wrote that Besson dramatizes the struggle of his characters &quot;as a conscientious resistance to human degradation&quot;.

In 2012, film critic Eric Kohn wrote in &quot;Indiewire&quot;: &quot;Luc Besson’s filmography has been spotty for years, littered with equal amounts of sensationalistic pop art and flashy duds, a tendency that extends beyond his directing credits.&quot;

==Personal life==
Besson has been married four times; first, in 1986, to actress Anne Parillaud. They had a daughter, Juliette, born in 1987. Parillaud starred in Besson&#x27;s &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; (1990). They divorced in 1991.

Besson&#x27;s second wife was actress and director Maïwenn Le Besco, whom he started dating when he was 32 and she was 15 after having met 3 years earlier. They married in late 1992 when Le Besco, 16, was pregnant with their daughter Shanna, who was born on 3 January 1993. Le Besco later claimed that their relationship inspired Besson&#x27;s film &quot;Léon&quot; (1994), where the plot involved the emotional relationship between an adult man and a 12-year-old girl (played by then 12-year-old Natalie Portman). Their marriage ended in 1997, when Besson became involved with actress Milla Jovovich, then 19, during the production of &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (1997). &quot;We sensed the special chemistry between us immediately at the auditions and it just intensified during the filming of the movie,&quot; said Jovovich.

He married Jovovich on December 14, 1997, when he was and she was 21. They divorced in 1999.

On August 28, 2004, at age , Besson married film producer Virginie Silla, 32. They have three children, including the actress Thalia Besson.

Since 2025, he is in relationship with laywer Sarah Saldmann (fr), thirty-two years younger than him.

=== Rape accusation ===
In 2018, Dutch-Belgian actress Sand Van Roy, who appeared in &quot;Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets&quot;, accused Besson of rape. 

The director&#x27;s lawyer Thierry Marembert stated that Besson &quot;categorically denies these fantasist accusations&quot; and that the accuser was &quot;someone he knows, towards whom he has never behaved inappropriately&quot;.

In February 2019, French prosecutors dropped the case against him, citing lack of evidence. In December 2021, a judge dismissed the case against Besson following a second investigation. The public prosecutor&#x27;s office in Paris stated that &quot;the investigations clearly establish that the criminal facts of rape were not committed, that the absence of consent of the civil party is not established and the existence of a constraint, threat, violence, is not characterized&quot;. In April 2022, Van Roy submitted a complaint against the magistrate in charge of the case. In June 2023, Besson was definitively cleared of all charges, following a ruling by the Court of Cassation, the highest judicial court in France. This ruling prevents Van Roy from suing him on the same charges in France or elsewhere in Europe.

Several other women, including a former assistant, two students of Cité du Cinéma studio, and a former employee of Besson&#x27;s EuropaCorp, who all wished to remain anonymous, described &quot;inappropriate sexual behavior&quot; by the director. Having no physical evidence to support their stories, they did not press charges and avoided a defamation countersuit. Their stories were not used by the investigating judge.

==Film company==

In 2000, Besson superseded his production company by co-founding EuropaCorp with Pierre-Ange Le Pogam, with whom he had frequently worked since 1985. Le Pogam had then been Distribution Director with Gaumont. EuropaCorp has had strong growth based on several English-language films, with international distribution. It has production facilities in Paris, Normandy, and Hollywood, and is establishing distribution partnerships in Japan and China.

<doc id="40684" wikidata="Q228502" url="?curid=40684" title="Access control">
<text>In physical security and information security, access control (AC) is the selective restriction of access to a place or other resource, while access management describes the process. The act of &quot;accessing&quot; may mean consuming, entering, or using. Permission to access a resource is called &quot;authorization&quot;.

Access control on digital platforms is also termed admission control. The protection of external databases is essential to preserve digital security.

Access control is considered to be a significant aspect of privacy that should be further studied. Access control policy (also access policy) is part of an organization’s security policy. In order to verify the access control policy, organizations use an access control model. General security policies require designing or selecting appropriate security controls to satisfy an organization&#x27;s risk appetite - access policies similarly require the organization to design or select access controls.

==Physical security==


Geographical access control may be enforced by personnel (e.g. border guard, bouncer, ticket checker), or with a device such as a turnstile. There may be fences to avoid circumventing this access control. An alternative of access control in the strict sense (physically controlling access itself) is a system of checking authorized presence, see e.g. Ticket controller (transportation). A variant is exit control, e.g. of a shop (checkout) or a country.

The term access control refers to the practice of restricting entrance to a property, a building, or a room to authorized persons. Physical access control can be achieved by a human (a guard, bouncer, or receptionist), through mechanical means such as locks and keys, or through technological means such as access control systems like the mantrap. Within these environments, physical key management may also be employed as a means of further managing and monitoring access to mechanically keyed areas or access to certain small assets.

Physical access control is a matter of who, where, and when. An access control system determines who is allowed to enter or exit, where they are allowed to exit or enter, and when they are allowed to enter or exit. Historically, this was partially accomplished through keys and locks. When a door is locked, only someone with a key can enter through the door, depending on how the lock is configured. Mechanical locks and keys do not allow restriction of the key holder to specific times or dates. Mechanical locks and keys do not provide records of the key used on any specific door, and the keys can be easily copied or transferred to an unauthorized person. When a mechanical key is lost or the key holder is no longer authorized to use the protected area, the locks must be re-keyed.

=== Electronic access control ===

Electronic access control (EAC) uses computers to solve the limitations of mechanical locks and keys. It is particularly difficult to guarantee identification (a critical component of authentication) with mechanical locks and keys. A wide range of credentials can be used to replace mechanical keys, allowing for complete authentication, authorization, and accounting. The electronic access control system grants access based on the credential presented. When access is granted, the resource is unlocked for a predetermined time and the transaction is recorded. When access is refused, the resource remains locked and the attempted access is recorded. The system will also monitor the resource and alarm if the resource is forcefully unlocked or held open too long after being unlocked.

When a credential is presented to a reader, the reader sends the credential&#x27;s information, usually a number, to a control panel, a highly reliable processor. The control panel compares the credential&#x27;s number to an access control list, grants or denies the presented request, and sends a transaction log to a database. When access is denied based on the access control list, the door remains locked. If there is a match between the credential and the access control list, the control panel operates a relay that in turn unlocks the resource. The control panel also ignores an opening signal to prevent an alarm. Often the reader provides feedback, such as a flashing red LED for an access denied and a flashing green LED for an access granted.

The above description illustrates a single factor transaction. Credentials can be passed around, thus subverting the access control list. For example, Alice has access rights to the server room, but Bob does not. Alice either gives Bob her credential, or Bob takes it; he now has access to the server room. To prevent this, two-factor authentication can be used. In a two factor transaction, the presented credential and a second factor are needed for access to be granted; another factor can be a PIN, a second credential, operator intervention, or a biometric input.

There are three types (factors) of authenticating information:
* something the user knows, e.g. a password, pass-phrase or PIN
* something the user has, such as smart card or a key fob
* something the user is, such as the users fingerprint, verified by biometric measurement

Passwords are a common means of verifying a user&#x27;s identity before access is given to information systems. In addition, a fourth factor of authentication is now recognized: someone you know, whereby another person who knows you can provide a human element of authentication in situations where systems have been set up to allow for such scenarios. For example, a user may have their password, but have forgotten their smart card. In such a scenario, if the user is known to designated cohorts, the cohorts may provide their smart card and password, in combination with the extant factor of the user in question, and thus provide two factors for the user with the missing credential, giving three factors overall to allow access.

===Credential===
A credential is a physical/tangible object, a piece of knowledge, or a facet of a person&#x27;s physical being that enables an individual access to a given physical facility or computer-based information system. Typically, credentials can be something a person knows (such as a number or PIN), something they have (such as an access badge), something they are (such as a biometric feature), something they do (measurable behavioural patterns), or some combination of these items. This is known as multi-factor authentication. The typical credential is an access card or key-fob, and newer software can also turn users&#x27; smartphones into access devices.

There are many card technologies including magnetic stripe, bar code, Wiegand, 125 kHz proximity, 26-bit card-swipe, contact smart cards, and contactless smart cards. Also available are key-fobs, which are more compact than ID cards, and attach to a key ring. Biometric technologies include fingerprint, facial recognition, iris recognition, retinal scan, voice, and hand geometry. The built-in biometric technologies found on newer smartphones can also be used as credentials in conjunction with access software running on mobile devices. In addition to older more traditional card access technologies, newer technologies such as near-field communication (NFC), Bluetooth low energy or Ultra-wideband (UWB) can also communicate user credentials to readers for system or building access.

===Access control system components===

Components of an access control system include:
* An access control panel (also known as a controller)
* An access-controlled entry, such as a door, turnstile, parking gate, elevator, or other physical barrier
* A reader installed near the entry. (In cases where the exit is also controlled, a second reader is used on the opposite side of the entry.)
* Locking hardware, such as electric door strikes and electromagnetic locks
* A magnetic door switch for monitoring door position
* Request-to-exit (RTE) devices for allowing egress. When a RTE button is pushed, or the motion detector detects motion at the door, the door alarm is temporarily ignored while the door is opened. Exiting a door without having to electrically unlock the door is called mechanical free egress. This is an important safety feature. In cases where the lock must be electrically unlocked on exit, the request-to-exit device also unlocks the door.

===Access control topology===

Access control decisions are made by comparing the credentials to an access control list. This look-up can be done by a host or server, by an access control panel, or by a reader. The development of access control systems has observed a steady push of the look-up out from a central host to the edge of the system, or the reader. The predominant topology circa 2009 is hub and spoke with a control panel as the hub, and the readers as the spokes. The look-up and control functions are by the control panel. The spokes communicate through a serial connection; usually RS-485. Some manufactures are pushing the decision making to the edge by placing a controller at the door. The controllers are IP enabled, and connect to a host and database using standard networks

===Types of readers===
Access control readers may be classified by the functions they are able to perform:
* Basic (non-intelligent) readers: simply read card number or PIN, and forward it to a control panel. In case of biometric identification, such readers output the ID number of a user. Typically, Wiegand protocol is used for transmitting data to the control panel, but other options such as RS-232, RS-485 and Clock/Data are not uncommon. This is the most popular type of access control readers. Examples of such readers are RF Tiny by RFLOGICS, ProxPoint by HID, and P300 by Farpointe Data.
* Semi-intelligent readers: have all inputs and outputs necessary to control door hardware (lock, door contact, exit button), but do not make any access decisions. When a user presents a card or enters a PIN, the reader sends information to the main controller, and waits for its response. If the connection to the main controller is interrupted, such readers stop working, or function in a degraded mode. Usually semi-intelligent readers are connected to a control panel via an RS-485 bus. Examples of such readers are InfoProx Lite IPL200 by CEM Systems, and AP-510 by Apollo.
* Intelligent readers: have all inputs and outputs necessary to control door hardware; they also have memory and processing power necessary to make access decisions independently. Like semi-intelligent readers, they are connected to a control panel via an RS-485 bus. The control panel sends configuration updates, and retrieves events from the readers. Examples of such readers could be InfoProx IPO200 by CEM Systems, and AP-500 by Apollo. There is also a new generation of intelligent readers referred to as &quot;IP readers&quot;. Systems with IP readers usually do not have traditional control panels, and readers communicate directly to a PC that acts as a host.

Some readers may have additional features such as an LCD and function buttons for data collection purposes (i.e. clock-in/clock-out events for attendance reports), camera/speaker/microphone for intercom, and smart card read/write support.

1. Serial controllers. Controllers are connected to a host PC via a serial RS-485 communication line (or via 20mA current loop in some older systems). External RS-232/485 converters or internal RS-485 cards have to be installed, as standard PCs do not have RS-485 communication ports.

Advantages:
* RS-485 standard allows long cable runs, up to 4000 feet (1200 m)
* Relatively short response time. The maximum number of devices on an RS-485 line is limited to 32, which means that the host can frequently request status updates from each device, and display events almost in real time.
* High reliability and security as the communication line is not shared with any other systems.
Disadvantages: 
* RS-485 does not allow Star-type wiring unless splitters are used
* RS-485 is not well suited for transferring large amounts of data (i.e. configuration and users). The highest possible throughput is 115.2 kbit/sec, but in most system it is downgraded to 56.2 kbit/sec, or less, to increase reliability.
* RS-485 does not allow the host PC to communicate with several controllers connected to the same port simultaneously. Therefore, in large systems, transfers of configuration, and users to controllers may take a very long time, interfering with normal operations.
* Controllers cannot initiate communication in case of an alarm. The host PC acts as a master on the RS-485 communication line, and controllers have to wait until they are polled.
* Special serial switches are required, in order to build a redundant host PC setup.
* Separate RS-485 lines have to be installed, instead of using an already existing network infrastructure.
* Cable that meets RS-485 standards is significantly more expensive than regular Category 5 UTP network cable.
* Operation of the system is highly dependent on the host PC. In the case that the host PC fails, events from controllers are not retrieved, and functions that require interaction between controllers (i.e. anti-passback) stop working.

2. Serial main and sub-controllers. All door hardware is connected to sub-controllers (a.k.a. door controllers or door interfaces). Sub-controllers usually do not make access decisions, and instead forward all requests to the main controllers. Main controllers usually support from 16 to 32 sub-controllers.

Advantages:
* Work load on the host PC is significantly reduced, because it only needs to communicate with a few main controllers.
* The overall cost of the system is lower, as sub-controllers are usually simple and inexpensive devices.
* All other advantages listed in the first paragraph apply.
Disadvantages: 
* Operation of the system is highly dependent on main controllers. In case one of the main controllers fails, events from its sub-controllers are not retrieved, and functions that require interaction between sub-controllers (i.e. anti-passback) stop working.
* Some models of sub-controllers (usually lower cost) do not have the memory or processing power to make access decisions independently. If the main controller fails, sub-controllers change to degraded mode in which doors are either completely locked or unlocked, and no events are recorded. Such sub-controllers should be avoided, or used only in areas that do not require high security.
* Main controllers tend to be expensive, therefore such a topology is not very well suited for systems with multiple remote locations that have only a few doors.
* All other RS-485-related disadvantages listed in the first paragraph apply.

3. Serial main controllers &amp; intelligent readers. All door hardware is connected directly to intelligent or semi-intelligent readers. Readers usually do not make access decisions, and forward all requests to the main controller. Only if the connection to the main controller is unavailable, will the readers use their internal database to make access decisions and record events. Semi-intelligent reader that have no database and cannot function without the main controller should be used only in areas that do not require high security. Main controllers usually support from 16 to 64 readers. All advantages and disadvantages are the same as the ones listed in the second paragraph. 

4. Serial controllers with terminal servers. In spite of the rapid development and increasing use of computer networks, access control manufacturers remained conservative, and did not rush to introduce network-enabled products. When pressed for solutions with network connectivity, many chose the option requiring less efforts: addition of a terminal server, a device that converts serial data for transmission via LAN or WAN.

Advantages:
* Allows utilizing the existing network infrastructure for connecting separate segments of the system.
* Provides a convenient solution in cases when the installation of an RS-485 line would be difficult or impossible.
Disadvantages:
* Increases complexity of the system.
* Creates additional work for installers: usually terminal servers have to be configured independently, and not through the interface of the access control software.
* Serial communication link between the controller and the terminal server acts as a bottleneck: even though the data between the host PC and the terminal server travels at the 10/100/1000 Mbit/sec network speed, it must slow down to the serial speed of 112.5 kbit/sec or less. There are also additional delays introduced in the process of conversion between serial and network data.
All the RS-485-related advantages and disadvantages also apply.

5. Network-enabled main controllers. The topology is nearly the same as described in the second and third paragraphs. The same advantages and disadvantages apply, but the on-board network interface offers a couple of valuable improvements. Transmission of configuration and user data to the main controllers is faster, and may be done in parallel. This makes the system more responsive, and does not interrupt normal operations. No special hardware is required in order to achieve redundant host PC setup: in the case that the primary host PC fails, the secondary host PC may start polling network controllers. The disadvantages introduced by terminal servers (listed in the fourth paragraph) are also eliminated. 

6. IP controllers. Controllers are connected to a host PC via Ethernet LAN or WAN.

Advantages:
* An existing network infrastructure is fully utilized, and there is no need to install new communication lines.
* There are no limitations regarding the number of controllers (as the 32 per line in cases of RS-485).
* Special RS-485 installation, termination, grounding and troubleshooting knowledge is not required.
* Communication with the controllers may be done at the full network speed, which is important if transferring a lot of data (databases with thousands of users, possibly including biometric records).
* In case of an alarm, controllers may initiate connection to the host PC. This ability is important in large systems, because it serves to reduce network traffic caused by unnecessary polling.
* Simplifies installation of systems consisting of multiple sites that are separated by large distances. A basic Internet link is sufficient to establish connections to the remote locations.
* Wide selection of standard network equipment is available to provide connectivity in various situations (fiber, wireless, VPN, dual path, PoE)
Disadvantages: 
* The system becomes susceptible to network related problems, such as delays in case of heavy traffic and network equipment failures.
* Access controllers and workstations may become accessible to hackers if the network of the organization is not well protected. This threat may be eliminated by physically separating the access control network from the network of the organization. Most IP controllers utilize either Linux platform or proprietary operating systems, which makes them more difficult to hack. Industry standard data encryption is also used.
* Maximum distance from a hub or a switch to the controller (if using a copper cable) is 100 meters (330 ft).
* Operation of the system is dependent on the host PC. In case the host PC fails, events from controllers are not retrieved and functions that require interaction between controllers (i.e. anti-passback) stop working. Some controllers, however, have a peer-to-peer communication option in order to reduce dependency on the host PC.

7. IP readers. Readers are connected to a host PC via Ethernet LAN or WAN.

Advantages:
* Most IP readers are PoE capable. This feature makes it very easy to provide battery backed power to the entire system, including the locks and various types of detectors (if used).
* IP readers eliminate the need for controller enclosures.
* There is no wasted capacity when using IP readers (e.g. a 4-door controller would have 25% of unused capacity if it was controlling only 3 doors).
* IP reader systems scale easily: there is no need to install new main or sub-controllers.
* Failure of one IP reader does not affect any other readers in the system.

Disadvantages:
* In order to be used in high-security areas, IP readers require special input/output modules to eliminate the possibility of intrusion by accessing lock and/or exit button wiring. Not all IP reader manufacturers have such modules available.
* Being more sophisticated than basic readers, IP readers are also more expensive and sensitive, therefore they should not be installed outdoors in areas with harsh weather conditions, or high probability of vandalism, unless specifically designed for exterior installation. A few manufacturers make such models.
The advantages and disadvantages of IP controllers apply to the IP readers as well.

===Security risks===
The most common security risk of intrusion through an access control system is by simply following a legitimate user through a door, and this is referred to as tailgating. Often the legitimate user will hold the door for the intruder. This risk can be minimized through security awareness training of the user population or more active means such as turnstiles. In very high-security applications this risk is minimized by using a sally port, sometimes called a security vestibule or mantrap, where operator intervention is required presumably to assure valid identification.

The second most common risk is from levering a door open. This is relatively difficult on properly secured doors with strikes or high holding force magnetic locks. Fully implemented access control systems include forced door monitoring alarms. These vary in effectiveness, usually failing from high false positive alarms, poor database configuration, or lack of active intrusion monitoring. Most newer access control systems incorporate some type of door prop alarm to inform system administrators of a door left open longer than a specified length of time.

The third most common security risk is natural disasters. In order to mitigate risk from natural disasters, the structure of the building, down to the quality of the network and computer equipment vital. From an organizational perspective, the leadership will need to adopt and implement an All Hazards Plan, or Incident Response Plan. The highlights of any incident plan determined by the National Incident Management System must include Pre-incident planning, during incident actions, disaster recovery, and after-action review.

Similar to levering is crashing through cheap partition walls. In shared tenant spaces, the divisional wall is a vulnerability. A vulnerability along the same lines is the breaking of sidelights.

Spoofing locking hardware is fairly simple and more elegant than levering. A strong magnet can operate the solenoid controlling bolts in electric locking hardware. Motor locks, more prevalent in Europe than in the US, are also susceptible to this attack using a doughnut-shaped magnet. It is also possible to manipulate the power to the lock either by removing or adding current, although most Access Control systems incorporate battery back-up systems and the locks are almost always located on the secure side of the door. 

Access cards themselves have proven vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. Enterprising hackers have built portable readers that capture the card number from a user&#x27;s proximity card. The hacker simply walks by the user, reads the card, and then presents the number to a reader securing the door. This is possible because card numbers are sent in the clear, no encryption being used. To counter this, dual authentication methods, such as a card plus a PIN should always be used.

Many access control credentials unique serial numbers are programmed in sequential order during manufacturing. Known as a sequential attack, if an intruder has a credential once used in the system they can simply increment or decrement the serial number until they find a credential that is currently authorized in the system. Ordering credentials with random unique serial numbers is recommended to counter this threat.

Finally, most electric locking hardware still has mechanical keys as a fail-over. Mechanical key locks are vulnerable to bumping.

====The need-to-know principle====

The need to know principle can be enforced with user access controls and authorization procedures and its objective is to ensure that only authorized individuals gain access to information or systems necessary to undertake their duties.

== Computer security ==
In computer security, general access control includes authentication, authorization, and audit. A more narrow definition of access control would cover only access approval, whereby the system makes a decision to grant or reject an access request from an already authenticated subject, based on what the subject is authorized to access. Authentication and access control are often combined into a single operation, so that access is approved based on successful authentication, or based on an anonymous access token. Authentication methods and tokens include passwords, biometric analysis, physical keys, electronic keys and devices, hidden paths, social barriers, and monitoring by humans and automated systems.

In any access-control model, the entities that can perform actions on the system are called &quot;subjects&quot;, and the entities representing resources to which access may need to be controlled are called &quot;objects&quot; (see also Access Control Matrix). Subjects and objects should both be considered as software entities, rather than as human users: any human users can only have an effect on the system via the software entities that they control.

Although some systems equate subjects with &quot;user IDs&quot;, so that all processes started by a user by default have the same authority, this level of control is not fine-grained enough to satisfy the principle of least privilege, and arguably is responsible for the prevalence of malware in such systems (see computer insecurity).

In some models, for example the object-capability model, any software entity can potentially act as both subject and object.

, access-control models tend to fall into one of two classes: those based on capabilities and those based on access control lists (ACLs).
* In a capability-based model, holding an unforgeable reference or &quot;capability&quot; to an object provides access to the object (roughly analogous to how possession of one&#x27;s house key grants one access to one&#x27;s house); access is conveyed to another party by transmitting such a capability over a secure channel
* In an ACL-based model, a subject&#x27;s access to an object depends on whether its identity appears on a list associated with the object (roughly analogous to how a bouncer at a private party would check an ID to see if a name appears on the guest list); access is conveyed by editing the list. (Different ACL systems have a variety of different conventions regarding who or what is responsible for editing the list and how it is edited.)

Both capability-based and ACL-based models have mechanisms to allow access rights to be granted to all members of a &quot;group&quot; of subjects (often the group is itself modeled as a subject).

Access control systems provide the essential services of &quot;authorization&quot;, &quot;identification and authentication&quot; (&quot;I&amp;A&quot;), &quot;access approval&quot;, and &quot;accountability&quot; where:

* authorization specifies what a subject can do
* identification and authentication ensure that only legitimate subjects can log on to a system
* access approval grants access during operations, by association of users with the resources that they are allowed to access, based on the authorization policy
* accountability identifies what a subject (or all subjects associated with a user) did

=== Access control models ===
Access to accounts can be enforced through many types of controls.
# Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) An access control paradigm whereby access rights are granted to users through the use of policies which evaluate attributes (user attributes, resource attributes and environment conditions)
# Discretionary Access Control (DAC)In DAC, the data owner determines who can access specific resources. For example, a system administrator may create a hierarchy of files to be accessed based on certain permissions.
# Graph-based Access Control (GBAC)Compared to other approaches like RBAC or ABAC, the main difference is that in GBAC access rights are defined using an organizational query language instead of total enumeration.
# History-Based Access Control (HBAC)Access is granted or declined based on the real-time evaluation of a history of activities of the inquiring party, e.g. behavior, time between requests, content of requests. For example, the access to a certain service or data source can be granted or declined on the personal behavior, e.g. the request interval exceeds one query per second.
# History-of-Presence Based Access Control (HPBAC)Access control to resources is defined in terms of presence policies that need to be satisfied by presence records stored by the requestor. Policies are usually written in terms of frequency, spread and regularity. An example policy would be &quot;The requestor has made k separate visitations, all within last week, and no two consecutive visitations are apart by more than T hours.&quot;
# Identity-Based Access Control (IBAC)Using this network administrators can more effectively manage activity and access based on individual needs. 
# Lattice-Based Access Control (LBAC)A lattice is used to define the levels of security that an object may have and that a subject may have access to. The subject is only allowed to access an object if the security level of the subject is greater than or equal to that of the object.
# Mandatory Access Control (MAC)In MAC, users do not have much freedom to determine who has access to their files. For example, security clearance of users and classification of data (as confidential, secret or top secret) are used as security labels to define the level of trust.
# Organization-Based Access Control (OrBAC) OrBAC model allows the policy designer to define a security policy independently of the implementation
# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)RBAC allows access based on the job title. RBAC largely eliminates discretion when providing access to objects. For example, a human resources specialist should not have permissions to create network accounts; this should be a role reserved for network administrators.
# Rule-Based Access Control (RAC)RAC method, also referred to as Rule-Based Role-Based Access Control (RB-RBAC), is largely context based. Example of this would be allowing students to use labs only during a certain time of day; it is the combination of students&#x27; RBAC-based information system access control with the time-based lab access rules. 
# Responsibility Based Access Control Information is accessed based on the responsibilities assigned to an actor or a business role

==Telecommunications==
In telecommunications, the term &quot;access control&quot; is defined in U.S. Federal Standard 1037C with the following meanings: 
# A service feature or technique used to permit or deny use of the components of a communication system.
# A technique used to define or restrict the rights of individuals or application programs to obtain data from, or place data onto, a storage device.
# The definition or restriction of the rights of individuals or application programs to obtain data from, or place data into, a storage device.
# The process of limiting access to the resources of an AIS (Automated Information System) to authorized users, programs, processes, or other systems.
# That function performed by the resource controller that allocates system resources to satisfy user requests.

This definition depends on several other technical terms from Federal Standard 1037C.

===Attribute accessors===

Special public member methods – accessors (aka getters) and mutator methods (often called setters) are used to control changes to class variables in order to prevent unauthorized access and data corruption.

== Public policy ==
In public policy, access control to restrict access to systems (&quot;authorization&quot;) or to track or monitor behavior within systems (&quot;accountability&quot;) is an implementation feature of using trusted systems for security or social control.

<text>Access time is the time delay or latency between a request to an electronic system, and the access being initiated or the requested data returned.

In computer and software systems, it is the time interval between the point where an instruction control unit initiates a call to retrieve data or a request to store data, and the point at which delivery of the data is completed or the storage is started. Note that in distributed software systems, access time or latency should be measured through &#x27;99th percentile&quot;.&quot;&quot;&quot;

<doc id="40688" wikidata="Q192027" url="?curid=40688" title="Baud">
<text>In telecommunications and electronics, baud (; symbol: Bd) is a common unit of measurement of symbol rate, which is one of the components that determine the speed of communication over a data channel.

It is the unit for symbol rate or modulation rate in symbols per second or pulses per second. It is the number of distinct symbol changes (signalling events) made to the transmission medium per second in a digitally modulated signal or a bd rate line code.

Baud is related to &quot;gross bit rate&quot;, which can be expressed in bits per second (bit/s). If there are precisely two symbols in the system (typically 0 and 1), then baud and bits per second are equivalent.

== Naming ==
The baud unit is named after Émile Baudot, the inventor of the Baudot code for telegraphy, and is represented according to the rules for SI units. 
That is, the first letter of its symbol is uppercase (Bd), but when the unit is spelled out, it should be written in lowercase (baud) except when it begins a sentence or is capitalized for another reason, such as in title case.
It was defined by the CCITT (now the ITU) in November 1926. The earlier standard had been the number of words per minute, which was a less robust measure since word length can vary.

==Definitions==
The symbol duration time, also known as the unit interval, can be directly measured as the time between transitions by looking at an eye diagram of the signal on an oscilloscope. The symbol duration time &quot;T&quot;s can be calculated as:

:formula_1

where &quot;f&quot;s is the symbol rate.
There is also a chance of miscommunication which leads to ambiguity.

:Example: Communication at the baud rate &quot;1000 Bd&quot; means communication by means of sending &quot;1000 symbols per second&quot;. In the case of a modem, this corresponds to &quot;1000 tones per second&quot;; similarly, in the case of a line code, this corresponds to &quot;1000 pulses per second&quot;. The symbol duration time is &quot; second&quot; (that is, &quot;1 millisecond&quot;).

The baud is scaled using standard metric prefixes, so that for example
*1 kBd (kilobaud) = 1000 Bd
*1 MBd (megabaud) = 1000 kBd
*1 GBd (gigabaud) = 1000 MBd

==Relationship to gross bit rate==
The symbol rate is related to gross bit rate expressed in bit/s.
The term baud has sometimes incorrectly been used to mean bit rate, since these rates are the same in old modems as well as in the simplest digital communication links using only one bit per symbol, such that binary digit &quot;0&quot; is represented by one symbol, and binary digit &quot;1&quot; by another symbol. In more advanced modems and data transmission techniques, a symbol may have more than two states, so it may represent more than one bit. A bit (binary digit) always represents one of two states.

If bits are conveyed per symbol, and the gross bit rate is , inclusive of channel coding overhead, the symbol rate can be calculated as

:formula_2

By taking information per pulse &quot;N&quot; in bit/pulse to be the base-2-logarithm of the number of distinct messages &quot;M&quot; that could be sent, Hartley constructed a measure of the gross bit rate &quot;R&quot; as

:formula_3 where formula_4

Here, the formula_5 denotes the ceiling function of formula_6, where formula_6 is taken to be any real number greater than zero, then the ceiling function rounds up to the nearest natural number (e.g. formula_8).

In that case, different symbols are used. In a modem, these may be time-limited sinewave tones with unique combinations of amplitude, phase and/or frequency. For example, in a 64QAM modem, , and so the bit rate is times the baud rate. In a line code, these may be &quot;M&quot; different voltage levels.

The ratio is not necessarily an integer; in 4B3T coding, the bit rate is of the baud rate. (A typical basic rate interface with a 160 kbit/s raw data rate operates at 120 kBd.) 

Codes with many symbols, and thus a bit rate higher than the symbol rate, are most useful on channels such as telephone lines with a limited bandwidth but a high signal-to-noise ratio within that bandwidth. In other applications, the bit rate is less than the symbol rate. Eight-to-fourteen modulation as used on audio CDs has bit rate of the baud rate.

<doc id="40690" wikidata="Q1361224" url="?curid=40690" title="Acoustic coupler">
<text>In telecommunications, an acoustic coupler is an interface device for coupling electrical signals by acoustical means—usually into and out of a telephone.

The link is achieved through converting electric signals from the phone line to sound and reconverting sound to electric signals needed for the end terminal, such as a teletypewriter, and back, rather than through direct electrical connection.

==History and applications==

Prior to its breakup in 1984, Bell System&#x27;s legal monopoly over telephony in the United States allowed the company to impose strict rules on how consumers could access their network. Customers were prohibited from connecting equipment not made or sold by Bell to the network. The same set-up was operative in nearly all countries, where the telephone companies were nationally owned. In many households, telephones were hard-wired to wall terminals before connectors like RJ11 and BS 6312 became standardized.

The situation was similar in other countries. In Australia, until 1975 the PMG, a Government monopoly, owned all telephone wiring and equipment in user premises and prohibited attachment of third party devices, and while most handsets were connected by 600 series connectors, these were rare in Australia so imported equipment could not be directly connected in any case, despite the general electrical compatibility.

It was not until a landmark U.S. court ruling regarding the Hush-A-Phone in 1956 that the use of a phone attachment (by a third party vendor) was allowed for the first time; though AT&amp;T&#x27;s right to regulate any device connected to the telephone system was upheld by the courts, they were instructed to cease interference towards Hush-A-Phone users. A second court decision in 1968 regarding the Carterfone further allowed &quot;any device not harmful to the system&quot; to be connected directly to the AT&amp;T network. This decision enabled the proliferation of later innovations like answering machines, fax machines, and modems.

When inventors began developing devices to send non-voice signals over a telephone line, the need for a workaround for the Bell restrictions was apparent. As early as 1937, telefax machines used by newspapers were using some kind of couplers, possibly acoustic but more likely magnetic for single-directional communication. Multiplexed bidirectional telephone coupling was not needed by these early fax machines.

Robert Weitbrecht created a workaround for the Bell restrictions in 1963. He developed a coupling device that converted sound from the ear piece of the telephone handset to electrical signals, and converted the electrical pulses coming from the teletypewriter to sound that goes into the mouth piece of the telephone handset. His acoustic coupler is known as the Weitbrecht Modem.

The Weitbrecht Modem inspired other engineers to develop other modems to work with 8-bit ASCII terminals at a faster rate. Such modems or couplers were developed around 1966 by John van Geen at the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International), that mimicked handset operations. An early commercial model was built by Livermore Data Systems in 1968. One would dial the computer system (which would have telephone company datasets) on one&#x27;s phone, and when the connection was established, place the handset into the acoustic modem. 
Since the handsets were all supplied by the telephone company, most had the same shape, simplifying the physical interface. A microphone and a speaker inside the modem box would pick up and transmit the signaling tones, and circuitry would convert those audio frequency-shift keying encoded binary signals for an RS232 output socket. With luck one could get 300 baud (~bits/second) transmission rates, but 150 baud was more typical. 
That speed was sufficient for typewriter-based terminals, as the IBM 2741, running at 134.5 baud, or a teleprinter, running at 110 baud.

The practical upper limit for acoustic-coupled modems was 1200 baud, first made available in 1973 by Vadic and 1977 by AT&amp;T. 1200 baud endpoints became widespread in 1985 with the advent of the Hayes Smartmodem 1200A, though it used an RJ11 jack and was not an acoustic coupler. Such devices facilitated the creation of dial-up bulletin board systems, a forerunner of modern internet chat rooms, message boards, and e-mail.

==Design==
Usually, a telephone handset was placed into a cradle that had been engineered to fit closely (by the use of rubber seals) around its microphone and earpiece. A modem would modulate a loudspeaker in the cup attached to the handset&#x27;s microphone, and sound from the speaker in the telephone handset&#x27;s earpiece would be picked up by a microphone in the cup attached to that. In this way signals could be passed in both directions. Despite the use of seals, acoustic couplers were sensitive to external noise and depended on the then-widespread standardization of the size and shape of handsets.

Once direct electrical connections to telephone networks were made legal, they rapidly became the preferred method of attaching modems, and the use of acoustic couplers dwindled. Acoustic couplers were still used until at least the late 1990s by people travelling in areas of the world where electrical connection to the telephone network was illegal or impractical. Many models of Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD) still have a built-in acoustic coupler, which allow more universal use with pay phones and for emergency calls by deaf people.

==Popular culture==

An acoustic coupler (a Novation CAT 300 baud model) is prominently shown early in the 1983 film &quot;WarGames&quot;, when character David Lightman (portrayed by actor Matthew Broderick) places a telephone handset into the cradle of a prop acoustic modem to accentuate the act of using telephone lines for interconnection to the developing computer networks of the period—in this case, a military command computer. The earliest major motion picture depicting an acoustic coupler was probably the 1968 Steve McQueen film &quot;Bullitt&quot;.

<doc id="40692" wikidata="Q1806565" url="?curid=40692" title="Active laser medium">
<text>The active laser medium (also called a gain medium or lasing medium) is the source of optical gain within a laser. The gain results from the stimulated emission of photons through electronic or molecular transitions to a lower energy state from a higher energy state previously populated by a pump source.

Examples of active laser media include:
* Certain crystals, typically doped with rare-earth ions (e.g. neodymium, ytterbium, or erbium) or transition metal ions (titanium or chromium); most often yttrium aluminium garnet (Y3Al5O12), yttrium orthovanadate (YVO4), or sapphire (Al2O3); and not often caesium cadmium bromide (CsCdBr3) (solid-state lasers)
* Glasses, e.g. silicate or phosphate glasses, doped with laser-active ions;
* Gases, e.g. mixtures of helium and neon (HeNe), nitrogen, argon, krypton, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, or metal vapors; (gas lasers)
* Semiconductors, e.g. gallium arsenide (GaAs), indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs), or gallium nitride (GaN).
* Liquids, in the form of dye solutions as used in dye lasers.

In order to fire a laser, the active gain medium must be changed into a state in which population inversion occurs. The preparation of this state requires an external energy source and is known as laser pumping. Pumping may be achieved with electrical currents (e.g. semiconductors, or gases via high-voltage discharges) or with light, generated by discharge lamps or by other lasers (semiconductor lasers). More exotic gain media can be pumped by chemical reactions, nuclear fission, or with high-energy electron beams.

==Example of a model of gain medium==
The simplest model of optical gain in real systems includes just two, energetically well separated, groups of sub-levels. Within each sub-level group, fast transitions ensure that thermal equilibrium is reached quickly. Stimulated emissions between upper and lower groups, essential for gain, require the upper levels to be more populated than the corresponding lower ones. This situation is called population-inversion. It is more readily achieved if unstimulated transition rates between the two groups are slow, i.e. the upper levels are metastable. Population inversions are more easily produced when only the lowest sublevels are occupied, requiring either low temperatures or well energetically split groups. 

In the case of amplification of optical signals, the lasing frequency is called &quot;signal frequency.&quot; If the externally provided energy required for the signal&#x27;s amplification is optical, it would necessarily be at the same or higher &quot;pump&quot; frequency. 

===Cross-sections===
The simple medium can be characterized with effective cross-sections of absorption and emission at frequencies formula_1 and formula_2.
* Have formula_3 be concentration of active centers in the solid-state lasers.
* Have formula_4 be concentration of active centers in the ground state.
* Have formula_5 be concentration of excited centers.
* Have formula_6.

The relative concentrations can be defined as formula_7 and formula_8.

The rate of transitions of an active center from the ground state to the excited state can be expressed like this: formula_9.

While the rate of transitions back to the ground state can be expressed like: formula_10,
where formula_11 and formula_12 are effective cross-sections of absorption at the frequencies of the signal and the pump, formula_13 and formula_14 are the same for stimulated emission, and
formula_15 is rate of the spontaneous decay of the upper level.

Then, the kinetic equation for relative populations can be written as follows:

formula_16

The dynamic saturation intensities can be defined:

formula_17,
formula_18.

The absorption at strong signal:
formula_19.

The gain at strong pump:
formula_20,
where formula_21
is determinant of cross-section.

Gain never exceeds value formula_22, and absorption never exceeds value formula_23.

At given intensities formula_24, formula_25 of pump and signal, the gain and absorption
can be expressed as follows:

formula_26,
formula_27,

where 
formula_28, 
formula_29, 
formula_30, 
formula_31 .

===Identities===
The following identities take place:
formula_32, formula_33

The state of gain medium can be characterized with a single parameter, such as population of the upper level, gain or absorption.

===Efficiency of the gain medium===
The efficiency of a gain medium can be defined as
formula_34.

Within the same model, the efficiency can be expressed as follows:
formula_35.

For efficient operation, both intensities—pump and signal—should exceed their saturation intensities:
formula_36, and formula_37.

The estimates above are valid for a medium uniformly filled with pump and signal light. Spatial hole burning may slightly reduce the efficiency because some regions are pumped well, but the pump is not efficiently withdrawn by the signal in the nodes of the interference of counter-propagating waves.

<text>Adaptive predictive coding (APC) is a narrowband analog-to-digital conversion that uses a one-level or multilevel sampling system in which the value of the signal at each sampling instant is predicted according to a linear function of the past values of the quantized signals.

APC is related to linear predictive coding (LPC) in that both use adaptive predictors. However, APC uses fewer prediction coefficients, thus requiring a higher sampling rate than LPC.

<doc id="40695" wikidata="Q4681062" url="?curid=40695" title="Adder–subtractor">
<text>In digital circuits, an adder–subtractor is a circuit that is capable of adding or subtracting numbers (in particular, binary). Below is a circuit that adds &quot;or&quot; subtracts depending on a control signal. It is also possible to construct a circuit that performs both addition and subtraction at the same time.

==Construction==

Having an &quot;n&quot;-bit adder for &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, then . Then, assume the numbers are in two&#x27;s complement. Then to perform , two&#x27;s complement theory says to invert each bit of &quot;A&quot; with a NOT gate then add one. This yields , which is easy to do with a slightly modified adder.

By preceding each &quot;A&quot; input bit on the adder with a 2-to-1 multiplexer where:
* Input 0 (&quot;I&quot;0) is &quot;A&quot;
* Input 1 (&quot;I&quot;1) is 
that has control input &quot;D&quot; that is also connected to the initial carry, then the modified adder performs
* addition when , or
* subtraction when .
This works because when the &quot;A&quot; input to the adder is really and the carry in is 1. Adding &quot;B&quot; to and 1 yields the desired subtraction of .

A way you can mark number &quot;A&quot; as positive or negative without using a multiplexer on each bit is to use an XOR gate to precede each bit instead. 
* The first input to the XOR gate is the actual input bit
* The second input for each XOR gate is the control input &quot;D&quot;
This produces the same truth table for the bit arriving at the adder as the multiplexer solution does since the XOR gate output will be what the input bit is when and the inverted input bit when .

==Role in the arithmetic logic unit==
Adders are a part of the core of an arithmetic logic unit (ALU). The control unit decides which operations an ALU should perform (based on the op code being executed) and sets the ALU operation. The &quot;D&quot; input to the adder–subtractor above would be one such control line from the control unit.

The adder–subtractor above could easily be extended to include more functions. For example, a 2-to-1 multiplexer could be introduced on each &quot;Bi&quot; that would switch between zero and &quot;Bi&quot;; this could be used (in conjunction with ) to yield the two&#x27;s complement of &quot;A&quot; since .

A further step would be to change the 2-to-1 multiplex on &quot;A&quot; to a 4-to-1 with the third input being zero, then replicating this on &quot;Bi&quot; thus yielding the following output functions:
* 0 (with both the &quot;Ai&quot; and &quot;Bi&quot; inputs set to zero and )
* 1 (with both the &quot;Ai&quot; and &quot;Bi&quot; inputs set to zero and )
* &quot;A&quot; (with the &quot;Bi&quot; input set to zero)
* &quot;B&quot; (with the &quot;Ai&quot; input set to zero)
* (with the &quot;Bi&quot; input set to zero and )
* (with the &quot;Ai&quot; input set to zero and )
* 
* (with &quot;Ai&quot; set to invert; &quot;Bi&quot; set to zero; and )
* −&quot;A&quot; (with &quot;Ai&quot; set to invert; &quot;Bi&quot; set to zero; and )
* (with &quot;Bi&quot; set to invert; &quot;Ai&quot; set to zero; and )
* −&quot;B&quot; (with &quot;Bi&quot; set to invert; &quot;Ai&quot; set to zero; and )

By adding more logic in front of the adder, a single adder can be converted into much more than just an adder—an ALU.

<doc id="40699" wikidata="Q4683140" url="?curid=40699" title="Adjacent-channel interference">
<text>Adjacent-channel interference (ACI) is interference caused by extraneous power from a signal in an adjacent channel. ACI may be caused by inadequate filtering (such as incomplete filtering of unwanted modulation products in FM systems), improper tuning or poor frequency control (in the reference channel, the interfering channel or both).

ACI is distinguished from crosstalk.

==Origin==
The adjacent-channel interference which receiver A experiences from a transmitter B is the sum of the power that B emits into A&#x27;s channel—known as the &quot;unwanted emission&quot;, and represented by the ACLR (Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio)—and the power that A picks up from B&#x27;s channel, which is represented by the ACS (Adjacent Channel Selectivity). B emitting power into A&#x27;s channel is called adjacent-channel leakage (unwanted emissions). It occurs for two reasons. First, because RF filters require a roll-off, and do not eliminate a signal completely. Second, due to intermodulation in B&#x27;s amplifiers, which cause the transmitted spectrum to spread beyond what was intended. Therefore, B emits some power in the adjacent channel which is picked up by A. A receives some emissions from B&#x27;s channel due to the roll off of A&#x27;s selectivity filters. Selectivity filters are designed to &quot;select&quot; a channel. Similarly, B&#x27;s signal suffers intermodulation distortion passing through A&#x27;s RF input amplifiers, leaking more power into adjacent frequencies.

==Avoidance procedure==
Broadcast regulators frequently manage the broadcast spectrum in order to minimize adjacent-channel interference. For example, in North America, FM radio stations in a single region cannot be licensed on adjacent frequencies — that is, if a station is licensed on 99.5 MHz in a city, the first-adjacent frequencies of 99.3 MHz and 99.7 MHz cannot be used anywhere within a certain distance of that station&#x27;s transmitter, and the second-adjacent frequencies of 99.1 MHz and 99.9 MHz are restricted to specialized usages such as low-power stations. Similar restrictions formerly applied to third-adjacent frequencies as well (i.e. 98.9 MHz and 100.1 MHz in the example above), but these are no longer observed.

<text>In telecommunications, Advanced Data Communication Control Procedures (or Protocol) (ADCCP) is a bit-oriented data link layer protocol developed by the American National Standards Institute. It is functionally equivalent to the ISO High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) protocol.

Although the ISO and ANSI standards writers coordinated their work, so the differences between the standards are mainly editorial, there is one meaningful difference: ADCCP&#x27;s definition of the basic subset required to implement balanced asynchronous mode includes the RSET frame, while HDLC makes it optional.

One major difference between the two is the unnumbered (U) format. When extended (7-bit) sequence numbers are used, I and S frames have two-byte control fields. Like early versions of HDLC, ADCCP specifies a 2-byte control field format with the P/F flag duplicated. Later HDLC specifications, in particular ISO/IEC 13239, changed that to specify that U frames have 1-byte control fields in all cases.

<text>In telecommunications an aerial insert is a segment of cabling that rises from ground to a point above ground, followed by an overhead run, e.g. on poles, followed by a drop back into the ground. An aerial insert is used in places where it is not possible or practical to place a cable underground. Aerial inserts might be encountered in crossing deep ditches, canals, rivers, or subway lines.

Aerial inserts can be found for the same reason also in underground power transmission lines. However for this purpose, the aerial insert is in most cases realized as classical overhead line. It is also possible that a powerline consists of multiple underground and overhead sections of different length.

<text>Airborne radio relay is a technique employing aircraft fitted with radio relay stations for the purpose of increasing the range, flexibility, or physical security of communications systems. The aircraft may be manned or unmanned aerial vehicles.

==Use in Vietnam==

One of the first uses of airborne radio relay was by the United States Army&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Division in the Battle of Ia Drang during the Vietnam War, which employed the technique to improve communications with commanders at headquarters. The action of war had shifted to the borders of Laos and Cambodia, where the hilly terrain made the monetary and human cost of seizing and holding high ground, and airlifting and installing radio relay equipment prohibitive. In 1968, the Department of the Army provided four specially-equipped relay aircraft to the Division, which proved invaluable throughout the country, in particular, during the 1st Cavalry Division&#x27;s relief of Khe Sanh in 1968.

The use of airborne radio relay was a great success, although two problems arose during the Vietnam War. The first was the limitations of the aircraft used as relays. The 1st Cavalry Division had originally used C-7 Caribous as the relay aircraft, but when these planes were turned over to the Air Force, the equipment was installed in single-engine Otter aircraft, which were too underpowered to carry the heavy equipment required for relay. Eventually, the 1st Signal Brigade was provided with six specially-equipped U-21 aircraft for use in relay operations. The second problem was that of radio frequency interference: the limited frequency spectrum in use for combat radios meant that relay aircraft often interfered with the communication of ground units when their frequencies were overridden by the airborne units. The Army eventually assigned certain frequencies for airborne relay only, although this further limited the frequencies available to ground units.

<text>In telecommunications, the term alarm sensor has the following meanings:

# In communications systems, a device that can sense an abnormal condition within the system and provide a signal indicating the presence or nature of the abnormality to either a local or remote alarm indicator, and (b) may detect events ranging from a simple contact opening or closure to a time-phased automatic shutdown and restart cycle.
# In a physical security system, an approved device used to indicate a change in the physical environment of a facility or a part thereof.
# In electronic security systems, a physical device or change/presence of any electronic signal/logic which causes trigger to electronic circuit to perform application specific operation. In electronic alarm systems the use of this trigger event done by such devices is to turn on the alarm or siren producing sound and/or perform a security calling through telephone lines.

&quot;Note:&quot; Alarm sensors may also be redundant or chained, such as when one alarm sensor is used to protect the housing, cabling, or power protected by another alarm sensor.

<text>An A-law algorithm is a standard companding algorithm, used in European 8-bit PCM digital communications systems to optimize, i.e. modify, the dynamic range of an analog signal for digitizing. It is one of the two companding algorithms in the G.711 standard from ITU-T, the other being the similar μ-law, used in North America and Japan.

For a given input formula_1, the equation for A-law encoding is as follows:
formula_2

where formula_3 is the compression parameter. In Europe, formula_4.

A-law expansion is given by the inverse function:
formula_5

The reason for this encoding is that the wide dynamic range of speech does not lend itself well to efficient linear digital encoding. A-law encoding effectively reduces the dynamic range of the signal, thereby increasing the coding efficiency and resulting in a signal-to-distortion ratio that is superior to that obtained by linear encoding for a given number of bits.

== Comparison to μ-law ==
The μ-law algorithm provides a slightly larger dynamic range than the A-law at the cost of worse proportional distortion for small signals. By convention, A-law is used for an international connection if at least one country uses it.

<text>The Allan variance (AVAR), also known as two-sample variance, is a measure of frequency stability in clocks, oscillators and amplifiers. It is named after David W. Allan and expressed mathematically as formula_1.
The Allan deviation (ADEV), also known as sigma-tau, is the square root of the Allan variance, formula_2.

The &quot;M-sample variance&quot; is a measure of frequency stability using &quot;M&quot; samples, time &quot;T&quot; between measurements and observation time formula_3. &quot;M&quot;-sample variance is expressed as

:formula_4

The Allan variance is intended to estimate stability due to noise processes and not that of systematic errors or imperfections such as frequency drift or temperature effects. The Allan variance and Allan deviation describe frequency stability. See also the section Interpretation of value below.

There are also different adaptations or alterations of Allan variance, notably the modified Allan variance MAVAR or MVAR, the total variance, and the Hadamard variance. There also exist time-stability variants such as time deviation (TDEV) or time variance (TVAR). Allan variance and its variants have proven useful outside the scope of timekeeping and are a set of improved statistical tools to use whenever the noise processes are not unconditionally stable, thus a derivative exists.

The general &quot;M&quot;-sample variance remains important, since it allows dead time in measurements, and bias functions allow conversion into Allan variance values. Nevertheless, for most applications the special case of 2-sample, or &quot;Allan variance&quot; with formula_5 is of greatest interest.

==Background==
When investigating the stability of crystal oscillators and atomic clocks, it was found that they did not have a phase noise consisting only of white noise, but also of flicker frequency noise. These noise forms become a challenge for traditional statistical tools such as standard deviation, as the estimator will not converge. The noise is thus said to be divergent. Early efforts in analysing the stability included both theoretical analysis and practical measurements.

An important side consequence of having these types of noise was that, since the various methods of measurements did not agree with each other, the key aspect of repeatability of a measurement could not be achieved. This limits the possibility to compare sources and make meaningful specifications to require from suppliers. Essentially all forms of scientific and commercial uses were then limited to dedicated measurements, which hopefully would capture the need for that application.

To address these problems, David Allan introduced the &quot;M&quot;-sample variance and (indirectly) the two-sample variance. While the two-sample variance did not completely allow all types of noise to be distinguished, it provided a means to meaningfully separate many noise-forms for time-series of phase or frequency measurements between two or more oscillators. Allan provided a method to convert between any &quot;M&quot;-sample variance to any &quot;N&quot;-sample variance via the common 2-sample variance, thus making all &quot;M&quot;-sample variances comparable. The conversion mechanism also proved that &quot;M&quot;-sample variance does not converge for large &quot;M&quot;, thus making them less useful. IEEE later identified the 2-sample variance as the preferred measure.

An early concern was related to time- and frequency-measurement instruments that had a dead time between measurements. Such a series of measurements did not form a continuous observation of the signal and thus introduced a systematic bias into the measurement. Great care was spent in estimating these biases. The introduction of zero-dead-time counters removed the need, but the bias-analysis tools have proved useful.

Another early aspect of concern was related to how the bandwidth of the measurement instrument would influence the measurement, such that it needed to be noted. It was later found that by algorithmically changing the observation formula_3, only low formula_3 values would be affected, while higher values would be unaffected. The change of formula_3 is done by letting it be an integer multiple formula_9 of the measurement timebase formula_10:

:formula_11

The physics of crystal oscillators were analyzed by D. B. Leeson, and the result is now referred to as Leeson&#x27;s equation. The feedback in the oscillator will make the white noise and flicker noise of the feedback amplifier and crystal become the power-law noises of formula_12 white frequency noise and formula_13 flicker frequency noise respectively. These noise forms have the effect that the standard variance estimator does not converge when processing time-error samples. The mechanics of the feedback oscillators was unknown when the work on oscillator stability started, but was presented by Leeson at the same time as the set of statistical tools was made available by David W. Allan. For a more thorough presentation on the Leeson effect, see modern phase-noise literature.

==Interpretation of value==
Allan variance is defined as one half of the time average of the squares of the differences between successive readings of the frequency deviation sampled over the sampling period. The Allan variance depends on the time period used between samples, therefore, it is a function of the sample period, commonly denoted as &quot;τ&quot;, likewise the distribution being measured, and is displayed as a graph rather than a single number. A low Allan variance is a characteristic of a clock with good stability over the measured period.

Allan deviation is widely used for plots (conventionally in log–log format) and presentation of numbers. It is preferred, as it gives the relative amplitude stability, allowing ease of comparison with other sources of errors.

An Allan deviation of 1.3 at observation time 1 s (i.e. &quot;τ&quot; = 1 s) should be interpreted as there being an instability in frequency between two observations 1 second apart with a relative root mean square (RMS) value of 1.3. For a 10 MHz clock, this would be equivalent to 13 mHz RMS movement. If the phase stability of an oscillator is needed, then the time deviation variants should be consulted and used.

One may convert the Allan variance and other time-domain variances into frequency-domain measures of time (phase) and frequency stability.

==Formulations==

===&quot;M&quot;-sample variance===
Given a time-series formula_14, for any positive real numbers formula_15, define the real number sequenceformula_16Then the formula_17-sample variance is defined (here in a modernized notation form) as the Bessel-corrected variance of the sequence formula_18:formula_19The interpretation of the symbols is as follows:

* formula_20 is the reading on a reference clock (in arbitrary units).
* formula_14 is the reading of a clock we are testing (in arbitrary units), as a function of the reference clock&#x27;s reading. It can also be interpreted as the average fractional frequency time series.
* formula_22 is the &quot;n&quot;th fractional frequency average over the observation time formula_3.
* formula_17 is the number of clock reading intervals used in computing the formula_17-sample variance,
* formula_26 is the time between each frequency sample,
* formula_3 is the time length of each frequency estimate, or the observation period.

Dead-time can be accounted for by letting the time formula_26 be different from that of formula_3.

===Allan variance===
The Allan variance is defined as

:formula_30

where formula_31 denotes the expectation operator.

The condition formula_32 means the samples are taken with no dead-time between them.

===Allan deviation===
Just as with standard deviation and variance, the Allan deviation is defined as the square root of the Allan variance:

:formula_33

==Supporting definitions==

===Oscillator model===

The oscillator being analysed is assumed to follow the basic model of

: formula_34

The oscillator is assumed to have a nominal frequency of formula_35, given in cycles per second (SI unit: hertz). The nominal angular frequency formula_36 (in radians per second) is given by

: formula_37

The total phase can be separated into a perfectly cyclic component formula_38, along with a fluctuating component formula_39:

: formula_40

===Time error===
The time-error function &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the difference between expected nominal time and actual normal time:

: formula_41

For measured values a time-error series TE(&quot;t&quot;) is defined from the reference time function &quot;T&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) as

: formula_42

===Frequency function===
The frequency function formula_43 is the frequency over time, defined as

: formula_44

===Fractional frequency===
The fractional frequency &quot;y&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the normalized difference between the frequency formula_43 and the nominal frequency formula_35:

:formula_47

===Average fractional frequency===
The average fractional frequency is defined as

:formula_48

where the average is taken over observation time &quot;τ&quot;, the &quot;y&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the fractional-frequency error at time &quot;t&quot;, and &quot;τ&quot; is the observation time.

Since &quot;y&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the derivative of &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), we can without loss of generality rewrite it as

:formula_49

==Estimators==
This definition is based on the statistical expected value, integrating over infinite time. The real-world situation does not allow for such time-series, in which case a statistical estimator needs to be used in its place. A number of different estimators will be presented and discussed.

===Conventions===
===Fixed &quot;τ&quot; estimators===
A first simple estimator would be to directly translate the definition into

:formula_50

or for the time series:

:formula_51

These formulas, however, only provide the calculation for the &quot;τ&quot; = &quot;τ&quot;0 case. To calculate for a different value of &quot;τ&quot;, a new time-series needs to be provided.

===Non-overlapped variable τ estimators===
Taking the time-series and skipping past &quot;n&quot; − 1 samples, a new (shorter) time-series would occur with &quot;τ&quot;0 as the time between the adjacent samples, for which the Allan variance could be calculated with the simple estimators. These could be modified to introduce the new variable &quot;n&quot; such that no new time-series would have to be generated, but rather the original time series could be reused for various values of &quot;n&quot;. The estimators become

:formula_52

with formula_53,

and for the time series:

:formula_54

with formula_55.

These estimators have a significant drawback in that they will drop a significant amount of sample data, as only 1/&quot;n&quot; of the available samples is being used.

===Overlapped variable &quot;τ&quot; estimators===
A technique presented by J. J. Snyder provided an improved tool, as measurements were overlapped in &quot;n&quot; overlapped series out of the original series. The overlapping Allan variance estimator was introduced by Howe, Allan and Barnes. This can be shown to be equivalent to averaging the time or normalized frequency samples in blocks of &quot;n&quot; samples prior to processing. The resulting predictor becomes

:formula_56

or for the time series:

:formula_57

The overlapping estimators have far superior performance over the non-overlapping estimators, as &quot;n&quot; rises and the time-series is of moderate length. The overlapped estimators have been accepted as the preferred Allan variance estimators in IEEE, ITU-T and ETSI standards for comparable measurements such as needed for telecommunication qualification.

===Modified Allan variance===
In order to address the inability to separate white phase modulation from flicker phase modulation using traditional Allan variance estimators, an algorithmic filtering reduces the bandwidth by &quot;n&quot;. This filtering provides a modification to the definition and estimators and it now identifies as a separate class of variance called modified Allan variance. The modified Allan variance measure is a frequency stability measure, just as is the Allan variance.

===Time stability estimators===
A time stability (σ&quot;x&quot;) statistical measure, which is often called the time deviation (TDEV), can be calculated from the modified Allan deviation (MDEV). The TDEV is based on the MDEV instead of the original Allan deviation, because the MDEV can discriminate between white and flicker phase modulation (PM). The following is the time variance estimation based on the modified Allan variance:

:formula_58

and similarly for modified Allan deviation to time deviation:

:formula_59

The TDEV is normalized so that it is equal to the classical deviation for white PM for time constant &quot;τ&quot; = &quot;τ&quot;0. To understand the normalization scale factor between the statistical measures, the following is the relevant statistical rule: For independent random variables &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, the variance (σ&quot;z&quot;2) of a sum or difference (&quot;z&quot; = &quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot;) is the sum square of their variances (σ&quot;z&quot;2 = σ&quot;x&quot;2 + σ&quot;y&quot;2). The variance of the sum or difference (&quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;2&quot;τ&quot; − &quot;x&quot;&quot;τ&quot;) of two independent samples of a random variable is twice the variance of the random variable (σ&quot;y&quot;2 = 2σ&quot;x&quot;2). The MDEV is the second difference of independent phase measurements (&quot;x&quot;) that have a variance (σ&quot;x&quot;2). Since the calculation is the double difference, which requires three independent phase measurements (&quot;x&quot;2&quot;τ&quot; − 2&quot;x&quot;&quot;τ&quot; + &quot;x&quot;), the modified Allan variance (MVAR) is three times the variances of the phase measurements.

===Other estimators===
Further developments have produced improved estimation methods for the same stability measure, the variance/deviation of frequency, but these are known by separate names such as the Hadamard variance, modified Hadamard variance, the total variance, modified total variance and the Theo variance. These distinguish themselves in better use of statistics for improved confidence bounds or ability to handle linear frequency drift.

==Confidence intervals and equivalent degrees of freedom==
Statistical estimators will calculate an estimated value on the sample series used. The estimates may deviate from the true value and the range of values which for some probability will contain the true value is referred to as the confidence interval. The confidence interval depends on the number of observations in the sample series, the dominant noise type, and the estimator being used. The width is also dependent on the statistical certainty for which the confidence interval values forms a bounded range, thus the statistical certainty that the true value is within that range of values. For variable-&quot;τ&quot; estimators, the &quot;τ&quot;0 multiple &quot;n&quot; is also a variable.

===Confidence interval===
The confidence interval can be established using chi-squared distribution with df degrees of freedom by using the distribution of the sample variance:

:formula_60

where &quot;s&quot;&quot;2&quot; is the sample variance of our estimate, &quot;σ&quot;2 is the true variance value, df is the degrees of freedom for the estimator, and &quot;χ&quot;2 is calculated based on the inverse cummulative density distribution of a &quot;χ&quot;2 with df degrees of freedom. For a 90% probability, covering the range from the 5% to the 95% range on the probability curve, the upper and lower limits can be found using the inequality

:formula_61

which after rearrangement for the true variance becomes

:formula_62

===Effective degrees of freedom===
The degrees of freedom represents the number of free variables capable of contributing to the estimate. Depending on the estimator and noise type, the effective degrees of freedom varies. Estimator formulas depending on &quot;N&quot; (number of total sample points) and &quot;n&quot; (integer multiple of &quot;τ&quot;0) has been found empirically:

==Power-law noise==
The Allan variance will treat various power-law noise types differently, conveniently allowing them to be identified and their strength estimated. As a convention, the measurement system width (high corner frequency) is denoted &quot;f&quot;&quot;H&quot;.
As found in and in modern forms.

The Allan variance is unable to distinguish between WPM and FPM, but is able to resolve the other power-law noise types. In order to distinguish WPM and FPM, the modified Allan variance needs to be employed.

The above formulas assume that

:formula_63

and thus that the bandwidth of the observation time is much lower than the instruments bandwidth. When this condition is not met, all noise forms depend on the instrument&#x27;s bandwidth.

===&quot;α&quot;–&quot;μ&quot; mapping===
The detailed mapping of a phase modulation of the form

:formula_64

where

:formula_65

or frequency modulation of the form

:formula_66

into the Allan variance of the form

:formula_67

can be significantly simplified by providing a mapping between &quot;α&quot; and &quot;μ&quot;. A mapping between &quot;α&quot; and &quot;K&quot;&quot;α&quot; is also presented for convenience:

===General conversion from phase noise===
A signal with spectral phase noise formula_68 with units rad2/Hz can be converted to Allan Variance by

: formula_69

==Linear response==
While Allan variance is intended to be used to distinguish noise forms, it will depend on some but not all linear responses to time. They are given in the table:

Thus, linear drift will contribute to output result. When measuring a real system, the linear drift or other drift mechanism may need to be estimated and removed from the time-series prior to calculating the Allan variance.

==Time and frequency filter properties==
In analysing the properties of Allan variance and friends, it has proven useful to consider the filter properties on the normalize frequency. Starting with the definition for Allan variance for

:formula_70

where

:formula_71

Replacing the time series of formula_72 with the Fourier-transformed variant formula_73 the Allan variance can be expressed in the frequency domain as

:formula_74

Thus the transfer function for Allan variance is

:formula_75

==Bias functions==
The &quot;M&quot;-sample variance, and the defined special case Allan variance, will experience systematic bias depending on different number of samples &quot;M&quot; and different relationship between &quot;T&quot; and &quot;τ&quot;. In order to address these biases the bias-functions &quot;B&quot;1 and &quot;B&quot;2 has been defined and allows conversion between different &quot;M&quot; and &quot;T&quot; values.

These bias functions are not sufficient for handling the bias resulting from concatenating &quot;M&quot; samples to the &quot;Mτ&quot;0 observation time over the &quot;MT&quot;0 with the dead-time distributed among the &quot;M&quot; measurement blocks rather than at the end of the measurement. This rendered the need for the &quot;B&quot;3 bias.

The bias functions are evaluated for a particular μ value, so the α–μ mapping needs to be done for the dominant noise form as found using noise identification. Alternatively, the μ value of the dominant noise form may be inferred from the measurements using the bias functions.

===&quot;B&quot;1 bias function===
The &quot;B&quot;1 bias function relates the &quot;M&quot;-sample variance with the 2-sample variance, keeping the time between measurements &quot;T&quot; and time for each measurements &quot;τ&quot; constant. It is defined as

:formula_76

where

:formula_77

The bias function becomes after analysis

:formula_78

===&quot;B&quot;2 bias function===
The &quot;B&quot;2 bias function relates the 2-sample variance for sample time &quot;T&quot; with the 2-sample variance (Allan variance), keeping the number of samples &quot;N&quot; = 2 and the observation time &quot;τ&quot; constant. It is defined as

:formula_79

where

:formula_77

The bias function becomes after analysis

:formula_81

===&quot;B&quot;3 bias function===
The &quot;B&quot;3 bias function relates the 2-sample variance for sample time &quot;MT&quot;0 and observation time &quot;Mτ&quot;0 with the 2-sample variance (Allan variance) and is defined as

:formula_82

where
:formula_83
:formula_84

The &quot;B&quot;3 bias function is useful to adjust non-overlapping and overlapping variable &quot;τ&quot; estimator values based on dead-time measurements of observation time &quot;τ&quot;0 and time between observations &quot;T&quot;0 to normal dead-time estimates.

The bias function becomes after analysis (for the &quot;N&quot; = 2 case)

: formula_85

where

: formula_86

===&quot;τ&quot; bias function===
While formally not formulated, it has been indirectly inferred as a consequence of the &quot;α&quot;–&quot;μ&quot; mapping. When comparing two Allan variance measure for different &quot;τ&quot;, assuming same dominant noise in the form of same μ coefficient, a bias can be defined as

:formula_87

The bias function becomes after analysis

:formula_88

===Conversion between values===
In order to convert from one set of measurements to another the &quot;B&quot;1, &quot;B&quot;2 and τ bias functions can be assembled. First the &quot;B&quot;1 function converts the (&quot;N&quot;1, &quot;T&quot;1, &quot;τ&quot;1) value into (2, &quot;T&quot;1, &quot;τ&quot;1), from which the &quot;B&quot;2 function converts into a (2, &quot;τ&quot;1, &quot;τ&quot;1) value, thus the Allan variance at &quot;τ&quot;1. The Allan variance measure can be converted using the τ bias function from &quot;τ&quot;1 to &quot;τ&quot;2, from which then the (2, &quot;T&quot;2, &quot;τ&quot;2) using &quot;B&quot;2 and then finally using &quot;B&quot;1 into the (&quot;N&quot;2, &quot;T&quot;2, &quot;τ&quot;2) variance. The complete conversion becomes

:formula_89

where
:formula_90
:formula_91

Similarly, for concatenated measurements using &quot;M&quot; sections, the logical extension becomes

:formula_92

==Measurement issues==
When making measurements to calculate Allan variance or Allan deviation, a number of issues may cause the measurements to degenerate. Covered here are the effects specific to Allan variance, where results would be biased.

===Measurement bandwidth limits===
A measurement system is expected to have a bandwidth at or below that of the Nyquist rate, as described within the Shannon–Hartley theorem. As can be seen in the power-law noise formulas, the white and flicker noise modulations both depends on the upper corner frequency formula_93 (these systems is assumed to be low-pass filtered only). Considering the frequency filter property, it can be clearly seen that low-frequency noise has greater impact on the result. For relatively flat phase-modulation noise types (e.g. WPM and FPM), the filtering has relevance, whereas for noise types with greater slope the upper frequency limit becomes of less importance, assuming that the measurement system bandwidth is wide relative the formula_3 as given by

:formula_95

When this assumption is not met, the effective bandwidth formula_93 needs to be notated alongside the measurement. The interested should consult NBS TN394.

If, however, one adjust the bandwidth of the estimator by using integer multiples of the sample time formula_97, then the system bandwidth impact can be reduced to insignificant levels. For telecommunication needs, such methods have been required in order to ensure comparability of measurements and allow some freedom for vendors to do different implementations. The ITU-T Rec. G.813 for the TDEV measurement.

It can be recommended that the first formula_10 multiples be ignored, such that the majority of the detected noise is well within the passband of the measurement systems bandwidth.

Further developments on the Allan variance was performed to let the hardware bandwidth be reduced by software means. This development of a software bandwidth allowed addressing the remaining noise, and the method is now referred to modified Allan variance. This bandwidth reduction technique should not be confused with the enhanced variant of modified Allan variance, which also changes a smoothing filter bandwidth.

===Dead time in measurements===
Many measurement instruments of time and frequency have the stages of arming time, time-base time, processing time and may then re-trigger the arming. The arming time is from the time the arming is triggered to when the start event occurs on the start channel. The time-base then ensures that minimal amount of time goes prior to accepting an event on the stop channel as the stop event. The number of events and time elapsed between the start event and stop event is recorded and presented during the processing time. When the processing occurs (also known as the dwell time), the instrument is usually unable to do another measurement. After the processing has occurred, an instrument in continuous mode triggers the arm circuit again. The time between the stop event and the following start event becomes dead time, during which the signal is not being observed. Such dead time introduces systematic measurement biases, which needs to be compensated for in order to get proper results. For such measurement systems will the time &quot;T&quot; denote the time between the adjacent start events (and thus measurements), while formula_3 denote the time-base length, i.e. the nominal length between the start and stop event of any measurement.

Dead-time effects on measurements have such an impact on the produced result that much study of the field have been done in order to quantify its properties properly. The introduction of zero-dead-time counters removed the need for this analysis. A zero-dead-time counter has the property that the stop event of one measurement is also being used as the start event of the following event. Such counters create a series of event and time timestamp pairs, one for each channel spaced by the time-base. Such measurements have also proved useful in order forms of time-series analysis.

Measurements being performed with dead time can be corrected using the bias function &quot;B&quot;1, &quot;B&quot;2 and &quot;B&quot;3. Thus, dead time as such is not prohibiting the access to the Allan variance, but it makes it more problematic. The dead time must be known, such that the time between samples &quot;T&quot; can be established.

===Measurement length and effective use of samples===
Studying the effect on the confidence intervals that the length &quot;N&quot; of the sample series have and the effect of the variable &quot;τ&quot; parameter &quot;n,&quot; the confidence intervals may become very large since the effective degree of freedom may become small for some combination of &quot;N&quot; and &quot;n&quot; for the dominant noise form (for that &quot;τ&quot;).

The effect may be that the estimated value may be much smaller or much greater than the real value, which may lead to false conclusions of the result.

It is recommended that:

* The confidence interval be plotted along with the data, such that the reader of the plot knows of the statistical uncertainty of the values.
* The length of the sample sequence (i.e. the number of samples &quot;N&quot;) must be kept as high as possible to ensure that confidence interval is small over the &quot;τ&quot; range of interest.
* Estimators providing better degrees of freedom values be used in replacement of the Allan variance estimators or as complementing them where they outperform the Allan variance estimators. Among those the total variance and Theo variance estimators should be considered.
* The &quot;τ&quot; range as swept by the &quot;τ&quot;0 multiplier &quot;n&quot; is limited in the upper end relative &quot;N&quot;, such that the reader of the plot may not be confused by highly unstable estimator values.

===Dominant noise type===
A large number of conversion constants, bias corrections and confidence intervals depends on the dominant noise type. For proper interpretation shall the dominant noise type for the particular &quot;τ&quot; of interest be identified through noise identification. Failing to identify the dominant noise type will produce biased values. Some of these biases may be of several order of magnitude, so it may be of large significance.

===Linear drift===
Systematic effects on the signal is only partly cancelled. Phase and frequency offset is cancelled, but linear drift or other high-degree forms of polynomial phase curves will not be cancelled and thus form a measurement limitation. Curve fitting and removal of systematic offset could be employed. Often removal of linear drift can be sufficient. Use of linear-drift estimators such as the Hadamard variance could also be employed. A linear drift removal could be employed using a moment-based estimator.

===Measurement instrument estimator bias===
Traditional instruments provided only the measurement of single events or event pairs. The introduction of the improved statistical tool of overlapping measurements by J. J. Snyder allowed much improved resolution in frequency readouts, breaking the traditional digits/time-base balance. While such methods is useful for their intended purpose, using such smoothed measurements for Allan variance calculations would give a false impression of high resolution, but for longer &quot;τ&quot; the effect is gradually removed, and the lower-&quot;τ&quot; region of the measurement has biased values. This bias is providing lower values than it should, so it is an overoptimistic (assuming that low numbers is what one wishes) bias, reducing the usability of the measurement rather than improving it. Such smart algorithms can usually be disabled or otherwise circumvented by using time-stamp mode, which is much preferred if available.

==Practical measurements==

While several approaches to measurement of Allan variance can be devised, a simple example may illustrate how measurements can be performed.

===Measurement===
All measurements of Allan variance will in effect be the comparison of two different clocks. Consider a reference clock and a device under test (DUT), and both having a common nominal frequency of 10 MHz. A time-interval counter is being used to measure the time between the rising edge of the reference (channel A) and the rising edge of the device under test.

In order to provide evenly spaced measurements, the reference clock will be divided down to form the measurement rate, triggering the time-interval counter (ARM input). This rate can be 1 Hz (using the 1 PPS output of a reference clock), but other rates like 10 Hz and 100 Hz can also be used. The speed of which the time-interval counter can complete the measurement, output the result and prepare itself for the next arm will limit the trigger frequency.

A computer is then useful to record the series of time differences being observed.

===Post-processing===
The recorded time-series require post-processing to unwrap the wrapped phase, such that a continuous phase error is being provided. If necessary, logging and measurement mistakes should also be fixed. Drift estimation and drift removal should be performed, the drift mechanism needs to be identified and understood for the sources. Drift limitations in measurements can be severe, so letting the oscillators become stabilized, by long enough time being powered on, is necessary.

The Allan variance can then be calculated using the estimators given, and for practical purposes the overlapping estimator should be used due to its superior use of data over the non-overlapping estimator. Other estimators such as total or Theo variance estimators could also be used if bias corrections is applied such that they provide Allan variance-compatible results.

To form the classical plots, the Allan deviation (square root of Allan variance) is plotted in log–log format against the observation interval &quot;τ&quot;.

===Equipment and software===
The time-interval counter is typically an off-the-shelf counter commercially available. Limiting factors involve single-shot resolution, trigger jitter, speed of measurements and stability of reference clock. The computer collection and post-processing can be done using existing commercial or public-domain software. Highly advanced solutions exists, which will provide measurement and computation in one box.

==Research history==
The field of frequency stability has been studied for a long time. However, during the 1960s it was found that coherent definitions were lacking. A NASA-IEEE Symposium on Short-Term Stability in November 1964 resulted in the special February 1966 issue of the IEEE Proceedings on Frequency Stability.

The NASA-IEEE Symposium brought together many fields and uses of short- and long-term stability, with papers from many different contributors. The articles and panel discussions concur on the existence of the frequency flicker noise and the wish to achieve a common definition for both short-term and long-term stability.

Important papers, including those of David Allan, James A. Barnes, L. S. Cutler and C. L. Searle and D. B. Leeson, appeared in the IEEE Proceedings on Frequency Stability and helped shape the field.

David Allan&#x27;s article analyses the classical &quot;M&quot;-sample variance of frequency, tackling the issue of dead-time between measurements along with an initial bias function. Although Allan&#x27;s initial bias function assumes no dead-time, his formulas do include dead-time calculations. His article analyses the case of M frequency samples (called N in the article) and variance estimators. It provides the now standard α–μ mapping, clearly building on James Barnes&#x27; work in the same issue.

The 2-sample variance case is a special case of the &quot;M&quot;-sample variance, which produces an average of the frequency derivative. Allan implicitly uses the 2-sample variance as a base case, since for arbitrary chosen &quot;M&quot;, values may be transferred via the 2-sample variance to the &quot;M&quot;-sample variance. No preference was clearly stated for the 2-sample variance, even if the tools were provided. However, this article laid the foundation for using the 2-sample variance as a way of comparing other &quot;M&quot;-sample variances.

James Barnes significantly extended the work on bias functions, introducing the modern &quot;B&quot;1 and &quot;B&quot;2 bias functions. Curiously enough, it refers to the &quot;M&quot;-sample variance as &quot;Allan variance&quot;, while referring to Allan&#x27;s article &quot;Statistics of Atomic Frequency Standards&quot;. With these modern bias functions, full conversion among &quot;M&quot;-sample variance measures of various &quot;M&quot;, &quot;T&quot; and &quot;τ&quot; values could be performed, by conversion through the 2-sample variance.

James Barnes and David Allan further extended the bias functions with the &quot;B&quot;3 function to handle the concatenated samples estimator bias. This was necessary to handle the new use of concatenated sample observations with dead-time in between.

In 1970, the IEEE Technical Committee on Frequency and Time, within the IEEE Group on Instrumentation &amp; Measurements, provided a summary of the field, published as NBS Technical Notice 394. This paper was first in a line of more educational and practical papers helping fellow engineers grasp the field. This paper recommended the 2-sample variance with &quot;T&quot; = &quot;τ&quot;, referring to it as Allan variance (now without the quotes). The choice of such parametrisation allows good handling of some noise forms and getting comparable measurements; it is essentially the least common denominator with the aid of the bias functions &quot;B&quot;1 and &quot;B&quot;2.

J. J. Snyder proposed an improved method for frequency or variance estimation, using sample statistics for frequency counters. To get more effective degrees of freedom out of the available dataset, the trick is to use overlapping observation periods. This provides a improvement, and was incorporated in the overlapping Allan variance estimator. Variable-τ software processing was also incorporated. This development improved the classical Allan variance estimators, likewise providing a direct inspiration for the work on modified Allan variance.

Howe, Allan and Barnes presented the analysis of confidence intervals, degrees of freedom, and the established estimators.

==Educational and practical resources==
The field of time and frequency and its use of Allan variance, Allan deviation and friends is a field involving many aspects, for which both understanding of concepts and practical measurements and post-processing requires care and understanding. Thus, there is a realm of educational material stretching about 40 years available. Since these reflect the developments in the research of their time, they focus on teaching different aspect over time, in which case a survey of available resources may be a suitable way of finding the right resource.

The first meaningful summary is the NBS Technical Note 394 &quot;Characterization of Frequency Stability&quot;. This is the product of the Technical Committee on Frequency and Time of the IEEE Group on Instrumentation &amp; Measurement. It gives the first overview of the field, stating the problems, defining the basic supporting definitions and getting into Allan variance, the bias functions &quot;B&quot;1 and &quot;B&quot;2, the conversion of time-domain measures. This is useful, as it is among the first references to tabulate the Allan variance for the five basic noise types.

A classical reference is the NBS Monograph 140 from 1974, which in chapter 8 has &quot;Statistics of Time and Frequency Data Analysis&quot;. This is the extended variant of NBS Technical Note 394 and adds essentially in measurement techniques and practical processing of values.

An important addition will be the &quot;Properties of signal sources and measurement methods&quot;. It covers the effective use of data, confidence intervals, effective degree of freedom, likewise introducing the overlapping Allan variance estimator. It is a highly recommended reading for those topics.

The IEEE standard 1139 &quot;Standard definitions of Physical Quantities for Fundamental Frequency and Time Metrology&quot; is beyond that of a standard a comprehensive reference and educational resource.

A modern book aimed towards telecommunication is Stefano Bregni &quot;Synchronisation of Digital Telecommunication Networks&quot;. This summarises not only the field, but also much of his research in the field up to that point. It aims to include both classical measures and telecommunication-specific measures such as MTIE. It is a handy companion when looking at measurements related to telecommunication standards.

The NIST Special Publication 1065 &quot;Handbook of Frequency Stability Analysis&quot; of W. J. Riley is a recommended reading for anyone wanting to pursue the field. It is rich of references and also covers a wide range of measures, biases and related functions that a modern analyst should have available. Further it describes the overall processing needed for a modern tool.

==Uses==
Allan variance is used as a measure of frequency stability in a variety of precision oscillators, such as crystal oscillators, atomic clocks and frequency-stabilized lasers over a period of a second or more. Short-term stability (under a second) is typically expressed as phase noise. The Allan variance is also used to characterize the bias stability of gyroscopes, including fiber optic gyroscopes, hemispherical resonator gyroscopes and MEMS gyroscopes and accelerometers.

==50th anniversary==
In 2016, IEEE-UFFC is going to be publishing a &quot;Special Issue to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Allan Variance (1966–2016)&quot;. A guest editor for that issue will be David&#x27;s former colleague at NIST, Judah Levine, who is the most recent recipient of the I. I. Rabi Award.

<text>In atmospheric sounding and noise pollution, ambient noise level (sometimes called [[background noise]] level, reference sound level, or room noise level) is the background sound pressure level at a given location, normally specified as a reference level to study a new intrusive sound source.

Ambient sound levels are often measured in order to map sound conditions over a spatial regime to understand their variation with locale. In this case the product of the investigation is a sound level contour map. Alternatively ambient noise levels may be measured to provide a reference point for analyzing an intrusive sound to a given environment. For example, sometimes aircraft noise is studied by measuring ambient sound without presence of any overflights, and then studying the noise addition by measurement or computer simulation of overflight events. Or roadway noise is measured as ambient sound, prior to introducing a hypothetical noise barrier intended to reduce that ambient noise level. 

Ambient noise level is measured with a sound level meter. It is usually measured in dB relative to a reference pressure of 0.00002 Pa, &quot;i.e.,&quot; 20 μPa (micropascals) in SI units. This is because 20 μPa is the faintest sound the human ear can detect. A pascal is a newton per square meter. The centimeter-gram-second system of units, the reference sound pressure for measuring ambient noise level is 0.0002 dyn/cm2, or 0.00002 N/m2. Most frequently ambient noise levels are measured using a frequency weighting filter, the most common being the A-weighting scale, such that resulting measurements are denoted dB(A), or decibels on the A-weighting scale.

<doc id="40713" wikidata="Q4748515" url="?curid=40713" title="Amplitude distortion">
<text>Amplitude distortion is distortion occurring in a system, subsystem, or device when the output amplitude is not a linear function of the input amplitude under specified conditions. 

Generally, output is a linear function of input only for a fixed portion of the transfer characteristics. In this region, Ic=βIb where Ic is collector current and Ib is base current, following linear relation y=mx.

When output is not in this portion, two forms of amplitude distortion might arise
# Harmonic distortion : The creation of harmonics of the fundamental frequency of a sine wave input to a system.
# Intermodulation distortion : This form of distortion occurs when two sine waves of frequencies &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are present at the input, resulting in the creation of several other frequency components, whose frequencies include (X+Y), (X-Y), (2X-Y), (2Y-X), and generally (mX ± nY) for integer m and n. Generally the size of the unwanted output falls rapidly as m and n increase.

Due to the additional outputs, this form of distortion is definitely unwanted in audio, radio and telecommunication amplifiers, and it occurs for more than two waves as well.

In a narrowband system such as a radio communication system, unwanted outputs such as X-Y and 2X+Y will be remote from the wanted band and so be ignored by the system. In contrast, 2X-Y and 2Y-X will be close to the wanted signals. These so-called third order distortion products (third order as m+n = 3) tend to dominate the non-linear distortion of narrowband systems.

Amplitude distortion is measured with the system operating under steady-state conditions with a sinusoidal input signal. When other frequencies are present, the term &quot;amplitude&quot; refers to that of the fundamental only.

<text>In telecommunications, antenna blind cone (sometimes called a cone of silence or antenna blind spot) is the volume of space, usually approximately conical with its vertex at the antenna, that cannot be scanned by an antenna because of limitations of the antenna radiation pattern and mount.

The concept was encountered as early as the 1950s in low-frequency radio ranges, when it was used to determine when an aircraft was directly over a station. As the signal may not completely fade away, the aircraft&#x27;s position could be confirmed by listening for a station location, or &quot;Z&quot;, marker.

An Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR) is an example of an antenna blind cone. The horizontal radiation pattern of an ARSR antenna is very narrow, and the vertical radiation pattern is fan-shaped, reaching approximately 70° of elevation above the horizontal plane. As the fan antenna is rotated about a vertical axis, it can illuminate targets only if they are 70° or less from the horizontal plane. Above that elevation, they are in the antenna blind cone.

The antenna blind cone is also referred to as the &quot;cone of silence&quot;, especially in America. This term is also used for weather radars. NEXRAD radars make two-dimensional scans at varying angles ranging from 0.5° above level to 19.5° above level (during a significant weather event). These levels become much closer to the ground, and closer to each other, as they get closer to the radar site, rendering them of little use for the three-dimensional profiling such multi-level scanning is meant to provide. Thus, a weather event located very close to and/or directly overhead of the radar site will be mostly situated in the &quot;cone of silence.&quot; This is part of the reason why most U.S. weather radars partially overlap each other&#x27;s territories.

<text>In radio frequency (RF) applications such as radio, radar and telecommunications, noise temperature of an antenna is a measure of the noise power density contributed by the antenna to the overall RF receiver system. It is defined as &quot;the temperature of a resistor having an available thermal noise power per unit bandwidth equal to that at the antenna&#x27;s output at a specified frequency&quot;. In other words, antenna noise temperature is a parameter that describes how much noise an antenna produces in a given environment. This temperature is not the physical temperature of the antenna. Moreover, an antenna does not have an intrinsic &quot;antenna temperature&quot; associated with it; rather the temperature depends on its gain pattern, pointing direction, and the thermal environment that it is placed in.

== Mathematics ==

In RF applications, noise power is defined using the relationship , where &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant, &quot;T&quot; is the noise temperature, and &quot;B&quot; is the noise bandwidth. Typically the noise bandwidth is determined by the bandwidth of the intermediate frequency (IF) filter of the radio receiver. Thus, we can define the noise temperature as:
: formula_1
Because &quot;k&quot; is a constant, we can effectively think of &quot;T&quot; as noise power spectral density (with unit W/Hz) normalized by &quot;k&quot;.

Antenna noise is only one of the contributors to the overall noise temperature of an RF receiver system, so it is typically subscripted, such as &quot;T&quot;A. It is added directly to the effective noise temperature of the receiver to obtain the overall system noise temperature:
: formula_2

== Sources of antenna noise ==

Antenna noise temperature has contributions from many sources, including:
* Cosmic microwave background radiation
* Galactic radiation
* Earth heating
* The Sun
* The Moon
* Electrical devices
* The antenna itself

Galactic noise is high below 1000 MHz. At around 150 MHz, it is approximately 1000 K. At 2500 MHz, it has leveled off to around 10 K.

Earth has an accepted standard temperature of 288 K.

The level of the Sun&#x27;s contribution depends on the solar flux. It is given by
: formula_3
where formula_4 is the solar flux,
: formula_5 is the wavelength,
and formula_6 is the logarithmic gain of the antenna in decibels.

The antenna noise temperature depends on antenna coupling to all noise sources in its environment as well as on noise generated within the antenna. That is, in a directional antenna, the portion of the noise source that the antenna&#x27;s main and side lobes intersect contribute proportionally.

For example, a satellite antenna may not receive noise contribution from the Earth in its main lobe, but sidelobes will contribute a portion of the 288 K Earth noise to its overall noise temperature.

<doc id="40725" wikidata="Q4791137" url="?curid=40725" title="Arithmetic shift">
<text>In computer programming, an arithmetic shift is a shift operator, sometimes termed a signed shift (though it is not restricted to signed operands). The two basic types are the arithmetic left shift and the arithmetic right shift. For binary numbers it is a bitwise operation that shifts all of the bits of its operand; every bit in the operand is simply moved a given number of bit positions, and the vacant bit-positions are filled in. Instead of being filled with all 0s, as in logical shift, when shifting to the right, the leftmost bit (usually the sign bit in signed integer representations) is replicated to fill in all the vacant positions (this is a kind of sign extension).

Some authors prefer the terms &quot;sticky right-shift&quot; and &quot;zero-fill right-shift&quot; for arithmetic and logical shifts respectively.

Arithmetic shifts can be useful as efficient ways to perform multiplication or division of signed integers by powers of two. Shifting left by &quot;n&quot; bits on a signed or unsigned binary number has the effect of multiplying it by 2&quot;n&quot;. Shifting right by &quot;n&quot; bits on a two&#x27;s complement &quot;signed&quot; binary number has the effect of dividing it by 2&quot;n&quot;, but it always rounds down (towards negative infinity). This is different from the way rounding is usually done in signed integer division (which rounds towards 0). This discrepancy has led to bugs in a number of compilers.

For example, in the x86 instruction set, the SAR instruction (arithmetic right shift) divides a signed number by a power of two, rounding towards negative infinity. However, the IDIV instruction (signed divide) divides a signed number, rounding towards zero. So a SAR instruction cannot be substituted for an IDIV by power of two instruction nor vice versa.

== Formal definition ==
The formal definition of an arithmetic shift, from Federal Standard 1037C is that it is:
An important word in the FS 1073C definition is &quot;usually&quot;.

=== Non-equivalence of arithmetic right shift and division ===
However, arithmetic &quot;right&quot; shifts are major traps for the unwary, specifically in treating rounding of negative integers. For example, in the usual two&#x27;s complement representation of negative integers, −1 is represented as all 1&#x27;s. For an 8-bit signed integer this is 1111 1111. An arithmetic right-shift by 1 (or 2, 3, ..., 7) yields 1111 1111 again, which is still −1. This corresponds to rounding down (towards negative infinity), but is not the usual convention for division.

It is frequently stated that arithmetic right shifts are equivalent to division by a (positive, integral) power of the radix (e.g., a division by a power of 2 for binary numbers), and hence that division by a power of the radix can be optimized by implementing it as an arithmetic right shift. (A shifter is much simpler than a divider. On most processors, shift instructions will execute faster than division instructions.) Large number of 1960s and 1970s programming handbooks, manuals, and other specifications from companies and institutions such as DEC, IBM, Data General, and ANSI make such incorrect statements.

Logical right shifts are equivalent to division by a power of the radix (usually 2) only for positive or unsigned numbers. Arithmetic right shifts are equivalent to logical right shifts for positive signed numbers. Arithmetic right shifts for negative numbers in N&#x27;s complement (usually two&#x27;s complement) is roughly equivalent to division by a power of the radix (usually 2), where for odd numbers rounding downwards is applied (not towards 0 as usually expected).

Arithmetic right shifts for negative numbers are equivalent to division using rounding towards 0 in ones&#x27; complement representation of signed numbers as was used by some historic computers, but this is no longer in general use.

==== Handling the issue in programming languages ====

The (1999) ISO standard for the programming language C defines the right shift operator in terms of divisions by powers of 2. Because of the above-stated non-equivalence, the standard explicitly excludes from that definition the right shifts of signed numbers that have negative values. It does not specify the behaviour of the right shift operator in such circumstances, but instead requires each individual C compiler to define the behaviour of shifting negative values right.

Like C, C++ had an implementation-defined right shift for signed integers until C++20. Starting in the C++20 standard, right shift of a signed integer is defined to be an arithmetic shift.

== Applications ==
In applications where consistent rounding down is desired, arithmetic right shifts for signed values are useful. An example is in downscaling raster coordinates by a power of two, which maintains even spacing. For example, right shift by 1 sends 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, ..., and −1, −2, −3, −4, ... to −1, −1, −2, −2, ..., maintaining even spacing as −2, −2, −1, −1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, ... In contrast, integer division with rounding towards zero sends −1, 0, and 1 all to 0 (3 points instead of 2), yielding −2, −1, −1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, ... instead, which is irregular at 0.

<text>Automatic repeat request (ARQ), also known as automatic repeat query, is an error-control method for data transmission that uses acknowledgements (messages sent by the receiver indicating that it has correctly received a message) and timeouts (specified periods of time allowed to elapse before an acknowledgment is to be received) to achieve reliable data transmission over an unreliable communication channel. ARQ is appropriate if the communication channel has varying or unknown capacity. If the sender does not receive an acknowledgment before the timeout, it re-transmits the message until it receives an acknowledgment or exceeds a predefined number of retransmissions. 

Variations of ARQ protocols include Stop-and-wait ARQ, Go-Back-N ARQ, and Selective Repeat ARQ. All three protocols usually use some form of sliding window protocol to help the sender determine which (if any) packets need to be retransmitted. These protocols reside in the data link or transport layers (layers 2 and 4) of the OSI model.

==Examples==
The Transmission Control Protocol uses a variant of Go-Back-N ARQ to ensure reliable transmission of data over the Internet Protocol, which does not provide guaranteed delivery of packets; with Selective Acknowledgement (SACK), it uses Selective Repeat ARQ.

IEEE 802.11 wireless networking uses ARQ retransmissions at the data-link layer.

ITU-T G.hn uses hybrid ARQ, a mixture of high-rate forward error correction (FEC) and ARQ. It is a high-speed local area network standard that can operate at data rates up to 1 Gbit/s over existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables). G.hn uses CRC-32C for Error Detection, LDPC for FEC and selective repeat for ARQ.

ARQ systems were widely used on shortwave radio to ensure reliable delivery of data such as for telegrams. These systems came in forms called ARQ-E and ARQ-M, which also included the ability to multiplex two or four channels.

A number of patents exist for the use of ARQ in live video contribution environments. In these high throughput environments negative acknowledgements are used to drive down overheads.

<text>In telecommunications, an artificial transmission line is a two-port electrical network that has the characteristic impedance, transmission time delay, phase shift, or other parameter(s) of a real transmission line. It can be used to simulate a real transmission line in one or more of these respects.

Early artificial lines were used in telephony research and took the form of a cascade of lattice phase equalisers to provide the necessary delay. The lattice phase circuit was invented by Otto Zobel in the 1920s.

<doc id="40732" wikidata="Q4817109" url="?curid=40732" title="Atmospheric duct">
<text>In telecommunications, an atmospheric duct is a horizontal layer in the lower atmosphere in which the vertical refractive index gradients are such that radio signals (and light rays) are guided or ducted, tend to follow the curvature of the Earth, and experience less attenuation in the ducts than they would if the ducts were not present. The duct acts as an atmospheric dielectric waveguide and limits the spread of the wavefront to only the horizontal dimension.

Atmospheric ducting is a mode of propagation of electromagnetic radiation, usually in the lower layers of Earth’s atmosphere, where the waves are bent by atmospheric refraction. In over-the-horizon radar, ducting causes part of the radiated and target-reflection energy of a radar system to be guided over distances far greater than the normal radar range. It also causes long-distance propagation of radio signals in bands that would normally be limited to line of sight.

Normally radio &quot;ground waves&quot; propagate along the surface as creeping waves. That is, they are only diffracted around the curvature of the earth. This is one reason that early long-distance radio communication used long wavelengths. The best known exception is that HF (3–30 MHz.) waves are reflected by the ionosphere.

The reduced refractive index due to lower densities at the higher altitudes in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere bends the signals back toward the Earth. Signals in a higher refractive index layer, &quot;i.e.,&quot; duct, tend to remain in that layer because of the reflection and refraction encountered at the boundary with a lower refractive index material. In some weather conditions, such as inversion layers, density changes so rapidly that waves are guided around the curvature of the earth at constant altitude.

Phenomena of atmospheric optics related to atmospheric ducting include the green flash, Fata Morgana, superior mirage, mock mirage of astronomical objects and the Novaya Zemlya effect.

<doc id="40735" wikidata="Q2357982" url="?curid=40735" title="Attenuation">
<text>In physics, attenuation (in some contexts, extinction) is the gradual loss of flux intensity through a medium. For instance, dark glasses attenuate sunlight, lead attenuates X-rays, and water and air attenuate both light and sound at variable attenuation rates.

Hearing protectors help reduce acoustic flux from flowing into the ears. This phenomenon is called acoustic attenuation and is measured in decibels (dBs).

In electrical engineering and telecommunications, attenuation affects the propagation of waves and signals in electrical circuits, in optical fibers, and in air. Electrical attenuators and optical attenuators are commonly manufactured components in this field.

== Background ==

In many cases, attenuation is an exponential function of the path length through the medium. In optics and in chemical spectroscopy, this is known as the Beer–Lambert law. In engineering, attenuation is usually measured in units of decibels per unit length of medium (dB/cm, dB/km, etc.) and is represented by the attenuation coefficient of the medium in question. Attenuation also occurs in earthquakes; when the seismic waves move farther away from the hypocenter, they grow smaller as they are attenuated by the ground.

== Ultrasound ==

One area of research in which attenuation plays a prominent role, is in ultrasound physics. Attenuation in ultrasound is the reduction in amplitude of the ultrasound beam as a function of distance through the imaging medium. Accounting for attenuation effects in ultrasound is important because a reduced signal amplitude can affect the quality of the image produced. By knowing the attenuation that an ultrasound beam experiences traveling through a medium, one can adjust the input signal amplitude to compensate for any loss of energy at the desired imaging depth.

*&quot;Ultrasound attenuation&quot; measurement in heterogeneous systems, like emulsions or colloids, yields information on particle size distribution. There is an ISO standard on this technique.
*&quot;Ultrasound attenuation&quot; can be used for extensional rheology measurement. There are acoustic rheometers that employ Stokes&#x27; law for measuring extensional viscosity and volume viscosity.

Wave equations which take acoustic attenuation into account can be written on a fractional derivative form.

In homogeneous media, the main physical properties contributing to sound attenuation are viscosity and thermal conductivity.

=== Attenuation coefficient ===

Attenuation coefficients are used to quantify different media according to how strongly the transmitted ultrasound amplitude decreases as a function of frequency. The attenuation coefficient (formula_1) can be used to determine total attenuation in dB in the medium using the following formula:
: formula_2

Attenuation is linearly dependent on the medium length and attenuation coefficient, as well as – approximately – the frequency of the incident ultrasound beam for biological tissue (while for simpler media, such as air, the relationship is quadratic). Attenuation coefficients vary widely for different media. In biomedical ultrasound imaging however, biological materials and water are the most commonly used media. The attenuation coefficients of common biological materials at a frequency of 1 MHz are listed below:

There are two general ways of acoustic energy losses: absorption and scattering.
Ultrasound propagation through homogeneous media is associated only with absorption and can be characterized with absorption coefficient only. Propagation through heterogeneous media requires taking into account scattering.

== Light attenuation in water ==

Shortwave radiation emitted from the Sun have wavelengths in the visible spectrum of light that range from 360 nm (violet) to 750 nm (red). When the Sun&#x27;s radiation reaches the sea surface, the shortwave radiation is attenuated by the water, and the intensity of light decreases exponentially with water depth. The intensity of light at depth can be calculated using the Beer-Lambert Law.

In clear mid-ocean waters, visible light is absorbed most strongly at the longest wavelengths. Thus, red, orange, and yellow wavelengths are totally absorbed at shallower depths, while blue and violet wavelengths reach deeper in the water column. Because the blue and violet wavelengths are absorbed least compared to the other wavelengths, open-ocean waters appear deep blue to the eye.

Near the shore, coastal water contains more phytoplankton than the very clear mid-ocean waters. Chlorophyll-a pigments in the phytoplankton absorb light, and the plants themselves scatter light, making coastal waters less clear than mid-ocean waters. Chlorophyll-a absorbs light most strongly in the shortest wavelengths (blue and violet) of the visible spectrum. In coastal waters where high concentrations of phytoplankton occur, the green wavelength reaches the deepest in the water column and the color of water appears blue-green or green.

== Seismic ==
The energy with which an earthquake affects a location depends on the running distance. The attenuation in the signal of ground motion intensity plays an important role in the assessment of possible strong groundshaking. A seismic wave loses energy as it propagates through the earth (seismic attenuation). This phenomenon is tied into the dispersion of the seismic energy with the distance. There are two types of dissipated energy:

* geometric dispersion caused by distribution of the seismic energy to greater volumes
* dispersion as heat, also called intrinsic attenuation or anelastic attenuation.

In porous fluid—saturated sedimentary rocks such as sandstones, intrinsic attenuation of seismic waves is primarily caused by the wave-induced flow of the pore fluid relative to the solid frame.
== Electromagnetic ==
Attenuation decreases the intensity of electromagnetic radiation due to absorption or scattering of photons. Attenuation does not include the decrease in intensity due to inverse-square law geometric spreading. Therefore, calculation of the total change in intensity involves both the inverse-square law and an estimation of attenuation over the path.

The primary causes of attenuation in matter are the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and, for photon energies of above 1.022 MeV, pair production.

=== Coaxial and general RF cables ===
The attenuation of RF cables is defined by:
: formula_3
where formula_4 is the input power into a 100 m long cable terminated with the nominal value of its characteristic impedance, and
formula_5 is the output power at the far end of this cable.

Attenuation in a coaxial cable is a function of the materials and the construction.

=== Radiography ===
The beam of X-ray is attenuated when photons are absorbed when the x-ray beam passes through the tissue. Interaction with matter varies between high energy photons and low energy photons. Photons travelling at higher energy are more capable of travelling through a tissue specimen as they have less chances of interacting with matter. This is mainly due to the photoelectric effect which states that &quot;the probability of photoelectric absorption is approximately proportional to (Z/E)3, where Z is the atomic number of the tissue atom and E is the photon energy. In context of this, an increase in photon energy (E) will result in a rapid decrease in the interaction with matter.

=== Optics ===
Attenuation in fiber optics, also known as transmission loss, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) with respect to distance travelled through a transmission medium. Attenuation coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the relatively high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission. The medium is typically a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. Attenuation is an important factor limiting the transmission of a digital signal across large distances. Thus, much research has gone into both limiting the attenuation and maximizing the amplification of the optical signal.
Empirical research has shown that attenuation in optical fiber is caused primarily by both scattering and absorption.

Attenuation in fiber optics can be quantified using the following equation:

: formula_6

==== Light scattering ====

The propagation of light through the core of an optical fiber is based on total internal reflection of the lightwave. Rough and irregular surfaces, even at the molecular level of the glass, can cause light rays to be reflected in many random directions. This type of reflection is referred to as &quot;diffuse reflection&quot;, and it is typically characterized by wide variety of reflection angles. Most objects that can be seen with the naked eye are visible due to diffuse reflection. Another term commonly used for this type of reflection is &quot;light scattering&quot;. Light scattering from the surfaces of objects is our primary mechanism of physical observation.
Light scattering from many common surfaces can be modelled by reflectance.

Light scattering depends on the wavelength of the light being scattered. Thus, limits to spatial scales of visibility arise, depending on the frequency of the incident lightwave and the physical dimension (or spatial scale) of the scattering center, which is typically in the form of some specific microstructural feature. For example, since visible light has a wavelength scale on the order of one micrometer, scattering centers will have dimensions on a similar spatial scale.

Thus, attenuation results from the incoherent scattering of light at internal surfaces and interfaces. In (poly)crystalline materials such as metals and ceramics, in addition to pores, most of the internal surfaces or interfaces are in the form of grain boundaries that separate tiny regions of crystalline order. It has recently been shown that, when the size of the scattering center (or grain boundary) is reduced below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent. This phenomenon has given rise to the production of transparent ceramic materials.

Likewise, the scattering of light in optical quality glass fiber is caused by molecular-level irregularities (compositional fluctuations) in the glass structure. Indeed, one emerging school of thought is that a glass is simply the limiting case of a polycrystalline solid. Within this framework, &quot;domains&quot; exhibiting various degrees of short-range order become the building-blocks of both metals and alloys, as well as glasses and ceramics. Distributed both between and within these domains are microstructural defects that will provide the most ideal locations for the occurrence of light scattering. This same phenomenon is seen as one of the limiting factors in the transparency of IR missile domes.

==== UV-Vis-IR absorption ====
In addition to light scattering, attenuation or signal loss can also occur due to selective absorption of specific wavelengths, in a manner similar to that responsible for the appearance of color. Primary material considerations include both electrons and molecules as follows:

* At the electronic level, it depends on whether the electron orbitals are spaced (or &quot;quantized&quot;) such that they can absorb a quantum of light (or photon) of a specific wavelength or frequency in the ultraviolet (UV) or visible ranges. This is what gives rise to color.
* At the atomic or molecular level, it depends on the frequencies of atomic or molecular vibrations or chemical bonds, how close-packed its atoms or molecules are, and whether or not the atoms or molecules exhibit long-range order. These factors will determine the capacity of the material transmitting longer wavelengths in the infrared (IR), far IR, radio and microwave ranges.

The selective absorption of infrared (IR) light by a particular material occurs because the selected frequency of the light wave matches the frequency (or an integral multiple of the frequency) at which the particles of that material vibrate. Since different atoms and molecules have different natural frequencies of vibration, they will selectively absorb different frequencies (or portions of the spectrum) of infrared (IR) light.

=== Applications ===
In optical fibers, attenuation is the rate at which the signal light decreases in intensity. For this reason, glass fiber (which has a low attenuation) is used for long-distance fiber optic cables; plastic fiber has a higher attenuation and, hence, shorter range. There also exist optical attenuators that decrease the signal in a fiber optic cable intentionally.

Attenuation of light is also important in physical oceanography. This same effect is an important consideration in weather radar, as raindrops absorb a part of the emitted beam that is more or less significant, depending on the wavelength used.

Due to the damaging effects of high-energy photons, it is necessary to know how much energy is deposited in tissue during diagnostic treatments involving such radiation. In addition, gamma radiation is used in cancer treatments where it is important to know how much energy will be deposited in healthy and in tumorous tissue.

In computer graphics attenuation defines the local or global influence of light sources and force fields.

In CT imaging, attenuation describes the density or darkness of the image.

=== Radio ===

Attenuation is an important consideration in the modern world of wireless telecommunications. Attenuation limits the range of radio signals and is affected by the materials a signal must travel through (e.g., air, wood, concrete, rain).

<doc id="40741" wikidata="Q16975727" url="?curid=40741" title="Audit (telecommunication)">
<text>In telecommunications, an audit is one of:

* The act of conducting a review, examination and reconciliation of Telecom, Wireless and Network customer service records, invoicing and contract agreements in order to ensure the accuracy of budgetary forecasting.
* Independent review and examination of records and activities to assess the adequacy of system controls, to ensure compliance with established policies and operational procedures, and to recommend necessary changes in controls, policies, or procedures.
* Analysis of invoices, lines, rates, tariffs, taxes, plans, usage, call volume, systems, and contracts resulting in cost reduction, proper invoicing and optimization of telecommunication systems often conducted by an independent telecommunications consultant or firm.

The simplest audits consist of comparing current telecommunications billing and usage to the underlying rate structure whether that is dictated by contract, tariff, or price list. Complex audits utilize software applications, direct bargaining with service providers and activity reports that include detail down to an individual employee&#x27;s usage.

== Auditing methods and consultants ==
In business, companies with significant telecommunications costs or a telecommunications focus normally either conduct audits internally or hire a consultant. No matter the method, typical audits encompass one or more of the following:

*Telecom Expense Management (TEM): An ongoing analysis and adjustment of internal telecommunications procedures and billing designed to maximize savings. See also Wireless Expense Management
*Telecom RFP (Request For Proposals): A proposed management plan designed to maximize efficiency, security and reliability in the business&#x27; communications. Consultants typically present an RFP for approval by their clients.
*Management and Reporting: Ongoing telecommunications cost and activity analytics. Internal auditors and consultants both use software as part of the process: either a generalized database application or specialized applications designed for auditing.

Telecom audits can encompass every communications service that a business expends its budget on. Audits may focus on mobile phones and devices, Internet service or land line telephony, or they may encompass all three.

== Current methods ==
Internal Audit: A business accounting department will generally only conduct a telecom bill review in the months that trigger a red flag due to the sudden spike in the expense of a communications service. This is usually contained to the one telecom service provider who triggered the red flag and the rest of the invoices are left unexamined because they fall within the considered norm of a small monthly cost increase.

Contingency Fee Based Audit: 
*In exchange for telecom consulting and bill auditing services a business can pay a percentage of all savings realized. 
*Business Process Outsourcing BPO, telecom consultant companies can provide a contingency fee based independent review and examination of records and activities to assess the compliance of telecom service providers with telecommunication contracts and State and Federal Tariffs.

<doc id="40742" wikidata="Q1047174" url="?curid=40742" title="Audit trail">
<text>An audit trail (also called audit log) is a security-relevant chronological record, set of records, and/or destination and source of records that provide documentary evidence of the sequence of activities that have affected at any time a specific operation, procedure, event, or device. Audit records typically result from activities such as financial transactions, scientific research and health care data transactions, or communications by individual people, systems, accounts, or other entities.

The process that creates an audit trail is typically required to always run in a privileged mode, so it can access and supervise all actions from all users; a normal user should not be allowed to stop/change it. Furthermore, for the same reason, the trail file or database table with a trail should not be accessible to normal users. Another way of handling this issue is through the use of a role-based security model in the software. The software can operate with the closed-looped controls, or as a &#x27;closed system&#x27;, as required by many companies when using audit trail functionality.

==Industry uses==
In telecommunications, the term means a record of both completed and attempted accesses and service, or data forming a logical path linking a sequence of events, used to trace the transactions that have affected the contents of a record. 

In information or communications security, information audit means a chronological record of system activities to enable the reconstruction and examination of the sequence of events and/or changes in an event. Information put away or transmitted in paired structure that might be depended upon in court. An audit trail is a progression of records of computer data about a working framework, an application, or client exercises. Computer frameworks may have a few audit trails each gave to a specific sort of action. Related to proper apparatuses and systems, audit trails can help with distinguishing security infringement, execution issues and application issues. Routine log audits and investigation are valuable for distinguishing security episodes, approach infringement, fake movement, and operational issues soon after they have happened, and for giving information valuable to settling such issues. Audit logs can likewise be valuable for performing forensic investigation, supporting the associations inside examinations, setting up baselines, and distinguishing operational patterns and long run issues.

In nursing research, it refers to the act of maintaining a running log or journal of decisions relating to a research project, thus making clear the steps taken and changes made to the original protocol.

In accounting, it refers to documentation of detailed transactions supporting summary ledger entries. This documentation may be on paper or on electronic records.

In finance, it refers to an order (any firm indication of a willingness to buy or sell a security) tracking system, or consolidated audit trail, with respect to the trading of securities, that would capture order event information for orders in securities from the time of the receipt of an order, and further documenting the life of the order through the process of routing, modification, cancellation, and execution (in whole or in part) of the order.

In online proofing, it pertains to the version history of a piece of artwork, design, photograph, video, or web design proof in a project.

In clinical research, server based systems such as clinical trial management systems (CTMS) require audit trails. Anything regulatory or QA/QC related also requires audit trails.

In pharmaceutical manufacturing, it is a Good Manufacturing Practice regulatory requirement software generate audit trails, but not all software have audit trail functionality built-in. The first &#x27;generic&#x27; audit trail generating software came out late 2021. The software is called Audit Trail Control, capable of fulfilling regulatory requirements for any software used in pharmaceutical manufacturing.

In voting, a voter-verified paper audit trail is a method of providing feedback to voters using a ballotless voting system.

<text>An authenticator is a means used to confirm a user&#x27;s identity, that is, to perform digital authentication. A person authenticates to a computer system or application by demonstrating that he or she has possession and control of an authenticator. In the simplest case, the authenticator is a common password.

Using the terminology of the NIST Digital Identity Guidelines, the party to be authenticated is called the &quot;claimant&quot; while the party verifying the identity of the claimant is called the &quot;verifier&quot;. When the claimant successfully demonstrates possession and control of one or more authenticators to the verifier through an established authentication protocol, the verifier is able to infer the claimant&#x27;s identity.

==Classification==

Authenticators may be characterized in terms of secrets, factors, and physical forms.

===Authenticator secrets===

Every authenticator is associated with at least one secret that the claimant uses to demonstrate possession and control of the authenticator. Since an attacker could use this secret to impersonate the user, an authenticator secret must be protected from theft or loss.

The type of secret is an important characteristic of the authenticator. There are three basic types of authenticator secret: a memorized secret and two types of cryptographic keys, either a symmetric key or a private key.

====Memorized secret====

A memorized secret is intended to be memorized by the user. A well-known example of a memorized secret is the common password, also called a passcode, a passphrase, or a personal identification number (PIN).

An authenticator secret known to both the claimant and the verifier is called a shared secret. For example, a memorized secret may or may not be shared. A symmetric key is shared by definition. A private key is not shared.

An important type of secret that is both memorized and shared is the password. In the special case of a password, the authenticator is the secret.

====Cryptographic key====

A cryptographic authenticator is one that uses a cryptographic key. Depending on the key material, a cryptographic authenticator may use symmetric-key cryptography or public-key cryptography. Both avoid memorized secrets, and in the case of public-key cryptography, there are no shared secrets as well, which is an important distinction.

Examples of cryptographic authenticators include OATH authenticators and FIDO authenticators. The name OATH is an acronym from the words &quot;Open AuTHentication&quot; while FIDO stands for Fast IDentity Online. Both are the results of an industry-wide collaboration to develop an open reference architecture using open standards to promote the adoption of strong authentication. 

By way of counterexample, a password authenticator is not a cryptographic authenticator. See the #Examples section for details.

=====Symmetric key=====

A symmetric key is a shared secret used to perform symmetric-key cryptography. The claimant stores their copy of the shared key in a dedicated hardware-based authenticator or a software-based authenticator implemented on a smartphone. The verifier holds a copy of the symmetric key.

=====Public-private key pair=====

A public-private key pair is used to perform public-key cryptography. The public key is known to (and trusted by) the verifier while the corresponding private key is bound securely to the authenticator. In the case of a dedicated hardware-based authenticator, the private key never leaves the confines of the authenticator.

===Authenticator factors and forms===

An authenticator is something unique or distinctive to a user (&quot;something that one has&quot;), is activated by either a PIN (&quot;something that one knows&quot;), or is a biometric (&quot;something that is unique to oneself&quot;). An authenticator that provides only one of these factors is called a single-factor authenticator whereas a multi-factor authenticator incorporates two or more factors. A multi-factor authenticator is one way to achieve multi-factor authentication. A combination of two or more single-factor authenticators is not a multi-factor authentication, yet may be suitable in certain conditions.

Authenticators may take a variety of physical forms (except for a memorized secret, which is intangible). One can, for example, hold an authenticator in one&#x27;s hand or wear one on the face, wrist, or finger.

It is convenient to describe an authenticator in terms of its hardware and software components. An authenticator is hardware-based or software-based depending on whether the secret is stored in hardware or software, respectively.

An important type of hardware-based authenticator is called a security key, also called a security token (not to be confused with access tokens, session tokens, or other types of security tokens). A security key stores its secret in hardware, which prevents the secret from being exported. A security key is also resistant to malware since the secret is at no time accessible to software running on the host machine.

A software-based authenticator (sometimes called a software token) may be implemented on a general-purpose electronic device such as a laptop, a tablet computer, or a smartphone. For example, a software-based authenticator implemented as a mobile app on the claimant&#x27;s smartphone is a type of phone-based authenticator. To prevent access to the secret, a software-based authenticator may use a processor&#x27;s trusted execution environment or a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) on the client device.

A platform authenticator is built into a particular client device platform, that is, it is implemented on device. In contrast, a roaming authenticator is a cross-platform authenticator that is implemented off device. A roaming authenticator connects to a device platform via a transport protocol such as USB.

==Examples==

The following sections describe narrow classes of authenticators. For a more comprehensive classification, see the NIST Digital Identity Guidelines.

===Single-factor authenticators===

To use an authenticator, the claimant must explicitly indicate their intent to authenticate. For example, each of the following gestures is sufficient to establish intent:

* The claimant types a password into a password field, or
* The claimant places their finger on a fingerprint reader, or
* The claimant presses a button to indicate approval

The latter is called a test of user presence (TUP). To activate a single-factor authenticator (&quot;something that one has&quot;), the claimant may be required to perform a TUP, which avoids unintended operation of the authenticator.

A password is a secret that is intended to be memorized by the claimant and shared with the verifier. Password authentication is the process whereby the claimant demonstrates knowledge of the password by transmitting it over the network to the verifier. If the transmitted password agrees with the previously shared secret, user authentication is successful.

====OATH OTP====

One-time passwords (OTPs) have been used since the 1980s. In 2004, an Open Authentication Reference Architecture for the secure generation of OTPs was announced at the annual RSA Conference. The Initiative for Open Authentication (OATH) launched a year later. Two IETF standards grew out of this work, the HMAC-based One-time Password (HOTP) algorithm and the Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) algorithm specified by RFC 4226 and RFC 6238, respectively. By OATH OTP, we mean either HOTP or TOTP. OATH certifies conformance with the HOTP and TOTP standards.

A traditional password (&quot;something that one knows&quot;) is often combined with a one-time password (&quot;something that one has&quot;) to provide two-factor authentication. Both the password and the OTP are transmitted over the network to the verifier. If the password agrees with the previously shared secret, and the verifier can confirm the value of the OTP, user authentication is successful.

One-time passwords are generated on demand by a dedicated OATH OTP authenticator that encapsulates a secret that was previously shared with the verifier. Using the authenticator, the claimant generates an OTP using a cryptographic method. The verifier also generates an OTP using the same cryptographic method. If the two OTP values match, the verifier can conclude that the claimant possesses the shared secret.

A well-known example of an OATH authenticator is Google Authenticator, a phone-based authenticator that implements both HOTP and TOTP.

====Mobile Push====

A mobile push authenticator is essentially a native app running on the claimant&#x27;s mobile phone. The app uses public-key cryptography to respond to push notifications. In other words, a mobile push authenticator is a single-factor cryptographic software authenticator. A mobile push authenticator (&quot;something that one has&quot;) is usually combined with a password (&quot;something that one knows&quot;) to provide two-factor authentication. Unlike one-time passwords, mobile push does not require a shared secret beyond the password.

After the claimant authenticates with a password, the verifier makes an out-of-band authentication request to a trusted third party that manages a public-key infrastructure on behalf of the verifier. The trusted third party sends a push notification to the claimant&#x27;s mobile phone. The claimant demonstrates possession and control of the authenticator by pressing a button in the user interface, after which the authenticator responds with a digitally signed assertion. The trusted third party verifies the signature on the assertion and returns an authentication response to the verifier.

The proprietary mobile push authentication protocol runs on an out-of-band secondary channel, which provides flexible deployment options. Since the protocol requires an open network path to the claimant&#x27;s mobile phone, if no such path is available (due to network issues, e.g.), the authentication process can not proceed.

====FIDO U2F====

A FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) authenticator (&quot;something that one has&quot;) is a single-factor cryptographic authenticator that is intended to be used in conjunction with an ordinary web password. Since the authenticator relies on public-key cryptography, U2F does not require an additional shared secret beyond the password.

To access a U2F authenticator, the claimant is required to perform a test of user presence (TUP), which helps prevent unauthorized access to the authenticator&#x27;s functionality. In practice, a TUP consists of a simple button push.

A U2F authenticator interoperates with a conforming web user agent that implements the U2F JavaScript API. A U2F authenticator necessarily implements the CTAP1/U2F protocol, one of the two protocols specified in the FIDO Client to Authenticator Protocol.

Unlike mobile push authentication, the U2F authentication protocol runs entirely on the front channel. Two round trips are required. The first round trip is ordinary password authentication. After the claimant authenticates with a password, the verifier sends a challenge to a conforming browser, which communicates with the U2F authenticator via a custom JavaScript API. After the claimant performs the TUP, the authenticator signs the challenge and returns the signed assertion to the verifier via the browser.

===Multi-factor authenticators===

To use a multi-factor authenticator, the claimant performs full user verification. The multi-factor authenticator (&quot;something that one has&quot;) is activated by a PIN (&quot;something that one knows&quot;), or a biometric (&quot;something that is unique to oneself&quot;; e.g. fingerprint, face or voice recognition&quot;), or some other verification technique.
====ATM card====

To withdraw cash from an automated teller machine (ATM), a bank customer inserts an ATM card into a cash machine and types a Personal Identification Number (PIN). The input PIN is compared to the PIN stored on the card&#x27;s chip. If the two match, the ATM withdrawal can proceed.

Note that an ATM withdrawal involves a memorized secret (i.e., a PIN) but the true value of the secret is not known to the ATM in advance. The machine blindly passes the input PIN to the card, which compares the customer&#x27;s input to the secret PIN stored on the card&#x27;s chip. If the two match, the card reports success to the ATM and the transaction continues.

An ATM card is an example of a multi-factor authenticator. The card itself is &quot;something that one has&quot; while the PIN stored on the card&#x27;s chip is presumably &quot;something that one knows&quot;. Presenting the card to the ATM and demonstrating knowledge of the PIN is a kind of multi-factor authentication.

====Secure Shell====

Secure Shell (SSH) is a client-server protocol that uses public-key cryptography to create a secure channel over the network. In contrast to a traditional password, an SSH key is a cryptographic authenticator. The primary authenticator secret is the SSH private key, which is used by the client to digitally sign a message. The corresponding public key is used by the server to verify the message signature, which confirms that the claimant has possession and control of the private key.

To avoid theft, the SSH private key (&quot;something that one has&quot;) may be encrypted using a passphrase (&quot;something that one knows&quot;). To initiate a two-factor authentication process, the claimant supplies the passphrase to the client system.

Like a password, the SSH passphrase is a memorized secret but that is where the similarity ends. Whereas a password is a shared secret that is transmitted over the network, the SSH passphrase is not shared, and moreover, use of the passphrase is strictly confined to the client system. Authentication via SSH is an example of passwordless authentication since it avoids the transmission of a shared secret over the network. In fact, SSH authentication does not require a shared secret at all.

====FIDO2====

The FIDO U2F protocol standard became the starting point for the FIDO2 Project, a joint effort between the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the FIDO Alliance. Project deliverables include the W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn) standard and the FIDO Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP). Together WebAuthn and CTAP provide a strong authentication solution for the web.

A FIDO2 authenticator, also called a WebAuthn authenticator, uses public-key cryptography to interoperate with a WebAuthn client, that is, a conforming web user agent that implements the WebAuthn JavaScript API. The authenticator may be a platform authenticator, a roaming authenticator, or some combination of the two. For example, a FIDO2 authenticator that implements the CTAP2 protocol is a roaming authenticator that communicates with a WebAuthn client via one or more of the following transport options: USB, near-field communication (NFC), or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Concrete examples of FIDO2 platform authenticators include Windows Hello and the Android operating system.

A FIDO2 authenticator may be used in either single-factor mode or multi-factor mode. In single-factor mode, the authenticator is activated by a simple test of user presence (e.g., a button push). In multi-factor mode, the authenticator (&quot;something that one has&quot;) is activated by either a PIN (&quot;something that one knows&quot;) or a biometric (&quot;something that is unique to oneself&quot;).

==Security code==
First and foremost, strong authentication begins with multi-factor authentication. The best thing one can do to protect a personal online account is to enable multi-factor authentication. There are two ways to achieve multi-factor authentication:

# Use a multi-factor authenticator
# Use a combination of two or more single-factor authenticators

In practice, a common approach is to combine a password authenticator (&quot;something that one knows&quot;) with some other authenticator (&quot;something that one has&quot;) such as a cryptographic authenticator.

Generally speaking, a cryptographic authenticator is preferred over an authenticator that does not use cryptographic methods. All else being equal, a cryptographic authenticator that uses public-key cryptography is better than one that uses symmetric-key cryptography since the latter requires shared keys (which may be stolen or misused).

Again all else being equal, a hardware-based authenticator is better than a software-based authenticator since the authenticator secret is presumably better protected in hardware. This preference is reflected in the NIST requirements outlined in the next section.

===NIST authenticator assurance levels===

NIST defines three levels of assurance with respect to authenticators. The highest authenticator assurance level (AAL3) requires multi-factor authentication using either a multi-factor authenticator or an appropriate combination of single-factor authenticators. At AAL3, at least one of the authenticators must be a cryptographic hardware-based authenticator. Given these basic requirements, possible authenticator combinations used at AAL3 include:

# A multi-factor cryptographic hardware-based authenticator
# A single-factor cryptographic hardware-based authenticator used in conjunction with some other authenticator (such as a password authenticator)

See the NIST Digital Identity Guidelines for further discussion of authenticator assurance levels.

===Restricted authenticators===

Like authenticator assurance levels, the notion of a restricted authenticator is a NIST concept. The term refers to an authenticator with a demonstrated inability to resist attacks, which puts the reliability of the authenticator in doubt. Federal agencies mitigate the use a restricted authenticator by offering subscribers an alternative authenticator that is not restricted and by developing a migration plan in the event that a restricted authenticator is prohibited from use at some point in the future.

Currently, the use of the public switched telephone network is restricted by NIST. In particular, the out-of-band transmission of one-time passwords (OTPs) via recorded voice messages or SMS messages is restricted. Moreover, if an agency chooses to use voice- or SMS-based OTPs, that agency must verify that the OTP is being transmitted to a phone and not an IP address since Voice over IP (VoIP) accounts are not routinely protected with multi-factor authentication.

==Comparison==

It is convenient to use passwords as a basis for comparison since it is widely understood how to use a password. On computer systems, passwords have been used since at least the early 1960s. More generally, passwords have been used since ancient times.

In 2012, Bonneau et al. evaluated two decades of proposals to replace passwords by systematically comparing web passwords to 35 competing authentication schemes in terms of their usability, deployability, and security. (The cited technical report is an extended version of the peer-reviewed paper by the same name.) They found that most schemes do better than passwords on security while &quot;every&quot; scheme does worse than passwords on deployability. In terms of usability, some schemes do better and some schemes do worse than passwords.

Google used the evaluation framework of Bonneau et al. to compare security keys to passwords and one-time passwords. They concluded that security keys are more usable and deployable than one-time passwords, and more secure than both passwords and one-time passwords.

<text>In telecommunications, an automatic callback is a computer telephony calling feature that permits a user, when encountering a busy condition or other condition where the called individual is unavailable, to instruct the system to retain the called number and to establish the call when there is an available line or when the called number is no longer busy. Automatic callback may be implemented in the terminal, in the telephone exchange, or shared between them. Automatic callback is not the same as camp-on.

==Using callback on popular business telephone systems==

<doc id="40749" wikidata="Q1144193" url="?curid=40749" title="Automatic call distributor">
<text>An automated call distribution system, commonly known as automatic call distributor or automatic call dispatcher (ACD), is a telephony device that answers and distributes incoming calls to a specific group of terminals or agents within an organization. ACDs direct calls based on parameters that may include the caller&#x27;s telephone number, the number they dialed, the time of day or a response to an automated voice prompt. Advanced ACD systems may use digital technologies such as computer telephony integration (CTI), computer-supported telecommunications applications (CSTA) or IVR as input to determine the route to a person or voice announcement that will serve the caller. Experts claim that &quot;the invention of ACD technology made the concept of a call centre possible.&quot;

==Background==
A Private Branch Exchange (PBX) is a telephone exchange device that acts as a switchboard to route phone calls within an organisation. This technology developed into Automated Call Distribution systems using computer technology to automatically connect incoming calls to recipients based on programmable logic.

Although ACDs appeared in the 1950s, one of the first large and separate ACDs was a modified 5XB switch used by the New York Telephone Company in the early 1970s to distribute calls among hundreds of 4-1-1 information operators. Robert Hirvela developed and received a patent for technology that was used to create the Rockwell Galaxy Automatic Call Distributor, which was used by Continental Airlines for more than 20 years. Since then, ACDs have integrated incoming call management and voice messaging software into its capabilities.

==Application==
ACD systems route incoming calls to people according to defined rules that may include, for example, the time of day, the day of the week, the geographic location of the caller and the availability of people to respond. The rules should aim to route the call to a person qualified to address the caller&#x27;s needs. Routing can use caller ID, automatic number identification, interactive voice response or dialed number identification services to determine how calls are handled. ACD systems are often found in offices that handle large volumes of incoming phone calls from callers who require assistance at the earliest opportunity, but have no need to talk to a specific person: e.g., customer service representatives or emergency services dispatch centers.

There are several contact routing strategies that can be set up within an algorithm based on a company&#x27;s needs. Skills-based routing is determined by an operator&#x27;s knowledge to handle a caller&#x27;s inquiry. Virtual contact centers can also be used to aggregate the skill sets of agents to help multiple vendors, where all real-time and statistical information can be shared amongst the contact center sites. An additional function for these external routing applications is to enable Computer telephony integration (CTI), which improves efficiency for call center agents by matching incoming phone calls with relevant data via screen pop.

==Distribution methods==

Methods for distributing incoming calls from a queue include
*Linear Call Distribution – Calls are distributed in order, starting at the beginning each time
*Circular/Rotary Call Distribution – Calls are distributed in order, starting with the next in order
*Uniform Call Distribution – Calls are distributed uniformly, starting with the person who has handled the fewest calls
*Simultaneous Call Distribution – Calls are presented to all available extensions simultaneously
*Weighted Call Distribution – Calls are distributed according to a configurable weighting, such as differing skill sets within customer service representatives.
