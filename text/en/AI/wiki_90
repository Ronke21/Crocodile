<text>John Dalton (; 5 or 6 September 1766 – 27 July 1844) was an English chemist, physicist and meteorologist. He introduced the atomic theory into chemistry. He also researched colour blindness; as a result, the umbrella term for red-green congenital colour blindness disorders is &quot;Daltonism&quot; in several languages.

== Early life ==

John Dalton was born on 5 or 6 September 1766 into a Quaker family in Eaglesfield, near Cockermouth, in Cumberland, England. His father was a weaver. He received his early education from his father and from Quaker John Fletcher, who ran a private school in the nearby village of Pardshaw Hall. Dalton&#x27;s family was too poor to support him for long and he began to earn his living, from the age of ten, in the service of wealthy local Quaker Elihu Robinson.

== Early career ==

When he was 15, Dalton joined his older brother Jonathan in running a Quaker school in Kendal, Westmorland, about from his home. Around the age of 23, Dalton may have considered studying law or medicine, but his relatives did not encourage him, perhaps because being a Dissenter, he was barred from attending English universities. He acquired much scientific knowledge from informal instruction by John Gough, a blind philosopher who was gifted in the sciences and arts. At 27, he was appointed teacher of mathematics and natural philosophy at the &quot;Manchester Academy&quot; in Manchester, a dissenting academy (the lineal predecessor, following a number of changes of location, of Harris Manchester College, Oxford). He remained for seven years, until the college&#x27;s worsening financial situation led to his resignation. Dalton began a new career as a private tutor in the same two subjects.

== Scientific work ==

=== Meteorology ===

Dalton&#x27;s early life was influenced by a prominent Quaker, Elihu Robinson, a competent meteorologist and instrument maker, from Eaglesfield, Cumberland, who interested him in problems of mathematics and meteorology. During his years in Kendal, Dalton contributed solutions to problems and answered questions on various subjects in &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Diary&quot; and the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Diary&quot;. In 1787 at age 21 he began his meteorological diary in which, during the succeeding 57 years, he entered more than 200,000 observations. He rediscovered George Hadley&#x27;s theory of atmospheric circulation (now known as the Hadley cell) around this time. In 1793 Dalton&#x27;s first publication, &quot;Meteorological Observations and Essays&quot;, contained the seeds of several of his later discoveries but despite the originality of his treatment, little attention was paid to them by other scholars. A second work by Dalton, &quot;Elements of English Grammar&quot; (or &quot;A new system of grammatical instruction: for the use of schools and academies&quot;), was published in 1801.

==== Measuring mountains ====
After leaving the Lake District, Dalton returned annually to spend his holidays studying meteorology, something which involved a lot of hill-walking. Until the advent of aeroplanes and weather balloons, the only way to make measurements of temperature and humidity at altitude was to climb a mountain. Dalton estimated the height using a barometer. The Ordnance Survey did not publish maps for the Lake District until the 1860s. Before then, Dalton was one of the few authorities on the heights of the region&#x27;s mountains. He was often accompanied by Jonathan Otley, who also made a study of the heights of the local peaks, using Dalton&#x27;s figures as a comparison to check his work. Otley published his information in his map of 1818. Otley became both an assistant and a friend to Dalton.

=== Colour blindness ===
In 1794, shortly after his arrival in Manchester, Dalton was elected a member of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, the &quot;Lit &amp; Phil&quot;, and a few weeks later he communicated his first paper on &quot;Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours&quot;, in which he postulated that shortage in colour perception was caused by discoloration of the liquid medium of the eyeball. As both he and his brother were colour blind, he recognised that the condition must be hereditary.

Although Dalton&#x27;s theory was later disproven, his early research into colour vision deficiency was recognized after his lifetime. Examination of his preserved eyeball in 1995 demonstrated that Dalton had deuteranopia, a type of congenital red-green color blindness in which the gene for medium wavelength sensitive (green) photopsins is missing. Individuals with this form of colour blindness see every colour as mapped to blue, yellow or gray, or, as Dalton wrote in his seminal paper,

=== Gas laws ===
In 1800, Dalton became secretary of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, and in the following year he presented an important series of lectures, entitled &quot;Experimental Essays&quot; on the constitution of mixed gases; the pressure of steam and other vapours at different temperatures in a vacuum and in air; on evaporation; and on the thermal expansion of gases. The four essays, presented between 2 and 30 October 1801, were published in the &quot;Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester&quot; in 1802.

The second essay opens with the remark,

After describing experiments to ascertain the pressure of steam at various points between , Dalton concluded from observations of the vapour pressure of six different liquids, that the variation of vapour pressure for all liquids is equivalent, for the same variation of temperature, reckoning from vapour of any given pressure.

In the fourth essay he remarks,

He enunciated Gay-Lussac&#x27;s law, published in 1802 by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (Gay-Lussac credited the discovery to unpublished work from the 1780s by Jacques Charles). In the two or three years following the lectures, Dalton published several papers on similar topics. &quot;On the Absorption of Gases by Water and other Liquids&quot; (read as a lecture on 21 October 1803, first published in 1805) contained his law of partial pressures now known as Dalton&#x27;s law.

=== Atomic theory ===
Arguably the most important of all Dalton&#x27;s investigations are concerned with the atomic theory in chemistry. While his name is inseparably associated with this theory, the origin of Dalton&#x27;s atomic theory is not fully understood. The theory may have been suggested to him either by researches on ethylene (&quot;olefiant gas&quot;) and methane (&quot;carburetted hydrogen&quot;) or by analysis of nitrous oxide (&quot;protoxide of azote&quot;) and nitrogen dioxide (&quot;deutoxide of azote&quot;), both views resting on the authority of Thomas Thomson.

From 1814 to 1819, Irish chemist William Higgins claimed that Dalton had plagiarised his ideas, but Higgins&#x27; theory did not address relative atomic mass. Recent evidence suggests that Dalton&#x27;s development of thought may have been influenced by the ideas of another Irish chemist Bryan Higgins, who was William&#x27;s uncle. Bryan believed that an atom was a heavy central particle surrounded by an atmosphere of caloric, the supposed substance of heat at the time. The size of the atom was determined by the diameter of the caloric atmosphere. Based on the evidence, Dalton was aware of Bryan&#x27;s theory and adopted very similar ideas and language, but he never acknowledged Bryan&#x27;s anticipation of his caloric model. However, the essential novelty of Dalton&#x27;s atomic theory is that he provided a method of calculating relative atomic weights for the chemical elements, which provides the means for the assignment of molecular formulas for all chemical substances. Neither Bryan nor William Higgins did this, and Dalton&#x27;s priority for that crucial innovation is uncontested.

A study of Dalton&#x27;s laboratory notebooks, discovered in the rooms of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, concluded that so far from Dalton being led by his search for an explanation of the law of multiple proportions to the idea that chemical combination consists in the interaction of atoms of definite and characteristic weight, the idea of atoms arose in his mind as a purely physical concept, forced on him by study of the physical properties of the atmosphere and other gases. The first published indications of this idea are to be found at the end of his paper &quot;On the Absorption of Gases by Water and other Liquids&quot; already mentioned. There he says:

He then proposes relative weights for the atoms of a few elements, without going into further detail. However, a recent study of Dalton&#x27;s laboratory notebook entries concludes he developed the chemical atomic theory in 1803 to reconcile Henry Cavendish’s and Antoine Lavoisier’s analytical data on the composition of nitric acid, not to explain the solubility of gases in water.

The main points of Dalton&#x27;s atomic theory, as it eventually developed, are:
# Elements are made of extremely small particles called atoms.
# Atoms of a given element are identical in size, mass and other properties; atoms of different elements differ in size, mass and other properties.
# Atoms cannot be subdivided, created or destroyed.
# Atoms of different elements combine in simple whole-number ratios to form chemical compounds.
# In chemical reactions, atoms are combined, separated or rearranged.

In his first extended published discussion of the atomic theory (1808), Dalton proposed an additional (and controversial) &quot;rule of greatest simplicity&quot;. This rule could not be independently confirmed, but some such assumption was necessary in order to propose formulas for a few simple molecules, upon which the calculation of atomic weights depended. This rule dictated that if the atoms of two different elements were known to form only a single compound, like hydrogen and oxygen forming water or hydrogen and nitrogen forming ammonia, the molecules of that compound shall be assumed to consist of one atom of each element. For elements that combined in multiple ratios, such as the then-known two oxides of carbon or the three oxides of nitrogen, their combinations were assumed to be the simplest ones possible. For example, if two such combinations are known, one must consist of an atom of each element, and the other must consist of one atom of one element and two atoms of the other.

This was merely an assumption, derived from faith in the simplicity of nature. No evidence was then available to scientists to deduce how many atoms of each element combine to form molecules. But this or some other such rule was absolutely necessary to any incipient theory, since one needed an assumed molecular formula in order to calculate relative atomic weights. Dalton&#x27;s &quot;rule of greatest simplicity&quot; caused him to assume that the formula for water was OH and ammonia was NH, quite different from our modern understanding (H2O, NH3). On the other hand, his simplicity rule led him to propose the correct modern formulas for the two oxides of carbon (CO and CO2). Despite the uncertainty at the heart of Dalton&#x27;s atomic theory, the principles of the theory survived.

=== Relative atomic weights ===

Dalton published his first table of relative atomic weights containing six elements (hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, sulfur and phosphorus), relative to the weight of an atom of hydrogen conventionally taken as 1. Since these were only relative weights, they do not have a unit of weight attached to them. Dalton provided no indication in this paper how he had arrived at these numbers, but in his laboratory notebook, dated 6 September 1803, is a list in which he set out the relative weights of the atoms of a number of elements, derived from analysis of water, ammonia, carbon dioxide, etc. by chemists of the time.

The extension of this idea to substances in general necessarily led him to the law of multiple proportions, and the comparison with experiment brilliantly confirmed his deduction. In the paper &quot;On the Proportion of the Several Gases in the Atmosphere&quot;, read by him in November 1802, the law of multiple proportions appears to be anticipated in the words:

But there is reason to suspect that this sentence may have been added some time after the reading of the paper, which was not published until 1805.

Compounds were listed as binary, ternary, quaternary, etc. (molecules composed of two, three, four, etc. atoms) in the &quot;New System of Chemical Philosophy&quot; depending on the number of atoms a compound had in its simplest, empirical form.

Dalton hypothesised the structure of compounds can be represented in whole number ratios. So, one atom of element X combining with one atom of element Y is a binary compound. Furthermore, one atom of element X combining with two atoms of element Y or vice versa, is a ternary compound. Many of the first compounds listed in the &quot;New System of Chemical Philosophy&quot; correspond to modern views, although many others do not.

Dalton used his own symbols to visually represent the atomic structure of compounds. They were depicted in the &quot;New System of Chemical Philosophy&quot;, where he listed 21 elements and 17 simple molecules.

=== Other investigations ===
Dalton published papers on such diverse topics as rain and dew and the origin of springs (hydrosphere); on heat, the colour of the sky, steam and the reflection and refraction of light; and on the grammatical subjects of the auxiliary verbs and participles of the English language.

=== Experimental approach ===
As an investigator, Dalton was often content with rough and inaccurate instruments, even though better ones were obtainable. Sir Humphry Davy described him as &quot;a very coarse experimenter&quot;, who &quot;almost always found the results he required, trusting to his head rather than his hands.&quot; On the other hand, historians who have replicated some of his crucial experiments have confirmed Dalton&#x27;s skill and precision.

In the preface to the second part of Volume I of his &quot;New System&quot;, he says he had so often been misled by taking for granted the results of others that he determined to write &quot;as little as possible but what I can attest by my own experience&quot;, but this independence he carried so far that it sometimes resembled lack of receptivity. Thus he distrusted, and probably never fully accepted, Gay-Lussac&#x27;s conclusions as to the combining volumes of gases.

He held unconventional views on chlorine. Even after its elementary character had been settled by Davy, he persisted in using the atomic weights he himself had adopted, even when they had been superseded by the more accurate determinations of other chemists.

He always objected to the chemical notation devised by Jöns Jacob Berzelius, although most thought that it was much simpler and more convenient than his own cumbersome system of circular symbols.

== Other publications ==
For &quot;Rees&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot; Dalton contributed articles on Chemistry and Meteorology, but the topics are not known.

He contributed 117 &quot;Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester&quot; from 1817 until his death in 1844 while president of that organisation. Of these the earlier are the most important. In one of them, read in 1814, he explains the principles of volumetric analysis, in which he was one of the earliest researchers. In 1840 a paper on phosphates and arsenates, often regarded as a weaker work, was refused by the Royal Society, and he was so incensed that he published it himself. He took the same course soon afterwards with four other papers, two of which (&quot;On the quantity of acids, bases and salts in different varieties of salts&quot; and &quot;On a new and easy method of analysing sugar&quot;) contain his discovery, regarded by him as second in importance only to atomic theory, that certain anhydrates, when dissolved in water, cause no increase in its volume, his inference being that the salt enters into the pores of the water.

== Public life ==
Even before he had propounded the atomic theory, Dalton had attained a considerable scientific reputation. In 1803, he was chosen to give a series of lectures on natural philosophy at the Royal Institution in London, and he delivered another series of lectures there in 1809–1810. Some witnesses reported that he was deficient in the qualities that make an attractive lecturer, being harsh and indistinct in voice, ineffective in the treatment of his subject, and singularly wanting in the language and power of illustration.

In 1810, Sir Humphry Davy asked him to offer himself as a candidate for the fellowship of the Royal Society, but Dalton declined, possibly for financial reasons. In 1822 he was proposed without his knowledge, and on election paid the usual fee. Six years previously he had been made a corresponding member of the French Académie des Sciences, and in 1830 he was elected as one of its eight foreign associates in place of Davy. In 1833, Earl Grey&#x27;s government conferred on him a pension of £150, raised in 1836 to £300 (equivalent to £ and £ in , respectively). Dalton was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1834.

A young James Prescott Joule, who later studied and published (1843) on the nature of heat and its relationship to mechanical work, was a pupil of Dalton in his last years.

== Personal life ==

Dalton never married and had only a few close friends. As a Quaker, he lived a modest and unassuming personal life.

For the 26 years prior to his death, Dalton lived in a room in the home of the Rev W. Johns, a published botanist, and his wife, in George Street, Manchester. Dalton and Johns died in the same year (1844).

Dalton&#x27;s daily round of laboratory work and tutoring in Manchester was broken only by annual excursions to the Lake District and occasional visits to London. In 1822 he paid a short visit to Paris, where he met many distinguished resident men of science. He attended several of the earlier meetings of the British Association at York, Oxford, Dublin and Bristol.

== Disability and death ==
Dalton suffered a minor stroke in 1837, and a second in 1838 left him with a speech impairment, although he remained able to perform experiments. In May 1844 he had another stroke; on 26 July, while his hand was trembling, he recorded his last meteorological observation. On 27 July, in Manchester, Dalton fell from his bed and was found dead by his attendant.

Dalton was accorded a civic funeral with full honours. His body lay in state in Manchester Town Hall for four days and more than 40,000 people filed past his coffin. The funeral procession included representatives of the city&#x27;s major civic, commercial, and scientific bodies. He was buried in Manchester in Ardwick Cemetery; the cemetery is now a playing field, but pictures of the original grave may be found in published materials.

== Legacy ==

*Much of Dalton&#x27;s written work, collected by the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, was damaged during bombing on 24 December 1940. It prompted Isaac Asimov to say, &quot;John Dalton&#x27;s records, carefully preserved for a century, were destroyed during the World War II bombing of Manchester. It is not only the living who are killed in war&quot;. The damaged papers are in the John Rylands Library.
*A bust of Dalton, by Chantrey, paid for by public subscription was placed in the entrance hall of the Royal Manchester Institution. Chantrey&#x27;s large statue of Dalton, erected while Dalton was alive was placed in Manchester Town Hall in 1877. He &quot;is probably the only scientist who got a statue in his lifetime&quot;.
* The Manchester-based Swiss phrenologist and sculptor William Bally made a cast of the interior of Dalton&#x27;s cranium and of a cyst therein, having arrived at the Manchester Royal Infirmary too late to make a cast of the head and face. A cast of the head was made, by a Mr Politi, whose arrival at the scene preceded that of Bally.
*John Dalton Street connects Deansgate and Albert Square in the centre of Manchester.
*The John Dalton building at Manchester Metropolitan University is occupied by the Faculty of Science and Engineering. Outside it stands William Theed&#x27;s statue of Dalton, erected in Piccadilly in 1855, and moved there in 1966.
*A blue plaque commemorates the site of his laboratory at 36 George Street in Manchester.
*The University of Manchester established two Dalton Chemical Scholarships, two Dalton Mathematical Scholarships, and a Dalton Prize for Natural History. A hall of residence is named Dalton Hall.
*The Dalton Medal has been awarded only twelve times by the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society.
*The Dalton crater on the Moon was named after Dalton.
*&quot;Daltonism&quot; is a lesser-known synonym of colour-blindness and, in some languages, variations on this have persisted in common usage: for example, &#x27;daltonien&#x27; is the French adjectival equivalent of &#x27;colour-blind&#x27;, and &#x27;daltónico&#x27;/&#x27;daltonica&#x27; is the Spanish and the Italian.
*The inorganic section of the UK&#x27;s Royal Society of Chemistry is named the Dalton Division, and the society&#x27;s academic journal for inorganic chemistry is called Dalton Transactions.
*In honour of Dalton&#x27;s work, many chemists and biochemists use the unit of mass dalton (symbol Da), also known as the unified atomic mass unit, equal to 1/12 the mass of a neutral atom of carbon-12). The dalton is officially accepted for use with the SI.
*Quaker schools have named buildings after Dalton: for example, a schoolhouse in the primary sector of Ackworth School, is called Dalton.
*Dalton Township in southern Ontario was named after him. In 2001 the name was lost when the township was absorbed into the City of Kawartha Lakes but in 2002 the Dalton name was affixed to a new park, Dalton Digby Wildlands Provincial Park.
*Asteroid (12292) Dalton was named after him.

<text>A symphony is an extended musical composition in Western classical music, most often for orchestra. Although the term has had many meanings from its origins in the ancient Greek era, by the late 18th century the word had taken on the meaning common today: a work usually consisting of multiple distinct sections or movements, often four, with the first movement in sonata form. Symphonies are almost always scored for an orchestra consisting of a string section (violin, viola, cello, and double bass), brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments which altogether number about 30 to 100 musicians. Symphonies are notated in a musical score, which contains all the instrument parts. Orchestral musicians play from parts which contain just the notated music for their own instrument. Some symphonies also contain vocal parts (e.g., Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, or Mahler&#x27;s Second Symphony).

==Etymology and origins==
The word &quot;symphony&quot; is derived from the Greek word (), meaning &quot;agreement or concord of sound&quot;, &quot;concert of vocal or instrumental music&quot;, from (), &quot;harmonious&quot;. The word referred to a variety of different concepts before ultimately settling on its current meaning designating a musical form.

In late Greek and medieval theory, the word was used for consonance, as opposed to (), which was the word for &quot;dissonance&quot;. In the Middle Ages and later, the Latin form &quot;symphonia&quot; was used to describe various instruments, especially those capable of producing more than one sound simultaneously. Isidore of Seville was the first to use the word symphonia as the name of a two-headed drum, and from to 1377 the French form &quot;symphonie&quot; was the name of the &quot;organistrum&quot; or hurdy-gurdy. In late medieval England, &quot;symphony&quot; was used in both of these senses, whereas by the 16th century it was equated with the dulcimer. In German, &quot;Symphonie&quot; was a generic term for spinets and virginals from the late 16th century to the 18th century.

In the sense of &quot;sounding together&quot;, the word begins to appear in the titles of some works by 16th- and 17th-century composers including Giovanni Gabrieli&#x27;s &quot;Sacrae symphoniae&quot;, and &quot;Symphoniae sacrae, liber secundus&quot;, published in 1597 and 1615, respectively; Adriano Banchieri&#x27;s &quot;Eclesiastiche sinfonie, dette canzoni in aria francese, per sonare, et cantare&quot;, Op. 16, published in 1607; Lodovico Grossi da Viadana&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonie musicali&quot;, Op. 18, published in 1610; and Heinrich Schütz&#x27;s &quot;Symphoniae sacrae&quot;, Op. 6, and &quot;Symphoniarum sacrarum secunda pars&quot;, Op. 10, published in 1629 and 1647, respectively. Except for Viadana&#x27;s collection, which contained purely instrumental and secular music, these were all collections of sacred vocal works, some with instrumental accompaniment.

==Baroque era==
In the 17th century, for most of the Baroque era, the terms &quot;symphony&quot; and &quot;sinfonia&quot; were used for a range of different compositions, including instrumental pieces used in operas, sonatas and concertos—usually part of a larger work. The &quot;opera sinfonia&quot;, or &quot;Italian overture&quot; had, by the 18th century, a standard structure of three contrasting movements: fast, slow, fast and dance-like. It is this form that is often considered as the direct forerunner of the orchestral symphony. The terms &quot;overture&quot;, &quot;symphony&quot; and &quot;sinfonia&quot; were widely regarded as interchangeable for much of the 18th century.

In the 17th century, pieces scored for large instrumental ensemble did not precisely designate which instruments were to play which parts, as is the practice from the 19th century to the current period. When composers from the 17th century wrote pieces, they expected that these works would be performed by whatever group of musicians were available. To give one example, whereas the bassline in a 19th-century work is scored for cellos, double basses and other specific instruments, in a 17th-century work, a basso continuo part for a sinfonia would not specify which instruments would play the part. A performance of the piece might be done with a basso continuo group as small as a single cello and harpsichord. However, if a bigger budget was available for a performance and a larger sound was required, a basso continuo group might include multiple chord-playing instruments (harpsichord, lute, etc.) and a range of bass instruments, including cello, double bass, bass viol or even a serpent, an early bass wind instrument.

==Galant and classical eras==

LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson write in the second edition of &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; that &quot;the symphony was cultivated with extraordinary intensity&quot; in the 18th century. It played a role in many areas of public life, including church services, but a particularly strong area of support for symphonic performances was the aristocracy. In Vienna, perhaps the most important location in Europe for the composition of symphonies, &quot;literally hundreds of noble families supported musical establishments, generally dividing their time between Vienna and their ancestral estate [elsewhere in the Empire]&quot;. Since the normal size of the orchestra at the time was quite small, many of these courtly establishments were capable of performing symphonies. The young Joseph Haydn, taking up his first job as a music director in 1757 for the Morzin family, found that when the Morzin household was in Vienna, his own orchestra was only part of a lively and competitive musical scene, with multiple aristocrats sponsoring concerts with their own ensembles.

LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson&#x27;s article traces the gradual expansion of the symphonic orchestra through the 18th century. At first, symphonies were string symphonies, written in just four parts: first violin, second violin, viola, and bass (the bass line was taken by cello(s), double bass(es) playing the part an octave below, and perhaps also a bassoon). Occasionally the early symphonists even dispensed with the viola part, thus creating three-part symphonies. A basso continuo part including a bassoon together with a harpsichord or other chording instrument was also possible.

The first additions to this simple ensemble were a pair of horns, occasionally a pair of oboes, and then both horns and oboes together. Over the century, other instruments were added to the classical orchestra: flutes (sometimes replacing the oboes), separate parts for bassoons, clarinets, and trumpets and timpani. Works varied in their scoring concerning which of these additional instruments were to appear. The full-scale classical orchestra, deployed at the end of the century for the largest-scale symphonies, has the standard string ensemble mentioned above, pairs of winds (flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons), a pair of horns, and timpani. A keyboard continuo instrument (harpsichord or piano) remained an option.

The &quot;Italian&quot; style of symphony, often used as overture and entr&#x27;acte in opera houses, became a standard three-movement form: a fast movement, a slow movement, and another fast movement. Over the course of the 18th century it became the custom to write four-movement symphonies, along the lines described in the next paragraph. The three-movement symphony died out slowly; about half of Haydn&#x27;s first thirty symphonies are in three movements; and for the young Mozart, the three-movement symphony was the norm, perhaps under the influence of his friend Johann Christian Bach. An outstanding late example of the three-movement Classical symphony is Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Prague Symphony&quot;, from 1786.

The four-movement form that emerged from this evolution was as follows:

Variations on this layout, like changing the order of the middle movements or adding a slow introduction to the first movement, were common. Haydn, Mozart and their contemporaries restricted their use of the four-movement form to orchestral or multi-instrument chamber music such as quartets, though since Beethoven solo sonatas are as often written in four as in three movements.

The composition of early symphonies was centred on Milan, Vienna, and Mannheim. The Milanese school centred around Giovanni Battista Sammartini and included Antonio Brioschi, Ferdinando Galimberti and Giovanni Battista Lampugnani. Early exponents of the form in Vienna included Georg Christoph Wagenseil, Wenzel Raimund Birck and Georg Matthias Monn, while later significant Viennese composers of symphonies included Johann Baptist Wanhal, Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf and Leopold Hofmann. The Mannheim school included Johann Stamitz.

The most important symphonists of the latter part of the 18th century are Haydn, who wrote at least 106 symphonies over the course of 36 years, and Mozart, with at least 47 symphonies in 24 years.

==Romantic era==
At the beginning of the 19th century, Beethoven elevated the symphony from an everyday genre produced in large quantities to a supreme form in which composers strove to reach the highest potential of music in just a few works. Beethoven began with two works directly emulating his models Mozart and Haydn, then seven more symphonies, starting with the Third Symphony (&quot;Eroica&quot;) that expanded the scope and ambition of the genre. His Symphony No. 5 is perhaps the most famous symphony ever written; its transition from the emotionally stormy C minor opening movement to a triumphant major-key finale provided a model adopted by later symphonists such as Brahms and Mahler. His Symphony No. 6 is a programmatic work, featuring instrumental imitations of bird calls and a storm; and, unconventionally, a fifth movement (symphonies usually had at most four movements). His Symphony No. 9 includes parts for vocal soloists and choir in the last movement, making it a choral symphony.

Of the symphonies by Schubert, two are core repertory items and are frequently performed. Of the Eighth Symphony (1822), Schubert completed only the first two movements; this highly Romantic work is usually called by its nickname &quot;The Unfinished&quot;. His last completed symphony, the Ninth (1826) is a massive work in the Classical idiom.

Of the early Romantics, Felix Mendelssohn (five symphonies, plus thirteen string symphonies) and Robert Schumann (four) continued to write symphonies in the classical mould, though using their own musical language. In contrast, Berlioz favored programmatic works, including his &quot;dramatic symphony&quot; &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;, the viola symphony &quot;Harold en Italie&quot; and the highly original &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;. The latter is also a programme work and has both a march and a waltz and five movements instead of the customary four. His fourth and last symphony, the &quot;Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale&quot; (originally titled &quot;Symphonie militaire&quot;) was composed in 1840 for a 200-piece marching military band, to be performed out of doors, and is an early example of a band symphony. Berlioz later added optional string parts and a choral finale. In 1851, Richard Wagner declared that all of these post-Beethoven symphonies were no more than an epilogue, offering nothing substantially new. Indeed, after Schumann&#x27;s last symphony, the &quot;Rhenish&quot; composed in 1850, for two decades the Lisztian symphonic poem appeared to have displaced the symphony as the leading form of large-scale instrumental music. However, Liszt also composed two programmatic choral symphonies during this time, &quot;Faust&quot; and &quot;Dante&quot;. If the symphony had otherwise been eclipsed, it was not long before it re-emerged in a &quot;second age&quot; in the 1870s and 1880s, with the symphonies by Bruckner, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Saint-Saëns, Borodin, Dvořák, and Franck—works which largely avoided the programmatic elements of Berlioz and Liszt and dominated the concert repertory for at least a century.

Over the course of the 19th century, composers continued to add to the size of the symphonic orchestra. Around the beginning of the century, a full-scale orchestra would consist of the string section plus pairs of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, trumpets, and lastly a set of timpani. This is, for instance, the scoring used in Beethoven&#x27;s symphonies numbered 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8. Trombones, which had previously been confined to church and theater music, came to be added to the symphonic orchestra, notably in Beethoven&#x27;s 5th, 6th, and 9th symphonies. The combination of bass drum, triangle, and cymbals (sometimes also: piccolo), which 18th-century composers employed as a coloristic effect in so-called &quot;Turkish music&quot;, came to be increasingly used during the second half of the 19th century without any such connotations of genre. By the time of Mahler (see below), it was possible for a composer to write a symphony scored for &quot;a veritable compendium of orchestral instruments&quot;. In addition to increasing in variety of instruments, 19th-century symphonies were gradually augmented with more string players and more wind parts, so that the orchestra grew substantially in sheer numbers, as concert halls likewise grew.

==Late-Romantic, modernist and postmodernist eras==
Towards the end of the 19th century, Gustav Mahler began writing long, large-scale symphonies that he continued composing into the early 20th century. His Third Symphony, completed in 1896, is one of the longest regularly performed symphonies at around 100 minutes in length for most performances. The Eighth Symphony was composed in 1906 and is nicknamed the &quot;Symphony of a Thousand&quot; because of the large number of voices required to perform the work.

The 20th century saw further diversification in the style and content of works that composers labeled &quot;symphonies&quot;. Some composers, including Dmitri Shostakovich, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Carl Nielsen, continued to write in the traditional four-movement form, while other composers took different approaches: Jean Sibelius&#x27; Symphony No. 7, his last, is in one movement, Richard Strauss&#x27; Alpine Symphony, in one movement, split into twenty-two parts, detailing an eleven hour hike through the mountains and Alan Hovhaness&#x27;s Symphony No. 9, &quot;Saint Vartan&quot;—originally Op. 80, changed to Op. 180—composed in 1949–50, is in twenty-four.

A concern with unification of the traditional four-movement symphony into a single, subsuming formal conception had emerged in the late 19th century. This has been called a &quot;two-dimensional symphonic form&quot;, and finds its key turning point in Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s Chamber Symphony No. 1, Op. 9 (1909), which was followed in the 1920s by other notable single-movement German symphonies, including Kurt Weill&#x27;s First Symphony (1921), Max Butting&#x27;s Chamber Symphony, Op. 25 (1923), and Paul Dessau&#x27;s 1926 Symphony.

Alongside this experimentation, other 20th-century symphonies deliberately attempted to evoke the 18th-century origins of the genre, in terms of form and even musical style, with prominent examples being Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 &quot;Classical&quot; of 1916–17 and the Symphony in C by Igor Stravinsky of 1938–40.

There remained, however, certain tendencies. Designating a work a &quot;symphony&quot; still implied a degree of sophistication and seriousness of purpose. The word &quot;sinfonietta&quot; came into use to designate a work that is shorter, of more modest aims, or &quot;lighter&quot; than a symphony, such as Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s Sinfonietta for orchestra.

In addition to those composers listed above, other symphonists from the first half of the twentieth century include Edward Elgar, Bohuslav Martinů, Roger Sessions, William Walton, and Rued Langgaard. The symphonies of this period were &quot;extraordinary in scope, richness, originality, and urgency of expression&quot;. One measure of a symphony&#x27;s significance is how much it reflects particular to its age. Twentieth-century composers who fulfil this measure include Jean Sibelius, Igor Stravinsky, Luciano Berio (in his Sinfonia, 1968–69), Elliott Carter (in his &quot;Symphony of Three Orchestras&quot;, 1976), and Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen (in &quot;Symphony/Antiphony&quot;, 1980).

From the mid-20th century into the 21st there has been a resurgence of interest in the symphony with many postmodernist composers adding substantially to the canon, not least in the United Kingdom: Peter Maxwell Davies (10), Robin Holloway (1), David Matthews (9), James MacMillan (5), Peter Seabourne (6), and Philip Sawyers (6). British composer Derek Bourgeois has surpassed the number of symphonies written by Haydn, with 116 symphonies. The greatest number of symphonies to date has been composed by the Finn Leif Segerstam, whose list of works includes 371 symphonies.

==Symphonies for concert band==
Hector Berlioz originally wrote the &quot;Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale&quot; for military band in 1840. Anton Reicha had composed his four-movement &#x27;Commemoration&#x27; Symphony (also known as &quot;Musique pour célébrer le Mémorie des Grands Hommes qui se sont Illustrés au Service de la Nation Française&quot;) for large wind ensemble even earlier, in 1815, for ceremonies associated with the reburial of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette

After those early efforts, few symphonies were written for wind bands until the 20th century when more symphonies were written for concert band than in past centuries. Although examples exist from as early as 1932, the first such symphony of importance is Nikolai Myaskovsky&#x27;s Symphony No. 19, Op. 46, composed in 1939. Some further examples are Paul Hindemith&#x27;s Symphony in B-flat for Band, composed in 1951; Morton Gould&#x27;s Symphony No. 4 &quot;West Point&quot;, composed in 1952; Vincent Persichetti&#x27;s Symphony No. 6, Op. 69, composed in 1956; Vittorio Giannini&#x27;s Symphony No. 3, composed in 1958; Alan Hovhaness&#x27;s Symphonies No. 4, Op. 165, No. 7, &quot;Nanga Parvat&quot;, Op. 175, No. 14, &quot;Ararat&quot;, Op. 194, and No. 23, &quot;Ani&quot;, Op. 249, composed in 1958, 1959, 1961, and 1972 respectively; John Barnes Chance&#x27;s Symphony No. 2, composed in 1972; Alfred Reed&#x27;s 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th symphonies, composed in 1979, 1988, 1992, and 1994 respectively; eight of the ten numbered symphonies of David Maslanka; six symphonies to date by Julie Giroux (although she is currently working on a seventh); Johan de Meij&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, composed in 1988, and his Symphony No. 2 &quot;The Big Apple&quot;, composed in 1993; Yasuhide Ito&#x27;s Symphony in Three Scenes &#x27;La Vita&#x27;, composed in 1998, which is his third symphony for wind band; John Corigliano&#x27;s Symphony No. 3 &#x27;Circus Maximus, composed in 2004; Denis Levaillant&#x27;s PachaMama Symphony, composed in 2014 and 2015, and James M. Stephenson&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 which was premiered by the United States Marine Band (&quot;The President&#x27;s Own&quot;) and received both the National Band Association&#x27;s William D. Revelli (2017) and the American Bandmasters Association&#x27;s Sousa/Ostwald (2018) awards.

==Other modern usages of &quot;symphony&quot;==
In some forms of English, the word &quot;symphony&quot; is also used to refer to the orchestra, the large ensemble that often performs these works. The word &quot;symphony&quot; appears in the name of many orchestras, for example, the London Symphony Orchestra, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the St. Louis Symphony, the Houston Symphony, or Miami&#x27;s New World Symphony. For some orchestras, &quot;(city name) Symphony&quot; provides a shorter version of the full name; for instance, the OED gives &quot;Vancouver Symphony&quot; as a possible abbreviated form of Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. Additionally, in common usage, a person may say they are going out to hear a symphony perform, a reference to the orchestra and not the works on the program. These usages are not common in British English.

<text>A concerto (; plural &quot;concertos&quot;, or &quot;concerti&quot; from the Italian plural) is, from the late Baroque era, mostly understood as an instrumental composition, written for one or more soloists accompanied by an orchestra or other ensemble. The typical three-movement structure, a slow movement (e.g., lento or adagio) preceded and followed by fast movements (e.g., presto or allegro), became a standard from the early 18th century.

The concerto originated as a genre of vocal music in the late 16th century: the instrumental variant appeared around a century later, when Italians such as Giuseppe Torelli and Arcangelo Corelli started to publish their concertos. A few decades later, Venetian composers, such as Antonio Vivaldi, had written hundreds of violin concertos, while also producing solo concertos for other instruments such as a cello or a woodwind instrument, and concerti grossi for a group of soloists. The first keyboard concertos, such as George Frideric Handel&#x27;s organ concertos and Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s harpsichord concertos, were written around the same time.

In the second half of the 18th century, the piano became the most used keyboard instrument, and composers of the Classical Era such as Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven each wrote several piano concertos, and, to a lesser extent, violin concertos, and concertos for other instruments. In the Romantic Era, many composers, including Niccolò Paganini, Felix Mendelssohn, Frédéric Chopin, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and Sergei Rachmaninoff, continued to write solo concertos, and, more exceptionally, concertos for more than one instrument; 19th century concertos for instruments other than the piano, violin and cello remained comparatively rare however. In the first half of the 20th century, concertos were written by, among others, Maurice Ravel, Edward Elgar, Richard Strauss, Sergei Prokofiev, George Gershwin, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Joaquín Rodrigo and Béla Bartók, the latter also composing a concerto for orchestra, that is without soloist. During the 20th century concertos appeared by major composers for orchestral instruments which had been neglected in the 19th century such as the clarinet, viola and French horn.

In the second half of the 20th century and onwards into the 21st a great many composers have continued to write concertos, including Alfred Schnittke, György Ligeti, Dimitri Shostakovich, Philip Glass and James MacMillan among many others. An interesting feature of this period is the proliferation of concerti for less usual instruments, including orchestral ones such as the double bass (by composers like Eduard Tubin or Peter Maxwell Davies) and cor anglais (like those by MacMillan and Aaron Jay Kernis), but also folk instruments (such as Tubin&#x27;s concerto for Balalaika, Serry&#x27;s &quot;Concerto in C Major for Bassetti Accordion&quot;, or the concertos for Harmonica by Villa-Lobos and Malcolm Arnold), and even Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra&quot;, a concerto for a rock band.

Concertos from previous ages have remained a conspicuous part of the repertoire for concert performances and recordings. Less common has been the previously common practice of the composition of concertos by a performer to be performed personally, though the practice has continued via certain composer-performers such as Daniil Trifonov.

==Genre==
The Italian word &quot;concerto&quot;, meaning accord or gathering, derives from the Latin verb &quot;concertare&quot;, which indicates a competition or battle.

===Baroque Era===

Compositions were for the first time indicated as concertos in the title of a music print when the were published in 1587.

====Concerto as a genre of vocal music====

In the 17th century, sacred works for voices and orchestra were typically called concertos, as reflected by J. S. Bach&#x27;s usage of the title &quot;concerto&quot; for many of the works that we know as cantatas. The term &quot;concerto&quot; was initially used to denote works that involved voices and instruments in which the instruments had independent parts—as opposed to the Renaissance common practice in which instruments that accompanied voices only doubled the voice parts. Examples of this earlier form of concerto include Giovanni Gabrieli&#x27;s &quot;In Ecclesiis&quot; or Heinrich Schütz&#x27;s &quot;Saul, Saul, was verfolgst du mich&quot;.

====Instrumental concerto====

The concerto began to take its modern shape in the late-Baroque period, beginning with the &quot;concerto grosso&quot; form developed by Arcangelo Corelli. Corelli&#x27;s concertino group was two violins, a cello and basso continuo. In J. S. Bach&#x27;s Fifth Brandenburg Concerto, for example, the concertino is a flute, a violin, and a harpsichord; although the harpsichord is a featured solo instrument, it also sometimes plays with the &quot;ripieno&quot;, functioning as a continuo keyboard accompaniment.

Later, the concerto approached its modern form, in which the concertino usually reduces to a single solo instrument playing with (or against) an orchestra. The main composers of concertos of the baroque were Tommaso Albinoni, Antonio Vivaldi (e.g., published in &quot;L&#x27;estro armonico&quot;, &quot;La stravaganza&quot;, Six Violin Concertos, Op. 6, Twelve Concertos, Op. 7, &quot;Il cimento dell&#x27;armonia e dell&#x27;inventione&quot;, Six Flute Concertos, Op. 10, Six Concertos, Op. 11 and Six Violin Concertos, Op. 12), Georg Philipp Telemann, Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, Pietro Locatelli, Jean-Marie Leclair, Giuseppe Tartini, Francesco Geminiani and Johann Joachim Quantz.
The concerto was intended as a composition typical of the Italian style of the time, and all the composers were studying how to compose in the Italian fashion (&quot;all&#x27;Italiana&quot;).

The Baroque concerto was mainly for a string instrument (violin, viola, cello, seldom viola d&#x27;amore or harp) or a wind instrument (flute, recorder, oboe, bassoon, horn, or trumpet,). Bach also wrote a concerto for two violins and orchestra. During the Baroque period, before the invention of the piano, keyboard concertos were comparatively rare, with the exception of the organ and some harpsichord concertos by Johann Sebastian Bach.

===Classical era===


The concertos of the sons of Johann Sebastian Bach, such as C. P. E. Bach, are perhaps the best links between those of the Baroque period and those of the Classical era. It is conventional to state that the first movements of concertos from the Classical period onwards follow the structure of sonata form. Final movements are often in rondo form, as in J.S. Bach&#x27;s E Major Violin Concerto.

Mozart wrote five violin concertos, all in 1775. They show a number of influences, notably Italian and Austrian. Several passages have leanings towards folk music, as manifested in Austrian serenades. Mozart also wrote the Sinfonia Concertante for violin, viola, and orchestra. Beethoven wrote only one violin concerto that remained obscure until revealed as a masterpiece in a performance by violin virtuoso Joseph Joachim on 27 May 1844.

C.P.E. Bach&#x27;s keyboard concertos contain some virtuosic solo writing. Some of them have movements that run into one another without a break, and there are frequent cross-movement thematic references. Mozart, as a child, made arrangements for keyboard and orchestra of four sonatas by now little-known composers. Then he arranged three sonata movements by Johann Christian Bach. By the time he was twenty, Mozart was able to write concerto ritornelli that gave the orchestra admirable opportunity for asserting its character in an exposition with some five or six sharply contrasted themes, before the soloist enters to elaborate on the material. Of his 27 piano concertos, the last 22 are highly appreciated. A dozen cataloged keyboard concertos are attributed to Haydn, of which only three or four are considered genuine.

C. P. E. Bach wrote five flute concertos and two oboe concertos. Mozart wrote five horn concertos, with two for flute, oboe (later rearranged for flute and known as Flute Concerto No. 2), clarinet, and bassoon, four for horn, a Concerto for Flute, Harp, and Orchestra, and &quot;Exsultate, jubilate&quot;, a &quot;de facto&quot; concerto for soprano voice. They all exploit and explore the characteristics of the solo instrument(s). Haydn wrote an important trumpet concerto and a &quot;Sinfonia Concertante&quot; for violin, cello, oboe and bassoon as well as two horn concertos. Haydn also wrote a concerto for double bass but has since been lost to history in the great fire of Esterhaza in 1779.

===Romantic era===
In the 19th century, the concerto as a vehicle for virtuosic display flourished, and concertos became increasingly complex and ambitious works. Whilst performances of typical concertos in the baroque era lasted about ten minutes, those by Beethoven could last half an hour or longer. The term concertino (composition), or the German &quot;Konzertstuck&quot; (&quot;Concert Piece&quot;) began to be used to designate smaller pieces not considered large enough to be considered a full concerto, though the distinction has never been formalised and many Concertinos are still longer than the original Baroque concertos.

During the Romantic era the cello became increasingly used as a concerto instrument; though the violin and piano remained the most frequently used. Beethoven contributed to the repertoire of concertos for more than one soloist with a &quot; Triple Concerto&quot; for piano, violin, cello and orchestra while later in the century, Brahms wrote a &quot; Double Concerto&quot; for violin, cello and orchestra.

===20th and 21st century===

Many of the concertos written in the early 20th century belong more to the late Romantic school, hence modernistic movement. Masterpieces were written by Edward Elgar (a violin concerto and a cello concerto), Sergei Rachmaninoff and Nikolai Medtner (four and three piano concertos, respectively), Jean Sibelius (a violin concerto), Frederick Delius (a violin concerto, a cello concerto, a piano concerto and a double concerto for violin and cello), Karol Szymanowski (two violin concertos and a &quot;Symphonie Concertante&quot; for piano), and Richard Strauss (two horn concertos, a violin concerto, &quot;Don Quixote&quot;—a tone poem that features the cello as a soloist—and among later works, an oboe concerto).

However, in the first decades of the 20th century, several composers such as Debussy, Schoenberg, Berg, Hindemith, Stravinsky, Prokofiev and Bartók started experimenting with ideas that were to have far-reaching consequences for the way music is written and, in some cases, performed. Some of these innovations include a more frequent use of modality, the exploration of non-western scales, the development of atonality and neotonality, the wider acceptance of dissonances, the invention of the twelve-tone technique of composition and the use of polyrhythms and complex time signatures.

These changes also affected the concerto as a musical form. Beside more or less radical effects on musical language, they led to a redefinition of the concept of virtuosity that included new and extended instrumental techniques and a focus on previously neglected aspects of sound such as pitch, timbre and dynamics. In some cases, they also brought about a new approach to the role of soloists and their relation to the orchestra.

Two great innovators of early 20th-century music, Schoenberg and Stravinsky, both wrote violin concertos. The material in Schoenberg&#x27;s concerto, like that in Berg&#x27;s, is linked by the twelve-tone serial method. In the 20th century, particularly after the Second World War, the cello enjoyed an unprecedented popularity. As a result, its concertante repertoire caught up with those of the piano and the violin both in terms of quantity and quality.

The 20th century also witnessed a growth of the concertante repertoire of instruments, some of which had seldom or never been used in this capacity, and even a concerto for wordless coloratura soprano by Reinhold Glière. As a result, almost all classical instruments now have a concertante repertoire. Among the works of the prolific composer Alan Hovhaness may be noted &quot;Prayer of St. Gregory&quot; for trumpet and strings, though it is not a concerto in the usual sense of the term. In the later 20th century the concerto tradition was continued by composers such as Maxwell Davies, whose series of Strathclyde Concertos exploit some of the instruments less familiar as soloists.

In addition, the 20th century gave rise to several composers who experimented further by showcasing a variety of nontraditional orchestral instruments within the center of the orthodox concerto form. Included within this group are:
Paul Hindemith (&quot;Concerto for Trautonium and String Orchestra&quot; in 1931), Andre Jolivet (&quot;Concerto of Ondes Martenot&quot; in 1947), Heitor Villa-Lobos (&quot;Concerto for Harmonica&quot; in 1956), John Serry Sr. (&quot;Concerto in C Major for Bassetti Accordion&quot; in 1966), Astor Piazzolla (&quot;Concerto for Bandoneon, String Orchestra and Percussion&quot;, &quot;Aconcagua&quot; in 1979), Peter Maxwell Davies (&quot;Concerto for Piccolo and Orchestra,&quot; Op. 182 in 1996), and Tan Dun (&quot;Concerto for Water Percussion and Orchestra&quot; in 1998)

Other composers of this era adopted a neoclassical rejection of specific features which typically characterized the concerto form during the Baroque or Romantic periods. Several of them achieved this objective by incorporating various musical elements from the realm of jazz within the structure of the concerto. Included in this group were: Aaron Copland (&quot;Concerto for Piano&quot;, 1926), Maurice Ravel (&quot;Concerto for the Left Hand&quot;, 1929), Igor Stravinsky (&quot;Ebony Concerto&quot; for clarinet and jazz band, 1945) and George Gershwin (&quot;Concerto in F&quot;, 1925). Still others called upon the orchestra itself to function as the primary virtuosic force within the concerto form. This approach was adopted by Bela Bartok in his &quot;Concerto for Orchestra&quot; as well by other composers of the period including: Walter Piston (1933), Zoltan Kodaly (1939), Michael Tippet (1962) and Elliott Carter (1969).

Early Romantic traits can be found in the violin concertos of Viotti, but it is Spohr&#x27;s twelve violin concertos, written between 1802 and 1827, that truly embrace the Romantic spirit with their melodic as well as their dramatic qualities.

20th century:
* Arnold Schoenberg

* Bartók wrote two concertos for violin.
* Russian composers Prokofiev and Shostakovich each wrote two concertos while Khachaturian wrote a concerto and a Concerto-Rhapsody for the instrument.
* Hindemith&#x27;s concertos hark back to the forms of the 19th century, even if the harmonic language he used was different.
* Three violin concertos from David Diamond show the form in neoclassical style.
* In 1950 Carlos Chávez completed a substantial Violin Concerto with an enormous central cadenza for the unaccompanied violin.
* Dutilleux&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Arbre des songes&quot; has proved an important addition to the repertoire and a fine example of the composer&#x27;s atonal yet melodic style.
* Other composers of major violin concertos include John Adams, Samuel Barber, Benjamin Britten, Peter Maxwell Davies, Miguel del Aguila, Philip Glass, Cristóbal Halffter, György Ligeti, Frank Martin, Bohuslav Martinů, Carl Nielsen, Walter Piston, Alfred Schnittke, Jean Sibelius, Ralph Vaughan Williams, William Walton, John Williams and Roger Sessions.

=====Cello concerto=====
The &#x27;core&#x27; repertoire—performed the most of any cello concertos—are by Elgar, Dvořák, Saint-Saëns, Haydn, Shostakovich and Schumann, but many more concertos are performed nearly as often.

Baroque era:
* Vivaldi&#x27;s cello concertos RV 398–403, 405–414 and 416–424

Classical era:
* Haydn wrote two cello concertos (for cello, oboes, horns, and strings), which are the most important works in that genre of the classical era. 
* Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach wrote three cello concertos and Luigi Boccherini wrote twelve cello concertos.

Romantic era:
* Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s cello concerto ranks among the supreme examples from the Romantic era while Robert Schumann&#x27;s focuses on the lyrical qualities of the instrument.
* The instrument was also popular with composers of the Franco-Belgian tradition: Saint-Saëns and Vieuxtemps wrote two cello concertos each and Lalo and Jongen one.
* Tchaikovsky&#x27;s contribution to the genre is a series of Variations on a Rococo Theme. He also left very fragmentary sketches of a projected Cello Concerto. Cellist Yuriy Leonovich and Tchaikovsky researcher Brett Langston published their completion of the piece in 2006.
* Carl Reinecke, David Popper and Julius Klengel also wrote cello concertos that were popular in their time and are still played occasionally nowadays.
* Elgar&#x27;s popular concerto, while written in the early 20th century, belongs to the late romantic period stylistically.

20th century:
* An important factor for the 20th-century cello concerto was the rise of virtuoso cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. His outstanding technique and passionate playing prompted dozens of composers to write pieces for him, first in his native Soviet Union and then abroad. Among such compositions may be listed Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s Symphony-Concerto, Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s two cello concertos, Benjamin Britten&#x27;s Cello-Symphony (which emphasizes, as its title suggests, the equal importance of soloist and orchestra), Henri Dutilleux&#x27; &quot;Tout un monde lointain...&quot;, Cristóbal Halffter&#x27;s two cello concertos, Witold Lutosławski&#x27;s cello concerto, Dmitry Kabalevsky&#x27;s two cello concertos, Aram Khachaturian&#x27;s &quot;Concerto-Rhapsody&quot;, Arvo Pärt&#x27;s &quot;Pro et Contra&quot;, Alfred Schnittke, André Jolivet and Krzysztof Penderecki second cello concertos, Sofia Gubaidulina&#x27;s &quot;Canticles of the Sun&quot;, Luciano Berio&#x27;s &quot;Ritorno degli Snovidenia&quot;, Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Three Meditations&quot;, James MacMillan&#x27;s cello concerto and Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Concert à quatre&quot; (a quadruple concerto for cello, piano, oboe, flute and orchestra).
* In addition, several important composers who were not directly influenced by Rostropovich wrote cello concertos: Samuel Barber, Elliott Carter, Carlos Chávez, Miguel del Aguila, Alexander Glazunov, Hans Werner Henze, Paul Hindemith, Arthur Honegger, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, György Ligeti, Bohuslav Martinů, Darius Milhaud, Nikolai Myaskovsky, Einojuhani Rautavaara, Joaquín Rodrigo, Toru Takemitsu, William Walton, Heitor Villa-Lobos, and Bernd Alois Zimmermann for instance.

=====Horn concerto=====

Classical era:
* Bohemian composer Francesco Antonio Rosetti composed several solo and double horn concertos. He was a significant contributor to the genre of horn concertos in the 18th century. Most of his outstanding horn concertos were composed between 1782 and 1789 for the Bohemian duo Franz Zwierzina and Joseph Nage while at the Bavarian court of Oettingen-Wallerstein. One of his best-known works in this genre is his Horn Concerto in E flat major C49/K III:36. It consists of three movements: 1. Allegro moderato 2. Romance 3. Rondo. Many common features of the galant style are present in Rosetti&#x27;s music and composing style. In his E-flat horn concerto, we hear periodic and short phrases, galant harmonic rhythm and melodic line reduction. Rosetti&#x27;s influence on the 18th century composers, musicians and music was considerable. At the Bavarian court of Oettingen-Wallerstein, his music was often performed by the Wallerstein ensembles. In Paris, his compositions were performed by the best ensembles of the city, including the orchestra of the Concert Spirituel. His publishers were Le Menu et Boyer and Sieber. According to H. C. Robbins Landon (Mozart scholar), Rosetti&#x27;s horn concertos might have been a model for Mozart&#x27;s horn concertos.

Romantic era:
* Beethoven&#x27;s five piano concertos increase the technical demands made on the soloist. The last two are particularly remarkable, integrating the concerto into a large symphonic structure with movements that frequently run into one another. His Piano Concerto No. 4 starts with a statement by the piano, after which the orchestra enters in a foreign key, to present what would normally be the opening tutti. The work has a lyrical character. The slow movement is a dramatic dialogue between the soloist and the orchestra. His Piano Concerto No. 5 has the basic rhythm of a Viennese military march. There is no lyrical second subject, but in its place a continuous development of the opening material.
* The piano concertos of Cramer, Field, Düssek, Woelfl, Ries, and Hummel provide a link from the Classical concerto to the Romantic concerto.
* Chopin wrote two piano concertos in which the orchestra is relegated to an accompanying role. Schumann, despite being a pianist-composer, wrote a piano concerto in which virtuosity is never allowed to eclipse the essential lyrical quality of the work. The gentle, expressive melody heard at the beginning on woodwind and horns (after the piano&#x27;s heralding introductory chords) bears the material for most of the argument in the first movement. In fact, argument in the traditional developmental sense is replaced by a kind of variation technique in which soloist and orchestra interweave their ideas.
* Liszt&#x27;s mastery of piano technique matched that of Paganini for the violin. His concertos No. 1 and No. 2 left a deep impression on the style of piano concerto writing, influencing Rubinstein, and especially Tchaikovsky, whose First Piano Concerto&#x27;s rich chordal opening is justly famous.
* Grieg&#x27;s concerto likewise begins in a striking manner after which it continues in a lyrical vein.
* Saint-Saëns wrote five piano concertos and orchestra between 1858 and 1896, in a classical vein.
* Brahms&#x27;s First Piano Concerto in D minor (pub 1861) was the result of an immense amount of work on a mass of material originally intended for a symphony. His Second Piano Concerto in B major (1881) has four movements and is written on a larger scale than any earlier concerto. Like his violin concerto, it is symphonic in proportions.
* Fewer piano concertos were written in the late Romantic Period. But Sergei Rachmaninoff wrote four piano concertos between 1891 and 1926. His Second and Third, being the most popular of the four, went on to become among the most famous in the piano repertoire.
* Other romantic piano concertos, like those by Kalkbrenner, Henri Herz, Moscheles and Thalberg were also very popular in the Romantic era, but not today.

20th century:
* Maurice Ravel wrote two pianos concertos, one in G-major (1931) and the second for the left hand in D-major (date of creation1932).
* Igor Stravinsky wrote three works for solo piano and orchestra:
** Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments
** Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra
** Movements for Piano and Orchestra
* Sergei Prokofiev, another Russian composer, wrote five piano concertos, which he himself performed.
* Dmitri Shostakovich composed two piano concertos. 
* Aram Khachaturian contributed to the repertoire with a piano concerto and a Concerto-Rhapsody.
* Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s Piano Concerto is a well-known example of a dodecaphonic piano concerto.
* Béla Bartók also wrote three piano concertos. Like their violin counterparts, they show the various stages in his musical development. Bartok&#x27;s also rearranged his chamber piece, Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion, into a &quot;Concerto for Two Pianos and Percussion&quot;, adding orchestral accompaniment.
* Cristóbal Halffter wrote a prize-winning neoclassical Piano Concerto in 1953, and a second Piano Concerto in 1987–88.
* Ralph Vaughan Williams wrote a concerto for piano, though it was later reworked as a concerto for two pianos and orchestra—both versions have been recorded
* Benjamin Britten&#x27;s concerto for piano (1938) is a prominent work from his early period.
* Piano concertos by Latin-American composers include one by Carlos Chávez, two by Alberto Ginastera, and five by Heitor Villa-Lobos.
* György Ligeti&#x27;s concerto (1988) has a synthetic quality: it mixes complex rhythms, the composer&#x27;s Hungarian roots and his experiments with micropolyphony from the 1960s and 1970s.
* Witold Lutosławski&#x27;s piano concerto, completed in the same year, alternates between playfulness and mystery. It also displays a partial return to melody after the composer&#x27;s aleatoric period.
* Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin has written six piano concertos.
* Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara wrote three piano concertos, the third one dedicated to Vladimir Ashkenazy, who played and conducted the world première.
* French composer Germaine Tailleferre and Czech composers Bohuslav Martinů and Vítězslava Kaprálová wrote piano concertos.

===For multiple instruments and orchestra===

In the Baroque era, two violins and one cello formed the standard concertino of a concerto grosso.

<text>In music, a sonata (; pl. &quot;sonate&quot;) literally means a piece &quot;played&quot; as opposed to a cantata (Latin and Italian &quot;cantare&quot;, &quot;to sing&quot;), a piece &quot;sung&quot;. The term evolved through the history of music, designating a variety of forms until the Classical era, when it took on increasing importance. Sonata is a vague term, with varying meanings depending on the context and time period. By the early 19th century, it came to represent a principle of composing large-scale works. It was applied to most instrumental genres and regarded—alongside the fugue—as one of two fundamental methods of organizing, interpreting and analyzing concert music. Though the musical style of sonatas has changed since the Classical era, most 20th- and 21st-century sonatas still maintain the same structure.

The term sonatina, pl. &quot;sonatine&quot;, the diminutive form of sonata, is often used for a short or technically easy sonata.

==Instrumentation==
In the Baroque period, a sonata was for one or more instruments, almost always with continuo. After the Baroque period most works designated as sonatas specifically are performed by a solo instrument, most often a keyboard instrument, or by a solo instrument accompanied by a keyboard instrument.

Sonatas for a solo instrument other than keyboard have been composed, as have sonatas for other combinations of instruments.

==History==

=== Baroque ===

In the works of Arcangelo Corelli and his contemporaries, two broad classes of sonata were established, and were first described by Sébastien de Brossard in his &quot;Dictionaire de musique&quot; (third edition, Amsterdam, ca. 1710): the sonata da chiesa (that is, suitable for use in church), which was the type &quot;rightly known as &quot;Sonatas&quot;&quot;, and the sonata da camera (proper for use at court), which consists of a prelude followed by a succession of dances, all in the same key. Although the four, five, or six movements of the sonata da chiesa are also most often in one key, one or two of the internal movements are sometimes in a contrasting tonality.

The sonata da chiesa, generally for one or two violins and basso continuo, consisted normally of a slow introduction, a loosely fugued allegro, a slow movement, and a lively finale in some binary form suggesting affinity with the dance-tunes of the suite. This scheme, however, was not very clearly defined, until the works of Arcangelo Corelli when it became the essential sonata and persisted as a tradition of Italian violin music.

The sonata da camera consisted almost entirely of idealized dance-tunes. On the other hand, the features of &quot;sonata da chiesa&quot; and &quot;sonata da camera&quot; then tended to be freely intermixed. Although nearly half of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s 1,100 surviving compositions, arrangements, and transcriptions are instrumental works, only about 4% are sonatas.

The term &quot;sonata&quot; is also applied to the series of over 500 works for harpsichord solo, or sometimes for other keyboard instruments, by Domenico Scarlatti, originally published under the name &quot;Essercizi per il gravicembalo&quot; (Exercises for the Harpsichord). Most of these pieces are in one binary-form movement only, with two parts that are in the same tempo and use the same thematic material, though occasionally there will be changes in tempo within the sections. They are frequently virtuosic, and use more distant harmonic transitions and modulations than were common for other works of the time. They were admired for their great variety and invention.

Both the solo and trio sonatas of Vivaldi show parallels with the concerti he was writing at the same time. He composed over 70 sonatas, the great majority of which are of the solo type; most of the rest are trio sonatas, and a very small number are of the multivoice type.

The sonatas of Domenico Paradies are mild and elongated works with a graceful and melodious little second movement included.

===Classical period===
The practice of the Classical period would become decisive for the sonata; the term moved from being one of many terms indicating genres or forms, to designating the fundamental form of organization for large-scale works. This evolution stretched over fifty years. The term came to apply both to the structure of individual movements (see Sonata form and History of sonata form) and to the layout of the movements in a multi-movement work. In the transition to the Classical period there were several names given to multimovement works, including divertimento, serenade, and partita, many of which are now regarded effectively as sonatas. The usage of &quot;sonata&quot; as the standard term for such works began somewhere in the 1770s. Haydn labels his first piano sonata as such in 1771, after which the term &quot;divertimento&quot; is used sparingly in his output. The term &quot;sonata&quot; was increasingly applied to either a work for keyboard alone (see piano sonata), or for keyboard and one other instrument, often the violin or cello. It was less and less frequently applied to works with more than two instrumentalists; for example, piano trios were not often labelled &quot;sonata for piano, violin, and cello.&quot;

Initially the most common layout of movements was:

# Allegro, which at the time was understood to mean not only a tempo, but also some degree of &quot;working out&quot;, or development, of the theme.
# A middle movement, most frequently a slow movement: an Andante, an Adagio or a Largo; or less frequently a Minuet or Theme and Variations form.
# A closing movement was generally an Allegro or a Presto, often labeled &quot;Finale&quot;. The form was often a Rondo or Minuet.

However, two-movement layouts also occur, a practice Haydn uses as late as the 1790s. There was also in the early Classical period the possibility of using four movements, with a dance movement inserted before the slow movement, as in Haydn&#x27;s Piano sonatas No. 6 and No. 8. Mozart&#x27;s sonatas were also primarily in three movements. Of the works that Haydn labelled &quot;piano sonata&quot;, &quot;divertimento&quot;, or &quot;partita&quot; in Hob XIV, seven are in two movements, thirty-five are in three, and three are in four; and there are several in three or four movements whose authenticity is listed as &quot;doubtful.&quot; Composers such as Boccherini would publish sonatas for piano and obbligato instrument with an optional third movement—–in Boccherini&#x27;s case, 28 cello sonatas.

But increasingly instrumental works were laid out in four, not three movements, a practice seen first in string quartets and symphonies, and reaching the sonata proper in the early sonatas of Beethoven. However, two- and three-movement sonatas continued to be written throughout the Classical period: Beethoven&#x27;s opus 102 pair has a two-movement C major sonata and a three-movement D major sonata. Nevertheless, works with fewer or more than four movements were increasingly felt to be exceptions; they were labelled as having movements &quot;omitted,&quot; or as having &quot;extra&quot; movements.

Thus, the four-movement layout was by this point standard for the string quartet, and overwhelmingly the most common for the symphony. The usual order of the four movements was:

# An allegro, which by this point was in what is called sonata form, complete with exposition, development, and recapitulation.
# A slow movement, an Andante, an Adagio or a Largo.
# A dance movement, frequently Minuet and trio or—especially later in the classical period—a Scherzo and trio.
# A finale in faster tempo, often in a sonata–rondo form.

When movements appeared out of this order they would be described as &quot;reversed&quot;, such as the scherzo coming before the slow movement in Beethoven&#x27;s 9th Symphony. This usage would be noted by critics in the early 19th century, and it was codified into teaching soon thereafter.

It is difficult to overstate the importance of Beethoven&#x27;s output of sonatas: 32 piano sonatas, plus sonatas for cello and piano or violin and piano, forming a large body of music that would over time increasingly be thought essential for any serious instrumentalist to master.

===Romantic period===
In the early 19th century, the current usage of the term &quot;sonata&quot; was established, both as regards form &quot;per se&quot;, and in the sense that a fully elaborated sonata serves as a norm for concert music in general, which other forms are seen in relation to. From this point forward, the word &quot;sonata&quot; in music theory labels as much the abstract musical form as particular works. Hence there are references to a symphony as a &quot;sonata for orchestra&quot;. This is referred to by William Newman as the &quot;sonata idea&quot;.

Among works expressly labeled &quot;sonata&quot; for the piano, there are the three of Frédéric Chopin, those of Felix Mendelssohn, the three of Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt&#x27;s Sonata in B minor, and later the sonatas of Johannes Brahms and Sergei Rachmaninoff.

In the early 19th century, the sonata form was defined, from a combination of previous practice and the works of important Classical composers, particularly Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, but composers such as Clementi also. It is during this period that the differences between the three- and the four-movement layouts became a subject of commentary, with emphasis on the concerto being laid out in three movements, and the symphony in four.

Ernest Newman wrote in the essay &quot;Brahms and the Serpent&quot;:

:That, perhaps, will be the ideal of the instrumental music of the future; the way to it, indeed, seems at last to be opening out before modern composers in proportion as they discard the last tiresome vestiges of sonata form. This, from being what it was originally, the natural mode of expression of a certain eighteenth century way of thinking in music, became in the nineteenth century a drag upon both individual thinking and the free unfolding of the inner vital force of an idea, and is now simply a shop device by which a bad composer may persuade himself and the innocent reader of textbooks that he is a good one.

===After the Romantic period===
The role of the sonata as an extremely important form of extended musical argument would inspire composers such as Hindemith, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Tailleferre, Ustvolskaya, and Williams to compose in sonata form, and works with traditional sonata structures continue to be composed and performed.

==Scholarship and musicology==

=== Sonata idea or principle ===
Research into the practice and meaning of sonata form, style, and structure has been the motivation for important theoretical works by Heinrich Schenker, Arnold Schoenberg, and Charles Rosen among others; and the pedagogy of music continued to rest on an understanding and application of the rules of sonata form as almost two centuries of development in practice and theory had codified it.

The development of the classical style and its norms of composition formed the basis for much of the music theory of the 19th and 20th centuries. As an overarching formal principle, sonata was accorded the same central status as Baroque fugue; generations of composers, instrumentalists, and audiences were guided by this understanding of sonata as an enduring and dominant principle in Western music. The sonata idea begins before the term had taken on its present importance, along with the evolution of the Classical period&#x27;s changing norms. The reasons for these changes, and how they relate to the evolving sense of a new formal order in music, is a matter to which research is devoted. Some common factors which were pointed to include: the shift of focus from vocal music to instrumental music; changes in performance practice, including the loss of the continuo.

Crucial to most interpretations of the sonata form is the idea of a tonal center; and, as the &quot;Grove Concise Dictionary of Music&quot; puts it: &quot;The main form of the group embodying the &#x27;sonata principle&#x27;, the most important principle of musical structure from the Classical period to the 20th century: that material first stated in a complementary key be restated in the home key&quot;.(

The sonata idea has been thoroughly explored by William Newman in his monumental three-volume work &quot;Sonata in the Classic Era (A History of the Sonata Idea)&quot;, begun in the 1950s and published in what has become the standard edition of all three volumes in 1972.

===20th-century theory===
Heinrich Schenker argued that there was an &quot;Urlinie&quot; or basic tonal melody, and a basic bass figuration. He held that when these two were present, there was basic structure, and that the sonata represented this basic structure in a whole work with a process known as &quot;interruption&quot;.

As a practical matter, Schenker applied his ideas to the editing of the piano sonatas of Beethoven, using original manuscripts and his own theories to &quot;correct&quot; the available sources. The basic procedure was the use of tonal theory to infer meaning from available sources as part of the critical process, even to the extent of completing works left unfinished by their composers. While many of these changes were and are controversial, that procedure has a central role today in music theory, and is an essential part of the theory of sonata structure as taught in most music schools.

<text>Ferdinand Joseph LaMothe ( Lemott, later Morton; c. September 20, 1890 – July 10, 1941), known professionally as Jelly Roll Morton, was an American blues and jazz pianist, bandleader, and composer of Louisiana Creole descent. Morton was jazz&#x27;s first arranger, proving that a genre rooted in improvisation could retain its essential characteristics when notated. His composition &quot;Jelly Roll Blues&quot;, published in 1915, was one of the first published jazz compositions. He also claimed to have invented the genre.

Morton also wrote &quot;King Porter Stomp&quot;, &quot;Wolverine Blues&quot;, &quot;Black Bottom Stomp&quot;, and &quot;I Thought I Heard Buddy Bolden Say&quot;, the last being a tribute to New Orleans musicians from the turn of the 20th century.

Morton&#x27;s claim to have invented jazz in 1902 was criticized. Music critic Scott Yanow wrote, &quot;Jelly Roll Morton did himself a lot of harm posthumously by exaggerating his worth ... Morton&#x27;s accomplishments as an early innovator are so vast that he did not really need to stretch the truth.&quot; Gunther Schuller says of Morton&#x27;s &quot;hyperbolic assertions&quot; that there is &quot;no proof to the contrary&quot; and that Morton&#x27;s &quot;considerable accomplishments in themselves provide reasonable substantiation.”

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Morton was born Ferdinand Joseph LaMothe (or Lemott), into the Creole community in the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood of New Orleans around 1890; he claimed to have been born in 1884 on his WWI draft registration card in 1918. Both parents traced their Creole ancestry four generations to the 18th century. Morton&#x27;s birth date and year of birth are uncertain, given that no birth certificate was ever issued for him. The law requiring birth certificates for citizens was not enforced until 1914. His parents were Martin-Edouard Joseph Lamothe, also known as Edward Joseph Lamothe, a bricklayer and occasional trombonist, and Louise Hermance Monette, a domestic worker. His parents were never legally married and his father left his mother when Morton was around three years old. After his mother married William Mouton in 1894, Ferdinand adopted his stepfather&#x27;s surname, anglicizing it to Morton, adapting &quot;Ferd&quot; as an unofficial forename. Ferd had two sisters, one of whom, Eugénie, married Ignace Colas, in 1913.

=== Career ===

At the age of fourteen, Morton began as a piano player in a brothel. He often sang smutty lyrics and used the nickname &quot;Jelly Roll&quot;, which was African-American slang for female genitalia. While working there, he was living with his churchgoing great-grandmother. He convinced her that he worked as a night watchman in a barrel factory. After Morton&#x27;s grandmother found out he was playing jazz in a brothel, she disowned him for disgracing the Lamothe name. &quot;When my grandmother found out that I was playing jazz in one of the sporting houses in the District, she told me that I had disgraced the family and forbade me to live at the house. She told me that devil music would surely bring about my downfall...&quot; The cornetist Rex Stewart recalled that Morton had chosen &quot;the nom de plume &#x27;Morton&#x27; to protect his family from disgrace if he was identified as a whorehouse &#x27;professor&#x27;.&quot;

Around 1904, Morton started touring in the US South, working in minstrel shows such as Will Benbow&#x27;s Chocolate Drops, gambling, and composing. His songs &quot;Jelly Roll Blues&quot;, &quot;New Orleans Blues&quot;, &quot;Frog-I-More Rag&quot;, &quot;Animule Dance&quot;, and &quot;King Porter Stomp&quot; were composed during this period. Stride pianists James P. Johnson and Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith saw him perform in Chicago in 1910 and New York City in 1911.

In 1912–14, Morton toured with his girlfriend Rosa Brown as a vaudeville act before living in Chicago for three years. By 1914, he was putting his compositions on paper. In 1915 &quot;Jelly Roll Blues&quot; was one of the first jazz compositions to be published. Jelly Roll Morton was employed by Ben Shook Jr. around 1916. Shook was associated with a Jubilee club led by Mabel Lewis, a contralto singer and former member of the original Fisk University Jubilee Singers. In 1917 he went to California with bandleader William Manuel Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s sister Anita Gonzalez, born Bessie Julia Johnson. Morton&#x27;s tango &quot;The Crave&quot; was popular in Hollywood. He was invited to perform at the Hotel Patricia nightclub in Vancouver, Canada. Author Mark Miller described his arrival as &quot;an extended period of itinerancy as a pianist, vaudeville performer, gambler, hustler, and, as legend would have it, pimp&quot;. Morton returned to Chicago in 1923 to claim authorship of &quot;The Wolverines&quot;, which had become popular as &quot;Wolverine Blues&quot;. He released the first of his commercial recordings, first as piano rolls, then on record, both as a piano soloist and with jazz bands.

In 1926, Morton signed a contract with the Victor Talking Machine Company, giving him the opportunity to bring a well-rehearsed band to play his arrangements in the Victor recording studios in Chicago. These recordings by Jelly Roll Morton and His Red Hot Peppers included Kid Ory, Omer Simeon, George Mitchell, Johnny St. Cyr, Barney Bigard, Johnny Dodds, Baby Dodds, and Andrew Hilaire.

After Morton moved to New York City, he continued to record for Victor. Although he had trouble finding musicians who wanted to play his style of jazz, he recorded with Omer Simeon, George Baquet, Albert Nicholas, Barney Bigard, Russell Procope, Lorenzo Tio and Artie Shaw, the trumpeters Ward Pinkett, Bubber Miley, Johnny Dunn and Henry &quot;Red&quot; Allen, Sidney Bechet, Paul Barnes, Bud Freeman, Pops Foster, Paul Barbarin, Cozy Cole, and Zutty Singleton. His New York sessions failed to produce a hit.

Due in part to the Great Depression, RCA Victor did not renew Morton&#x27;s recording contract for 1931. He continued playing in New York but struggled financially. He briefly had a radio show in 1934, then toured in a burlesque band. In 1935, his 30-year-old composition &quot;King Porter Stomp&quot;, arranged by Fletcher Henderson, became Benny Goodman&#x27;s first hit and a swing standard, but Morton received no royalties from the recordings.

==== Music Box interviews ====
In 1935, Morton moved to Washington, D.C., to become the manager and piano player at a bar called, at various times, the Music Box, Blue Moon Inn, and Jungle Inn, at 1211 U Street NW in Shaw, an African-American neighborhood. Morton was master of ceremonies, bouncer, and bartender. The club owner allowed her friends free admission and drinks, which prevented Morton from making the business a success. During Morton&#x27;s brief residency at the Music Box, the folklorist Alan Lomax heard him play. In May 1938, Lomax invited Morton to record music and interviews for the Library of Congress. The sessions were intended to be a short interview with musical examples for researchers at the Library of Congress, but the sessions expanded to over eight hours, with Morton talking and playing piano. Lomax conducted longer interviews, taking notes but not recording. Lomax was interested in Morton&#x27;s days in Storyville, New Orleans, and the ribald songs of the time. Although reluctant to record these, Morton obliged Lomax. Because of the suggestive nature of the songs, some of the Library of Congress recordings were not released until 2005.

In these interviews, Morton claimed to have been born in 1885. Morton scholars, such as Lawrence Gushee, say that Morton was aware that if he had been born in 1890, he would have been too young to claim to be the inventor of jazz. However, Morton may not have known his actual birthdate, and there remains the possibility that he was telling the truth. He said Buddy Bolden played ragtime but not jazz, a view not accepted by some of Bolden&#x27;s contemporaries in New Orleans. The contradictions may stem from different definitions of &quot;ragtime&quot; and &quot;jazz&quot;.

==== Stabbing, later life, and death ====
In 1938, Morton was stabbed by a friend of the Music Box&#x27;s owner and suffered wounds to the head and chest. A nearby whites-only hospital refused to treat him, as the city had racially segregated facilities. He was transported to a black hospital farther away. When he was in the hospital, doctors left ice on his wounds for several hours before attending to the injury. His recovery from his wounds was incomplete, and thereafter he was often ill and became short of breath easily. After this incident, his wife Mabel demanded they leave Washington.

Worsening asthma sent him to a hospital in New York for three months. He continued to suffer from respiratory problems when he travelled to Los Angeles with the intent to restart his career. He died on July 10, 1941, after an eleven-day stay in Los Angeles County General Hospital. He was generally believed to be 50 years old. According to the jazz historian David Gelly in 2000, Morton&#x27;s arrogance and &quot;bumptious&quot; persona alienated so many musicians that few of them attended his funeral.

An article about the funeral in the August 1, 1941, issue of &quot;DownBeat&quot; reported that his pallbearers were Kid Ory, Mutt Carey, Fred Washington, and Ed Garland. It noted that Duke Ellington and Jimmie Lunceford were absent, though both were appearing in Los Angeles at the time. Mercer Ellington, Duke Ellington&#x27;s son, did attend the funeral. The article was reproduced in &quot;Mister Jelly Roll&quot;, a 1950 biography of Morton by Alan Lomax.

== Personal life ==
Morton married Mabel Bertrand, a showgirl, in November 1928 in Gary, Indiana.

He was a &quot;very devout Catholic&quot;, according to Anita Gonzales, his long-term companion. His gravesite features a large rosary rather than any music imagery.

==Form and compositions==
Morton&#x27;s piano style was formed from early secondary ragtime and &quot;shout&quot;, which also evolved separately into the New York school of stride piano. Morton&#x27;s playing was also close to barrelhouse, which produced boogie-woogie.

Morton often played the melody of a tune with his right thumb, while sounding a harmony above these notes with the fingers of the right hand. This could add a rustic or &quot;out-of-tune&quot; sound due to the playing of a diminished 5th above the melody. This technique may still be recognized as belonging to New Orleans. Morton also walked in major and minor sixths in the bass, instead of tenths or octaves. He played basic swing rhythms with both the left and the right hand.

Several of Morton&#x27;s compositions were musical tributes to himself, including &quot;Winin&#x27; Boy&quot;, &quot;The Jelly Roll Blues&quot; (subtitled &quot;The Original Jelly-Roll&quot;); and &quot;Mr. Jelly Lord&quot;. In the big-band era, his &quot;King Porter Stomp&quot;, which Morton had written decades earlier, was a big hit for Fletcher Henderson and Benny Goodman; it became a standard covered by most other swing bands of that time. Morton claimed to have written some tunes that were copyrighted by others, including &quot;Alabama Bound&quot; and &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;. &quot;Sweet Peter&quot;, which Morton recorded in 1926, appears to be the source of the melody of the hit song &quot;All of Me&quot;, which was credited to Gerald Marks and Seymour Simons in 1931.

His musical influence continues in the work of Dick Hyman and Reginald Robinson.

== Legacy ==
In 2013, Katy Martin published an article arguing that Alan Lomax&#x27;s book of interviews put Morton in a negative light. Martin disagreed that Morton was an egotist.In being called a supreme egotist, Jelly Roll was often a victim of loose and lurid reporting. If we read the words that he himself wrote, however, we learn that he almost had an inferiority complex and said that he created his own style of jazz piano because &#x27;All my fellow musicians were much faster in manipulations, I thought than I, and I did not feel as though I was in their class.&#x27; So he used a slower tempo to permit flexibility through the use of more notes, a pinch of Spanish to give a number of right seasoning, the avoidance of playing triple forte continuously, and many other points.

Several decades later in 2022, Louis claims in his interview with Daniel Molloy, that it was Lestat&#x27;s improvisation of Morton&#x27;s music that contributes to the recording of Wolverine Blues.
* Morton is covered extensively in the 2011 book by Peggy Hicks, &quot;The Ghost of the Cuban Queen Bordello&quot;, detailing the life of Bessie Julia Johnson, also known as Anita Gonzales. Teenager Morton first knew Bessie/Anita as a prostitute in Storyville, then in 1917 he followed her to Las Vegas, Nevada, where she was a madam. They toured the US, buying a house together in Los Angeles. They moved to Jerome, Arizona, where she operated a bordello. They married in late 1918, quarreled frequently, moved around, and divorced. He traveled alone to Chicago. They kept in contact over the years, with Morton borrowing money. Morton sought her out at the end of his life, and died in her arms.

<doc id="44122" wikidata="Q25139" url="?curid=44122" title="American Beauty (1999 film)">
<text>American Beauty is a 1999 American psychological dark comedy-drama film written by Alan Ball and directed by Sam Mendes in his feature directorial debut. Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, an advertising executive who has a midlife crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter&#x27;s best friend, played by Mena Suvari. Annette Bening stars as Lester&#x27;s materialistic wife, Carolyn, and Thora Birch plays their insecure daughter, Jane. Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, and Allison Janney co-star. Academics have described the film as satirizing how beauty and personal satisfaction are perceived by the American middle class; further analysis has focused on the film&#x27;s explorations of romantic and paternal love, sexuality, materialism and self-liberation.

After being filmed in California from December 1998 to February 1999, &quot;American Beauty&quot; was released by DreamWorks Pictures in North America on September 17, 1999, receiving widespread critical and popular acclaim. It was the second-best-reviewed American film of the year behind &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; and grossed over $350 million worldwide against its $15-million budget, becoming the ninth highest-grossing film of 1999. DreamWorks launched a major campaign to increase &quot;American Beauty&quot;″s chances of Oscar success following its controversial Best Picture snub for &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998) the previous year.

At the 72nd Academy Awards, the film won five Oscars, including Best Picture, along with Best Director for Mendes, Best Actor for Spacey, Best Original Screenplay for Ball, and Best Cinematography for Hall. The film was nominated for and won many other awards and honors, mainly for directing, writing, and acting.

==Plot==
Lester Burnham, a middle-aged media executive in suburbia, despises his job and is unhappily married to neurotic, status-obsessed Carolyn, a real estate salesperson. Their 16-year-old daughter and only child, Jane, resents her parents and has low self-esteem. Retired Marine colonel Frank Fitts, his near-catatonic wife Barbara, and their teenage son Ricky move in next door. Ricky documents the world around him with a camcorder, collecting recordings on videotape in his bedroom, as he finds beauty in unexpected places and things. To pay for supplies, he deals marijuana, using his part-time catering jobs as a front. A strict and abusive disciplinarian, Frank previously had Ricky sent to a psychiatric hospital and military school. Gay couple Jim Olmeyer and Jim Berkley, also neighbors, welcome the Fitts family, angering the homophobic Frank.

One evening during a cheerleading routine at a school basketball game, Lester becomes infatuated with Jane&#x27;s friend Angela Hayes, who brags to her classmates about being sexually experienced. He starts having sexual fantasies about her, in which red rose petals are a recurring motif. Carolyn begins an affair with married real estate &quot;King&quot; Buddy Kane. Lester quits his job, blackmails his supervisor Brad into giving him a generous severance package, and starts working as a fry cook at a fast food restaurant. He also buys his dream car, a 1970 Pontiac Firebird, and starts regularly exercising with coaching from the Jims after overhearing Angela teasing Jane that she would have sex with Lester if he improved his physique. He begins smoking marijuana supplied by Ricky and returning Angela&#x27;s flirts. The girls&#x27; friendship wanes when Jane starts a relationship with Ricky; while Angela thinks he is strange, Jane appreciates him for focusing on the beauty he sees within her.

Buddy and Carolyn have a date at a gun shooting range. Lester then discovers Carolyn&#x27;s infidelity when they order a meal at the fast food&#x27;s drive through. Buddy fears a costly divorce and ends the affair, while Carolyn is humiliated and simultaneously frustrated by her lack of professional success. Frank finds Ricky&#x27;s recording of a nude Lester working out and becomes suspicious of their friendship, assuming that they are sexually involved after spying on their drug session. He viciously accuses Ricky of being gay and expels him from the house, to which Ricky defiantly agrees. Carolyn, driving home, withdraws a handgun from the glove box as she listens to a self-help tape. At home, Jane argues with Angela over the latter&#x27;s sexual interest in Lester when Ricky interrupts to ask Jane to leave with him for New York City before he dismisses Angela as uninteresting and unattractive.

Frank tentatively approaches Lester in the Burnhams&#x27; garage, then breaks down and tearfully embraces him. Lester comforts Frank and gently rebuffs Frank&#x27;s attempts to kiss him. Lester finds Angela alone and consoles her, then professes his attraction to her during their conversation. As he begins to undress her on the couch, she admits her virginity. Lester realizes that she had feigned being sexually experienced, and he cannot continue. He bonds with her as they share their frustrations. Angela goes to the bathroom as Lester smiles at a family photograph, when an unseen figure shoots him in the back of the head at point-blank range.

Ricky and Jane, who had earlier considered killing Lester themselves, find his body. Discovering the body herself, Carolyn hides in the master closet, discards her gun, and hugs Lester&#x27;s clothing. A blood-soaked Frank returns home, a gun missing from his collection. Lester&#x27;s closing narration describes meaningful experiences during his life, for which he expresses gratitude. Despite being murdered, he is finally happy, having found beauty in the world.

==Themes and analysis==

===Multiple interpretations===
Scholars and academics have offered many possible readings of &quot;American Beauty&quot;; film critics are similarly divided, not so much about the quality of the film, as their interpretations of it. Described by many as about &quot;the meaning of life&quot; or &quot;the hollow existence of the American suburbs&quot;, the film has defied categorization by even the filmmakers. Mendes is indecisive, saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it: &quot;a mystery story, a kaleidoscopic journey through American suburbia, a series of love stories; ... it was about imprisonment, ... loneliness, [and] beauty. It was funny; it was angry, sad.&quot;

Literary critic and author Wayne C. Booth concludes that the film resists any one interpretation: &quot;[&quot;American Beauty&quot;] cannot be adequately summarized as &#x27;here is a satire on what&#x27;s wrong with American life&#x27;; that plays down the celebration of beauty. It is more tempting to summarize it as &#x27;a portrait of the beauty underlying American miseries and misdeeds&#x27;, but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror, and Ball&#x27;s disgust with mores. It cannot be summarized with either Lester or Ricky&#x27;s philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live.&quot; He argues that the problem of interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its center—a controlling voice who &quot;[unites] all of the choices&quot;. He contends that in &quot;American Beauty&quot;″s case, it is neither Mendes nor Ball. Mendes considers the voice to be Ball&#x27;s, but even while the writer was &quot;strongly influential&quot; on set, he often had to accept deviations from his vision, particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic. With &quot;innumerable voices intruding on the original author&#x27;s,&quot; Booth says, those who interpret &quot;American Beauty&quot; &quot;have forgotten to probe for the elusive center&quot;. According to Booth, the film&#x27;s true controller is the creative energy &quot;that hundreds of people put into its production, agreeing and disagreeing, inserting and cutting&quot;.

===Imprisonment and redemption===

Mendes called &quot;American Beauty&quot; a rite of passage film about imprisonment and escape from imprisonment. The monotony of Lester&#x27;s existence is established through his gray, nondescript workplace and characterless clothing. In these scenes, he is often framed as if trapped, &quot;reiterating rituals that hardly please him&quot;. He masturbates in the confines of his shower; the shower stall evokes a jail cell and the shot is the first of many where Lester is confined behind bars or within frames, such as when he is reflected behind columns of numbers on a computer monitor, &quot;confined [and] nearly crossed out&quot;.

The academic and author Jody W. Pennington argues that Lester&#x27;s journey is the story&#x27;s center. His sexual reawakening through meeting Angela is the first of several turning points as he begins to &quot;[throw] off the responsibilities of the comfortable life he has come to despise&quot;. After Lester shares a joint with Ricky, his spirit is released and he begins to rebel against Carolyn. Changed by Ricky&#x27;s &quot;attractive, profound confidence&quot;, he is convinced that Angela is attainable and sees that he must question his &quot;banal, numbingly materialist suburban existence&quot;; he takes a job at a fast-food outlet, which allows him to regress to a point when he could &quot;see his whole life ahead of him&quot;.

When Lester is caught masturbating by Carolyn, his angry retort about their lack of intimacy is the first time he says aloud what he thinks about her. By confronting the issue and Carolyn&#x27;s &quot;superficial investments in others&quot;, he is trying to &quot;regain a voice in a home that [only respects] the voices of mother and daughter&quot;. His final turning point comes when he and Angela almost have sex; after she confesses her virginity, he no longer thinks of her as a sex object, but as a daughter. He holds her close and &quot;wraps her up&quot;. Mendes called it &quot;the most satisfying end to [Lester&#x27;s] journey there could possibly have been&quot;. With these final scenes, Mendes intended to show him at the conclusion of a &quot;mythical quest&quot;. After Lester gets a beer from the refrigerator, the camera pushes toward him, then stops facing a hallway down which he walks &quot;to meet his fate&quot;. Having begun to act his age again, Lester achieves closure. As he smiles at a family photo, the camera pans slowly from Lester to the kitchen wall, onto which blood spatters as a gunshot rings out; the slow pan reflects the peace of his death. His body is discovered by Jane and Ricky. Mendes said that Ricky&#x27;s staring into Lester&#x27;s dead eyes is &quot;the culmination of the theme&quot; of the film: that beauty is found where it is least expected.

===Conformity and beauty===
Like other American films of 1999—such as &quot;Fight Club&quot;, &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; and &quot;Magnolia&quot;, &quot;American Beauty&quot; instructs its audience to &quot;[lead] more meaningful lives&quot;. The film argues the case against conformity, but does not deny that people need and want it; even the gay characters just want to fit in. Jim and Jim, the Burnhams&#x27; other neighbors, are a satire of &quot;gay bourgeois coupledom&quot;, who &quot;[invest] in the numbing sameness&quot; that the film criticizes in heterosexual couples. The feminist academic and author Sally R. Munt argues that &quot;American Beauty&quot; uses its &quot;art house&quot; trappings to direct its message of nonconformity primarily to the middle classes, and that this approach is a &quot;&quot;cliché&quot; of bourgeois preoccupation; ... the underlying premise being that the luxury of finding an individual &#x27;self&#x27; through denial and renunciation is always open to those wealthy enough to choose, and sly enough to present themselves sympathetically as a rebel.&quot;

Professor Roy M. Anker argues that the film&#x27;s thematic center is its direction to the audience to &quot;look closer&quot;. The opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the Burnhams&#x27; neighborhood with Lester&#x27;s narrated admission that this is the last year of his life, forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them. It also sets a series of mysteries; Anker asks, &quot;from what place exactly, and from what state of being, is he telling this story? If he&#x27;s already dead, why bother with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive? There is also the question of how Lester has died—or will die.&quot; Anker believes the preceding scene—Jane&#x27;s discussion with Ricky about the possibility of his killing her father—adds further mystery.

Professor Ann C. Hall disagrees; she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery, the film allows the audience to put it aside &quot;to view the film and its philosophical issues&quot;. Through this examination of Lester&#x27;s life, rebirth and death, &quot;American Beauty&quot; satirizes American middle class notions of meaning, beauty and satisfaction. Even Lester&#x27;s transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela; he therefore remains a &quot;willing devotee of the popular media&#x27;s exaltation of pubescent male sexuality as a sensible route to personal wholeness&quot;. Carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness; from her belief in &quot;house beautiful&quot; domestic bliss to her car and gardening outfit, Carolyn&#x27;s domain is a &quot;fetching American millennial vision of Pleasantville, or Eden&quot;. The Burnhams are unaware that they are &quot;materialists philosophically, and devout consumers ethically&quot; who expect the &quot;rudiments of American beauty&quot; to give them happiness. Anker argues that &quot;they are helpless in the face of the prettified economic and sexual stereotypes ... that they and their culture have designated for their salvation.&quot;

The film presents Ricky as its &quot;visionary, ... spiritual and mystical center&quot;. He sees beauty in the minutiae of everyday life, videoing as much as he can for fear of missing it. He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed: a plastic bag, tossing in the wind in front of a wall. He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was &quot;an entire life behind things&quot;; he feels that &quot;sometimes there&#x27;s so much beauty in the world I feel like I can&#x27;t take it... and my heart is going to cave in.&quot; Anker argues that Ricky, in looking past the &quot;cultural dross&quot;, has the radiant splendor of the created world&quot; to see God. As the film progresses, the Burnhams move closer to Ricky&#x27;s view of the world. Lester only forswears personal satisfaction at the film&#x27;s end. On the cusp of having sex with Angela, he returns to himself after she admits her virginity. Suddenly confronted with a child, he begins to treat her as a daughter; in doing so, Lester sees himself, Angela, and his family &quot;for the poor and fragile but wondrous creatures they are&quot;. He looks at a picture of his family in happier times, and dies having had an epiphany that infuses him with &quot;wonder, joy, and soul-shaking gratitude&quot;—he has finally seen the world as it is.

According to Patti Bellantoni, colors are used symbolically throughout the film, none more so than red, which is an important thematic signature that drives the story and &quot;[defines] Lester&#x27;s arc&quot;. First seen in drab colors that reflect his passivity, Lester surrounds himself with red as he regains his individuality. The American Beauty rose is repeatedly used as symbol; when Lester fantasizes about Angela, she is usually naked and surrounded by rose petals. In these scenes, the rose symbolizes Lester&#x27;s desire for her. When associated with Carolyn, the rose represents a &quot;façade for suburban success&quot;. Roses are included in almost every shot inside the Burnhams&#x27; home, where they signify &quot;a mask covering a bleak, unbeautiful reality&quot;. Carolyn feels that &quot;as long as there can be roses, all is well&quot;. She cuts the roses and puts them in vases, where they adorn her &quot;meretricious vision of what makes for beauty&quot; and begin to die. The roses in the vase in the Angela–Lester seduction scene symbolize Lester&#x27;s previous life and Carolyn; the camera pushes in as Lester and Angela get closer, finally taking the roses—and thus Carolyn—out of the shot. Lester&#x27;s epiphany at the end of the film is expressed by rain and the use of red, building to a crescendo that is a deliberate contrast to the release Lester feels. The constant use of red &quot;lulls [the audience] subliminally&quot; into becoming used to it; consequently, it leaves the audience unprepared when Lester is shot and his blood spatters on the wall.

===Sexuality and repression===
Pennington argues that &quot;American Beauty&quot; defines its characters through their sexuality. Lester&#x27;s attempts to relive his youth are a direct result of his lust for Angela, and the state of his relationship with Carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact. Also sexually frustrated, Carolyn has an affair that takes her from &quot;cold perfectionist&quot; to more of a carefree soul who &quot;[sings] happily along with&quot; the music in her car. Jane and Angela constantly reference sex, through Angela&#x27;s descriptions of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls address each other. Their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability. By the end of the film, Angela&#x27;s hold on Jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is Lester&#x27;s attraction to her. Col. Fitts reacts with disgust to meeting Jim and Jim; he asks, &quot;How come these faggots always have to rub it in your face? How can they be so shameless?&quot; To which Ricky replies, &quot;That&#x27;s the thing, Dad—they don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s anything to be ashamed of.&quot; Pennington argues that Col. Fitts&#x27;s reaction is not homophobic, but an &quot;anguished self-interrogation&quot;.

With other turn-of-the-millennium films such as &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999), &quot;In the Company of Men&quot; (1997), &quot;American Psycho&quot; (2000), and &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; (1999), &quot;American Beauty&quot; &quot;raises the broader, widely explored issue of masculinity in crisis&quot;. Professor Vincent Hausmann charges that in their reinforcement of masculinity &quot;against threats posed by war, by consumerism, and by feminist and queer challenges&quot;, these films present a need to &quot;focus on, and even to privilege&quot; aspects of maleness &quot;deemed &#x27;deviant. Lester&#x27;s transformation conveys &quot;that he, and not the woman, has borne the brunt of [lack of being]&quot; and he will not stand for being emasculated. Lester&#x27;s attempts to &quot;strengthen traditional masculinity&quot; conflict with his responsibilities as a father. Although the film portrays the way Lester returns to that role positively, he does not become &quot;the hypermasculine figure implicitly celebrated in films like &quot;Fight Club&quot;&quot;. Hausmann concludes that Lester&#x27;s behavior toward Angela is &quot;a misguided but nearly necessary step toward his becoming a father again&quot;.

Hausmann says the film &quot;explicitly affirms the importance of upholding the prohibition against incest&quot;; a recurring theme of Ball&#x27;s work is his comparison of the taboos against incest and homosexuality. Instead of making an overt distinction, &quot;American Beauty&quot; looks at how their repression can lead to violence. Col. Fitts is so ashamed of his homosexuality that it drives him to murder Lester. Ball said, &quot;The movie is in part about how homophobia is based in fear and repression and about what [they] can do.&quot; The film implies two unfulfilled incestuous desires: Lester&#x27;s pursuit of Angela is a manifestation of his lust for his own daughter, while Col. Fitts&#x27;s repression is exhibited through the almost sexualized discipline with which he controls Ricky. Consequently, Ricky realizes that he can only hurt his father by falsely telling him he is homosexual, while Angela&#x27;s vulnerability and submission to Lester reminds him of his responsibilities and the limits of his fantasy. Col. Fitts represents Ball&#x27;s father, whose repressed homosexual desires led to his own unhappiness. Ball rewrote Col. Fitts to delay revealing him as homosexual.

===Temporality and music===
&quot;American Beauty&quot; follows a traditional narrative structure, only deviating with the displaced opening scene of Jane and Ricky from the middle of the story. Although the plot spans one year, the film is narrated by Lester at the moment of his death. Jacqueline Furby says that the plot &quot;occupies ... no time [or] all time&quot;, citing Lester&#x27;s claim that life did not flash before his eyes, but that it &quot;stretches on forever like an ocean of time&quot;. Furby argues that a &quot;rhythm of repetition&quot; forms the core of the film&#x27;s structure. For example, two scenes have the Burnhams sitting down to an evening meal, shot from the same angle. Each image is broadly similar, with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by Lester&#x27;s new-found assertiveness. Another example is the pair of scenes in which Jane and Ricky film each other. Ricky films Jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra, and the image is reversed later for a similarly &quot;voyeuristic and exhibitionist&quot; scene in which Jane films Ricky at a vulnerable moment.
Lester&#x27;s fantasies are emphasized by slow- and repetitive-motion shots; Mendes uses double-and-triple cutbacks in several sequences, and the score alters to make the audience aware that it is entering a fantasy. One example is the gymnasium scene—Lester&#x27;s first encounter with Angela. While the cheerleaders perform their half-time routine to &quot;On Broadway&quot;, Lester becomes increasingly fixated on Angela. Time slows to represent his &quot;voyeuristic hypnosis&quot; and Lester begins to fantasize that Angela&#x27;s performance is for him alone. &quot;On Broadway&quot;—which provides a conventional underscore to the onscreen action—is replaced by discordant, percussive music that lacks melody or progression. This nondiegetic score is important to creating the narrative stasis in the sequence; it conveys a moment for Lester that is stretched to an indeterminate length. The effect is one that Stan Link likens to &quot;vertical time&quot;, described by the composer and music theorist Jonathan Kramer as music that imparts &quot;a single present stretched out into an enormous duration, a potentially infinite &#x27;now&#x27; that nonetheless feels like an instant&quot;. The music is used like a visual cue, so that Lester and the score are staring at Angela. The sequence ends with the sudden reintroduction of &quot;On Broadway&quot; and teleological time.

According to Drew Miller of &quot;Stylus&quot;, the soundtrack &quot;[gives] unconscious voice&quot; to the characters&#x27; psyches and complements the subtext. The most obvious use of pop music &quot;accompanies and gives context to&quot; Lester&#x27;s attempts to recapture his youth; reminiscent of how the counterculture of the 1960s combated American repression through music and drugs, Lester begins to smoke cannabis and listen to rock music. Mendes&#x27;s song choices &quot;progress through the history of American popular music&quot;. Miller argues that although some may be over familiar, there is a parodic element at work, &quot;making good on [the film&#x27;s] encouragement that viewers look closer&quot;. Toward the end of the film, Thomas Newman&#x27;s score features more prominently, creating &quot;a disturbing tempo&quot; that matches the tension of the visuals. The exception is &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Bring You Down&quot;, which plays during Angela&#x27;s seduction of Lester. At first appropriate, its tone clashes as the seduction stops. The lyrics, which speak of &quot;castles burning&quot;, can be seen as a metaphor for Lester&#x27;s view of Angela—&quot;the rosy, fantasy-driven exterior of the &#x27;American Beauty—as it burns away to reveal &quot;the timid, small-breasted girl who, like his wife, has willfully developed a false public self&quot;.

==Production==

===Development===
Alan Ball began writing &quot;American Beauty&quot; as a play in the early 1990s, partly inspired by the media circus that accompanied the Amy Fisher trial in 1992. He shelved the play after deciding that the story would not work on stage. After spending the next few years writing for television, Ball revived the idea in 1997 when attempting to break into the film industry after several frustrating years writing for the television sitcoms &quot;Grace Under Fire&quot; and &quot;Cybill&quot;. He joined the United Talent Agency, where his representative, Andrew Cannava, suggested he write a spec script to &quot;reintroduce [himself] to the town as a screenwriter&quot;. Ball pitched three ideas to Cannava: two conventional romantic comedies and &quot;American Beauty.&quot; Despite the story&#x27;s lack of an easily marketable concept, Cannava selected &quot;American Beauty&quot; because he felt it was the one for which Ball had the most passion. While developing the script, Ball created another television sitcom, &quot;Oh, Grow Up&quot;. He channeled his anger and frustration at having to accede to network demands on that show—and during his tenures on &quot;Grace Under Fire&quot; and &quot;Cybill&quot;—into writing &quot;American Beauty&quot;.

Ball did not expect to sell the script, believing it would act as more of a calling card, but &quot;American Beauty&quot; drew interest from several production bodies. Cannava passed the script to several producers, including Dan Jinks and Bruce Cohen, who took it to DreamWorks. With the help of executives Glenn Williamson and Bob Cooper, and Steven Spielberg in his capacity as studio partner, Ball was convinced to develop the project at DreamWorks; he received assurances from the studio—known at the time for its more conventional fare—that it would not &quot;iron the [edges] out&quot;. In an unusual move, DreamWorks decided not to option the script; instead, in April 1998, the studio bought it outright for $250,000, outbidding Fox Searchlight Pictures, October Films, The Samuel Goldwyn Company, and Lakeshore Entertainment. DreamWorks planned to make the film for $6–8 million.

Jinks and Cohen involved Ball throughout the film&#x27;s development, including casting and director selection. The producers met with about twenty interested directors, several of whom were considered A-list at the time. Ball was not keen on the more well-known directors because he believed their involvement would increase the budget and lead DreamWorks to become &quot;nervous about the content&quot;. Nevertheless, DreamWorks offered the film to Mike Nichols and Robert Zemeckis; neither accepted. In the same year, Sam Mendes (then a theater director) revived the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot; in New York with fellow director Rob Marshall. Beth Swofford of the Creative Artists Agency arranged meetings for Mendes with studio figures in Los Angeles to see if film direction was a possibility. Mendes came across &quot;American Beauty&quot; in a pile of eight scripts at Swofford&#x27;s house, and knew immediately that it was the one he wanted to make; early in his career, he had been inspired by how the film &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; (1984) presented contemporary America as a mythic landscape and he saw the same theme in &quot;American Beauty&quot;, as well as parallels with his own childhood. Mendes later met with Spielberg; impressed by Mendes&#x27;s productions of &quot;Oliver!&quot; and &quot;Cabaret&quot;, Spielberg encouraged him to consider &quot;American Beauty&quot;.

Mendes found that he still had to convince DreamWorks&#x27;s production executives to let him direct. He had already discussed the film with Jinks and Cohen, and felt they supported him. Ball was also keen; having seen &quot;Cabaret&quot;, he was impressed with Mendes&#x27;s &quot;keen visual sense&quot; and thought he did not make obvious choices. Ball felt that Mendes liked to look under the story&#x27;s surface, a talent he felt would be a good fit with the themes of &quot;American Beauty&quot;. Mendes&#x27;s background also reassured him, because of the prominent role the playwright usually has in a theater production. Over two meetings—the first with Cooper, Walter Parkes, and Laurie MacDonald, the second with Cooper alone—Mendes pitched himself to the studio. The studio soon approached Mendes with a deal to direct for the minimum salary allowed under Directors Guild of America rules—$150,000. Mendes accepted, and later recalled that after taxes and his agent&#x27;s commission, he only earned $38,000. In June 1998, DreamWorks confirmed that it had contracted Mendes to direct the film.

===Writing===

Ball was partly inspired by two encounters he had in the early 1990s. In about 1991–92, Ball saw a plastic bag blowing in the wind outside the World Trade Center. He watched the bag for ten minutes, saying later that it provoked an &quot;unexpected emotional response&quot;. In 1992, Ball became preoccupied with the media circus that accompanied the Amy Fisher trial. Discovering a comic book telling of the scandal, he was struck by how quickly it had become commercialized. He said he &quot;felt like there was a real story underneath [that was] more fascinating and way more tragic&quot; than the story presented to the public, and attempted to turn the idea into a play. Ball produced around 40 pages, but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film. He felt that because of the visual themes, and because each character&#x27;s story was &quot;intensely personal&quot;, it could not be done on a stage. All the main characters appeared in this version, but Carolyn did not feature strongly; Jim and Jim instead had much larger roles.

Ball based Lester&#x27;s story on aspects of his own life. Lester&#x27;s re-examination of his life parallels feelings Ball had in his mid-30s; like Lester, Ball put aside his passions to work in jobs he hated for people he did not respect. Scenes in Ricky&#x27;s household reflect Ball&#x27;s own childhood experiences. Ball suspected his father was homosexual and used the idea to create Col. Fitts, a man who &quot;gave up his chance to be himself&quot;. Ball said the script&#x27;s mix of comedy and drama was not intentional, but that it came unconsciously from his own outlook on life. He said the juxtaposition produced a starker contrast, giving each trait more impact than if they appeared alone.

In the script that was sent to prospective actors and directors, Lester and Angela had sex; by the time of shooting, Ball had rewritten the scene to the final version. Ball initially rebuffed counsel from others that he change the script, feeling they were being puritanical; the final impetus to alter the scene came from DreamWorks&#x27;s then-president Walter Parkes. He convinced Ball by indicating that in Greek mythology, the hero &quot;has a moment of epiphany before ... tragedy occurs&quot;. Ball later said his anger when writing the first draft had blinded him to the idea that Lester needed to refuse sex with Angela to complete his emotional journey—to achieve redemption. Jinks and Cohen asked Ball not to alter the scene right away, as they felt it would be inappropriate to make changes to the script before a director had been hired. Early drafts also included a flashback to Col. Fitts&#x27;s service in the Marines, a sequence that unequivocally established his homosexual leanings. In love with another Marine, Col. Fitts sees the man die and comes to believe that he is being punished for the &quot;sin&quot; of being gay. Ball removed the sequence because it did not fit the structure of the rest of the film—Col. Fitts was the only character to have a flashback—and because it removed the element of surprise from Col. Fitts&#x27;s later pass at Lester. Ball said he had to write it for his own benefit to know what happened to Col. Fitts, though all that remained in later drafts was subtext.

Ball remained involved throughout production; he had signed a television show development deal, so had to get permission from his producers to take a year off to be close to &quot;American Beauty&quot;. Ball was on-set for rewrites and to help interpret his script for all but two days of filming. His original bookend scenes—in which Ricky and Jane are prosecuted for Lester&#x27;s murder after being framed by Col. Fitts—were excised in post-production; the writer later felt the scenes were unnecessary, saying they were a reflection of his &quot;anger and cynicism&quot; at the time of writing . Ball and Mendes revised the script twice before it was sent to the actors, and twice more before the first read-through. The script was written between June 1997 and February 1998.

The shooting script features a scene in Angela&#x27;s car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty; the scene differed from earlier versions, which set it as a &quot;big scene on a freeway&quot; in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body. The change was a practical decision, as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs. The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash, but only half a day was available. Ball agreed, but only if the scene could retain a line of Ricky&#x27;s where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman: &quot;When you see something like that, it&#x27;s like God is looking right at you, just for a second. And if you&#x27;re careful, you can look right back.&quot; Jane asks: &quot;And what do you see?&quot; Ricky: &quot;Beauty.&quot; Ball said, &quot;They wanted to cut that scene. They said it&#x27;s not important. I said, &#x27;You&#x27;re out of your fucking mind. It&#x27;s one of the most important scenes in the movie!&#x27; ... If any one line is the heart and soul of this movie, that is the line.&quot; Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence; set in a schoolyard, it presents a &quot;turning point&quot; for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela. By the end of filming, the script had been through ten drafts.

===Casting===

Mendes had Kevin Spacey and Bening in mind for the leads from the beginning, but DreamWorks executives were unenthusiastic. DreamWorks suggested several alternatives, including Bruce Willis, Kevin Costner, and John Travolta to play Lester (the role was also offered to Chevy Chase, but he turned it down), while Helen Hunt or Holly Hunter were proposed to play Carolyn. Mendes did not want a big star &quot;weighing the film down&quot;; he felt Spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the 1995 films &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; and &quot;Seven&quot;, and 1992&#x27;s &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot;. Spacey was surprised; he said, &quot;I usually play characters who are very quick, very manipulative and smart. ... I usually wade in dark, sort of treacherous waters. This is a man living one step at a time, playing by his instincts. This is actually much closer to me, to what I am, than those other parts.&quot; Mendes offered Annette Bening the role of Carolyn without DreamWorks&#x27; consent; although executives were upset at Mendes, by September 1998, DreamWorks had entered negotiations with Spacey and Bening.

Spacey loosely based Lester&#x27;s early &quot;schlubby&quot; deportment on Walter Matthau. During the film, Lester&#x27;s physique improves from flabby to toned; Spacey worked out during filming to improve his body, but because Mendes shot the scenes out of chronological order, Spacey varied postures to portray the stages. Before filming, Mendes and Spacey analyzed Jack Lemmon&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Apartment&quot; (1960), because Mendes wanted Spacey to emulate &quot;the way [Lemmon] moved, the way he looked, the way he was in that office and the way he was an ordinary man and yet a special man&quot;. Spacey&#x27;s voiceover is a throwback to &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950), which is also narrated in retrospect by a dead character. Mendes felt it evoked Lester&#x27;s—and the film&#x27;s—loneliness. Bening recalled women from her youth to inform her performance: &quot;I used to babysit constantly. You&#x27;d go to church and see how people present themselves on the outside, and then be inside their house and see the difference.&quot; Bening and a hair stylist collaborated to create a &quot;PTA president coif&quot; hairstyle, and Mendes and production designer Naomi Shohan researched mail-order catalogs to better establish Carolyn&#x27;s environment of a &quot;spotless suburban manor&quot;. To help Bening get into Carolyn&#x27;s mindset, Mendes gave her music that he believed Carolyn would like. He lent Bening the Bobby Darin version of the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Rain on My Parade&quot;, which she enjoyed and persuaded the director to include it for a scene in which Carolyn sings in her car.

Kirsten Dunst was offered the role of Angela Hayes, but she turned it down because of the character and Lester&#x27;s sexual behaviors. Sarah Michelle Gellar also declined the same role, due to scheduling conflicts with &quot;Buffy The Vampire Slayer&quot;.

For the roles of Jane, Ricky, and Angela, DreamWorks gave Mendes &quot;carte blanche&quot;. By November 1998, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari had been cast in the parts—in Birch&#x27;s case, despite the fact she was 16 years old and was deemed underage for a brief nude scene, which her parents had to approve. Child labor representatives accompanied Birch&#x27;s parents on set during the filming of the nude scene. Bentley overcame competition from top actors under the age of 25 to be cast. The 2009 documentary &quot;My Big Break&quot; followed Bentley, and several other young actors, before and after he landed the part. To prepare, Mendes provided Bentley with a video camera, telling the actor to film what Ricky would. Peter Gallagher and Allison Janney were cast (as Buddy Kane and Barbara Fitts) after filming began in December 1998. Mendes gave Janney a book of paintings by Edvard Munch. He told her, &quot;Your character is in there somewhere.&quot; Mendes cut much of Barbara&#x27;s dialogue, including conversations between Colonel Frank Fitts and her, as he felt that what needed to be said about the pair—their humanity and vulnerability—was conveyed successfully through their shared moments of silence. Chris Cooper plays Colonel Frank Fitts, Scott Bakula plays Jim Olmeyer, and Sam Robards plays Jim Berkley. Jim and Jim were deliberately depicted as the most normal, happy—and boring—couple in the film. Ball&#x27;s inspiration for the characters came from a thought he had after seeing a &quot;bland, boring, heterosexual couple&quot; who wore matching clothes: &quot;I can&#x27;t wait for the time when a gay couple can be just as boring.&quot; Ball also included aspects of a gay couple he knew who had the same forename.

Mendes insisted on two weeks of cast rehearsals, although the sessions were not as formal as he was used to in the theater, and the actors could not be present at every one. Several improvisations and suggestions by the actors were incorporated into the script. An early scene showing the Burnhams leaving home for work was inserted later on to show the low point that Carolyn and Lester&#x27;s relationship had reached. Spacey and Bening worked to create a sense of the love that Lester and Carolyn once had for one another; for example, the scene in which Lester almost seduces Carolyn after the pair argues over Lester&#x27;s buying a car was originally &quot;strictly contentious&quot;.

===Filming===
Principal photography lasted about 50 days, from December 14, 1998 to February 1999. &quot;American Beauty&quot; was filmed on soundstages at the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, California, and at Hancock Park and Brentwood in Los Angeles. The aerial shots at the beginning and end of the film were captured in Sacramento, California, and many of the school scenes were shot at South High School in Torrance, California; several extras in the gym crowd were South High students. The film is set in an upper middle-class neighborhood in an unidentified American town. Production designer Naomi Shohan likened the locale to Evanston, Illinois, but said, &quot;it&#x27;s not about a place, it&#x27;s about an archetype... The milieu was pretty much Anywhere, USA—upwardly mobile suburbia.&quot; The intent was for the setting to reflect the characters, who are also archetypes. Shohan said, &quot;All of them are very strained, and their lives are constructs.&quot; The Burnhams&#x27; household was designed as the reverse of the Fitts&#x27;—the former a pristine ideal, but graceless and lacking in &quot;inner balance&quot;, leading to Carolyn&#x27;s desire to at least give it the appearance of a &quot;perfect all-American household&quot;; the Fitts&#x27;s home is depicted in &quot;exaggerated darkness [and] symmetry&quot;.
The production selected two adjacent properties on the Warner backlot&#x27;s &quot;Blondie Street&quot; for the Burnham and Fitts&#x27;s homes. The crew rebuilt the houses to incorporate false rooms that established lines of sight—between Ricky and Jane&#x27;s bedroom windows, and between Ricky&#x27;s bedroom and Lester&#x27;s garage. The garage windows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which Col. Fitts—watching from Ricky&#x27;s bedroom—mistakenly assumes that Lester is paying Ricky for sex. Mendes made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of familiarity with the shot. The house interiors were filmed on the backlot, on location, and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed. The inside of the Burnhams&#x27; home was shot at a house close to Interstate 405 and Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles; the inside of the Fitts&#x27;s home was shot in the city&#x27;s Hancock Park neighborhood. Ricky&#x27;s bedroom was designed to be cell-like to suggest his &quot;monkish&quot; personality, while at the same time blending with the high-tech equipment to reflect his voyeuristic side. The production deliberately minimized the use of red, as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere. The Burnhams&#x27; home uses cool blues, while the Fitts&#x27;s is kept in a &quot;depressed military palette&quot;.

Mendes&#x27;s dominating visual style was deliberate and composed, with a minimalist design that provided &quot;a sparse, almost surreal feeling—a bright, crisp, hard edged, near Magritte-like take on American suburbia&quot;; Mendes constantly directed his set dressers to empty the frame. He made Lester&#x27;s fantasy scenes &quot;more fluid and graceful&quot;, and Mendes made minimal use of steadicams, feeling that stable shots generated more tension. For example, when Mendes used a slow push in to the Burnhams&#x27; dinner table, he held the shot because his training as a theater director taught him the importance of putting distance between the characters. He wanted to keep the tension in the scene, so he only cut away when Jane left the table. Mendes used a hand-held camera for the scene in which Col. Fitts beats Ricky. Mendes said the camera provided the scene with a &quot;kinetic ... off-balance energy&quot;. He also went hand-held for the excerpts of Ricky&#x27;s camcorder footage. Mendes took a long time to get the quality of Ricky&#x27;s footage to the level he wanted. For the plastic-bag footage, Mendes used wind machines to move the bag in the air. The scene took four takes; two by the second unit did not satisfy Mendes, so he shot the scene himself. He felt his first take lacked grace, but for the last attempt, he changed the location to the front of a brick wall and added leaves on the ground. Mendes was satisfied by the way the wall gave definition to the outline of the bag.

Mendes avoided using close-ups, believing the technique was overused. He also mentioned Spielberg&#x27;s advice to imagine an audience silhouetted at the bottom of the camera monitor, to keep in mind that it was being shot for display on a screen. Spielberg—who visited the set a few times—also advised Mendes not to worry about costs if he had a &quot;great idea&quot; toward the end of a long working day. Mendes said, &quot;That happened three or four times, and they are all in the movie.&quot; Despite Spielberg&#x27;s support, DreamWorks and Mendes fought constantly over the schedule and budget, although the studio interfered little with the film&#x27;s content. Spacey, Bening and Hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates. &quot;American Beauty&quot; cost DreamWorks $15 million to produce, slightly above their projected sum. Mendes was so dissatisfied with his first three days&#x27; filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks to reshoot the scenes. He said, &quot;I started with a wrong scene, actually, a comedy scene. And the actors played it way too big: ... it was badly shot, my fault, badly composed, my fault, bad costumes, my fault ...; and everybody was doing what I was asking. It was all my fault.&quot; Aware that he was a novice, Mendes drew on the experience of Hall: &quot;I made a very conscious decision early on, if I didn&#x27;t understand something technically, to say, without embarrassment, &#x27;I don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re talking about, please explain it.

Mendes encouraged some improvisation; for example, when Lester masturbates in bed beside Carolyn, the director asked Spacey to improvise several euphemisms for the act in each take. Mendes said, &quot;I wanted that not just because it was funny ... but because I didn&#x27;t want it to seem rehearsed. I wanted it to seem like he was blurting it out of his mouth without thinking. [Spacey] is so in control—I wanted him to break through.&quot; Spacey obliged, eventually coming up with 35 phrases, but Bening could not always keep a straight face, which meant the scene had to be shot ten times. The production used small amounts of computer-generated imagery. Most of the rose petals in Lester&#x27;s fantasies were added in post-production, although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed. When Lester fantasizes about Angela in a rose-petal bath, the steam was real, save for in the overhead shot. To position the camera, a hole had to be cut in the ceiling, through which the steam escaped; it was instead added digitally.

===Editing===
&quot;American Beauty&quot; was edited by Christopher Greenbury and Tariq Anwar; Greenbury began in the position, but had to leave halfway through post-production because of a scheduling conflict with &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot; (2000). Mendes and an assistant edited the film for ten days between the appointments. Mendes realized during editing that the film was different from the one he had envisioned. He believed he had been making a &quot;much more whimsical, ... kaleidoscopic&quot; film than what came together in the edit suite. Instead, Mendes was drawn to the emotion and darkness; he began to use the score and shots he had intended to discard to craft the film along these lines. In total, he cut about 30 minutes from his original edit.

The opening included a dream in which Lester imagines himself flying above the town. Mendes spent two days filming Spacey against bluescreen, but removed the sequence as he believed it to be too whimsical—&quot;like a Coen brothers movie&quot;—and therefore inappropriate for the tone he was trying to set. The opening in the final cut reused a scene from the middle of the film where Jane tells Ricky to kill her father. This scene was to be the revelation to the audience that the pair was not responsible for Lester&#x27;s death, as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that Jane&#x27;s request was not serious. However, in the portion he used in the opening—and when the full scene plays out later—Mendes used the score and a reaction shot of Ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt. The subsequent shot—an aerial view of the neighborhood—was originally intended as the plate shot for the bluescreen effects in the dream sequence.

Mendes spent more time recutting the first ten minutes than the rest of the film taken together. He trialed several versions of the opening; the first edit included bookend scenes in which Jane and Ricky are convicted of Lester&#x27;s murder, but Mendes excised these in the last week of editing because he felt they made the film lose its mystery, and because they did not fit with the theme of redemption that had emerged during production. Mendes believed the trial drew focus away from the characters and turned the film &quot;into an episode of &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;&quot;. Instead, he wanted the ending to be &quot;a poetic mixture of dream and memory and narrative resolution&quot;. When Ball first saw a completed edit, it was a version with truncated versions of these scenes. He felt that they were so short that they &quot;didn&#x27;t really register&quot;. Mendes and he argued, but Ball was more accepting after Mendes cut the sequences completely; Ball felt that without the scenes, the film was more optimistic and had evolved into something that &quot;for all its darkness had a really romantic heart&quot;.

===Cinematography===
Conrad Hall was not the first choice for director of photography; Mendes believed he was &quot;too old and too experienced&quot; to want the job, and he had been told that Hall was difficult to work with. Instead, Mendes asked Frederick Elmes, who turned the job down because he did not like the script. Hall was recommended to Mendes by Tom Cruise, because of Hall&#x27;s work on &quot;Without Limits&quot; (1998), which Cruise had executive produced. Mendes was directing Cruise&#x27;s then-wife Nicole Kidman in the play &quot;The Blue Room&quot; during preproduction on &quot;American Beauty&quot;, and had already storyboarded the whole film. Hall was involved for one month during preproduction; his ideas for lighting the film began with his first reading of the script, and further passes allowed him to refine his approach before meeting Mendes. Hall was initially concerned that audiences would not like the characters; he only felt able to identify with them during cast rehearsals, which gave him fresh ideas on his approach to the visuals.

Hall&#x27;s approach was to create peaceful compositions that evoked classicism, to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events and allow audiences to take in the action. Hall and Mendes first discussed the intended mood of a scene, but he was allowed to light the shot in any way he felt necessary. In most cases, Hall first lit the scene&#x27;s subject by &quot;painting in&quot; the blacks and whites, before adding fill light, which he reflected from beadboard or white card on the ceiling. This approach gave Hall more control over the shadows while keeping the fill light unobtrusive and the dark areas free of spill. Hall shot &quot;American Beauty&quot; in a 2.39:1 aspect ratio in the Super 35 format, primarily using Kodak Vision 500T 5279 35 mm film stock. He used Super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners of the petal-filled pool in its overhead shot, creating a frame around Angela within. He shot the whole film at the same T-stop (T1.9); given his preference for shooting that wide, Hall favored high-speed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects.

Hall used Panavision Platinum cameras with the company&#x27;s Primo series of prime and zoom lenses. Hall employed Kodak Vision 200T 5274 and EXR 100T 5248 stock for scenes with daylight effects. He had difficulty adjusting to Kodak&#x27;s newly introduced Vision release print stock, which, combined with his contrast-heavy lighting style, created a look with too much contrast. Hall contacted Kodak, who sent him a batch of 5279 that was five percent lower in contrast. Hall used a 1/8th strength Tiffen Black ProMist filter for almost every scene, which he said in retrospect may not have been the best choice, as the optical steps required to blow Super 35 up for its anamorphic release print led to a slight amount of degradation; therefore, the diffusion from the filter was not required. When he saw the film in a theater, Hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter, the diffusion from the Super 35–anamorphic conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended.

A shot where Lester and Ricky share a cannabis joint behind a building came from a misunderstanding between Hall and Mendes. Mendes asked Hall to prepare the shot in his absence; Hall assumed the characters would look for privacy, so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building, intending to light from the top of the truck. When Mendes returned, he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen. He removed the truck and Hall had to rethink the lighting; he lit it from the left, with a large light crossing the actors, and with a soft light behind the camera. Hall felt the consequent wide shot &quot;worked perfectly for the tone of the scene&quot;. Hall made sure to keep rain, or the suggestion of it, in every shot near the end of the film. In one shot during Lester&#x27;s encounter with Angela at the Burnhams&#x27; home, Hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights; in another, he partly lit the pair through French windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower, intensifying the light (although the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene, Hall felt it justified because of the strong contrasts it produced). For the close-ups when Lester and Angela move to the couch, Hall tried to keep rain in the frame, lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester. He also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room.

===Music===

Thomas Newman&#x27;s score was recorded in Santa Monica, California. He used mainly percussion instruments to create the mood and rhythm, the inspiration for which was provided by Mendes. Newman &quot;favored pulse, rhythm, and color over melody&quot;, making for a more minimalist score than he had previously created. He built each cue around &quot;small, endlessly repeating phrases&quot;—often, the only variety through a &quot;thinning of the texture for eight bars&quot;. The percussion instruments included tablas, bongos, cymbals, piano, xylophones, and marimbas; also featured were guitars, flute, and world music instruments. Newman also used electronic music and on &quot;quirkier&quot; tracks employed more unorthodox methods, such as tapping metal mixing bowls with a finger and using a detuned mandolin. Newman believed the score helped move the film along without disturbing the &quot;moral ambiguity&quot; of the script: &quot;It was a real delicate balancing act in terms of what music worked to preserve [that].&quot;

The soundtrack features songs by Newman, Bobby Darin, the Who (&quot;The Seeker&quot;), Free, Eels, the Guess Who, Bill Withers, Betty Carter, Peggy Lee, the Folk Implosion, Gomez, and Bob Dylan, as well as two cover versions—the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Because&quot;, performed by Elliott Smith, and Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Bring You Down&quot;, performed by Annie Lennox. Produced by the film&#x27;s music supervisor Chris Douridas, an abridged soundtrack album was released on October 5, 1999, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Album. An album featuring 19 tracks from Newman&#x27;s score was released on January 11, 2000, and won the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album. &quot;Filmmaker&quot; considered the score one of Newman&#x27;s best, saying it &quot;[enabled] the film&#x27;s transcendentalist aspirations&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Filmmaker&quot; chose the score as one of twenty essential soundtracks it believed spoke to the &quot;complex and innovative relationships between music and screen storytelling&quot;.

==Release==

===Publicity===
DreamWorks contracted Amazon.com to create the official website, marking the first time that Amazon had created a special section devoted to a feature film. The website included an overview, a photo gallery, cast and crew filmographies, and exclusive interviews with Spacey and Bening. The film&#x27;s tagline—&quot;look closer&quot;—originally came from a cutting pasted on Lester&#x27;s workplace cubicle by the set dresser. DreamWorks ran parallel marketing campaigns and trailers—one aimed at adults, the other at teenagers. Both trailers ended with the poster image of a girl holding a rose.

Reviewing the posters of several films of the year, David Hochman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated &quot;American Beauty&quot;″s highly, saying it evoked the tagline; he said, &quot;You return to the poster again and again, thinking, this time you&#x27;re gonna find something.&quot; DreamWorks did not want to test screen the film; according to Mendes, the studio was pleased with it, but he insisted on one where he could question the audience afterward. The studio reluctantly agreed and showed the film to a young audience in San Jose, California. Mendes claimed the screening went very well.

===Theatrical run===
The film had its world premiere on September 8, 1999, at Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Three days later, the film appeared at the Toronto International Film Festival. With the filmmakers and cast in attendance, it screened at several American universities, including the University of California at Berkeley, New York University, the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Northwestern University.
On September 15, 1999, &quot;American Beauty&quot; opened to the public in limited release at three theaters in Los Angeles and three in New York. More theaters were added during the limited run, and on October 1, the film officially entered wide release by screening in 706 theaters across North America. The film grossed $8,188,587 over the weekend, ranking third at the box office behind &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot; and &quot;Three Kings&quot;. Audiences polled by the market research firm CinemaScore gave &quot;American Beauty&quot; a &quot;B+&quot; grade on average. The theater count hit a high of 1,528 at the end of the month, before a gradual decline. Following &quot;American Beauty&quot;″s wins at the 57th Golden Globe Awards, DreamWorks re-expanded the theater presence from a low of 7 in mid-February, to a high of 1,990 in March. The film ended its North American theatrical run on June 4, 2000, having grossed $130.1 million.

&quot;American Beauty&quot; had its European premiere at the London Film Festival on November 18, 1999; in January 2000, it began to screen in various territories outside North America. It debuted in Israel to &quot;potent&quot; returns, and limited releases in Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Finland followed on January 21. After January 28 opening weekends in Australia, the United Kingdom, Spain and Norway, &quot;American Beauty&quot; had earned $7 million in 12 countries for a total of $12.1 million outside North America. On February 4, &quot;American Beauty&quot; debuted in France and Belgium. Expanding to 303 theaters in the United Kingdom, the film ranked first at the box office with $1.7 million. There, it surpassed &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; for scoring the highest opening weekend for an 18 certificate film. This record would be overtaken by &quot;Snatch&quot; later that year. On the weekend of February 18—following &quot;American Beauty&quot;″s eight nominations for the 72nd Academy Awards—the film grossed $11.7 million from 21 territories, for a total of $65.4 million outside North America. The film had &quot;dazzling&quot; debuts in Hungary, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and New Zealand.

As of February 18, the most successful territories were the United Kingdom ($15.2 million), Italy ($10.8 million), Germany ($10.5 million), Australia ($6 million), and France ($5.3 million). The Academy Award nominations meant strong performances continued across the board; the following weekend, &quot;American Beauty&quot; grossed $10.9 million in 27 countries, with strong debuts in Brazil, Mexico, and South Korea. Other high spots included robust returns in Argentina, Greece, and Turkey. On the weekend of March 3, 2000, &quot;American Beauty&quot; debuted strongly in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore, markets traditionally &quot;not receptive to this kind of upscale fare&quot;. The impressive South Korean performance continued, with a return of $1.2 million after nine days. In total, &quot;American Beauty&quot; grossed $130.1 million in North America and $226.2 million internationally, for $356.3 million worldwide.

===Home media===
&quot;American Beauty&quot; was released on VHS on May 9, 2000, and on DVD with the DTS format on October 24, 2000. Before the North American rental release on May 9, Blockbuster Video wanted to purchase hundreds of thousands of extra copies for its &quot;guaranteed title&quot; range, whereby anyone who wanted to rent the film would be guaranteed a copy. Blockbuster and DreamWorks could not agree on a profit-sharing deal, so Blockbuster ordered two-thirds the number of copies it originally intended. DreamWorks made around one million copies available for rental; Blockbuster&#x27;s share would usually have been about 400,000 of these. Some Blockbuster stores only displayed 60 copies, and others did not display the film at all, forcing customers to ask for it. The strategy required staff to read a statement to customers explaining the situation; Blockbuster claimed it was only &quot;[monitoring] customer demand&quot; due to the reduced availability. Blockbuster&#x27;s strategy leaked before May 9, leading to a 30 percent order increase from other retailers.

In its first week of rental release, &quot;American Beauty&quot; made $6.8 million. This return was lower than would have been expected had DreamWorks and Blockbuster reached an agreement. In the same year, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; made $22 million, while &quot;Fight Club&quot; made $8.1 million, though the latter&#x27;s North American theatrical performance was just 29 percent that of &quot;American Beauty&quot;. Blockbuster&#x27;s strategy also affected rental fees; &quot;American Beauty&quot; averaged $3.12, compared with $3.40 for films that Blockbuster fully promoted. Only 53 percent of the film&#x27;s rentals were from large outlets in the first week, compared with the usual 65 percent.

The DVD release included a behind-the-scenes featurette, film audio commentary from Mendes and Ball, and a storyboard presentation with discussion from Mendes and Hall. In the film commentary, Mendes refers to deleted scenes he intended to include in the release. However, these scenes are not on the DVD, as he changed his mind after recording the commentary; Mendes felt that to show scenes he previously chose not to use would detract from the film&#x27;s integrity.

On September 21, 2010, Paramount Home Entertainment released &quot;American Beauty&quot; on Blu-ray, as part of Paramount&#x27;s Sapphire Series. All the extras from the DVD release were present, with the theatrical trailers upgraded to HD.

==Reception and legacy==
===Initial===
&quot;American Beauty&quot; received overwhelming praise upon release, chiefly for Spacey, Mendes and Ball. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that &quot;no other 1999 movie has benefited from such universal raves.&quot; It was the best-received title at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), where it won the People&#x27;s Choice award after a ballot of the festival&#x27;s audiences. TIFF&#x27;s director, Piers Handling, said, &quot;&quot;American Beauty&quot; was the buzz of the festival, the film most talked-about.&quot;

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 87% of 190 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;Flawlessly cast and brimming with dark, acid wit, &quot;American Beauty&quot; is a smart, provocative high point of late &#x27;90s mainstream Hollywood film.&quot; According to Metacritic, which assigned a weighted average score of 84 out of 100 based on 34 critics, the film received &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, who awarded the film four out of four stars, singled Spacey out for successfully portraying a man who &quot;does reckless and foolish things [but who] doesn&#x27;t deceive himself&quot;. Kevin Jackson of &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; said Spacey impressed in ways distinct from his previous performances, the most satisfying aspect being his portrayal of &quot;both sap and hero&quot;.

===Retrospective===
A few months after the release of &quot;American Beauty&quot;, reports of a backlash appeared in the American press. In the years since the film&#x27;s release, its critical regard has waned. A significant factor was its themes being seen as trivial after the September 11 attacks and the Great Recession of late 2007 to 2009.

In 2005, &quot;Premiere&quot; named &quot;American Beauty&quot; as one of 20 &quot;most overrated movies of all time.&quot; Mendes accepted the inevitability of the critical reappraisal, saying in 2008, &quot;I thought some of it was entirely justified—it was a little overpraised at the time.&quot;

In 2017, allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against actor Kevin Spacey surfaced at the height of the MeToo movement, including by men who were underage at the time of the allegations. This led many critics and one of Spacey&#x27;s accusers, actor Anthony Rapp, to find uncomfortable parallels between Spacey and Lester Burnham, his character in &quot;American Beauty&quot;.

In 2019, on the twentieth anniversary of the film&#x27;s release, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;″s Matthew Jacobs wrote that &quot;the film&#x27;s reputation has tumbled precipitously,&quot; adding, &quot;Plenty of classics undergo cultural reappraisals [...] but few have turned into such a widespread punchline.&quot;

In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, critic Guy Lodge wrote &quot;the pushback against &quot;American Beauty&quot; in the intervening two decades has been swift and merciless – taking root well before Spacey&#x27;s personal and professional downfall, though that certainly hasn&#x27;t helped. Ask film critics of various ages about it now and you will tend to meet with a uniform sneer, along with a blanket dismissal of its cheap-shot picket-fence satire, its broad characterisation, its purportedly misogynistic view of career women, or its awestruck command of metaphor as flimsy and floaty as, well, a plastic bag dancing in the breeze.&quot; Lodge also stated, &quot;You might hear grudging acknowledgement of its formal artistry, including the satin tactility of the late Conrad L Hall&#x27;s cinematography, or the eerie, echo-y, endlessly imitated percussion of Thomas Newman&#x27;s once-ubiquitous score. But that, too, is tempered with dismissiveness toward its makers.&quot;

Similar to Matthew Jacobs&#x27;s assessment, Stephanie Zacharek for &quot;Time&quot; wrote, &quot;In 2019, beating up on Sam Mendes&#x27; multi-Oscar-winning &quot;American Beauty&quot; [...] is so painfully easy that it seems unfair. The Best Picture winner has fallen largely out of fashion; it rarely appears on critics&#x27; lists of favorite movies, and its memory seems to have faded for most moviegoers, too.&quot; Zacharek concluded, &quot;&quot;American Beauty&quot; is a movie about a privileged white guy who feels bad about himself and tries to rectify that by exploding his life—only to lose it all in the end. It&#x27;s about a man who thought he had control, but didn&#x27;t—and who can&#x27;t, at the very least, relate to that? In the context of his own crisis of self-absorption, Lester Burnham couldn&#x27;t see the real collision course looming ahead, a future of lost jobs and foreclosures, of madhouse doublespeak issuing from the mouths of people whose job it is to lead us, of wars that can&#x27;t be won and thus keep being fought. Maybe it takes a look back at a ridiculous movie to show us how much we&#x27;ve really lost. Whatever Ball&#x27;s &#x27;authentic life&#x27; really is, you can bet it&#x27;s not being lived on Instagram.&quot;

Nonetheless, other critics still defend the artistic value of the film. In 2014, on the occasion of the fifteenth anniversary of the movie, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&#x27;s&quot; Ashley Fetters stated that &quot;American Beauty&quot; stands as &quot;a classic, if not a masterpiece.&quot; Guy Lodge acknowledged the film&#x27;s flaws but admitted it still &quot;turns out to be an exquisitely presented time capsule, a snapshot of middle-class, notionally liberal white society entering a spasm of panic at the turn of both the century and the Clinton era. Its satire isn&#x27;t sophisticated, but it&#x27;s pointed, identifiable, and still often cuttingly funny, emblematic of a tone of withering pre-millennial snark that has since been earnestly outmoded, and not for the wittier. It was never intended as straightforward drama, but as garish suburban burlesque: a distorted funhouse mirror reflection of America already at its ugliest, with its performances and petal-strewn visuals expertly heightened to match.&quot; Lodge concluded, &quot;Twenty years on, &quot;American Beauty&quot; isn&#x27;t as clever as we thought it was, though it&#x27;s inadvertently aged into a kind of wounded, embattled wisdom. Perhaps it&#x27;s worth looking closer&quot;.

===In popular culture===
The film was spoofed by the animated sitcom &quot;Family Guy&quot;, the 2001 Todd Solondz film &quot;Storytelling&quot;, the teen movie spoof &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot;, the 2011 animated cartoon series &quot;The Amazing World of Gumball&quot; and in the 2005 DreamWorks animated film &quot;Madagascar&quot;.

==Accolades==

&quot;American Beauty&quot; was not considered an immediate favorite to dominate the American awards season. Several other contenders opened at the end of 1999, and US critics spread their honors among them when compiling their end-of-year lists. The Chicago Film Critics Association and the Broadcast Film Critics Association named the film the best of 1999, but while the New York Film Critics Circle, the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association recognized &quot;American Beauty&quot;, they gave their top awards to other films. By the end of the year, reports of a critical backlash suggested &quot;American Beauty&quot; was the underdog in the race for Best Picture; however, at the Golden Globe Awards in January 2000, &quot;American Beauty&quot; won Best Film, Best Director and Best Screenplay.

As the nominations for the 72nd Academy Awards approached, a frontrunner had not emerged. DreamWorks had launched a major campaign for &quot;American Beauty&quot; five weeks before ballots were due to be sent to the 5,600 Academy Award voters. Its campaign combined traditional advertising and publicity with more focused strategies. Although direct mail campaigning was prohibited, DreamWorks reached voters by promoting the film in &quot;casual, comfortable settings&quot; in voters&#x27; communities. The studio&#x27;s candidate for Best Picture the previous year, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, lost to &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, so the studio took a new approach by hiring outsiders to provide input for the campaign. It hired three veteran consultants, who told the studio to &quot;think small&quot;.

Nancy Willen encouraged DreamWorks to produce a special about the making of &quot;American Beauty&quot;, to set up displays of the film in the communities&#x27; bookstores, and to arrange a question-and-answer session with Mendes for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Dale Olson advised the studio to advertise in free publications that circulated in Beverly Hills—home to many voters—in addition to major newspapers. Olson arranged to screen &quot;American Beauty&quot; to about 1,000 members of the Actors Fund of America, as many participating actors were also voters. Bruce Feldman took writer Alan Ball to the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, where Ball attended a private dinner in honor of Anthony Hopkins, meeting several voters who were in attendance.

In February 2000, &quot;American Beauty&quot; was nominated for eight Academy Awards; its closest rivals, &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; and &quot;The Insider&quot;, received seven nominations each. In March 2000, the major industry labor organizations all awarded their top honors to &quot;American Beauty&quot;; perceptions had shifted—the film was now the favorite to dominate the Academy Awards. &quot;American Beauty&quot;″s closest rival for Best Picture was still &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot;, from Miramax. Both studios mounted aggressive campaigns; DreamWorks bought 38 percent more advertising space in &quot;Variety&quot; than Miramax. On March 26, 2000, &quot;American Beauty&quot; won five Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Spacey), Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography.

At the 53rd British Academy Film Awards, &quot;American Beauty&quot; won six of the 14 awards for which it was nominated: Best Film, Best Actor, Best Actress (Bening), Best Cinematography, Best Film Music and Best Editing.

In March 2000, the Publicists Guild of America recognized DreamWorks for the best film publicity campaign.

===MTV Movie Awards controversy===

In April 2000, controversy arose when the 2000 MTV Movie Awards initially nominated &quot;American Beauty&quot; for their annual award for Best Kiss between Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham and Mena Suvari as Angela Hayes. DreamWorks rejected MTV&#x27;s request for a clip, stating that they did not want to glorify the &quot;inappropriate&quot; kiss between the characters, a 42-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl. MTV rescinded the film&#x27;s nomination afterward.

===Retrospective accolades===

In 2006, the Writers Guild of America ranked the screenplay number 38 on its list of the 101 greatest screenplays.

<text>A gyroscope (from Ancient Greek γῦρος &quot;gŷros&quot;, &quot;round&quot; and σκοπέω &quot;skopéō&quot;, &quot;to look&quot;) is a device used for measuring or maintaining orientation and angular velocity. It is a spinning wheel or disc in which the axis of rotation (spin axis) is free to assume any orientation by itself. When rotating, the orientation of this axis is unaffected by tilting or rotation of the mounting, according to the conservation of angular momentum.

Gyroscopes based on other operating principles also exist, such as the microchip-packaged MEMS gyroscopes found in electronic devices (sometimes called gyrometers), solid-state ring lasers, fibre optic gyroscopes, and the extremely sensitive quantum gyroscope.

Applications of gyroscopes include inertial navigation systems, such as in the Hubble Space Telescope, or inside the steel hull of a submerged submarine. Due to their precision, gyroscopes are also used in gyrotheodolites to maintain direction in tunnel mining. Gyroscopes can be used to construct gyrocompasses, which complement or replace magnetic compasses (in ships, aircraft and spacecraft, vehicles in general), to assist in stability (bicycles, motorcycles, and ships) or be used as part of an inertial guidance system.

MEMS gyroscopes are popular in some consumer electronics, such as smartphones.

==Description and diagram==
A gyroscope is an instrument, consisting of a wheel mounted into two or three gimbals providing pivoted supports, for allowing the wheel to rotate about a single axis. A set of three gimbals, one mounted on the other with orthogonal pivot axes, may be used to allow a wheel mounted on the innermost gimbal to have an orientation remaining independent of the orientation, in space, of its support.

In the case of a gyroscope with two gimbals, the outer gimbal, which is the gyroscope frame, is mounted so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane determined by the support. This outer gimbal possesses one degree of rotational freedom and its axis possesses none. The second gimbal, inner gimbal, is mounted in the gyroscope frame (outer gimbal) so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane that is always perpendicular to the pivotal axis of the gyroscope frame (outer gimbal). This inner gimbal has two degrees of rotational freedom.

The axle of the spinning wheel (the rotor) defines the spin axis. The rotor is constrained to spin about an axis, which is always perpendicular to the axis of the inner gimbal. So the rotor possesses three degrees of rotational freedom and its axis possesses two.
The rotor responds to a force applied to the input axis by a reaction force to the output axis.

A gyroscope flywheel will roll or resist about the output axis depending upon whether the output gimbals are of a free or fixed configuration. An example of some free-output-gimbal devices is the attitude control gyroscopes used to sense or measure the pitch, roll and yaw attitude angles in a spacecraft or aircraft.

The centre of gravity of the rotor can be in a fixed position. The rotor simultaneously spins about one axis and is capable of oscillating about the two other axes, and it is free to turn in any direction about the fixed point (except for its inherent resistance caused by rotor spin). Some gyroscopes have mechanical equivalents substituted for one or more of the elements. For example, the spinning rotor may be suspended in a fluid, instead of being mounted in gimbals. A control moment gyroscope (CMG) is an example of a fixed-output-gimbal device that is used on spacecraft to hold or maintain a desired attitude angle or pointing direction using the gyroscopic resistance force.

In some special cases, the outer gimbal (or its equivalent) may be omitted so that the rotor has only two degrees of freedom. In other cases, the centre of gravity of the rotor may be offset from the axis of oscillation, and thus the centre of gravity of the rotor and the centre of suspension of the rotor may not coincide.

==History==
===Early similar devices===
Essentially, a gyroscope is a top combined with a pair of gimbals. Tops were invented in many different civilizations, including classical Greece, Rome, and China. Most of these were not utilized as instruments.

The first known apparatus similar to a gyroscope (the &quot;Whirling Speculum&quot; or &quot;Serson&#x27;s Speculum&quot;) was invented by John Serson in 1743. It was used as a level, to locate the horizon in foggy or misty conditions.

The first instrument used more like an actual gyroscope was made by Johann Bohnenberger of Germany, who first wrote about it in 1817. At first he called it the &quot;Machine&quot;. Bohnenberger&#x27;s machine was based on a rotating massive sphere. In 1832, American Walter R. Johnson developed a similar device that was based on a rotating disc. The French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace, working at the École Polytechnique in Paris, recommended the machine for use as a teaching aid, and thus it came to the attention of Léon Foucault.

===Foucault&#x27;s gyroscope===
In 1852, Foucault used it in an experiment demonstrating the rotation of the Earth.

It was Foucault who gave the device its modern name, in an experiment to see (Greek &quot;skopeein&quot;, to see) the Earth&#x27;s rotation (Greek &quot;gyros&quot;, circle or rotation), which was visible in the 8 to 10 minutes before friction slowed the spinning rotor.

===Commercialization===
In the 1860s, the advent of electric motors made it possible for a gyroscope to spin indefinitely; this led to the first prototype heading indicators, and a rather more complicated device, the gyrocompass. The first functional gyrocompass was patented in 1904 by German inventor Hermann Anschütz-Kaempfe. American Elmer Sperry followed with his own design later that year, and other nations soon realized the military importance of the invention—in an age in which naval prowess was the most significant measure of military power—and created their own gyroscope industries. The Sperry Gyroscope Company quickly expanded to provide aircraft and naval stabilizers as well, and other gyroscope developers followed suit.

Circa 1911 the L. T. Hurst Mfg Co of Indianapolis started producing the &quot;Hurst gyroscope&quot; a toy gyroscope with a pull string and pedestal. Manufacture was at some point switched to Chandler Mfg Co (still branded Hurst). The product was later renamed to a “Chandler gyroscope”, presumably because Chandler Mfg Co. took over rights to the gyroscope. Chandler continued to produce the toy until the company was purchased by TEDCO Inc. in 1982. The gyroscope is still produced by TEDCO today.

In the first several decades of the 20th century, other inventors attempted (unsuccessfully) to use gyroscopes as the basis for early black box navigational systems by creating a stable platform from which accurate acceleration measurements could be performed (in order to bypass the need for star sightings to calculate position). Similar principles were later employed in the development of inertial navigation systems for ballistic missiles.

During World War II, the gyroscope became the prime component for aircraft and anti-aircraft gun sights. After the war, the race to miniaturize gyroscopes for guided missiles and weapons navigation systems resulted in the development and manufacturing of so-called midget gyroscopes that weighed less than and had a diameter of approximately . Some of these miniaturized gyroscopes could reach a speed of 24,000 revolutions per minute in less than 10 seconds.

Gyroscopes continue to be an engineering challenge. For example, the axle bearings have to be extremely accurate. A small amount of friction is deliberately introduced to the bearings, since otherwise an accuracy of better than formula_1 of an inch (2.5 nm) would be required.

Three-axis MEMS-based gyroscopes are also used in portable electronic devices such as tablets, smartphones, and smartwatches. This adds to the 3-axis acceleration sensing ability available on previous generations of devices. Together these sensors provide 6 component motion sensing; accelerometers for X, Y, and Z movement, and gyroscopes for measuring the extent and rate of rotation in space (roll, pitch and yaw). Some devices additionally incorporate a magnetometer to provide absolute angular measurements relative to the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Newer MEMS-based inertial measurement units incorporate up to all nine axes of sensing in a single integrated circuit package, providing inexpensive and widely available motion sensing.

== Gyroscopic principles ==
All spinning objects have gyroscopic properties. The main properties that an object can experience in any gyroscopic motion are rigidity in space and precession.

=== Rigidity in space ===

Rigidity in space describes the principle that a gyroscope remains in the fixed position on the plane in which it is spinning, unaffected by the Earth&#x27;s rotation. For example, a bike wheel. Early forms of gyroscope (not then known by the name) were used to demonstrate the principle.

===Precession===

A simple case of precession, also known as steady precession, can be described by the following relation to Moment:

:formula_2

where formula_3 represents precession, formula_4 is represented by spin, formula_5 is the nutation angle, and formula_6 represents inertia along its respective axis. This relation is only valid with the Moment along the Y and Z axes are equal to 0.

The equation can be further reduced noting that the angular velocity along the z-axis is equal to the sum of the Precession and the Spin: formula_7, Where formula_8 represents the angular velocity along the z axis.

:formula_9

or

:formula_10

Gyroscopic precession is torque induced. It is the rate of change of the angular momentum that is produced by the applied torque. Precession produces counterintuitive dynamic results such as a spinning top not falling over. Precession is used in aerospace applications for sensing changes of attitude and direction.

==Contemporary uses==
===Steadicam===

A Steadicam rig was employed during the filming of the 1983 film &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, in conjunction with two gyroscopes for extra stabilization, to film the background plates for the speeder bike chase. Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown operated the shot, walking through a redwood forest, running the camera at one frame per second. When projected at 24 frames per second, it gave the impression of flying through the air at perilous speeds.

===Heading indicator===

The heading indicator or directional gyro has an axis of rotation that is set horizontally, pointing north. Unlike a magnetic compass, it does not seek north. When being used in an airplane, for example, it will slowly drift away from north and will need to be reoriented periodically, using a magnetic compass as a reference.

===Gyrocompass===

Unlike a directional gyro or heading indicator, a gyrocompass seeks north. It detects the rotation of the Earth about its axis and seeks the &quot;true&quot; north, rather than the &quot;magnetic&quot; north. Gyrocompasses usually have built-in damping to prevent overshoot when re-calibrating from sudden movement.

===Accelerometer===

By determining an object&#x27;s acceleration and integrating over time, the velocity of the object can be calculated. Integrating again, position can be determined. The simplest accelerometer is a weight that is free to move horizontally, which is attached to a spring and a device to measure the tension in the spring. This can be improved by introducing a counteracting force to push the weight back and to measure the force needed to prevent the weight from moving. A more complicated design consists of a gyroscope with a weight on one of the axes. The device will react to the force generated by the weight when it is accelerated, by integrating that force to produce a velocity.

==Variations==

===Gyrostat===

A gyrostat consists of a massive flywheel concealed in a solid casing. Its behaviour on a table, or with various modes of suspension or support, serves to illustrate the curious reversal of the ordinary laws of static equilibrium due to the gyrostatic behaviour of the interior invisible flywheel when rotated rapidly. The first gyrostat was designed by Lord Kelvin to illustrate the more complicated state of motion of a spinning body when free to wander about on a horizontal plane, like a top spun on the pavement, or a bicycle on the road. Kelvin also made use of gyrostats to develop mechanical theories of the elasticity of matter and of the ether. In modern continuum mechanics there is a variety of these models, based on ideas of Lord Kelvin. They represent a specific type of Cosserat theories (suggested for the first time by Eugène Cosserat and François Cosserat), which can be used for description of artificially made smart materials as well as of other complex media. One of them, so-called Kelvin&#x27;s medium, has the same equations as magnetic insulators near the state of magnetic saturation in the approximation of quasimagnetostatics.

In modern times, the gyrostat concept is used in the design of attitude control systems for orbiting spacecraft and satellites. For instance, the Mir space station had three pairs of internally mounted flywheels known as &quot;gyrodynes&quot; or control moment gyroscopes.

In physics, there are several systems whose dynamical equations resemble the equations of motion of a gyrostat. Examples include a solid body with a cavity filled with an inviscid, incompressible, homogeneous liquid, the static equilibrium configuration of a stressed elastic rod in elastica theory, the polarization dynamics of a light pulse propagating through a nonlinear medium, the Lorenz system in chaos theory, and the motion of an ion in a Penning trap mass spectrometer.

=== MEMS gyroscope ===
A microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscope is a miniaturized gyroscope found in electronic devices. It takes the idea of the Foucault pendulum and uses a vibrating element. This kind of gyroscope was first used in military applications but has since been adopted for increasing commercial use.

=== HRG ===

The hemispherical resonator gyroscope (HRG), also called a wine-glass gyroscope or mushroom gyro, makes use of a thin solid-state hemispherical shell, anchored by a thick stem. This shell is driven to a flexural resonance by electrostatic forces generated by electrodes which are deposited directly onto separate fused-quartz structures that surround the shell. Gyroscopic effect is obtained from the inertial property of the flexural standing waves.

=== VSG or CVG ===

A vibrating structure gyroscope (VSG), also called a Coriolis vibratory gyroscope (CVG), uses a resonator made of different metallic alloys. It takes a position between the low-accuracy, low-cost MEMS gyroscope and the higher-accuracy and higher-cost fiber optic gyroscope. Accuracy parameters are increased by using low-intrinsic damping materials, resonator vacuumization, and digital electronics to reduce temperature dependent drift and instability of control signals.

High quality wine-glass resonators are used for precise sensors like HRG.

=== DTG ===
A dynamically tuned gyroscope (DTG) is a rotor suspended by a universal joint with flexure pivots. The flexure spring stiffness is independent of spin rate. However, the dynamic inertia (from the gyroscopic reaction effect) from the gimbal provides negative spring stiffness proportional to the square of the spin speed (Howe and Savet, 1964; Lawrence, 1998). Therefore, at a particular speed, called the tuning speed, the two moments cancel each other, freeing the rotor from torque, a necessary condition for an ideal gyroscope.

===Ring laser gyroscope===

A ring laser gyroscope relies on the Sagnac effect to measure rotation by measuring the shifting interference pattern of a beam split into two separate beams which travel around the ring in opposite directions.

When the Boeing 757-200 entered service in 1983, it was equipped with the first suitable ring laser gyroscope. This gyroscope took many years to develop, and the experimental models went through many changes before it was deemed ready for production by the engineers and managers of Honeywell and Boeing. It was an outcome of the competition with mechanical gyroscopes, which kept improving. The reason Honeywell, of all companies, chose to develop the laser gyro was that they were the only one that didn&#x27;t have a successful line of mechanical gyroscopes, so they wouldn&#x27;t be competing against themselves. The first problem they had to solve was that with laser gyros rotations below a certain minimum could not be detected at all, due to a problem called &quot;lock-in&quot;, whereby the two beams act like coupled oscillators and pull each other&#x27;s frequencies toward convergence and therefore zero output. The solution was to shake the gyro rapidly so that it never settled into lock-in. Paradoxically, too regular of a dithering motion produced an accumulation of short periods of lock-in when the device was at rest at the extremities of its shaking motion. This was cured by applying a random white noise to the vibration. The material of the block was also changed from quartz to a new glass ceramic Cer-Vit, made by Owens Corning, because of helium leaks.

=== Fiber optic gyroscope ===

A fiber optic gyroscope also uses the interference of light to detect mechanical rotation. The two-halves of the split beam travel in opposite directions in a coil of fiber optic cable as long as 5 km. Like the ring laser gyroscope, it makes use of the Sagnac effect.

=== London moment ===
A London moment gyroscope relies on the quantum-mechanical phenomenon, whereby a spinning superconductor generates a magnetic field whose axis lines up exactly with the spin axis of the gyroscopic rotor. A magnetometer determines the orientation of the generated field, which is interpolated to determine the axis of rotation. Gyroscopes of this type can be extremely accurate and stable. For example, those used in the Gravity Probe B experiment measured changes in gyroscope spin axis orientation to better than 0.5 milliarcseconds (1.4 degrees, or about ) over a one-year period. This is equivalent to an angular separation the width of a human hair viewed from away.

The GP-B gyro consists of a nearly-perfect spherical rotating mass made of fused quartz, which provides a dielectric support for a thin layer of niobium superconducting material. To eliminate friction found in conventional bearings, the rotor assembly is centered by the electric field from six electrodes. After the initial spin-up by a jet of helium which brings the rotor to 4,000 RPM, the polished gyroscope housing is evacuated to an ultra-high vacuum to further reduce drag on the rotor. Provided the suspension electronics remain powered, the extreme rotational symmetry, lack of friction, and low drag will allow the angular momentum of the rotor to keep it spinning for about 15,000 years.

A sensitive DC SQUID that can discriminate changes as small as one quantum, or about 2 Wb, is used to monitor the gyroscope. A precession, or tilt, in the orientation of the rotor causes the London moment magnetic field to shift relative to the housing. The moving field passes through a superconducting pickup loop fixed to the housing, inducing a small electric current. The current produces a voltage across a shunt resistance, which is resolved to spherical coordinates by a microprocessor. The system is designed to minimize Lorentz torque on the rotor.

== Other examples ==
=== Helicopters ===

The main rotor of a helicopter acts like a gyroscope. Its motion is influenced by the principle of gyroscopic precession which is the concept that a force applied to a spinning object will have a maximum reaction approximately 90 degrees later. The reaction may differ from 90 degrees when other stronger forces are in play. To change direction, helicopters must adjust the pitch angle and the angle of attack.

===Gyro X===
Gyro X prototype vehicle created by Alex Tremulis and Thomas Summers in 1967. The car utilized gyroscopic precession to drive on two wheels. An assembly consisting of a flywheel mounted in a gimbal housing under the hood of the vehicle acted as a large gyroscope. The flywheel was rotated by hydraulic pumps creating a gyroscopic effect on the vehicle. A precessional ram was responsible for rotating the gyroscope to change the direction of the precessional force to counteract any forces causing the vehicle imbalance. The one-of-a-kind prototype is now at the Lane Motor Museum in Nashville, Tennessee.

==Consumer electronics==
In addition to being used in compasses, aircraft, computer pointing devices, etc., gyroscopes have been introduced into consumer electronics.

Since the gyroscope allows the calculation of orientation and rotation, designers have incorporated them into modern technology. The integration of the gyroscope has allowed for more accurate recognition of movement within a 3D space than the previous lone accelerometer within a number of smartphones. Gyroscopes in consumer electronics are frequently combined with accelerometers for more robust direction- and motion-sensing. Examples of such applications include smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, HTC Titan, Nexus 5, iPhone 5s, Nokia 808 PureView and Sony Xperia, game console peripherals such as the PlayStation 3 controller and the Wii Remote, and virtual reality headsets such as the Oculus Rift. Some features of Android phones like PhotoSphere or 360 Camera and to use VR gadget do not work without a gyroscope sensor in the phone.

Nintendo has integrated a gyroscope into the Wii console&#x27;s Wii Remote controller by an additional piece of hardware called &quot;Wii MotionPlus&quot;. It is also included in the 3DS, Wii U GamePad, and Nintendo Switch Joy-Con and Pro controllers, which detect movement when turning and shaking.

Cruise ships use gyroscopes to level motion-sensitive devices such as self-leveling pool tables.

An electric powered flywheel gyroscope inserted in a bicycle wheel is sold as an alternative to training wheels.

<text>Military incompetence refers to incompetencies and failures of military organisations, whether through incompetent individuals or through a flawed institutional culture.

The effects of isolated cases of &quot;personal&quot; incompetence can be disproportionately significant in military organisations. Strict hierarchies of command provide the opportunity for a single decision to direct the work of thousands, whilst an institutional culture devoted to following orders without debate can help ensure that a bad or miscommunicated decision is implemented without being challenged or corrected.

However, the most common cases of &quot;military incompetence&quot; can be attributable to a flawed organisational culture. Perhaps the most marked of these is a conservative and traditionalist attitude, where innovative ideas or new technology are discarded or left untested. A tendency to believe that a problem can be solved by applying an earlier (failed) solution &quot;better&quot;, be that with more men, more firepower, or simply more zeal, is common. A strict hierarchical system often discourages the devolution of power to junior commanders, and can encourage micromanagement by senior officers.

The nature of warfare provides several factors which exacerbate these effects; the fog of war means that information about the enemy forces is often limited or inaccurate, making it easy for the intelligence process to interpret the information to agree with existing assumptions, or to fit it to their own preconceptions and expectations. Communications tend to deteriorate in battlefield situations, with the flow of information between commanders and combat units being disrupted, making it difficult to react to changes in the situation as they develop.

After operations have ceased, military organisations often fail to learn effectively from experience. In victory, whatever methods have been usedno matter how inefficientappear to have been vindicated (see victory disease), whilst in defeat there is a tendency to select scapegoats and to avoid looking in detail at the broader reasons for failure.

<text>A lashing is an arrangement of rope, wire, or webbing with linking device used to secure and fasten two or more items together in a somewhat rigid manner. Lashings are most commonly applied to timber poles, and are commonly associated with cargo, containerisation, the Scouting movement, sailors, and gardeners.

It has been imagined that the first lashing made by humans was wrapping a few strips of bark around a stone to hold it to a tree branch to make an ax to hunt and build with. In modern times, the same methods are used, but strips of bark and vines have been replaced with natural and synthetic fiber ropes. Scouts and campers use lashings to build camp gadgets and improve their campsites for comfort and convenience, including the building of rafts for transport and competitive events. Lashings are also used in pioneering, the art of creating structures such as bridges and towers, using ropes and wooden spars.

There are still areas in the world where lashing spars (or poles) is the basic means of building.

==Types==

===Square lashing===

Square lashing is a type of lashing used to bind spars together, at right angles to one another. There are different types, but all consist of a series of wraps around the spars, and frapping around the line running between the spars.

===Diagonal lashing===

Diagonal lashing is a type of lashing used to bind spars or poles together, to prevent racking. It gets its name from the fact that the wrapping turns cross the poles diagonally and is used to spring poles together where they do not touch as in the X-brace of a trestle.

===Shear lashing===

Shear lashing (two-spar shear lashing) also spelled &quot;sheer lashing&quot; is used for lashing together two parallel spars which will be opened out of the parallel to form sheer legs as in the formation of an A-frame. The clove hitch is tied around one leg only and frapping turns are taken between the poles.

===Round lashing ===

The round lashing is most frequently used to join two poles together to extend their length. Typically, two lashings are used a reasonable distance apart for extra strength. In the simple version, a clove hitch is tied around both poles and there are no frapping turns.

The nautical term gammon means a round lashing of rope or iron hardware to attach a mast to a boat or ship.

===Tripod lashing===

The tripod lashing (also known as gyn lashing, figure of eight lashing, and three-spar shear lashing) is used to join several spars together to form a self supporting structure. If the lashing is tied around three spars, then the structure is called a tripod, but quadpods can also be made by using four spars.

<text>Ramallah ( , ; ) is a Palestinian city in the central West Bank, that serves as the &quot;de facto&quot; administrative capital of the State of Palestine. It is situated on the Judaean Mountains, north of Jerusalem, at an average elevation of above sea level, adjacent to al-Bireh.

Ramallah has buildings containing masonry from the period of Herod the Great, but no complete building predates the Crusades of the 11th century. The modern city was founded during the 16th century by the Hadadeens, an Arab Christian clan descended from Ghassanids. In 1517, the city was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, and in 1920, it became part of British Mandatory Palestine after it was captured by the United Kingdom during World War I. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Ramallah, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Ramallah was later captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Since the 1995 Oslo Accords, Ramallah has been governed by the PNA (Palestinian National Authority) as part of Area A of the West Bank.

In recent years, Ramallah has emerged as a key political, cultural, and economic center. It houses various Palestinian governmental bodies, including the Mukataa, the official residence of the President of the Palestinian National Authority, the Palestinian Legislative Council, and the headquarters of the Palestinian Security Services. It is also home to several museums and cultural centers, and has a notable nightlife scene. While historically a predominantly Christian town, Muslims constituted a majority of Ramallah&#x27;s 38,998 residents by 2017, with Christians making up a significant minority.

==History==
===Early history===
Ramallah was founded in the 16th century by the &quot;Hadadeens&quot;, an Arab Christian clan. The city boasts archaeological remnants from earlier epochs. Ancient rock-cut tombs have been found near Ramallah. Located just south of the built-up area is Tell en-Nasbeh, an archeological site where biblical Mizpah in Benjamin is likely to have been located.

Several Ramallah buildings incorporate masonry dating back to the reign of Herod the Great (37–4 BCE). Potsherds from the Crusader/Ayyubid and early Ottoman period have also been found there. Ramallah has been identified with the Crusader place called &quot;Ramalie&quot;. Remains of a building with an arched doorway from the Crusader era, called &quot;al-Burj&quot;, have been identified, but the original use of the building is undetermined.

===Ottoman period===
The area of Ramallah was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine. Modern Ramallah was founded in the mid-1500s by the Haddadins (also: Haddad&quot;ee&quot;n), a clan of brothers descended from Ghassanid Christians. The Haddadins (ancestors of the present-day Jadallah family, among others), and their leader Rashid el-Haddadin, arrived from east of the Jordan River from the areas of Karak and Shoubak. The Haddadin migration is attributed to fighting and unrest among clans in that area.

Haddadin was attracted to the mountainous site of Ramallah because it was similar to the mountainous areas he came from. In addition, the heavily forested area could supply him with plenty of fuel for his forges. In 1596, Ramallah was listed in the tax registers as being in the &quot;nahiya&quot; of Quds (Jerusalem), part of the &quot;Liwa of Quds&quot;. It had a population of 71 Christian households and 9 Muslim households. It paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on wheat, barley, olives, vines or fruit trees, and goats or beehives; a total of 9,400 akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf.

In 1838, American biblical scholar Edward Robinson visited the area, noting that the inhabitants were Christian &quot;of the Greek rite&quot;. There were 200 taxable men, which gives an estimated total population of 800–900 people. The village &quot;belonged&quot; to the Haram al-Sharif, Jerusalem, to which it paid an annual tax of 350 Mids of grain. In 1883, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described Ramallah as

A large Christian village, of well-built stone houses, standing on a high ridge, with a view on the west extending to the sea. It stands amongst gardens and olive-yards, and has three springs to the south and one on the west; on the north there are three more, within a mile from the village. On the east there is a well. There are rock-cut tombs to the north-east with well-cut entrances, but completely blocked with rubbish. In the village is a Greek church, and on the east a Latin convent and a Protestant schoolhouse, all modern buildings. The village lands are Wakuf, or ecclesiastical property, belonging to the Haram of Jerusalem. About a quarter of the inhabitants are Roman Catholics, the rest Orthodox Greeks.Ramallah was declared a modern city in 1908. It had an elected municipality as well as partnership projects with the adjacent town of al-Bireh. The Friends Boys School became a temporary hospital during World War I.

=== Christian presence, 17th–21st century ===
Ramallah grew dramatically throughout the 17th and 18th centuries as an agricultural village, attracting more (predominantly Christian) inhabitants from all around the region. In 1700, Yacoub Elias was the first Ramallah native to be ordained by the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, the Christian denomination that prevailed in the Holy Land at the time. In the early 19th century, the first Jerusalemite Greek Orthodox Christian church was built. Later, in 1852, the Greek Orthodox Church of the Transfiguration, was built to replace it; it is the sole Eastern Orthodox Church in Ramallah today.

There is also a Melkite Greek Catholic Church in Ramallah, built in 1895. The Roman Catholic Church also established its presence in Ramallah the 19th century and constitutes today the second-largest Christian denomination in the city. The Roman Catholic Church established the St. Joseph&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School run by St. Joseph sisters, as well as the co-educational Al-Ahliyyah College high school run by Rosary sisters. In 1913, construction of the Catholic Holy Family Church was started.

, Ramallah also has a Coptic Orthodox Church, an Evangelical Lutheran Church and an Episcopalian (Anglican) Church. In the 19th century, the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) established a presence in Ramallah and built the Ramallah Friends Schools, one for girls and later a boys&#x27; school, to alleviate the dearth of education for women and girls. Eli and Sybil Jones opened &quot;The Girls Training Home of Ramallah&quot; in 1869. A medical clinic was established in 1883, with Dr. George Hassenauer serving as the first doctor in Ramallah. In 1889, the girls academy became the Friends Girls School (FGS). As the FGS was also a boarding school, it attracted a number of girls from surrounding communities, including Jerusalem, Lydda, Jaffa, and Beirut. The Friends Boys School (FBS) was founded in 1901 and opened in 1918. The Quakers opened a Friends Meeting House for worship in the city center in 1910. According to the school&#x27;s official website, most high school students choose to take the International Baccalaureate exams (IBE) instead of the traditional &quot;Tawjihi&quot; university exams.

The activity of foreign churches in Palestine in the late 19th century increased awareness of prosperity in the West. In Ramallah and Bethlehem, a few miles south, local residents began to seek economic opportunity overseas. In 1901, merchants from Ramallah emigrated to the United States and established import-export businesses, selling handmade rugs and other exotic wares across the Atlantic. Increased trade dramatically improved living standards for Ramallah&#x27;s inhabitants. American cars, mechanized farming equipment, radios, and later televisions became attainable luxuries for upper-class families. As residents of Jaffa and Lydda moved to Ramallah, the balance of Muslims and Christians began to change.

In the 21st century, a large community of people with direct descent from the Haddadins who founded Ramallah live in the United States. The town is now predominately Muslim, but still contains a Christian minority. The change in demographics is due mostly to new migration of Muslims to the area, and emigration of Christians from the area.

=== British Mandate ===
During World War I, the British Army captured and occupied Ramallah in December 1917. The city remained occupied until the designation of the Palestine Mandate in 1920, resulting in Ramallah falling under British Mandatory control until 1948. In the 1920s, the economy of Ramallah started to improve, resulting in the local Arab upper class (consisting primarily of landowners and merchants) ordering the construction of several multi-storied villas, many of which still stand today. In 1939, the Jerusalem Electric Company introduced electricity to Ramallah, and a majority of the city&#x27;s homes became wired shortly thereafter. On the same year, the British Mandatory authorities inaugurated the state-owned Palestine Broadcasting Service in Ramallah, with BBC members training local radio staff to deliver daily broadcasts in Arabic, Hebrew, and English. The station was later renamed Jerusalem Calling.

In 1936, an Arab revolt against the British Mandate broke out in Palestine, and Ramallah soon became a center of insurgent activity. The rebels subsequently established a court near Ramallah, in order to provide legal alternatives to the courts of the British Mandate. One British schoolteacher noted that the Ramallah court judge began to produce &quot;news sheets on typewriters and duplicators, aimed at publicizing the alternative rebel regime.&quot;

===Jordanian and Israeli occupation: 1948—1993===
Following the creation of the State of Israel and the ensuing conflict, Jordan seized the part of Palestine they named the West Bank. This included Ramallah. The West Bank was relatively peaceful during the years of Jordanian rule between 1948 and 1967, with its residents enjoying freedom of movement between the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. Jordan annexed the West Bank, applying its national law to the conquered territory. However, many Palestinians were jailed for being members of &quot;illegal political parties&quot;, which included the Palestine Communist Party and other socialist and pro-independence groups. By 1953, Ramallah&#x27;s population had doubled, but the economy and infrastructure could not accommodate the influx of poor villagers. Natives of Ramallah began to emigrate, primarily to the United States. By 1956, about one fourth of Ramallah&#x27;s 6,000 natives had left, with Arabs from the surrounding towns and villages (particularly Hebron) buying the homes and land the émigrés left behind.

During the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel captured Ramallah from Jordan, imposing a military closure and conducting a census a few weeks later. Every person registered in the census was given an Israeli identity card which allowed the bearer to continue to reside there. Those who were abroad during the census lost their residency rights. For residents of Ramallah, the situation had now been reversed. For the first time in 19 years, residents could freely visit Israel and the Gaza Strip and engage in commerce there.

Unlike the Jordanians, Israel did not offer citizenship to the residents. Ramallah residents were issued permits to work in Israel, but did not gain the rights associated with Israeli citizenship. The city remained under Israeli military rule for more than four decades. The Israeli Civil Administration (CA), established in 1981, was in charge of civilian and day-to-day services such as issuing permission to travel, build, export or import, and host relatives from abroad. The CA reprinted Jordanian textbooks for distribution in schools but did not update them. The CA was in charge of tax collection and land expropriation, which sometimes included Israeli seizure of olive groves that Arab villagers had tended for generations.

According to the Israeli Human Rights activists, the development of Jewish settlements in the Ramallah area, such as Beit El and Psagot, prevented the expansion of the city and cut it off from the surrounding Arab villages. As resistance increased, Ramallah residents who were members of the Palestine Liberation Organization were jailed or deported to neighboring countries. In December 1987, the popular uprising known as the Intifada erupted, protesting against the continued Israeli occupation.

Ramallah residents were among the early joiners of the First Intifada. The Intifada Unified Leadership, an umbrella organization of various Palestinian factions, distributed weekly bulletins on the streets of Ramallah with a schedule of the daily protests, strikes and action against Israeli patrols in the city. At the demonstrations, tires were burned in the street, and the crowds threw stones and Molotov cocktails. The IDF responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. Schools in Ramallah were forcibly shut down, and opened gradually for a few hours a day. The Israelis conducted house arrests, imposing curfews that restricted travel and exports in what Palestinians regarded as collective punishment. In response to the closure of schools, residents organized home schooling sessions to help students make up missed material; this became one of the few symbols of civil disobedience. The Intifada leadership organized &quot;tree plantings&quot; and resorted to the tactics used in pre-1948 Palestine, such as ordering general strikes in which no commercial businesses were allowed to open and no cars were allowed on the streets.

In 1991, the Palestinian delegation to the Madrid International Peace Conference included many notables from Ramallah. As the Intifada wound down and the peace process moved forward, normal life in Ramallah resumed. On September 13, 1993, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat shook hands at a meeting at the White House. Schoolchildren in Ramallah handed out olive branches to Israeli soldiers patrolling the streets. In December 1995, in keeping with the Oslo Accords, the Israeli army abandoned the Mukataa and withdrew to the city outskirts. The newly established Palestinian Authority assumed civilian and security responsibility for the city, which was designated &quot;Area A&quot; under the accords.

===Palestinian Authority rule===
The years between 1993 and 2000 (known locally as the &quot;Oslo Years&quot;) brought relative prosperity to Ramallah. Ramallah and its immediate environs were classified as Area A in the Oslo Accords, under full civil and security control of the Palestinian Authority (PA) administration in September 1995. Many expatriates returned to establish businesses there, and the atmosphere was one of optimism. In 2000, unemployment began to rise and the economy of Ramallah declined. The Israel Defense Forces remained in control of the territories and its government did not restore the freedom of movement enjoyed by Ramallah residents prior to the first Intifada. Travel to Jerusalem required special permits. The number and size of Israeli settlements around Ramallah increased dramatically. A network of bypass roads for use of Israeli citizens only was built around Ramallah, and Israel expropriated land for settlements. Many official documents previously handled by the Israeli Civil Administration were now handled by the Palestinian Authority but still required Israeli approval. A Palestinian passport issued to Ramallah residents was not valid unless the serial number was registered with the Israeli authorities, who controlled border crossings.The failure of the Camp David summit in July 2000 led to the outbreak of the Second Intifada (al-Aqsa Intifada) in September 2000. Young Ramallah residents demonstrated daily against the Israeli army, with marches to the Israeli checkpoints at the outskirts of the city. Over time, the marches were replaced by sporadic use of live ammunition against Israeli soldiers; and various attacks targeting Jewish settlers, particularly on the Israeli-only bypass roads. Army checkpoints were established to restrict movement in and out of Ramallah. On October 12, 2000, two Israeli army reservists, Vadim Norzhich and Yosef Avrahami were lynched in Ramallah. They had taken a wrong turn, and were set upon by a mob, enraged in particular by the Muhammad al-Durrah incident in Gaza. A frenzied crowd killed the two IDF reservists, mutilated their bodies, and dragged them through the streets. Later that afternoon, the Israeli army carried out an air strike on Ramallah, demolishing the police station. Israel later succeeded in capturing and prosecuting some of those involved in the deaths of the reservists.The IDF has occasionally operated inside Ramallah, in breach of the 1995 Oslo Accords. The first and largest incursion was the 2002 Operation Defensive Shield, with a more recent intervention coming in March 2017 while attempting to arrest a suspected terrorist. In 2002, the army imposed curfews, electricity cuts, school closures and disruptions of commercial life. Many Ramallah institutions, including government ministries, were vandalized, and equipment was destroyed or stolen. The IDF took over local Ramallah television stations, and social and economic conditions deteriorated. Many expatriates left, as did many other Palestinians who complained that the living conditions had become intolerable. Construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier has added to Ramallah&#x27;s isolation. Yasser Arafat established his West Bank headquarters, the Mukataa, in Ramallah. Although considered an interim solution, Ramallah became the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the Palestinian Authority, now officially known as the State of Palestine. It hosts almost all governmental headquarters. In December 2001, Arafat held meetings at the Mukataa, but lived with his wife and daughter in Gaza City. After suicide bombings in Haifa, Arafat was confined to the Ramallah compound. In 2002, the compound was partly demolished by the Israeli Defense Forces and Arafat&#x27;s building was cut off from the rest of the compound.

On November 11, 2004, Arafat died at the Percy training hospital of the Armies near Paris. He was buried in the courtyard of the Mukataa on November 12, 2004. The site still serves as the Ramallah headquarters of the Palestinian Authority, as well the official West Bank office of Mahmoud Abbas. Throughout 2005, while the Disengagement Plan was underway, some US government officials suggested to the Palestinian leadership to move the provisional capital back to Gaza, where it had been when the Palestinian Authority was first established in 1994. President Abbas, however, refrained from doing so, arguing that at this point, it was important to keep the administrative center in the West Bank in order to remind the international community that the West Bank was still awaiting a territorial solution.

In December 2005, local elections were held in Ramallah in which candidates from three different factions competed for the 15-seat municipal council for a four-year term. The council elected Janet Mikhail as mayor, the first woman to hold the post.

Munir Hamdan, a member of Fatah and a Ramallah businessman, discussed the concentration of government offices with a journalist. He said, &quot;The president and prime minister have their offices here. So do the parliament and all the government ministries&quot;, representing a &quot;collusion&quot; between the Palestinian Authority and Israel to turn Ramallah into the political as well as the financial capital of the Palestinians. He is particularly worried by the construction of a large new governmental complex by the PA. Hatem Abdel Kader, a Jerusalem resident, Fatah legislator and former Minister for Jerusalem Affairs, complained that &quot;If they are building a new government compound here, that means they have no plans to be based in Jerusalem... Unfortunately, the Palestinian government of Salam Fayyad has abandoned Jerusalem in favor of Ramallah.&quot; In November 2011, King Abdullah II of Jordan visited Ramallah for the first time since 2000.

==Geography and climate==
This area enjoys a Mediterranean climate of a dry summer and mild, rainy winter with occasional snowfall. The recorded average of Ramallah&#x27;s rainfall is about and minimum rainfall is and maximum rainfall is .

The Köppen climate classification places Ramallah in the Csa category. Climates of this class generally occur on the western sides of continents between the latitudes of 30° and 45°. These climates are in the polar front region in winter, and thus have moderate temperatures and changeable, rainy weather. Summers are hot and dry, due to the domination of the subtropical high pressure systems, except in the immediate coastal areas, where summers are milder due to the nearby presence of cold ocean currents that may bring fog but prevent rain.

== Economy ==
Ramallah is chief financial and commercial center for the Palestinian Authority, home to the country&#x27;s numerous financial institutions. Currently Ramallah is seat of power of the Palestinian Authority, whose most of the offices are located within the city. The city serves as the headquarters for most international NGOs and embassies. Hundreds of millions of dollars in aid flowing into the city have boosted Ramallah&#x27;s economy greatly since the end of the Second Intifada. Ramallah&#x27;s buoyant economy continues to draw Palestinians from other West Bank towns where jobs are fewer. The built-up area has grown fivefold since 2002.

Construction boom is one of the most obvious signs of West Bank economic growth, estimated at an annual rate of 8 percent. This has been attributed to relative stability and Western donor support to the Palestinian Authority. The PIF have begun work on a $400 million commercial center comprising 13 towers which will be some of the tallest in Ramallah. The Ersal Commercial Center has drawn investment from a Saudi Arabian firm, The Land Holding, which has a 10% stake. It is not the only Gulf Arab firm investing in Ramallah and its outskirts. The Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company has a stake in Rawabi, a completely new town being constructed in the hills outside Ramallah at a cost of $1 billion.

Ramallah has highest concentration of high-tech companies. ASAL technologies, an information technology company in Ramallah, has 120 employees and is looking forward to &quot;exponential growth&quot;. In collaboration with the Republic of India, a new tech park named, the India Palestine Techno Park is located in Birzeit. Apple Inc operates a research &amp; development center in Rawabi with ASAL Technologies. A large number multinational companies operates facilities in Ramallah, which outsource Palestinians.

By 2010, Ramallah had become the leading center of economic and political activity in the territories under the control of the Palestinian Authority. During a building boom in the early years of the 21st century, apartment buildings and &quot;five-star&quot; hotels were erected, particularly in the Al-Masyoun neighborhood. In 2010, &quot;more than one hundred&quot; Palestinian businesses were reported to have moved to Ramallah from East Jerusalem, because &quot;Here they pay less taxes and have more customers.&quot; One local boasted to a journalist that &quot;Ramallah is becoming the de facto capital of Palestine.&quot; This boast was seconded by &quot;The New York Times&quot; which, in 2010, called Ramallah the &quot;de facto capital of the West Bank. According to Sani Meo, the publisher of &quot;This Week in Palestine&quot;, &quot;Capital or no capital, Ramallah has done well and Palestine is proud of its achievements.&quot; Some Palestinians allege that Ramallah&#x27;s prosperity is part of an Israeli &quot;conspiracy&quot; to make Ramallah the capital of a Palestinian state, instead of Jerusalem.

==Demographics==
An Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed that Ramallah had 249 houses and a population of 635, though the population count included men only. The village was described as being in the &quot;Bire&quot; area,&quot;north of Mikhmas, on a rocky hill.&quot; In 1896, the population of Ramallah was estimated to be about 2,061 persons.

In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Ramallah had a population of 3,104 (2,972 Christians, 125 Muslims, and seven Jews), the Christians consisting of 2,162 Orthodox, 1 Syriac Orthodox (Jacobite), 332 Roman Catholics, 144 Greek Catholic (Melkite Catholic), 211 Church of England, and 122 &quot;other&quot;. The population increased at the time of the 1931 census to 4,286 (3,766 Christians, 519 Muslims and one Jew) in a total of 1,014 houses. In the 1938 village statistics, the population is listed as 4,900. In the 1945 statistics, the population stood at 5,080, with Christians forming the majority of the population (4,440 Christians and 640 Muslims).

However, the demographic makeup of the town changed drastically between 1948 and 1967, when considerable emigration of Christians took place. Slightly more than half of the city&#x27;s 12,134 inhabitants were Christian by 1967, the other half Muslim.

Ramallah&#x27;s population drastically decreased in the late 20th century from 24,722 inhabitants in 1987 to 17,851 in 1997. In the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) census in 1997, Palestinian refugees accounted for 60.3% of the population, which was 17,851. There were 8,622 males and 9,229 females. People younger than 20 years of age made up 45.9% of the population, while those aged between 20 and 64 were 45.4%, and residents aged over 64 constituted 4.7%.

Only in 2005 did the population reach more than 24,000. In a PCBS projection in 2006, Ramallah had a population of 25,467 inhabitants. In the 2007 PCBS census, there were 27,460 people living in the city. Sources vary about the current Christian population in the city, ranging around 25%.

In the aftermath of the 1936–1939 Arab revolt, the Ramallah Hospital Foundation was established and registered as a tax exempt organization in New York in 1944. It bought large pieces of land in the south-eastern fringes of the city dedicated for the future hospital. In 1963, a hospital was opened. The present Ramallah Government Hospital and the Palestine Medical Centered are located on the land purchased by the Foundation. In January 1987, the first open-heart surgery was performed at the Hospital under the direction of Dr. Shehadeh (Shawki) Harb, a Palestinian surgeon trained in the United States.

==Religious institutions==
The Jamal Abdel Nasser Mosque is one of the city&#x27;s largest mosques. The Orthodox Church of Ramallah, an Orthodox Christian convent, Melkite Catholic Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church, Arab Episcopal (Anglican) Church, Ramallah Local Church (Evangelical\Born Again) and Ramallah Baptist Church all operate schools in the city. A large new church has been built on top of one of the highest hills of Ramallah, belonging to the Coptic Orthodox Church. A small group of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are present in the area as well and others.

During the annual &quot;Saturday of Light&quot; religious festival, which occurs on the Saturday between Good Friday and Easter Sunday to celebrate the light that tradition holds shines forth from the tomb of Jesus, the scouts hold a parade through the city streets to receive the flame from Jerusalem. The flame is ignited in Jerusalem&#x27;s Church of the Holy Sepulchre and is passed on through candles and lanterns to regional churches.

A variety of mosques and churches of different denominations dot the landscape.

==Culture==
Ramallah is generally considered the most affluent and cultural, as well as the most liberal, of all Palestinian cities, and is home to a number of popular Palestinian activists, poets, artists, and musicians. It boasts a lively nightlife, with many restaurants including the Stars and Bucks Cafe, a branch of the Tche Tche Cafe and the Orjuwan Lounge, described in 2010 as two among the &quot;dozens of fancy restaurants, bars and discotheques that have cropped up in Ramallah in the last three years&quot;.

One hallmark of Ramallah is Rukab&#x27;s Ice Cream, which is based on the resin of chewing gum and thus has a distinctive taste. Another is the First Ramallah Group, a boy- and girl-scout club that also holds a number of traditional dance (Dabka) performances and is also home to men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams that compete regionally. International music and dance troupes occasionally make a stop in Ramallah, and the Argentinian-Israeli pianist Daniel Barenboim performs there often. The Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center, founded in 1996, is a popular venue for such events. The Al-Kasaba Theatre is a venue for plays and movies. In 2004, the state-of-the art Ramallah Cultural Palace opened in the city. The only cultural center of its kind in the Palestinian-governed areas, it houses a 736-seat auditorium, as well as conference rooms, exhibit halls, and movie-screening rooms. It was a joint venture of the Palestinian Authority, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Japanese government. Ramallah hosted its first annual international film festival in 2004.

===Ramallah folklore===
Ramallah, like most Palestinian areas, has a rich folklore of song and dance. Songs accompanied people in every occasion, whether it was the harvest season, roofing a house, traveling, coming back from travel, engagement, wedding, or even death. Most of the songs were sung by the women with the exception of &quot;Zaffeh&quot; and &quot;Mal&#x27;ab&quot;, which are sung by the men at wedding celebrations. Palestinian educator Bahia Khalil&#x27;s book &quot;Ramallah Folklore Songs and Traditions&quot; documents to a great extent this oral tradition inherited from one generation to another. The second edition of the book was published in 2002 by the American Federation of Ramallah, Palestine, an organization for Palestinian-Americans from the Ramallah region living in the US.

===Palestinian costume===
Foreign travelers to Palestine in late-19th and early-20th centuries often commented on the rich variety of costumes among the Palestinian people, and particularly among the fellaheen or village women. Until the 1940s, a woman&#x27;s economic status, whether married or single, and the town or area they were from could be deciphered by most Palestinian women by the type of cloth, colors, cut, and embroidery motifs, or lack thereof, used for the robe-like dress or &quot;thoub&quot; in Arabic.

Though experts in the field trace the origins of Palestinian costumes to ancient times, there are no surviving clothing artifacts from this early period against which the modern items might be definitively compared. Influences from the various empires to have ruled Palestine, such as Ancient Egypt, Ancient Rome, the Byzantine Empire, and Ayyubids, among others, have been documented by scholars largely based on the depictions in art and descriptions in literature of costumes produced during these times.

Hanan Munayyer, collector and researcher of Palestinian clothing, sees examples of proto-Palestinian attire in artifacts from the Canaanite period (1500 BCE), such as Egyptian paintings depicting Canaanites in A-shaped garments. Munayyer says that from 1200 BC to AD 1940, all Palestinian dresses were cut from natural fabrics in a similar A-line shape with triangular sleeves. This shape is known to archaeologists as the &quot;Syrian tunic&quot; and appears in artifacts such as an ivory engraving from Megiddo dating to 1200 BC.

Until the 1940s, traditional Palestinian costumes reflected a woman&#x27;s economic and marital status and her town or district of origin, with knowledgeable observers discerning this information from the fabric, colours, cut, and embroidery motifs (or lack thereof) used in the apparel.

Due to the difficulty of travel in the 19th century, villages in Palestine remained isolated. As a result, clothing and accessories became a statement of region. In Ramallah, the back panels of dresses often incorporated a palm tree motif embroidered in cross-stitch. Ramallah women were famous for their distinctive dress of white linen fabric embroidered with red silk thread. The headdress or &quot;smadeh&quot; worn in Ramallah was common throughout northern Palestine: a small roundish cap, padded and stiffened, with gold and silver coins set in a fringe with a long veil pinned to the back, sometimes of silk and sometimes embroidered.

== International relations ==

<text>Overture (from French &quot;ouverture&quot;, &quot;opening&quot;) is a music instrumental introduction to a ballet, opera, or oratorio in the 17th century. During the early Romantic era, composers such as Beethoven and Mendelssohn composed overtures which were independent, self-existing, instrumental, programmatic works that foreshadowed genres such as the symphonic poem. These were &quot;at first undoubtedly intended to be played at the head of a programme&quot;.

The idea of an instrumental opening to opera existed during the 17th century. Peri&#x27;s &quot;Euridice&quot; opens with a brief instrumental ritornello, and Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; (1607) opens with a toccata, in this case a fanfare for muted trumpets. More important was the prologue, consisting of sung dialogue between allegorical characters which introduced the overarching themes of the stories depicted.

== French overture ==
As a musical form, the French overture first appears in the court ballet and operatic overtures of Jean-Baptiste Lully, which he elaborated from a similar, two-section form called &quot;ouverture&quot;, found in the French ballets de cour as early as 1640. This French overture consists of a slow introduction in a marked &quot;dotted rhythm&quot; (i.e., exaggerated iambic, if the first chord is disregarded), followed by a lively movement in fugato style. The overture is frequently followed by a series of dance tunes before the curtain rises, and often returns following the Prologue to introduce the action proper. This ouverture style was also used in English opera, most notably Henry Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Æneas&quot;. Its distinctive rhythmic profile and function thus led to the French overture style found in the works of late Baroque composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Georg Friedrich Händel, and Georg Philipp Telemann. The style is most often used in preludes to suites, and can be found in non-staged vocal works such as cantatas, for example in the opening chorus of Bach&#x27;s cantata &quot;Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland, BWV 61&quot;. Handel also uses the French overture form in some of his Italian operas, such as &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;.

== Italian overture ==
In Italy, a distinct form called &quot;overture&quot; arose in the 1680s, became established particularly through the operas of Alessandro Scarlatti, and spread throughout Europe, supplanting the French form as the standard operatic overture by the mid-18th century. Its stereotypical form is in three generally homophonic movements: fast–slow–fast. The opening movement is normally in duple metre and a major key; the slow movement in earlier examples is usually quite short, and sometimes in a contrasting key; the concluding movement is dancelike, most often with rhythms of the gigue or minuet, and returns to the key of the opening section. As the form evolved, the first movement often incorporated fanfare-like elements and took on the pattern of so-called &quot;sonatina form&quot; (sonata form without a development section), and the slow section became more extended and lyrical. Italian overtures were often detached from their operas and played as independent concert pieces. In this context, they became important in the early history of the symphony.

== 18th century ==
Prior to the 18th century, the symphony and the overture were almost interchangeable, with overtures being extracted from operas to serve as stand-alone instrumental works, and symphonies being tagged to the front of operas as overtures. With the reform of &quot;opera seria,&quot; the overture began to distinguish itself from the symphony, and composers began to link the content of overtures to their operas dramatically and emotionally. Elements from the opera are foreshadowed in the overture, following the reform ideology that the music and every other element on stages serves to enhance the plot. One such overture was that of &quot;La Magnifique&quot; by André-Ernest-Modeste Grétry, in which several of the arias are quoted. This &quot;medley form&quot; persists in the overtures to many works of musical theatre written in the 20th and 21st centuries.

== 19th-century opera ==
In 19th-century opera the overture, &quot;Vorspiel&quot;, &quot;Einleitung,&quot; Introduction, or whatever else it may be called, is generally nothing more definite than that portion of the music which takes place before the curtain rises. Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Vorspiel&quot; to &quot;Lohengrin&quot; is a short self-contained movement founded on the music of the Grail.

In Italian opera after about 1800, the &quot;overture&quot; became known as the &quot;sinfonia&quot;. Fisher also notes the term &quot;Sinfonia avanti l&#x27;opera&quot; (literally, the &quot;symphony before the opera&quot;) was &quot;an early term for a sinfonia used to begin an opera, that is, as an overture as opposed to one serving to begin a later section of the work&quot;.

==Concert overture==
===Early 19th century===
Although by the end of the eighteenth century opera overtures were already beginning to be performed as separate items in the concert hall, the &quot;concert overture&quot;, intended specifically as an individual concert piece without reference to stage performance and generally based on some literary theme, began to appear early in the Romantic era. Carl Maria von Weber wrote two concert overtures, &quot;Der Beherrscher der Geister&quot; (&#x27;The Ruler of the Spirits&#x27;, 1811, a revision of the overture to his unfinished opera &quot;Rübezahl&quot; of 1805), and &quot;Jubel-Ouvertüre&quot; (&#x27;Jubilee Overture&#x27;, 1818, incorporating &quot;God Save the King&quot; at its climax).

However, the overture &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1826) by Felix Mendelssohn is generally regarded as the first concert overture. Mendelssohn&#x27;s other contributions to this genre include his &quot;Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage&quot; overture (1828), his overture &quot;The Hebrides&quot; (1830; also known as &quot;Fingal&#x27;s Cave&quot;) and the overtures &quot;Die schöne Melusine&quot; (&quot;The Fair Melusine&quot;, 1834) and &quot;Ruy Blas&quot; (1839). Other notable early concert overtures were written by Hector Berlioz (e.g., &quot;Les Francs juges&quot; (1826), and &quot;Le corsaire&quot; (1828)).

===Later 19th century===
In the 1850s the concert overture began to be supplanted by the symphonic poem, a form devised by Franz Liszt in several works that began as dramatic overtures. The distinction between the two genres was the freedom to mould the musical form according to external programmatic requirements. The symphonic poem became the preferred form for the more &quot;progressive&quot; composers, such as César Franck, Camille Saint-Saëns, Richard Strauss, Alexander Scriabin, and Arnold Schoenberg, while more conservative composers like Anton Rubinstein, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Johannes Brahms, Robert Schumann and Arthur Sullivan remained faithful to the overture.

In the age when the symphonic poem had already become popular, Brahms wrote his &quot;Academic Festival Overture&quot;, Op. 80, as well as his &quot;Tragic Overture&quot;, Op. 81. An example clearly influenced by the symphonic poem is Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;1812 Overture&quot;. His equally well-known &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is also labelled a &#x27;fantasy-overture&#x27;.

===20th century===
In European music after 1900, an example of an overture displaying a connection with the traditional form is Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s &quot;Festive Overture&quot;, Op. 96 (1954), which is in two linked sections, &quot;Allegretto&quot; and &quot;Presto&quot; (Temperley 2001). Malcolm Arnold&#x27;s &quot;A Grand, Grand Overture&quot;, Op. 57 (1956), is a 20th-century parody of the late 19th century concert overture, scored for an enormous orchestra with organ, additional brass instruments, and obbligato parts for four rifles, three Hoover vacuum cleaners (two uprights in B, one horizontal with detachable sucker in C), and an electric floor polisher in E; it is dedicated &quot;to President Hoover&quot;.

One song of the Who&#x27;s rock opera &quot;Tommy&quot; is designated as &quot;Underture&quot;.

==Film==
In motion pictures, an overture is a piece of music setting the mood for the film before the opening credits start. Famous examples include &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939) and &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962). For a comprehensive list, see the list of films with overtures.

<doc id="44136" wikidata="Q51575" url="?curid=44136" title="John Huston">
<text>John Marcellus Huston ( ; August 5, 1906 – August 28, 1987) was an American film director, screenwriter and actor. He wrote the screenplays for most of the 37 feature films he directed, many of which are today considered classics. He received numerous accolades including two Academy Awards and three Golden Globe Awards. He also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 and the BAFTA Fellowship in 1980.

Son of actor Walter Huston, he studied and worked as a fine art painter in Paris. He then moved to Mexico and began writing, first plays and short stories, and later working in Los Angeles as a Hollywood screenwriter, and was nominated for several Academy Awards writing for films directed by William Dieterle and Howard Hawks, among others. His directorial debut came with &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941), which despite its small budget became a commercial and critical hit; he continued to be a successful, if iconoclastic, Hollywood director for the next 45 years.

Huston directed acclaimed films such as &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; (1948), &quot;Key Largo&quot; (1948), &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; (1950), &quot;The African Queen&quot; (1951), &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; (1952), &quot;Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison&quot; (1957), &quot;The Misfits&quot; (1961), &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1964), &quot;Fat City&quot; (1972), &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; (1975), &quot;Annie&quot; (1982), &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Dead&quot; (1987). During his 46-year career, Huston received 14 Academy Award nominations, winning twice. Huston acted in numerous films, receiving nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for &quot;The Cardinal&quot; (1963) and &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974) respectively. He also acted in &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967), &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; (1970) and &quot;Battle for the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1973). He voiced the wizard Gandalf in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1977).

Huston has been referred to as &quot;a titan&quot;, &quot;a rebel&quot;, and a &quot;renaissance man&quot; in the Hollywood film industry. He traveled widely, settling at various times in France, Mexico, and Ireland. Huston was a citizen of the United States by birth but renounced this to become an Irish citizen and resident in 1964. He eventually returned to the United States, where he lived the rest of his life. He was the father of actress Anjelica Huston, whom he directed to an Oscar win in &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot;.

==Early life==
John Huston was born on August 5, 1906, in Nevada, Missouri. He was the only child of Reah (née Gore) and Canadian-born Walter Huston. His father was an actor, initially in vaudeville, and later in films. His mother worked as a sports editor for various publications but stopped after John was born. Similarly, his father ended his stage acting career for steady employment as a civil engineer, although he returned to stage acting within a few years. He later became highly successful on both Broadway and then in motion pictures. He had Scottish, Scotch-Irish, English and Welsh ancestry.

Huston&#x27;s parents divorced in 1913 when he was six years old. For much of his childhood, he lived and studied in boarding schools. During summer vacations, he traveled separately with each of his parents  – with his father on vaudeville tours, and with his mother to horse races and other sports events. Young Huston benefited greatly from seeing his father act on stage, and he was later drawn to acting.

Some critics, such as Lawrence Grobel, surmise that his relationship with his mother may have contributed to his marrying five times, and seeming to have difficulty in maintaining relationships. Grobel wrote, &quot;When I interviewed some of the women who had loved him, they inevitably referred to his mother as the key to unlocking Huston&#x27;s psyche.&quot; According to actress Olivia de Havilland, &quot;she [his mother] was the central character. I always felt that John was ridden by witches. He seemed pursued by something destructive. If it wasn&#x27;t his mother, it was his idea of his mother.&quot;

As a child, Huston was often ill; he was treated for an enlarged heart and kidney ailments. He recovered after an extended bedridden stay in Arizona and moved with his mother to Los Angeles, where he attended Abraham Lincoln High School. He dropped out after two years to become a professional boxer. By age 15 he was a top-ranking amateur lightweight boxer in California. He ended his brief boxing career after suffering a broken nose.

He also engaged in many interests, including ballet, English and French literature, opera, horseback riding, and studying painting at the Art Students League of Los Angeles. Living in Los Angeles, Huston became infatuated with the new film industry and motion pictures, as a spectator only. To Huston, &quot;Charlie Chaplin was a god.&quot;

Huston returned to New York City to live with his father, who was acting in off-Broadway productions, and had a few small roles. He later remembered that while watching his father rehearse, he became fascinated with the mechanics of acting:

What I learned there, during those weeks of rehearsal, would serve me for the rest of my life.

After a short period of acting on stage, and having undergone surgery, Huston travelled alone to Mexico. During two years there, among other adventures, he obtained a position as an honorary member of the Mexican cavalry. He returned to Los Angeles and married Dorothy Harvey, a girlfriend from high school. Their marriage lasted seven years (1926–1933).

== Career ==
=== 1930–1939: Early career and directorial debut ===
During his stay in Mexico, Huston wrote a play called &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot;, based on the ballad of the same title. After selling it easily, he decided that writing would be a viable career, and he focused on it. His self-esteem was enhanced when H. L. Mencken, editor of the popular magazine &quot;American Mercury,&quot; bought two of his stories, &quot;Fool&quot; and &quot;Figures of Fighting Men.&quot; During subsequent years, Huston&#x27;s stories and feature articles were published in &quot;Esquire,&quot; &quot;Theatre Arts,&quot; and &quot;The New York Times.&quot; He also worked for a period on the &quot;New York Graphic.&quot; In 1931, when he was 25, he moved back to Los Angeles in hopes of writing for the blossoming film industry. The silent films had given way to &quot;talkies&quot;, and writers were in demand. His father had earlier moved there and already gained success in a number of films.

Huston received a script editing contract with Samuel Goldwyn Productions but, after six months of receiving no assignments, quit to work for Universal Studios, where his father was a star. At Universal, he got a job in the script department, and began by writing dialogue for a number of films in 1932, including &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;, &quot;A House Divided&quot;, and &quot;Law and Order&quot;. The last two also starred his father, Walter Huston. &quot;A House Divided&quot; was directed by William Wyler, who gave Huston his first real &quot;inside view&quot; of the filmmaking process during all stages of production. Wyler and Huston became close friends and collaborators on a number of leading films.

Huston gained a reputation as a &quot;lusty, hard-drinking libertine&quot; during his first years as a writer in Hollywood. Huston described those years as a &quot;series of misadventures and disappointments&quot;. In 1933 he was in a romantic relationship with actress Zita Johann. While driving drunk, with Johann as passenger, he hit a parked car sending Johann through the glass windshield. She suffered head trauma and Huston was charged with driving while intoxicated. His brief career as a Hollywood writer ended suddenly when he struck and killed actress Tosca Roulien, wife of actor Raul Roulien, while driving. There is a rumor that actor Clark Gable was responsible for the accident, but that MGM general manager Eddie Mannix paid Huston to take the blame. Gable was on location filming a movie, however, proving that rumor untrue. A coroner&#x27;s jury absolved Huston of blame, but the incident left him &quot;traumatized&quot;. He moved to London and Paris, living as a &quot;drifter.&quot;

By 1937, the 31-year-old Huston returned to Hollywood intent on being a &quot;serious writer.&quot; He married again, to Lesley Black. His first job was as scriptwriter with Warner Brothers Studio, and he formed his personal longterm goal to direct his own scripts. For the next four years, he co-wrote scripts for major films such as &quot;Jezebel, The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse&quot;, &quot;Juarez&quot;, &quot;Dr. Ehrlich&#x27;s Magic Bullet,&quot; and &quot;Sergeant York&quot; (1941). He was nominated for Academy Awards for his screenplays for both &quot;Ehrlich&quot; and &quot;Sergeant York.&quot; Huston wrote that &quot;Sergeant York&quot;, which was directed by Howard Hawks, has &quot;gone down as one of Howard&#x27;s best pictures, and Gary Cooper had a triumph playing the young mountaineer.&quot;

Huston was recognized and respected as a screenwriter. He persuaded the Warners to give him a chance to direct, under the condition that his next script also became a hit.

Huston wrote:
They indulged me rather. They liked my work as a writer and they wanted to keep me on. If I wanted to direct, why, they&#x27;d give me a shot at it, and if it didn&#x27;t come off all that well, they wouldn&#x27;t be too disappointed as it was to be a very small picture.

His next script was &quot;High Sierra&quot; (1941), to be directed by Raoul Walsh. The film became the hit Huston wanted. It also made Humphrey Bogart a star with his first major role, as a gunman on the run. Warners kept their end of the bargain and gave Huston his choice of subject. For his first directing assignment, Huston chose Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s detective thriller, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, a film which failed at the box office in two earlier versions by Warners. However, studio head Jack L. Warner approved of Huston&#x27;s treatment of Hammett&#x27;s 1930 novel, and he stood by his word to let Huston choose his first subject.

Huston kept the screenplay close to the novel, keeping much of Hammett&#x27;s dialogue, and directing it in an uncluttered style, much like the book&#x27;s narrative. He did unusual preparation for his first directing job by sketching out each shot beforehand, including camera positions, lighting, and compositional scale, for such elements as closeups.

He especially benefited by selecting a superior cast, giving Humphrey Bogart the lead role. Bogart was happy to take the role, as he liked working with Huston. The supporting cast included other noted actors: Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet (his first film role), and his own father, Walter Huston. The film was given only a small B-movie budget, and received minimal publicity by Warners, as they had low expectations. The entire film was made in eight weeks for only $300,000.

Warners was surprised by the immediate enthusiastic response by the public and critics, who hailed the film as a &quot;classic&quot;, with many ranking it as the &quot;best detective melodrama ever made.&quot; &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; critic Howard Barnes called it a &quot;triumph.&quot; Huston received an Academy Award nomination for the screenplay. After this film, Huston directed all of his screenplays, except for one, &quot;Three Strangers&quot; (1946).
In 1942, he directed two more hits, &quot;In This Our Life&quot; (1942), starring Bette Davis, and &quot;Across the Pacific&quot;, another thriller starring Humphrey Bogart.

===1942–1946: Army years during World War II===
In 1942 Huston served in the United States Army during World War II, making films for the Army Signal Corps. While in uniform with the rank of captain, he directed and produced three films that some critics rank as &quot;among the finest made about World War II: &quot;Report from the Aleutians&quot; (1943), about soldiers preparing for combat; &quot;The Battle of San Pietro&quot; (1945), the story (censored by the Army) of a failure by America&#x27;s intelligence agencies that resulted in many deaths, and &quot;Let There Be Light&quot; (1946), about psychologically damaged veterans. It was censored and suppressed for 35 years, until 1981.

Huston was promoted to the rank of major and received the Legion of Merit award for &quot;courageous work under battle conditions.&quot; All of his films made for the Army were &quot;controversial&quot;, and were either not released, were censored, or banned outright, as they were considered &quot;demoralizing&quot; to soldiers and the public. &quot;Let There Be Light&quot; was the most controversial as the Army banned the film from public viewing due to the ethics of filming the soldiers&#x27; recovery and the lack of written permission supplied by Huston. Years later, after Huston moved to Ireland, his daughter, actress Anjelica Huston, recalled that the &quot;main movies we watched were the war documentaries.&quot;

Huston performed an uncredited rewrite of Anthony Veiller&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;The Stranger&quot; (1946), a film he was to have directed. When Huston became unavailable, the film&#x27;s star, Orson Welles, directed instead; Welles had the lead role of a high-ranking Nazi fugitive who settles in New England under an assumed name.

=== 1947–1951: Breakthrough and acclaim ===
 &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; (1948)

Huston&#x27;s next picture, which he wrote, directed, and briefly appeared in as an American asked to &quot;help out a fellow American, down on his luck&quot;, was &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; (1948). It would become one of the films that established his reputation as a leading filmmaker. The film, also starring Humphrey Bogart, was the story of three drifters who band together to prospect for gold. Huston gave a supporting role to his father, Walter Huston.

Warners studio was initially uncertain what to make of the film. They had allowed Huston to film on location in Mexico, which was a &quot;radical move&quot; for a studio at the time. They also knew that Huston was gaining a reputation as &quot;one of the wild men of Hollywood.&quot; In any case, studio boss Jack L. Warner initially &quot;detested it.&quot; But whatever doubts Warners had were soon removed, as the film achieved widespread public and critical acclaim. Hollywood writer James Agee called it &quot;one of the most beautiful and visually alive movies I have ever seen.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine described it as &quot;one of the best things Hollywood has done since it learned to talk.&quot; Huston won Oscars for Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay; his father won for Best Supporting Actor. The film also won other awards in the U.S. and overseas.

Decades later, &quot;Film Comment&quot; magazine devoted four pages to the film in its May–June 1980 edition, with author Richard T. Jameson offering his impressions:

This film has impressed itself on the heart and mind and soul of anyone who has seen it, to the extent that filmmakers of great originality and distinctiveness like Robert Altman and Sam Peckinpah can be said to have remade it again and again ... without compromising its uniqueness.

 &quot;Key Largo&quot; (1948)

Also in 1948, Huston directed &quot;Key Largo&quot;, again starring Humphrey Bogart. It was the story about a disillusioned veteran who clashes with gangsters on a remote Florida key. It co-starred Lauren Bacall, Claire Trevor, Edward G. Robinson, and Lionel Barrymore. The film was an adaptation of the stage play by Maxwell Anderson. Some viewers complained that it was still overly stage-bound. But the &quot;outstanding performances&quot; by all the actors saved the film, and Claire Trevor won an Oscar for best supporting actress. Huston was annoyed that the studio cut several scenes from the final release without his agreement. That, along with some earlier disputes, angered Huston enough that he left the studio when his contract expired.

 &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; (1950)

In 1950 he wrote and directed &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot;, a film which broke new ground by depicting criminals as somewhat sympathetic characters, simply doing their professional work, &quot;an occupation like any other&quot;. Huston described their work as &quot;a left-handed form of human endeavor.&quot; Huston achieved that effect by giving &quot;deep attention&quot; to the plot, involving a large jewelry theft, by examining the minute, step-by-step details and difficulties each of the characters had of carrying it out. Some critics felt that, by this technique, Huston had achieved an almost &quot;documentary&quot; style.

His assistant director Albert Band explains further:
Film critic Andrew Sarris considered it to be &quot;Huston&#x27;s best film&quot;, and the film that made Marilyn Monroe a recognized actress. Sarris also notes the similar themes in many of Huston&#x27;s films, as exemplified by this one: &quot;His protagonists almost invariably fail at what they set out to do.&quot; This theme was also expressed in &quot;Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;, where the group foundered on their own greed.

It starred Sterling Hayden and Sam Jaffe, a personal friend of Huston. Marilyn Monroe had her first serious role in this film. Huston said, &quot;it was, of course, where Marilyn Monroe got her start.&quot; Monroe said Huston was the first genius she had ever met; and he made her feel that she finally had a chance of becoming a professional actress:
The film succeeded at the box office, and Huston was again nominated for an Oscar for best screenplay and best director, along with winning the Screen Directors Guild Award. This became a model for many similar movies by other filmmakers.

 &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; (1951)

Huston&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; (1951), was of a completely different subject: war and its effect on soldiers. While in the army during World War II, he became interested in Stephen Crane&#x27;s classic American Civil War novel of the same title. For the starring role, Huston chose World War II hero Audie Murphy to play the young Union soldier who deserts his company out of fear, but later returns to fight alongside them. MGM was concerned that the movie seemed too antiwar for the postwar period. Without Huston&#x27;s input, they cut down the running time of the film from eighty-eight minutes to sixty-nine, added narration, and deleted what Huston felt was a crucial scene.

The movie did poorly at the box office. Huston suggests that it was possibly because it &quot;brought war very close to home.&quot; Huston recalls that at the preview showing, before the film was halfway through, &quot;damn near a third of the audience got up and walked out of the theater.&quot; Despite the &quot;butchering&quot; and weak public response, film historian Michael Barson describes the movie as &quot;a minor masterpiece.&quot;

At the same time, the film was also the cause of a growing feud between MGM founder Louis B. Mayer and Producer Dore Schary to the point where Huston felt like stepping down to avoid growing the conflict. However, Mayer encouraged Huston to stay on telling him to fight for the picture regardless of what he thought of it.

 &quot;The African Queen&quot; (1951)
Before &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; opened in theaters, Huston was already in Africa shooting &quot;The African Queen&quot; (1951), a story based on C. S. Forester&#x27;s popular novel. It starred Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn in a combination of romance, comedy and adventure. Barson calls it &quot;one of the most popular Hollywood movies of all time.&quot; The film&#x27;s producer, Sam Spiegel, urged Huston to change the ending to allow the protagonists to survive, instead of dying. Huston agreed, and the ending was rewritten. It became Huston&#x27;s most successful film financially, and &quot;it remains one of his finest works.&quot; Huston was nominated for two Academy Awards—Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. Bogart, meanwhile, won his only Oscar for Best Actor for his role as Charlie Allnut.

Hepburn wrote about her experiences shooting the film in her memoir, &quot;The Making of the African Queen: Or How I went to Africa with Bogart, Bacall, and Huston and almost lost my mind&quot;. Clint Eastwood directed and starred in the film &quot;White Hunter, Black Heart&quot;, based on Peter Viertel&#x27;s novel of the same name, which tells a fictional version of the making of the film.

=== 1952–1966: HCUA period ===
In 1952 Huston moved to Ireland as a result of his &quot;disgust&quot; at the &quot;witch-hunt&quot; and the &quot;moral rot&quot; he felt was created by investigation and hearings by the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA), which had affected many of his friends in the movie industry. Huston had, with friends including director William Wyler and screenwriter Philip Dunne, established the &quot;Committee for the First Amendment&quot;, as a response to the ongoing government investigations into communists within the film industry. The HCUA was calling numerous filmmakers, screenwriters, and actors to testify about any past affiliations.

He later described, in general, the types of people who were alleged communists:
Huston took producing, writing, and directing credits for his next two films: &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; (1952); and &quot;Beat the Devil&quot; (1953). &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (1956), however, was written by Ray Bradbury, although Huston had his name added to the screenplay credit after the completion of the project. Although Huston had personally hired Bradbury to adapt Herman Melville&#x27;s novel into a screenplay, Bradbury and Huston did not get along during pre-production. Bradbury later dramatized their relationship in the short story &quot;Banshee&quot;. When this was adapted as an episode of &quot;The Ray Bradbury Theater,&quot; Peter O&#x27;Toole played the role based on John Huston. Bradbury wrote more poems, essays, and stories on his time in Ireland, but was reluctant to write a book because he did not want to gossip about Huston. It was not until after he read Katharine Hepburn&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Making of the African Queen,&quot; that he decided that he could write &quot;a book which is fair, which presents the Huston that I loved along with the one that I began to fear on occasion.&quot; He published &quot;Green Shadows, White Whale&quot;, a novel about his time in Ireland with Huston, almost 40 years after he wrote the screenplay for &quot;Moby Dick&quot;.

Huston had been planning to film Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; for the previous ten years, and originally thought the starring role of Captain Ahab would be an excellent part for his father, Walter Huston. After his father died in 1950, Huston chose Gregory Peck to play the role. The movie was filmed over a three-year period on location in Ireland, where Huston was living. The fishing village of New Bedford, Massachusetts, was recreated along the waterfront; the sailing ship in the film was fully constructed to be seaworthy; and three 100-foot whales were built out of steel, wood, and plastic. In the film, Huston&#x27;s voice was dubbed for the voice of actor Joseph Tomelty and a Pequod lookout. But the film failed at the box office. Critics such as David Robinson suggested that the movie lacked the &quot;mysticism of the book&quot; and thereby &quot;loses its significance.&quot;
Of Huston&#x27;s next five films, only &quot;The Misfits&quot; (1961), gained critical approval. Critics have since noted the &quot;retrospective atmosphere of doom&quot; associated with the film. Clark Gable, the star, died of a heart attack a few weeks after the filming was completed; Marilyn Monroe never finished another film, and died a year later after being suspended during the filming of &quot;Something&#x27;s Got to Give&quot;; and costars Montgomery Clift (1966) and Thelma Ritter (1969) also died over the next decade. But two of the &quot;Misfits&quot; stars, Eli Wallach and Kevin McCarthy, lived another 50 years. During the filming, Monroe was sometimes taking prescribed drugs, which led to her arriving late on the set. Monroe also sometimes forgot her lines. Monroe&#x27;s personal problems eventually led to the breakup of her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller, the scriptwriter, &quot;virtually on set.&quot; Miller dramatized the making of &quot;The Misfits&quot; in his final play, &quot;Finishing the Picture&quot;, where Huston is represented as the director. Huston later commented about this period in Monroe&#x27;s career: &quot;Marilyn was on her way out. Not only of the picture, but of life.&quot;

He followed &quot;The Misfits&quot; with &quot;&quot;, a film quite different from most of his others. Besides directing, he also narrates portions of the story. Film historian Stuart M. Kaminsky notes that Huston presents Sigmund Freud, played by Montgomery Clift, &quot;as a kind of savior and messiah&quot;, with an &quot;almost Biblical detachment.&quot; As the film begins, Huston describes Freud as a &quot;kind of hero or God on a quest for mankind&quot;:

This is the story of Freud&#x27;s descent into a region as black as hell, man&#x27;s unconscious, and how he let in the light.

Huston explains how he became interested in psychotherapy, the subject of the film:

For his next film, Huston again traveled to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, after meeting an architect, Guillermo Wulff, who owned property and businesses in the town. The filming of &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; took place in a beach cove called Mismaloya, about thirty minutes south of town. Huston adapted the stage play by Tennessee Williams. The film stars Richard Burton and Ava Gardner, and was nominated for several Academy Awards. The production attracted intense worldwide media attention, due to Burton bringing his celebrity mistress, actress Elizabeth Taylor (who was still married to singer Eddie Fisher at the time) to Puerto Vallarta. Huston liked the town where filming took place so much that he bought a house near there, as did Burton and Taylor. Guillermo Wulff and Huston became friends and always spent time together while Huston was in town, more frequently at Wulff&#x27;s El Dorado Restaurant on Los Muertos Beach.

Producer Dino De Laurentis traveled to Ireland to ask Huston to direct &quot;The Bible: In the Beginning&quot;. Although De Laurentis had ambitions for a broader story, he realized that the subject could not be adequately covered and limited the story to less than the first half of the Book of Genesis. Huston enjoyed directing the film, as it gave him a chance to indulge his love of animals. Besides directing he also played the role of Noah and the voice of God. &quot;The Bible&quot; earned rentals of $15 million in North America, making it the second highest-grossing film of 1966. However, because of its bloated budget of $18 million (which made it the most expensive movie of Huston&#x27;s career), 20th Century Fox ended up losing $1.5 million.

Huston enjoyed describing details about the filming:
Every morning before beginning work, I visited the animals. One of the elephants, Candy, loved to be scratched on the belly behind her foreleg. I&#x27;d scratch her and she would lean farther and farther toward me until there was some danger of her toppling over on me. One time I started to walk away from her, and she reached out and took my wrist with her trunk and pulled me back to her side. It was a command: &quot;Don&#x27;t stop!&quot; I used it in the picture. Noah scratches the elephant&#x27;s belly and walks away, and the elephant pulls him back to her time after time.

=== 1967–1969: Involvement with the Irish film industry===
While working on &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967), Huston took interest in the Irish film industry, which had historically struggled to attain domestic or international success. There were rumours that he would buy Ireland&#x27;s premiere film location, Ardmore Studios in Bray, County Wicklow. In 1967, Huston gave Taoiseach Jack Lynch a tour of Ardmore and asked to form a committee to help foster a productive Irish film industry. Huston served on the resulting committee with Irish filmmakers and journalists.

Lynch also ultimately agreed to offer tax breaks to foreign production companies if they shot on location in Ireland, and signed the Film Act of 1970.

Huston was interviewed in Irish journalist Peter Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Rocky Road to Dublin&quot; (1967), where he argued that it was more important for Irish filmmakers to make films in Ireland than for foreign production companies to make international films.

In 1969, he shot &quot;Sinful Davey&quot; in Ireland using a mixed Irish and British cast.

=== 1972–1987: Later career and final films ===
After several films that were not well received, Huston returned to critical acclaim with &quot;Fat City&quot;. Based on Leonard Gardner&#x27;s 1969 novel of the same name, it was about an aging, washed-up alcoholic boxer in Stockton, California, trying to get his name back on the map, while having a new relationship with a world-weary alcoholic. It also featured an amateur boxer trying to find success in boxing. The film was nominated for several awards. It starred Stacy Keach, a young Jeff Bridges, and Susan Tyrrell; she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Roger Ebert stated &quot;Fat City&quot; was one of Huston&#x27;s best films, giving it four out of four stars.

Perhaps Huston&#x27;s most highly regarded film of the 1970s, &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; was both a critical and commercial success. Huston had been planning to make this film since the &#x27;50s, originally with his friends Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable. Eventually, the lead roles went to Sean Connery and Michael Caine. The movie was filmed on location in North Africa. The film was praised for its use of old-fashioned escapism and entertainment. Steven Spielberg has cited the film as one of the inspirations for his film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;.

After filming &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot;, Huston took his longest break between directing films. He returned with an offbeat and somewhat controversial film based on the novel &quot;Wise Blood&quot;. Here, Huston showed his skills as a storyteller, and boldness when it came to difficult subjects such as religion. &quot;Under the Volcano&quot;, Huston&#x27;s last film set in Mexico, stars Albert Finney as an alcoholic ambassador during the beginnings of World War II. Adapted from the 1947 novel by Malcolm Lowry, the film was highly praised by critics, most notably for Finney&#x27;s portrayal of a desperate and depressed alcoholic. The film was a success on the independent circuit.

John Huston&#x27;s final film, 1987&#x27;s &quot;The Dead&quot;, is an adaptation of the classic short story by James Joyce. This may have been one of Huston&#x27;s most personal films, due to his citizenship in Ireland and his passion for classic literature. Huston directed most of the film from a wheelchair, as he needed an oxygen tank to breathe during the last few months of his life. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards and was praised by critics. Roger Ebert eventually placed it in his Great Movies list; a section of movies he claimed to be some of the best ever made. Huston died nearly four months before the film&#x27;s release date. In the 1996 RTÉ documentary &quot;John Huston: An t-Éireannach&quot;, Anjelica Huston said that
&quot;it was very important for my father to make that film.&quot; She contends that Huston did not think that it was going to be his last film, but that it was his love letter to Ireland and the Irish.

==As an actor==
While he had done some stage acting in his youth and had occasionally cast himself in bit parts in his own films. Earlier in his career, he had played bit parts in his own films, such as the unnamed rich American in &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;. Towards the end of his career, Huston began to play more prominent roles in films by other directors. In 1963, director Otto Preminger asked if he would portray a Boston prelate in &quot;The Cardinal&quot;, and, writes author Philip Kemp, he &quot;virtually stole the picture.&quot; He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role. He had a little participation (as did many others) in 1967&#x27;s &quot;Casino Royale&quot; as actor and director. He acted in Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974) as the film&#x27;s master villain, Noah Cross. For his performance he earned a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture. He also acted as President Teddy Roosevelt&#x27;s secretary of state John Hay in &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot;. Huston enjoyed acting and denied that he took it all that seriously. &quot;It&#x27;s a cinch,&quot; he once said, &quot;and they pay you damn near as much as you make directing.&quot;

He continued to take prominent supporting roles for the next two decades, including 1974&#x27;s &quot;Chinatown&quot; (directed by Roman Polanski), and he lent his booming baritone voice as a voice actor and narrator to a number of prominent films. His last two films, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot;, and 1987&#x27;s &quot;The Dead&quot;, filmed while he was in failing health at the end of his life, were both nominated for multiple Academy Awards. He died shortly after completing his last film. Huston said he did not regard himself very highly as an actor, saying he was proud only of his performance in &quot;Chinatown.&quot; But he had also greatly enjoyed acting in &quot;Winter Kills&quot;. He also played the Lawgiver in &quot;Battle for the Planet of the Apes&quot;.

Huston is famous to a generation of fans of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth stories as the voice of the wizard Gandalf in the Rankin/Bass animated adaptations of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; (1980).

Huston played the lead in Orson Welles&#x27;s last completed film, &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot;. In it he played an aging filmmaker named Jake Hannaford who was having great problems getting financing for his latest uncompleted film. Much of his portrayal was filmed in the spring of 1974 in Carefree, Arizona, at Southwestern Studio and a nearby mansion. But due to political and financial complications, &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot; was not released until the fall of 2018.

==Movie themes==
Author Ian Freer describes him as &quot;cinema&#x27;s Ernest Hemingway&quot;—a filmmaker who was &quot;never afraid to tackle tough issues head on.&quot; Huston&#x27;s films were insightful about human nature and human predicaments. They also sometimes included scenes or brief dialogue passages that were remarkably prescient concerning environmental issues that came to public awareness in the future, in the period starting about 1970; examples include &quot;The Misfits&quot; and &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1964). Huston spent long evenings carousing in the Nevada casinos after filming, surrounded by reporters and beautiful women, gambling, drinking, and smoking cigars.

According to Kaminsky, Huston&#x27;s stories were often about &quot;failed quests&quot; by a group of different people. The group would persist in the face of poor odds, doomed at the outset by the circumstances created by an impossible situation. However, some members of the doomed group usually survive, those who are &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;intelligent&quot;, or someone who &quot;will sacrifice everything for self-understanding and independence&quot;. Those types of characters are exemplified by Bogart in &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, and Montgomery Clift in &quot;Freud.&quot;

Another type of quest often seen in Huston&#x27;s films involves a pair of potential lovers trying to face a hostile world. Flint adds, however, that he &quot;bucked Hollywood&#x27;s penchant for happy endings&quot;, and many of his stories ended with &quot;love unsatisfied&quot;.

Film historian James Goodwin adds that in virtually all of his films, there is some type of &quot;heroic quest – even if it involves questionable motives or destructive alliances&quot;. In addition, the quest &quot;is preferable to the spiritless, amoral routines of life&quot;. As a result, his best films, according to Flint, &quot;have lean, fast-paced scripts and vibrant plots and characterizations, and many of them deal ironically with vanity, avarice and unfulfilled quests&quot;.

In the opinion of critics Tony Tracy and Roddy Flynn, &quot;... what fundamentally fascinated Huston was not movies &quot;per se&quot; – that is, form – but the human condition ... and literature offered a road map for exploring that condition.&quot; In many of his films, therefore, he tried to express his interest by developing themes involving some of the &quot;grand narratives&quot; of the twentieth century, such as &quot;faith, meaning, truth, freedom, psychology, colonialism, war and capitalism&quot;.

To Jameson, all of Huston&#x27;s films are adaptations, and he believes that through his films there was a &quot;cohesive world-view, not only thematically but also stylistically; there is the Huston look&quot;. The &quot;Huston look&quot; was also noted by screenwriter James Agee, who adds that this &quot;look proceeds from Huston&#x27;s sense of what is natural to the eye and his delicate, simple feeling for space relationships.&quot; In any case, notes Flint, Huston took &quot;uncommon care to preserve the writer&#x27;s styles and values ... and sought repeatedly to transpose the interior essence of literature to film with dramatic and visual tension&quot;, as he did in &quot;Red Badge of Courage,&quot; &quot;Moby Dick,&quot; and &quot;Under the Volcano.&quot;

Religion is also a theme that runs through many of Huston&#x27;s films. In &quot;The Night of the Iguana,&quot; Kaminsky notes how Richard Burton, while preaching a sermon to his congregation, seems &quot;lost, confused, his speech is gibberish&quot;, and leads his congregation to turn away from him. In other films, adds Kaminsky, religion is seen as &quot;part of the fantasy world&quot;, that the actors must overcome to survive physically or emotionally. &quot;These religious zealots counsel a move away from the pleasure of the world and human love, a world that Huston believes in,&quot; concludes Kaminsky. Such religious themes were also seen in &quot;The Bible,&quot; and &quot;Wise Blood,&quot; for example.

To Barson, however, Huston was among the &quot;least consistent&quot; filmmakers, although he concludes that he was one of the &quot;most interesting directors of the past sixty years&quot;. Throughout his long career, many of his films did poorly and were criticized as a result. To a writer in 1972 he commented, &quot;Criticism isn&#x27;t a new experience for me. Pictures that are now thought of as, forgive the term, classics, weren&#x27;t all that well thought of at the time they came out.&quot; After an interview a few years before he died, the reporter writes that &quot;Huston said he missed the major studio era when people savored making movies, not just money.&quot;

According to Roger Ebert, in his review of &quot;Fat City&quot;, &quot;His fascination with underdogs and losers. The characters in Huston movies hardly ever set out to achieve what they&#x27;re aiming for. Sam Spade, in &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, Huston&#x27;s first film, ends up minus one partner and one woman he thought he could trust. Everyone is a loser in &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;, and the gold blows back into the dust and is lost in it. Ahab, in &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. Marlon Brando&#x27;s career Army officer in &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot;, even Bogart and Hepburn in &quot;The African Queen&quot; – they all fall short of their plans. &quot;The African Queen&quot; does have a happy ending, but it feels tacked-on and ridiculous, and the Queen destroys itself in destroying the German steamer. So this &quot;[Fat City]&quot; is a theme we find in Huston&#x27;s work, but rarely does he fit it to characters and a time and place so well as in &quot;Fat City&quot;. Maybe that&#x27;s because Huston knows the territory: he was a professional boxer himself for a while, and not a very good one.&quot;

==Directing techniques==
He explored the visual aspects of his films throughout his career, sketching each scene on paper beforehand, then carefully framing his characters during the shooting. While most directors rely on post-production editing to shape their final work, Huston instead created his films while they were being shot, with little editing needed. Some of Huston&#x27;s films were adaptations of important novels, often depicting a &quot;heroic quest&quot;, as in &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, or &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;. In many films, different groups of people, while struggling toward a common goal, would become doomed, forming &quot;destructive alliances&quot;, giving the films a dramatic and visual tension. Many of his films involved themes such as religion, meaning, truth, freedom, psychology, colonialism, and war.

George Stevens, Jr. notes that while many directors rely on post-production editing to shape their final work, Huston instead created his films while they were being shot: &quot;I don&#x27;t even know the editor of my films most of the time,&quot; Huston said. Actor Michael Caine also observed the same technique: &quot;Most directors don&#x27;t know what they want so they shoot everything they can think of — they use the camera like a machine gun. John uses it like a sniper.&quot; Danny Huston confirmed as much when he recalled what Huston said to him as the then-youngster was fooling around with a Kodak Super 8: &quot;and I was shooting all these various things. He said, &#x27;Stop it, stop doing that.&#x27; I said, &#x27;What?&#x27; He said, &#x27;When you go from left to right and right to left, what do you do?&#x27; So I looked from left to right and right to left. I said, &#x27;I give up. What do I do?&#x27; He said, &#x27;You blink. That&#x27;s a cut.&#x27;&quot;

Film writer Peter Flint pointed out other benefits to Huston&#x27;s style: &quot;He shot economically, eschewing the many protective shots favored by timid directors, and edited cerebrally so that financial backers would have trouble trying to cut scenes.&quot; Huston shot most of his films on location, working &quot;intensely&quot; six days a week, and &quot;on Sundays, played equally intense poker with the cast and crew.&quot;

When asked how he envisions his films while directing and what his goals are, Huston replied:

To me the ideal film — which I&#x27;ve never succeeded in making — would be as though the reel were behind one&#x27;s eyes and you were projecting it yourself, seeing what you wish to see. This has a great deal in common with thought processes ... That&#x27;s why I think the camera is an eye as well as a mind. Everything we do with the camera has physiological and mental significance.

According to Kaminsky, much of Huston&#x27;s vision probably came from his early experience as a painter on the streets of Paris. While there, he studied art and worked at it for a year and a half. Huston continued painting as a hobby for most of his life. Kaminsky also notes that most of Huston&#x27;s films &quot;reflected this prime interest in the image, the moving portrait and the use of color.&quot; Huston explored the use of &quot;stylistic framing&quot;, especially well-planned close-ups, in much of his directing. In his first film, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, for instance, Huston sketched out all of his scenes beforehand, &quot;like canvases of paintings&quot;. Anjelica Huston recalled that even for his subsequent films, he sketched storyboards &quot;constantly... it was a form of study, and my father was a painter, a very good one... there was an extremely developed sensory quality about my father, he didn&#x27;t miss a trick.&quot;

== Personal life ==
To producer George Stevens Jr., Huston symbolized &quot;intellect, charm and physical grace&quot; within the film industry. He adds, &quot;He was the most charismatic of the directors I knew, speaking with a soothing, melodic voice that was often mimicked, but was unique to him.&quot; Huston loved the outdoors, especially hunting while living in Ireland. Among his life&#x27;s adventures before becoming a Hollywood filmmaker, he had been an amateur boxer, reporter, short-story writer, portrait artist in Paris, a cavalry rider in Mexico, and a documentary filmmaker during World War II. Besides sports and adventure, he enjoyed hard liquor and relationships with women. Stevens describes him as someone who &quot;lived life to its fullest&quot;. Barson even suggests that Huston&#x27;s &quot;flamboyant life&quot; as a rebel would possibly make for &quot;an even more engaging tale than most of his movies&quot;.

=== 1933 car accident ===
While driving on Sunset Boulevard on September 25, 1933, Huston struck and killed a pedestrian, a Brazilian dancer named Tosca Roulien, wife of Raul Roulien. The resulting media frenzy forced Huston to retreat temporarily from public performance and instead work as a screenwriter. A subsequent inquest absolved Huston of any blame for the accident. 

About six months prior to this accident, while driving drunk, Huston crashed into a parked car injuring his passenger and his partner at the time, actress Zita Johann. Johann suffered head trauma as she was thrown through the windshield. Huston was charged with driving while intoxicated.
=== Beliefs ===
It has been suggested that John Huston was an atheist, but his religious beliefs are hard to determine. He claimed that he had no orthodox religion. His daughter, Anjelica, was raised Roman Catholic, and said that he did not like Hollywood, and &quot;especially despised Beverly Hills ... he thought it was just fake from the ground up. He didn&#x27;t like any of that; he was not intrigued or attracted by it.&quot; She said that, in contrast, &quot;he liked to be in the wild places; he liked animals as much as he liked people.&quot;

=== Marriages ===
Huston married five times. His wives were:

# Dorothy Harvey (1906–1982) — This youthful marriage ended after seven years (October 17, 1926 – January 10, 1933).
# Lesley Black  — (m. 1937; div. 1945) — During his marriage to Black he embarked on an affair with a married New York socialite, Marietta FitzGerald. While her lawyer husband was contributing to the war effort, the pair were once rumoured to have made love so vigorously they broke a friend&#x27;s bed.
# Evelyn Keyes (1916–2008) – (m. 1946; div. 1950) – They adopted a son Pablo, who John discovered orphaned in Mexico.
# Enrica Soma (1929–1969) – (m. 1950; died 1969) – Huston &amp; Soma were married until she died at age 39 in a car accident. They had two children: Walter Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Huston (b. 1950), screenwriter and attorney, father of actor Jack Huston; and a daughter, actress Anjelica Huston (b. 1951). During the marriage, Huston fathered a son, Danny Huston (b. 1962), with author Zoe Sallis. Danny became an actor. Soma also had a child from an extramarital affair during their marriage. Her daughter, Allegra Huston (b. 1964), is the child of John Julius Norwich. After Soma died at the age of 39, Huston treated the girl as one of his own children.
# Celeste Shane – (m. 1972; div. 1977) – In his autobiography, &quot;An Open Book&quot;, Huston refers to her as a &quot;crocodile&quot;, and says that if he had his life to do over, he would not have married a fifth time.
Huston visited Ireland in 1951 and stayed at Luggala, County Wicklow, the home of Garech Browne, a member of the Guinness family. He visited Ireland several times afterwards and on one of these visits, he purchased and restored a Georgian home, St Clerans, of Craughwell, County Galway. Between 1960 and 1971 he served as Master of Fox Hounds (MFH) of the County Galway Hunt, whose kennels are at Craughwell. He renounced his U.S. citizenship and became an Irish citizen in 1964. His daughter Anjelica attended school in Ireland at Kylemore Abbey for a number of years. A film school is now dedicated to him on the NUI Galway campus.

=== Painting ===
Huston was an accomplished painter who wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Nothing has played a more important role in my life&quot;. As a young man, he studied at the Smith School of Art in Los Angeles but dropped out within a few months. He later studied at the Art Students League of New York. He painted throughout his life and had studios in each of his homes. He had owned a wide collection of art, including a notable collection of Pre-Columbian art.

=== Illness and death ===
A heavy smoker, Huston was diagnosed with emphysema in 1978. By the last year of his life he could not breathe for more than twenty minutes without needing oxygen. He died on August 28, 1987, in his rented home in Middletown, Rhode Island, from pneumonia as a complication of lung disease, aged 81. Huston is interred in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood with his mother. His friends included George Hodel, Orson Welles, and Ernest Hemingway. Humphrey Bogart was one of his best friends, and Huston delivered the eulogy at his funeral.

==Archives==
The moving image collection of John Huston is held at the Academy Film Archive. The film material at the Academy Film Archive is complemented by production files, photographs, and personal correspondence found in the John Huston papers, 1932–1981, at the academy&#x27;s Margaret Herrick Library. The film archive preserved several of John Huston&#x27;s home movies in 2001.

==Filmography==
=== As screenwriter only ===
=== As an actor ===
==Awards and honors==
Huston received 15 Oscar nominations in the course of his career and became the oldest person ever to be nominated for the Best Director Oscar when, at 79 years old, he was nominated for &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot; (1985), a record he would hold until 2023, when Martin Scorsese attained a nomination at the age of 81 for directing &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon&quot;. Huston won two Oscars, for directing and writing the screenplay for &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;. Huston also won a Golden Globe for that film. He received the Life Achievement Award from the American Film Institute in 1983, and the Career Achievement Award from the U.S. National Board of Review of Motion Pictures in 1984.

He also has the unique distinction of directing both his father Walter and his daughter Anjelica in Oscar-winning performances (in &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; and &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot;, respectively), making the Hustons the first family to have three generations of Academy Award winners. He also directed her in &quot;Sinful Davey&quot; in 1969.

In addition, he also directed 13 other actors in Oscar-nominated performances: Sydney Greenstreet, Claire Trevor, Sam Jaffe, Humphrey Bogart, Katharine Hepburn, José Ferrer, Colette Marchand, Deborah Kerr, Grayson Hall, Susan Tyrrell, Albert Finney, Jack Nicholson and William Hickey.

In 1960, Huston was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to motion pictures. In 1965, Huston received the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement from the Writers Guild of America. In 1981, his film &quot;Escape to Victory&quot; was nominated for the Golden Prize at the 12th Moscow International Film Festival. A statue of Huston, sitting in his director&#x27;s chair, stands in Plaza John Huston in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.

<text>A cantata (; ; literally &quot;sung&quot;, past participle feminine singular of the Italian verb &quot;cantare&quot;, &quot;to sing&quot;) is a vocal composition with an instrumental accompaniment, typically in several movements, often involving a choir.

The meaning of the term changed over time, from the simple single-voice madrigal of the early 17th century, to the multi-voice &quot;cantata da camera&quot; and the &quot;cantata da chiesa&quot; of the later part of that century, from the more substantial dramatic forms of the 18th century to the usually sacred-texted 19th-century cantata, which was effectively a type of short oratorio. Cantatas for use in the liturgy of church services are called church cantata or sacred cantatas; other cantatas can be indicated as secular cantatas. Several cantatas were, and still are, written for special occasions, such as Christmas cantatas. Christoph Graupner, Georg Philipp Telemann and Johann Sebastian Bach composed cycles of church cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year.

==Historical context==
The term originated in the early 17th century, simultaneously with opera and oratorio. Prior to that, all &quot;cultured&quot; music was vocal. With the rise of instrumental music, the term appeared, while instrumental art became sufficiently developed to be embodied in sonatas. From the beginning of the 17th century until late in the 18th, the cantata for one or two solo voices with accompaniment of basso continuo (and perhaps a few solo instruments) was a principal form of Italian vocal chamber music.

A cantata consisted first of a declamatory narrative or scene in recitative, held together by a primitive aria repeated at intervals. Fine examples may be found in the church music of Giacomo Carissimi; and the English vocal solos of Henry Purcell (such as &quot;Mad Tom&quot; and &quot;Mad Bess&quot;) show the utmost that can be made of this archaic form. With the rise of the da capo aria, the cantata became a group of two or three arias joined by recitative. George Frideric Handel&#x27;s numerous Italian duets and trios are examples on a rather large scale. His Latin motet &quot;Silete Venti&quot;, for soprano solo, shows the use of this form in church music.

==Differences from other musical forms==

The Italian solo cantata tended, when on a large scale, to become indistinguishable from a scene in an opera, in the same way the church cantata, solo or choral, is indistinguishable from a small oratorio or portion of an oratorio. This is equally evident whether one examines the church cantatas of Bach, of which nearly 200 are extant (see List of Bach cantatas) or the &quot;Chandos Anthems&quot; of Handel. In Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s case, some of the larger cantatas are actually called oratorios, and the &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot; is a collection of six church cantatas actually intended for performance on six different days, though together they form as complete an artistic whole as any classical oratorio.

==Baroque==

During the baroque era, the term &quot;cantata&quot; generally retained its original Italian usage to describe a secular vocal piece of extended length, often in different sections, and usually Italianate in style. At the same time, vocal pieces of similar scope, often with several singers, and various instruments, were in great demand for the services of the Lutheran church. Such pieces were usually called &quot;geistliche Konzerte&quot; (singular: &quot;geistliches Konzert&quot;, meaning sacred concerto). Many of these pieces were simply called by their opening text. Such pieces for the liturgy or other occasions were not only composed by Bach but also by Dieterich Buxtehude, Christoph Graupner, Gottfried Heinrich Stölzel and Georg Philipp Telemann, to name a few. The editors of the Bach Gesellschaft adopted &quot;sacred cantata&quot; as a convenient catchall for most of Bach&#x27;s liturgical pieces. The term was then retroactively applied by Philipp Spitta to refer to comparable works by composers from Heinrich Schütz onwards. Many secular cantatas were composed for events in the nobility. They were so similar in form to the sacred ones that many of them were parodied (in parts or completely) to sacred cantatas, for example in Bach&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot;.

===Bach cantatas===
Johann Sebastian Bach, almost 200 of whose cantatas survive, is a notable contributor to the genre.
His cantatas are usually written for a baroque orchestra consisting of a string section, an oboe section, and a continuo group, timpani and brass were sometimes added on festive occasions such as Christmas or Easter. The vocal forces consisted of a four-part choir and soloists. Bach also wrote some cantatas for only one solo singer (ex. BWV 51).

===Graupner&#x27;s cantatas===
Christoph Graupner was Hofkapellmeister at the court of Hesse-Darmstadt and provided over 1,400 cantatas during his nearly 50 years of employment there, making him the most significant contributor to the genre. While only a handful of Bach&#x27;s cantatas contain accompanied chorales (the vocal parts are usually doubled by the instrumental parts), nearly all of Graupner&#x27;s chorales feature elaborate ritornello sections. This is possibly because Bach&#x27;s Leipzig congregation was expected to sing along with them, but the Darmstadt court was not. Also, many of Graupner&#x27;s cantatas exploit elaborate orchestral effects and use exotic instrumentation, such as chalumeau, flûte d&#x27;amour, oboe d&#x27;amore, viola d&#x27;amore, trumpets, horns and timpani. See: List of cantatas by Christoph Graupner.

==Classical and romantic period==

The term &quot;cantata&quot; came to be applied almost exclusively to choral works, as distinguished from solo vocal music. In early 19th-century cantatas, the chorus is the vehicle for music more lyric and songlike than in oratorio, not excluding the possibility of a brilliant climax in a fugue as in Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Der glorreiche Augenblick, Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s &quot;Jubel-Kantate&quot;, and Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Die erste Walpurgisnacht&quot;. Anton Bruckner composed several Name-day cantatas, a Festive Cantata and two secular cantatas (&quot;Germanenzug&quot; and &quot;Helgoland&quot;). Bruckner&#x27;s Psalm 146 is also in cantata form. Mendelssohn&#x27;s Symphony Cantata, the &quot;Lobgesang&quot;, is a hybrid work, partly in the oratorio style. It is preceded by three symphonic movements, a device avowedly suggested by Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony; but the analogy is not accurate, as Beethoven&#x27;s work is a symphony of which the fourth movement is a choral finale of essentially single design, whereas Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Symphony Cantata&quot; is a cantata with three symphonic preludes. The full lyric possibilities of a string of choral songs were realized by Johannes Brahms in his &quot;Rinaldo&quot;, which, like the &quot;Walpurgisnacht&quot;—was set to a text by Goethe. Other cantatas, Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Meeresstille&quot;, works of Brahms and many notable small English choral works, such as cantatas of John Henry Maunder and John Stanley, find various ways to set poetry to choral music. The competition for the French requires that each candidate submit a cantata. Hector Berlioz failed in three attempts before finally winning in 1830 with &quot;Sardanapale&quot;. While almost all of the cantatas have long since been forgotten (along with their composers, for the most part), Debussy&#x27;s prize-winning &quot;L&#x27;enfant prodigue&quot; (1884, following his unsuccessful &quot;Le gladiateur&quot; of 1883) is still performed occasionally today. Late in the century, Gustav Mahler wrote his early &quot;Das klagende Lied&quot; on his own words between 1878 and 1880, and Samuel Coleridge-Taylor created a successful trilogy of cantatas, &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; between 1898 and 1900.

==Twentieth century and beyond==

Cantatas, both of the chamber variety and on a grand scale, were composed after 1900 as well. Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to claim that one of the most popular pieces of classical music of the 20th century to the layman&#x27;s ears, is a cantata, namely &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; (1935–1936) by the German composer Carl Orff.

In the early part of the century, secular cantatas once again became prominent, while the 19th-century tradition of sacred cantatas also continued. Ralph Vaughan Williams composed both kinds: &quot;festival&quot; cantatas such as &quot;Toward the Unknown Region&quot; (1907), &quot;Five Mystical Songs&quot; (1911), and &quot;Five Tudor Portraits&quot; (1936), and sacred cantatas including &quot;Sancta civitas&quot; (1926), &quot;Benedicite&quot; (1930), &quot;Dona nobis pacem&quot; (1936), and &quot;Hodie&quot; (1954). Joseph Ryelandt also composed secular and sacred cantatas, such as &quot;Le chant de la pauvreté&quot; Op. 92 in 1928 and &quot;Veni creator&quot; Op. 123 in 1938. Béla Bartók composed the secular &quot;Cantata Profana&quot;, subtitled &quot;The Nine Splendid Stags&quot; and based on a Romanian folk tale, in 1930. Although it began as a song cycle (as reflected also by its title), Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot; (1900–1903/1910–11) evolved into one of the century&#x27;s largest secular cantatas. Paul Hindemith composed three works he designated as cantatas: &quot;Die Serenaden&quot;, Op. 35, for soprano, oboe, viola, and cello (1924), &quot;Mahnung an die Jugend, sich der Musik zu befleissigen&quot; (from the &quot;Plöner Musiktage&quot;, 1932), and &quot;Ite angeli veloces&quot; for alto and tenor, mixed chorus, and orchestra, with audience participation (1953–55). Of Anton Webern&#x27;s last three compositions, two are secular cantatas: Cantata No. 1, Op. 29 (1938–39), and Cantata No. 2, Op. 31 (1941–43), both setting texts by Hildegard Jone. Webern had begun sketching a Third Cantata by the time he was killed in 1945. Ernst Krenek also composed two examples: a &quot;scenic cantata&quot;, &quot;Die Zwingburg&quot;, Op. 14 (1922), and a &quot;Cantata for Wartime&quot;, Op. 95, for women&#x27;s voices and orchestra (1943). Sergei Prokofiev composed &quot;Semero ikh&quot; (1917–18; rev. 1933), and in 1939 premiered a cantata drawn from the film music for &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;. He wrote two festival cantatas, the &quot;Cantata for the Twentieth Anniversary of the October Revolution&quot;, Op. 74, and &quot;Flourish, Mighty Homeland&quot;, Op. 114, for the thirtieth anniversary of the same event

Patriotic cantatas celebrating anniversaries of events in the Revolution or extolling state leaders were frequently commissioned in the Soviet Union between 1930 and the middle of the century, though these occasional works were seldom among their composers&#x27; best. Examples include Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s &quot;Poem of the Motherland&quot;, Op. 47 (1947) and &quot;The Sun Shines over Our Motherland&quot;, Op. 90 (1952), and three works by Prokofiev, &quot;Zdravitsa!&quot; [Hail to Stalin] (1939). Dmitry Kabalevsky also composed four such cantatas, &quot;The Great Homeland&quot;, Op. 35 (1941–42), &quot;The Song of Morning, Spring and Peace&quot;, Op. 57 (1957–58), &quot;Leninists&quot;, Op. 63 (1959), and &quot;About Our Native Land&quot;, Op. 82 (1965).

In 1940, the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos created a secular cantata titled &quot;Mandu çarará&quot;, based on an Indian legend collected by Barbosa Rodrigues. Francis Poulenc composed in 1943 &quot;Figure humaine&quot;, FP 120, a cantata for double mixed choir of 12 voices on poems by Paul Éluard. Igor Stravinsky composed a work titled simply &quot;Cantata&quot; in 1951–52, which used stanzas from the 15th-century &quot;Lyke-wake Dirge&quot; as a narrative frame for other anonymous English lyrics, and later designated &quot;A Sermon, a Narrative and a Prayer&quot; (1961) as &quot;a cantata for alto and tenor soli, speaker, chorus, and orchestra&quot;. Luigi Nono wrote &quot;Il canto sospeso&quot; in 1955–56. Hans Werner Henze composed a &quot;Cantata della fiaba estrema&quot; and &quot;Novae de infinito laudes&quot; (both in 1963), as well as a number of other works that might be regarded as cantatas, such as &quot;Kammermusik&quot; (1958, rev. 1963), &quot;Muzen Siziliens&quot; (1966), and &quot;El Cimarrón&quot; (1969–70). &quot;Momente&quot; (1962–64/1969), one of the most important works of Karlheinz Stockhausen, is often described as a cantata. Benjamin Britten composed at least six works he designated as cantatas: &quot;The Company of Heaven&quot; (1937), &quot;Rejoice in the Lamb&quot;, Op. 30 (1943), &quot;Saint Nicolas&quot;, Op. 42 (1949), the &quot;Cantata academica&quot;, Op. 62 (1959), the &quot;Cantata Misericordium&quot;, Op. 69 (1963), and &quot;Phaedra&quot;, Op. 93 (1975). Alberto Ginastera also composed three works in this form: the &quot;Cantata para América Mágica&quot;, Op. 27 (1960), &quot;Bomarzo&quot;, Op. 32 (1964), and &quot;Milena&quot;, Op. 37 (1971), and Gottfried von Einem composed in 1973 &quot;An die Nachgeborenen&quot; based on diverse texts, the title taken from a poem of Bertolt Brecht. Mikis Theodorakis composed the cantatas &quot;According to the Sadducees&quot; and &quot;Canto Olympico&quot;. Herbert Blendinger&#x27;s &quot;Media in vita&quot; was premiered in 1980, his &quot;Mich ruft zuweilen eine Stille&quot; (Sometimes a silence calls me) in (1992), and &quot;Allein den Betern kann es noch gelingen&quot; (It can only be achieved by those who pray) in 1995. Iván Erőd wrote in 1988/89) &quot;Vox Lucis&quot; (Voice of the Light), Op. 56. Ivan Moody wrote in 1995 &quot;Revelation&quot;.

Cantatas were also composed by Mark Alburger, Erik Bergman, Dave Brubeck, Carlos Chávez, Osvald Chlubna, Peter Maxwell Davies, Norman Dello Joio, Lukas Foss, Roy Harris, Arthur Honegger, Alan Hovhaness, Dmitry Kabalevsky, Libby Larsen, Jón Leifs, Peter Mennin, Dimitri Nicolau, Krzysztof Penderecki, Allan Pettersson, Daniel Pinkham, Earl Robinson, Ned Rorem, William Schuman (&quot;A Free Song&quot;), Roger Sessions, Siegfried Strohbach, Michael Tippett, Kurt Weill, Jörg Widmann (&quot;Kantate&quot;, &quot;Cantata in tempore belli&quot;) and (&quot;Christmas Cantata&quot;).

<text>The metric system is a system of measurement that standardizes a set of base units and a nomenclature for describing relatively large and small quantities via decimal-based multiplicative unit prefixes. Though the rules governing the metric system have changed over time, the modern definition, the International System of Units (SI), defines the metric prefixes and seven base units: metre (m), kilogram (kg), second (s), ampere (A), kelvin (K), mole (mol), and candela (cd).

An SI derived unit is a named combination of base units such as hertz (cycles per second), newton (kg⋅m/s2), and tesla (1 kg⋅s−2⋅A−1) and in the case of Celsius a shifted scale from Kelvin. Certain units have been officially accepted for use with the SI. Some of these are decimalised, like the litre and electronvolt, and are considered &quot;metric&quot;. Others, like the astronomical unit are not. Ancient non-metric but SI-accepted multiples of time, minute and hour, are base 60 (sexagesimal). Similarly, the angular measure degree and submultiples, 
arcminute, and arcsecond, are also sexagesimal and SI-accepted.

The SI system derives from the older metre, kilogram, second (MKS) system of units, though the definition of the base units has evolved over time. Today, all base units are defined by physical constants; not by example as physical objects as they were in the past.

Other metric system variants include the centimetre–gram–second system of units, the metre–tonne–second system of units, and the gravitational metric system. Each has unaffiliated metric units. Some of these systems are still used in limited contexts.

==Adoption==
The SI system has been adopted as the official system of weights and measures by most countries in the world.

A notable outlier is the United States (US). Although used in some contexts, the US has resisted full adoption; continuing to use &quot;a conglomeration of basically incoherent measurement systems&quot;.

Adopting the metric system is known as metrication.

==Multiplicative prefixes==
In the SI system and generally in older metric systems, multiples and fractions of a unit can be described via a prefix on a unit name that implies a decimal (base-10), multiplicative factor. The only exceptions are for the SI-accepted units of time (minute and hour) and angle (degree, arcminute, arcsecond) which, based on ancient convention, use base-60 multipliers.

The prefix &quot;kilo&quot;, for example, implies a factor of 1000 (103), and the prefix &quot;milli&quot; implies a factor of 1/1000 (10−3). Thus, a &quot;kilometre&quot; is a thousand metres, and a &quot;milligram&quot; is one thousandth of a gram. These relations can be written symbolically as:

==Base units==

The decimalised system is based on the metre, which had been introduced in France in the 1790s. The historical development of these systems culminated in the definition of the International System of Units (SI) in the mid-20th century, under the oversight of an international standards body.

The historical evolution of metric systems has resulted in the recognition of several principles. A set of independent dimensions of nature is selected, in terms of which all natural quantities can be expressed, called base quantities. For each of these dimensions, a representative quantity is defined as a base unit of measure. The definition of base units has increasingly been realised in terms of fundamental natural phenomena, in preference to copies of physical artefacts. A unit derived from the base units is used for expressing quantities of dimensions that can be derived from the base dimensions of the system—e.g., the square metre is the derived unit for area, which is derived from length. These derived units are coherent, which means that they involve only products of powers of the base units, without any further factors. For any given quantity whose unit has a name and symbol, an extended set of smaller and larger units is defined that are related by factors of powers of ten. The unit of time should be the second; the unit of length should be either the metre or a decimal multiple of it; and the unit of mass should be the gram or a decimal multiple of it.

Metric systems have evolved since the 1790s, as science and technology have evolved, in providing a single universal measuring system. Before and in addition to the SI, other metric systems include: the MKS system of units and the MKSA systems, which are the direct forerunners of the SI; the centimetre–gram–second (CGS) system and its subtypes, the CGS electrostatic (cgs-esu) system, the CGS electromagnetic (cgs-emu) system, and their still-popular blend, the Gaussian system; the metre–tonne–second (MTS) system; and the gravitational metric systems, which can be based on either the metre or the centimetre, and either the gram, gram-force, kilogram or kilogram-force.

==Attributes==

===Ease of learning and use===
The metric system is intended to be easy to use and widely applicable, including units based on the natural world, decimal ratios, prefixes for multiples and sub-multiples, and a structure of base and derived units.

It is a coherent system with derived units built from base units using logical rather than empirical relationships and with multiples and submultiples of both units based on decimal factors and identified by a common set of prefixes.

===Extensibility===
The metric system is extensible since the governing body reviews, modifies and extends it needs arise. For example, the katal, a derived unit for catalytic activity equivalent to one mole per second (1 mol/s), was added in 1999.

=== Realisation ===
The base units used in a measurement system must be realisable. To that end, the definition of each SI base unit is accompanied by a &quot;mise en pratique&quot; (practical realisation) that describes at least one way that the unit can be measured. Where possible, definitions of the base units were developed so that any laboratory equipped with proper instruments would be able to realise a standard without reliance on an artefact held by another country. In practice, such realisation is done under the auspices of a mutual acceptance arrangement.

In 1791 the commission originally defined the metre based on the size of the earth, equal to one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole. In the SI, the standard metre is now defined as exactly of the distance that light travels in a second. The metre can be realised by measuring the length that a light wave travels in a given time, or equivalently by measuring the wavelength of light of a known frequency.

The kilogram was originally defined as the mass of one cubic decimetre of water at 4 °C, standardised as the mass of a man-made artefact of platinum–iridium held in a laboratory in France, which was used until a new definition was introduced in May 2019. Replicas made in 1879 at the time of the artefact&#x27;s fabrication and distributed to signatories of the Metre Convention serve as &quot;de facto&quot; standards of mass in those countries. Additional replicas have been fabricated since as additional countries have joined the convention. The replicas were subject to periodic validation by comparison to the original, called the IPK. It became apparent that either the IPK or the replicas or both were deteriorating, and are no longer comparable: they had diverged by 50 μg since fabrication, so figuratively, the accuracy of the kilogram was no better than 5 parts in a hundred million or a relative accuracy of . The revision of the SI replaced the IPK with an exact definition of the Planck constant as expressed in SI units, which defines the kilogram in terms of fundamental constants.

=== Base and derived unit structure ===
A base quantity is one of a conventionally chosen subset of physical quantities, where no quantity in the subset can be expressed in terms of the others. A base unit is a unit adopted for expressing a base quantity. A derived unit is used for expressing any other quantity, and is a product of powers of base units. For example, in the modern metric system, length has the unit metre and time has the unit second, and speed has the derived unit metre per second. Density, or mass per unit volume, has the unit kilogram per cubic metre.

=== Decimal ratios ===
A significant characteristic of the metric system is its use of decimal multiples powers of 10. For example, a length that is significantly longer or shorter than 1 metre can be represented in units that are a power of 10 or 1000 metres. This differs from many older systems in which the ratio of different units varied. For example, 12 inches is one foot, but the larger unit in the same system, the mile is not a power of 12 feet. It is 5,280 feet which is hard to remember for many.

In the early days, multipliers that were positive powers of ten were given Greek-derived prefixes such as &quot;kilo-&quot; and &quot;mega-&quot;, and those that were negative powers of ten were given Latin-derived prefixes such as &quot;centi-&quot; and &quot;milli-&quot;. However, 1935 extensions to the prefix system did not follow this convention: the prefixes &quot;nano-&quot; and &quot;micro-&quot;, for example have Greek roots. During the 19th century the prefix &quot;myria-&quot;, derived from the Greek word μύριοι (&quot;mýrioi&quot;), was used as a multiplier for .

When applying prefixes to derived units of area and volume that are expressed in terms of units of length squared or cubed, the square and cube operators are applied to the unit of length including the prefix, as illustrated below.
For the most part, the metric prefixes are used uniformly for SI base, derived and accepted units. A notable exception is that for a large measure of seconds, the non-SI units of minute, hour and day are customary instead. Units of duration longer than a day are problematic since both month and year have varying number of days. Sub-second measures are often indicated via submultiple prefixes. For example, millisecond.

=== Coherence ===
Each variant of the metric system has a degree of coherence—the derived units are directly related to the base units without the need for intermediate conversion factors. For example, in a coherent system the units of force, energy, and power are chosen so that the equations

hold without the introduction of unit conversion factors. Once a set of coherent units has been defined, other relationships in physics that use this set of units will automatically be true. Therefore, Einstein&#x27;s mass–energy equation, , does not require extraneous constants when expressed in coherent units.

The CGS system had two units of energy, the erg that was related to mechanics and the calorie that was related to thermal energy; so only one of them (the erg) could bear a coherent relationship to the base units. Coherence was a design aim of SI, which resulted in only one unit of energy being defined – the joule.

=== Rationalisation ===
Maxwell&#x27;s equations of electromagnetism contained a factor of formula_1 relating to steradians, representative of the fact that electric charges and magnetic fields may be considered to emanate from a point and propagate equally in all directions, i.e. spherically. This factor made equations more awkward than necessary, and so Oliver Heaviside suggested adjusting the system of units to remove it.

==Everyday notions==
The basic units of the metric system have always represented commonplace quantities or relationships in nature; even with modern refinements of definition and methodology. In cases where laboratory precision may not be required or available, or where approximations are good enough, the commonplace notions may suffice.

===Time===
The second is readily determined from the Earth&#x27;s rotation period. Unlike other units, time multiples are not decimal. A second is of a minute, which is of an hour, which is of a day, so a second is of a day.

===Length===
The length of the equator is close to (more precisely ). In fact, the dimensions of our planet were used by the French Academy in the original definition of the metre. A dining tabletop is typically about 0.75 metres high. A very tall human is about 2 metres tall.

===Mass===
A 1-euro coin weighs 7.5 g; a Sacagawea US 1-dollar coin weighs 8.1 g; a UK 50-pence coin weighs 8.0 g.

===Temperature===
In every day use, Celsius is more commonly used than Kelvin, however a temperature difference of one Kelvin is the same as one degree Celsius and that is defined as of the temperature differential between the freezing and boiling points of water at sea level. A temperature in Kelvin is the temperature in Celsius plus about 273. Human body temperature is about 37 °C or 310 K.

===Length, mass, volume relationship===
The mass of a litre of cold water is 1 kilogram. 1 millilitre of water occupies 1 cubic centimetre and weighs 1 gram.

===Candela and Watt relationship===
Candela is about the luminous intensity of a moderately bright candle, or 1 candle power. A 60 Watt tungsten-filament incandescent light bulb has a luminous intensity of about 800 lumens which is radiated equally in all directions (i.e. 4 steradians), thus is equal to .

===Watt, Volt and Ampere relationship===
A 60 W incandescent light bulb consumes 0.5 A at 120 V (US mains voltage). A 60 W bulb rated at 230 V (European mains voltage) consumes 0.26 A at this voltage. This is evident from the formula .

===Mole and mass relationship===
A mole of a substance has a mass that is its molecular mass expressed in units of grams. The mass of a mole of carbon is 12.0 g, and the mass of a mole of table salt is 58.4 g.

Since all gases have the same volume per mole at a given temperature and pressure far from their points of liquefaction and solidification (see Perfect gas), and air is about oxygen (molecular mass 32) and nitrogen (molecular mass 28), the density of any near-perfect gas relative to air can be obtained to a good approximation by dividing its molecular mass by 29 (because ). For example, carbon monoxide (molecular mass 28) has almost the same density as air.

==History==
The French Revolution (1789–99) enabled France to reform its many outdated systems of various local weights and measures. In 1790, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord proposed a new system based on natural units to the French National Assembly, aiming for global adoption. With the United Kingdom not responding to a request to collaborate in the development of the system, the French Academy of Sciences established a commission to implement this new standard alone, and in 1799, the new system was launched in France.

A number of different metric systems have been developed, all using the &quot;Mètre des Archives&quot; and &quot;Kilogramme des Archives&quot; (or their descendants) as their base units, but differing in the definitions of the various derived units.

=== 19th century ===
In 1832, Gauss used the astronomical second as a base unit in defining the gravitation of the Earth, and together with the milligram and millimetre, this became the first system of mechanical units. He showed that the strength of a magnet could also be quantified in terms of these units, by measuring the oscillations of a magnetised needle and finding the quantity of &quot;magnetic fluid&quot; that produces an acceleration of one unit when applied to a unit mass. The centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS) was the first coherent metric system, having been developed in the 1860s and promoted by Maxwell and Thomson. In 1874, this system was formally promoted by the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS). The system&#x27;s characteristics are that density is expressed in , force expressed in dynes and mechanical energy in ergs. Thermal energy was defined in calories, one calorie being the energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water from 15.5 °C to 16.5 °C. The meeting also recognised two sets of units for electrical and magnetic properties – the electrostatic set of units and the electromagnetic set of units.

The CGS units of electricity were cumbersome to work with. This was remedied at the 1893 International Electrical Congress held in Chicago by defining the &quot;international&quot; ampere and ohm using definitions based on the metre, kilogram and second, in the International System of Electrical and Magnetic Units. During the same period in which the CGS system was being extended to include electromagnetism, other systems were developed, distinguished by their choice of coherent base unit, including the Practical System of Electric Units, or QES (quad–eleventhgram–second) system, was being used. Here, the base units are the quad, equal to (approximately a quadrant of the Earth&#x27;s circumference), the eleventhgram, equal to , and the second. These were chosen so that the corresponding electrical units of potential difference, current and resistance had a convenient magnitude.

=== 20th century ===
In 1901, Giovanni Giorgi showed that by adding an electrical unit as a fourth base unit, the various anomalies in electromagnetic systems could be resolved. The metre–kilogram–second–coulomb (MKSC) and metre–kilogram–second–ampere (MKSA) systems are examples of such systems.

The metre–tonne–second system of units (MTS) was based on the metre, tonne and second – the unit of force was the sthène and the unit of pressure was the pièze. It was invented in France for industrial use and from 1933 to 1955 was used both in France and in the Soviet Union. Gravitational metric systems use the kilogram-force (kilopond) as a base unit of force, with mass measured in a unit known as the hyl, &quot;Technische Masseneinheit&quot; (TME), mug or metric slug. Although the CGPM passed a resolution in 1901 defining the standard value of acceleration due to gravity to be 980.665 cm/s2, gravitational units are not part of the International System of Units (SI).

===Current===
The International System of Units is the modern metric system. It is based on the metre–kilogram–second–ampere (MKSA) system of units from early in the 20th century. It also includes numerous coherent derived units for common quantities like power (watt) and irradience (lumen). Electrical units were taken from the International system then in use. Other units like those for energy (joule) were modelled on those from the older CGS system, but scaled to be coherent with MKSA units. Two additional base units – the &quot;kelvin&quot;, which is equivalent to degree Celsius for change in thermodynamic temperature but set so that 0 K is absolute zero, and the &quot;candela&quot;, which is roughly equivalent to the international candle unit of illumination – were introduced. Later, another base unit, the &quot;mole&quot;, a unit of amount of substance equivalent to the Avogadro number number of specified molecules, was added along with several other derived units.

The system was promulgated by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (French: &quot;Conférence générale des poids et mesures&quot; – CGPM) in 1960. At that time, the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of a spectral line of the krypton-86 atom (krypton-86 being a stable isotope of an inert gas that occurs in undetectable or trace amounts naturally), and the standard metre artefact from 1889 was retired.

Today, the International system of units consists of 7 base units and innumerable coherent derived units including 22 with special names. The last new derived unit, the &quot;katal&quot; for catalytic activity, was added in 1999. All the base units except the second are now defined in terms of exact and invariant constants of physics or mathematics, barring those parts of their definitions which are dependent on the second itself. As a consequence, the speed of light has now become an exactly defined constant, and defines the metre as of the distance light travels in a second. The kilogram was defined by a cylinder of platinum-iridium alloy until a new definition in terms of natural physical constants was adopted in 2019. As of 2022, the range of decimal prefixes has been extended to those for 1030 (&quot;quetta–&quot;) and 10−30 (&quot;quecto–&quot;).

<text>The interquartile mean (IQM) (or midmean) is a statistical measure of central tendency based on the truncated mean of the interquartile range. The IQM is very similar to the scoring method used in sports that are evaluated by a panel of judges: &quot;discard the lowest and the highest scores; calculate the mean value of the remaining scores&quot;.

==Calculation==
In calculation of the IQM, only the data between the first and third quartiles is used, and the lowest 25% and the highest 25% of the data are discarded.

:formula_1
assuming the values have been ordered.

==Examples==

===Dataset size divisible by four===
The method is best explained with an example. Consider the following dataset:

:5, 8, 4, 38, 8, 6, 9, 7, 7, 3, 1, 6

First sort the list from lowest-to-highest:

:1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 38

There are 12 observations (datapoints) in the dataset, thus we have 4 quartiles of 3 numbers. Discard the lowest and the highest 3 values:

:1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 38

We now have 6 of the 12 observations remaining; next, we calculate the arithmetic mean of these numbers:

:&quot;x&quot;IQM = (5 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 8) / 6 = 6.5

This is the interquartile mean.

For comparison, the arithmetic mean of the original dataset is

:(5 + 8 + 4 + 38 + 8 + 6 + 9 + 7 + 7 + 3 + 1 + 6) / 12 = 8.5

due to the strong influence of the outlier, 38.

===Dataset size not divisible by four===
The above example consisted of 12 observations in the dataset, which made the determination of the quartiles very easy. Of course, not all datasets have a number of observations that is divisible by 4. We can adjust the method of calculating the IQM to accommodate this. So ideally we want to have the IQM equal to the mean for symmetric distributions, e.g.:

:1, 2, 3, 4, 5

has a mean value &quot;x&quot;mean = 3, and since it is a symmetric distribution, &quot;x&quot;IQM = 3 would be desired.

We can solve this by using a weighted average of the quartiles and the interquartile dataset:

Consider the following dataset of 9 observations:

:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17

There are 9/4 = 2.25 observations in each quartile, and 4.5 observations in the interquartile range. Truncate the fractional quartile size, and remove this number from the 1st and 4th quartiles (2.25 observations in each quartile, thus the lowest 2 and the highest 2 are removed).

:1, 3, (5), 7, 9, 11, (13), 15, 17

Thus, there are 3 &quot;full&quot; observations in the interquartile range with a weight of 1 for each full observation, and 2 fractional observations with each observation having a weight of 0.75 (1-0.25 = 0.75). Thus we have a total of 4.5 observations in the interquartile range, (3×1 + 2×0.75 = 4.5 observations).

The IQM is now calculated as follows:

:&quot;x&quot;IQM = {(7 + 9 + 11) + 0.75 × (5 + 13)} / 4.5 = 9

In the above example, the mean has a value xmean = 9. The same as the IQM, as was expected. The method of calculating the IQM for any number of observations is analogous; the fractional contributions to the IQM can be either 0, 0.25, 0.50, or 0.75.

==Comparison with mean and median==
The interquartile mean shares some properties of both the mean and the median:

*Like the median, the IQM is insensitive to outliers; in the example given, the highest value (38) was an obvious outlier of the dataset, but its value is not used in the calculation of the IQM. On the other hand, the common average (the arithmetic mean) is sensitive to these outliers: &quot;x&quot;mean = 8.5.
*Like the mean, the IQM is a distinct parameter, based on a large number of observations from the dataset. The median is always equal to &quot;one&quot; of the observations in the dataset (assuming an odd number of observations). The mean can be equal to &quot;any&quot; value between the lowest and highest observation, depending on the value of &quot;all&quot; the other observations. The IQM can be equal to &quot;any&quot; value between the first and third quartiles, depending on &quot;all&quot; the observations in the interquartile range.

===Applications===
*London Interbank Offered Rate estimated a reference interest rate as the interquartile mean of the rates offered by several banks. (SOFR, Libor&#x27;s primary US replacement, uses a volume-weighted average price which is not robust.)
*Everything2 uses the interquartile mean of the reputations of a user&#x27;s writeups to determine the quality of the user&#x27;s contribution.

<doc id="44153" wikidata="Q6407093" url="?curid=44153" title="Kill Doctor Lucky">
<text>Kill Doctor Lucky is a humorous board game designed by James Ernest and released in 1996 by Cheapass Games. In 1998, &quot;Kill Doctor Lucky&quot; won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Abstract Board Game of 1997&quot;.

&quot;Kill Doctor Lucky&quot; is, in concept, a sort of inversion and perhaps a parody of &quot;Cluedo&quot; (&quot;Clue&quot; in North America). Both games are set in a sprawling mansion full of colorfully named rooms, feature a variety of dangerous weapons, and deal with the murder of the mansion&#x27;s owner. &quot;Cluedo&quot; begins after the murder has been committed, and players compete to solve it; &quot;Kill Doctor Lucky&quot; ends with the murder, and players compete to commit it.

In October 2015 a &quot;Deluxe 19.5th Anniversary Edition&quot; with new art and updated game mechanics was launched on Kickstarter.

==Gameplay==

The gameboard is a floor plan of Doctor Lucky&#x27;s mansion, and it is accompanied by a deck of cards representing the objects and opportunities that can be found there. Players take turns moving through the rooms of the mansion and accumulating cards, while Doctor Lucky moves through the mansion following a predetermined path. A player may attempt to kill Doctor Lucky by playing a weapon card (such as a runcible spoon, a monkey hand, a letter opener, a trowel, a chainsaw or pinking shears) while the player&#x27;s token is in the same room as Doctor Lucky and out of sight of all other players. Each weapon card has a certain point value, and certain weapons are worth more points when used in certain rooms (for example, the trowel is worth extra points when used in the wine cellar, an allusion to Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot;).

At this point, the player making the murder attempt succeeds, and thereby wins the game, unless the opponents play Failure cards of combined value equal to the value of the weapon used. The situation is complicated by the requirement that players play Failure cards in clockwise order, with each player having only one opportunity to play cards. Since it is to any player&#x27;s advantage to eliminate failure cards from his opponents&#x27; hands, a large part of the strategy of the game consists in bluffing: when one player attacks Doctor Lucky, it is in your interest to persuade your other opponents that you have no failure cards in your hand, to attempt to force them to save the game by spending the required cards.

When played, failure cards are set aside and not returned to the deck. Thus, as the game goes on, fewer and fewer failure cards are in play. This not only builds tension but also forces the game to end in a reasonable amount of time, because once all the failure cards are gone, the next murder attempt cannot fail.

The new Titanic Games version of &quot;Kill Doctor Lucky&quot; makes two changes to the original rules. First, a minor change was made to game play that now allows everyone to take at least one turn before the Doctor Lucky pawn determines turn order. In the original, it was possible for players to position themselves in such a way as to keep some players from ever getting a turn. This is no longer possible.

The second change was the addition of a new game piece called the &quot;spite token&quot; (a variant in the prior edition). Spite tokens are awarded when a murder attempt fails and adds a bonus point to all future murder attempts. A player also has the option to spend a spite token as a failure point to aid in thwarting an opponent&#x27;s murder attempt. When spite tokens are spent in this manner they are given to the player they&#x27;re spent against. This speeds the game up and adds a great deal of strategy to the late game when all of the failure cards have been removed from the deck.

As of the 19.5th Anniversary Edition, several rules have changed. If the deck runs out, the lights go out and line of sight is in-the-same-room only; a player may not draw a card if anyone, including Doctor Lucky, can see them; and hallways and stairs do not count against movement, making the board much smaller.

== Expansions and spinoffs ==
;&quot;Kill Doctor Lucky: Craigdarroch: An Accessory to Murder&quot; (1998): An expansion board for &quot;Kill Doctor Lucky, Craigdarroch&quot; depicts Craigdarroch Castle, a mansion in Victoria, British Columbia.
;&quot;Save Doctor Lucky&quot; (2000): A prequel to &quot;Kill Doctor Lucky, Save Doctor Lucky&quot; takes place on a sinking ocean liner. Gameplay is similar to &quot;Kill Doctor Lucky&quot;, except that your goal is to &quot;save&quot; Doctor Lucky while somebody else &quot;is&quot; watching. There is also a time limit; if Doctor Lucky is not saved before the ship sinks, everybody loses.
;&quot;Save Doctor Lucky on Moon Base Copernicus&quot; (2002): A new map for &quot;Save Doctor Lucky&quot; depicting an &quot;unexplodable&quot; space station. Typically, they called it unexplodable but it&#x27;s about to go BOOM! The escape pod only has room for two, so, it looks like you&#x27;ll get into Dr. Lucky&#x27;s good-books by saving him and taking him back to Earth with you, while the rest of your unfortunate travellers are killed in the explosion.
;&quot;Kill Doctor Lucky: The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; (2002): Contains the original board for &quot;Kill Doctor Lucky&quot; and an unnamed, back-printed second board similar to the Craigdarroch expansion board. The rule booklet for this edition also includes suggested variant rules, including &quot;Kill Doctor Lucky and his Dog&quot; (in this version, one can kill Doctor Lucky&#x27;s dog in front of him, but not vice versa) and a system for players to try to kill each other (resulting in the killer taking the victim&#x27;s cards, and the victim going back to the starting space and continuing from there).
;&quot;Kill Doctor Lucky Online&quot; (2004): A complete, licensed online version of the classic &quot;Kill Doctor Lucky&quot; game published by GameTable Online. Can be played with live players or against computer opponents.
;&quot;The Doctor Lucky Ambivalence Pack&quot; (2005): Includes &quot;Kill Doctor Lucky Aboard the SS Afgang!&quot; and &quot;Save Doctor Lucky from the Hotel DuBois!&quot; expansion boards.
;&quot;Kill Doctor Lucky&quot; (2006): A new full-color deluxe edition, including mounted board, cards, pawns, rules, and the new spite tokens published by Titanic Games.
;&quot;Kill Doctor Lucky and His Little Dog, Too!&quot; (2007): Expansion set from Titanic Games for the above game. Adds a token for Shamrock, the Doctor&#x27;s dog, and expansion rules.
;&quot;Get Lucky&quot; (2013): Card game version from Cheapass Games. Published through Kickstarter.
;&quot;The Secret Lair of Doctor Lucky&quot; (2016): An expansion board for the 19.5th Edition illustrated in the same style as &quot;Before I Kill You, Mr. Spy&quot;. Rules Twist: You &quot;must&quot; be seen killing Doctor Lucky.
;&quot;Dr. Lucky&#x27;s Mansion that is Haunted&quot; (2017): An expansion board for the 19.5th Edition based on the concept of Dr. Lucky&#x27;s mansion being haunted, dodgingly renamed to avoid another &#x27;Spy Game&#x27; incident. Rules Twist: You play ghosts and move through the walls.
&quot;&#x27;Button Men: Dr. Lucky&#x27;s Murderers&quot; (2018): A Button Men set featuring Dr. Lucky and several potential murders. Introduces the Luck Die skill and the 19.5 sized die.

== Other notes ==
*The Failure-card mechanic is a prime example of the game theory concept of the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, to the extent that it has become known among many gamers as &quot;Kill Doctor Lucky Syndrome&quot;.
*The &quot;Craigdarroch&quot; expansion to the game was unavailable for a brief time after the current owners of the castle objected to the use of the estate&#x27;s name and floor plan without permission. The expansion is now available in an edited form as part of &quot;Kill Doctor Lucky: The Director&#x27;s Cut (2002).&quot; (A similar debate caused Cheapass Games to repackage their game &quot;Before I Kill You, Mr. Bond&quot; as &quot;James Ernest&#x27;s Totally Renamed Spy Game.&quot;)
*&quot;Kill Doctor Lucky&quot; is also featured on &quot;The Cheapass Album&quot; by Beatnik Turtle.

<text>Catherine de&#x27; Medici (, ; , ; 13 April 1519 – 5 January 1589) was an Italian (Florentine) noblewoman born into the Medici family. She was Queen of France from 1547 to 1559 by marriage to King Henry II and the mother of French kings Francis II, Charles IX, and Henry III. She was also the niece of Pope Clement VII. The years during which her sons reigned have been called &quot;the age of Catherine de&#x27; Medici&quot; since she had extensive, albeit at times varying, influence on the political life of France.

Catherine was born in Florence to Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Urbino, and Madeleine de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne. In 1533, at the age of 14, Catherine married Henry, the second son of King Francis I and Queen Claude of France, who would become Dauphin of France upon the death of his elder brother Francis in 1536. Catherine&#x27;s marriage was arranged by her uncle Pope Clement VII (Giulio de&#x27; Medici). During his reign, Henry excluded Catherine from state affairs, instead showering favours on his chief mistress, Diane de Poitiers, who wielded much influence over him. Henry&#x27;s sudden accidental death in 1559 thrust Catherine into the political arena as mother of the frail 15-year-old FrancisII. When FrancisII died in 1560, she became regent on behalf of her 10-year-old son CharlesIX and thus gained sweeping powers. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine played a key role in the reign of her third son, HenryIII. He dispensed with her advice only in the last months of her life but outlived her by just seven months.

Catherine&#x27;s three sons reigned in an age of almost constant civil and religious war in France. The Guise Faction tried to displace her sons in its attempt to establish its very own dynasty to rule over France. Catherine also tried to think of ways to weaken the Guise Faction, which treated her scornfully. The problems facing the monarchy were complex and daunting. However, Catherine kept the monarchy and state institutions functioning, if at a minimal level. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Calvinist Protestants known as Huguenots. However, she failed to fully grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later, she resorted in frustration and anger to hardline policies against them. In return, she was blamed for the persecutions carried out under her sons&#x27; rules, in particular the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre of 1572, during which thousands of Huguenots were killed in France.

Some historians have excused Catherine from blame for the worst decisions of the crown, but evidence for her ruthlessness can be found in her letters. In practice, her authority was limited by the effects of the civil wars, and she suffers in comparison to what might have been had her husband the king lived to take responsibility or stabilise the country. Therefore, her policies may be seen as desperate measures to keep the House of Valois on the throne at all costs and her patronage of the arts as an attempt to glorify a monarchy whose prestige was in steep decline. Without Catherine, it is unlikely that her sons would have remained in power. Catherine has been called &quot;the most important woman in Europe&quot; in the 16th century.

==Birth and upbringing==

Catherine de&#x27; Medici was born Caterina Maria Romula de&#x27; Medici on 13 April 1519 in Florence, Republic of Florence, the only child of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Urbino, and his wife, Madeleine de la Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, the countess of Boulogne. The young couple had been married the year before at Amboise as part of the alliance between King Francis I of France and Lorenzo&#x27;s uncle Pope Leo X against the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. According to a contemporary chronicler, when Catherine was born, her parents were &quot;as pleased as if it had been a boy&quot;.

Within a month of Catherine&#x27;s birth, both her parents were dead: Madeleine died on 28 April of puerperal fever, and Lorenzo died on 4 May. King Francis wanted Catherine to be raised at the French court, but Pope Leo refused, claiming he wanted her to marry Ippolito de&#x27; Medici. Leo made Catherine Duchess of Urbino but annexed most of the Duchy of Urbino to the Papal States, permitting Florence to keep only the Fortress of San Leo. It was only after Leo&#x27;s death in 1521, that his successor, Adrian VI, restored the duchy to its rightful owner, Francesco Maria I della Rovere.

Catherine was first cared for by her paternal grandmother, Alfonsina Orsini. After Alfonsina&#x27;s death in 1520, Catherine joined her cousins and was raised by her aunt, Clarice de&#x27; Medici. The death of Pope Leo in 1521 briefly interrupted Medici power until Cardinal Giulio de&#x27; Medici was elected Pope Clement VII in 1523. Clement housed Catherine in the Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence, where she lived in state. The Florentine people called her &quot;duchessina&quot; (&quot;the little duchess&quot;), in deference to her unrecognised claim to the Duchy of Urbino.

In 1527, the Medici were overthrown in Florence by a faction opposed to the regime of Clement&#x27;s representative, Cardinal Silvio Passerini, and Catherine was taken hostage and placed in a series of convents. The final one, the was her home for three years. Mark Strage described these years as &quot;the happiest of her entire life&quot;. Clement had no choice but to crown Charles of Austria as Holy Roman Emperor in return for his help in retaking the city. In October 1529, Charles&#x27;s troops laid siege to Florence. As the siege dragged on, voices called for Catherine to be killed and exposed naked and chained to the city walls. Some even suggested that she be handed over to the troops to be raped. The city finally surrendered on 12 August 1530. Clement summoned Catherine from her beloved convent to join him in Rome where he greeted her with open arms and tears in his eyes. Then he set about the business of finding her a husband.

==Marriage==

On her visit to Rome, the Venetian envoy described Catherine as &quot;small of stature, and thin, and without delicate features, but having the protruding eyes peculiar to the Medici family&quot;. Suitors, however, lined up for her hand, including James V of Scotland who sent the Duke of Albany to Clement to conclude a marriage in April and November 1530. When Francis I of France proposed his second son, Henry, Duke of Orléans, in early 1533, Clement jumped at the offer. Henry was a prize catch for Catherine, who, despite her wealth, was of common origin.

The wedding, a grand affair marked by extravagant display and gift-giving, took place in the Église Saint-Ferréol les Augustins in Marseille on 28 October 1533. Prince Henry danced and jousted for Catherine. The fourteen-year-old couple left their wedding ball at midnight to perform their nuptial duties. Henry arrived in the bedroom with King Francis, who is said to have stayed until the marriage was consummated. He noted that &quot;each had shown valour in the joust&quot;. Clement visited the newlyweds in bed the next morning and added his blessings to the night&#x27;s proceedings.

Catherine saw little of her husband in their first year of marriage, but the ladies of the court, impressed with her intelligence and keenness to please, treated her well. However, the death of her uncle Clement on 25 September 1534 undermined Catherine&#x27;s standing in the French court. The next pope, Alessandro Farnese, was elected on 13 October and took the title Paul III. As a Farnese he felt no obligation to keep Clement&#x27;s promises, broke the alliance with Francis and refused to continue paying her huge dowry. King Francis lamented, &quot;The girl has come to me stark naked.&quot;

Prince Henry showed no interest in Catherine as a wife; instead, he openly took mistresses. For the first ten years of the marriage, the royal couple failed to produce any children together. In 1537, he had a brief affair with Philippa Duci, who gave birth to a daughter, whom he publicly acknowledged. This proved that Henry was fertile and added to the pressure on Catherine to produce a child.

===Dauphine===
 In 1536, Henry&#x27;s older brother, Francis, caught a chill after a game of tennis, contracted a fever and died shortly after, leaving Henry the heir. Suspicions of poison abounded, from Catherine to Emperor Charles V. Sebastiano de Montecuccoli confessed under torture to poisoning the Dauphin.

As dauphine, Catherine was expected to provide a future heir to the throne. According to the court chronicler Brantôme, &quot;many people advised the king and the Dauphin to repudiate her, since it was necessary to continue the line of France&quot;. Divorce was discussed. In desperation, Catherine tried every known trick for getting pregnant, such as placing cow dung and ground stags&#x27; antlers on her &quot;source of life&quot;, and drinking mule&#x27;s urine. On 19 January 1544 she at last gave birth to a son, named after King Francis.

After becoming pregnant once, Catherine had no trouble doing so again. She may have owed her change of fortune to the physician Jean Fernel, who may have noticed slight abnormalities in the couple&#x27;s sexual organs and advised them how to solve the problem. However, he denied ever providing such advice. Catherine quickly conceived again and on 2 April 1545 she bore a daughter, Elisabeth. She went on to bear Henry a further eight children, seven of whom survived infancy, including the future Charles IX (born 27 June 1550); the future Henry III (born 19 September 1551); and Francis, Duke of Anjou (born 18 March 1555), Claude (born 12 November 1547) and Margaret (born 14 May 1553). The long-term future of the Valois dynasty, which had ruled France since the 14th century, seemed assured.

However, Catherine&#x27;s ability to bear children failed to improve her marriage. About 1538, at the age of 19, Henry had taken as his mistress the 38-year-old Diane de Poitiers, whom he adored for the rest of his life. Even so, he respected Catherine&#x27;s status as his consort. When King FrancisI died on 31 March 1547, Catherine became queen consort of France. She was crowned in the Basilica of Saint-Denis on 10 June 1549.

===Queen of France===

Henry allowed Catherine almost no political influence as queen. Although she sometimes acted as regent during his absences from France, her formal powers were strictly nominal. Henry even gave the Château of Chenonceau, which Catherine had wanted for herself, to his mistress Diane de Poitiers instead, who took her place at the center of power, dispensing patronage and accepting favors. The imperial ambassador reported that in the presence of guests, Henry would sit on Diane&#x27;s lap and play the guitar, chat about politics, or fondle her breasts. Diane never regarded Catherine as a threat. She even encouraged the king to spend more time with Catherine and sire more children.

In 1556, Catherine nearly died giving birth to twin daughters, Jeanne and Victoire. Surgeons saved her life by breaking the legs of Jeanne, who died in her womb. The surviving daughter, Victoire, died seven weeks later. Because their birth very nearly cost Catherine her life, the king&#x27;s physician advised the king that there should be no more children; therefore, HenryII stopped visiting his wife&#x27;s bedroom and spent all his time with his longtime mistress, Diane de Poitiers. Catherine had no more children.

Henry&#x27;s reign enabled the rise of the Guise brothers, Charles, who became a cardinal, and Henry&#x27;s boyhood friend Francis, both of whom became Duke of Guise. Their sister Mary of Guise had married James V of Scotland in 1538 and was the mother of Mary, Queen of Scots. At the age of five and a half, Mary was brought to the French court, where she was promised to the Dauphin, Francis. Catherine brought her up with her own children at the French court, while Mary of Guise governed Scotland as her daughter&#x27;s regent.

On 3–4 April 1559 Henry signed the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis with the Holy Roman Empire and England, ending a long period of Italian Wars. The treaty was sealed by the betrothal of Catherine&#x27;s teenage daughter Elisabeth, aged 13, to Philip II of Spain. Their proxy wedding was celebrated in Paris on 22 June 1559. As part of the celebrations, a jousting tournament was held on 30 June 1559.

King Henry took part in the jousting, sporting Diane&#x27;s black-and-white colours. He defeated the dukes of Guise and Nemours, but the young Gabriel, comte de Montgomery, knocked him half out of the saddle. Henry insisted on riding against Montgomery again, and this time, Montgomery&#x27;s lance shattered in the king&#x27;s face. Henry reeled out of the clash, his face pouring blood, with splinters &quot;of a good bigness&quot; sticking out of his eye and head. Catherine, Diane, and Prince Francis all fainted. Henry was carried to the Château de Tournelles, where five splinters of wood were extracted from his head, one of which had pierced his eye and brain. Catherine stayed by his bedside, but Diane kept away, &quot;for fear&quot;, in the words of a chronicler, &quot;of being expelled by the Queen&quot;. For the next ten days, Henry&#x27;s state fluctuated. At times he even felt well enough to dictate letters and listen to music. Slowly, however, he lost his sight, speech, and reason, and on 10 July 1559, he died, aged 40. From that day, Catherine took a broken lance as her emblem, inscribed with the words &quot;lacrymae hinc, hinc dolor&quot; (&quot;from this come my tears and my pain&quot;), and wore black mourning in memory of Henry.

==Queen mother==

===Reign of Francis II===
Francis II became king at the age of fifteen. In what has been called a coup d&#x27;état, the Cardinal of Lorraine and the Duke of Guise—whose niece, Mary, Queen of Scots, had married Francis II the year before—seized power the day after HenryII&#x27;s death and quickly moved themselves into the Louvre Palace with the young couple. The English ambassador reported a few days later that &quot;the house of Guise ruleth and doth all about the French king&quot;. For the moment, Catherine worked with the Guises out of necessity. She was not strictly entitled to a role in Francis&#x27;s government, because he was deemed old enough to rule for himself. Nevertheless, all his official acts began with the words: &quot;This being the good pleasure of the Queen, my lady-mother, and I also approving of every opinion that she holdeth, am content and command that ...&quot;. Catherine did not hesitate to exploit her new authority. One of her first acts was to force Diane de Poitiers to hand over the crown jewels and return the Château de Chenonceau to the crown. She later did her best to efface or outdo Diane&#x27;s building work there.

The Guise brothers set about persecuting the Protestants with zeal. Catherine adopted a moderate stance and spoke against the Guise persecutions, though she had no particular sympathy for the Huguenots, whose beliefs she never shared. The Protestants looked for leadership first to Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre, the First Prince of the Blood, and then, with more success, to his brother, Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé, who backed a plot to overthrow the Guises by force. When the Guises heard of the plot, they moved the court to the fortified Château of Amboise. The Duke of Guise launched an attack into the woods around the château. His troops surprised the rebels and killed many of them on the spot, including the commander, La Renaudie. Others they drowned in the river or strung up around the battlements while Catherine and the court watched.

In June 1560, Michel de l&#x27;Hôpital was appointed Chancellor of France. He sought the support of France&#x27;s constitutional bodies and worked closely with Catherine to defend the law in the face of the growing anarchy. Neither saw the need to punish Protestants who worshipped in private and did not take up arms. On 20 August 1560, Catherine and the chancellor advocated this policy to an Assembly of Notables at Fontainebleau. Historians regard the occasion as an early example of Catherine&#x27;s statesmanship. Meanwhile, Condé raised an army and in autumn 1560 began attacking towns in the south. Catherine ordered him to court and had him imprisoned as soon as he arrived. He was tried in November, found guilty of offences against the crown, and sentenced to death. His life was saved by the illness and death of the king, as a result of an infection or an abscess in his ear.

When Catherine realized Francis was going to die, she made a pact with Antoine de Bourbon by which he would renounce his right to the regency of the future king, Charles IX, in return for the release of his brother Condé. As a result, when Francis died on 5 December 1560, the Privy Council appointed Catherine as governor of France (&quot;gouvernante de France&quot;), with sweeping powers. She wrote to her daughter Elisabeth: &quot;My principal aim is to have the honour of God before my eyes in all things and to preserve my authority, not for myself, but for the conservation of this kingdom and for the good of all your brothers&quot;.

===Reign of Charles IX===
Charles IX was ten years old at the time of his royal consecration, during which he cried. At first Catherine kept him very close to her, and even slept in his chamber. She presided over his council, decided policy, and controlled state business and patronage. However, she was never in a position to control the country as a whole, which was on the brink of civil war. In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and, in some ways, difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner.

She summoned church leaders from both sides to attempt to solve their doctrinal differences. Despite her optimism, the resulting Colloquy of Poissy ended in failure on 13 October 1561, dissolving itself without her permission. Catherine failed because she saw the religious divide only in political terms. In the words of historian R. J. Knecht, &quot;she underestimated the strength of religious conviction, imagining that all would be well if only she could get the party leaders to agree&quot;. In January 1562, Catherine issued the tolerant Edict of Saint-Germain in a further attempt to build bridges with the Protestants. On 1 March 1562, however, in an incident known as the Massacre of Vassy, the Duke of Guise and his men attacked worshipping Huguenots in a barn at Vassy, killing 74 and wounding 104. Guise, who called the massacre &quot;a regrettable accident&quot;, was cheered as a hero in the streets of Paris while the Huguenots called for revenge. The massacre lit the fuse that sparked the French Wars of Religion. For the next thirty years, France found itself in a state of either civil war or armed truce.

Within a month Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé, and Admiral Gaspard de Coligny had raised an army of 1,800. They formed an alliance with England and seized town after town in France. Catherine met Coligny, but he refused to back down. She therefore told him: &quot;Since you rely on your forces, we will show you ours&quot;. The royal army struck back quickly and laid siege to Huguenot-held Rouen. Catherine visited the deathbed of Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre, after he was fatally wounded by an arquebus shot. Catherine insisted on visiting the field herself and when warned of the dangers laughed, &quot;My courage is as great as yours&quot;. The Catholics took Rouen, but their triumph was short-lived. On 18 February 1563, a spy called Poltrot de Méré fired an arquebus into the back of the Duke of Guise, at the siege of Orléans. The murder triggered an aristocratic blood feud that complicated the French civil wars for years to come. Catherine, however, was delighted with the death of her ally. &quot;If Monsieur de Guise had perished sooner&quot;, she told the Venetian ambassador, &quot;peace would have been achieved more quickly&quot;. On 19 March 1563, the Edict of Amboise, also known as the Edict of Pacification, ended the war. Catherine now rallied both Huguenot and Catholic forces to retake Le Havre from the English.

====Huguenots====
On 17 August 1563, Charles IX was declared of age at the Parlement of Rouen, but he was never able to rule on his own and showed little interest in government. Catherine decided to launch a drive to enforce the Edict of Amboise and revive loyalty to the crown. To this end, she set out with Charles and the court on a progress around France that lasted from January 1564 until May 1565. Catherine held talks with Jeanne d&#x27;Albret, the Protestant queen regnant of Navarre (and the wife of Antoine de Bourbon) at Mâcon and Nérac. She also met her daughter Elisabeth at Bayonne near the Spanish border, amidst lavish court festivities. Philip II excused himself from the occasion. He sent the Duke of Alba to tell Catherine to scrap the Edict of Amboise and to find punitive solutions to the problem of heresy.

In 1566, through the ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Guillaume de Grandchamp de Grantrie, and because of a long-standing Franco-Ottoman alliance, Charles and Catherine proposed to the Ottoman Court a plan to resettle French Huguenots and French and German Lutherans in Ottoman-controlled Moldavia, in order to create a military colony and a buffer against the Habsburg. This plan also had the added advantage of removing the Huguenots from France, but it failed to interest the Ottomans.

On 27 September 1567, in a swoop known as the Surprise of Meaux, Huguenot forces attempted to ambush the king, triggering renewed civil war. Taken unawares, the court fled to Paris in disarray. The war was ended by the Peace of Longjumeau of 22–23 March 1568, but civil unrest and bloodshed continued. The Surprise of Meaux marked a turning point in Catherine&#x27;s policy towards the Huguenots. From that moment, she abandoned compromise for a policy of repression. She told the Venetian ambassador in June 1568 that all one could expect from Huguenots was deceit, and she praised the Duke of Alba&#x27;s reign of terror in the Netherlands, where Calvinists and rebels were put to death in the thousands.

The Huguenots retreated to the fortified stronghold of La Rochelle on the west coast, where Jeanne d&#x27;Albret and her fifteen-year-old son, Henry of Bourbon, joined them. &quot;We have come to the determination to die, all of us&quot;, Jeanne wrote to Catherine, &quot;rather than abandon our God, and our religion.&quot; Catherine called Jeanne, whose decision to rebel posed a dynastic threat to the Valois, &quot;the most shameless woman in the world&quot;. Nevertheless, the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, signed on 8 August 1570 because the royal army ran out of cash, conceded wider toleration to the Huguenots than ever before.

Catherine looked to further Valois interests by grand dynastic marriages. In 1570, Charles IX married Elisabeth of Austria, daughter of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. Catherine was also eager for a match between one of her two youngest sons and Elizabeth I of England. After Catherine&#x27;s daughter Elisabeth died in childbirth in 1568, she had touted her youngest daughter Margaret as a bride for Philip II of Spain. Now she sought a marriage between Margaret and Henry III of Navarre, Jeanne&#x27;s son, with the aim of uniting Valois and Bourbon interests. Margaret, however, was secretly involved with Henry of Guise, the son of the late Duke of Guise. When Catherine found this out, she had her daughter brought from her bed. Catherine and the king then beat her, ripping her nightclothes and pulling out handfuls of her hair.

Catherine pressed Jeanne d&#x27;Albret to attend court. Writing that she wanted to see Jeanne&#x27;s children, she promised not to harm them. Jeanne replied: &quot;Pardon me if, reading that, I want to laugh, because you want to relieve me of a fear that I&#x27;ve never had. I&#x27;ve never thought that, as they say, you eat little children.&quot; When Jeanne did come to court, Catherine pressured her hard, playing on Jeanne&#x27;s hopes for her beloved son. Jeanne finally agreed to the marriage between her son and Margaret, so long as Henry could remain a Huguenot. When Jeanne arrived in Paris to buy clothes for the wedding, she was taken ill and died on 9 June 1572, aged forty-three. Huguenot writers later accused Catherine of murdering her with poisoned gloves. The wedding took place on 18 August 1572 at Notre-Dame, Paris.

====St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre====
Three days later, Admiral Coligny was walking back to his rooms from the Louvre when a shot rang out from a house and wounded him in the hand and arm. A smoking arquebus was discovered in a window, but the culprit had made his escape from the rear of the building on a waiting horse. Coligny was carried to his lodgings at the Hôtel de Béthisy, where the surgeon Ambroise Paré removed a bullet from his elbow and amputated a damaged finger with a pair of scissors. Catherine, who was said to have received the news without emotion, made a tearful visit to Coligny and promised to punish his attacker. Many historians have blamed Catherine for the attack on Coligny. Others point to the Guise family or a Spanish-papal plot to end Coligny&#x27;s influence on the king. Whatever the truth, the bloodbath that followed was soon beyond the control of Catherine or any other leader.

The St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre, which began two days later, has stained Catherine&#x27;s reputation ever since. There is reason to believe she was party to the decision when on 23 August Charles IX is said to have ordered, &quot;Then kill them all! Kill them all!&quot; Historians have suggested that Catherine and her advisers expected a Huguenot uprising to avenge the attack on Coligny. They chose therefore to strike first and wipe out the Huguenot leaders while they were still in Paris after the wedding.

The slaughter in Paris lasted for almost a week. It spread to many parts of France, where it persisted into the autumn. In the words of historian Jules Michelet, &quot;St Bartholomew was not a day, but a season&quot;. On 29 September, when Navarre knelt before the altar as a Roman Catholic, having converted to avoid being killed, Catherine turned to the ambassadors and laughed. From this time dates the legend of the wicked Italian queen. Huguenot writers branded Catherine a scheming Italian, who had acted on Machiavelli&#x27;s principles to kill all enemies in one blow.

===Reign of Henry III===
Two years later, Catherine faced a new crisis with the death of Charles IX at the age of twenty-three. His dying words were &quot;oh, my mother ...&quot; The day before he died, he named Catherine regent, since his brother and heir, Henry the Duke of Anjou, was in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, where he had been elected king the year before. However, three months after his coronation at Wawel Cathedral, Henry abandoned that throne and returned to France in order to become King of France. Catherine wrote to Henry of Charles IX&#x27;s death: &quot;I am grief-stricken to have witnessed such a scene and the love which he showed me at the end ... My only consolation is to see you here soon, as your kingdom requires, and in good health, for if I were to lose you, I would have myself buried alive with you.&quot;

Henry was Catherine&#x27;s favourite son. Unlike his brothers, he came to the throne as a grown man. He was also healthier, though he suffered from weak lungs and constant fatigue. His interest in the tasks of government, however, proved fitful. He depended on Catherine and her team of secretaries until the last few weeks of her life. He often hid from state affairs, immersing himself in acts of piety, such as pilgrimages and flagellation.

Henry married Louise de Lorraine-Vaudémont in February 1575, two days after his coronation. His choice thwarted Catherine&#x27;s plans for a political marriage to a foreign princess. Rumours of Henry&#x27;s inability to produce children were by that time in wide circulation. The papal nuncio Salviati observed, &quot;it is only with difficulty that we can imagine there will be offspring ... physicians and those who know him well say that he has an extremely weak constitution and will not live long.&quot; As time passed and the likelihood of children from the marriage receded, Catherine&#x27;s youngest son, Francis, Duke of Alençon, known as &quot;Monsieur&quot;, played upon his role as heir to the throne, repeatedly exploiting the anarchy of the civil wars, which were by now as much about noble power struggles as religion. Catherine did all in her power to bring Francis back into the fold. On one occasion, in March 1578, she lectured him for six hours about his dangerously subversive behaviour.

In 1576, in a move that endangered Henry&#x27;s throne, Francis allied with the Protestant princes against the crown. On 6 May 1576, Catherine gave in to almost all Huguenot demands in the Edict of Beaulieu. The treaty became known as the &quot;Peace of Monsieur&quot; because it was thought that Francis had forced it on the crown. Francis died of consumption in June 1584, after a disastrous intervention in the Low Countries during which his army had been massacred. Catherine wrote, the next day: &quot;I am so wretched to live long enough to see so many people die before me, although I realize that God&#x27;s will must be obeyed, that He owns everything, and that He lends us only for as long as He likes the children whom He gives us.&quot; The death of her youngest son was a calamity for Catherine&#x27;s dynastic dreams. Under Salic law, by which only males could ascend the throne, the Huguenot Henry of Navarre now became heir presumptive to the French crown.

Catherine had at least taken the precaution of marrying Margaret, her youngest daughter, to Navarre. Margaret, however, became almost as much of a thorn in Catherine&#x27;s side as Francis, and in 1582, she returned to the French court without her husband. Catherine was heard yelling at her for taking lovers. Catherine sent Pomponne de Bellièvre to Navarre to arrange Margaret&#x27;s return. In 1585, Margaret fled Navarre again. She retreated to her property at Agen and begged her mother for money. Catherine sent her only enough &quot;to put food on her table&quot;. Moving on to the fortress of Carlat, Margaret took a lover called d&#x27;Aubiac. Catherine asked Henry to act before Margaret brought shame on them again. In October 1586, therefore, he had Margaret locked up in the Château d&#x27;Usson. D&#x27;Aubiac was executed, though not, despite Catherine&#x27;s wish, in front of Margaret. Catherine cut Margaret out of her will and never saw her again.

Catherine was unable to control Henry in the way she had Francis and Charles. Her role in his government became that of chief executive and roving diplomat. She travelled widely across the kingdom, enforcing his authority and trying to head off war. In 1578, she took on the task of pacifying the south. At the age of fifty-nine, she embarked on an eighteen-month journey around the south of France to meet Huguenot leaders face to face. Her efforts won Catherine new respect from the French people. On her return to Paris in 1579, she was greeted outside the city by the Parlement and crowds. The Venetian ambassador, Gerolamo Lipomanno, wrote: &quot;She is an indefatigable princess, born to tame and govern a people as unruly as the French: they now recognize her merits, her concern for unity and are sorry not to have appreciated her sooner.&quot; She was under no illusions, however. On 25 November 1579, she wrote to the king, &quot;You are on the eve of a general revolt. Anyone who tells you differently is a liar.&quot;

====Catholic League====
Many leading Roman Catholics were appalled by Catherine&#x27;s attempts to appease the Huguenots. After the Edict of Beaulieu, they had started forming local leagues to protect their religion. The death of the heir to the throne in 1584 prompted the Duke of Guise to assume the leadership of the Catholic League. He planned to block Henry of Navarre&#x27;s succession and place Henry&#x27;s Catholic uncle Cardinal Charles de Bourbon on the throne instead. In this cause, he recruited the great Catholic princes, nobles and prelates, signed the treaty of Joinville with Spain, and prepared to make war on the &quot;heretics&quot;. By 1585, HenryIII had no choice but to go to war against the League. As Catherine put it, &quot;peace is carried on a stick&quot; (&quot;bâton porte paix&quot;). &quot;Take care&quot;, she wrote to the king, &quot;especially about your person. There is so much treachery about that I die of fear.&quot;

Henry was unable to fight the Catholics and the Protestants at once, both of whom had stronger armies than his own. In the Treaty of Nemours, signed on 7 July 1585, he was forced to give in to all the League&#x27;s demands, even that he pay its troops. He went into hiding to fast and pray, surrounded by a bodyguard known as &quot;the Forty-five&quot;, and left Catherine to sort out the mess. The monarchy had lost control of the country, and was in no position to assist England in the face of the coming Spanish attack. The Spanish ambassador told PhilipII that the abscess was about to burst.

By 1587, the Catholic backlash against the Protestants had become a campaign across Europe. Elizabeth I of England&#x27;s execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, on 8 February 1587 outraged the Catholic world. Philip II of Spain prepared for an invasion of England. The League took control of much of northern France to secure French ports for his armada.

====Last months and death====
Henry hired Swiss troops to help him defend himself in Paris. The Parisians, however, claimed the right to defend the city themselves. On 12 May 1588, they set up barricades in the streets and refused to take orders from anyone except the Duke of Guise. When Catherine tried to go to Mass, she found her way barred, though she was allowed through the barricades. The chronicler L&#x27;Estoile reported that she cried all through her lunch that day. She wrote to Bellièvre, &quot;Never have I seen myself in such trouble or with so little light by which to escape.&quot; As usual, Catherine advised the king, who had fled the city in the nick of time, to compromise and live to fight another day. On 15 June 1588, Henry duly signed the Act of Union, which gave in to all the League&#x27;s latest demands.

On 8 September 1588 at Blois, where the court had assembled for a meeting of the Estates, Henry dismissed all his ministers without warning. Catherine, in bed with a lung infection, had been kept in the dark. The king&#x27;s actions effectively ended her days of power.

At the meeting of the Estates, Henry thanked Catherine for all she had done. He called her not only the mother of the king but the mother of the state. Henry did not tell Catherine of his plan for a solution to his problems. On 23 December 1588, he asked the Duke of Guise to call on him at the Château de Blois. As Guise entered the king&#x27;s chamber, the Forty-five plunged their blades into his body, and he died at the foot of the king&#x27;s bed. At the same moment, eight members of the Guise family were rounded up, including the Duke of Guise&#x27;s brother, Louis II, Cardinal of Guise, whom Henry&#x27;s men hacked to death the next day in the palace dungeons. Immediately after the murder of Guise, Henry entered Catherine&#x27;s bedroom on the floor below and announced, &quot;Please forgive me. Monsieur de Guise is dead. He will not be spoken of again. I have had him killed. I have done to him what he was going to do to me.&quot; Catherine&#x27;s immediate reaction is not known; but on Christmas Day, she told a friar, &quot;Oh, wretched man! What has he done? ... Pray for him ... I see him rushing towards his ruin.&quot; She visited her old friend Cardinal de Bourbon on 1 January 1589 to tell him she was sure he would soon be freed. He shouted at her, &quot;Your words, Madam, have led us all to this butchery.&quot; She left in tears.
On 5 January 1589, Catherine died at the age of sixty-nine, probably from pleurisy. L&#x27;Estoile wrote: &quot;those close to her believed that her life had been shortened by displeasure over her son&#x27;s deed.&quot; He added that she had no sooner died than she was treated with as much consideration as a dead goat. Because Paris was held by enemies of the crown, Catherine had to be buried provisionally at Blois. Eight months later, Jacques Clément stabbed HenryIII to death. At the time, Henry was besieging Paris with the King of Navarre, who would succeed him as Henry IV of France. HenryIII&#x27;s assassination ended nearly three centuries of Valois rule and brought the Bourbon dynasty into power. Years later, Diane, daughter of HenryII and Philippa Duci, had Catherine&#x27;s remains reinterred in the Saint-Denis basilica in Paris. In 1793, a revolutionary mob tossed her bones into a mass grave with those of the other kings and queens.

Henry IV was later reported to have said of Catherine:

==Patron of the arts==
Catherine believed in the humanist ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose authority depended on letters as well as arms. She was inspired by the example of her father-in-law, King Francis I of France, who had hosted the leading artists of Europe at his court, and by her Medici ancestors. In an age of civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display. Once in control of the royal purse, she launched a programme of artistic patronage that lasted for three decades. During this time, she presided over a distinctive late French Renaissance culture in all branches of the arts.

An inventory drawn up at the Hôtel de la Reine after Catherine&#x27;s death shows her to have been a keen collector. Listed works of art included tapestries, hand-drawn maps, sculptures, rich fabrics, ebony furniture inlaid with ivory, sets of china, and Limoges pottery. There were also hundreds of portraits, for which a vogue had developed during Catherine&#x27;s lifetime. Many portraits in her collection were by Jean Clouet (1480–1541) and his son François Clouet (–1572). François Clouet drew and painted portraits of all Catherine&#x27;s family and of many members of the court. After Catherine&#x27;s death, a decline in the quality of French portraiture set in. By 1610, the school patronised by the late Valois court and brought to its pinnacle by François Clouet had all but died out.

Beyond portraiture, little is known about the painting at Catherine de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s court. In the last two decades of her life, only two painters stand out as recognisable personalities: Jean Cousin the Younger (), few of whose works survive, and Antoine Caron (–1599), who became Catherine&#x27;s official painter after working at Fontainebleau under Primaticcio. Caron&#x27;s vivid Mannerism, with its love of ceremonial and its preoccupation with massacres, reflects the neurotic atmosphere of the French court during the Wars of Religion.

Many of Caron&#x27;s paintings, such as those of the &quot;Triumphs of the Seasons&quot;, are of allegorical subjects that echo the festivities for which Catherine&#x27;s court was famous. His designs for the Valois Tapestries celebrate the &quot;fêtes&quot;, picnics, and mock battles of the &quot;magnificent&quot; entertainments hosted by Catherine. They depict events held at Fontainebleau in 1564; at Bayonne in 1565 for the summit meeting with the Spanish court; and at the Tuileries in 1573 for the visit of the Polish ambassadors who presented the Polish crown to Catherine&#x27;s son Henry of Anjou.
The musical shows in particular allowed Catherine to express her creative gifts. They were usually dedicated to the ideal of peace in the realm and based on mythological themes. To create the necessary dramas, music, and scenic effects for these events, Catherine employed the leading artists and architects of the day. Historian Frances Yates has called her &quot;a great creative artist in festivals.&quot; Catherine gradually introduced changes to the traditional entertainments: for example, she increased the prominence of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments. A distinctive new art form, the &quot;ballet de cour&quot;, emerged from these creative advances. Owing to its synthesis of dance, music, verse, and setting, the production of the &quot;Ballet Comique de la Reine&quot; in 1581 is regarded by scholars as the first authentic ballet.

Catherine de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s great love among the arts was architecture. &quot;As the daughter of the Medici,&quot; suggests French art historian Jean-Pierre Babelon, &quot;she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died.&quot; After HenryII&#x27;s death, Catherine set out to immortalise her husband&#x27;s memory and to enhance the grandeur of the Valois monarchy through a series of costly building projects. These included work on the Château de Montceaux, Château de Saint-Maur, and Chenonceau. Catherine built two new palaces in Paris: the Tuileries and the Hôtel de la Reine. She was closely involved in the planning and supervising of all her architectural schemes.

Catherine had emblems of her love and grief carved into the stonework of her buildings. Poets lauded her as the new Artemisia, after Artemisia II of Caria, who built the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus as a tomb for her dead husband. As the centrepiece of an ambitious new chapel, she commissioned a magnificent tomb for Henry at the basilica of Saint Denis. It was designed by Francesco Primaticcio (1504–1570), with sculpture by Germain Pilon (1528–1590). Art historian Henri Zerner has called this monument &quot;the last and most brilliant of the royal tombs of the Renaissance.&quot; Catherine also commissioned Germain Pilon to carve the marble sculpture that contains HenryII&#x27;s heart. A poem by Ronsard, engraved on its base, tells the reader not to wonder that so small a vase can hold so large a heart, since Henry&#x27;s real heart resides in Catherine&#x27;s breast.

Although Catherine spent ruinous sums on the arts, most of her patronage left no permanent legacy. The end of the Valois dynasty so soon after her death brought a change in priorities.

=== Culinary legend ===

The legend that de&#x27; Medici introduced a long list of foods, techniques and utensils from Italy to France is discredited by food historians. Barbara Ketcham Wheaton and Stephen Mennell provided the definitive arguments against these claims. They point out that Catherine&#x27;s father-in-law, King FrancisI, and the flower of the French aristocracy had dined at some of Italy&#x27;s most élite tables during the king&#x27;s Italian campaigns (and that an earlier generation had done so during King Charles VIII&#x27;s invasion of 1494); that a vast Italian entourage had visited France for the wedding of Catherine de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s father to her French-born mother; and that she had little influence at court until her husband&#x27;s death because he was so besotted by his mistress, Diane de Poitiers. In fact, a large population of Italians—bankers, silk-weavers, philosophers, musicians, and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci—had emigrated to France to promote the burgeoning Renaissance. Nevertheless, popular culture frequently attributes Italian culinary influence and forks in France to Catherine.

The earliest known reference to Catherine as the popularizer of Italian culinary innovation is the entry for &quot;cuisine&quot; in Diderot and d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; published in 1754, which describes haute cuisine as decadent and effeminate and explains that fussy sauces and fancy fricassees arrived in France via &quot;that crowd of corrupt Italians who served at the court of Catherine de&#x27; Medici.&quot;

==Links to the occult==
Catherine de&#x27; Medici has been labelled by Wiccan Gerald Gardner a &quot;sinister Queen ... noted for her interest in the occult arts&quot;. Catherine and Henry&#x27;s inability to produce an heir for the first ten years of their marriage gave rise to suspicion of witchcraft. Labouvie suggested that women&#x27;s power was believed to be the ability to create and sustain life, whilst witches were believed to have the opposite power; that of attacking health, life and fertility. An infertile woman, and in particular an infertile queen, was therefore regarded as &#x27;unnatural&#x27; and a small step from supernatural. Essentially, however, there exists no concrete proof that she took part in the occult, and it is now believed that Catherine&#x27;s trouble in providing an heir was in fact due to Henry II&#x27;s penile deformity.

Catherine herself had been educated by Cosimo Ruggeri in astrology and astronomy, which were closely linked in her day and were an academic rather than a Satanic activity, although his general background and favourite status suggests there was more to it than that. It has been suggested that Catherine educated her son, Henry III, in the dark arts, and that &quot;the two devoted themselves to sorceries that were scandals of the age&quot;.. As a result, some (more extreme) authors believe Catherine to be the creator of the Black Mass, a Satanic inversion of the traditional Catholic Mass, although there is little to prove this aside from Jean Bodin&#x27;s account in his book &quot;De la démonomanie des sorciers&quot;. Nevertheless, Catherine was never formally accused or prosecuted despite the fact that her reign experienced the greatest number of prosecutions for witchcraft in Italy. This lends some weight to the suggestion that people were labelled &#x27;witches&#x27; simply because they did not act the way a woman would have been expected to act, or simply to suit personal or political agendas. This may be particularly true for Catherine as an Italian woman ruling in France; several historians argue that she was disliked by her French subjects, who labelled her &quot;the Italian woman&quot;. In any event, the rumours have made a mark on Catherine&#x27;s reputation over time, and there are now many dramaticised works about her involvement in the occult.

==Issue==
Catherine de&#x27; Medici married Henry, Duke of Orléans, the future Henry II of France, in Marseille on 28 October 1533. She gave birth to ten children, of whom four sons and three daughters survived to marriageable age. Three of her sons became kings of France, while two of her daughters married kings and one married a duke. Catherine outlived all her children except HenryIII, who died seven months after her, and Margaret, who inherited her robust health. Victoire and Jeanne were twin daughters born in 1556; Jeanne was stillborn due to surgeons breaking her legs to save her mother&#x27;s life; Victoire survived, dying less than two months later. According to the diplomat Simon Renard, the birth nearly killed Catherine, and the royal couple were advised by the King&#x27;s physician to have no further children.

<doc id="44158" wikidata="Q822938" url="?curid=44158" title="Conservative force">
<text>In physics, a conservative force is a force with the property that the total work done by the force in moving a particle between two points is independent of the path taken. Equivalently, if a particle travels in a closed loop, the total work done (the sum of the force acting along the path multiplied by the displacement) by a conservative force is zero.

A conservative force depends only on the position of the object. If a force is conservative, it is possible to assign a numerical value for the potential at any point and conversely, when an object moves from one location to another, the force changes the potential energy of the object by an amount that does not depend on the path taken, contributing to the mechanical energy and the overall conservation of energy. If the force is not conservative, then defining a scalar potential is not possible, because taking different paths would lead to conflicting potential differences between the start and end points.

Gravitational force is an example of a conservative force, while frictional force is an example of a non-conservative force.

Other examples of conservative forces are: force in elastic spring, electrostatic force between two electric charges, and magnetic force between two magnetic poles. The last two forces are called central forces as they act along the line joining the centres of two charged/magnetized bodies. A central force is conservative if and only if it is spherically symmetric.

For conservative forces,

formula_1

where formula_2 is the conservative force, formula_3 is the potential energy, and formula_4 is the position.

==Informal definition==
Informally, a conservative force can be thought of as a force that &quot;conserves&quot; mechanical energy. Suppose a particle starts at point A, and there is a force &quot;F&quot; acting on it. Then the particle is moved around by other forces, and eventually ends up at A again. Though the particle may still be moving, at that instant when it passes point A again, it has traveled a closed path. If the net work done by &quot;F&quot; at this point is 0, then &quot;F&quot; passes the closed path test. Any force that passes the closed path test for all possible closed paths is classified as a conservative force.

The gravitational force, spring force, magnetic force (according to some definitions, see below) and electric force (at least in a time-independent magnetic field, see Faraday&#x27;s law of induction for details) are examples of conservative forces, while friction and air drag are classical examples of non-conservative forces.

For non-conservative forces, the mechanical energy that is lost (not conserved) has to go somewhere else, by conservation of energy. Usually the energy is turned into heat, for example the heat generated by friction. In addition to heat, friction also often produces some sound energy. The water drag on a moving boat converts the boat&#x27;s mechanical energy into not only heat and sound energy, but also wave energy at the edges of its wake. These and other energy losses are irreversible because of the second law of thermodynamics.

==Path independence==

A direct consequence of the closed path test is that the work done by a conservative force on a particle moving between any two points does not depend on the path taken by the particle.

This is illustrated in the figure to the right: The work done by the gravitational force on an object depends only on its change in height because the gravitational force is conservative. The work done by a conservative force is equal to the negative of change in potential energy during that process. For a proof, imagine two paths 1 and 2, both going from point A to point B. The variation of energy for the particle, taking path 1 from A to B and then path 2 backwards from B to A, is 0; thus, the work is the same in path 1 and 2, i.e., the work is independent of the path followed, as long as it goes from A to B.

For example, if a child slides down a frictionless slide, the work done by the gravitational force on the child from the start of the slide to the end is independent of the shape of the slide; it only depends on the vertical displacement of the child.

==Mathematical description==
A force field &quot;F&quot;, defined everywhere in space (or within a simply-connected volume of space), is called a &quot;conservative force&quot; or &quot;conservative vector field&quot; if it meets any of these three &quot;equivalent&quot; conditions:

# The curl of &quot;F&quot; is the zero vector: formula_5 where in two dimensions this reduces to: formula_6
# There is zero net work (&quot;W&quot;) done by the force when moving a particle through a trajectory that starts and ends in the same place: formula_7
# The force can be written as the negative gradient of a potential, formula_8: formula_9

The term &quot;conservative force&quot; comes from the fact that when a conservative force exists, it conserves mechanical energy. The most familiar conservative forces are gravity, the electric force (in a time-independent magnetic field, see Faraday&#x27;s law), and spring force.

Many forces (particularly those that depend on velocity) are not force &quot;fields&quot;. In these cases, the above three conditions are not mathematically equivalent. For example, the magnetic force satisfies condition 2 (since the work done by a magnetic field on a charged particle is always zero), but does not satisfy condition 3, and condition 1 is not even defined (the force is not a vector field, so one cannot evaluate its curl). Accordingly, some authors classify the magnetic force as conservative, while others do not. The magnetic force is an unusual case; most velocity-dependent forces, such as friction, do not satisfy any of the three conditions, and therefore are unambiguously nonconservative.

==Non-conservative force==

Despite conservation of total energy, non-conservative forces can arise in classical physics due to neglected degrees of freedom or from time-dependent potentials. Many non-conservative forces may be perceived as macroscopic effects of small-scale conservative forces. For instance, friction may be treated without violating conservation of energy by considering the motion of individual molecules; however, that means every molecule&#x27;s motion must be considered rather than handling it through statistical methods. For macroscopic systems the non-conservative approximation is far easier to deal with than millions of degrees of freedom.

Examples of non-conservative forces are friction and non-elastic material stress. Friction has the effect of transferring some of the energy from the large-scale motion of the bodies to small-scale movements in their interior, and therefore appear non-conservative on a large scale. General relativity is non-conservative, as seen in the anomalous precession of Mercury&#x27;s orbit. However, general relativity does conserve a stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor.

<doc id="44160" wikidata="Q1437595" url="?curid=44160" title="Sauk people">
<text>The Sauk or Sac are Native Americans and Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands. Their historical territory was near Green Bay, Wisconsin. Today they have three tribes based in Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. Their federally recognized tribes are:
* Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska
* Sac and Fox Nation, Oklahoma
* Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa.

They are closely allied with the Meskwaki people. Their Sauk language is part of the Algonquian language family.

== Name ==
The Sauk or Sac called themselves Thâkîwaki, translating as &quot;people coming forth [from the outlet]&quot; or &quot;[from the water]&quot;. Their autonym is written oθaakiiwaki in the current orthography. Ojibwe people called them Ozaagii(-wag). The latter name was transliterated into French and English by European colonists.

The neighboring Anishanabeg Ojibwe (Sauk name: Ochipwêwa) and Odawa peoples referred to them by the exonym &quot;Ozaagii(-wag)&quot;, meaning &quot;those at the outlet&quot;. French colonists transliterated that as &quot;Sac&quot; and the English as &quot;Sauk&quot;. The Sauk/Sac called themselves the 
autonym of Othâkîwa, Thâkîwa, Thâkîwaki or &quot;Asaki-waki/Oθaakiiwaki&quot; people of the yellow earth [(&quot;people coming forth [from the outlet],&quot; i.e., &quot;from the water&quot;)], which is often interpreted to mean &quot;yellow-earth people&quot; or &quot;the Yellow-Earths&quot;, due to the yellow-clay soils found around Saginaw Bay. This interpretation possibly derived from the Sauk words &quot;Athâwethiwa&quot; or (&quot;yellow&quot;) and &quot;Neniwaki&quot; (&quot;men, people&quot;). This was later shortened to &quot;Asaki-waki&quot;. In addition, the Fox (Meskwaki) were generally known among neighboring tribes as the &quot;people of the red earth&quot; - the Sauk and Fox also used this term: &quot;Êshkwîha&quot; or &quot;Meshkwahkîha&quot; (&quot;people of the red earth&quot;).

==History==
=== Precontact to 17th century ===
The Sauk, an Algonquian languages people, are believed to have developed as a people along the St. Lawrence River, which is now northern New York. The precise time is unknown, but around the time of the year 1600, they were driven from the area of the St. Lawrence River. Some historians believe that the Sauk migrated to what is now eastern Michigan, where they settled around Saginaw Bay (Ojibwe: &quot;Zaagiinaad-wiikwed&quot; – &quot;Of the Outlet Bay&quot;). For many years, the Sauk are believed to have prospered in the fertile valley of Saginaw thereafter. They had been driven west by pressure from other tribes, especially the powerful Haudenosaunee, which sought control over hunting grounds in the area.

Some Ojibwe oral histories also place the Sauk in the Saginaw Valley some time before the arrival of Europeans. Sauk traditions state that the tribe occupied the vicinity of Saginaw river. (In this tradition, the name &#x27;Saginaw&#x27; comes from the Ojibwe &quot;O-Sauk-e-non,&quot; meaning &quot;land of the Sauks&quot; or &quot;where the Sauks were.&quot;) Approximately from the years 1638 to 1640, it is believed that a fierce battle ensued, nearly annihilating the entire Sauk Tribe. According to the legend, the Ojibwe inhabited the lands north of the Saginaw Bay, and the harsher northern climate caused more difficulty in prosperity compared to that of the Sauk occupying the area of Saginaw Valley. The Ojibwe allied with the Odawa, who resided south of the Sauk, and sprung a series of attacks on the Sauk, which practically decimated their people. One such attack, the Battle of Skull Island, occurred on a peninsula in the Saginaw River, which then was called Skull Island. (Its name came from the many skulls and bones supposedly found in mounds on that island over the years.) In this battle, it is said that the Sauk had used their boats to cross part of the river, escape to the island, and were temporarily free from their attackers. But when morning came, ice had solidified the river enough for the Ojibwe to cross. They killed every member of the Sauk tribe who had fled to that island besides 12 women whom they later sent west of the Mississippi River.

But later Europeans may have mistakenly recorded the Sauk as once dwelling at this location near Lake Huron. There is little archaeological evidence that the Sauk lived in the Saginaw area. In the early 17th century, when natives told French explorer Samuel de Champlain that the Sauk nation was located on the west shore of Lake Michigan, Champlain mistakenly placed them on the western shore of Lake Huron. This mistake was copied on subsequent maps, and future references identified this as the place of the Sauk. Champlain never visited what is now Michigan.

Anishinaabe expansion and the Huron attempting to gain regional stability drove the Sac out of their territory. The Huron were armed with guns supplied by their French trading partners. The Sac moved south to territory in parts of what are now northern Illinois and Wisconsin. In the 17th century the Sauk also maintained close relations with the Potawatomi (Pehkînenîha or Shîshîpêhinenîha). This relation has been found by borrowings of Sauk vocabulary that appear in the Potawatomi language.

In a loose coalition of tribes – including Dakota (Ashâha), Ho-Chunk, Ojibwe, Odawa, Potawatomi, Kickapoo (Kîkâpôwa), Meskwaki (Fox), and Sauk, along with the Shawnee (Shâwanôwa), Cherokee (Shanahkîha), and Choctaw (Châkitâha) from the Southeast – they attacked the tribes of the Illinois Confederation (Mashkotêwa) and tried to invade their tribal areas. The Illinois (Inoca) became their worst common enemies. The coalition warred for years until they destroyed the Illinois Confederation.

Later they moved out on the prairie (Mashkotêwi) along the Mississippi and adopted the semi-sedentary lifestyle of Plains Indians (Mashkotêwineniwa). In addition to hunting buffalo, they lived in villages, raised crops, and actively traded with other tribes. The Sauk and allied eastern tribes had to compete with tribes who already occupied this territory. Disputes and clashes arose with the Dakota, Pawnee (Pânîha) and, most of all, the powerful Osage (Washâsha).

=== 18th century ===
The Sauk had good relations with the English (Thâkanâsha) through trading. At first, the Sauk had good relations with New France too, until their alliance with the Meskwaki (Fox) made them short-term enemies of the French (Mêmehtekôshîha, Wêmehtekôshîha).

A closely allied tribe, the Meskwaki (Fox), were noted for resisting French encroachment, having fought two wars against them in the early 18th century. After a devastating battle of September 9, 1730, in Illinois, in which hundreds of warriors were killed and many women and children taken captive by French allies, Fox refugees took shelter with the Sac. This made the Sauk subject to French attack in turn. The Sauk continued moving west to Iowa and Kansas. Keokuk and Black Hawk were two important leaders who arose among the Sauk. At first, Keokuk accepted the loss of land as inevitable in the face of the vast numbers of white soldiers and settlers coming west. He tried to preserve tribal land and his people, and to keep the peace.

=== 19th century ===

Having failed to receive expected supplies from the Americans on credit, Black Hawk wanted to fight, saying his people were &quot;forced into war by being deceived&quot;. Led by Black Hawk in 1832, the mainly Sac band resisted the continued loss of lands (in western Illinois, this time.) Their warfare with United States forces resulted in defeat at the hands of General Edmund P. Gaines in the Black Hawk War.

From 1832 to 1837, debt and poverty were tools used to coerce the Sauk and Meskwaki to relocate three times following successive cessions of territory. The population of the two tribes living in Iowa was halved in the twelve years from 1833 to 1845.

=== Oklahoma history ===
About this time, one group of Sac moved into Missouri, and later to Kansas and Nebraska. In 1869, after the Civil War, the United States forced the larger group of Sac to move into a reservation in Indian Territory (now the state of Oklahoma). They formed the federally recognized Sac and Fox Nation, which is misnamed and is primarily Sauk. The United States had been making treaties with the two tribes together since their residency in the Midwest. A number of Meskwaki returned to the Midwest from Oklahoma (or resisted leaving.) They joined the Meskwaki at the Meskwaki Settlement in Tama County, Iowa.

The land currently occupied by the Sauk is only a section of what used to be the Sac and Fox Reservation from 1867 to 1891. This reservation was established by the U.S. and spanned 480,000 acres. In 1887, however, the Dawes Act purposely broke collective tribal lands into small allotments designated for individual households. The remainder of land not allotted to the Sac and Fox was then sold to non-Native settlers in an attempt to gain Oklahoma statehood and the full assimilation of its Native American population.

By 1889, 519 of the tribe were located in Indian Territory, what is now central Oklahoma. On June 10, 1890, they ceded these Indian Territory lands to the federal government.

=== Treaties with U.S. ===
Many of the latter treaties listed have little to no information regarding their details, besides the date. The Sauk signed a total of 22 treaties from 1789 to 1891.

* Treaty of Fort Harmar
* Treaty of Greenville
* Treaty of St. Louis (1804)

* 1854 Treaty (Missouri Sac and Fox)

* 1861 Treaty (Iowa Sac and Fox)
* Feb 18th, 1867
* June 10, 1872 &quot;Act of Congress&quot; (Missouri Sac and Fox)
* Feb 13th, 1891 &quot;Act of Congress&quot;

==Clan system==
The Sauk and Fox peoples were divided into two moieties or &quot;divisions&quot;, which in turn were subdivided into Patri-lineages and Clans as local subgroups (segments).

The moieties were known as the Kishko/Ki-sko-ha/Kîshkôha (male: &quot;Kîshkôha&quot;, female: &quot;Kîshkôhkwêha&quot;) (&quot;the long-haired&quot;) and as the Oskush/Askasa/Shkasha (male: &quot;Shkasha/Oshkashîwiwa&quot;, female: &quot;Shkashîhkwêwa/Oshkashîhkwêwiwa&quot;) (&quot;the brave&quot;). The two moieties were each symbolized by two colors: The &quot;Askasa/Shkasha&quot; painted their faces and partly their bodies with charcoal in &quot;mahkatêwâwi&quot; (black) and the &quot;Ki-sko-ha/Kîshkôha&quot; painted their bodies with white clay in &quot;wâpeshkyâwi&quot; (white). This duality was also celebrated by the two moieties in Lacrosse, which was often played extremely brutally to toughen young warriors for combat, for recreation, as part of festivals, and used as preparation for imminent wars or raids.

This division has survived to the present day, but is now more related to the political system of the United States: the supporters of the Democratic Party are associated with the &quot;Kîshkôha/Kîshkôhkwêha&quot;, while the supporters of the Republican Party are associated with the &quot;Shkasha/Shkashîhkwêwa&quot;.

Originally, the Sauk had a patrilineal and exogamous clan system, in which descent and inheritance was traced through the father. Clans or &quot;Mîthonî&quot; distinguished and named on the basis of totem animals, which are: &quot;Mahkwithowa&quot; (Bear Clan), &quot;Amehkwithowa&quot; (Beaver Clan), &quot;Peshekethiwithowa&quot; (Deer Clan), &quot;Ketiwithowa / Mekethiwithowa&quot; (Eagle Clan), &quot;Nemêthithowa&quot; (Fish Clan), &quot;Wâkoshêhithowa&quot; (Fox Clan), &quot;Kehchikamîwithowa&quot; (Ocean/Sea/Great Lake Clan), &quot;Keshêhokimâwithowa&quot; (Peace Clan), &quot;Ahpenîthowa&quot; (Potato Clan), &quot;Akônithowa&quot; (Snow Clan), &quot;Nenemehkiwithowa&quot; (Thunder Clan), &quot;Manethenôkimâwithowa&quot; (Warrior Clan), and &quot;Mahwêwithowa&quot; (Wolf Clan).

Saukenuk or Saukietown (today: Black Hawk State Historic Site) near the mouth of the Rock River (&quot;Sinnissippi&quot; – &quot;rocky waters&quot;) into the Mississippi (&quot;Mäse&#x27;sibowi&quot; – &quot;great river&quot;), the most important Sauk settlement in the 18th and 19th centuries with about 4,000 inhabitants, was divided into 12 districts, which were assigned to the respective clans.

The tribe was governed by a council of sacred clan chiefs, a war chief, the head of families, and the warriors. Chiefs were recognized in three categories: civil, war, and ceremonial. Only the civil chiefs were hereditary. The other two chiefs were recognized by bands after they demonstrated their ability or spiritual power.

This traditional manner of selecting historic clan chiefs and governance was replaced in the 19th century by the United States appointing leaders through their agents at the Sac and Fox Agency, or reservation in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). In the 20th century, the tribe adopted a constitutional government patterned after the United States form. They elect their chiefs.

==Federally recognized tribes==
Today, the federally recognized Sac and Fox tribes include:
*Sac and Fox Nation (, &quot;meaning: &quot;People of the yellow earth&quot;&quot;), headquartered in Stroud, Oklahoma;
*Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa (, &quot;meaning: &quot;People of the red earth&quot;&quot;), headquartered in Tama, Iowa; and
*Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska (), headquartered in Reserve, Kansas.

==Language==
==Geographical names==
Lake Osakis in west-central Minnesota, the Sauk River, which flows from Lake Osakis, and the towns of Osakis, Sauk Centre, and Sauk Rapids all were named for association historically with a small party of Sac who made camp on the shores of Lake Osakis. They had been banished from their tribe for murder. According to Anishinaabe oral tradition, these five Sac were killed by local Dakota in the late 18th century.

Place names with &quot;Sauk&quot; references include: 
*Iowa: Sac City, Sac County, and Sac Township.
*Illinois: Sauk Village; Sauk Valley: the cities of Dixon, Sterling, Rock Falls and the surrounding area; Sauk Trail, a winding road south of Chicago, said to follow an old Indian trail; Johnson-Sauk Trail State Recreation Area; and Black Hawk College [Moline and Kewanee, IL].
*Michigan: The name of Saginaw is believed to mean &quot;where the Sauk were&quot; in Ojibwe; and the Saginaw Trail is said to follow an ancient Native American trail. US Route 12 in Michigan is said to follow the Sauk Native American trail.
*Minnesota: City of Sauk Centre, Le Sauk and Little Sauk townships, Lake Osakis, Sauk River, Sauk Rapids.
*Missouri: Sac Township, Sac River and Little Sac River of southwest Missouri
*North Dakota: Sauk Prairie and Sauk Valley Township
*Wisconsin: Prairie du Sac, Sauk City, Saukville, Sauk County and Ozaukee County

==Notes==
:1. The name of the Sauk River in Washington State, however, comes from the &quot;Sah-kee-ma-hu&quot; (Sauk-Suiattle tribe), a group related to the Skagit tribes, not from the Sac tribe of the Midwestern U.S.

<doc id="44165" wikidata="Q17245" url="?curid=44165" title="Cluedo">
<text>Cluedo (), known as Clue in North America, is a murder mystery game for three to six players (depending on editions) that was devised in 1943 by British board game designer Anthony E. Pratt. The game was first manufactured by Waddingtons in the United Kingdom in 1949. Since then, it has been relaunched and updated several times, and it is currently owned and published by the American game and toy company Hasbro.

The object of the game is to determine who murdered the game&#x27;s victim, where the crime took place, and which weapon was used. Each player assumes the role of one of the six suspects and attempts to deduce the correct answer by strategically moving around a game board representing the rooms of a mansion and collecting clues about the circumstances of the murder from the other players.

Numerous games, books, a film, television series, and theatre adaptations have been released as part of the &quot;Cluedo&quot; franchise. Several spinoffs have been released, featuring various extra characters, weapons, rooms, or a different gameplay. The original game is marketed as the &quot;Classic Detective Game&quot;, and the various spinoffs are all distinguished by different slogans.

In 2008, &quot;&quot; was created (with changes to the board, gameplay, and characters) as a modern spin-off, but was criticised in the media and by fans of the original game. &quot;Cluedo: The Classic Mystery Game&quot; was then introduced in 2012, returning to Pratt&#x27;s classic formula but also adding several variations.

==History==
Holed up in his home in Birmingham, England, during air raids on the city during World War II, Anthony E. Pratt, an English musician and factory worker, recalled the murder mystery games played by some of his clients at private music gigs as well as the detective fiction popular at the time, most notably Agatha Christie. In 1944, Pratt applied for a patent of his invention of a murder/mystery-themed game, originally named &quot;Murder!&quot; Shortly thereafter, Pratt and his wife, Elva Pratt (1913–1990), who had helped design the game, presented it to Waddingtons&#x27; executive Norman Watson, who immediately purchased it and provided its trademark name of &quot;Cluedo&quot; (a play on &quot;clue&quot; and &quot;Ludo&quot;, the Latin word for &quot;I play&quot; and the name of a popular board game based on Pachisi). The design of the house in the game is reputed to be based on what was the Tudor Close Hotel in Rottingdean, Brighton and Hove, with early editions of the game being titled &quot;Murder at Tudor Close&quot;.

Although the patent was granted in 1947, postwar shortages postponed the game&#x27;s official United Kingdom launch until 1949. It was simultaneously licensed to Parker Brothers in the United States for publication, where it was renamed &quot;Clue&quot;, as the name &quot;Ludo&quot; was not widely known there, Pachisi-style games having been published under other names and brands, so the play on words would not have been generally understood.

There were several differences between the original game concept and the one initially published in 1949. In particular, Pratt&#x27;s original design calls for 10 characters, one of whom was to be designated the victim by random drawing prior to the start of the game. These 10 included the eliminated Mr. Brown, Mr. Gold, Miss Grey, and Mrs. Silver. The characters of Nurse White and Colonel Yellow were renamed Mrs. White and Colonel Mustard for the actual release. The game allowed for play of up to eight remaining characters, providing for nine suspects in total. Originally there were 11 rooms, including the eliminated gun room and cellar. In addition, there were nine weapons, including the unused bomb, syringe, shillelagh (walking stick/cudgel), fireplace poker, and the later used axe and poison. Some of these unused weapons and characters appeared later in spin-off versions of the game.

Some gameplay aspects were different as well. Notably, the remaining playing cards were distributed into the rooms to be retrieved, rather than dealt directly to the players. Players also had to land on another player in order to make suggestions about that player&#x27;s character through the use of special tokens, and once exhausted, a player could no longer make suggestions. There were other minor differences, all of which were later updated by the game&#x27;s initial release and remain essentially unchanged in the standard Classic Detective Game editions of the game.

The methodology used in the early versions of &quot;Cluedo&quot; is remarkably similar to a traditional, if little known, American card game &quot;the king of hearts has five sons&quot;. However, Pratt himself said his inspiration was a murder mystery parlour game he used to play with friends in which youngsters &quot;would congregate in each other&#x27;s homes for parties at weekends. We&#x27;d play a stupid game called Murder, where guests crept up on each other in corridors and the victim would shriek and fall on the floor&quot;. The country house mystery was a popular subgenre of &quot;cosy&quot; English detective fiction in the 1920s and 1930s; stories were set in a residence of the gentry isolated by circumstances such as a snowstorm with the suspects gathered for a weekend house party.

===Marketing===
&quot;Cluedo&quot; was originally marketed as &quot;The Great New Detective Game&quot; upon its launch in 1949 in North America. A deal was quickly struck to license &quot;The Great New Sherlock Holmes Game&quot; from the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle estate. Advertising at the time suggested players would take on the guise of &quot;Sherlock Holmes following the path of the criminal&quot;, but no depictions of Holmes appear in the advertising or on the box. From 1950 until the 1960s, the game was marketed as &quot;The Great Detective Game&quot;, at which time it became the &quot;Parker Brothers Detective Game&quot;. 
With the launch of the US 1972 edition, a television commercial showed Holmes and Watson engaged in a particularly competitive game. Adjusting with the times, in 1979 US television commercials a detective, resembling a bumbling Inspector Clouseau from the popular &quot;Pink Panther&quot; film franchise, looks for clues. In 1986, the marketing slogan added &quot;Classic Detective Game&quot; which persists through the last 2002/2003 edition.

In the UK, &quot;Cluedo&quot; was marketed as &quot;The Great Detective Game&quot; from the mid-1950s until 2000, when it was rebranded as the &quot;Classic Detective Game&quot;. However, in the mid-1950s Waddingtons also adopted a Sherlock Holmes-type detective to adorn their box covers for a brief time, though unlike in the US editions, there was no acknowledgement that the character was actually the famous detective. In the 1980s, as in the US, Sherlock Holmes also appeared in TV advertising of the time, along with other classic detectives such as Sam Spade.

==Game==
===Equipment===
The game consists of a board which shows the rooms, corridors, and secret passages of an English country house called &quot;Tudor Mansion&quot; (named &quot;Tudor Close&quot;, &quot;Tudor Hall&quot;, &quot;Arlington Grange&quot;, &quot;Boddy Manor&quot; or &quot;Boddy Mansion&quot; in some editions) in Hampshire, England, in 1926. The game box also includes several coloured playing pieces to represent characters, miniature murder weapon props, two six-sided dice, three sets of cards (describing the aforementioned rooms, characters, or weapons), &quot;Solution Cards&quot; and an envelope (or a mirror in some editions) to contain one card from each set of cards and a &quot;Detective&#x27;s Notes&quot; pad on which are printed lists of rooms, weapons, and characters, so players can keep detailed notes during the game.

===Characters===
The murder victim in the game was known as Dr. Black in the UK edition and Mr. Boddy in North American versions. Updated editions of the game, released by Hasbro in 2023, refer to him as Boden &quot;Boddy&quot; Black Jr.

Player tokens are typically plastic pawns or figurines; the standard edition of the game has six suspects:

* Miss Scarlett (the second &quot;t&quot; was dropped in North American versions after 1963 and added back in 2016), the stock femme fatale character; she is represented by a red token/figurine.

* Colonel Mustard, a retired military officer with a distinguished career; he is represented by a yellow token/figurine.

* Mrs. White, the chief domestic servant, typically the housekeeper or cook, updated as &quot;Chef White&quot; in the 2023 edition; she is represented by a white token/figurine.
**In the 2016 edition Mrs. White was replaced by Dr. Orchid, a young biologist and adopted daughter of the victim, represented by a pink token. Dr. Orchid was replaced by Chef White in the 2023 UK and North American editions.

* Reverend Green, the local clergyman, updated as Mayor Green in the 2023 edition; he is represented by a green token/figurine.
** Known as Mr. Green in North American editions, initially a middle-aged businessman with possible criminal connections turned into a young and handsome playboy. 

* Mrs. Peacock, a stylish widowed socialite, updated as &quot;Solicitor Peacock&quot; in the 2023 edition; she is represented by a blue token/figurine.

* Professor Plum, an intelligent yet absent-minded academic; he is represented by a purple token/figurine.

===Weapons===
The weapon icons are typically made of unfinished pewter (except the rope, which may be plastic or string); special editions have included gold-plated, brass-finished, and sterling silver versions. Early versions of the game included lead piping that was made from actual lead, and which was replaced with a steel version in later editions.

* Candlestick
* Dagger (Knife in North American editions)
* Lead piping (Lead pipe in North American editions) 
* Revolver (first depicted in the UK as a Dreyse M1907 semi-automatic pistol, and in North America as a Colt M1911 pistol)
* Rope
* Spanner (Wrench in North American editions)

===Rooms===

There are nine rooms in the mansion where the murder can take place, laid out around the edge of the square game board. They consist of the hall, the lounge, the dining room, the kitchen, the ballroom, the conservatory, the billiard room, the library, and the study. Each of the four corner rooms contains a secret passage that leads to the room on the opposite diagonal corner of the map. The centre room (often referred to as the cellar or the stairs) is inaccessible to the players, but contains the solution envelope and is not otherwise used during gameplay. Each suspect token has a designated start space marked at the edge of the board. The corridor areas are marked out as square spaces through which the tokens move horizontally or vertically.

===Rules===
At the beginning of the play, three cards—one suspect, one room, and one weapon—are chosen at random and put into a special envelope, so that no one can see them. These cards represent the solution. The remainder of the cards are distributed among the players.

Players are instructed to assume the token/suspect nearest them. In older versions, the play begins with Miss Scarlett and proceeds clockwise. In modern versions, all players roll the die/dice and the highest total starts the game, with play again proceeding clockwise. Players roll the die/dice and move along the board&#x27;s corridor spaces, or into the rooms accordingly.

The objective of the game is to deduce the details of the murder, i.e. the cards in the envelope. There are six characters, six murder weapons, and nine rooms, leaving the players with 324 possibilities. As soon as a player enters a room, they may make a suggestion as to the details, naming a suspect, the room they are in, and the weapon. For example: &quot;I suspect Professor Plum, in the Dining Room, with the candlestick&quot;. The player&#x27;s suggestions must include the room they are currently in and may not be made in the corridors. The tokens for the suggested suspect and weapon are immediately moved into that room if they are not both already present. Players may include themselves and weapons/rooms for which they hold cards in their suggestions.

Once a player makes a suggestion, the others are called upon to disprove it. If the player to their left holds any of the three named cards, that player must privately show one (and only one) of the cards to the current player. Otherwise, the process continues clockwise around the table until either one player disproves the accusation, or no one can do so. A player&#x27;s turn normally ends once their suggestion is completed.

A player who believes they have determined the correct elements may make an accusation on their turn. The accusation can include any room, not necessarily the one occupied by the player (if any), and may be made immediately following a suggestion. The accusing player privately checks the three cards in the envelope. If they match the accusation, the player shows them to everyone and wins; if not, the player returns them to the envelope and may not move nor make suggestions/accusations for the remainder of the game. However, the other players can move their tokens into rooms when making suggestions and they must continue to privately show cards to disprove the suggestions. A player who makes a false accusation while blocking the door to a room must move into that room so others can enter and leave. If all players except one make false accusations, the remaining player wins by default.

If a player&#x27;s suggestion has brought another player&#x27;s token into a room, the second player may make their own suggestion in the room when their turn comes up, if desired. If not, they may move out of the room, and if able to reach another room, make a suggestion therein, as usual. In the American version, players are not allowed to make suggestions repeatedly by remaining in one room; if they wish to make a second suggestion, they must first spend a turn out of the room.

===Strategy===
====Choice of playing piece====
The first opportunity is to choose the initial playing piece.

Mrs. Peacock has an immediate advantage of starting one space closer to the first room than any of the other players. Professor Plum can move to the study, and then take the secret passage to the Kitchen, the hardest room to reach.

Traditionally, Miss Scarlett had the advantage of moving first. This has been eliminated with the implementation of the high-roll rule in modern versions.

====Navigating the board====
The next opportunity is the choice of initial rooms to enter. Again Mrs. Peacock has an advantage in that she is closest to the Conservatory, a corner room with a secret passage, enabling a player on their turn to move immediately to another room and make a suggestion after rolling the dice. Miss Scarlett has a similar advantage to the Lounge. Making as many suggestions as possible maximises how much information a player can gain, which is advantageous. Therefore, moving into a new room as frequently as possible is one way to meet this goal. Players should make good use of the secret passages. Following the shortest path between rooms then is a good choice, even if a player already holds the card representing that room in their hand. As mentioned earlier, blocking the passage of another player prevents them from attaining rooms from which to make suggestions.

====Making suggestions====
Each player begins the game with three to six cards in their hand, depending on the number of players. Keeping track of which cards are shown to each player is important in deducing the solution. Detective Notes are supplied with the game to help make this task easier. The pads can keep not only a history of which cards are in a player&#x27;s hand but also which cards have been shown by another player. It can also be useful in deducing which cards the other players have shown one another. For example, if Miss Scarlett disproves Rev. Green&#x27;s accusation that Mrs. Peacock did the crime in the Ballroom with the Candlestick, a player with both the Ballroom and Mrs. Peacock cards in their hand can then deduce that Miss Scarlett has the Candlestick.

A player makes a suggestion to learn which cards may be eliminated from suspicion, but in some cases, it may be advantageous for a player to include one of their own cards in a suggestion. This technique can be used for both forcing a player to reveal a different card as well as misleading other players into believing a specific card is suspect. Therefore, moving into a room already held in the player&#x27;s hand may work to their advantage. Suggestions may also be used to thwart a player&#x27;s opponent. Since every suggestion results in a suspect token being re-located to the suggested room, a suggestion may be used to prevent another player from achieving their intended destination, preventing them from suggesting a particular room, especially if that player appears to be getting close to a solution.

==Editions==
Parker Brothers and Waddingtons each produced their own unique editions between 1949 and 1992. Hasbro purchased both companies in the early 1990s and continued to produce unique editions for each market until 2002/2003 when the current edition of Cluedo/Clue was first released. At this time, Hasbro produced a unified product across markets. The game was then localised with regional differences in spelling and naming conventions.

During Cluedo&#x27;s long history, eight unique Clue editions were published in North America (1949, 1956/1960, 1960/1963, 1972, 1986, 1992, 1996, and 2002), including miniaturised &quot;travel&quot; editions. However, only three distinct editions of Cluedo were released in the UK – the longest of which lasted 47 years from its introduction in 1949 until its first successor in 1996. The eighth North American and fourth UK editions constitute the current shared game design. International versions occasionally developed their own unique designs for specific editions, although most drew on the designs and art from either the US or UK editions, and in some cases mixing elements from both, while localising others – specifically suspect portraits.

In July 2008, Hasbro released a revamped look for Clue in a reinvention called &quot;Clue: Discover the Secrets&quot;. This new version of the game offered major changes to the gameplay and to the characters and their backstories.

In July 2016, Hasbro replaced Mrs. White with a new character, Dr. Orchid, represented by an orchid pink piece. In this current standard edition, Mrs. Peacock has a new game-opening opportunity as her starting square is one step closer to the billiard room (with 9steps instead of 10). The squared-off door to the Conservatory makes the room harder for Rev. Green to reach as an opening move and increases the distance between the Ballroom and the Conservatory (from 4steps to 5).

In January 2023, Hasbro released a new edition of the game that included new miniatures and updated art and character backstories.

While the suspects&#x27; appearance and interior design of Dr. Black&#x27;s/Mr. Boddy&#x27;s mansion changed with each edition, the weapons underwent relatively minor changes, with the only major redesign occurring in the fourth 1972 US edition, which was adopted by the second 1996 UK edition and remains the standard configuration across all Classic Detective Game versions since. The artwork for the previous US editions tended to reflect the current popular style at the time they were released. The earlier UK editions were more artistically stylised themes. From 1972 on, the US editions presented lush box cover art depicting the six suspects in various candid poses within a room of the mansion. The UK would finally adopt this style only in its third release in 2000, prior to which Cluedo boxes depicted basic representations of the contents. Such lavish box art illustrations have become a hallmark of the game since copied for the numerous licensed variants which pay homage to Clue.

===&quot;Cluedo: Discover the Secrets&quot;===

In August 2008, Hasbro redesigned and updated the board, characters, weapons, and rooms. Changes to the rules of gameplay were made, some to accommodate the new features.

The suspects have new names and backgrounds, as well as differing abilities that may be used during the game. The revolver is now a pistol, the lead pipe and spanner/wrench have been removed, and a baseball bat, axe, dumbbell, trophy, and poison have been added. The nine rooms have changed to (in clockwise order): Hall, Guest House, Dining Room, Kitchen, Patio, Spa, Theatre, Living Room, and Observatory.

There is also a second deck of cards—the Intrigue cards. In this deck, there are two types of cards, Keepers and Clocks. Keepers are special abilities; for example, &quot;You can see the card&quot;. There are eight clocks—the first seven drawn do nothing—whoever draws the eighth is killed by the murderer and is out of the game.

The player must move to the indoor swimming pool in the centre of the board to make an accusation. This adds some challenge versus the ability to make accusations from anywhere in the original game.

The most significant change to gameplay is that once the suspect cards have been taken, the remaining cards are dealt so that all players have an even number of cards (rather than dealt out so that &quot;one player may have a slight advantage&quot;). This means that depending on the number of players a number of cards are left over. These cards are placed face down in the middle and are not seen unless a player takes a turn in the pool room to look at them.

The changes to the game have been criticised in the media, and by fans of the game, for unnecessarily altering classic cultural icons.

, Hasbro no longer sells the game via its website, but they do continue to sell a version of it as part of their &quot;Grab &amp; Go&quot; travel series. Notably, it plays identically to standard classic rules but visually continues to use the new Discover the Secrets room layout, and two of the new weapons, as well as other design artwork. However, the Intrigue cards are no longer a part of the game.

===&quot;Clue/Cluedo: The Classic Mystery Game&quot;===

&quot;Clue/Cluedo&quot; is a digital adaptation based on the official Hasbro board game developed by Marmalade Game Studio for iOS and Android mobile devices as well as Steam and Nintendo Switch. The object of the game is to determine who killed the game&#x27;s victim Dr. Black (or Mr. Boddy). The player, as one of the six suspects, will ask questions and take notes. The overall goal is to solve the crime first.

===Notable editions===
* &quot;Clue &quot;Master Detective&quot;&quot; (1988), an expanded version of the game featuring 12 rooms, 10 characters, and eight weapons with support for up to 10 players. In addition to the regular cast, &quot;Clue Master Detective&quot; adds Miss Peach, Monsieur Brunette, Madame Rose, and Sergeant Gray to the list of suspects. It also added poison and a horseshoe to the assortment of weapons. The fountain, the gazebo, the courtyard, and the carriage house were added to the list of rooms. This game is currently published in the USA by Winning Moves Games USA.
* &quot;Cluedo: 50th Anniversary&quot; (1999), also released as &quot;Clue: 50th Anniversary&quot; in the United States in 1998, this standard edition came in a &quot;deluxe&quot; format with the option to play with an extra murder weapon, a bottle of poison. This edition was also issued in a miniaturised Cluedo European travel version. Drew Struzan provided artwork for the game, which was originally created for the US 1996 edition and additionally used for &quot;The Limited Gift Edition&quot; and the US &quot;Clue Card Game&quot;, but he did not create the Rev. Green portrait used in the &quot;Cluedo&quot; editions.
* &quot;Clue &quot;Nostalgia Edition&quot;&quot; (2003, 2007) is a retro Nostalgia edition of the game, essentially a re-issue of the 1963 design in a wooden box. A custom version of the game was also released in the US by Restoration Hardware as &quot;Wooden Box Clue&quot; with different cover art. In the UK it was released under the Cluedo brand, and was an official re-issue of the original 1949 Waddingtons&#x27; design.
* &quot;Clue &quot;Vintage Edition&quot;&quot; (2005, 2009), also released as&quot; Cluedo &quot;Vintage Edition&quot;&quot;, is a re-formatted nostalgia edition into a &quot;vintage&quot; bookshelf collection along with a series of other popular board games. In the Cluedo version, they continued to use the 1963 design and adapted it for the UK market for the first time with localised characters and naming conventions.

==Franchise==

The board game franchise spans a 1985 feature film, a 1997 musical, a 2011 mini-series, numerous books, and several video games. First staged in 2017, a began a U.S. national tour in 2024.

==Worldwide differences==
Besides some rule differences listed above, some versions label the characters, weapons, rooms and in some instances the game itself differently.

In Canada and the U.S., the game is known as &quot;Clue&quot;. It was retitled because the traditional British board game &quot;Ludo&quot;, on which the name is based, was less well known there than its American variant &quot;Parcheesi&quot;.

The North American versions of &quot;Clue&quot; also replace the character &quot;Reverend Green&quot; from the original &quot;Cluedo&quot; with &quot;Mr. Green&quot;. This is the only region to continue to make such a change. Minor changes include &quot;Miss Scarlett&quot; with her name spelled with one &#x27;t&#x27;, the spanner being called a wrench, and the dagger being renamed a knife. In the 2016 U.S. edition, the knife was changed to a dagger. Until 2003, the lead piping was known as the lead pipe only in the North American edition.

In some international versions of the game (mostly the Spanish-language ones), the colours of some pieces are different, so as to correspond with the changes to each suspect&#x27;s unique foreign name variations. In some cases, rooms and weapons are changed in addition to other regional variances.

In South America, it is licensed and sold under several names. In Brazil, it is marketed under the Portuguese name .

==Recognition==
&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Clue&quot; in their Top 100 Games of 1980, praising it as &quot;still &quot;the&quot; classic detective game&quot;, Top 100 Games of 1981 (&quot;[the] characters in this 32-year-old game have become household words&quot;), and Top 100 Games of 1982 (&quot;Millions love this classic mystery game&quot;).

<doc id="44175" wikidata="Q170022" url="?curid=44175" title="House of Medici">
<text>The House of Medici ( , ; ) was an Italian banking family and political dynasty that first consolidated power in the Republic of Florence under Cosimo de&#x27; Medici and his grandson Lorenzo &quot;the Magnificent&quot; during the first half of the 15th century. The family originated in the Mugello region of Tuscany, and prospered gradually in trade until it was able to fund the Medici Bank. This bank was the largest in Europe in the 1400s and facilitated the Medicis&#x27; rise to political power in Florence, although they officially remained citizens rather than monarchs until the 16th century.

In 1532, the family acquired the hereditary title Duke of Florence. In 1569, the duchy was elevated to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany after territorial expansion. The Medici ruled the Grand Duchy from its inception under the builder Cosimo I until 1737, with the death of Gian Gastone de&#x27; Medici. The Medici produced four popes of the Catholic Church—Pope Leo X (1513–1521), Pope Clement VII (1523–1534), Pope Pius IV (1559–1565) and Pope Leo XI (1605)—and two queens of France—Catherine de&#x27; Medici (1547–1559) and Marie de&#x27; Medici (1600–1610). The Medici&#x27;s grand duchy witnessed degrees of economic growth under the early grand dukes, but was bankrupt by the time of Cosimo III de&#x27; Medici (r. 1670–1723).

The Medicis&#x27; wealth and influence was initially derived from the textile trade guided by the wool guild of Florence, the &quot;Arte della Lana&quot;. Like other families ruling in Italian , the Medici dominated their city&#x27;s government, were able to bring Florence under their family&#x27;s power, and created an environment in which art and humanism flourished. The Italian Renaissance was inspired by the Medici along with other families of Italy, such as the Visconti and Sforza in Milan, the Este in Ferrara, the Borgia and Della Rovere in Rome, and the Gonzaga in Mantua.

The Medici Bank, from when it was created in 1397 to its fall in 1494, was one of the most prosperous and respected institutions in Europe, and the Medici family was considered the wealthiest in Europe for a time. From this base, they acquired political power initially in Florence and later in wider Italy and Europe. They were among the earliest businesses to use the general ledger system of accounting through the development of the double-entry bookkeeping system for tracking credits and debits.

The Medici family financed the construction of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica and Florence Cathedral, and were patrons of Donatello, Brunelleschi, Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Machiavelli, Galileo, and Francesco Redi, among many others in the arts and sciences. They funded the invention of the piano, and arguably that of opera. They were also protagonists of the Counter-Reformation, from the beginning of the Reformation through the Council of Trent and the French Wars of Religion.

==History==
The Medici family came from the agricultural Mugello region north of Florence, and they are first mentioned in a document of 1230. The origin of the name is uncertain. &quot;Medici&quot; is the plural of &quot;medico&quot;, meaning &quot;medical doctor&quot;. The dynasty began with the founding of the Medici Bank in Florence in 1397.

===Rise to power===
For most of the 13th century, the leading banking centre in Italy was Siena. But in 1298, one of the leading banking families of Europe, the Bonsignoris, went bankrupt, and the city of Siena lost its status as the banking centre of Italy to Florence. Until the late 14th century, the leading family of Florence was the House of Albizzi. In 1293, the Ordinances of Justice were enacted; effectively, they became the constitution of the Republic of Florence throughout the Italian Renaissance. The city&#x27;s numerous luxurious palazzi were becoming surrounded by townhouses built by the prospering merchant class.

The main challengers to the Albizzi family were the Medici, first under Giovanni di Bicci de&#x27; Medici, later under his son Cosimo di Giovanni de&#x27; Medici and great-grandson, Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici. The Medici controlled the Medici Bank—then Europe&#x27;s largest bank—and an array of other enterprises in Florence and elsewhere. In 1433, the Albizzi managed to have Cosimo exiled. The next year, however, a pro-Medici Signoria (civic government) led by Tommaso Soderini, Oddo Altoviti and Lucca Pitti was elected and Cosimo returned. The Medici became the city&#x27;s leading family, a position they would hold for the next three centuries. Florence remained a republic until 1537, traditionally marking the end of the High Renaissance in Florence, but the instruments of republican government were firmly under the control of the Medici and their allies, save during intervals after 1494 and 1527. Cosimo and Lorenzo rarely held official posts but were the unquestioned leaders.

The Medici family was connected to most other elite families of the time through marriages of convenience, partnerships, or employment, so the family had a central position in the social network: several families had systematic access to the rest of the elite families only through the Medici, perhaps similar to banking relationships. Some examples of these families include the Bardi, Altoviti, Ridolfi, Cavalcanti and the Tornabuoni. This has been suggested as a reason for the rise of the Medici family.

Members of the family rose to some prominence in the early 14th century in the wool trade, especially with France and Spain. Despite the presence of some Medici in the city&#x27;s government institutions, they were still far less notable than other outstanding families such as the Albizzi or the Strozzi. One Salvestro de&#x27; Medici was speaker of the woolmakers&#x27; guild during the Ciompi revolt of 1378–1382, and one Antonio de&#x27; Medici was exiled from Florence in 1396. Involvement in another plot in 1400 caused all branches of the family to be banned from Florentine politics for twenty years, with the exception of two.

===15th century===
Giovanni di Bicci de&#x27; Medici (c. 1360–1429), son of Averardo de&#x27; Medici (1320–1363), increased the wealth of the family through his creation of the Medici Bank, and became one of the richest men in the city of Florence. Although he never held any political office, he gained strong popular support for the family through his support for the introduction of a proportional system of taxation. Giovanni&#x27;s son Cosimo the Elder, (father of the country), took over in 1434 as gran maestro (the unofficial head of the Florentine Republic).
The Medici additionally benefited from the discovery of vast deposits of alum in Tolfa in 1461. Alum is essential as a mordant in the dyeing of certain cloths and was used extensively in Florence, where the main industry was textile manufacturing. Before the Medici, the Turks were the only exporters of alum, so Europe was forced to buy from them until the discovery in Tolfa. Pius II granted the Medici family a monopoly on the mining there, making them the primary producers of alum in Europe.

Three successive generations of the Medici—Cosimo, Piero, and Lorenzo—ruled over Florence through the greater part of the 15th century. They clearly dominated Florentine representative government without abolishing it altogether. These three members of the Medici family had great skills in the management of so &quot;restive and independent a city&quot; as Florence. When Lorenzo died in 1492, however, his son Piero proved quite incapable of responding successfully to challenges caused by the French invasion of Italy in 1492, and within two years, he and his supporters were forced into exile and replaced with a republican government.

Piero de&#x27; Medici (1416–1469), Cosimo&#x27;s son, was only in power for five years (1464–1469). He was called &quot;Piero the Gouty&quot; because of the gout that pained his foot and led to his death. Unlike his father, Piero had little interest in the arts. Due to his illness, he mostly stayed at home bedridden, and therefore did little to further the Medici control of Florence while in power. As such, Medici rule stagnated until the next generation, when Piero&#x27;s son Lorenzo took over.

Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici (1449–1492), called &quot;the Magnificent&quot;, was more capable of leading and ruling a city, but he neglected the family banking business, which led to its ultimate ruin. To ensure the continuance of his family&#x27;s success, Lorenzo planned his children&#x27;s future careers for them. He groomed the headstrong Piero II to follow as his successor in civil leadership; Giovanni (future Pope Leo X) was placed in the church at an early age; and his daughter Maddalena was provided with a sumptuous dowry to make a politically advantageous marriage to a son of Pope Innocent VIII that cemented the alliance between the Medici and the Roman branches of the Cybo and Altoviti families.

The Pazzi conspiracy of 1478 was an attempt to depose the Medici family by killing Lorenzo with his younger brother Giuliano during Easter services; the assassination attempt ended with the death of Giuliano and an injured Lorenzo. The conspiracy involved the Pazzi and Salviati families, both rival banking families seeking to end the influence of the Medici, as well as the priest presiding over the church services, the Archbishop of Pisa, and even Pope Sixtus IV to a degree. The conspirators approached Sixtus IV in the hopes of gaining his approval, as he and the Medici had a long rivalry themselves, but the pope gave no official sanction to the plan. Despite his refusal of official approval, the pope nonetheless allowed the plot to proceed without interfering, and, after the failed assassination of Lorenzo, also gave dispensation for crimes done in the service of the church. After this, Lorenzo adopted his brother&#x27;s illegitimate son Giulio de&#x27; Medici (1478–1535), the future Pope Clement VII. Lorenzo&#x27;s son Piero II took over as the head of Florence after Lorenzo&#x27;s death. The Medici were expelled from Florence from 1494 to 1512 after Piero acceded to all of the demands of invader Charles VIII of France.

===16th century===
The exile of the Medici lasted until 1512, after which the &quot;senior&quot; branch of the family—those descended from Cosimo the Elder—were able to rule until the assassination of Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, first Duke of Florence, in 1537. This century-long rule was interrupted only on two occasions (between 1494–1512 and 1527–1530), when anti-Medici factions took control of Florence. Following the assassination of Duke Alessandro, power passed to the &quot;junior&quot; Medici branch—those descended from Lorenzo the Elder, the youngest son of Giovanni di Bicci, starting with his great-great-grandson Cosimo I &quot;the Great&quot;.

Cosimo the Elder and his father started the Medici foundations in banking and manufacturing—including a form of franchises. The family&#x27;s influence grew with its patronage of wealth, art, and culture. Ultimately, it reached its zenith in the papacy and continued to flourish for centuries afterward as Dukes of Florence and Tuscany. At least half, probably more, of Florence&#x27;s people were employed by the Medici and their foundational branches in business.

====Medici popes====

The Medici briefly became leaders of Western Christendom through their two famous 16th century popes, Leo X and Clement VII. Both also served as &quot;de facto&quot; political rulers of Rome, Florence, and large swaths of Italy known as the Papal States. They were generous patrons of the arts who commissioned masterpieces such as Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Transfiguration&quot; and Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;The Last Judgment&quot;; however, their reigns coincided with troubles for the Vatican, including Martin Luther&#x27;s Protestant Reformation and the infamous sack of Rome in 1527.

Leo X&#x27;s fun-loving pontificate bankrupted Vatican coffers and accrued massive debts. From Leo&#x27;s election as pope in 1513 to his death in 1521, Florence was overseen, in turn, by Giuliano de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Nemours, Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Urbino, and Giulio de&#x27; Medici, the latter of whom became Pope Clement VII.

Clement VII&#x27;s tumultuous pontificate was dominated by a rapid succession of political crises—many long in the making—that resulted in the sack of Rome by the armies of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in 1527 and rise of the Salviati, Altoviti and Strozzi as the leading bankers of the Roman Curia. From the time of Clement&#x27;s election as pope in 1523 until the sack of Rome, Florence was governed by the young Ippolito de&#x27; Medici (future cardinal and vice-chancellor of the Holy Roman Church), Alessandro de&#x27; Medici (future duke of Florence), and their guardians. In 1530, after allying himself with Charles V, Pope Clement VII succeeded in securing the engagement of Charles V&#x27;s daughter Margeret of Austria to his illegitimate nephew (reputedly his son) Alessandro de&#x27; Medici. Clement also convinced Charles V to name Alessandro as Duke of Florence. Thus began the reign of Medici monarchs in Florence, which lasted two centuries.
After securing Alessandro de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s dukedom, Pope Clement VII married off his first cousin, twice removed, Catherine de&#x27; Medici, to the son of Emperor Charles V&#x27;s arch-enemy, King Francis I of France—the future King Henry II. This led to the transfer of Medici blood, through Catherine&#x27;s daughters, to the royal family of Spain through Elisabeth of Valois, and the House of Lorraine through Claude of Valois.

In 1534, following a lengthy illness, Pope Clement VII died—and with him the stability of the Medici&#x27;s &quot;senior&quot; branch. In 1535, Ippolito Cardinal de&#x27; Medici died under mysterious circumstances. In 1536, Alessandro de&#x27; Medici married Charles V&#x27;s daughter, Margaret of Austria; however, the following year he was assassinated by a resentful cousin, Lorenzino de&#x27; Medici. The deaths of Alessandro and Ippolito enabled the Medici&#x27;s &quot;junior&quot; branch to lead Florence.

====Medici Dukes====
Another outstanding figure of the 16th-century Medici family was Cosimo I, who rose from relatively modest beginnings in the Mugello to attain supremacy over the whole of Tuscany. Against the opposition of Catherine de&#x27; Medici, Pope Paul III and their allies, he prevailed in various battles to conquer Florence&#x27;s hated rival Siena and found the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Cosimo purchased a portion of the island of Elba from the Republic of Genoa and based the Tuscan navy there. He died in 1574, succeeded by his eldest surviving son Francesco, whose death without male heirs led to the succession of his younger brother, Ferdinando, in 1587. Francesco married Johanna of Austria, and with his consort produced Eleonora de&#x27; Medici, Duchess of Mantua, and Marie de&#x27; Medici, Queen of France and Navarre. Through Marie, all succeeding French monarchs (bar the Napoleons) were descended from Francesco.

Ferdinando eagerly assumed the government of Tuscany. He commanded the draining of the Tuscan marshlands, built a road network in southern Tuscany and cultivated trade in Livorno. To augment the Tuscan silk industry, he oversaw the planting of mulberry trees along the major roads (silk worms feed on mulberry leaves). In foreign affairs, he shifted Tuscany away from Habsburg hegemony by marrying the first non-Habsburg marriage candidate since Alessandro, Christina of Lorraine, a granddaughter of Catherine de&#x27; Medici. The Spanish reaction was to construct a citadel on their portion of the island of Elba. To strengthen the new Franco-Tuscan alliance, he married his niece, Marie, to Henry IV of France. Henry explicitly stated that he would defend Tuscany from Spanish aggression, but later reneged, after which Ferdinando was forced to marry his heir, Cosimo, to Maria Maddalena of Austria to assuage Spain (where Maria Maddalena&#x27;s sister Margaret was the incumbent Queen consort). Ferdinando also sponsored a Tuscan expedition to the New World with the intention of establishing a Tuscan colony, an enterprise that brought no result for permanent colonial acquisitions.

Despite all of these incentives for economic growth and prosperity, the population of Florence at the dawn of the 17th century was a mere 75,000, far smaller than the other capitals of Italy (i.e., Rome, Milan, Venice, Palermo, and Naples). Francesco and Ferdinando, due to lax distinction between Medici and Tuscan state property, are thought to have been wealthier than their ancestor, Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, the founder of the dynasty. The Grand Duke alone had the prerogative to exploit the state&#x27;s mineral and salt resources, and the fortunes of the Medici were directly tied to the Tuscan economy.

===17th century===
Ferdinando, although no longer a cardinal, exercised much influence at successive conclaves. In 1605, Ferdinando succeeded in getting his candidate, Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, elected Pope Leo XI. He died the same month, but his successor, Pope Paul V, was also pro-Medici. Ferdinando&#x27;s pro-papal foreign policy, however, had drawbacks. Tuscany was overrun with religious orders, not all of whom were obliged to pay taxes. Ferdinando died in 1609, leaving an affluent realm; his inaction in international affairs, however, would have long-reaching consequences down the line.

In France, Marie de&#x27; Medici was acting as regent for her son, Louis XIII. Louis repudiated her pro-Habsburg policy in 1617. She lived the rest of her life deprived of any political influence.

Ferdinando&#x27;s successor, Cosimo II, reigned for less than 12 years. He married Maria Maddalena of Austria, with whom he had his eight children, including Margherita de&#x27; Medici, Ferdinando II de&#x27; Medici, and an Anna de&#x27; Medici.
He is most remembered as the patron of astronomer Galileo Galilei, whose 1610 treatise, Sidereus Nuncius, was dedicated to him. Cosimo died of consumption (tuberculosis) in 1621.

Cosimo&#x27;s elder son, Ferdinando, was not yet of legal maturity to succeed him, thus Maria Maddalena and his grandmother, Christina of Lorraine, acted as regents. Their collective regency is known as the &quot;Turtici&quot;. Maria Maddelana&#x27;s temperament was analogous to Christina&#x27;s, and together they aligned Tuscany with the papacy, re-doubled the Tuscan clergy, and allowed the heresy trial of Galileo Galilei to occur. Upon the death of the last Duke of Urbino (Francesco Maria II), instead of claiming the duchy for Ferdinando, who was married to the Duke of Urbino&#x27;s granddaughter and heiress, Vittoria della Rovere, they permitted it to be annexed by Pope Urban VIII. In 1626, they banned any Tuscan subject from being educated outside the Grand Duchy, a law later overturned, but resurrected by Maria Maddalena&#x27;s grandson, Cosimo III. Harold Acton, an Anglo-Italian historian, ascribed the decline of Tuscany to the &quot;Turtici&quot; regency.

Grand Duke Ferdinado was obsessed with new technology, and had a variety of hygrometers, barometers, thermometers, and telescopes installed in the Palazzo Pitti. In 1657, Leopoldo de&#x27; Medici, the Grand Duke&#x27;s youngest brother, established the Accademia del Cimento, organized to attract scientists to Florence from all over Tuscany for mutual study.

Tuscany participated in the Wars of Castro (the last time Medicean Tuscany proper was involved in a conflict) and inflicted a defeat on the forces of Pope Urban VIII in 1643. The war effort was costly and the treasury so empty because of it that when the Castro mercenaries were paid for, the state could no longer afford to pay interest on government bonds, with the result that the interest rate was lowered by 0.75%. At that time, the economy was so decrepit that barter trade became prevalent in rural market places.

Ferdinando died on 23 May 1670 afflicted by apoplexy and dropsy. He was interred in the Basilica of San Lorenzo, the Medici&#x27;s necropolis. At the time of his death, the population of the grand duchy was 730,594; the streets were lined with grass and the buildings on the verge of collapse in Pisa.

Ferdinando&#x27;s marriage to Vittoria della Rovere produced two children: Cosimo III de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Francesco Maria de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Rovere and Montefeltro. Upon Vittoria&#x27;s death in 1694, her allodial possessions, the Duchies of Rovere and Montefeltro, passed to her younger son.

===18th century: the fall of the dynasty===

Cosimo III married Marguerite Louise d&#x27;Orléans, a granddaughter of Henry IV of France and Marie de&#x27; Medici. An exceedingly discontented pairing, this union produced three children, notably Anna Maria Luisa de&#x27; Medici, Electress Palatine, and the last Medicean Grand Duke of Tuscany, Gian Gastone de&#x27; Medici.

Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine, Anna Maria Luisa&#x27;s spouse, successfully requisitioned the dignity &quot;Royal Highness&quot; for the Grand Duke and his family in 1691, despite the fact that they had no claim to any kingdom. Cosimo frequently paid the Holy Roman Emperor, his nominal feudal overlord, exorbitant dues, and he sent munitions to the emperor during the Battle of Vienna.

The Medici lacked male heirs, and by 1705, the grand ducal treasury was virtually bankrupt. In comparison to the 17th century, the population of Florence declined by 50%, and the population of the grand duchy as a whole declined by an estimated 40%. Cosimo desperately tried to reach a settlement with the European powers, but Tuscany&#x27;s legal status was very complicated: the area of the grand duchy formerly comprising the Republic of Siena was technically a Spanish fief, while the territory of the old Republic of Florence was thought to be under imperial suzerainty. Upon the death of his first son, Cosimo contemplated restoring the Florentine republic, either upon Anna Maria Luisa&#x27;s death, or on his own, if he predeceased her. The restoration of the republic would entail resigning Siena to the Holy Roman Empire, but, regardless, it was vehemently endorsed by his government. Europe largely ignored Cosimo&#x27;s plan. Only Great Britain and the Dutch Republic gave any credence to it, and the plan ultimately died with Cosimo III in 1723.

On 4 April 1718, Great Britain, France and the Dutch Republic (also later, Austria) selected Don Carlos of Spain, the elder child of Elisabeth Farnese and Philip V of Spain, as the Tuscan heir. By 1722, the electress was not even acknowledged as heiress, and Cosimo was reduced to spectator at the conferences for Tuscany&#x27;s future. On 25 October 1723, six days before his death, Grand Duke Cosimo disseminated a final proclamation commanding that Tuscany stay independent: Anna Maria Luisa would succeed uninhibited to Tuscany after Gian Gastone, and the grand duke reserved the right to choose his successor. However, these portions of his proclamation were completely ignored, and he died a few days later.

Gian Gastone despised the electress for engineering his catastrophic marriage to Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg; while she abhorred her brother&#x27;s liberal policies, he repealed all of his father&#x27;s anti-Semitic statutes. Gian Gastone revelled in upsetting her. On 25 October 1731, a Spanish detachment occupied Florence on behalf of Don Carlos, who disembarked in Tuscany in December of the same year.
The &quot;Ruspanti&quot;, Gian Gastone&#x27;s decrepit entourage, loathed the electress, and she them. Duchess Violante of Bavaria, Gian Gastone&#x27;s sister-in-law, tried to withdraw the grand duke from the sphere of influence of the &quot;Ruspanti&quot; by organising banquets. His conduct at the banquets was less than regal; he often vomited repeatedly into his napkin, belched, and regaled those present with socially inappropriate jokes. Following a sprained ankle in 1731, he remained confined to his bed for the rest of his life. The bed, often smelling of faeces, was occasionally cleaned by Violante.

In 1736, following the War of the Polish Succession, Don Carlos was disbarred from Tuscany, and Francis III of Lorraine was made heir in his stead. In January 1737, the Spanish troops withdrew from Tuscany, and were replaced by Austrians.

Gian Gastone died on 9 July 1737, surrounded by prelates and his sister. Anna Maria Luisa was offered a nominal regency by the Prince de Craon until the new grand duke could peregrinate to Tuscany, but declined. Upon her brother&#x27;s death, she received all the House of Medici&#x27;s allodial possessions.

Anna Maria Luisa signed the &quot;Patto di Famiglia&quot; (&quot;family pact&quot;) on 31 October 1737. In collaboration with the Holy Roman Emperor and Grand Duke Francis of Lorraine, she willed all the personal property of the Medici to the Tuscan state, provided that nothing was ever removed from Florence.

The &quot;Lorrainers&quot;, as the occupying forces were called, were popularly loathed, but the regent, the Prince de Craon, allowed the electress to live unperturbed in the Palazzo Pitti. She occupied herself with financing and overseeing the construction of the Basilica of San Lorenzo, started in 1604 by Ferdinando I, at a cost to the state of 1,000 crowns per week.

The electress donated much of her fortune to charity: £4,000 a month. On 19 February 1743, she died, and the grand ducal line of the House of Medici died with her. The Florentines grieved her, and she was interred in the crypt that she helped to complete, San Lorenzo.

The extinction of the main Medici dynasty and the accession in 1737 of Francis Stephen, Duke of Lorraine and husband of Maria Theresa of Austria, led to Tuscany&#x27;s temporary inclusion in the territories of the Austrian crown. The line of the Princes of Ottajano, an extant branch of the House of Medici who were eligible to inherit the grand duchy of Tuscany when the last male of the senior branch died in 1737, could have carried on as Medici sovereigns but for the intervention of Europe&#x27;s major powers, which allocated the sovereignty of Florence elsewhere.

As a consequence, the grand duchy expired and the territory became a secundogeniture of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty. The first grand duke of the new dynasty, Francis I, was a great-great-great-grandson of Francesco I de&#x27; Medici, thus he continued the Medicean Dynasty on the throne of Tuscany through the female line. The Habsburgs were deposed in favor of the House of Bourbon-Parma in 1801 (themselves deposed in 1807), but were later restored at the Congress of Vienna. Tuscany became a province of the United Kingdom of Italy in 1861. However, several extant branches of the House of Medici survive, including the Princes of Ottajano, the Medici Tornaquinci, and the Verona Medici Counts of Caprara and Gavardo. (see Medici family tree)

==Legacy==

The greatest accomplishments of the Medici were in the sponsorship of art and architecture, mainly early and High Renaissance art and architecture. The Medici were responsible for a high proportion of the major Florentine works of art created during their period of rule. Their support was critical, since artists generally began work on their projects only after they had received commissions. Giovanni di Bicci de&#x27; Medici, the first patron of the arts in the family, aided Masaccio and commissioned Filippo Brunelleschi for the reconstruction of the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence in 1419. Cosimo the Elder&#x27;s notable artistic associates were Donatello and Fra Angelico. In later years the most significant protégé of the Medici family was Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564), who produced work for a number of family members, beginning with Lorenzo the Magnificent, who was said to be extremely fond of the young Michelangelo and invited him to study the family collection of antique sculpture. Lorenzo also served as patron to Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) for seven years. Indeed, Lorenzo was an artist in his own right and an author of poetry and song; his support of the arts and letters is seen as a high point in Medici patronage.
After Lorenzo&#x27;s death the puritanical Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola rose to prominence, warning Florentines against excessive luxury. Under Savonarola&#x27;s fanatical leadership many great works were &quot;voluntarily&quot; destroyed in the Bonfire of the Vanities (February 7, 1497). The following year, on 23 May 1498, Savonarola and two young supporters were burned at the stake in the Piazza della Signoria, the same location as his bonfire. In addition to commissions for art and architecture, the Medici were prolific collectors and today their acquisitions form the core of the Uffizi museum in Florence. In architecture, the Medici were responsible for some notable features of Florence, including the Uffizi Gallery, the Boboli Gardens, the Belvedere, the Medici Chapel and the Palazzo Medici.

Later, in Rome, the Medici popes continued in the family tradition of patronizing artists in Rome. Pope Leo X would chiefly commission works from Raphael, whereas Pope Clement VII commissioned Michelangelo to paint the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel just before the pontiff&#x27;s death in 1534. Eleanor of Toledo, a princess of Spain and wife of Cosimo I the Great, purchased the Pitti Palace from Buonaccorso Pitti in 1550. Cosimo in turn patronized Vasari, who erected the Uffizi Gallery in 1560 and founded the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno – (&quot;Academy of the Arts of Drawing&quot;) in 1563. Marie de&#x27; Medici, widow of Henry IV of France and mother of Louis XIII, is the subject of a commissioned cycle of paintings known as the Marie de&#x27; Medici cycle, painted for the Luxembourg Palace by court painter Peter Paul Rubens in 1622–23.

Although none of the Medici themselves were scientists, the family is well known to have been the patrons of the famous Galileo Galilei, who tutored multiple generations of Medici children and was an important figurehead for his patron&#x27;s quest for power. Galileo&#x27;s patronage was eventually abandoned by Ferdinando II, when the Inquisition accused Galileo of heresy. However, the Medici family did afford the scientist a safe haven for many years. Galileo named the four largest moons of Jupiter after four Medici children he tutored, although the names Galileo used are not the names currently used.

==Main genealogical table==
The table below shows the origins of the Medici:


This extract shows the branch that gave rise to the celebrated branch of the Medici descending from Giovanni &quot;di Bicci&quot;, who founded the Medici fortunes:

This is the branch of Cosimo&#x27;s brother, Lorenzo, called the &quot;Popolano&quot; Branch, which gave rise to the Grand-Dukes of Tuscany:

==Coats of arms==
The origin of the Medici coat of arms is not recorded. One unproven story traces their ancestry to a knight of Charlemagne&#x27;s, Averardo, who defeated a giant, Mugello. In reward, Charlemagne is said to have rewarded Averardo with the shield mauled by the giant, with the dents in the shape of balls, and the giant&#x27;s lands in Mugello.

The simplest, though also unproven, theory suggests that the balls represented coins copied from the coat of arms of the Guild of Moneychangers (Arte del Cambio) to which the Medici belonged. That shield was red strewn with Byzantine coins (bezants). The number of balls also varied with time, as shown below. It has also been argued that these coins referenced the three coins or golden balls associated with St. Nicholas, particularly as the saint was invoked by Italian bankers as they took oaths.

As an Italian vocabulary word, &quot;medici&quot; means &quot;medical doctors&quot; and identifications with the family members as physicians may be found among their names as early as the eleventh century. Fanciful stories depict the images as pills or cupping glasses, a late-medieval medical instrument used to draw blood. Pills did not exist until much later and bloodletting was not a common practice at the time of the first Medici coat of arms. Art historian Rocky Ruggiero suggests plausibly however, that the images may represent whole ripe blood oranges that typically are grown in Italy. Although knowledge of vitamins did not exist at the time, the benefit of oranges for certain diseases was recognized and their association with recommendations by medical doctors suggests to Ruggiero that this likely is the imagery intended in the coats of arms for the Medici family.

Alternatively, it has been suggested that the Medici coat of arms was initially inspired by symbols drawn from Etruscan votive sculpture, examples of which feature an oval dome with balls (echoing the forms of the Medici shield), as well as six balls within a triangle (as found in the alternative, triangular version of the Medici emblem). This particular influence offers an explanation for the red hue of the Medici balls, the colour of the terracotta sculpture. It would also have reflected the family&#x27;s interest in Etruscan art and culture. In addition, the notion of Etruscan votive sculpture would have chimed with the participation of the Medici in the religious custom of offering up votive statues, a practice that recalled the ancient Etruscan convention of donating sculptures in the hope of, or gratitude for, divine favour. Such favours would have included the wish for a strong and healthy family, both for the supplicant and their descendants.

<doc id="44178" wikidata="Q257767" url="?curid=44178" title="Hanlon's razor">
<text>Hanlon&#x27;s razor is an adage or rule of thumb that states:

It is a philosophical razor that suggests a way of eliminating unlikely explanations for human behavior. It is probably named after a Robert J. Hanlon, who submitted the statement to &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Law Book Two: More Reasons Why Things Go Wrong!&quot; (1980). Similar statements have been recorded since at least the 18th century.

==Origin==
The adage was a submission credited in print to Robert J. Hanlon of Scranton, Pennsylvania, in a compilation of various jokes related to Murphy&#x27;s law published in Arthur Bloch&#x27;s &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Law Book Two: More Reasons Why Things Go Wrong!&quot; (1980).

A similar quotation appears in Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s novella &quot;Logic of Empire&quot; (1941). The character Doc in the story describes the &quot;devil theory&quot; fallacy, explaining, &quot;You have attributed conditions to villainy that simply result from stupidity.&quot;

Hanlon&#x27;s razor became well known after its inclusion in the &quot;Jargon File&quot;, a glossary of computer programmer slang, in 1990. Later that year, the &quot;Jargon File&quot; editors noted lack of knowledge of the term&#x27;s derivation and the existence of a similar epigram by William James, although this was possibly intended as a reference to William James Laidlay. In 1996, the &quot;Jargon File&quot; entry on Hanlon&#x27;s Razor noted the existence of the phrase in Heinlein&#x27;s novella, with speculation that Hanlon&#x27;s Razor might be a corruption of &quot;Heinlein&#x27;s Razor&quot;. The link to Murphy&#x27;s law was described in a pair of 2001 blog entries by Quentin Stafford-Fraser, citing emails from Joseph E. Bigler. In 2002, the &quot;Jargon File&quot; entry noted the same. The &quot;Jargon File&quot; now calls it a &quot;Murphyism&quot;.

The name was inspired by Occam&#x27;s razor.

==Exceptions==
Grey&#x27;s law (a humorous variant of Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s 3rd law): 

Douglas W. Hubbard quoted Hanlon&#x27;s razor and added &quot;a clumsier but more accurate corollary&quot;: 

==Other variations of the idea==
A variation appears in &quot;The Wheels of Chance&quot; (1896) by H.G. Wells: There is very little deliberate wickedness in the world. The stupidity of our selfishness gives much the same results indeed, but in the ethical laboratory it shows a different nature.

A similar quote is also misattributed to Napoleon. Andrew Roberts, in , quotes from Churchill&#x27;s correspondence with King George VI in February 1943 regarding disagreements with Charles De Gaulle: His &#x27;insolence ... may be founded on stupidity rather than malice.

<doc id="44179" wikidata="Q1280767" url="?curid=44179" title="Satellite temperature measurement">
<text>Satellite temperature measurements are inferences of the temperature of the atmosphere at various altitudes as well as sea and land surface temperatures obtained from radiometric measurements by satellites. These measurements can be used to locate weather fronts, monitor the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, determine the strength of tropical cyclones, study urban heat islands and monitor the global climate. Wildfires, volcanos, and industrial hot spots can also be found via thermal imaging from weather satellites.

Weather satellites do not measure temperature directly. They measure radiances in various wavelength bands. Since 1978 microwave sounding units (MSUs) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration polar orbiting satellites have measured the intensity of upwelling microwave radiation from atmospheric oxygen, which is related to the temperature of broad vertical layers of the atmosphere. Measurements of infrared radiation pertaining to sea surface temperature have been collected since 1967.

Satellite datasets show that over the past four decades the troposphere has warmed and the stratosphere has cooled. Both of these trends are consistent with the influence of increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.

==Principles== 
Satellites measure radiances in various wavelength bands, which must then be mathematically inverted to obtain indirect inferences of temperature. The resulting temperature profiles depend on details of the methods that are used to obtain temperatures from radiances. As a result, different groups that have analyzed the satellite data have produced differing temperature datasets.

The satellite time series is not homogeneous. It is constructed from a series of satellites with similar but not identical sensors. The sensors also deteriorate over time, and corrections are necessary for orbital drift and decay. Particularly large differences between reconstructed temperature series occur at the few times when there is little temporal overlap between successive satellites, making intercalibration difficult.

==Infrared measurements==
===Surface measurements===

Infrared radiation can be used to measure both the temperature of the surface (using &quot;window&quot; wavelengths to which the atmosphere is transparent), and the temperature of the atmosphere (using wavelengths for which the atmosphere is not transparent, or measuring cloud top temperatures in infrared windows).

Satellites used to retrieve surface temperatures via measurement of thermal infrared in general require cloud-free conditions. Some of the instruments include the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Along Track Scanning Radiometers (AASTR), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), and the ACE Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE‐FTS) on the Canadian SCISAT-1 satellite.

Weather satellites have been available to infer sea surface temperature (SST) information since 1967, with the first global composites occurring during 1970. Since 1982, satellites have been increasingly utilized to measure SST and have allowed its spatial and temporal variation to be viewed more fully. For example, changes in SST monitored via satellite have been used to document the progression of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation since the 1970s.

Over land the retrieval of temperature from radiances is harder, because of inhomogeneities in the surface. Studies have been conducted on the urban heat island effect via satellite imagery. By using the fractal technique, Weng, Q. et al. characterized the spatial pattern of urban heat island. Use of advanced very high resolution infrared satellite imagery can be used, in the absence of cloudiness, to detect density discontinuities (weather fronts) such as cold fronts at ground level. Using the Dvorak technique, infrared satellite imagery can be used to determine the temperature difference between the eye and the cloud top temperature of the central dense overcast of mature tropical cyclones to estimate their maximum sustained winds and their minimum central pressures.

Along Track Scanning Radiometers aboard weather satellites are able to detect wildfires, which show up at night as pixels with a greater temperature than . The Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard the Terra satellite can detect thermal hot spots associated with wildfires, volcanoes, and industrial hot spots.

The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder on the Aqua satellite, launched in 2002, uses infrared detection to measure near-surface temperature.

===Stratosphere measurements===

Stratospheric temperature measurements are made from the Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU) instruments, which are three-channel infrared (IR) radiometers. Since this measures infrared emission from carbon dioxide, the atmospheric opacity is higher and hence the temperature is measured at a higher altitude (stratosphere) than microwave measurements.

Since 1979 the Stratospheric sounding units (SSUs) on the NOAA operational satellites have provided near global stratospheric temperature data above the lower stratosphere.
The SSU is a far-infrared spectrometer employing a pressure modulation technique to make measurement in three channels in the 15 μm carbon dioxide absorption band. The three channels use the same frequency but different carbon dioxide cell pressure, the corresponding weighting functions peaks at 29 km for channel 1, 37 km for channel 2 and 45 km for channel 3.

The process of deriving trends from SSUs measurement has proved particularly difficult because of satellite drift, inter-calibration between different satellites with scant overlap and gas leaks in the instrument carbon dioxide pressure cells. Furthermore since the radiances measured by SSUs are due to emission by carbon dioxide the weighting functions move to higher altitudes as the carbon dioxide concentration in the stratosphere increase.
Mid to upper stratosphere temperatures shows a strong negative trend interspersed by transient volcanic warming after the explosive volcanic eruptions of El Chichón and Mount Pinatubo, little temperature trend has been observed since 1995.
The greatest cooling occurred in the tropical stratosphere consistent with enhanced Brewer-Dobson circulation under greenhouse gas concentrations increase.

Lower stratospheric cooling is mainly caused by the effects of ozone depletion with a possible contribution from increased stratospheric water vapor and greenhouse gases increase. There has been a decline in stratospheric temperatures, interspersed by warmings related to volcanic eruptions. Global Warming theory suggests that the stratosphere should cool while the troposphere warms.
 The long term cooling in the lower stratosphere occurred in two downward steps in temperature both after the transient warming related to explosive volcanic eruptions of El Chichón and Mount Pinatubo, this behavior of the global stratospheric temperature has been attributed to global ozone concentration variation in the two years following volcanic eruptions.
Since 1996 the trend is slightly positive due to ozone recovery juxtaposed to a cooling trend of 0.1K/decade that is consistent with the predicted impact of increased greenhouse gases.

The table below shows the stratospheric temperature trend from the SSU measurements in the three different bands, where negative trend indicated cooling.

==Microwave (tropospheric and stratospheric) measurements==

===Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) measurements===
From 1979 to 2005 the microwave sounding units (MSUs) and since 1998 the Advanced Microwave Sounding Units on NOAA polar orbiting weather satellites have measured the intensity of upwelling microwave radiation from atmospheric oxygen. The intensity is proportional to the temperature of broad vertical layers of the atmosphere. Upwelling radiance is measured at different frequencies; these different frequency bands sample a different weighted range of the atmosphere.

Figure 3 (right) shows the atmospheric levels sampled by different wavelength reconstructions from the satellite measurements, where TLS, TTS, and TTT represent three different wavelengths.

===Other microwave measurements===

A different technique is used by the Aura spacecraft, the Microwave Limb Sounder, which measure microwave emission horizontally, rather than aiming at the nadir.

Temperature measurements are also made by GPS radio occultation. This technique measures the refraction of the radio waves transmitted by GPS satellites as they propagate in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, thus allowing vertical temperature and moisture profiles to be measured.

==Temperature measurements on other planets==

Planetary science missions also make temperature measurements on other planets and moons of the solar system, using both infrared techniques (typical of orbiter and flyby missions of planets with solid surfaces) and microwave techniques (more often used for planets with atmospheres). Infrared temperature measurement instruments used in planetary missions include surface temperature measurements taken by the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) instrument on Mars Global Surveyor and the Diviner instrument on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter; and atmospheric temperature measurements taken by the composite infrared spectrometer instrument on the NASA Cassini spacecraft.

Microwave atmospheric temperature measurement instruments include the Microwave Radiometer on the Juno mission to Jupiter.
