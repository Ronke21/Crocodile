<text>The history of Brunei concerns the settlements and societies located on the north coast of the island of Borneo, which has been under the influence of Indianised kingdoms and empires for much of its history. Local scholars assume that the Islamisation of Brunei started in the fifteenth century with the formation of the Bruneian Empire, a thalassocracy that covered the northern part of Borneo and Sulu. At the end of the 17th century, Brunei subsequently entered a period of decline brought on by the Brunei Civil War, piracy, and European colonial expansion. Later, there was a brief war with Spain, in which Brunei evacuated its capital for a brief period until the Spanish withdrew. The empire lost much of its territory with the arrival of the Western powers, such as the Spanish in Luzon and Visayas and the British in Labuan, Sarawak, and North Borneo. The decline of the Bruneian Empire accelerated in the nineteenth century when Brunei gave much of its territory to the White Rajahs of Sarawak, resulting in its current small landmass and separation into two parts. Sultan Hashim Jalilul Alam Aqamaddin later appealed to the British to stop further annexation in 1888. In the same year, the British signed a &quot;Treaty of Protection&quot; and made Brunei a British protectorate until 1984 when it gained independence and prospered due to the discovery of oil.

== Prehistory ==
The earliest record of Bruneian people can be traced back to the presence of Austro-Melanesians around 40,000 B.C.E. in Niah Cave, Miri Division, Sarawak. The remains found there were linked to those found in Last Glacial Period. During the ice age, Borneo and Palawan were linked with each other.

After the sea level rose about 10,000 years ago, Southeast Asian territories were divided into two regions. The population there began to move around for various reasons. Hoabinhians, or Proto-Melanesians, then moved to Borneo and lived in Niah Cave until around 8,000 B.C.E.

The migration from Yangtze started to move toward Taiwan. Then, after Taiwan, the migration wave reached the Philippines via Palawan. After the migration wave reached Palawan, at least three groups began to form distinct communities. One group migrated toward Borneo, another group headed to Sulawesi, and the last moved to Java. The event lasted about a thousand years, between 4,000 and 3,000 B.C.E. The migration at this time signified the end of the bacsonian. Neolithic usage of pottery and cultivation of rice reached the Austronesians via the Philippines around 2,500 B.C.E. It reached Palawan, then went to Borneo around 2,300 B.C.E. and spread across Insulindia.

The Austronesians began to develop a faith or cosmology around megalithism and then started to build social structure and agriculture as people settled down and tried to cultivate the land. This Bronze Age cultural complex peaked around 600 B.C.E., centred in Dong Son village, thus called Dongsonian. The introduction of iron and bronze between 500 and 200 B.C.E. marked the end of neolithic cults and the start of Indian contact in S.E. Asia. The Indian trade brought beads of glass or stone to Borneo.

== Pre-Islamic Hindu-Buddhist Indianised kingdoms ==

The history of Brunei before the arrival of Magellan&#x27;s ships in 1519–1522 CE is based on speculation, the interpretation of Chinese sources, and local legends, unless otherwise proven by archaeology. Areas comprising what is now Brunei participated in the Maritime Jade Road, as ascertained by archeological research. The trading network existed for 3,000 years, between 2000 BC and 1000 AD, and was centered in Taiwan and the Philippines. 

Camphor and pepper seem to have been prized objects of trade. Brunei hard camphor had a wholesale value equivalent to its own weight in silver. Ming dynasty accounts give detailed information about visits and tribute missions by rulers of &quot;Poni&quot; (modern Mandarin pronunciation) during the late 14th and early 15th century. Their names and titles suggest either Hindu or Buddhist influence. The texts confirm that the state was tributary to the Hindu Javanese Majapahit Empire, but sought and received Chinese protection in 1408.
===Brunei in the legendary history of Panay island===

Datu Puti led some dissident datus from Borneo in a rebellion against Datu Makatunaw. The dissidents and their retinue established the rulership of a new country called Madyaas in Panay island. After the 10 datus established many towns in Panay and southern Luzon, Datu Makatunaw, who was a relative of Datu Puti, seized the properties and riches of the datus. The warriors named Labaw Dunggon and Paybari, after learning of this injustice from their father-in-law Paiburong, sailed to Udtuhan in Borneo where Makatunaw ruled. The warriors sacked the town, killed Makatunaw and his family, retrieved the stolen properties of the 10 datus, enslaved the remaining population of Udtuhan, and sailed back to Panay. Labaw Dunggon and his wife, Uhaytanayon, later settled in a place called Muruburo.

== Syair Awang Semaun epic ==

According to the official version of events, mainly the national epic poem &quot;Syair Awang Semaun&quot;, Brunei was founded by a band of fourteen saudara (brothers and first cousins) who eventually settled in the Brunei river near the present capital and chose one of their numbers as the first ruler. Some versions of the epic state that they were all the sons of Dewa Amas of Kayangan, a partially supernatural being who descended to earth at Ulu Limbang in an egg. Many Lundayeh / Lun Bawang believe that Awang Semaun is their ancestor&#x27;s grassroots because of Telur Aco.

Discovered by the Sang Aji, he was married to that ruler&#x27;s daughter by whom he fathered one son. He traveled to thirteen settlements in the region in search of an auspicious ox. At each of the villages, he fathered thirteen (or twenty-two) other sons by thirteen different aboriginal wives, daughters of the local penghulu.

The first ruler chosen by the saudara to rule the newly founded state was Awang Alak Betatar, the son of Dewa Amas and the Sang Aji&#x27;s daughter. He was not necessarily the eldest among them, but he was chosen to rule because of his fitness to do so. The official account states that he journeyed to Johor, embraced Islam, married the daughter of a Sultan &quot;Bahkei&quot; of Johor, and received the title of Sultan Muhammad Shah from him.

== Brunei in the 14th century ==
=== Early Sino-Koreanic influence ===
The largest river in the territory, the &quot;Kinabatangan&quot;, was believed to be named by earlier Chinese settlers which had a factory to collect birds nests, beche-de-mer, shark fins, Borneon camphor, pearl, and pearl shells for export to China. The productions of North and Northeast Borneo from early times attracted considerable attention from Chinese merchants.

One of the earliest Chinese records of an independent kingdom in Borneo is the 977 AD letter to the Chinese emperor from the ruler of Boni, which some scholars believe to refer to Borneo. The Bruneians regained their independence from Srivijaya due to the onset of a Javanese-Sumatran war. In 1225, the Chinese official Zhao Rukuo reported that Boni had 100 warships to protect its trade and that there was great wealth in the kingdom. Marco Polo suggested in his memoirs that the Great Khan or the ruler of the Mongol Empire, attempted and failed many times in invading &quot;Great Java&quot; which was the European name for Bruneian controlled Borneo.

During the early years of Ming Dynasty, the Emperor of China had sent two officers named Wang Kong and Ong Sum Ping to get the &quot;gemala&quot; (glowing orb) of the Dragon which lived on China Balu where the mountain&#x27;s name itself refers to the great number of Chinese lives lost being eaten by the Dragon. It is said that Ong Sum Ping later married Princess Ratna Dewi, the daughter of Sultan Muhammad Shah of Brunei. For that he was conferred the nobility title of Pengiran Maharaja Lela and elected Chief of Kinabatangan.

When the admiral Zheng He visited the Brunei in the early 15th century, he encountered a major trading port which included Chinese people who were actively trading with China.

=== Bruneian conquest of Borneo and the Philippines ===

According to Wang Zhenping, in the 1300s, &quot;the Yuan Dade nanhai zhi&quot; or &quot;Yuan dynasty Dade period southern sea records&quot; reported that Brunei administered Sarawak and Sabah as well as the Philippine kingdoms of: Butuan, Sulu, Ma-i (Mindoro), Malilu (Manila), Shahuchong (Siocon or Zamboanga), Yachen (Oton, once part of the Madja-as Kedatuan), and Wenduling (Mindanao), which would regain their independence at a later date. It eventually evolved to be called Pon-i and it was a vassal-state to the Javanese-centered Majapahit Empire.

=== Hindu Majapahit invasion of Borneo ===
In the 14th century, the Javanese manuscript &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot;, written by Prapanca in 1365, mentioned &quot;Barune&quot; as the constituent state of Hindu Majapahit, which had to make an annual tribute of 40 katis of camphor. In 1369, Sulu which was also formerly part of Majapahit, had successfully rebelled and then attacked Boni, and had invaded the Northeast Coast of Borneo and afterward had looted the capital of its treasure and gold including sacking two sacred pearls. A fleet from Majapahit succeeded in driving away the Sulus, but Boni was left weaker after the attack. A Chinese report from 1371 described Boni as poor and totally controlled by Majapahit.

== Islamization and establishment of the sultanate ==

By the 15th century, the empire became a Muslim state, when the King of Brunei, declared independence from Majapahit and converted to Islam, brought by Muslim Indians and Arab merchants from other parts of Maritime Southeast Asia, who came to trade and spread Islam. During the rule of Bolkiah, the fifth Sultan, the empire controlled the coastal areas of northwest Borneo (present-day Brunei, Sarawak and Sabah) and reached the Philippines at Sulu. In the 16th century, the Brunei empire&#x27;s influence also extended as far as Kapuas River delta in West Kalimantan.

Other sultanates in the area had close relations with the Royal House of Brunei, in some cases effectively under the hegemony of the Brunei ruling family for periods of time. These rulers included the Malay sultans of Pontianak, Samarinda, and Banjarmasin. The Malay Sultanate of Sambas in present-day West Kalimantan, the Sultanate of Sulu, and the Kingdom of Luzon had formed dynastic relations with the royal house of Brunei. The Sultanate of Sarawak (covering present-day Kuching, known to the Portuguese cartographers as &quot;Cerava,&quot; and one of the five great seaports on the island of Borneo), though under the influence of Brunei, was self-governed under Sultan Tengah before being fully integrated into the Bruneian Empire upon the Tengah&#x27;s death in 1641.

=== Relations with Europeans ===
Brunei&#x27;s relations varied with the different European powers in the region. 

==== Portuguese ====
The Portuguese, for the most part, were more interested in economic and trading relations with the regional powers and did little to interfere with Brunei&#x27;s development. This does not mean that relations were always cordial, such as in 1536 when the Portuguese attacked the Muslims in the Moluccas, and the ambassador to the Brunei court had to leave because of the sultan&#x27;s hostility. The Portuguese also noted that the sultanate was heavily involved in the region&#x27;s politics and wars, and that Brunei merchants could be found in Ligor and Siam.

==== Conflict with the Spanish Empire ====

Relations with Spain were far more hostile. From 1565 on, Spanish and Brunei forces engaged in a number of naval skirmishes, and in 1571, the Spanish who had been sending expeditions from Mexico succeeded in capturing Manila from the Brunei aristocracy that had been established there. Brunei raised several large fleets intending to recapture the city, but the campaigns, for various reasons, never launched. In 1578, the Spanish took Sulu and in April attacked and captured Brunei itself, after demanding that the sultan cease proselytising in the Philippines and, in turn, allow Christian missionaries to be active in his kingdom. The Spaniards withdrew after suffering heavy losses due to a cholera or dysentery outbreak. They were so weakened by the illness that they decided to abandon Brunei to return to Manila on 26 June 1578, after just 72 days. The short-term damage to the sultanate was minimal, as Sulu regained its independence soon after. However, Brunei failed to regain a foothold in Luzon, with the island firmly in Spanish hands. The Bruneians in their war against Spain, were supported by Lascars and the Ottoman Caliphate. The Spanish were aware of this and complained to their king relating how Turks and even Granadans (From the Emirate of Granada) assisted Borneans in their war against Spain. Muslim migration from the Ottoman Caliphate, Egypt, Mecca and Arabia was so constant Melchor Davalos complained to the Spanish King of their presence in Borneo and the Philippines.

To counteract Ottoman assistance to the Bruneians, Spain levied soldiers from their vassal states in Peru and Mexico, to supplement the Spanish troops sent to the Philippines. However, the Bruneian-Spanish conflict eventually, died down.

The long-term effects of regional changes could not be avoided. After Sultan Hassan, Brunei entered a period of decline, due to internal battles over royal succession as well as the rising influences of European colonial powers in the region, that, among other things, disrupted traditional trading patterns, destroying the economic base of Brunei and many other Southeast Asian sultanates.

==== Relationship with the British and Sarawak ====
During Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II&#x27;s reign, disturbances occurred in Sarawak. In 1839, the British adventurer James Brooke arrived in Borneo and helped the Sultan put down this rebellion.

As a reward, he became governor and later &quot;White Rajah&quot; of Sarawak and gradually expanded the territory under his control. Brooke never gained control of Brunei, though he did attempt to. He asked the British to check whether or not it would be acceptable for him to claim Brunei as his own; however, they said although Brunei was poorly governed, it had a definite sense of national identity and therefore could not be absorbed by Brooke.

In 1843 an open conflict between Brooke and the Sultan ended in the latter&#x27;s defeat. The Sultan recognised Sarawak&#x27;s independence. In 1846, Brunei Town was attacked and captured by the British, and Sultan Saifuddin II was forced to sign a treaty to end the British occupation of Brunei Town. In the same year, Sultan Saifuddin II ceded Labuan to the British under the Treaty of Labuan. In 1847, he signed the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce with the British, and in 1850, he signed a similar treaty with the United States, which, after a series of events, resulted in the first consul of the US, Charles Lee Moses, burning down his consulate. Over the years, the Sultans of Brunei ceded further stretches of territory to Sarawak; in 1877, stretches to the east of the capital were leased (later ceded) to the British North Borneo Chartered Company (North Borneo). Eventually, due to these seizures of territory, which was accepted by the sultan for annual lease payments, the British occupied the vast majority of the coast of Brunei. The Sultan only stopped handing over territory when Sarawak asked for Limbang, which the Sultan refused. Against the Sultan&#x27;s wishes, Sarawak obtained control over the territory.

== British protectorate of Brunei ==

The term &quot;Brunei Protectorate&quot; or &quot;British Protectorate of Brunei&quot; was used to describe a British Protected State of the United Kingdom that encompassed what is modern-day Brunei. The 1905–1906 Supplementary Treaty created a British Resident, whose counsel was obligatory on behalf of the Sultan in all domains, save Islamic ones. The Resident became the most powerful person in the Sultanate as a result of this system, which essentially gave him substantial administrative authority equivalent to that of a Chief Justice and Menteri Besar combined. The Resident appointed four district officers who answered directly to him, supervising all aspects of administration. He also had the power to appoint traditional authorities like &quot;penghulu&quot; and &quot;ketua kampong&quot;. 

=== Treaty of Protection and decline ===
Significant changes in Brunei&#x27;s history occurred as a result of Britain&#x27;s efforts to increase its influence in the area in the late 19th century in reaction to geopolitical worries about the German Empire and the United States. A significant turning point for Brunei was reached when Sultan Hashim Jalilul Alam Aqamaddin and the British government signed the Treaty of Protection with Sir Hugh Low on 17 September 1888, with the intention of obtaining security assurances from Lord Salisbury. Due to this treaty, Brunei&#x27;s foreign affairs were essentially handed over to Britain, preventing the Sultan from holding direct talks with North Borneo and Sarawak, two nearby states.

However, only two years later, in March 1890, Charles Brooke&#x27;s annexation of Limbang exposed the treaty&#x27;s shortcomings and significantly weakened Brunei&#x27;s sovereignty. Although Brunei was meant to be protected, the Treaty of Protection allowed the British to prioritise their geopolitical interests, resulting in more territorial expansions and internal challenges for Brunei. Sultan Hashim&#x27;s disappointment with British support peaked in 1902 when he sent a heartfelt letter to King Edward VII, lamenting the lack of assistance his country had received since signing the treaty and the mounting difficulties it faced.

In early 1901, the resurgence of violence in Tutong forced the British Foreign Office to reassess its stance on Brunei. Sultan Hashim&#x27;s leadership was criticised by many British officials, and sentiment in the region began to shift toward Sarawak&#x27;s government, which was perceived as offering more equitable taxes and better administration of Brunei&#x27;s shrinking territory. Concerns raised by Chinese traders about governance further portrayed Brunei as economically fragile and unstable. Despite these challenges, Sultan Hashim remained committed to preserving Brunei&#x27;s independence, even as financial strains worsened.

In 1901, Sultan Hashim&#x27;s financial situation deteriorated, leading him to borrow $10,000 from Brooke for household expenses. Amidst these difficulties, he arranged a lavish royal wedding for his grandson to strengthen political ties. However, the Sultan firmly rejected Brooke and Hewett&#x27;s proposal to cede the Belait and Tutong districts, concerned for the future of his dynasty. As his dissatisfaction with British administration grew, Sultan Hashim expressed his willingness in 1903 to transfer Brunei to the Ottoman Empire due to what he saw as the oppression of Islam and the loss of territory. Efforts to transfer Brunei to Sarawak ultimately failed after a smallpox epidemic in 1904 claimed the lives of the newlywed couple.

=== McArthur&#x27;s report and impact ===

The Report On Brunei produced by Malcolm McArthur after his 1904 expedition in Brunei was crucial in changing British perspectives toward the sultanate. Unlike previous assessments, McArthur&#x27;s report offered a more balanced view, recognising Sultan Hashim&#x27;s dignity and the challenges he faced. It highlighted the Sultan&#x27;s feelings of abandonment and despair, providing a deeper understanding of his situation. McArthur&#x27;s findings played a key role in shaping future interactions and governance in Brunei.

Sultan Hashim agreed to McArthur&#x27;s proposal to establish a British Residency system in Brunei. The Sultan and his Wazirs signed the 1905–1906 Supplementary Treaty, which was formalised in early 1906 during Sir John Anderson&#x27;s visit. Anderson praised McArthur for his reliable leadership, emphasizing its importance for Brunei&#x27;s future. Sultan Hashim expressed his relief, thanking Anderson for his assurances regarding Brunei&#x27;s Islamic status, reflecting the Sultan&#x27;s efforts to protect Brunei through diplomatic agreements.

The Wazirs saw a decrease in importance during British administration, primarily due to land reforms that impacted their means of survival and customary authority. After 1906, Sultan Hashim&#x27;s standing as the head of state became more symbolic, while actual authority shifted significantly. The establishment of the British Residency marked a new era, where the British Resident took on the role of governance. Sultan Hashim faced ongoing challenges that resulted in the loss of important regions and severe poverty, affecting both the palace and the general public.

=== Symbolic authority and Japanese occupation ===
Except in questions of religion and custom, Sultan Muhammad Jamalul Alam II&#x27;s executive powers were passed to the British Resident with the implementation of the British Residency system. Under his rule, he promoted Chinese settlement for their economic talents and oversaw the adoption of syariah law in Brunei with the 1913 Marriage and Divorce Act and the 1912 Mohammedan Laws Enactment, which superseded the Kanun Brunei.

During his reign, Brunei participated in the Malay and Borneo Cultural Festival in 1922, when he became the first Sultan to visit Singapore, escorted by traditional musicians. Additionally, in 1909, he became the first Sultan to have his palace moved from Kampong Ayer to land. The first crude oil find in Brunei was discovered in the same year, although significant oil strikes did not occur until 1927. The Sultan also welcomed the Prince of Wales on 18 May 1922, showcasing the Sultanate&#x27;s regal traditions.

After his father&#x27;s death, Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin assumed the throne and was marked by a more cautious attitude than his predecessor. He often relied on international consultants over local leaders, like Gerard MacBryan, indicative of his ongoing reliance on outside influence. To show his dissatisfaction with Brunei&#x27;s structure, he often skipped State Council sessions between 1931 and 1950. He selected a competent personal assistant to help him navigate governance. Even though he became the first Sultan to attain complete sovereignty in 1931 at the age of 18, he later went to England to improve his language skills.

Despite worries over the distribution of income from oil exports, Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin worked to strengthen financial rules for Brunei&#x27;s residents. He was well known for his hospitality to visitors, particularly high-ranking officials. He attempted to build links throughout his rule, including a notable effort to wed the daughter of the Sultan of Selangor, which strengthened the bonds between the two royal houses. However, by the late 1930s, his relationship with the British worsened, reflecting greater issues in Brunei&#x27;s political environment and governance under colonial rule.
In order to foster local governance, Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin pushed for the recruitment of 25 Bruneians to higher posts in the Brunei Administrative Service (BAS). This resulted in their appointment to the government bureaucracy in 1941. In an effort to further Islamic education, he founded a private Arabic school in 1940. It was forced to close in 1942 due to Japanese occupation. Sultan backed the creation of regional defence units, such as the Brunei Volunteer Force, to help the British repel a Japanese invasion as tensions with Japan increased. But as the occupation progressed, his position became mostly symbolic, with the Japanese province governor holding actual authority. In spite of this, he was able to retake several areas that Brunei had previously lost, indicating a long-standing intention to take back control of these regions.

The Sultan had little real influence during the occupation, but his status was preserved so the Japanese could win over the locals. He was given decorations and a salary upon the country&#x27;s surrender to the Japanese Army during World War II in December 1941, although his main role was that of ceremonial commander. Locals began to oppose the Japanese administration more and more, especially as food shortages got severe. Local authorities concealed the Sultan in order to shield him and his family from the increasing violence. He was greeted as a hero upon his return when Australian forces liberated Brunei in June 1945, but he stayed under military rule until civilian governance was reinstated in July 1946. As the British attempted to establish greater control over the area, the Sultan struggled to reclaim total authority in the post-war era due to persistent conflicts over administrative oversight and governance with the British Military Administration.

=== Struggle for Independence ===

Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin was portrayed by British envoy Malcolm MacDonald in July 1946 as a weak and indulgent king who was driven by excess and a lack of dedication to his royal duties. In Brunei Town, a welcome arch was built during MacDonald&#x27;s visit, bearing the words &quot;Restorer of Peace and Justice&quot; beneath the Union Jack, emphasising the rights of the Sultan and his subjects. The Sultan backed local emotions despite British instructions to change the words on the arch, a reflection of his complex relationship with colonial authority.

Because MacDonald&#x27;s proposal to maintain Brunei&#x27;s independence from Sarawak and North Borneo was supported by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Sultan was able to consolidate his control following World War II. Sultan said that Brunei ought to have profited from any changes in territory, and he was unhappy with the British Crown&#x27;s handling of Sarawak. As a demonstration of his support for the political movement, Brunei developed its national song, &quot;Allah Peliharakan Sultan,&quot; and adopted the &quot;Barisan Pemuda&quot;&#x27;s (BARIP) flag. In an effort to improve relations, Resident Eric Pretty was reappointed in August 1948 as tensions between the Sultan and British authorities increased. He recommended that the Sultan write to the Secretary of State, highlighting Brunei&#x27;s challenges and proposing the building of a new palace in place of the one that had been destroyed during the war.

In 1950, Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin became increasingly political, frustrated by the British government&#x27;s refusal to return his palace despite higher oil revenues. He sought to renegotiate Brunei&#x27;s constitutional relationship with the Britain and pushed for increased oil royalties from British Malayan Petroleum. Planning a trip to London with his advisor MacBryan, the Sultan also expressed dissatisfaction with Brunei&#x27;s oilfield concessions and Sarawak&#x27;s cession. As Political Secretary, MacBryan advocated for including Muslims from northern Borneo and the southern Philippines in Brunei&#x27;s post-war administration, a move that raised concerns for the British Colonial Office regarding its potential impact on Brunei&#x27;s oil output and sovereignty. The Sultan&#x27;s initiatives aimed to address economic challenges and enhance Brunei&#x27;s standing in negotiations with Britain.

After ascending to the throne, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III became the leader of the Islamic faith in Brunei, with a primary goal of improving the educational system. In 1950, Brunei began sending students to the Al-Juned Arabic School in Singapore, and by 1963, the first Bruneian graduated from Al-Azhar University in Egypt, marking a significant advancement in regional Islamic education. The Sultan&#x27;s administration allocated B$10.65 million to education in 1954, which funded the construction of 30 schools and the provision of free meals for students. To accommodate the growing student population, notable secondary schools like Sultan Muhammad Jamalul Alam Secondary School and Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien College were built. Additionally, the Department of Religious Affairs was established in 1954 to oversee Brunei&#x27;s Islamic constitutional matters, leading to the opening of seven religious schools by 1956 and greatly enhancing Islamic education in the country.

Brunei&#x27;s oil sector grew rapidly beginning in 1950, with the country&#x27;s first oil platform built in Seria in 1952. A $14 million gas pipeline was installed in 1955, and by 1956, the Seria field was producing 114,700 barrels of oil per day. Since its founding in 1957, the Brunei Shell Petroleum firm has produced a substantial amount of crude oil and natural gasoline, totaling 705,000 tons and 39.5 million tons, respectively. The 1st National Development Plan, initiated in 1953, prioritised public health and infrastructure, with a B$100 million budget allocated for building Muara Port and developing transportation, telecommunication, energy, and water supply. This initiative also significantly reduced the number of malaria cases while improving public health through the provision of clean water and enhanced sanitation. By 1958, B$4 million had been spent on education, and Brunei Airport was renovated in 1954, which greatly increased communication and transit.

In early 1959, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III led a delegation to London to finalise Brunei&#x27;s Constitution after the Merdeka Talks. Between 23 March and 6 April 1959, negotiations with British officials addressed key constitutional issues, including council meetings, elections, and the role of the Menteri Besar. An agreement was reached on 6 April 1959, leading to the phased implementation of the Constitution. On 29 September 1959, the Sultan signed and proclaimed Brunei&#x27;s first written Constitution, which ended British control dating back to the 1888 and 1905–06 treaties and restored Brunei&#x27;s sovereignty over its internal affairs.

=== Post-independence and beyond ===

Brunei gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984, joining ASEAN in the same year. Economic growth from its extensive petroleum and natural gas fields during the 1990s and 2000s, with the GDP increasing 56% from 1999 to 2008, transformed Brunei into an industrialised country. Brunei has the second-highest Human Development Index among the Southeast Asian nations, after Singapore, and is classified as a &quot;developed country&quot;. In 2014, the Sultan instituted an Islamic Sharia penal code.

The earliest evidence of hominid occupation discovered in what is today Bulgaria date from at least 1.4 million years ago. Around 5000 BC, a sophisticated civilization already existed which produced some of the first pottery, jewellery and golden artifacts in the world. After 3500 BC, the Thracians appeared on the Balkan Peninsula. In the late 6th century BC, parts of what is currently Bulgaria, in particular the eastern region of the country, came under the Persian Achaemenid Empire. In the 470s BC, the Thracians formed the powerful Odrysian Kingdom which lasted until 46 BC, when it was finally conquered by the Roman Empire. During the centuries, some Thracian tribes fell under ancient Macedonian and Hellenistic, and also Celtic domination. This mixture of ancient peoples was assimilated by the Slavs, who permanently settled on the peninsula after 500 AD.

In 632 the Bulgars formed an independent state north of the Black sea that became known as Great Bulgaria under the leadership of Kubrat. Pressure from the Khazars led to the gradual disintegration of Great Bulgaria in the second half of the 7th century. One of Kubrat&#x27;s successors, Asparuh, leading some of the Bulgar tribes settled in the area around the Danube delta, and subsequently conquered Scythia Minor and Moesia Inferior from the Byzantine Empire, expanding his new kingdom further into the Balkan peninsula. The crucial Battle of Ongal in 680, the peace treaty with Byzantium in 681, and the establishment of a permanent Bulgarian capital at Pliska south of the Danube mark the beginning of the First Bulgarian Empire. The new state brought together local Byzantine population and migrant population as Early Slavs under Bulgar rule, and a slow process of mutual assimilation began. In the following centuries Bulgaria established itself as a powerful empire, dominating the Balkans through its aggressive military traditions, which led to development of a distinct ethnic identity. Its ethnically and culturally diverse people united under a common religion, language and alphabet which formed and preserved the Bulgarian national consciousness despite foreign invasions and influences.

In the 11th century, the First Bulgarian Empire collapsed under multiple Rus&#x27; and Byzantine attacks and wars, and was conquered and became part of the Byzantine Empire until 1185. Then, a major uprising led by two brothers, Asen and Peter of the Asen dynasty, restored the Bulgarian state to form the Second Bulgarian Empire. After reaching its apogee in the 1230s, Bulgaria started to decline due to a number of factors, most notably its geographic position which rendered it vulnerable to simultaneous attacks and invasions from many sides. A peasant rebellion, one of the few successful such in history, established the swineherd Ivaylo as a Tsar. His short reign was essential in recovering—at least partially—the integrity of the Bulgarian state. A relatively thriving period followed after 1300, but ended in 1371, when factional divisions caused Bulgaria to split into three small Tsardoms. By 1396, they were subjugated by the Ottoman Empire. The Turks eliminated the Bulgarian system of nobility and ruling clergy, and Bulgaria remained an integral Ottoman Empire territory for the next 500 years.

With the decline of the Ottoman Empire after 1700, signs of revival started to emerge. The Bulgarian nobility had vanished, leaving an egalitarian peasant society with a small but growing urban middle class. By the 19th century, the Bulgarian National Revival became a key component of the struggle for independence, which would culminate in the failed April uprising in 1876, which prompted the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 and the subsequent Liberation of Bulgaria. The initial Treaty of San Stefano was rejected by the Great Powers, and the following Treaty of Berlin limited Bulgaria&#x27;s territories to Moesia and the region of Sofia. This left many ethnic Bulgarians out of the borders of the new state, which defined Bulgaria&#x27;s militaristic approach to regional affairs and its allegiance to Germany in both World Wars.

After World War II, Bulgaria became a Communist state, and the General Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Todor Zhivkov, served for a period of 35 years, where there was relatively rapid economic growth. The Communist system collapsed in the 1980s, and several problems in the 1990s decreased the economic development of Bulgaria&#x27;s agricultural and other industries. A period of relative stabilization began with the election of Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha as prime minister in 2001. Bulgaria joined NATO in 2004 and the European Union in 2007.

==Prehistory==


The earliest human remains found in Bulgaria were excavated in the Kozarnika cave, with an approximate age of 1,6 million BC. This cave probably keeps the earliest evidence of human symbolic behaviour ever found. A fragmented pair of human jaws, which are 44,000 years old, were found in Bacho Kiro cave, but it is disputed whether these early humans were in fact Homo sapiens or Neanderthals.

The earliest dwellings in Bulgaria – the Stara Zagora Neolithic dwellings – date from 6,000 BC and are amongst the oldest human-made structures yet discovered. By the end of the neolithic, the Karanovo, Hamangia and Vinča cultures developed on what is today Bulgaria, southern Romania and eastern Serbia. The earliest known town in Europe, Solnitsata, was located in present-day Bulgaria. The Durankulak lake settlement in Bulgaria commenced on a small island, approximately 7000 BC and around 4700/4600 BC the stone architecture was already in general use and became a characteristic phenomenon that was unique in Europe.

The eneolithic Varna culture (5000 BC) represents the first civilization with a sophisticated social hierarchy in Europe. The centrepiece of this culture is the Varna Necropolis, discovered in the early 1970s. It serves as a tool in understanding how the earliest European societies functioned, principally through well-preserved ritual burials, pottery, and golden jewellery. The golden rings, bracelets and ceremonial weapons discovered in one of the graves were created between 4,600 and 4200 BC, which makes them the oldest gold artefacts yet discovered anywhere in the world.

Some of the earliest evidence of grape cultivation and livestock domestication is associated with the Bronze Age Ezero culture. The Magura Cave drawings date from the same era, although the exact years of their creation cannot be pin-pointed.

==Antiquity==
===The Thracians===


The first people to leave lasting traces and cultural heritage throughout the region were the Thracians. Their origin remains obscure. It is generally proposed that a proto-Thracian people developed from a mixture of indigenous peoples and Indo-Europeans from the time of Proto-Indo-European expansion in the Early Bronze Age when the latter, around 1500 BC, conquered the indigenous peoples. Thracian craftsmen inherited the skills of the indigenous civilisations before them, especially in gold working.

The Thracians were generally disorganized, but had an advanced culture despite the lack of their own proper script, and gathered powerful military forces when their divided tribes formed unions under the pressure of external threats. They formed the Odrysian kingdom Although the concept of an urban center was not developed until the Roman period, various larger fortifications which also served as regional market centers were numerous. Yet, in general, despite Greek colonization in such areas as Byzantium, Apollonia and other cities, the Thracians avoided urban life.

The first Greek colonies in Thrace were founded in the 8th century BC.

====Achaemenid Persian invasions====


Ever since the Macedonian king Amyntas I surrendered his country to the Persians in about 512-511 BC, Macedonians and Persians were strangers no more. Subjugation of Macedonia was part of Persian military operations initiated by Darius the Great (521–486 BC). In 513 BC - after immense preparations - a huge Achaemenid army invaded the Balkans and tried to defeat the European Scythians roaming to the north of the Danube river. Darius&#x27; army subjugated several Thracian peoples, and virtually all other regions that touch the European part of the Black Sea, such as parts of nowadays Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, and Russia, before it returned to Asia Minor. Darius left in Europe one of his commanders named Megabazus whose task was to accomplish conquests in the Balkans. The Persian troops subjugated gold-rich Thrace, the coastal Greek cities, as well as defeating and conquering the powerful Paeonians. Finally, Megabazus sent envoys to Amyntas, demanding acceptation of Persian domination, which the Macedonians accepted. Following the Ionian Revolt, the Persian hold over the Balkans loosened, but was firmly restored in 492 BC through the campaigns of Mardonius. The Balkans, including what is nowadays Bulgaria, provided many soldiers for the multi-ethnic Achaemenid army. Several Thracian treasures dating from the Persian rule in Bulgaria have been found. Most of what is today eastern Bulgaria remained firmly under the Persian sway until 479 BC. The Persian garrison at Doriscus in Thrace held out for many years even after the Persian defeat, and reportedly never surrendered. It remained as the last Persian stronghold in Europe.

===Thracian Odrysian kingdom (c. 480 BC - 30 BC)===


Thracian tribes remained divided and most of them fell under nominal Persian rule from the late 6th century until the first half of the 5th century, until King Teres united most of them under the Odrysian kingdom around 470 BC, probably after the Persian defeat in Greece which later peaked under the leadership of King Sitalces (431–424 BC) and of Cotys I (383–359 BC). This Thracian kingdom thrived between the early 5th century BC and the early 3rd / late 1st century BC. Located in present-day Bulgaria, southeastern Romania (northern Dobruja), northeastern Greece and European Turkey, it was a tribal amalgam dominated by the Odrysians that was the first large political entity to develop in the eastern Balkans. Before the foundation of Seuthopolis in the late 4th century it had no fixed capital. Similar to the Gauls and other Celtic tribes, most Thracians are thought to have lived simply in small fortified villages, usually on hilltops. At the commencement of the Peloponnesian war, Sitalces entered into alliance with the Athenians, and in 429 BC he invaded Macedon (then ruled by Perdiccas II) with a vast army that included 150,000 warriors from independent Thracian tribes. Cotys I on the other hand, went to war with the Athenians for the possession of the Thracian Chersonese.

====Ancient Macedon invasions====


Thereafter the Macedonian Empire incorporated the Odrysian kingdom and Thracians became an inalienable component in the extra-continental expeditions of both Philip II and Alexander III (the Great).

====Ancient Celtic invasions====
In 298 BC, Celtic tribes reached what is today Bulgaria and clashed with the forces of Macedonian king Cassander on Mount Haemos (Stara Planina). The Macedonians won the battle, but that did not stop the Celtic advancement. Many Thracian communities, weakened by the Macedonian occupation, fell under Celtic dominance.

In 279 BC, one of the Celtic armies, led by Comontorius, attacked Thrace and succeeded in conquering it. Comontorius established the kingdom of Tylis in what is now eastern Bulgaria. The modern-day village of Tulovo bears the name of the relatively short-lived kingdom. Cultural interactions between Thracians and Celts are evidenced by several items containing elements of both cultures, such as the chariot of Mezek and almost certainly the Gundestrup cauldron.

Tylis lasted until 212 BC, when the Thracians managed to regain their dominant position in the region and disbanded it. Small bands of Celts survived in Western Bulgaria. One such tribe were the &quot;serdi&quot;, from which &quot;Serdica&quot; - the ancient name of Sofia - originates. Even though the Celts remained in the Balkans for more than a century, their influence on the peninsula was modest. By the end of the 3rd century, a new threat appeared for the people of the Thracian region in the shape of the Roman Empire.

===Roman period===

In 188 BC, the Romans invaded Thrace, and warfare continued until 46 AD when Rome finally conquered the region.

==== Sapaean Thracian kingdom (Roman vassal state) (1st century BC - 46 AD) ====

The Sapaean kingdom was an ancient Thracian state in the southeastern Balkans that existed from the middle of the 1st century BC until 46 AD. Succeeding the Classical and Hellenistic era Odrysian kingdom of Thrace, it was dominated by the Sapaean tribe, who ruled from their capital Bizye in what is now northwestern Turkey. Initially only of limited relevance, its power grew significantly in the ancient Roman world as a client state of the late Roman Republic. After the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, Octavian (later emperor Augustus) installed a new dynasty that proved to be highly loyal and expansive. Conquering and ruling much of Thrace on behalf of the Roman Empire, it lasted until 46 AD, when Emperor Claudius annexed the kingdom and made Thracia into a Roman province.

==== Roman rule ====

In 46 AD, the Romans established the province of Thracia. By the 4th century, the Thracians had a composite indigenous identity, as Christian &quot;Romans&quot; who preserved some of their ancient pagan rituals. Thraco-Romans became a dominant group in the region, and eventually yielded several military commanders and emperors such as Galerius and Constantine I the Great. Urban centres became well-developed, especially the territories of Serdika, which today the city of Sofia, due to the abundance of mineral springs. The influx of immigrants from around the empire enriched the local cultural landscape; temples of Osiris and Isis have been discovered near the Black Sea coast. Sometime before 300 AD, Diocletian further divided Thracia into four smaller provinces.

== Migration Period (3rd century - 7th century)==


In the 4th century, a group of Goths arrived in northern Bulgaria and settled in and around Nicopolis ad Istrum. There the Gothic bishop Ulfilas translated the Bible from Greek to Gothic, creating the Gothic alphabet in the process. This was the first book written in a Germanic language, and for this reason at least one historian refers to Ulfilas as &quot;the father of Germanic literature&quot;. The first Christian monastery in Europe was founded in 344 by Saint Athanasius near modern-day Chirpan following the Council of Serdica.

Due to the rural nature of the local population, Roman control of the region remained weak. In the 5th century, Attila&#x27;s Huns attacked the territories of today&#x27;s Bulgaria and pillaged many Roman settlements. By the end of the 6th century, Avars organized regular incursions into northern Bulgaria, which were a prelude to the &quot;en masse&quot; arrival of the Slavs.

During the 6th century, the traditional Greco-Roman culture was still influential, but Christian philosophy and culture were dominant and began to replace it. From the 7th century, Greek became the predominant language under the Eastern Roman Empire&#x27;s administration, Church and society, replacing Latin.
===Slavs===

The Slavs emerged from their original homeland (most commonly thought to have been in Eastern Europe) in the early 6th century and spread to most of eastern Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Balkans, thus forming three main branches - the West Slavs, the East Slavs and the South Slavs. The easternmost South Slavs settled on the territory of modern Bulgaria during the 6th century.

Most of the Thracians were eventually Hellenized or Romanized, with some exceptions surviving in remote areas until the 5th century. A portion of the eastern South Slavs assimilated most of them, before the Bulgar élite incorporated these peoples into the First Bulgarian Empire.

===Bulgars===
The Bulgars were a semi-nomadic people of Turkic descent, originally from Central Asia, who from the 2nd century onwards dwelled in the steppes north of the Caucasus and around the banks of river Volga (then Itil). A branch of them gave rise to the First Bulgarian Empire. The Bulgars were governed by hereditary khans. There were several aristocratic families whose members, bearing military titles, formed a governing class. Bulgars were polytheistic, but chiefly worshiped the supreme deity Tangra.

===Old Great Bulgaria===
Unified under a single ruler, Kurt, or Kubrat (reigned c. 605–c. 642), the Bulgars constituted a powerful polity known to the Eastern Romans as Great Bulgaria. This country was situated between the lower course of the Danube river to the west, the Black Sea and the Azov Sea to the south, the Kuban river to the east and the Donets river to the north. The capital was Phanagoria, on the Azov.

In 635, Kubrat signed a peace treaty with emperor Heraclius of the Byzantine Empire, expanding the Bulgar kingdom further into the Balkans. Later, Kubrat was crowned with the title Patrician by Heraclius. The kingdom never survived Kubrat&#x27;s death. After several wars with the Khazars, the Bulgars were finally defeated and they migrated to the south, to the north, and mainly to the west into the Balkans, where most of the other Bulgar tribes were living, in a state vassal to the Byzantine Empire since the 5th century.

One of the successors of Khan Kubrat, Kotrag led nine Bulgar tribes to the north along the banks of the river Volga in what is today Russia, creating the Kingdom of the Volga Bulgars in the late 7th century. This kingdom later became the trade and cultural centre of the north, because it stood on a very strategic position creating a monopoly over the trade among the Arabs, the Norse and the Avars. The Volga Bulgars were the first to ever defeat the Mongolic horde and protected Europe for decades, but after countless Mongol invasions the Kingdom of the Volga Bulgars was destroyed and most of its citizens slaughtered or sold as slaves in Asia.

Another successor of Khan Kubrat, Asparuh (Kotrag&#x27;s brother) moved west, occupying today&#x27;s southern Bessarabia. After a successful war with Byzantium in 680, Asparuh&#x27;s khanate conquered initially Scythia Minor and was recognised as an independent state under the subsequent treaty signed with the Byzantine Empire in 681. That year is usually regarded as the year of the establishment of present-day Bulgaria and Asparuh is regarded as the first Bulgarian ruler.

Another Bulgar horde, led by Asparuh&#x27;s brother Kuber, came to settle in Pannonia and later into the region of Macedonia.

==First Bulgarian Empire (681–1018)==


Under the reign of Asparuh Bulgaria expanded southwest after the Battle of Ongal and Danubian Bulgaria was created.

During the Late Roman Empire, several Roman provinces covered the territory that comprises present-day Bulgaria: Scythia (Scythia Minor), Moesia (Upper and Lower), Thrace, Macedonia (First and Second), Dacia (Coastal and Inner, both south of Danube), Dardania, Rhodope and Haemismontus, and had a mixed population of Byzantine Greeks, Thracians and Dacians, most of whom spoke either Greek or variants of Vulgar Latin. Several consecutive waves of Slavic migration throughout the 6th and the early 7th centuries led to a dramatic change of the demographics of the region and its almost complete Slavicisation.
The son and heir of Asparuh, Tervel, became ruler in the beginning of 8th century when the Byzantine emperor Justinian II asked Tervel for assistance in recovering his throne, for which Tervel received the region Zagore from the Empire and was paid large quantities of gold. He also received the Byzantine title &quot;Caesar&quot;. Years later, the emperor decided to betray and attack Bulgaria, but his army was crushed in the battle of Anhialo. After the death of Justinian II, the Bulgarians continued their crusades against the empire and in 716 they reached Constantinople. The threat of both the Bulgarians and the Arab menace in the east, forced the new emperor Theodosius III, to sign a peace treaty with Tervel. The successor, Leo III the Isaurian had to deal with an army of 100,000 Arabs led by Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik and a fleet of 2,500 ships that were laying siege on Constantinople in the year 717. Relying on his treaty with Bulgaria, the emperor asked Khan Tervel to help him deal with the Arab invasion. Tervel accepted and the Arabs were decimated outside the walls of the city. The fleet was heavily damaged with the help of Greek fire. The remaining ships were destroyed by a storm, in an attempt to flee. So the Second Arab Siege of Constantinople ended. After the reign of Tervel, there were frequent changes in the ruling houses, which lead to instability and political crisis.

Decades later, in 768, Telerig of the house Dulo, ruled Bulgaria. His military campaign against Constantine V in the year 774, proved to be unsuccessful. Thrilled with his success against Telerig, the Byzantine Emperor dispatched a fleet 2,000 ships loaded with horsemen. This expedition proved to be a failure, because of strong northern winds near Mesembria. Telerig was aware of the increased presence of spies in the capital Pliska. To decrease this Byzantine influence, he sent a letter to the emperor in which he asks for refuge in Constantinople and wants to know which Byzantine spies can help him. Knowing their names, he slaughters every agent in the capital. His rule marked the end of the political crisis.

Under the reign of Krum (802–814) Bulgaria expanded vastly north-west and south, occupying the lands between the middle Danube and Moldova rivers, all of present-day Romania, Sofia in 809 and Adrianople in 813, and threatening Constantinople itself. Krum implemented law reform intending to reduce poverty and strengthen social ties in his vastly enlarged state.

During the reign of Khan Omurtag (814–831), the northwestern boundaries with the Frankish Empire were firmly settled along the middle Danube. A magnificent palace, pagan temples, ruler&#x27;s residence, fortress, citadel, water mains and baths were built in the Bulgarian capital Pliska, mainly of stone and brick.

Omurtag pursued policy of repression against Christians. Menologion of Basil II, glorifies Emperor Basil II showing him as a warrior defending Orthodox Christendom against the attacks of the Bulgarian Empire, whose attacks on Christians are graphically illustrated.
===Christianization===
Under Boris I, Bulgaria became officially Christian, and the Ecumenical Patriarch agreed to allow an autonomous Bulgarian Archbishop at Pliska. Missionaries from Constantinople, Cyril and Methodius, devised the Glagolitic alphabet, which was adopted in the Bulgarian Empire around 886. The alphabet and the Old Bulgarian language that evolved from Slavonic gave rise to a rich literary and cultural activity centered around the Preslav and Ohrid Literary Schools, established by order of Boris I in 886.
In the early 9th century, a new alphabet — Cyrillic — was developed at the Preslav Literary School, adapted from the Glagolitic alphabet invented by Saints Cyril and Methodius. An alternative theory is that the alphabet was devised at the Ohrid Literary School by Saint Climent of Ohrid, a Bulgarian scholar and disciple of Cyril and Methodius.

By the late 9th and early 10th centuries, Bulgaria extended to Epirus and Thessaly in the south, Bosnia in the west and controlled all of present-day Romania and eastern Hungary to the north reuniting with old roots. A Serbian state came into existence as a dependency of the Bulgarian Empire. Under Tsar Simeon I of Bulgaria (Simeon the Great), who was educated in Constantinople, Bulgaria became again a serious threat to the Byzantine Empire. His aggressive policy was aimed at displacing Byzantium as major partner of the nomadic polities in the area. By subverting the principles of Byzantine diplomacy and political culture, Simeon turned his own kingdom into a society-structuring factor in the nomadic world.

Simeon hoped to take Constantinople and become emperor of both Bulgarians and Greeks, and fought a series of wars with the Byzantines through his long reign (893–927). At the end of his rule the front had reached the Peloponnese in the south, making it the most powerful state in contemporary Southeast Europe. Simeon proclaimed himself &quot;Tsar (Caesar) of the Bulgarians and the Romans&quot;, a title which was recognised by the Pope, but not by the Byzantine Emperor. The capital Preslav was said to rival Constantinople, the new independent Bulgarian Orthodox Church became the first new patriarchate besides the Pentarchy and Bulgarian translations of Christian texts spread all over the Slavic world of the time.

=== Bogomilism ===
During the reign of Emperor PeterI (r.927–969) a heretical movement known as Bogomilism arose in Bulgaria. The heresy was named after its founder the priest Bogomil whose name can be translated as dear (&quot;mil&quot;) to God (&quot;Bog&quot;). The main sources about Bogomilism in Bulgaria come from a letter of the Ecumenical Patriarch Theophylact of Constantinople to Peter I (c.940), a treatise by Cosmas the Priest (c.970) and the anti-Bogomil council of Emperor Boril of Bulgaria (1211). Bogomilism was a neo-Gnostic and dualist sect that believed that God had two sons, Jesus Christ and Satan, that represented the two principles good and evil. God had created light and the invisible world, while Satan rebelled and created darkness, the material world and man.

===Decline=== 
After Simeon&#x27;s death, Bulgaria was weakened by external and internal wars with Croatians, Magyars, Pechenegs and Serbs and the spread of the Bogomil heresy. Two consecutive Rus&#x27; and Byzantine invasions resulted in the seizure of the capital Preslav by the Byzantine army in 971. Under Samuil, Bulgaria somewhat recovered from these attacks and managed to conquer Serbia and Duklja.

In 986, the Byzantine emperor Basil II undertook a campaign to conquer Bulgaria. After a war lasting several decades he inflicted a decisive defeat upon the Bulgarians in 1014 and completed the campaign four years later. In 1018, after the death of the last Bulgarian Tsar - Ivan Vladislav, most of Bulgaria&#x27;s nobility chose to join the Eastern Roman Empire. However, Bulgaria lost its independence and remained subject to Byzantium for more than a century and a half. With the collapse of the state, the Bulgarian church fell under the domination of Byzantine ecclesiastics who took control of the Ohrid Archbishopric.

==Bulgaria under Byzantine rule (1018–1185)==
No evidence remains of major resistance or any uprising of the Bulgarian population or nobility in the first decade after the establishment of Byzantine rule. Given the existence of such irreconcilable opponents to the Byzantines as Krakra, Nikulitsa, Dragash and others, such apparent passivity seems difficult to explain. Some historians
explain this as a consequence of the concessions that Basil II granted the Bulgarian nobility to gain their allegiance.

Basil II guaranteed the indivisibility of Bulgaria in its former geographic borders and did not officially abolish the local rule of the Bulgarian nobility, who became part of Byzantine aristocracy as archons or strategoi. Secondly, special charters (royal decrees) of Basil II recognised the autocephaly of the Bulgarian Archbishopric of Ohrid and set up its boundaries, securing the continuation of the dioceses already existing under Samuil, their property and other privileges.

After the death of Basil II the empire entered into a period of instability. In 1040, Peter Delyan organized a large-scale rebellion, but failed to restore the Bulgarian state and was killed. Shortly after, the Komnenos dynasty came into succession and halted the decline of the empire. During this time the Byzantine state experienced a century of stability and progress.

In 1180 the last of the capable Komnenoi, Manuel I Komnenos, died and was replaced by the relatively incompetent Angeloi dynasty, allowing some Bulgarian nobles to organize an uprising. In 1185 Peter and Asen, leading nobles of supposed and contested Bulgarian, Cuman, Vlach or mixed origin, led a revolt against Byzantine rule and Peter declared himself Tsar Peter II. The following year, the Byzantines were forced to recognize Bulgaria&#x27;s independence. Peter styled himself &quot;Tsar of the Bulgars, Greeks and Wallachians&quot;.

==Second Bulgarian Empire (1185–1396)==


Resurrected Bulgaria occupied the territory between the Black Sea, the Danube and Stara Planina, including a part of eastern Macedonia, Belgrade and the valley of the Morava. It also exercised control over Wallachia Tsar Kaloyan (1197–1207) entered a union with the Papacy, thereby securing the recognition of his title of &quot;Rex&quot; (King) although he desired to be recognized as &quot;Emperor&quot; or &quot;Tsar&quot; of Bulgarians and Vlachs. He waged wars on the Byzantine Empire and (after 1204) on the Knights of the Fourth Crusade, conquering large parts of Thrace, the Rhodopes, Bohemia, and Moldavia as well as the whole of Macedonia.

In the Battle of Adrianople in 1205, Kaloyan defeated the forces of the Latin Empire and thus limited its power from the very first year of its establishment. The power of the Hungarians and to some extent the Serbs prevented significant expansion to the west and north-west. Under Ivan Asen II (1218–1241), Bulgaria once again became a regional power, occupying Belgrade and Albania. In an inscription from Turnovo in 1230 he entitled himself &quot;In Christ the Lord faithful Tsar and autocrat of the Bulgarians, son of the old Asen&quot;.

The Bulgarian Orthodox Patriarchate was restored in 1235 with approval of all eastern Patriarchates, thus putting an end to the union with the Papacy. Ivan Asen II had a reputation as a wise and humane ruler, and opened relations with the Catholic west, especially Venice and Genoa, to reduce the influence of the Byzantines over his country. Tarnovo became a major economic and religious centre—a &quot;Third Rome&quot;, unlike the already declining Constantinople. As Simeon the Great during the first empire, Ivan Asen II expanded the territory to the coasts of three seas (Adriatic, Aegean and Black), annexed Medea - the last fortress before the walls of Constantinople, unsuccessfully besieged the city in 1235 and restored the destroyed since 1018 Bulgarian Patriarchate.

The country&#x27;s military and economic might declined after the end of the Asen dynasty in 1257, facing internal conflicts, constant Byzantine and Hungarian attacks and Mongol domination. Tsar Teodore Svetoslav (reigned 1300–1322) restored Bulgarian prestige from 1300 onwards, but only temporarily. Political instability continued to grow, and Bulgaria gradually began to lose territory. This led to a peasant rebellion led by the swineherd Ivaylo, who eventually managed to defeat the Tsar&#x27;s forces and ascend the throne.

===Ottoman incursions===

A weakened 14th-century Bulgaria faced a new threat from the south, the Ottoman Turks, who crossed into Europe in 1354. By 1371, factional divisions between the feudal landlords and the spread of Bogomilism had caused the Second Bulgarian Empire to split into three small tsardoms—Vidin, Tarnovo and Karvuna—and several semi-independent principalities that fought among themselves, and also with Byzantines, Hungarians, Serbs, Venetians and Genoese.

The Ottomans faced little resistance from these divided and weak Bulgarian states. In 1362 they captured Philippopolis (Plovdiv), and in 1382 they took Sofia. The Ottomans then turned their attentions to the Serbs, whom they routed at Kosovo Polje in 1389. In 1393 the Ottomans occupied Tarnovo after a three-month siege. In 1396 the Tsardom of Vidin was also invaded, bringing the Second Bulgarian Empire and Bulgarian independence to an end.

==Bulgaria under Ottoman rule (1396–1878)==
In 1393, the Ottomans captured Tarnovo, the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire, after a three-month siege. In 1396, the Vidin Tsardom fell after the defeat of a Christian crusade at the Battle of Nicopolis. With this the Ottomans finally subjugated and occupied Bulgaria.

A Polish-Hungarian crusade commanded by Władysław III of Poland set out to free Bulgaria and the Balkans in 1444, but the Turks emerged victorious at the battle of Varna.
The new authorities dismantled Bulgarian institutions and merged the separate Bulgarian Church into the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople (although a small, autocephalous Bulgarian archbishopric of Ohrid survived until January 1767). Turkish authorities destroyed most of the medieval Bulgarian fortresses to prevent rebellions. Large towns and the areas where Ottoman power predominated remained severely depopulated until the 19th century.

The Ottomans did not normally require the Christians to become Muslims. Nevertheless, there were many cases of forced individual or mass Islamization, especially in the Rhodopes. Bulgarians who converted to Islam, the Pomaks, retained Bulgarian language, dress and some customs compatible with Islam..

The Ottoman system began declining by the 17th century and at the end of the 18th had all but collapsed. Central government weakened over the decades and this had allowed a number of local Ottoman holders of large estates to establish personal ascendancy over separate regions. During the last two decades of the 18th and first decades of the 19th centuries the Balkan Peninsula dissolved into virtual anarchy.

Bulgarian tradition calls this period the &quot;kurdjaliistvo&quot;: armed bands of Turks called &quot;kurdjalii&quot; plagued the area. In many regions, thousands of peasants fled from the countryside either to local towns or (more commonly) to the hills or forests; some even fled beyond the Danube to Moldova, Wallachia or southern Russia. The decline of Ottoman authorities also allowed a gradual revival of Bulgarian culture, which became a key component in the ideology of national liberation.
Conditions gradually improved in certain areas in the 19th century. Some towns — such as Gabrovo, Tryavna, Karlovo, Koprivshtitsa, Lovech, Skopie — prospered. The Bulgarian peasants actually possessed their land, although it officially belonged to the sultan. The 19th century also brought improved communications, transportation and trade. The first factory in the Bulgarian lands opened in Sliven in 1834 and the first railway system started running (between Rousse and Varna) in 1865.

Bulgarian nationalism was emergent in the early 19th century under the influence of western ideas such as liberalism and nationalism, which trickled into the country after the French Revolution, mostly via Greece. The Greek revolt against the Ottomans which began in 1821 also influenced the small Bulgarian educated class. But Greek influence was limited by the general Bulgarian resentment of Greek control of the Bulgarian Church and it was the struggle to revive an independent Bulgarian Church which first roused Bulgarian nationalist sentiment.

In 1870, a Bulgarian Exarchate was created by a firman and the first Bulgarian Exarch, Antim I, became the natural leader of the emerging nation. The Constantinople Patriarch reacted by excommunicating the Bulgarian Exarchate, which reinforced their will for independence. A struggle for political liberation from the Ottoman Empire emerged in the face of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee and the Internal Revolutionary Organisation led by liberal revolutionaries such as Vasil Levski, Hristo Botev and Lyuben Karavelov.

===April Uprising and Russo-Turkish War (1870s)===


In April 1876, the Bulgarians revolted in the April Uprising. The revolt was poorly organized and started before the planned date. It was largely confined to the region of Plovdiv, though certain districts in northern Bulgaria, in Macedonia, and in the area of Sliven also took part. The uprising was crushed by the Ottomans, who brought in irregular troops (bashi-bazouks) from outside the area. Countless villages were pillaged and tens of thousands of people were massacred, the majority of them in the insurgent towns of Batak, Perushtitsa, and Bratsigovo, all in the area of Plovdiv.
The massacres aroused a broad public reaction among liberal Europeans such as William Ewart Gladstone, who launched a campaign against the &quot;Bulgarian Horrors&quot;. The campaign was supported by many European intellectuals and public figures. The strongest reaction, however, came from Russia. The enormous public outcry which the April Uprising had caused in Europe led to the Constantinople Conference of the Great Powers in 1876–77.

Turkey&#x27;s refusal to implement the decisions of the conference gave Russia a long-waited chance to realise her long-term objectives with regard to the Ottoman Empire. Having its reputation at stake, Russia declared war on the Ottomans in April 1877. The Bulgarians also fought alongside the advancing Russians. Russia established a provisional government in Bulgaria. The Russian army and the Bulgarian Opalchentsi decisively defeated the Ottomans at Shipka Pass and Pleven. By January 1878 they had liberated much of the Bulgarian lands. (See Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878).)

==Third Bulgarian State (1878–1946)==
The Treaty of San Stefano was signed on 3 March 1878 and set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire, including the regions of Moesia, Thrace and Macedonia, though the state was &quot;de jure&quot; only autonomous but &quot;de facto&quot; functioned independently. However, trying to preserve the balance of power in Europe and fearing the establishment of a large Russian client state in the Balkans, the other Great Powers were reluctant to agree to the treaty.

As a result, the Treaty of Berlin (1878), under the supervision of Otto von Bismarck of Germany and Benjamin Disraeli of Britain, revised the earlier treaty, and scaled back the proposed Bulgarian state. The new territory of Bulgaria was limited between the Danube and the Stara Planina range, with its seat at the old Bulgarian capital of Veliko Turnovo and including Sofia. This revision left large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country and defined Bulgaria&#x27;s militaristic approach to foreign affairs and its participation in four wars during the first half of the 20th century.

Alexander of Battenberg, a German with close ties to the Russian Tsar, was the first prince (knyaz) of modern Bulgaria from 1879. Everyone had assumed Bulgaria would become a Russian ally. To the contrary, it became a bulwark against Russian expansion, and cooperated with the British. Bulgaria was attacked by Serbia in 1885, but defeated the invaders. It thereby gained respect from the great powers and defied Russia. In response Russia secured the abdication of Prince Alexander in 1886.

Stefan Stambolov (1854–1895) served 1886-1894 first as regent and then prime minister for the new ruler, Ferdinand I of Bulgaria (prince 1887–1908, tsar 1908–1918). Stambolov believed that Russia&#x27;s liberation of Bulgaria from Turkish rule had been an attempt by Czarist Russia to turn Bulgaria into its protectorate. His policy was characterized by the goal of preserving Bulgarian independence at all costs, working with both the Liberal majority and Conservative minority parties. During his leadership Bulgaria was transformed from an Ottoman province into a modern European state. Stambolov launched a new course in Bulgarian foreign policy, independent of the interests of any great power. His main foreign policy objective was the unification of the Bulgarian nation into a nation-state consisting of all the territories of the Bulgarian Exarchate granted by the Sultan in 1870. Stambolov established close connections with the Sultan in order to enliven Bulgarian national spirit in Macedonia and to oppose Russian-backed Greek and Serbian propaganda. As a result of Stambolov&#x27;s tactics, the Sultan recognised Bulgarians as the predominant people in Macedonia and gave a green light to the creation of a strong church and cultural institutions. Stambolov negotiated loans with western European countries to develop the economic and military strength of Bulgaria. In part, this was motivated by his desire to create a modern army which could secure all of the national territory. His approach toward western Europe was one of diplomatic manoeuvring. He understood the interests of the Austrian Empire in Macedonia and warned his diplomats accordingly. His domestic policy was distinguished by the defeat of terrorist groups sponsored by Russia, the strengthening of the rule of law, and rapid economic and educational growth, leading to progressive social and cultural change, and development of a modern army capable of protecting Bulgaria&#x27;s independence. Stambolov was aware that Bulgaria had to be politically, militarily, and economically strong to achieve national unification. He mapped out the political course which turned Bulgaria into a strong regional power, respected by the great powers of the day. However, Bulgaria&#x27;s regional leadership was short-lived. After Stambolov&#x27;s death the independent course of his policy was abandoned.

Bulgaria emerged from Turkish rule as a poor, underdeveloped agricultural country, with little industry or tapped natural resources. Most of the land was owned by small farmers, with peasants comprising 80% of the population of 3.8 million in 1900. Agrarianism was the dominant political philosophy in the countryside, as the peasantry organized a movement independent of any existing party. In 1899, the Bulgarian Agrarian Union was formed, bringing together rural intellectuals such as teachers with ambitious peasants. It promoted modern farming practices, as well as elementary education.

The government promoted modernization, with special emphasis on building a network of elementary and secondary schools. By 1910, there were 4,800 elementary schools, 330 lyceums, 27 post-secondary educational institutions, and 113 vocational schools. From 1878 to 1933, France funded numerous libraries, research institutes, and Catholic schools throughout Bulgaria. In 1888, a university was established. It was renamed the University of Sofia in 1904, where the three faculties of history and philology, physics and mathematics, and law produced civil servants for national and local government offices. It became the center of German and Russian intellectual, philosophical and theological influences.

The first decade of the century saw sustained prosperity, with steady urban growth. The capital of Sofia grew by a factor of 600% - from 20,000 population in 1878 to 120,000 in 1912, primarily from peasants who arrived from the villages to become laborers, 
tradesman and office seekers. Macedonians used Bulgaria as a base, beginning in 1894, to agitate for independence from the Ottoman Empire. They launched a poorly planned uprising in 1903 that was brutally suppressed, and led to tens of thousands of additional refugees pouring into Bulgaria.

===The Balkan Wars===
In the years following independence, Bulgaria became increasingly militarized and was often referred to as &quot;the Balkan Prussia&quot;, with regard to its desire to revise the Treaty of Berlin through warfare. The partition of territories in the Balkans by the Great Powers without regard to ethnic composition led to a wave of discontent not only in Bulgaria, but also in its neighbouring countries. In 1911, Nationalist Prime Minister Ivan Geshov formed an alliance with Greece and Serbia to jointly attack the Ottomans and revise the existing agreements around ethnic lines.

In February 1912 a secret treaty was signed between Bulgaria and Serbia and in May 1912 a similar agreement was sealed with Greece. Montenegro was also brought into the pact. The treaties provided for the partition of the regions of Macedonia and Thrace between the allies, although the lines of partition were left dangerously vague. After the Ottoman Empire refused to implement reforms in the disputed areas, the First Balkan War broke out in October 1912 at a time when the Ottomans were tied down in a major war with Italy in Libya. The allies easily defeated the Ottomans and seized most of its European territory.

Bulgaria sustained the heaviest casualties of any of the allies while also making the largest territorial claims. The Serbs in particular did not agree and refused to vacate any of the territory they had seized in northern Macedonia (that is, the territory roughly corresponding to the modern Republic of North Macedonia), saying that the Bulgarian army had failed to accomplish its pre-war goals at Adrianople (to capture it without Serbian help) and that the pre-war agreement on the division of Macedonia had to be revised. Some circles in Bulgaria inclined toward going to war with Serbia and Greece on this issue.

In June 1913, Serbia and Greece formed a new alliance against Bulgaria. The Serbian Prime Minister Nikola Pasic promised Greece Thrace to Greece [no reference] if it helped Serbia defend the territory it had captured in Macedonia; the Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos agreed [no reference]. Seeing this as a violation of the pre-war agreements, and privately encouraged by Germany and Austria-Hungary, Tsar Ferdinand declared war on Serbia and Greece on June 29.

The Serbian and Greek forces were initially beaten back from Bulgaria&#x27;s western border, but they quickly gained the advantage and forced Bulgaria to retreat. The fighting was very harsh, with many casualties, especially during the key Battle of Bregalnitsa. Soon afterward, the Romania entered the war on the side of Greece and Serbia, attacking Bulgaria from the north. The Ottoman Empire saw this as an opportunity to regain its lost territories and also attacked from the south-east.

Facing war on three different fronts, Bulgaria sued for peace. It was forced to relinquish most of its territorial acquisitions in Macedonia to Serbia and Greece, Adrianapole to the Ottoman Empire, and the region of Southern Dobruja to Romania. The two Balkan wars greatly destabilized Bulgaria, stopping its hitherto steady economic growth, and leaving 58,000 dead and over 100,000 wounded. The bitterness at the perceived betrayal of its former allies empowered political movements who demanded the restoration of Macedonia to Bulgaria.

===World War I===
In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars Bulgarian opinion turned against Russia and the Western powers, by whom the Bulgarians felt betrayed. The government of Vasil Radoslavov aligned Bulgaria with the German Empire and Austria-Hungary, even though this meant becoming an ally of the Ottomans, Bulgaria&#x27;s traditional enemy. But Bulgaria now had no claims against the Ottomans, whereas Serbia, Greece and Romania (allies of Britain and France) held lands perceived in Bulgaria as Bulgarian.

Bulgaria sat out the first year of World War I recuperating from the Balkan Wars. Germany and Austria realized they needed Bulgaria&#x27;s help in order to defeat Serbia militarily thereby opening supply lines from Germany to Turkey and bolstering the Eastern Front against Russia. Bulgaria insisted on major territorial gains, especially Macedonia, which Austria was reluctant to grant until Berlin insisted. Bulgaria also negotiated with the Allies, who offered somewhat less generous terms. The Tsar decided to go with Germany and Austria and signed an alliance with them in September 1915, along with a special Bulgarian-Turkish arrangement. It envisioned that Bulgaria would dominate the Balkans after the war.

Bulgaria, which had the land force in the Balkans, declared war on Serbia in October 1915. Britain, France and Italy responded by declaring war on Bulgaria. In alliance with Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottomans, Bulgaria won military victories against Serbia and Romania, occupying much of Macedonia (taking Skopje in October), advancing into Greek Macedonia, and taking Dobruja from Romania in September 1916. Thus Serbia was temporarily knocked out of the war, and Turkey was temporarily rescued from collapse. By 1917, Bulgaria fielded more than a quarter of its 4.5 million population in a 1,200,000-strong army, and inflicted heavy losses on Serbia (Kaymakchalan), Great Britain (Doiran), France (Monastir), the Russian Empire (Dobrich) and the Kingdom of Romania (Tutrakan).

However, the war soon became unpopular with most Bulgarians, who suffered great economic hardship and also disliked fighting their fellow Orthodox Christians in alliance with the Muslim Ottomans. The Agrarian Party leader Aleksandur Stamboliyski was imprisoned in 1915 for his opposition to the war. The Russian Revolution of February 1917 had a great effect in Bulgaria, spreading anti-war and anti-monarchist sentiment among the troops and in the cities. In June Radoslavov&#x27;s government resigned. Mutinies broke out in the army, Stamboliyski was released and a republic was proclaimed.

===Interwar years===
In September 1918, Tsar Ferdinand abdicated in favour of his son Boris III in order to head off anti-monarchic revolutionary tendencies. Under the Treaty of Neuilly (November 1919) Bulgaria ceded its Aegean coastline to Greece, recognized the existence of Yugoslavia, ceded nearly all of its Macedonian territory to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and had to give Dobruja back to Romania. The country had to reduce its army to no more than 22,000 men and pay reparations exceeding $400 million. Bulgarians generally refer to the results of the treaty as the &quot;Second National Catastrophe.&quot;

Elections in March 1920 gave the Agrarians a large majority and Aleksandar Stamboliyski formed Bulgaria&#x27;s first peasant government. He faced huge social problems, but succeeded in carrying out many reforms, although opposition from the middle and upper classes, the landlords and officers of the army remained powerful. In March 1923, Stamboliyski signed an agreement with the Kingdom of Yugoslavia recognising the new border and agreeing to suppress Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (VMRO), which favoured a war to regain Macedonia from Yugoslavia.

This triggered a nationalist reaction and the coup d&#x27;état of 9 June 1923 eventually resulted in Stamboliykski&#x27;s assassination. An extreme right-wing government under Aleksandar Tsankov took power, backed by the army and VMRO, which waged a White terror against Agrarians and Communists. In 1926, after the brief Incident at Petrich, the Tsar persuaded Tsankov to resign, a more moderate government under Andrey Lyapchev took office and an amnesty was proclaimed, although the Communists remained banned. A popular alliance, including the re-organised Agrarians, won the elections of 1931 under the name &quot;Popular Bloc&quot;.

In May 1934 another coup took place, removing the Popular Bloc from power and establishing an authoritarian military régime headed by Kimon Georgiev. A year later, Tsar Boris managed to remove the military régime from power, restoring a form of parliamentary rule (without the re-establishment of the political parties) and under his own strict control. The Tsar&#x27;s regime proclaimed neutrality, but gradually Bulgaria gravitated into alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.

===World War II===
Upon the outbreak of World War II, the government of the Kingdom of Bulgaria under Bogdan Filov declared a position of neutrality, being determined to observe it until the end of the war, but hoping for bloodless territorial gains, especially in the lands with a significant Bulgarian population occupied by neighbouring countries after the Second Balkan War and World War I. But it was clear that the central geopolitical position of Bulgaria in the Balkans would inevitably lead to strong external pressure by both sides of World War II. Turkey had a non-aggression pact with Bulgaria.

Bulgaria succeeded in negotiating a recovery of Southern Dobruja, part of Romania since 1913, in the Axis-sponsored Treaty of Craiova on 7 September 1940, which reinforced Bulgarian hopes for solving territorial problems without direct involvement in the war. However, Bulgaria was forced to join the Axis powers in 1941, when German troops that were preparing to invade Greece from Romania reached the Bulgarian borders and demanded permission to pass through Bulgarian territory. Threatened by direct military confrontation, Tsar Boris III had no choice but to join the fascist bloc, which was made official on 1 March 1941. There was little popular opposition, since the Soviet Union was in a non-aggression pact with Germany. However the king refused to hand over the Bulgarian Jews to the Nazis, saving 50,000 lives. Bulgaria sent occupation forces into eastern Serbia, Macedonia and northern Greece (territories it claimed as its own), where atrocities were committed and local Jews were sent to death camps. A resistance movement organised to fight against the Wehrmacht forces in Bulgaria and the Tsardom of Bulgaria authorities. It was mainly communist and pro-Soviet Union.
Bulgaria did not join the German invasion of the Soviet Union that began on 22 June 1941 nor did it declare war on the Soviet Union. However, despite the lack of official declarations of war by both sides, the Bulgarian Navy was involved in a number of skirmishes with the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, which attacked Bulgarian shipping. Besides this, Bulgarian armed forces garrisoned in the Balkans battled various resistance groups. The Bulgarian government was forced by Germany to declare a token war on the United Kingdom and the United States on 13 December 1941, an act which resulted in the bombing of Sofia and other Bulgarian cities by Allied aircraft.

On 23 August 1944, Romania left the Axis Powers and declared war on Germany, and allowed Soviet forces to cross its territory to reach Bulgaria. On 5 September 1944 the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria and invaded. Within three days, the Soviets occupied the northeastern part of Bulgaria along with the key port cities of Varna and Burgas. Meanwhile, on 5 of September, Bulgaria declared war on Nazi Germany. The Bulgarian Army was ordered to offer no resistance.

On 9 September 1944 in a coup the government of Prime Minister Konstantin Muraviev was overthrown and replaced with a government of the Fatherland Front led by Kimon Georgiev. On 16 September 1944 the Soviet Red Army entered Sofia. In October 1944, mobilisation was ordered and Bulgaria sent three armies to fight under the operational command of the Red Army&#x27;s 3rd Ukrainian Front to repel the Wehrmacht across Central Europe. The Bulgarian Army marked several victories against the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen (at Nish), the 22nd Infantry Division (at Strumica) and other German forces during the operations in Kosovo and at Stratsin. The Soviet army withdraws from Bulgaria after one year.

==People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria (1946–1991)==
From 1946 to 1991 the country was known as the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria (PRB) and was ruled by the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP). The BCP transformed itself in 1990, changing its name to &quot;Bulgarian Socialist Party&quot;.

Communist leader Georgi Dimitrov had been in exile, mostly in the Soviet Union, since 1923. Although Stalin executed many other exiles, he was close to Dimitrov and gave him high positions. Dimitrov was arrested in Berlin and showed great courage during the Reichstag fire trial of 1933. Stalin made him head of the Comintern during the period of the Popular Front.

After 1944 he was also close to the Yugoslav Communist leader Josip Broz Tito and believed that Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, as closely related South Slav peoples, should form a federation. This idea was not favoured by Stalin. There have long been suspicions that Dimitrov&#x27;s sudden death in Moscow in July 1949 was not accidental, although this has never been proven. It coincided with Stalin&#x27;s expulsion of Tito from the Cominform and was followed by a &quot;Titoist&quot; witch hunt in Bulgaria. This culminated in the show trial and execution of Deputy Prime Minister Traicho Kostov (died 16 December 1949). The elderly Prime Minister Vasil Kolarov (born 1877) died in January 1950 and power then passed to a Stalinist, Vulko Chervenkov (1900–1980).

Bulgaria&#x27;s Stalinist phase lasted less than five years. Under his leadership, agriculture was collectivised and a massive industrialisation campaign was launched. Bulgaria adopted a centrally planned economy, similar to those in other COMECON states. In the mid-1940s, when collectivisation began, Bulgaria was a primarily agrarian state, with some 80% of its population located in rural areas. In 1950 diplomatic relations with the U.S. were broken off. But Chervenkov&#x27;s support base in the Communist Party was too narrow for him to survive long once his patron Stalin was gone. Stalin died in March 1953 and in March 1954 Chervenkov was deposed as Party Secretary with the approval of the new leadership in Moscow and replaced by Todor Zhivkov. Chervenkov stayed on as Prime Minister until April 1955, when he was dismissed and replaced by Anton Yugov.

Bulgaria experienced a rapid industrial development from the 1950s onwards. From the following decade, the country&#x27;s economy appeared profoundly transformed. Although many difficulties remained, such as poor housing and inadequate urban infrastructure, modernisation was a reality. The country then turned to high technology, a sector which represented 14% of its GDP between 1985 and 1990. Its factories produce processors, hard disks, floppy disk drives and industrial robots.

During the 1960s, Zhivkov initiated reforms and passed some market-oriented policies on an experimental level. By the mid-1950s standards of living rose significantly, and in 1957 collective farm workers benefited from the first agricultural pension and welfare system in Eastern Europe. Lyudmila Zhivkova, daughter of Todor Zhivkov, promoted Bulgaria&#x27;s national heritage, culture and arts on a global scale. An assimilation campaign of the late 1980s directed against ethnic Turks resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 Bulgarian Turks to Turkey, which caused a significant drop in agricultural production due to the loss of labor force.

== Republic of Bulgaria (since 1989) ==

By the time the impact of Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s reform program in the Soviet Union was felt in Bulgaria in the late 1980s, the Communists, like their leader, had grown too feeble to resist the demand for change for long. In November 1989 demonstrations on ecological issues were staged in Sofia and these soon broadened into a general campaign for political reform. The Communists reacted by deposing Zhivkov and replacing him by Petar Mladenov, but this gained them only a short respite.

In February 1990 the Communist Party voluntarily gave up its monopoly on power and in June 1990 the first free elections since 1931 were held. The result was a return to power by the Communist Party, now shorn of its hardliner wing and renamed the Bulgarian Socialist Party. In July 1991 a new Constitution was adopted, in which the system of government was fixed as parliamentary republic with a directly elected President and a Prime Minister accountable to the legislature.
Like the other post-Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, Bulgaria found the transition to capitalism more painful than expected. The anti-Communist Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) took office and between 1992 and 1994 the Berov Government carried through the privatisation of land and industry through the issue of shares in government enterprises to all citizens, but these were accompanied by massive unemployment as uncompetitive industries failed and the backward state of Bulgaria&#x27;s industry and infrastructure were revealed. The Socialists portrayed themselves as the defender of the poor against the excesses of the free market.

The negative reaction against economic reform allowed Zhan Videnov of the BSP to take office in 1995. By 1996 the BSP government was also in difficulties and in the presidential election of that year the UDF&#x27;s Petar Stoyanov was elected. In 1997 the BSP government collapsed and the UDF came to power. Unemployment, however, remained high and the electorate became increasingly dissatisfied with both parties.

On 17 June 2001, Simeon II, the son of Tsar Boris III and himself the former Head of state (as Tsar of Bulgaria from 1943 to 1946), won a narrow victory in elections. The Tsar&#x27;s party — National Movement Simeon II (&quot;NMSII&quot;) — won 120 of the 240 seats in Parliament. Simeon&#x27;s popularity declined quickly during his four-year rule as Prime Minister and the BSP won the election in 2005, but could not form a single-party government and had to seek a coalition. In the parliamentary elections in July 2009, Boyko Borisov&#x27;s right-centrist party Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria won nearly 40% of the votes.

Since 1989 Bulgaria has held multi-party elections and privatized its economy, but economic difficulties and a tide of corruption have led over 800,000 Bulgarians, including many qualified professionals, to emigrate in a &quot;brain drain&quot;. The reform package introduced in 1997 restored positive economic growth, but led to rising social inequality. The political and economic system after 1989 virtually failed to improve both the living standards and create economic growth. According to a 2009 Pew Global Attitudes Project survey, 76% of Bulgarians said they were dissatisfied with the system of democracy, 63% thought that free markets did not make people better off and only 11% of Bulgarians agreed that ordinary people had benefited from the changes in 1989. Furthermore, the average quality of life and economic performance actually remained lower than in the times of socialism well into the early 2000s (decade).

Bulgaria became a member of NATO on 29 March 2004 and of the European Union on 1 January 2007. In 2010 it was ranked 32nd (between Greece and Lithuania) out of 181 countries in the Globalization Index. 
The freedom of speech and of the press are respected by the government (as of 2015), but many media outlets are beholden to major advertisers and owners with political agendas. Also see Human rights in Bulgaria. Polls carried out seven years after the country&#x27;s accession to the EU found only 15% of Bulgarians felt they had personally benefited from the membership.

<text>The history of [[Burkina Faso]] includes the history of various kingdoms within the country, such as the Mossi kingdoms, as well as the later French colonisation of the territory and its independence as the Republic of Upper Volta in 1960.

==Ancient and medieval history==
Iron production occurred in regions near Douroula at least as far back as the 8th century BC and was widely practiced across the region by the 5th century BC. Furnaces, mines, and surrounding dwellings dating from this time period are found across the country.

Recent archeological discoveries at Bura in southwest Niger and in adjacent southwest Burkina Faso have documented the existence of the iron-age Bura culture from the 3rd century to the 13th century. The Bura-Asinda system of settlements apparently covered the lower Niger River valley, including the Boura region of Burkina Faso. Further research is needed to understand the role this early culture played in the ancient and medieval history of West Africa.

Loropéni is an ancient stone ruin which was linked to the gold trade between the 14th and 17th centuries. It is a World Heritage Site.

From medieval times until the end of the 19th century, the central region of present-day Burkina Faso was ruled by the Mossi people, descendants of warriors of the Dagomba people of present-day Ghana, who mixed with Mandé and other local peoples in the 11th century. During this time the Mossi Kingdoms successfully defended their territory, religious beliefs and social structure against forcible attempts at conquest and conversion by their Muslim neighbors to the northwest.

==French Upper Volta==
The French arrived and claimed the area in 1896, but Mossi resistance ended only with the capture of their capital Ouagadougou in 1901. In 1919, certain provinces from Ivory Coast were united into French Upper Volta in the French West Africa federation. In 1932, the new colony was split up for economic reasons; it was reconstituted in 1937 as an administrative division called the Upper Coast. After World War II, the Mossi actively pressured the French for separate territorial status and on September 4, 1947, Upper Volta became a French West African territory again in its own right.

A revision in the organization of French Overseas Territories began with the passage of the Basic Law (Loi Cadre) of July 23, 1956. This act was followed by reorganizational measures approved by the French parliament early in 1957 that ensured a large degree of self-government for individual territories. Upper Volta became an autonomous republic in the French community on December 11, 1958. On July 11, 1960, France agreed to Upper Volta becoming fully independent.

==Republic of Upper Volta==
The Republic of Upper Volta declared independence on 5 August 1960. The first president, Maurice Yaméogo, was the leader of the Voltaic Democratic Union (UDV). The 1960 constitution provided for election by universal suffrage of a president and a national assembly for 5-year terms. Soon after coming to power, Yaméogo banned all political parties other than the UDV. Yaméogo&#x27;s government was viewed as corrupt and said to perpetuate neo-colonialism by favoring French political and economic interests which had allowed politicians to enrich themselves but not the nation&#x27;s peasants or small class of urban workers.

The government lasted until 1966 when—after much unrest including mass demonstrations and strikes by students, labor unions, and civil servants—the military intervened and deposed Yaméogo in the 1966 Upper Voltan coup d&#x27;état. The coup leaders suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and placed Lieutenant Colonel Sangoulé Lamizana at the head of a government of senior army officers. The army remained in power for 4 years; on June 14, 1970, the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a 4-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments. He faced a major crisis in the form of the Sahel drought and was sent in 1973 to the UN and the US in order to secure aid. After conflict over the 1970 constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977, and Lamizana was reelected by open elections in 1978.

Lamizana&#x27;s government faced problems with the country&#x27;s traditionally powerful trade unions, and on November 25, 1980, Colonel Saye Zerbo overthrew President Lamizana in a bloodless coup. Colonel Zerbo established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress as the supreme governmental authority, thus eradicating the 1977 constitution.

Colonel Zerbo also encountered resistance from trade unions and was overthrown two years later on November 7, 1982, by Major Dr. Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo and the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP). The CSP continued to ban political parties and organizations, yet promised a transition to civilian rule and a new constitution.

Infighting developed between the right and left factions of the CSP. The leader of the leftists, Capt. Thomas Sankara, was appointed prime minister in January 1983, but subsequently arrested. Efforts to free him, directed by Capt. Blaise Compaoré, resulted in a military coup d&#x27;état on 4 August 1983.

The coup brought Sankara to power and his government began to implement a series of revolutionary programs which included mass-vaccinations, infrastructure improvements, the expansion of women&#x27;s rights, encouragement of domestic agricultural consumption and anti-desertification projects.

==Burkina Faso==

On 2 August 1984, on President Sankara&#x27;s initiative, the country&#x27;s name was changed from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso (&quot;land of the upright/honest people&quot;). The presidential decree was confirmed by the National Assembly on 4 August.

Sankara&#x27;s government formed the National Council for the Revolution (CNR), with Sankara as its president, and established popular Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDRs). The Pioneers of the Revolution youth programme was also established.

Sankara launched an ambitious socioeconomic programme for change, one of the largest ever undertaken on the African continent. His foreign policies were centred on anti-imperialism, his government denying all foreign aid, pushing for odious debt reduction, nationalising all land and mineral wealth and averting the power and influence of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. His domestic policies included a nationwide literacy campaign, land redistribution to peasants, railway and road construction and the outlawing of female genital mutilation, forced marriages and polygamy.

Sankara pushed for agrarian self-sufficiency and promoted public health by vaccinating 2,500,000 children against meningitis, yellow fever, and measles. His national agenda also included planting over 10,000,000 trees to halt the growing desertification of the Sahel. Sankara called on every village to build a medical dispensary and had over 350 communities build schools with their own labour.

===Five-day War with Mali===

On Christmas Day 1985, tensions with Mali over the mineral-rich Agacher Strip erupted in a war that lasted five days and killed about 100 people. The conflict ended after mediation by President Félix Houphouët-Boigny of Ivory Coast. The conflict is known as the &quot;Christmas war&quot; in Burkina Faso.

===Rule of Blaise Compaoré===

The CDRs, which were formed as popular mass organizations, deteriorated in some areas into gangs of armed thugs and clashed with several trade unions. Tensions over the repressive tactics of the government and its overall direction mounted steadily. On October 15, 1987, Sankara was assassinated in a coup which brought Captain Blaise Compaoré to power.
Compaoré, Captain Henri Zongo, and Major Jean-Baptiste Boukary Lengani formed the Popular Front (FP), which pledged to continue and pursue the goals of the revolution and to &quot;rectify&quot; Sankara&#x27;s &quot;deviations&quot; from the original aims. The new government, in aims of bourgeois support, tacitly moderated many of Sankara&#x27;s policies. As part of a much-discussed political &quot;opening&quot; process, several political organizations, three of them non-Marxist, were accepted under an umbrella political organization created in June 1989 by the FP.

Some members of the leftist Organisation pour la Démocratie Populaire/Mouvement du Travail (ODP/MT) were against the admission of non-Marxist groups in the front. On September 18, 1989, while Compaoré was returning from a two-week trip to Asia, Lengani and Zongo were accused of plotting to overthrow the Popular Front. They were arrested and summarily executed the same night. Compaoré reorganized the government, appointed several new ministers, and assumed the portfolio of Minister of Defense and Security. On December 23, 1989, a presidential security detail arrested about 30 civilians and military personnel accused of plotting a coup in collaboration with the Burkinabe external opposition.

Burkina Faso adopted a new constitution on June 2, 1991.

In 2005, Compaoré elected to his third term. In November 2010, President Compaoré was re–elected for a fourth straight term. He won 80.2% of the vote, while Hama Arba Diallo came a distant second with 8.2%.

In February 2011, the death of a schoolboy provoked an uprising in the entire country, lasting through April 2011, which was coupled with a military mutiny and with a strike of the magistrates. See .

===Overthrow of Compaoré===

In June 2014 Compaoré&#x27;s ruling party, the CDP, called on him to organise a referendum that would allow him to alter the constitution in order to seek re-election in 2015; otherwise he would be forced to step down due to term limits.

On 30 October 2014 the National Assembly was scheduled to debate an amendment to the constitution which would have enabled Compaoré to stand for re-election as president in 2015. Opponents protested this by storming the parliament building in Ouagadougou, starting fires inside it and looting offices; billowing smoke was reported to be coming from the building by the BBC. Opposition spokesman Pargui Emile Paré, of the People&#x27;s Movement for Socialism / Federal Party, described the protests as &quot;Burkina Faso’s black spring, like the Arab spring&quot;.

Compaoré reacted to the events by shelving the proposed constitutional changes, dissolving the government, declaring a state of emergency and offering to work with the opposition to resolve the crisis. Later in the day, the military, under General Honore Traore, announced that it would install a transitional government &quot;in consultation with all parties&quot; and that the National Assembly was dissolved; he foresaw &quot;a return to the constitutional order&quot; within a year. He did not make clear what role, if any, he envisioned for Compaoré during the transitional period. Compaoré said that he was prepared to leave office at the end of the transition.

On October 31 Compaoré announced he had left the presidency and that there was a &quot;power vacuum&quot;; he also called for a &quot;free and transparent&quot; election within 90 days. Yacouba Isaac Zida then took over the reins as head of state in an interim capacity.

On 17 November 2014, a civilian, Michel Kafando, was chosen to replace Zida as transitional head of state, and he was sworn in on 18 November. Kafando then appointed Zida as Prime Minister of Burkina Faso on 19 November 2014.

On 19 July 2015, amidst tensions between the military and Prime Minister Zida, Kafando stripped Zida of the defense portfolio and took over the portfolio himself. He also took over the security portfolio, previously held by Zida&#x27;s ally Auguste Denise Barry. As part of the same reshuffle, he appointed Moussa Nébié to replace himself as Minister of Foreign Affairs.

=== September 2015 failed coup d&#x27;état ===
On 16 September 2015, two days after a recommendation from the National Reconciliation and Reforms Commission to disband the Regiment of Presidential Security (RSP), members of the RSP detained President Kafando and Prime Minister Zida, and installed the National Council for Democracy in power with Gilbert Diendéré as its chairman.

The military chief of staff (the &quot;chef d&#x27;état-major des armées du Burkina Faso&quot;), Brigadier General Pingrenoma Zagré, called on members of the RSP to lay down their arms, promising in a statement that they would not be harmed if they surrendered peacefully.

Kafando was believed to remain under house arrest until 21 September, when he was reported to have arrived at the residence of the French ambassador. The regular army issued an ultimatum to the RSP to surrender by the morning of 22 September.

Kafando was reinstalled as president at a ceremony on 23 September in the presence of ECOWAS leaders.

On 25 September the RSP was disbanded by government decree. On 26 September the assets of Diendéré and others associated with the coup, as well as the assets of four political parties, including the CDP, were frozen by the state prosecutor. Djibril Bassolé and Eddie Komboïgo, who were barred from standing as presidential candidates, both had their assets frozen. Bassolé was arrested on 29 September for allegedly supporting the coup.

=== 2015 general election ===

On 13 October 2015 it was announced that general elections would be held on 29 November 2015. The Congress for Democracy and Progress was banned from running a presidential candidate, but was still able to participate in the parliamentary election.

The presidential election was won by Roch Marc Christian Kaboré of the People&#x27;s Movement for Progress (MPP), who received 53% of the vote in the first round, negating the need for a second round. The parliamentary election was also won by MPP, which scored 34,71% of votes and won 55 seats in the National Assembly, followed by the Union of Progress and Reform (20,53%, 33 seats) and the Congress for Democracy and Progress (13,20%, 18 seats).

Kaboré was sworn in as president on 29 December 2015. On 7 January 2016 he appointed Paul Kaba Thieba as Prime Minister.

=== 2018 status ===
The 2018 CIA &quot;World Factbook&quot; provides this updated summary. &quot;Burkina Faso is a poor, landlocked country that depends on adequate rainfall. Irregular patterns of rainfall, poor soil, and the lack of adequate communications and other infrastructure contribute to the economy’s vulnerability to external shocks. About 80% of the population is engaged in subsistence farming and cotton is the main cash crop. The country has few natural resources and a weak industrial base. Cotton and gold are Burkina Faso’s key exports ...The country has seen an upswing in gold exploration, production, and exports.&quot;

&quot;While the end of the political crisis has allowed Burkina Faso’s economy to resume positive growth, the country’s fragile security situation could put these gains at risk. Political insecurity in neighboring Mali, unreliable energy supplies, and poor transportation links pose long-term challenges.&quot; Civil unrest continued to be problematic, according to the report. &quot;The country experienced terrorist attacks in its capital in 2016, 2017, and 2018 and continues to mobilize resources to counter terrorist threats.&quot; (In 2018, several governments were warning their citizens not to travel into the northern part of the country and into several provinces in the East Region.) The CIA report also states that &quot;Burkina Faso&#x27;s high population growth, recurring drought, pervasive and perennial food insecurity, and limited natural resources result in poor economic prospects for the majority of its citizens&quot;. The report is optimistic in some aspects, particularly the work being done with assistance by the International Monetary Fund. &quot;A new three-year IMF program (2018-2020), approved in 2018, will allow the government to reduce the budget deficit and preserve critical spending on social services and priority public investments.&quot;

=== November 2020 election ===
In 2020 general election, President Roch Marc Christian Kaboré was re-elected. However, his party Mouvement du people MPP, failed to reach absolute parliamentary majority. It secured 56 seats out of a total of 127. The Congress for Democracy and Progress (CDP), the party of former President Blaise Compaoré, was distant second with 20 seats.

=== 2022 military coups ===

On 24 January 2022, President Roch Kaboré was ousted in a military coup. Lieutenant Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba was the leader of Patriotic Movement for Safeguard and Restoration (MPSR), which included all sections of the army. MPSR announced that it had decided to end President Kabore&#x27;s post. On 31 January, the ruling military government appointed coup leader Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba as interim president. The African Union (AU) suspended the membership of Burkina Faso.

On 30 September 2022 the second military coup took place and Damiba was ousted over his inability to deal with an Islamist insurgency. Captain Ibrahim Traoré took over as interim leader. President Damiba resigned and left the country. On 6 October 2022, Captain Ibrahim Traore was officially appointed as president of Burkina Faso.

<doc id="42545" wikidata="Q797422" url="?curid=42545" title="Republic of Upper Volta">
<text>The Republic of Upper Volta () was a landlocked West African country established on 11 December 1958 as a self-governing state within the French Community. Before becoming autonomous, it had been part of the French Union as the French Upper Volta. On 5 August 1960, it gained full independence from France. On 4 August 1984, it changed its name to Burkina Faso.

== Etymology ==
The name Upper Volta indicated that the country contains the upper part of the Volta River.

== History ==
Upper Volta obtained independence on 5 August 1960, with Maurice Yaméogo of the Voltaic Democratic Union-African Democratic Rally (UDV-RDA) becoming the country&#x27;s first president. A constitution was ratified the same year, establishing presidential elections by direct universal suffrage and a National Assembly, both with five-year terms. Shortly after coming to power, Yaméogo banned all political parties other than the UDV-RDA. He had shown a deep authoritarian streak even before becoming president. Between the time he became prime minister of Upper Volta while it was still a French colony and independence two years later, opposition parties were subjected to increased harassment.

On 3 January 1966, Yaméogo was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état led by army chief Sangoulé Lamizana. Although multiparty democracy was nominally restored four years later, Lamizana dominated the country&#x27;s politics until he was himself overthrown in 1980.

After a series of short-term presidencies, Thomas Sankara then came to power through yet another military coup d&#x27;état on 4 August 1983. After the coup, he formed the National Council for the Revolution (CNR), with himself as president. Under the direction of Sankara, the country changed its name on 4 August 1984, from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso, which means &quot;Land of Incorruptible People&quot;.

== Politics ==
From 1958 to 1960, the Republic of Upper Volta was led by a high commissioner:
*Max Berthet (11 December 1958 to February 1959),
*Paul Masson (February 1959 to 5 August 1960).
From 1971 to 1987, the Republic of Upper Volta was led by a prime minister:
*Gérard Kango Ouédraogo (13 February 1971 to 8 February 1974)
*Thomas Sankara (4 August 1983 to 14 October 1987)
== Symbols ==

=== Flag ===

The colours of the national flag corresponded to the names of the Volta&#x27;s three main tributaries: the Black Volta, the White Volta and the Red Volta.

=== National Hymn ===

In French:

&quot;Fière Volta de mes aieux,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Ton soleil ardent et glorieux&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Te revêt d&#x27;or et de fierté&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Ô Reine drapée de loyauté !&quot;

&quot;Nous te ferons et plus forte, et plus belle&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;À ton amour nous resterons fidèles&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Et nos cœurs vibrant de fierté&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Acclameront ta beauté&quot;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;Vers l&#x27;horizon lève les yeux&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Frémis aux accents tumultueux&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;De tes fiers enfants tous dressés&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Promesses d&#x27;avenir caressées&quot;

&quot;Le travail de ton sol brûlant&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Sans fin trempera les cœurs ardents,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Et les vertus de tes enfants&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Le ceindront d&#x27;un diadème triomphant.&quot;

&quot;Que Dieu te garde en sa bonté,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Que du bonheur de ton sol aimé,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;L&#x27;Amour des frères soit la clé,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Honneur, Unité et Liberté.&quot;

In English:

Proud Volta of my ancestors,&lt;br&gt;
Your ardent and glorious sun&lt;br&gt;
Takes you with gold and pride&lt;br&gt;
O Queen draped with loyalty!

We will make you stronger and more beautiful&lt;br&gt;
To your love we will remain faithful&lt;br&gt;
And our hearts vibrant with pride&lt;br&gt;
Will acclaim your beauty&lt;br&gt;
Towards the horizon look up&lt;br&gt;
Frisks with the tumultuous accents&lt;br&gt;
Of your proud children all trained&lt;br&gt;
Caressed promises of future

The work of your burning ground&lt;br&gt;
Endless will soak the ardent hearts,&lt;br&gt;
And the virtues of your children&lt;br&gt;
The girdle of a triumphant diadem.

May God keep you in his goodness,&lt;br&gt;
May the happiness of your beloved soil,&lt;br&gt;
The love of the brethren be the key,&lt;br&gt;
Honor, Unity and Freedom.
This anthem was replaced in 1984 by a new anthem, the Ditanyè.

==Cultural references==
During the 1960s, the Soviet Union was sometimes derisively referred to as &quot;Upper Volta with rockets&quot;, coined by a journalist Xan Smiley, referencing USSR&#x27;s disproportion of defence sector over relatively undeveloped civilian economy.

<text>Human arrival in [[Ivory Coast]] (officially called Côte d&#x27;Ivoire) has been dated to the Upper Paleolithic period (15,000 to 10,000 BC), or at the minimum, the Neolithic period based on weapon and tool fragments, specifically polished shale axes and remnants of cooking and fishing. The earliest known inhabitants of left traces scattered throughout the territory. Historians believe these people were all either displaced or absorbed by the ancestors of the present inhabitants. Peoples who arrived before the 16th century include the Ehotilé (Aboisso), Kotrowou (Fresco), Zéhiri (Grand Lahou), Ega, and Diès (Divo).

==Prehistory and early history==
Little is known about the original inhabitants of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. The first recorded history is in the chronicles of North African Muslims who conducted a caravan trade across the Sahara in salt, slaves, gold, and other items from early Roman times. The southern terminals of the trans-Saharan trade routes were located on the edge of the desert, and from there, supplemental trade extended as far south as the edge of the rainforest. The more important terminals—Djenné, Gao, and Timbuctu—grew into major commercial centers around which the great Sudanic empires developed. These empires dominated neighboring states by controlling the trade routes with powerful military forces. 

The Sudanic empires also became centers of Islamic learning. Islam was introduced into western Sudan by Arab traders from North Africa and spread rapidly after the conversion of many important rulers. By the 11th century, the rulers of the Sudan empires had embraced Islam that spread south into the northern areas of contemporary Ivory Coast.

Ghana was the earliest of the Sudan empires; it flourished in present-day eastern Mauritania from the fourth to the 13th century. At the peak of its power in the 11th century, its realms extended from the Atlantic Ocean to Timbuctu. After the decline of Ghana Empire, the Mali Empire grew into a powerful Muslim state, reaching its peak in the early 14th century. The territory of the Mali Empire in Ivory Coast was limited to the northwest corner around Odienné. 

The Songhai Empire flourished there between the 14th and 16th centuries. Songhai was weakened by internal discord, leading to factional warfare. This discord spurred the migrations of peoples southward toward the forest belt. 

The dense rainforest in the south created barriers to large-scale political organizations like those in the north. In the south, people lived in villages or village clusters whose contacts with the outside world came through long-distance traders. These villagers subsisted on agriculture and hunting.

== Pre-European era ==
Five important states flourished in Ivory Coast in the pre-European era. The Bono kingdom of Gyaman was established in the 17th century by the Abron, an Akan group that fled the developing Ashanti Empire in Ghana. From their settlement south of Bondoukou, the Abron gradually extended their dominance of the Juula, recent emigrants from the market city of Begho. Bondoukou developed into a major center of commerce and Islam. The kingdom&#x27;s Quranic scholars attracted students from all parts of West Africa. 

In the mid-18th century in east-central Ivory Coast, other Akan groups fleeing the Ashanti Empire established a Baoulé kingdom at Sakasso and two Agni kingdoms, Indénié and Sanwi. The Baoulé, like the Ashanti, elaborated a highly centralized political and administrative structure under three successive rulers, but it finally split into smaller chiefdoms. Despite the breakup of their kingdom, the Baoulé strongly resisted French subjugation. The descendants of the rulers of the Agni kingdoms tried to retain their separate identity long after Ivory Coast&#x27;s independence; as late as 1969, the Sanwi of Krinjabo attempted to break away from Ivory Coast and form an independent kingdom.

In the early 18th century, the Juula established the Muslim Kong Empire in the north-central region inhabited by the Sénoufo, who fled Islamization under the Mali Empire. The Kong Empire was a prosperous center of agriculture, trade, and crafts but weakened gradually because of ethnic diversity and religious discord. The city of Kong was destroyed in 1895 by Samori Touré.

==Trade with Europe and the Americas==
Because of its location between Europe and the imagined treasures of the Far East, Africa became a destination for the European explorers of the 15th century. The first Europeans to explore the West African coast were the Portuguese. Other European sea powers followed and established trade with many of the coastal peoples of West Africa. At first, trade included gold, ivory, and pepper but the establishment of American colonies in the 16th century spurred demand for slaves. This led to the kidnapping and enslaving of people from the West African coastal regions for transportation to North and South America (see African slave trade). Local rulers obtained goods and slaves from the inhabitants of the interior to fulfill treaties with the Europeans. By the end of the 15th century, trade with the Europeans had resulted in a strong European influence in Africa, permeating north from the West African coast.

Ivory Coast, like the rest of West Africa, was subject to these influences but the absence of sheltered harbors along its coastline prevented Europeans from establishing permanent trading posts. Thus, seaborne trade was irregular and played only a minor role in the penetration and eventual conquest of Ivory Coast by Europeans. The slave trade, in particular, had little effect on the peoples of Ivory Coast. A profitable trade in ivory existed in the 17th century and gave the area its name. However, the resulting decline in elephant population ended the ivory trade by the beginning of the 18th century.

The earliest recorded French voyage to West Africa was in 1483. The French founded their first West African settlement, Saint Louis, in the mid-17th century in what is now Senegal; around this time, the Dutch ceded a settlement at Ile de Gorée to the French. The French established a mission in 1687 at Assinie, near the Gold Coast (now Ghana) border, and it became the first European outpost in that area. Although Assini&#x27;s survival was precarious, the French did not establish themselves in Ivory Coast until the mid-19th century. By that time, the French had settlements around the mouth of the Senegal River and at other points along the coasts of Senegal, Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau. Meanwhile, the British had permanent outposts in the same areas and on the Gulf of Guinea, east of Ivory Coast.

In the 18th century, Ivory Coast was invaded by two related Akan groups—the Agni, who occupied the southeast, and the Baoulés, who settled in the central section. In 1843–1844, the French admiral Bouët-Willaumez signed treaties with the kings of the Grand Bassam and Assini regions, placing these territories under a French protectorate. French explorers, missionaries, trading companies, and soldiers gradually extended the area under French control inland from the lagoon region. 

Activity along the coast stimulated European interest in the interior, especially along Senegal and Niger rivers. French exploration of West Africa began in the mid-19th century but moved slowly and was based more on individual initiative than government policy. In the 1840s, the French concluded a series of treaties with local West African rulers, enabling the French to build fortified posts along the Gulf of Guinea to serve as permanent trading centers. The first posts in Ivory Coast were at Assinie and Grand-Bassam, which became the colony&#x27;s first capital. The treaties gave the French sovereignty for trading privileges in exchange for fees or customs paid annually to the local rulers for the use of their land. This arrangement was not entirely satisfactory to the French because trade was limited and misunderstandings over treaty obligations often arose. Nevertheless, the French government maintained the treaties, hoping to expand trade. France also wanted to maintain a presence in the region to limit the growing influence of the British along the Gulf of Guinea coast.

The defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War (1871) and the subsequent annexation of the French province of Alsace-Lorraine by Germany caused the French government to abandon its colonial ambitions and withdraw its military garrisons from its West African trading posts, leaving them in the care of resident merchants. The trading post at Grand-Bassam was left to Arthur Verdier, a shipper from Marseille who was named a resident minister when the Ivory Coast was established in 1878.

In 1885, France and Germany brought the European powers with interests in Africa together at the Berlin Conference. The conference helped rationalize what became known as the European scramble for Africa. Prince Otto von Bismarck also wanted a greater role in Africa for Germany, which he thought he could achieve in part by fostering competition between France and Britain. The agreement signed by all conference participants in 1885 stipulated that on the African coastline, only European annexations or spheres of influence that involved effective occupation by Europeans would be recognized. Another agreement in 1890 extended this rule to the interior of Africa and resulted in a rush for territory by France, Britain, Portugal, and Belgium.

==Establishment of French rule==
To support its claims of effective occupation, France again assumed direct control of its West African coastal trading posts and embarked on an accelerated program of exploration in the interior in 1886. In 1887, Lieutenant Louis Gustave Binger began a two-year journey across Ivory Coast&#x27;s interior. By the end of his journey, Binger had secured four treaties that established French protectorates in Ivory Coast. Also in 1887, Verdier&#x27;s agent, Marcel Treich-Laplène, negotiated five additional agreements that extended French influence from the headwaters of the Niger River Basin through Ivory Coast.

By the end of the 1880s, France had established effective control over the coastal regions of Ivory Coast and Britain recognized French sovereignty in the area in 1889. France named Treich-Laplène the titular governor of the territory in 1889. In 1893, Ivory Coast was made a French colony; agreements with Liberia in 1892 and with Britain in 1893 determined the eastern and western boundaries of the colony, but the northern boundary was not fixed until 1947 when the French government wanted to attach parts of Upper Volta (present-day Burkina Faso) and French Sudan (present-day Mali) to Ivory Coast for economic and administrative reasons.Throughout the process of partition, the Africans were little concerned with the occasional European who came wandering by. Many local rulers of small, isolated communities did not understand or, more often, were misled by the French about the significance of treaties that compromised their authority. However, other local leaders thought that the French could solve economic problems or become allies in the event of a dispute with belligerent neighbors. In the end, the loss of sovereignty by the local rulers was often the result of their inability to counter French deception and military force, rather than a result of support for French encroachment.

== French colonial era ==
Côte d&#x27;Ivoire officially became a French colony on 10 March 1893. Louis Gustave Binger who had explored the Gold Coast frontier, was named the first governor. He negotiated boundary treaties with Liberia and Britain (for the Gold Coast). Throughout the early years of French rule, French military contingents went inland to establish new posts. The French settlements encountered resistance from locals, even in areas with treaties of protection. Samori Touré offered the greatest resistance; he had established the Wassoulou Empire over large parts of present-day Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Ivory Coast starting in 1878. Tourés large, well-equipped army could manufacture and repair its own firearms, attracting strong support throughout the region. Binger responded to Touré&#x27;s expansion of regional control with military pressure, resulting in fierce resistance. The French campaigns against the Wassoulou intensified in the mid-1890s until they captured Touré in 1898.

In 1900, France imposed a head tax for a public works program in the colony, provoking several revolts. The public works programs and the related exploitation of natural resources required a huge workforce. The French imposed a system of forced labor, requiring each adult male Ivorian to work ten days each year without compensation as an obligation to the state. This system was subject to extreme misuse and was the most hated aspect of French colonial rule by the Africans. Because the population of Ivory Coast was insufficient to meet the labor demands of French-held plantations and forests, the greatest users of labor in French West Africa, the French recruited large numbers of workers from Upper Volta to Ivory Coast. The forced labor was not only disadvantageous to the men forced to work but also to the Ivorian farmers as well. As farming gained importance to the economic growth of Ivory Coast, European and African farmers alike worked diligently to enlarge their businesses. This inherently caused a need for more workers, a need far greater than the number of workers available. During this time, amidst World War II, the French government systematically gave worker preference to the European farmers and made the African farmers find voluntary workers locally or close up shop entirely. These systemic injustices caused great strife between the African working class as they were growing further apart from their European counterparts and had little to no say in the matter as none of them were recognized, French citizens. This labor source was so important to the economic life of Ivory Coast that in 1932 the AOF annexed a large part of Upper Volta to Ivory Coast and administered it as a single colony. Many Ivorians viewed the head tax as a violation of the terms of the protectorate treaties because it seemed that France was now demanding a &quot;coutume or&quot; payment from the local kings rather than the reverse. Much of the population, especially in the interior, considered the tax a humiliating symbol of submission.

From 1904 to 1958, Ivory Coast was a constituent unit of the Federation of French West Africa. It was a colony and an overseas territory under the Third Republic. Until the period following World War II, governmental affairs in French West Africa were administered from Paris. France&#x27;s policy in West Africa was reflected mainly in its philosophy of &quot;association&quot;, meaning that all Africans in Ivory Coast were officially French subjects without rights to representation in Africa or France. In 1905, the French officially abolished slavery in most of French West Africa.

In 1908, Gabriel Angoulvant was appointed governor of Ivory Coast. Angoulvant had little prior experience in Africa but believed that the development of Ivory Coast could proceed only after the forceful conquest, or so-called pacification, of the colony. He sent military expeditions into the hinterland to quell resistance. As a result of these expeditions, local rulers were compelled to obey existing antislavery laws, supply porters and food to the French forces, and ensure the protection of French trade and personnel. In return, the French agreed to leave local customs intact and specifically promised not to intervene in the selection of rulers. However, the French often disregarded their side of the agreement, deporting or interning rulers seen as instigators of revolt. They also regrouped villages and established a uniform administration throughout most of the colony. Finally, they replaced the &quot;coutume&quot; system with an allowance based on performance.

French colonial policy incorporated concepts of assimilation and association. Assimilation presupposed the inherent superiority of French culture over all others; the assimilation policy in the colony meant the extension of the French language, institutions, laws, and customs. The policy of association not only affirmed the superiority of the French but also entailed different institutions and systems of laws for the colonizer and the colonized. Under this policy, the Africans in Ivory Coast were allowed to preserve their customs insofar as they were compatible with French interests. An indigenous elite trained in French administrative practice formed an intermediary group between the French and the Africans.

Assimilation was practiced in Ivory Coast to the extent that a small number of Westernised Ivorians were granted the right to apply for French citizenship after 1930. However, most Ivorians were classified as French subjects with no political rights under the principle of association. Moreover, they were drafted for work in mines, on plantations, as porters, and on public projects as part of their tax responsibility. They were also expected to serve in the military and were subject to the indigénat, a separate system of laws for Africans.

In World War II, the Vichy regime remained in control until 1943, when members of General Charles De Gaulle&#x27;s provisional government assumed control of all French West Africa. The Brazzaville conference in 1944, the first Constituent Assembly of the Fourth Republic in 1946, and France&#x27;s gratitude for African loyalty during World War II led to far-reaching governmental reforms in 1946. French citizenship was granted to all African &quot;subjects,&quot; the right to organize politically was recognized, and various forms of forced labor were abolished. A turning point in relations with France was reached with the 1956 Overseas Reform Act or Loi-cadre Defferre, which transferred several powers from Paris to elected territorial governments in French West Africa and also removed remaining voting inequalities.

Until 1958, governors appointed in Paris administered the colony of Ivory Coast, using a system of direct, centralized administration that left little room for Ivorian participation in policymaking. The French colonial administration also adopted divide-and-rule policies, applying ideas of assimilation only to the educated elite. The French were interested in ensuring that the small but influential elite was sufficiently satisfied with the status quo to refrain from any anti-French sentiment. Although strongly opposed to the practices of association, educated Ivorians believed that they would achieve equality with their French peers through assimilation rather than through complete independence from France, a change that would eliminate the enormous economic advantages of remaining a French possession. After postwar reforms, the Ivorian leaders realized that assimilation implied the superiority of the French over the Ivorians and that discrimination and inequality would end only with independence.

==Independence==

As early as 1944, Charles de Gaulle proposed to change France&#x27;s politics and take &quot;the road of a new era.&quot; In 1946, the French Empire was converted into the French Union which was superseded by the French Community in 1958. In December 1958, Ivory Coast became an autonomous republic within the French Community as a result of a referendum on 7 August that brought community status to all members of the old Federation of French West Africa (except Guinea, which had voted against the association). On 11 July 1960, France agreed to Ivory Coast becoming fully independent. Ivory Coast became independent on 7 August 1960, and permitted its community members to lapse. It established the commercial city Abidjan as its capital.

Ivory Coast&#x27;s contemporary political history is closely associated with the career of Félix Houphouët-Boigny, president of the republic and leader of the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast (PDCI) until his death on 7 December 1993. He was one of the founders of the Rassemblement Démocratique Africain (RDA), the leading pre-independence inter-territorial political party for all of the French West African territories except Mauritania.

Houphouët-Boigny first came to political prominence in 1944 as the founder of the African Agricultural Union, an organization that won improved conditions for African farmers and formed a nucleus for the PDCI. After World War II, he was elected by a narrow margin to the first Constituent Assembly. Representing Ivory Coast in the French National Assembly from 1946 to 1959, he devoted much of his effort to inter-territorial political organization and further amelioration of labor conditions. After his thirteen years in the French National Assembly, including almost three years as a minister in the French Government, he became Ivory Coast&#x27;s first prime minister in April 1959, and the following year was elected its first president.

In May 1959, Houphouët-Boigny reinforced his position as a dominant figure in West Africa by leading Ivory Coast, Niger, Upper Volta (Burkina Faso), and Dahomey (Benin) into the Council of the Entente, a regional organization promoting economic development. He maintained that the road to African solidarity was through step-by-step economic and political cooperation, recognizing the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other African states.

Houphouët-Boigny was considerably more conservative than most African leaders of the post-colonial period, maintaining close ties to the West and rejecting the leftist and anti-western stance of many leaders at the time. This contributed to the country&#x27;s economic and political stability. The first multiparty presidential elections were held in October 1990 and Houphouët-Boigny won convincingly. He died on 7 December 1993.

==After Houphouët-Boigny==
Houphouët-Boigny was succeeded by his deputy Henri Konan Bédié, President of the Parliament. Konan Bédié was 24 December 1999, during the 1999 Ivorian coup d&#x27;état by General Robert Guéï, a former army commander who was dismissed by Bédié. This was the first &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in the history of Ivory Coast. An economic downturn followed and the junta promised to return the country to democratic rule in 2000.

Guéï allowed elections to be held the following year. When he lost the election to Laurent Gbagbo, Gué at first refused to accept his defeat. However, street protests forced him to step down, and Gbagbo became president on 26 October 2000.

==First Civil War==
On 19 September 2002, a rebellion in the north and the west of Ivory Coast flared up and the country was divided into three parts. Mass murders occurred, notably in Abidjan from 25 to 27 March, when government forces killed more than 200 protesters, and on 20 and 21 June in Bouaké and Korhogo, where purges led to the execution of more than 100 people. In 2002, France sent troops to Ivory Coast as peacekeepers. A reconciliation process under international auspices started in 2003. In February 2004, the United Nations established the United Nations Operation in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (UNOCI)

Disarmament was supposed to take place on 15 October 2004, but was a failure. Tensions between Ivory Coast and France increased on 6 November 2004, after Ivorian air strikes killed 9 French peacekeepers and an aid worker. In response, French forces attacked the airport at Yamoussoukro, destroying all airplanes in the Ivorian Air Force. Violent protests erupted in both Abidjan and Yamoussoukro and were marked by violence between Ivorians and French peacekeepers. Thousands of foreigners, especially French nationals, evacuated the two cities. Most of the fighting ended by late 2004, with the country, split between a rebel-held north under the leadership of Guillaume Soro and a government-held south under the leadership of Laurent Gbagbo.

Under this system, the quality of life dropped overall, with an increase in debt and civil unrest. To answer these problems, the concept of &quot;ivoirité&quot; was born, a racist term targeted denying political and economic rights to the Northern immigrants. In March 2007 the two sides signed an agreement to hold fresh elections. However, the elections were delayed until 2010, five years after Gbagbo&#x27;s term of office expired.

==Second Civil War==

After northern candidate Alassane Ouattara was declared the victor of the 2010 Ivorian presidential election by the country&#x27;s Independent Electoral Commission (CEI), the President of the Constitutional Council and an ally of Gbagbo, declared the results to be invalid and that Gbagbo was the winner. Both Gbagbo and Ouattara claimed victory and took the presidential oath of office. The international community, including the United Nations, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the European Union, the United States, and former colonial power France affirmed their support for Ouattara and called for Gbagbo to step down. However, negotiations to resolve the dispute failed to achieve any satisfactory outcome. Hundreds of people died in escalating violence between pro-Gbagbo and pro-Ouattara partisans and at least a million people fled, mostly from Abidjan.

International organizations reported numerous instances of human rights violations by both sides, particularly in Duékoué. The United Nations and French forces took military action to protect their forces and civilians. Ouattara&#x27;s forces arrested Gbagbo at his residence on 11 April 2011.

== After the 2011 Civil War ==

Alassane Ouattara has ruled Ivory Coast since 2010, when he unseated his predecessor Laurent Gbagbo. Ouattara was re-elected in 2015 presidential election. In November 2020, he won a third term in the 2020 presidential election. His opponents boycotted the election, arguing that a third term was illegal. Ivory Coast&#x27;s Constitutional Council formally ratified Ouattara&#x27;s re-election to a third term in November 2020.

<text>The Gulf of Guinea (French: &quot;Golfe de Guinée&quot;; Spanish: &quot;Golfo de Guinea&quot;; Portuguese: &quot;Golfo da Guiné&quot;) is the northeasternmost part of the tropical Atlantic Ocean from Cape Lopez in Gabon, north and west to Cape Palmas in Liberia. Null Island, defined as the intersection of the Equator and Prime Meridian (zero degrees latitude and longitude), is in the gulf.

Among the many rivers that drain into the Gulf of Guinea are the Niger and the Volta. The coastline on the gulf includes the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Bonny.

==Name==
&quot;Guinea&quot; is thought to have originated from a local name for an area in the region, although the specifics are disputed. Bovill (1995) gives a thorough description:

The name &quot;Guinea&quot; was also previously applied to the south coast of West Africa (north of the Gulf of Guinea), which became known as &quot;Upper Guinea&quot;, and to the west coast of Southern Africa (to the east), which became known as &quot;Lower Guinea&quot;.

Today, the word &quot;Guinea&quot; is found in the names of three countries in Africa (Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Equatorial Guinea), and in one country in Melanesia (Papua New Guinea).

==Geography==
The main river dispensing its waters in the gulf is the Niger River.

Different definitions of the geographic limits of the Gulf of Guinea are given; the International Hydrographic Organization defines the southwest extent of the Gulf of Guinea as &quot;B line from Cap Lopez (), in Gabon, northwestward to Ihléu Gago Coutinho (Ilhéu das Rôlas) (); and thence a line from Ihléu Gago Coutinho northwestward to Cape Palmas (), in Liberia.

===Islands in the Gulf of Guinea===
The Gulf of Guinea contains a number of islands, the largest of which are in a southwest-northeast chain, forming part of the Cameroon line of volcanoes.

Annobón, also known as Pagalu or Pigalua, is an island that is part of Equatorial Guinea.

Bobowasi Island is an island off the west coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea that is part of the Western Region of Ghana.

Bioko is an island off the Ambazonian region of Cameroon in the Gulf of Guinea under the sovereignty of Equatorial Guinea.

Corisco is an island belonging to Equatorial Guinea.

Elobey Grande and Elobey Chico are two small islands belonging to Equatorial Guinea.

São Tomé and Príncipe (officially the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe) is a Portuguese-speaking island nation in the Gulf of Guinea that became independent from Portugal in 1975. It is located off the western equatorial coast of Africa and consists of two islands, São Tomé and Príncipe. They are located about apart and about , respectively, off the northwestern coast of Gabon. Both islands are part of an extinct volcanic mountain range. São Tomé, the sizeable southern island, is situated just north of the Equator.

== Maritime security ==
Maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea consists of 18 sovereign states. Where most of the maritime security issues in the Gulf of Guinea have terrible consequences for the shipping industry.

Multiple institutional mandates address maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea: the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS). Additionally, maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea is also addressed by the Gulf of Guinea Commission (GGC). 

There has been a 60% population growth in the Gulf of Guinea since 2000, which consequently leads people to resort to hijacking, kidnapping, robberies, and more due to food shortages. 

Climate change has become a huge problem in the Gulf of Guinea and as a consequence has different Maritime security issues become more pressing. These maritime security crimes are characterized not only by piracy but by a myriad of maritime crimes despite piracy often dominating the conversation on maritime security. The other notable crimes in the Gulf of Guinea are illegal fishing, kidnapping for ransom, drug trafficking, and oil-bunkering. Illegal oil-bunkering consists of the attacking of vessels transporting oil and transferring the oil to the thieves’ own vessel, after which the oil is sold in local and international markets. Illegal oil bunkering at sea is mainly prevalent in the Nigerian waters. 

Kidnapping for ransom is also one of the most prevalent maritime crimes in the region. Between 2018 and 2019, the number of crew members that were kidnapped in the Gulf of Guinea increased by 50%, leading the region to account for 90% of global kidnappings at sea. About 92% of the hostage-taking and 73% of kidnappings happening in and around Africa are happening in the Gulf of Guinea. There is also a large issue of drug trafficking in the Gulf of Guinea and the region has over the last few years become a haven for drug trafficking mainly from South America into Europe.

=== Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing ===

IUU fishing also known as Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has become a severe problem in the Gulf of Guinea. In 2000 were there reports of 212,800 tons of fish caught and in 2012, this number increased by 9 percent to 232,200 tons.
IUU consequently creates spillover problems to the social, economic, and environmental life in the Gulf of Guinea. It presents a direct threat to the national security of the coastal states in the Gulf of Guinea. IUU has been linked to multiple issues and forms of organized crime. Some of these crimes are arms trafficking, drug smuggling, forced labor, piracy and more.

IUU depletes fish stocks in the area and causes issues for fishermen and the local population food security. One of the main issues of IUU is that a lot of the fish that is caught in the Gulf of Guinea is fish that is unreported when caught. This causes overfishing and overfishing causes depleting fisheries all around the region. IUU fishing also becomes a severe issue in the region because it allows fishermen to fish in vessels that are not nationally regulated or managed. Furthermore, can these vessels threaten people&#x27;s human security due to poor working conditions and poorly regulated boats? Many of the IUU fishing boats are old, rusty, and often in poor condition. 

Both small-scale and large-scale fisheries often do illegal fishing in the Gulf of Guinea 
In the Gulf of Guinea can we see severe blue crime spillover effects of IUU through both piracy and human trafficking. Economic activity in the Gulf of Guinea has given rise to maritime piracy in the region. It is evident that in the Gulf of Guinea is there more piracy, forced labor and human trafficking as a consequence of IUU fishing, depleting fish stock and large competition of resources and food.

=== Further Blue Crime Consequences of IUU === 

There have been many reports of forced labor at sea in the Gulf of Guinea on illegal fishing boats. The EJF reports that through their studies they found that some fishermen and immigrant workers have been forced to work on fishing boats in the Gulf of Guinea for months at a time without access to land. Some of these workers were deployed to sea each day in canoes and in the night where they were forced to return to the mother ship to unload fish. Many illegal fishing boats have operated like such for many years and the workers are often contracted for two years at a time, with no chance to visit home or at times even land in general. 

Many workers are paid in boxes of what the EJF called &quot;trash fish&quot; -caught as by-catch- and then the way they would earn money was to further sell this fish. Other reports of forced labor on illegal fishing boats report poor and non-existent safety equipment. Little to no hygiene standards, poor accommodation standards, and very little food. 

Even though piracy in the Gulf of Guinea has dropped since its peak in 2020, is it still a pressing issue in the region. Many pirate groups in the Gulf of Guinea often recruit unemployed and underemployed fishermen. This has become highly lucrative due to poor wages and little to no money going around. Often have these local fishermen been lured into the prospect of quick easy money and as a result sold their fishing boats to other pirates in the Gulf. Depliting fishing stocks encourages fishermen to engage in piracy and more violence in the region is occurring.

<text>The Volta River (, , ) is the main river system in the West African country of Ghana. It flows south into Ghana from the Bobo-Dioulasso highlands of Burkina Faso. 

The three main parts of the river are the Black Volta, the White Volta, and the Red Volta. In the northwest, the Black Volta forms the international borders of the Ivory Coast, Ghana, and Burkina Faso. The Volta flows southward along the Akwapim-Togoland highlands, and empties into the Atlantic Ocean at the Gulf of Guinea at Ada Foah. One of its smaller tributaries, the Oti River, enters Ghana from Togo in the east. The Volta River has been dammed at Akosombo for generating hydroelectricity. The reservoir named Lake Volta stretches from Akosombo Dam in the south to the northern part of the country, and is the largest man-made reservoir by area in the world.

The country of Burkina Faso was formerly called Upper Volta, after the river.
==The reservoir==
Lake Volta is a reservoir impounded by the Akosombo Dam on the lower Volta River in southern Ghana. It is one of the largest reservoirs in the world. It extends from the Akosombo Dam in southeastern Ghana to the town of Yapei in the Central Gonja District, Northern Region of Ghana, some to the north.

The dam&#x27;s power plant generates electricity for the Volta River Authority, and the reservoir also provides water transport routes. It is a resource for irrigation and fish farming.

The depth of the river is about below Lake Volta. The Volta River is crossed by the Adome Bridge just below the Akosombo Dam.

==History==
The Akwamu people who once built a kingdom on both the east and west banks of the river spanning present day Ghana, Togo and Benin call it Firaw. They have a deity dedicated to the river named Mfodwo.

The Volta River was named by Portuguese gold traders in Ghana. It was their farthest extent of exploration before returning (&quot;volta&quot; is Portuguese for &quot;twist&quot; or &quot;turn&quot;). It has been known as the &quot;River of return&quot; (perhaps because it was where ships turned around and headed for home) or &quot;river of the bend&quot;, in reference to its curved course.

<doc id="42551" wikidata="Q16386896" url="?curid=42551" title="Marty (The Philco Television Playhouse)">
<text>&quot;Marty&quot; is a 1953 television play by Paddy Chayefsky. It was telecast live May 24, 1953, on &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot; with Rod Steiger in the title role and Nancy Marchand, in her television debut, playing opposite him as Clara. Chayefsky&#x27;s story of a decent, hard-working Bronx butcher, pining for the company of a woman in his life but despairing of ever finding true love in a relationship, was produced by Fred Coe with associate producer Gordon Duff.

The teleplay was adapted into the feature film &quot;Marty&quot; starring Ernest Borgnine in 1955. It was directed by Delbert Mann and written by Chayefsky.

==Development==
In his collected &quot;Television Plays&quot; (1955), Chayefsky recalled:
:I set out in &quot;Marty&quot; to write a love story, the most ordinary love story in the world. I didn&#x27;t want my hero to be handsome, and I didn&#x27;t want the girl to be pretty. I wanted to write a love story the way it would literally have happened to the kind of people I know... The actor who played Marty, Rod Steiger, is one of the most gifted young actors in the theater, and I owe him a genuine debt of gratitude for all that he contributed to this show.

The story originated by chance when Delbert Mann and Chayefsky were rehearsing &quot;The Reluctant Citizen&quot; in the old Abbey Hotel&#x27;s ballroom on West 51st Street, which was also used for Friday night meetings of the Friendship Club. After Chayefsky wandered around and spotted a sign which read, &quot;Girls, Dance With the Man Who Asks You. Remember, Men Have Feelings, Too&quot;, he told Mann he thought there was a play possibility about a young woman in that type of setting. Speaking to Mann later that day, he told him that such a drama could work better with a man as the central character rather than a woman. Mann told him to go talk to Fred Coe, which Chayefsky did. He pitched the idea by simply saying, &quot;I want to do a play about a guy who goes to a ballroom.&quot; Coe told him to start writing it.

As Chayefsky was in the middle of writing the script (at this point entitled &quot;Love Story&quot;), Coe and Mann unexpectedly rejected another script that was scheduled for production. Coe then called Chayefsky to ask him how the &quot;Love Story&quot; script was going, hoping that it could be put into production immediately. At that point, Chayefsky was partway through act 2, and thought he could have it finished in a few weeks, but after talking with Coe he agreed to turn around material in only a few days.

The piece was cast and rehearsals got underway with only acts 1 &amp; 2 having been delivered. Chayefsky delivered Act 3 one day later than expected, but still in time to give the cast and crew several days of rehearsal with the complete teleplay.

Chayefsky&#x27;s original title &quot;Love Story&quot; was deemed unacceptable by NBC, who requested the title be changed. Chayefsky&#x27;s alternative title of &quot;Marty&quot; was used instead.

==Reception==
Tony Schwartz reviewed the television production in &quot;The New York Times&quot;:
The acclaimed television drama was honored a decade later when the kinescope of the production was selected for showing at the Museum of Modern Art on February 17–20, 1963, as part of &quot;Television USA: Thirteen Seasons&quot;, described by MoMA Film Library curator Richard Griffith as &quot;a grand retrospective of the best that has been done in American television.&quot;

It was released on VHS by Wood Knapp Video.

The original 1953 telecast is commercially available as part of a three-DVD set, &quot;The Golden Age of Television&quot; (Criterion Collection), a series which aired on PBS in 1981 with Eva Marie Saint as the host of &quot;Marty&quot;. It features interviews with Steiger, Marchand and Mann.

Only Esther Minciotti, Augusta Ciolli and Joe Mantell repeated their 1953 TV drama roles in the 1955 film adaptation.

<text>DATR is a language for lexical knowledge representation. The lexical knowledge is encoded in a network of nodes. Each node has a set of attributes encoded with it. A node can represent a word or a word form.

DATR was developed in the late 1980s by Roger Evans, Gerald Gazdar and Bill Keller, and used extensively in the 1990s; the standard specification is contained in the Evans and Gazdar RFC, available on the Sussex website (below). DATR has been implemented in a variety of programming languages, and several implementations are available on the internet, including an RFC compliant implementation at the Bielefeld website (below).

DATR is still used for encoding inheritance networks in various linguistic and non-linguistic domains and is under discussion as a standard notation for the representation of lexical information.

<doc id="42555" wikidata="Q1079270" url="?curid=42555" title="Jig">
<text>The jig (, ) is a form of lively folk dance in compound metre, as well as the accompanying dance tune. It first gained popularity in 16th-century England, Ireland, Scotland, and other parts of the British Isles, and was adopted on mainland Europe where it eventually became the final movement of the mature Baroque dance suite (the French gigue; Italian and Spanish giga). Today it is most associated with Irish dance music, Scottish country dance, French Canadian traditionnal music and dance (trad) and the Métis people in Canada. Jigs were originally in quadruple compound metre, (e.g., time), but have been adapted to a variety of time signatures, by which they are often classified into groups, including double jigs (), slip jigs () and single jigs ().

==Origins==
The term &quot;jig&quot; was probably derived from the French &quot;giguer&quot;, meaning &#x27;to jump&#x27; or the Italian &quot;giga&quot;. The use of &#x27;jig&#x27; in Irish dance derives from the Irish &quot;jigeánnai&quot;, itself borrowed from the Old English &quot;giga&quot; meaning &#x27;old dance&#x27;. It was known as a dance in 16th-century England, often in time, and the term was used for a post-play entertainment featuring dance in early modern England, but which &#x27;probably employed a great variety
of dances, solo (suitable for jigs), paired, round, country or courtly&#x27;; in Playford&#x27;s &quot;Dancing Master&quot; (1651) &#x27;the dance game in &quot;Kemps Jegg&quot; is a typical scenario from a dramatic jig and it is likely that the combination of dance metre for steps and non-metrical passages for pantomime indicates how a solo or ensemble jig might have been danced by stage players.&#x27; Later the dance began to be associated with music particularly in time, and with slip jigs time.

==Ireland and Scotland==
During the middle of the 16th century the dance was adopted in Ireland and in the 17th century Scotland, where it was widely adapted, and the jig is now most often associated with these countries, especially Ireland. The jig is second in popularity only to the reel in traditional Irish dance; it is popular but somewhat less common in Scottish country dance music. It is transcribed in compound metre, being time. The most common structure of a jig is two eight-bar parts, performing two different steps, each once on the right foot, and one on the left foot. As with most other types of dance tunes in Irish music, at a session or a dance it is common for two or more jigs to be strung together in a set, flowing on without interruption.

==In Irish step dance==

The following distinction is primarily observed in modern competitive Irish dance and should not be confused with the general notion of how the jigs are played and classified among traditional Irish musicians.

===Light jigs===
A light jig is the second-fastest of all jigs. The performer&#x27;s feet rarely leave the ground for long, as the step is fast, typically performed at a speed around 116 at feiseanna. There are several light jig steps, varying with each dance school, but the rising step, or the rise and grind, is standard in almost all light jigs. The right side version of the rising step is performed by putting weight on the left foot, lifting the right foot off the ground then hopping on the left foot once. Hop on the left foot again, bringing the right foot back behind the left foot and then shift the weight onto the right foot, leaving the left foot in the air. Dancers use the phrase &quot;hop, hop back&quot; for these three movements, and there is a slight pause between the hop, and hop back. The next movement is a hop on the right foot. Then shift the weight, left-right-left-right. The phrase for this whole movement is: &quot;hop, hop back, hop back 2-3.&quot; To do the step on the left foot, reverse the left and right directions.

===Slip jigs===
Slip jigs are in time. Because of the longer measures, they are longer than the reel and the light jig, with the same number of bars to the music. The dance is performed high on the toes, and is often considered the &quot;ballet of Irish dance&quot; because of its graceful movements that seem to slip the performers across the floor. Slip jigs are performed at a speed of 113 bpm at feiseanna.

===Single and double jigs===

Single jigs should not be confused with slides; they are the least common of the jigs, performed in ghillies, in a or less commonly a time. Musically, the single jig tends to follow the pattern of a quarter note followed by an eighth note (twice per bar), whereas the pattern for the double jig is three eighth notes twice per bar.

===Hop jigs===
Hop jigs are the fastest of all jigs next to light jigs, but the term &quot;hop jig&quot; causes some confusion, as some people use it for a single jig, while others use this term to refer to a tune in time.

Among the latter, some do not distinguish it from a slip jig, while some reserve the term to a slip jig variant that has special characteristics, in particular an emphasis on quarter note–eighth note pairs.

===Treble jigs===
Treble jigs (also called the hard or heavy jig) are performed in hard shoes, and also to a time metre. They are characterized by stomps, trebles, and clicks. Many set dances are performed in treble jig time, a few being Drunken Gauger, Blackthorn Stick, The Three Sea Captains, and St Patrick&#x27;s Day. Two types of treble jigs are performed at feiseanna: the traditional and non-traditional (slow) treble jigs. Beginners will do a treble jig at traditional speed (92 bpm), while more advanced dancers will dance the non-traditional (slow) treble jig at 72 bpm.

==Straight and sand jigs==
In 19th-century America, the jig was the name adopted for a form of step dancing developed by enslaved African-Americans and later adopted by minstrel show performers. Danced to five-string banjo or fiddle tunes in or metre played at schottische tempo, the minstrel jig (also called the &quot;straight jig&quot; to distinguish it from Irish dances) was characterized by syncopated rhythm and eccentric movements. Jig dancers employed a repertoire of &quot;hits&quot; on the heel or toe, &quot;hops&quot; on one foot, &quot;springs&quot; off both feet as well as various slides and shuffles. The most famous early jig dancer was Master Juba, an African-American who inspired a host of white imitators, many of whom performed in blackface. John Diamond, an Irish-American who competed with Master Juba in a series of &quot;challenge dances&quot;, was among the most prominent of these white minstrel jig dancers. Minstrel jigs, as well as clogs and breakdowns, were crucial to the evolution of 20th-century tap and soft-shoe dancing.

A variant of the straight jig was the &quot;sand jig&quot; or &quot;sand dance&quot;, performed as a series of shuffles and slides on a sand-strewn stage. The most prominent sand jiggers of the 19th century were two women, both born in New York in 1855: Buffalo native Kitty O&#x27;Neil and her Manhattan-born rival Kitty Sharpe. Sand dancing was a staple of minstrelsy, variety and vaudeville, and was kept alive in later decades largely by African-American tap dancers, including John Bubbles, Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson, Sammy Davis Jr., Harriet Browne and, most prominently, Howard &quot;Sandman&quot; Sims.

<text>Estrid of the [[Obotrites]] ( 979 – 1035) was Queen of Sweden in the Viking age, a West Slavic princess married to the King of Sweden, Olof Skötkonung c. 1000–1022. She was the mother of King Anund Jacob of Sweden and the Kievan Rus&#x27; saint and grand princess Ingegerd Olofsdotter.

==Biography==

Legend says that Estrid was possibly taken back to Sweden from a war in the West Slavic area of Mecklenburg, potentially as a war-prize. She was most likely given by her father, a tribal chief of the Polabian Obotrites, as a peace offering in a marriage to seal the peace, and she is thought to have brought with her a great dowry, as a great Slavic influence is represented in Sweden from her time, mainly among craftsmen.

Her husband also had a mistress, Edla, who came from the same area in Europe as herself, and who was possibly taken to Sweden at the same time. The king treated Edla and Estrid the same way and gave his son and his two daughters with Edla the same privileges as the children he had with Estrid, though it was Estrid he married and made queen.

Queen Estrid was baptised with her husband, their children and large numbers of the Swedish royal court in 1008, when the Swedish royal family converted to Christianity, although the king promised to respect the freedom of religion - Sweden was not to be Christian until the last religious war between Inge the Elder and Blot-Sweyn of 1084–1088.

Snorre Sturlasson wrote about her, that Estrid was unkind to the children (Emund, Astrid and Holmfrid) of her husband&#x27;s mistress Edla; 
:&quot; Queen Estrid was arrogant and not kind towards her stepchildren, and therefore the king sent his son Emund to Vendland, where he was brought up by his maternal relatives&quot;. 

Not much more is known of Estrid as a person. Snorre Sturlasson mentions her as a lover of pomp and luxury, and as hard and strict towards her servants.

==Children==
* Ingegerd Olofsdotter (c. 1001-1054), Grand Princess of Kiev, in Kievan Rus&#x27; called Anna, married Yaroslav I the Wise, prince of Novgorod and Kiev.
* Anund Jacob (c. 1010-1050), king of Sweden, succeeded Olof as king in c. 1022.

<doc id="42558" wikidata="Q35314" url="?curid=42558" title="Nikita Khrushchev">
<text>Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev (– 11 September 1971) was First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964, and Chairman of the Council of Ministers (premier) from 1958 to 1964. During his rule, Khrushchev stunned the communist world with his denunciation of his predecessor Joseph Stalin and embarked on a policy of de-Stalinization with his key ally Anastas Mikoyan. He sponsored the early Soviet space program and enacted reforms in domestic policy. After some false starts, and a narrowly avoided nuclear war over Cuba, he conducted successful negotiations with the United States to reduce Cold War tensions. In 1964, the Kremlin circle stripped him of power, replacing him with Leonid Brezhnev as First Secretary and Alexei Kosygin as Premier.

Khrushchev was born in 1894 in a village in western Russia. He was employed as a metal worker during his youth, and he was a political commissar during the Russian Civil War. Under the sponsorship of Lazar Kaganovich, Khrushchev worked his way up the Soviet hierarchy. He originally supported Stalin&#x27;s purges and approved thousands of arrests. In 1938, Stalin sent him to govern the Ukrainian SSR, and he continued the purges there. During what was known as the Great Patriotic War, Khrushchev was again a commissar, serving as an intermediary between Stalin and his generals. Khrushchev was present at the defense of Stalingrad, a fact he took great pride in. After the war, he returned to Ukraine before being recalled to Moscow as one of Stalin&#x27;s close advisers.

On 5 March 1953, Stalin&#x27;s death triggered a power struggle in which Khrushchev emerged victorious upon consolidating his authority as First Secretary of the party&#x27;s Central Committee. On 25 February 1956, at the 20th Party Congress, he delivered the &quot;Secret Speech&quot;, which denounced Stalin&#x27;s purges and ushered in a less repressive era in the Soviet Union. His domestic policies, aimed at bettering the lives of ordinary citizens, were often ineffective, especially in agriculture. Hoping eventually to rely on missiles for national defense, Khrushchev ordered major cuts in conventional forces. Despite the cuts, Khrushchev&#x27;s time in office saw the tensest years of the Cold War, culminating in the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.

As leader of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev enjoyed considerable popularity throughout the 1950s due to the successful launching of Sputnik and victorious outcomes in the Suez Crisis, the Syrian Crisis of 1957, and the 1960 U-2 incident. By the early 1960s, however, support for Khrushchev&#x27;s leadership was significantly eroded by domestic policy failures and his mishandling of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Such developments emboldened his political rivals who quietly rose in strength and ultimately deposed him in October 1964. However, he did not suffer the deadly fate of the losers of previous Soviet power struggles and was pensioned off with an apartment in Moscow and a dacha in the countryside. His lengthy memoirs were smuggled to the West and published in part in 1970. Khrushchev died from a heart attack in 1971.

== Early years ==
Khrushchev was born on 15 April 1894, in Kalinovka, a village in what is now Russia&#x27;s Kursk Oblast (then Kursk Governorate), near the present Ukrainian border. His parents, Sergei Khrushchev and Kseniya Khrushcheva, were poor Russian peasants, and had a daughter two years Nikita&#x27;s junior, Irina. Sergei Khrushchev was employed in a number of positions in the Donbas area of far eastern Ukraine, working as a railwayman, as a miner, and laboring in a brick factory. Wages were much higher in the Donbas than in the Kursk region, and Sergei Khrushchev generally left his family in Kalinovka, returning when he had enough money. When Nikita was six or seven, the family moved to Yuzovka (now Donetsk, Ukraine) for about a year before returning to Kalinovka.

Kalinovka was a peasant village; Khrushchev&#x27;s teacher, Lydia Shevchenko, later stated that she had never seen a village as poor. Nikita worked as a herdsboy from an early age. He was schooled for a total of four years, part in the village school and part under Shevchenko&#x27;s tutelage in Kalinovka&#x27;s state school. According to Khrushchev&#x27;s memoirs, Shevchenko was a freethinker who upset the villagers by not attending church, and when her brother visited, she gave Khrushchev books which had been banned by the Imperial Government. She urged Nikita to seek further education, but family finances did not permit this.

In 1908, Sergei Khrushchev moved to the Donbas city of Yuzovka; fourteen-year-old Nikita followed later that year, while Kseniya Khrushcheva and her daughter came after. Yuzovka, which was renamed Stalino in 1924 and Donetsk in 1961, was at the heart of one of the most industrialized areas of the Russian Empire. After working briefly in other fields, Khrushchev&#x27;s parents found Nikita a place as a metal fitter&#x27;s apprentice. Upon completing that apprenticeship, the teenage Khrushchev was hired by a factory. He lost that job when he collected money for the families of the victims of the Lena Goldfields massacre, and was hired to mend underground equipment by a mine in nearby Ruchenkovo, where his father was the union organizer, and he helped distribute copies and organize public readings of &quot;Pravda&quot;. He later stated that he considered emigrating to the United States for better wages, but did not do so. He later recalled his working days:
When World War I broke out in 1914, Khrushchev was exempt from conscription because he was a skilled metal worker. He was employed by a workshop that serviced ten mines, and he was involved in several strikes that demanded higher pay, better working conditions, and an end to the war. In 1914, he married Yefrosinia Pisareva, daughter of the lift operator at the Rutchenkovo mine. In 1915, they had a daughter, Yulia, and in 1917, a son, Leonid.

After the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II in 1917, the new Russian Provisional Government in Petrograd had little influence over Ukraine. Khrushchev was elected to the worker&#x27;s council (or &quot;soviet&quot;) in Rutchenkovo, and in May he became its chairman. He did not join the Bolsheviks until 1918, a year in which the Russian Civil War, between the Bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the White Army, began in earnest. His biographer, William Taubman, suggests that Khrushchev&#x27;s delay in affiliating himself with the Bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the Mensheviks who prioritized economic progress, whereas the Bolsheviks sought political power. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups, and it was difficult to keep them all straight.

In March 1918, as the Bolshevik government concluded a separate peace with the Central Powers, the Germans occupied the Donbas and Khrushchev fled to Kalinovka. In late 1918 or early 1919, he was mobilized into the Red Army as a political commissar. The post of political commissar had recently been introduced as the Bolsheviks came to rely less on worker activists and more on military recruits; its functions included indoctrination of recruits in the tenets of Bolshevism, and promoting troop morale and battle readiness. Beginning as commissar to a construction platoon, Khrushchev rose to become commissar to a construction battalion and was sent from the front for a two-month political course. The young commissar came under fire many times, though many of the war stories he would tell in later life dealt more with cultural awkwardness rather than combat. In 1921, the civil war ended, and Khrushchev was demobilized and assigned as commissar to a labor brigade in the Donbas, where he and his men lived in poor conditions.

The wars had caused widespread devastation and famine, and one of the victims was Khrushchev&#x27;s wife, Yefrosinia, who died of typhus in Kalinovka while Khrushchev was in the army. The commissar returned for the funeral and, loyal to his Bolshevik principles, refused to allow his wife&#x27;s coffin to enter the local church. With the only way into the churchyard through the church, he had the coffin lifted and passed over the fence into the burial ground, shocking the village.

== Party official ==
=== Donbass years ===

Through the intervention of a friend, Khrushchev was assigned in 1921 as assistant director for political affairs for the Rutchenkovo mine in the Donbas region, where he had previously worked. There were as yet few Bolsheviks in the area. At that time, the movement was split by Lenin&#x27;s New Economic Policy. While Khrushchev&#x27;s responsibility lay in political affairs, he involved himself in the practicalities of resuming full production at the mine after the chaos of the war years. He helped restart the machines (key parts and papers had been removed by the pre-Soviet mine-owners) and he wore his old mine outfit for inspection tours.

Khrushchev was highly successful at the Rutchenkovo mine, and in mid-1922 he was offered the directorship of the nearby Pastukhov mine. However, he refused the offer, seeking to be assigned to the newly established technical college (&quot;tekhnikum&quot;) in Yuzovka, though his superiors were reluctant to let him go. As he had only four years of formal schooling, he applied to the training program (&quot;rabfak&quot;, short for Рабочий факультет / Rabotchyi Fakultyet, or Worker&#x27;s Faculty) attached to the &quot;tekhnikum&quot; that was designed to bring undereducated students to high-school level, a prerequisite for entry into the &quot;tekhnikum&quot;. While enrolled in the &quot;rabfak&quot;, Khrushchev continued his work at the Rutchenkovo mine.
One of his teachers later described him as a poor student. He was more successful in advancing in the Communist Party; soon after his admission to the &quot;rabfak&quot; in August 1922, he was appointed party secretary of the entire &quot;tekhnikum&quot;, and became a member of the bureau—the governing council—of the party committee for the town of Yuzovka (renamed Stalino in 1924). He briefly joined supporters of Leon Trotsky against those of Joseph Stalin over the question of party democracy. All of these activities left him with little time for his schoolwork, and while he later said he had finished his &quot;rabfak&quot; studies, it is unclear whether this was true.

According to William Taubman, Khrushchev&#x27;s studies were aided by Nina Petrovna Kukharchuk, a well-educated Party organizer and daughter of well-to-do Ukrainian peasants. The family was poor, according to Nina&#x27;s own recollections. The two lived together as husband and wife for the rest of Khrushchev&#x27;s life, though they never registered their marriage. They had three children together: daughter Rada was born in 1929, son Sergei in 1935 and daughter Elena in 1937.

In mid-1925, Khrushchev was appointed Party secretary of the Petrovo-Marinsky &quot;raikom&quot;, or district, near Stalino. The &quot;raikom&quot; was about in area, and Khrushchev was constantly on the move throughout his domain, taking an interest in even minor matters. In late 1925, Khrushchev was elected a non-voting delegate to the 14th Congress of the USSR Communist Party in Moscow.

=== Kaganovich protégé ===

Khrushchev met Lazar Kaganovich as early as 1917. In 1925, Kaganovich became Party head in Ukraine and Khrushchev, falling under his patronage, was rapidly promoted. He was appointed second in command of Stalin&#x27;s party apparatus in late 1926. Within nine months his superior, Konstantin Moiseyenko, was ousted, which, according to Taubman, was due to Khrushchev&#x27;s instigation. Kaganovich transferred Khrushchev to Kharkov, then the capital of Ukraine, as head of the Organizational Department of the Ukrainian Party&#x27;s Central Committee. In 1928, Khrushchev was transferred to Kiev, where he served as head of the organizational department, second-in-command of the Party organization there.

In 1929, Khrushchev again sought to further his education, following Kaganovich (now in the Kremlin as a close associate of Stalin) to Moscow and enrolling in the Stalin Industrial Academy. Khrushchev never completed his studies there, but his career in the Party flourished. When the school&#x27;s Party cell elected a number of rightists to an upcoming district Party conference, the cell was attacked in &quot;Pravda&quot;. Khrushchev emerged victorious in the ensuing power struggle, becoming Party secretary of the school, arranging for the delegates to be withdrawn, and, afterward, purging the cell of the rightists. Khrushchev rose rapidly through the Party ranks, first becoming Party leader for the Bauman district, site of the academy, before taking the same position in the Krasnopresnensky district, the capital&#x27;s largest and most important. By 1932, Khrushchev had become second in command, behind Kaganovich, of the Moscow city Party organization, and in 1934, he became Party leader for the city and a member of the Party&#x27;s Central Committee. Khrushchev attributed his rapid rise to his acquaintance with fellow Academy student Nadezhda Alliluyeva, Stalin&#x27;s wife. In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that Alliluyeva spoke well of him to her husband. His biographer, William Tompson, downplays the possibility, stating that Khrushchev was too low in the Party hierarchy to enjoy Stalin&#x27;s patronage and that if influence was brought to bear on Khrushchev&#x27;s career at this stage, it was by Kaganovich.

While head of the Moscow city organization, Khrushchev superintended the construction of the Moscow Metro, a highly expensive undertaking, with Kaganovich in overall charge. Faced with an already-announced opening date of 7 November 1934, Khrushchev took considerable risks in the construction and spent much of his time down in the tunnels. When the inevitable accidents did occur, they were depicted as heroic sacrifices in a great cause. The Metro did not open until 1 May 1935, but Khrushchev received the Order of Lenin for his role in its construction. Later that year, he was selected as First Secretary of the Moscow Regional Committee which was responsible for Moscow &quot;oblast&quot;, a province with a population of 11 million.

=== Involvement in purges ===

Stalin&#x27;s office records show meetings at which Khrushchev was present as early as 1932. The two increasingly built a good relationship. Khrushchev greatly admired the dictator and treasured informal meetings with him and invitations to Stalin&#x27;s &quot;dacha&quot;, while Stalin felt warm affection for his young subordinate. Beginning in 1934, Stalin began a campaign of political repression known as the Great Purge, during which many were executed or sent to the Gulag. Central to this campaign were the Moscow Trials, a series of show trials of the purged top leaders of the party and the military. In 1936, as the trials proceeded, Khrushchev expressed his vehement support:
Everyone who rejoices in the successes achieved in our country, the victories of our party led by the great Stalin, will find only one word suitable for the mercenary, fascist dogs of the Trotskyite-Zinovievite gang. That word is execution. 
Khrushchev assisted in the purge of many friends and colleagues in the Moscow &quot;oblast&quot;. Of 38 top Party officials in Moscow city and province, 35 were killed—the three survivors were transferred to other parts of the USSR. Of the 146 Party secretaries of cities and districts outside Moscow city in the province, only 10 survived the purges. In his memoirs, Khrushchev noted that almost everyone who worked with him was arrested. By Party protocol, Khrushchev was required to approve these arrests and did little or nothing to save his friends and colleagues.

Party leaders were given numerical quotas of &quot;enemies&quot; to be turned in and arrested. In June 1937, the Politburo set a quota of 35,000 enemies to be arrested in Moscow province; 5,000 of these were to be executed. In reply, Khrushchev asked that 2,000 wealthy peasants, or &quot;kulaks&quot; living in Moscow be killed in part fulfillment of the quota. In any event, only two weeks after receiving the order, Khrushchev was able to report to Stalin that 41,305 &quot;criminal and &quot;kulak&quot; elements&quot; had been arrested. Of the arrestees, according to Khrushchev, 8,500 deserved execution.

Khrushchev had no reason to think himself immune from the purges, and in 1937, confessed his own 1923 dalliance with Trotskyism to Kaganovich, who, according to Khrushchev, &quot;blanched&quot; (for his protégé&#x27;s sins could affect his own standing) and advised him to tell Stalin. The dictator took the confession in his stride, and, after initially advising Khrushchev to keep it quiet, suggested that Khrushchev tell his tale to the Moscow party conference. Khrushchev did so, to applause, and was immediately reelected to his post. Khrushchev related in his memoirs that he was also denounced by an arrested colleague. Stalin told Khrushchev of the accusation personally. Khrushchev speculated in his memoirs that had Stalin doubted his reaction, he would have been categorized as an enemy of the people then and there. Nonetheless, Khrushchev became a candidate member of the Politburo on 14 January 1938 and a full member in March 1939.

In late 1937, Stalin appointed Khrushchev as head of the Communist Party in Ukraine. Khrushchev left Moscow for Kiev, again the Ukrainian capital, in January 1938. Ukraine had been the site of extensive purges, with the murdered including professors in Stalino whom Khrushchev greatly respected. The high ranks of the Party were not immune; the Central Committee of Ukraine was so devastated that it could not convene a quorum. After Khrushchev&#x27;s arrival, the pace of arrests accelerated. All but one member of the Ukrainian Politburo Organizational Bureau and Secretariat were arrested. Almost all government officials and Red Army commanders were replaced. During the first few months after Khrushchev&#x27;s arrival, almost everyone arrested was executed.

Biographer William Taubman suggested that because Khrushchev was again unsuccessfully denounced while in Kiev, he must have known that some of the denunciations were not true and that innocent people were suffering. In 1939, Khrushchev addressed the Fourteenth Ukrainian Party Congress, saying &quot;Comrades, we must unmask and relentlessly destroy all enemies of the people. But we must not allow a single honest Bolshevik to be harmed.&quot;

== World War II ==
=== Invasion of Poland and subsequent occupation ===
When Soviet troops, pursuant to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, invaded the eastern portion of Poland on 17 September 1939, Khrushchev accompanied the troops at Stalin&#x27;s direction. A large number of ethnic Ukrainians lived in the invaded area, much of which today forms the western portion of Ukraine. Many inhabitants initially welcomed the invasion, though they hoped that they would eventually become independent. Khrushchev&#x27;s role was to ensure that the occupied areas voted for union with the USSR. Through a combination of propaganda, deception as to what was being voted for, and outright fraud, the Soviets ensured that the assemblies elected in the new territories would unanimously petition for union with the USSR. When the new assemblies did so, their petitions were granted by the USSR Supreme Soviet, and Western Ukraine became a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on 1 November 1939. Clumsy actions by the Soviets, such as staffing Western Ukrainian organizations with Eastern Ukrainians, and giving confiscated land to collective farms (&quot;kolkhozes&quot;) rather than to peasants, soon alienated Western Ukrainians, damaging Khrushchev&#x27;s efforts to achieve unity.

=== War against Germany ===
When Nazi Germany invaded the USSR, in June 1941, Khrushchev was still at his post in Kiev. Stalin appointed him a political commissar, and Khrushchev served on a number of fronts as an intermediary between the local military commanders and the political rulers in Moscow. Stalin used Khrushchev to keep commanders on a tight leash, while the commanders sought to have him influence Stalin.

As the Germans advanced, Khrushchev worked with the military to defend and save Kiev. Handicapped by orders from Stalin that under no circumstances should the city be abandoned, the Red Army was soon encircled by the Germans. While the Germans stated they took 655,000 prisoners, according to the Soviets, 150,541 men out of 677,085 escaped. Primary sources differ on Khrushchev&#x27;s involvement. According to Marshal Georgy Zhukov, writing some years after Khrushchev fired and disgraced him in 1957, Khrushchev persuaded Stalin not to evacuate troops from Kiev. However, Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that he and Marshal Semyon Budyonny proposed redeploying Soviet forces to avoid the encirclement until Marshal Semyon Timoshenko arrived from Moscow with orders for the troops to hold their positions. Early Khrushchev biographer Mark Frankland suggested that Khrushchev&#x27;s faith in his leader was first shaken by the Red Army&#x27;s setbacks. Khrushchev stated in his memoirs:

In 1942, Khrushchev was on the Southwest Front, and he and Timoshenko proposed a massive counteroffensive in the Kharkov area. Stalin approved only part of the plan, but 640,000 Red Army soldiers were involved in the offensive. The Germans, however, had deduced that the Soviets were likely to attack at Kharkov, and set a trap. Beginning on 12 May 1942, the Soviet offensive initially appeared successful, but within five days the Germans had driven deep into the Soviet flanks, and the Red Army troops were in danger of being cut off. Stalin refused to halt the offensive, and the Red Army divisions were soon encircled by the Germans. The USSR lost about 267,000 soldiers, including more than 200,000 captured, and Stalin demoted Timoshenko and recalled Khrushchev to Moscow. While Stalin hinted at arresting and executing Khrushchev, he allowed the commissar to return to the front by sending him to Stalingrad.
Khrushchev reached the Stalingrad Front in August 1942, soon after the start of the battle for the city. His role in the Stalingrad defense was not major—General Vasily Chuikov, who led the city&#x27;s defense, mentions Khrushchev only briefly in a memoir published while Khrushchev was premier—but to the end of his life, he was proud of his role. Though he visited Stalin in Moscow on occasion, he remained in Stalingrad for much of the battle and was nearly killed at least once. He proposed a counterattack, only to find that Georgy Zhukov and other generals had already planned Operation Uranus, a plan to break out from Soviet positions and encircle and destroy the Germans; it was being kept secret. Before &quot;Uranus&quot; was launched, Khrushchev spent much time checking on troop readiness and morale, interrogating Nazi prisoners, and recruiting some for propaganda purposes.

Soon after Stalingrad, Khrushchev met with personal tragedy, as his son Leonid, a fighter pilot, was apparently shot down and killed in action on 11 March 1943. The circumstances of Leonid&#x27;s death remain obscure and controversial, as none of his fellow fliers stated that they witnessed him being shot down, nor was his plane found or body recovered. One theory has Leonid surviving the crash and collaborating with the Germans, and when he was recaptured by the Soviets, Stalin ordering him shot despite Khrushchev pleading for his life. This supposed killing is used to explain why Khrushchev later denounced Stalin. While there is no supporting evidence for this account in Soviet files, some historians allege that Leonid Khrushchev&#x27;s file was tampered with after the war. In later years, Leonid Khrushchev&#x27;s wingmate stated that he saw his plane disintegrate, but did not report it. Khrushchev biographer Taubman speculates that this omission was most likely to avoid the possibility of being seen as complicit in the death of the son of a Politburo member. In mid-1943, Leonid&#x27;s wife, Liuba Khrushcheva, was arrested on accusations of spying and sentenced to five years in a labor camp, and her son (by another relationship), Tolya, was placed in orphanages. Leonid&#x27;s daughter, Yulia, was raised by Nikita Khrushchev and his wife.

After &quot;Uranus&quot; forced the Germans into retreat, Khrushchev served on other fronts of the war. He was attached to Soviet troops at the Battle of Kursk, in July 1943, which turned back the last major German offensive on Soviet soil. Khrushchev related that he interrogated an SS defector, learning that the Germans intended an attack—a claim dismissed by his biographer Taubman as &quot;almost certainly exaggerated&quot;. He accompanied Soviet troops as they took Kiev in November 1943, entering the shattered city as Soviet forces drove out German troops. As Soviet forces met with greater success, driving the Nazis westwards towards Germany, Nikita Khrushchev became increasingly involved in reconstruction work in Ukraine. He was appointed Premier of the Ukrainian SSR in addition to his earlier party post, one of the rare instances in which the Ukrainian party and civil leader posts were held by one person.

According to Khrushchev biographer William Tompson, it is difficult to assess Khrushchev&#x27;s war record, since he most often acted as part of a military council, and it is not possible to know the extent to which he influenced decisions. However, Tompson points to the fact that the few mentions of Khrushchev in military memoirs published during the Brezhnev era were generally favorable, at a time when it was &quot;barely possible to mention Khrushchev in print in any context&quot;. Tompson suggests that these favorable mentions indicate that military officers held Khrushchev in high regard.

== Rise to power ==
=== Return to Ukraine ===

Almost all of Ukraine had been occupied by the Germans, and Khrushchev returned to his domain in late 1943 to find devastation. Ukraine&#x27;s industry had been destroyed, and agriculture faced critical shortages. Even though millions of Ukrainians had been taken to Germany as workers or prisoners of war, there was insufficient housing for those who remained. One out of every six Ukrainians were killed in World War II.

Khrushchev sought to reconstruct Ukraine and complete the interrupted work of imposing the Soviet system on it, though he hoped that the purges of the 1930s would not recur. As Ukraine was recovered militarily, conscription was imposed; 750,000 men aged between nineteen and fifty were sent to join the Red Army. Other Ukrainians joined partisan forces, seeking an independent Ukraine. Khrushchev rushed from district to district through Ukraine, urging the depleted labor force to greater efforts. He made a short visit to his birthplace of Kalinovka, finding a starving population, with only a third of the men who had joined the Red Army having returned. Khrushchev did what he could to assist his hometown. Despite Khrushchev&#x27;s efforts, in 1945, Ukrainian industry was at only a quarter of pre-war levels, and the harvest actually dropped from that of 1944, when the entire territory of Ukraine had not yet been retaken.

In an effort to increase agricultural production, the &quot;kolkhozes&quot; (collective farms) were empowered to expel residents who were not pulling their weight. &quot;Kolkhoz&quot; leaders used this as an excuse to expel their personal enemies, invalids, and the elderly, sending them to the eastern parts of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev viewed this policy as very effective and recommended its adoption elsewhere to Stalin. He also worked to impose collectivization on Western Ukraine. Lack of resources and armed resistance by partisans slowed the process. The partisans, many of whom fought as the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), were gradually defeated, as Soviet police and military reported killing 110,825 &quot;bandits&quot; and capturing a quarter million more between 1944 and 1946. About 600,000 Western Ukrainians were arrested between 1944 and 1952, with one-third executed and the remainder imprisoned or exiled to the east.

The war years of 1944 and 1945 had seen poor harvests, and 1946 saw intense drought strike Ukraine and Western Russia. Despite this, collective and state farms were required to turn over 52% of the harvest to the government. The Soviet government sought to collect as much grain as possible to supply communist allies in Eastern Europe. Khrushchev set the quotas at a high level, leading Stalin to expect an unrealistically large quantity of grain from Ukraine. Food was rationed—but non-agricultural rural workers throughout the USSR were given no ration cards. The inevitable starvation was largely confined to remote rural regions and was little noticed outside the USSR. Khrushchev, realizing the desperate situation in late 1946, repeatedly appealed to Stalin for aid, to be met with anger and resistance. When letters to Stalin had no effect, Khrushchev flew to Moscow and made his case in person. Stalin finally gave Ukraine limited food aid, and money to set up free soup kitchens. However, Khrushchev&#x27;s political standing had been damaged, and in February 1947, Stalin suggested that Lazar Kaganovich be sent to Ukraine to &quot;help&quot; Khrushchev. The following month, the Ukrainian Central Committee removed Khrushchev as party leader in favor of Kaganovich, while retaining him as premier.

Soon after Kaganovich arrived in Kiev, Khrushchev fell ill and was barely seen until September 1947. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicates he had pneumonia; some biographers have theorized that Khrushchev&#x27;s illness was entirely political, out of fear that his loss of position was the first step towards downfall and demise. However, Khrushchev&#x27;s children remembered their father as having been seriously ill. Once Khrushchev was able to get out of bed, he and his family took their first vacation since before the war, to a beachfront resort in Latvia. Khrushchev, though, soon broke the beach routine with duck-hunting trips, and a visit to the new Soviet Kaliningrad, where he toured factories and quarries. By the end of 1947, Kaganovich had been recalled to Moscow and the recovered Khrushchev had been restored to the First Secretaryship. He then resigned the Ukrainian premiership in favor of Demyan Korotchenko, Khrushchev&#x27;s protégé.

Khrushchev&#x27;s final years in Ukraine were generally peaceful, with industry recovering, Soviet forces overcoming the partisans, and 1947 and 1948 seeing better-than-expected harvests. Collectivization advanced in Western Ukraine, and Khrushchev implemented more policies that encouraged collectivization and discouraged private farms. These sometimes backfired, however: a tax on private livestock holdings led to peasants slaughtering their stock. With the idea of eliminating differences in attitude between town and countryside and transforming the peasantry into a &quot;rural proletariat&quot;, Khrushchev conceived the idea of the &quot;agro-town&quot;. Rather than agricultural workers living close to farms, they would live further away in larger towns which would offer municipal services such as utilities and libraries. He completed only one such town before his December 1949 return to Moscow; he dedicated it to Stalin as a 70th birthday present.

In his memoirs, Khrushchev spoke highly of Ukraine:
I&#x27;ll say that the Ukrainian people treated me well. I recall warmly the years I spent there. This was a period full of responsibilities, but pleasant because it brought satisfaction ... But far be it from me to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts ... I attribute Ukraine&#x27;s successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won&#x27;t elaborate further on this theme, but in principle, it&#x27;s very easy to demonstrate. I&#x27;m Russian myself, and I don&#x27;t want to offend the Russians.
=== Stalin&#x27;s final years ===

From mid-December 1949, Khrushchev served as head of the Party in Moscow city and province. His biographer Taubman suggests that Stalin most likely recalled Khrushchev to Moscow to balance the influence of Georgy Malenkov and security chief Lavrentiy Beria, who were widely seen as Stalin&#x27;s heirs. The aging leader rarely called Politburo meetings. Instead, much of the high-level work of government took place at dinners hosted by Stalin for his inner circle of Beria, Malenkov, Khrushchev, Kaganovich, Kliment Voroshilov, Vyacheslav Molotov, and Nikolai Bulganin. Khrushchev took early naps so that he would not fall asleep in Stalin&#x27;s presence; he noted in his memoirs, &quot;Things went badly for those who dozed off at Stalin&#x27;s table.&quot;

In 1950, Khrushchev began a large-scale housing program for Moscow. Five- or six-story apartment buildings became ubiquitous throughout the Soviet Union. Khrushchev had prefabricated reinforced concrete used, greatly speeding up construction. These structures were completed at triple the construction rate of Moscow housing from 1946 to 1950, lacked elevators or balconies, and were nicknamed &quot;khrushchyovka&quot; by the public, but because of their shoddy workmanship sometimes disparagingly called &quot;Khrushchoba&quot;, combining Khrushchev&#x27;s name with the Russian word &quot;trushchoba&quot;, meaning &quot;slum&quot;. In 1995, almost 60,000,000 residents of the former Soviet Union still lived in these buildings.

In his new positions, Khrushchev continued his &quot;kolkhoz&quot; consolidation scheme, which decreased the number of collective farms in Moscow Oblast by about 70%. This resulted in farms that were too large for one chairman to manage effectively. Khrushchev also sought to implement his agro-town proposal, but when his lengthy speech on the subject was published in &quot;Pravda&quot; in March 1951, Stalin disapproved of it. The periodical quickly published a note stating that Khrushchev&#x27;s speech was merely a proposal, not policy. In April, the Politburo disavowed the agro-town proposal. Khrushchev feared that Stalin would remove him from office, but the leader mocked Khrushchev, then allowed the episode to pass.

On 1 March 1953, Stalin had a massive stroke. As terrified doctors attempted treatment, Khrushchev and his colleagues engaged in an intense discussion as to the new government. On 5 March, Stalin died.

Khrushchev later reflected on Stalin:
Stalin called everyone who didn&#x27;t agree with him an &quot;enemy of the people.&quot; He said that they wanted to restore the old order, and for this purpose, &quot;the enemies of the people&quot; had linked up with the forces of reaction internationally. As a result, several hundred thousand honest people perished. Everyone lived in fear in those days. Everyone expected that at any moment there would be a knock on the door in the middle of the night and that knock on the door would prove fatal ... [P]eople not to Stalin&#x27;s liking were annihilated, honest party members, irreproachable people, loyal and hard workers for our cause who had gone through the school of revolutionary struggle under Lenin&#x27;s leadership. This was utter and complete arbitrariness. And now is all this to be forgiven and forgotten? Never!
=== Struggle for power ===
On 6 March 1953, Stalin&#x27;s death was announced, as was the new leadership. Malenkov was the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers, with Beria (who consolidated his hold over the security agencies), Kaganovich, Bulganin, and former Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov as first vice-chairmen. Those members of the Presidium of the Central Committee who had been recently promoted by Stalin were demoted. Khrushchev was relieved of his duties as Party head for Moscow to concentrate on unspecified duties in the Party&#x27;s Central Committee. &quot;The New York Times&quot; listed Malenkov and Beria first and second among the ten-man Presidium—and Khrushchev last.

However, Malenkov resigned from the secretariat of the Central Committee on 14 March. This came due to concerns that he was acquiring too much power. The major beneficiary was Khrushchev. His name appeared atop a revised list of secretaries—indicating that he was now in charge of the party. The Central Committee formally elected him First Secretary in September.

After Stalin&#x27;s death, Beria launched a number of reforms. According to Taubman, &quot;unparalleled in his cynicism, he [Beria] did not let ideology stand in his way. Had he prevailed, he would almost certainly have exterminated his colleagues, if only to prevent them from liquidating him. In the meantime, however, his burst of reforms rivaled Khrushchev&#x27;s and in some ways even Gorbachev&#x27;s&quot;. One proposal, which was adopted, was an amnesty which eventually led to the freeing of over a million non-political prisoners. Another, which was not adopted, was to release East Germany into a united, neutral Germany in exchange for compensation from the West—a proposal considered by Khrushchev to be anti-communist. Khrushchev allied with Malenkov to block many of Beria&#x27;s proposals, while the two slowly picked up support from other Presidium members. Their campaign against Beria was aided by fears that Beria was planning a military coup, and, according to Khrushchev in his memoirs, by the conviction that &quot;Beria is getting his knives ready for us.&quot; The key move by Khrushchev and Malenkov was to lure two of Beria&#x27;s most powerful deputy ministers, Sergei Kruglov and Ivan Serov, to betray their boss. This allowed Khrushchev and Malenkov to arrest Beria as Beria belatedly discovered he had lost control of Ministry of Interior troops and the troops of the Kremlin guard. On 26 June 1953, Beria was arrested at a Presidium meeting, following extensive military preparations by Khrushchev and his allies. Beria was tried in secret and executed in December 1953 with five of his close associates.

The power struggle continued. Malenkov&#x27;s power was in the central state apparatus, which he sought to extend through reorganizing the government, giving it additional power at the expense of the Party. He also sought public support by lowering retail prices and the level of bond sales to citizens, which had long been effectively obligatory. Khrushchev, with his power base in the Party, sought to strengthen the Party and his position within it. While, under the Soviet system, the Party was to be preeminent, it had been greatly drained of power by Stalin, who had given much of that power to himself and to the Politburo (later, to the Presidium). Khrushchev saw that with the Presidium in conflict, the Party and its Central Committee might again become powerful. Khrushchev carefully cultivated high Party officials and was able to appoint supporters as local Party bosses, who then took seats on the Central Committee.

Khrushchev presented himself as a down-to-earth activist prepared to take up any challenge, contrasting with Malenkov who, though sophisticated, came across as colourless. Khrushchev arranged for the Kremlin grounds to be opened to the public, an act with &quot;great public resonance&quot;. While both Malenkov and Khrushchev sought reforms to agriculture, Khrushchev&#x27;s proposals were broader and included the Virgin Lands Campaign, under which hundreds of thousands of young volunteers would settle and farm areas of Western Siberia and Northern Kazakhstan. While the scheme eventually became a tremendous disaster for Soviet agriculture, it was initially successful. In addition, Khrushchev possessed incriminating information on Malenkov, taken from Beria&#x27;s secret files. As Soviet prosecutors investigated the atrocities of Stalin&#x27;s last years, including the Leningrad case, they came across evidence of Malenkov&#x27;s involvement. Beginning in February 1954, Khrushchev replaced Malenkov in the seat of honour at Presidium meetings; in June, Malenkov ceased to head the list of Presidium members, which was thereafter organized in alphabetical order. Khrushchev&#x27;s influence continued to increase, winning the allegiance of local party heads, and with his nominee heading the KGB.

In 1954, the Soviet leadership with Khrushchev transferred Crimea from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR, a decision often attributed to Khrushchev&#x27;s origin. Other historians, though, point more to the pacification of inner-soviet tensions and to a move in the power game with Malenkov.

At a Central Committee meeting in January 1955, Malenkov was accused of involvement in atrocities, and the committee passed a resolution accusing him of involvement in the Leningrad case, and of facilitating Beria&#x27;s climb to power. At a meeting of the mostly ceremonial Supreme Soviet the following month, Malenkov was demoted in favor of Bulganin, to the surprise of Western observers. Malenkov remained in the Presidium as Minister of Electric Power Stations. According to Khrushchev biographer William Tompson, &quot;Khrushchev&#x27;s position as first among the members of the collective leadership was now beyond any reasonable doubt.&quot;

The post-Stalin battle for political control reshaped foreign policy. There was more realism and less ideological abstraction when confronted by European and Middle Eastern situations. Khrushchev&#x27;s &quot;secret speech&quot; attack on Stalin in 1956 was a signal for abandoning Stalinist precepts and looking at new options, including more involvement in the Middle East. Khrushchev in power did not moderate his personality—he remained unpredictable and was emboldened by the spectacular successes in space. He thought that would give the USSR world prestige, leading to quick Communist advances in the Third World. Khrushchev&#x27;s policy was still restrained by the need to retain the support of the Presidium and to placate the inarticulate but restive Soviet masses who were thrilled by Sputnik but demanded a higher standard of living on the ground as well.

=== Domestic policies ===
==== Consolidation of power and &quot;Secret Speech&quot; ====

After the demotion of Malenkov, Khrushchev and Molotov initially worked together well. Molotov even proposed that Khrushchev, not Bulganin, replace Malenkov as premier. However, Khrushchev and Molotov increasingly differed on policy. Molotov opposed the Virgin Lands policy, instead proposing heavy investment to increase yields in developed agricultural areas, which Khrushchev felt was not feasible due to a lack of resources and a lack of a sophisticated farm labor force. The two differed on foreign policy as well; soon after Khrushchev took power, he sought a peace treaty with Austria, which would allow Soviet troops then occupying part of the country to leave. Molotov was resistant, but Khrushchev arranged for an Austrian delegation to come to Moscow and negotiate the treaty. Although Khrushchev and other Presidium members attacked Molotov at a Central Committee meeting in mid-1955, accusing him of conducting a foreign policy which turned the world against the USSR, Molotov remained in his position.

By the end of 1955, thousands of political prisoners had returned home and told their experiences of the Gulag labor camps. Continuing investigation into the abuses brought home the full breadth of Stalin&#x27;s crimes to his successors. Working together with his close ally Anastas Mikoyan, Khrushchev believed that once the stain of Stalinism was removed, the Party would inspire loyalty among the people. Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming 20th Party Congress about Stalin&#x27;s crimes. Some of his colleagues, including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the disclosure and persuaded him to make his remarks in a closed session.

The 20th Party Congress opened on 14 February 1956. In his opening words in his initial address, Khrushchev denigrated Stalin by asking delegates to rise in honour of the Communist leaders who had died since the last congress, whom he named, equating Stalin with Klement Gottwald and the little-known Kyuichi Tokuda. In the early morning of 25 February, Khrushchev delivered what became known as the &quot;Secret Speech&quot; to a closed session of the Congress limited to Soviet delegates. In four hours, he demolished Stalin&#x27;s reputation. Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that the &quot;congress listened to me in silence. As the saying goes, you could have heard a pin drop. It was all so sudden and unexpected.&quot; Khrushchev told the delegates:
The Secret Speech did not fundamentally change Soviet society but had wide-ranging effects. The speech was a factor in unrest in Poland and revolution in Hungary later in 1956, and Stalin defenders led four days of rioting in his native Georgia in June, calling for Khrushchev to resign and Molotov to take over. In meetings where the Secret Speech was read, communists would make even more severe condemnations of Stalin (and of Khrushchev), and even call for multi-party elections. However, Stalin was not publicly denounced, and his portrait remained widespread through the USSR, from airports to Khrushchev&#x27;s Kremlin office. Mikhail Gorbachev, then a Komsomol official, recalled that though young and well-educated Soviets in his district were excited by the speech, many others decried it, either defending Stalin or seeing little point in digging up the past. Forty years later, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev applauded Khrushchev for his courage in taking a huge political risk and showing himself to be &quot;a moral man after all&quot;.

The term &quot;Secret Speech&quot; proved to be an utter misnomer. While the attendees at the Speech were all Soviet, Eastern European delegates were allowed to hear it the following night, read slowly to allow them to take notes. By 5 March, copies were being mailed throughout the Soviet Union, marked &quot;not for the press&quot; rather than &quot;top secret&quot;. An official translation appeared within a month in Poland; the Poles printed 12,000 extra copies, one of which soon reached the West. Khrushchev&#x27;s son, Sergei, later wrote: clearly, Father tried to ensure it would reach as many ears as possible. It was soon read at Komsomol meetings; that meant another eighteen million listeners. If you include their relatives, friends, and acquaintances, you could say that the entire country became familiar with the speech ... Spring had barely begun when the speech began circulating around the world.

The anti-Khrushchev minority in the Presidium was augmented by those opposed to Khrushchev&#x27;s proposals to decentralize authority over industry, which struck at the heart of Malenkov&#x27;s power base. During the first half of 1957, Malenkov, Molotov, and Kaganovich worked to quietly build support to dismiss Khrushchev. At an 18 June Presidium meeting at which two Khrushchev supporters were absent, the plotters moved that Bulganin, who had joined the scheme, take the chair, and proposed other moves which would effectively demote Khrushchev and put themselves in control. Khrushchev objected on the grounds that not all Presidium members had been notified, an objection which would have been quickly dismissed had Khrushchev not held firm control over the military, through Minister of Defense Marshal Zhukov, and the security departments. Lengthy Presidium meetings took place, continuing over several days. As word leaked of the power struggle, members of the Central Committee, which Khrushchev controlled, streamed to Moscow, many flown there aboard military planes, and demanded to be admitted to the meeting. While they were not admitted, there were soon enough Central Committee members in Moscow to call an emergency Party Congress, which effectively forced the leadership to allow a session of the Central Committee. At that meeting, the three main conspirators were dubbed the Anti-Party Group, and denounced with accusations of factionalism and complicity in Stalin&#x27;s crimes. The three were expelled from the Central Committee and Presidium, as was former Foreign Minister and Khrushchev client Dmitri Shepilov who joined them in the plot. Molotov was sent as Ambassador to Mongolia; the others were sent to head industrial facilities and institutes far from Moscow.

Marshal Zhukov was rewarded for his support with full membership in the Presidium, but Khrushchev feared his popularity and power. In October 1957, the defense minister was sent on a tour of the Balkans, as Khrushchev arranged a Presidium meeting to dismiss him. Zhukov learned what was happening, and hurried back to Moscow, only to be formally notified of his dismissal. At a Central Committee meeting several weeks later, not a word was said in Zhukov&#x27;s defense. Khrushchev completed the consolidation of power in March 1958, arranging for Bulganin&#x27;s dismissal as premier in favor of himself (Bulganin was appointed to head the &quot;Gosbank&quot;) and by establishing a USSR Defense Council, led by himself, effectively making him commander in chief. Though Khrushchev was now preeminent, he did not enjoy Stalin&#x27;s absolute power.

====Liberalization and the arts====
After assuming power, Khrushchev allowed a modest amount of freedom in the arts. Vladimir Dudintsev&#x27;s novel &quot;Not by Bread Alone&quot;, about an idealistic engineer opposed by rigid bureaucrats, was allowed to be published in 1956, though Khrushchev called the novel &quot;false at its base&quot;. In 1958, however, Khrushchev ordered a fierce attack on Boris Pasternak after his novel &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; was published abroad (he was denied permission to publish it in the Soviet Union). &quot;Pravda&quot; described the novel as &quot;low-grade reactionary hackwork&quot;, and the author was expelled from the Writer&#x27;s Union. Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, but under heavy pressure he declined it. Once he did so, Khrushchev ordered a halt to the attacks on Pasternak. In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that he agonized over the novel, very nearly allowed it to be published, and later regretted not doing so. After his fall from power, Khrushchev read the novel (he had earlier read only excerpts) and stated, &quot;We shouldn&#x27;t have banned it. I should have read it myself. There&#x27;s nothing anti-Soviet in it.&quot;

Khrushchev believed that the USSR could match the West&#x27;s living standards, and was not afraid to allow Soviet citizens to see Western achievements. Stalin had permitted few tourists to the Soviet Union, and had allowed few Soviets to travel. Khrushchev let Soviets travel (over two million Soviet citizens travelled abroad between 1957 and 1961, 700,000 of whom visited the West) and allowed foreigners to visit the Soviet Union, where tourists became subjects of immense curiosity. In 1957, Khrushchev authorized the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students to be held in Moscow that summer. He instructed Komsomol officials to &quot;smother foreign guests in our embrace&quot;. The resulting &quot;socialist carnival&quot; involved over three million Moscovites, who joined with 30,000 young foreign visitors in events that ranged from discussion groups throughout the city to events at the Kremlin itself. According to historian Vladislav Zubok, the festival &quot;shattered propagandist clichés&quot; about Westerners by allowing Moscovites to see them for themselves.

In 1962, Khrushchev, impressed by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot;, persuaded the Presidium to allow publication. That renewed thaw ended on 1 December 1962, when Khrushchev was taken to the Manezh Gallery to view an exhibit which included a number of avant-garde works. On seeing them, Khrushchev exploded with anger, an episode known as the Manege Affair, describing the artwork as &quot;dog shit&quot;, and proclaiming that &quot;a donkey could smear better art with its tail&quot;. A week later, &quot;Pravda&quot; issued a call for artistic purity. When writers and filmmakers defended the painters, Khrushchev extended his anger to them. However, despite the premier&#x27;s rage, none of the artists were arrested or exiled. The Manezh Gallery exhibit remained open and experienced a considerable rise in attendance after the article in &quot;Pravda&quot;.

==== Political reform ====
Under Khrushchev, the special tribunals operated by security agencies were abolished. These tribunals, known as &quot;troikas&quot;, had often ignored laws and procedures. Under the reforms, no prosecution for a political crime could be brought even in the regular courts unless approved by the local Party committee. This rarely happened; there were no major political trials under Khrushchev, and at most several hundred political prosecutions overall. Instead, other sanctions were imposed on Soviet dissidents, including loss of job or university position, or expulsion from the Party. During Khrushchev&#x27;s rule, forced hospitalization for the &quot;socially dangerous&quot; was introduced. According to author Roy Medvedev, who wrote an early analysis of Khrushchev&#x27;s years in power, &quot;political terror as an everyday method of government was replaced under Khrushchev by administrative means of repression&quot;.

In 1958, Khrushchev opened a Central Committee meeting to hundreds of Soviet officials; some were even allowed to address the meeting. For the first time, the proceedings of the committee were made public in book form, a practice which was continued at subsequent meetings. This openness, however, actually allowed Khrushchev greater control over the committee, since dissenters would have to make their case in front of a large, disapproving crowd.

In 1962, Khrushchev divided &quot;oblast&quot; level Party committees (&quot;obkoms&quot;) into two parallel structures, one for industry and one for agriculture. This was unpopular among Party &quot;apparatchiks&quot;, and led to confusions in the chain of command, as neither committee secretary had precedence over the other. As there were limited numbers of Central Committee seats from each &quot;oblast&quot;, the division set up the possibility of rivalry for office between factions, and, according to Medvedev, had the potential for beginning a two-party system. Khrushchev also ordered that one-third of the membership of each committee, from low-level councils to the Central Committee itself, be replaced at each election. This decree created tension between Khrushchev and the Central Committee, and upset the party leaders upon whose support Khrushchev had risen to power.

==== Agricultural policy ====

Khrushchev was an expert on agricultural policies and sensed an urgent need to reform the backward, inefficient system with ideas that worked in the US. He looked especially at collectivism, state farms, liquidation of machine-tractor stations, planning decentralization, economic incentives, increased labor and capital investment, new crops, and new production programs. Henry Ford had been at the center of American technology transfer to the Soviet Union in the 1930s; he sent over factory designs, engineers, and skilled craftsmen, as well as tens of thousands of Ford tractors. By the 1940s Khrushchev was keenly interested in American agricultural innovations, especially on large-scale family-operated farms in the Midwest. In the 1950s he sent several delegations to visit farms and land grant colleges, looking at successful farms that utilized high-yielding seed varieties, very large and powerful tractors and other machines, all guided by modern management techniques. Especially after his visit to the US in 1959, he was keenly aware of the need to emulate and even match American superiority and agricultural technology.

Khrushchev became a hyper-enthusiastic crusader to grow corn (maize). He established a corn institute in Ukraine and ordered thousands of hectares to be planted in the Virgin Lands. In 1955, Khrushchev advocated an Iowa-style corn belt in the Soviet Union, and a Soviet delegation visited the U.S. state that summer. The delegation chief was approached by farmer and corn seed salesman Roswell Garst, who persuaded him to visit Garst&#x27;s large farm. The Iowan visited the Soviet Union, where he became friends with Khrushchev, and Garst sold the USSR of seed corn. Garst warned the Soviets to grow the corn in the southern part of the country and to ensure there were sufficient stocks of fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides. This, however, was not done, as Khrushchev sought to plant corn even in Siberia, and without the necessary chemicals. The corn experiment was not a great success, and he later complained that overenthusiastic officials had overplanted without laying the proper groundwork, and &quot;as a result corn was discredited as a silage crop—and so was I&quot;.

Khrushchev sought to abolish the Machine-Tractor Stations (MTS) which not only owned most large agricultural machines but also provided services such as plowing, and transfer their equipment and functions to the &quot;kolkhozes&quot; and &quot;sovkhozes&quot; (state farms). After a successful test involving MTS which served one large &quot;kolkhoz&quot; each, Khrushchev ordered a gradual transition—but then ordered that the change take place with great speed. Within three months, over half of the MTS facilities had been closed, and &quot;kolkhozes&quot; were being required to buy the equipment, with no discount given for older or dilapidated machines. MTS employees, unwilling to bind themselves to &quot;kolkhozes&quot; and lose their state employee benefits and the right to change their jobs, fled to the cities, creating a shortage of skilled operators. The costs of the machinery, plus the costs of building storage sheds and fuel tanks for the equipment, impoverished many &quot;kolkhozes&quot;. Inadequate provisions were made for repair stations. Without the MTS, the market for Soviet agricultural equipment fell apart, as the &quot;kolkhozes&quot; now had neither the money nor skilled buyers to purchase new equipment.

In the 1940s Stalin put Trofim Lysenko in charge of agricultural research, with his ideas that flouted modern genetics science. Lysenko maintained his influence under Khrushchev, and helped block the adoption of American techniques. In 1959, Khrushchev announced a goal of overtaking the US in the production of milk, meat, and butter. Local officials kept Khrushchev happy with unrealistic pledges of production. These goals were met by farmers who slaughtered their breeding herds and by purchasing meat at state stores, then reselling it back to the government, artificially increasing recorded production.

In June 1962, food prices were raised, particularly on meat and butter, by 25–30%. This caused public discontent. In the southern Russian city of Novocherkassk, this discontent escalated to a strike and a revolt against the authorities. The revolt was put down by the military, resulting in a massacre that killed 22 people and wounded 87 according to Soviet official accounts. In addition, 116 demonstrators were convicted of involvement and seven were executed. Information about the revolt was completely suppressed in the USSR, but spread through Samizdat and damaged Khrushchev&#x27;s reputation in the West.

Drought struck the Soviet Union in 1963; the harvest of of grain was down from a peak of in 1958. The shortages resulted in bread lines, a fact at first kept from Khrushchev. Reluctant to purchase food in the West, but faced with the alternative of widespread hunger, Khrushchev exhausted the nation&#x27;s hard currency reserves and expended part of its gold stockpile in the purchase of grain and other foodstuffs.

====Education====

While visiting the United States in 1959, Khrushchev was impressed by the agricultural education program at Iowa State University, and sought to imitate it in the Soviet Union. At the time, the main agricultural college in the USSR was in Moscow, and students did not do the manual labor of farming. Khrushchev proposed moving the programs to rural areas. He was unsuccessful, due to resistance from professors and students, who never actually disagreed with the premier, but who did not carry out his proposals. Khrushchev recalled in his memoirs: It&#x27;s nice to live in Moscow and work at the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy. It&#x27;s a venerable old institution, a large economic unit, with skilled instructors, but it&#x27;s in the city! Its students aren&#x27;t yearning to work on the collective farms because to do that they&#x27;d have to go out in the provinces and live in the sticks.

Khrushchev founded several academic towns, such as Akademgorodok. The premier believed that Western science flourished because many scientists lived in university towns such as Oxford, isolated from big-city distractions, and had pleasant living conditions and good pay. He sought to duplicate those conditions. Khrushchev&#x27;s attempt was generally successful, though his new towns and scientific centres tended to attract younger scientists, with older ones unwilling to leave Moscow or Leningrad.

Khrushchev also proposed to restructure Soviet high schools. While the high schools provided a college preparatory curriculum, few Soviet youths went on to university. Khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training. In practice, schools developed links with nearby enterprises and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the organizations disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn.

While the vocational proposal would not survive Khrushchev&#x27;s downfall, a longer-lasting change was a related establishment of specialized high schools. These schools were modeled after the foreign-language schools that had been established in Moscow and Leningrad beginning in 1949. In 1962, a special summer school was established in Novosibirsk to prepare students for the Siberian math and science Olympiad. The following year, the Novosibirsk Maths and Science Boarding-School became the first permanent residential school specializing in math and science. Other such schools were soon established in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev. By the early 1970s, over 100 specialized schools had been established, in mathematics, the sciences, art, music, and sport. Preschool education was increased as part of Khrushchev&#x27;s reforms, and by the time he left office, about 22% of Soviet children attended preschool—about half of urban children, but only about 12% of rural children.

====Anti-religious campaign====
The anti-religious campaign of the Khrushchev era began in 1959, coinciding with the 21st Party Congress. It was carried out by mass closures of churches (reducing the number from 22,000 in 1959 to 13,008 in 1960 and to 7,873 by 1965), monasteries, convents, and seminaries. The campaign also included a restriction on parental rights to teach religion to their children; a ban on the presence of children at church services; and a ban on the administration of the Eucharist to children over the age of four. Khrushchev additionally banned all services held outside of churches&#x27; walls, renewed enforcement of 1929 legislation banning pilgrimages, and recorded the personal identities of all adults requesting church baptisms, weddings, or funerals. He disallowed the ringing of church bells and services in daytime in some rural settings from May to the end of October under the pretext of fieldwork requirements. Non-fulfillment of these regulations by clergy would lead to disallowance of state registration (meaning clergy could no longer do any pastoral or liturgical work without special state permission). According to Dimitry Pospielovsky, the state carried out forced retirement, arrests, and prison sentences for clergymen on &quot;trumped-up charges,&quot; but in reality, he writes, said state actions were taken against clergy who resisted the closure of churches; delivered sermons attacking the USSR&#x27;s state atheism and anti-religious campaign; conducted Christian charity; or made religion popular by personal example.

=== Foreign and defense policies ===

From 1950 to 1953 Khrushchev was well-placed to closely observe and evaluate Stalin&#x27;s foreign policy. Khrushchev considered the entire Cold War to be a serious mistake on Stalin&#x27;s part. In the long term, it created an unnecessary and expensive militarized struggle with NATO. It diverted attention away from the neutral developing world, where progress could be made, and it weakened Moscow&#x27;s relationship with its East European satellites. Basically Khrushchev was much more optimistic about the future than Stalin or Molotov, and was more of an internationalist. He believed the working classes and the common peoples of the world would eventually find their way towards socialism and even communism, and that conflicts like the Cold War diverted their attention from this eventual goal. Peaceful coexistence of the sort that Lenin himself had practiced at first would allow the Soviet Union and its satellite states to build up their economies and their standard of living. Khrushchev decided that Stalin had made a series of mistakes, such as heavy-handed pressure in Turkey and Iran in 1945 and 1946, and especially heavy pressure on Berlin that led to the failed Berlin blockade in 1948. Germany was a major issue for Khrushchev, not because he feared a NATO invasion eastward, but because it weakened the East German regime, which economically paled in comparison to the economic progress of West Germany. Khrushchev blamed Molotov for being unable to resolve the conflict with Yugoslavia, and largely ignoring the needs of the East European communist satellites.

Khrushchev chose Austria as a way to quickly come to agreement with NATO. It became a small neutralized nation economically tied to the West but diplomatically neutral and no threat.

When Khrushchev took control, the outside world still knew little of him, and initially was not impressed by him. Short, heavyset, and wearing ill-fitting suits, he &quot;radiated energy but not intellect&quot;, and was dismissed by many as a buffoon who would not last long. British Foreign Secretary Harold Macmillan wondered, &quot;How can this fat, vulgar man with his pig eyes and ceaseless flow of talk be the head—the aspirant Tsar for all those millions of people?&quot;

Khrushchev biographer Tompson stated:

He could be charming or vulgar, ebullient or sullen, he was given to public displays of rage (often contrived) and to soaring hyperbole in his rhetoric. But whatever he was, however, he came across, he was more human than his predecessor or even than most of his foreign counterparts, and for much of the world that was enough to make the USSR seem less mysterious or menacing.
====United States and NATO====
=====Early relations and U.S. visit (1957–1960)=====

Khrushchev sought to find a lasting solution to the problem of a divided Germany and of the enclave of West Berlin. In November 1958, calling West Berlin a &quot;malignant tumor&quot;, he gave the United States, United Kingdom and France six months to conclude a peace treaty with both German states and the Soviet Union. If one was not signed, Khrushchev stated, the Soviet Union would conclude a peace treaty with East Germany. This would leave East Germany, which was not a party to treaties giving the Western Powers access to Berlin, in control of the routes to the city. They proposed making Berlin a free city, which meant no outside military forces would be stationed there. West Germany, United States and France strongly opposed the ultimatum, but Britain wanted to consider it as a starting point for negotiations. No one wanted to risk war over the issue. At Britain&#x27;s request, Khrushchev extended and ultimately dropped the ultimatum, as the Berlin issue became part of the complex agenda of high-level summit meetings.

Khrushchev sought to sharply reduce levels of conventional weapons and to defend the Soviet Union with missiles. He believed that without this transition, the huge Soviet military would continue to eat up resources, making Khrushchev&#x27;s goals of improving Soviet life difficult to achieve. He abandoned Stalin&#x27;s plans for a large navy in 1955, believing that the new ships would be too vulnerable to either a conventional or nuclear attack. In January 1960, he took advantage of improved relations with the U.S. to order a reduction of one-third in the size of Soviet armed forces, alleging that advanced weapons would make up for the lost troops. While conscription of Soviet youth remained in force, exemptions from military service became more and more common, especially for students.

Campbell Craig and Sergey Radchenko argue that Khrushchev thought that policies like Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) were too dangerous for the Soviet Union. His approach did not greatly change his foreign policy or military doctrine but is apparent in his determination to choose options that minimized the risk of war. The Soviets had few operable intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), but Khrushchev publicly boasted of the Soviets&#x27; missile programs, stating that Soviet weapons were varied and numerous. The First Secretary hoped that public perception that the Soviets were ahead would put psychological pressure on the West resulting in political concessions. The Soviet space program, which Khrushchev firmly supported, appeared to confirm his claims when the Soviets launched Sputnik 1 into orbit, a feat that astonished the world. Western governments concluded that the Soviet ICBM program was further along than it actually was. Khrushchev added to this misapprehension by stating in an October 1957 interview that the USSR had all the rockets, of whatever capacity, that it needed.
For years, Khrushchev would make a point of preceding a major foreign trip with a rocket launch, to the discomfiture of his hosts. In January 1960 Khrushchev told the Presidium that Soviet ICBMs made an agreement with the U.S. possible because &quot;main-street Americans have begun to shake from fear for the first times in their lives&quot;. The United States had learned of the underdeveloped state of the Soviet missile program from overflights in the late 1950s, but only high U.S. officials knew of the deception. The perception of a &quot;missile gap&quot; led to a considerable defense buildup on the part of the United States.

During Vice President Nixon&#x27;s visit to the Soviet Union in 1959 he and Khrushchev took part in what later became known as the Kitchen Debate. Nixon and Khrushchev had an impassioned argument in a model kitchen at the American National Exhibition in Moscow, with each defending the economic system of his country.

Nixon invited Khrushchev to visit the United States, and he agreed. He made his first visit to the United States, arriving in Washington, on 15 September 1959, spending thirteen days in the country. This first visit by a Soviet premier resulted in an extended media circus. Khrushchev brought his wife and adult children with him, though it was not usual for Soviet officials to travel with their families. He visited New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco (visiting a supermarket), Coon Rapids, Iowa (visiting Roswell Garst&#x27;s farm), Pittsburgh, and Washington, concluding with a meeting with President Eisenhower at Camp David. During luncheon at the Twentieth Century-Fox Studio in Los Angeles Khrushchev engaged in an improvised yet jovial debate with his host Spyros Skouras over the merits of capitalism and communism. Khrushchev was also to visit Disneyland, but the visit was canceled for security reasons, much to his disgruntlement. He did, however, visit Eleanor Roosevelt at her home. While visiting IBM&#x27;s new research campus in San Jose, California, Khrushchev expressed little interest in computer technology, but he greatly admired the self-service cafeteria, and, on his return, introduced self-service in the Soviet Union.

This visit resulted in an informal agreement that there would be no firm deadline over Berlin, but that there would be a four-power summit to try to resolve the issue. The Russian&#x27;s goal was to present warmth, charm and peacefulness, using candid interviews to convince Americans of his humanity and good will. He performed well and Theodore Windt calls it &quot;the zenith of his career.&quot; The friendly American audiences convinced Khrushchev that he had achieved a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower and that he could achieve détente with the Americans. Eisenhower was actually unimpressed by the Soviet leader. He pushed for an immediate summit but was frustrated by French President Charles de Gaulle, who postponed it until 1960, a year in which Eisenhower was scheduled to pay a return visit to the Soviet Union.

=====U-2 and Berlin crisis (1960–1961)=====
A constant irritant in Soviet–U.S. relations was the overflight of the Soviet Union by American U-2 spy aircraft. On 9 April 1960, the U.S. resumed such flights after a lengthy break. The Soviets had protested the flights in the past but had been ignored by Washington. Content in what he thought was a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower, Khrushchev was confused and angered by the flights&#x27; resumption, and concluded that they had been ordered by CIA Director Allen Dulles without Eisenhower&#x27;s knowledge. Khrushchev planned to visit the U.S. to meet Eisenhower, but the visit was canceled when Soviet Air Defence Forces brought down the U.S. U-2. On 1 May, a U-2 was shot down, its pilot, Francis Gary Powers, captured alive. Believing Powers to have been killed, the U.S. announced that a weather plane had been lost near the Turkish-Soviet border. Khrushchev risked destroying the summit, due to start on 16 May in Paris, if he announced the shootdown, but would look weak in the eyes of his military and security forces if he did nothing. On 5 May, Khrushchev announced the shootdown and Powers&#x27; capture, blaming the overflight on &quot;imperialist circles and militarists, whose stronghold is the Pentagon&quot;, and suggesting the plane had been sent without Eisenhower&#x27;s knowledge. Eisenhower could not have it thought that there were rogue elements in the Pentagon operating without his knowledge, and admitted that he had ordered the flights, calling them &quot;a distasteful necessity&quot;. The admission stunned Khrushchev and turned the U-2 affair from a possible triumph to a disaster for him, and he even appealed to U.S. Ambassador Llewellyn Thompson for help.

Khrushchev was undecided what to do at the summit even as he boarded his flight. He finally decided, in consultation with his advisers on the plane and Presidium members in Moscow, to demand an apology from Eisenhower and a promise that there would be no further U-2 flights in Soviet airspace. Neither Eisenhower nor Khrushchev communicated with the other in the days before the summit, and at the summit, Khrushchev made his demands and stated that there was no purpose in the summit, which should be postponed for six to eight months, until after the 1960 United States presidential election. The U.S. president offered no apology but stated that the flights had been suspended and would not resume and renewed his Open Skies proposal for mutual overflight rights. This was not enough for Khrushchev, who left the summit. Eisenhower accused Khrushchev &quot;of sabotaging this meeting, on which so much of the hopes of the world have rested&quot;. Eisenhower&#x27;s visit to the Soviet Union, for which the premier had even built a golf course so the U.S. president could enjoy his favorite sport, was cancelled by Khrushchev.

Khrushchev made his second and final visit to the US in September 1960. He had no invitation but had appointed himself as head of the USSR&#x27;s UN delegation. He spent much of his time wooing the new Third World states which had recently become independent. The U.S. restricted him to the island of Manhattan, with visits to an estate owned by the USSR on Long Island. The notorious shoe-banging incident occurred during a debate on 12 October over a Soviet resolution decrying colonialism. Khrushchev was infuriated by a statement of the Filipino delegate Lorenzo Sumulong charging the Soviets with employing a double standard by decrying colonialism while dominating Eastern Europe. Khrushchev demanded the right to reply immediately and accused Sumulong of being &quot;a fawning lackey of the American imperialists&quot;. Sumulong accused the Soviets of hypocrisy. Khrushchev yanked off his shoe and began banging it on his desk. This behavior by Khrushchev scandalized his delegation.

Khrushchev considered U.S. Vice President Nixon a hardliner and was delighted by his defeat in the 1960 presidential election. He considered the victor, John F. Kennedy, as a far more likely partner for détente, but was taken aback by the newly inaugurated U.S. President&#x27;s tough talk and actions in the early days of his administration. Khrushchev achieved a propaganda victory in April 1961 with the first human spaceflight, while Kennedy suffered a defeat with the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion. While Khrushchev had threatened to defend Cuba with Soviet missiles, the premier contented himself with after-the-fact aggressive remarks. The failure in Cuba led to Kennedy&#x27;s determination to make no concessions at the Vienna summit scheduled for 3 June 1961. Both Kennedy and Khrushchev took a hard line, with Khrushchev demanding a treaty that would recognize the two German states and refusing to yield on the remaining issues obstructing a test-ban treaty. Kennedy, in contrast, had been led to believe that the test-ban treaty could be concluded at the summit, and felt that a deal on Berlin had to await easing of east–west tensions.

An indefinite postponement of action over Berlin was unacceptable to Khrushchev if for no other reason than that East Germany was suffering a continuous brain drain as highly educated East Germans fled west through Berlin. While the boundary between the two German states had elsewhere been fortified, Berlin, administered by the four Allied powers, remained open. Emboldened by statements from former U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Charles E. Bohlen and United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Chairman J. William Fulbright that East Germany had every right to close its borders, Khrushchev authorized East German leader Walter Ulbricht to begin construction of what became known as the Berlin Wall. Construction preparations were made in great secrecy, and the border was sealed off in the early hours of Sunday, 13 August 1961, when most East German workers who earned hard currency by working in West Berlin would be at their homes. The wall was a propaganda disaster and marked the end of Khrushchev&#x27;s attempts to conclude a peace treaty among the Four Powers and the two German states. That treaty would not be signed until September 1990, as an immediate prelude to German reunification.

====Cuban Missile Crisis and the test ban treaty (1962–1964)====
Superpower tensions culminated in the Cuban Missile Crisis (in the USSR, the &quot;Caribbean crisis&quot;) of October 1962, as the Soviet Union sought to install medium-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, about from the U.S. coast. Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro was reluctant to accept the missiles, and, once he was persuaded, warned Khrushchev against transporting the missiles in secret. Castro stated, thirty years later, &quot;We had a sovereign right to accept the missiles. We were not violating international law. Why do it secretly—as if we had no right to do it? I warned Nikita that secrecy would give the imperialists the advantage.&quot;

On 16 October, Kennedy was informed that U-2 flights over Cuba had discovered what were most likely medium-range missile sites, and though he and his advisors considered approaching Khrushchev through diplomatic channels, they could come up with no way of doing this that would not appear weak. On 22 October, Kennedy addressed his nation by television, revealing the missiles&#x27; presence and announcing a blockade of Cuba. Informed in advance of the speech but not (until one hour before) the content, Khrushchev and his advisors feared an invasion of Cuba. Even before Kennedy&#x27;s speech, they ordered Soviet commanders in Cuba that they could use all weapons against an attack—except atomic weapons.

As the crisis unfolded, tensions were high in the U.S.; less so in the Soviet Union, where Khrushchev made several public appearances and went to the Bolshoi Theatre to hear American opera singer Jerome Hines. By 25 October, with the Soviets unclear about Kennedy&#x27;s full intentions, Khrushchev decided that the missiles would have to be withdrawn from Cuba. Khrushchev agreed to withdraw the missiles in exchange for a U.S. promise not to invade Cuba and a secret promise that the U.S. would withdraw missiles from Turkey. As the last term was not publicly announced at the request of the U.S., and was not known until just before Khrushchev&#x27;s death in 1971, the resolution was seen as a great defeat for the Soviets and contributed to Khrushchev&#x27;s fall less than two years later. Castro had urged Khrushchev to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on the U.S. in the event of an invasion of Cuba, and was angered by the outcome, referring to Khrushchev in profane terms.

After the crisis, superpower relations improved, as Kennedy gave a conciliatory speech on 10 June 1963, recognizing the Soviet people&#x27;s suffering during World War II, and paying tribute to their achievements. Khrushchev called the speech the best by a U.S. president since Franklin D. Roosevelt, and, in July, negotiated a test ban treaty with U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman and Lord Hailsham of the United Kingdom. Plans for a second Khrushchev-Kennedy summit were dashed by Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in November 1963. The new U.S. president, Lyndon Johnson, hoped for continued improved relations but was distracted by other issues and had little opportunity to develop a relationship with Khrushchev before the premier was ousted.

====Eastern Europe====
The Secret Speech, combined with the death of the Polish communist leader Bolesław Bierut, who suffered a heart attack while reading the Speech, sparked considerable liberalization in Poland and Hungary. In Poland, a worker&#x27;s strike in Poznań developed into disturbances that left more than 50 dead in June 1956. When Moscow blamed the disturbances on Western agitators, Polish leaders ignored the claim and made concessions to the workers. With anti-Soviet displays becoming more common in Poland, and crucial Polish leadership elections upcoming, Khrushchev and other Presidium members flew to Warsaw on 19 October to meet with the Polish Presidium. The Soviets agreed to allow the new Polish leadership to take office, on the assurance there would be no change to the Soviet-Polish relationship. A period of at least partial liberalization, known as the Polish October, followed.

The Polish settlement emboldened the Hungarians. A mass demonstration in Budapest on 23 October turned into a popular uprising. In response, Hungarian Party leaders installed reformist Premier Imre Nagy. Soviet forces in the city clashed with Hungarians and fired on demonstrators, with hundreds of both Hungarians and Soviets killed. Nagy called for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of Soviet troops, which a Khrushchev-led majority in the Presidium decided to obey, choosing to give the new Hungarian government a chance. Khrushchev assumed that if Moscow announced liberalization in how it dealt with its allies, Nagy would adhere to the alliance with the Soviet Union.

On 30 October Nagy announced multiparty elections, and the next morning that Hungary would leave the Warsaw Pact. On 3 November, two members of the Nagy government appeared in Ukraine as the self-proclaimed heads of a provisional government and demanded Soviet intervention, which was forthcoming. The next day, Soviet troops crushed the Hungarian uprising, with a death toll of 4,000 Hungarians and several hundred Soviet troops. Nagy was arrested and later executed. Despite the international outrage over the intervention, Khrushchev defended his actions for the rest of his life. Damage to Soviet foreign relations was severe and would have been greater were it not for the timing of the Suez crisis, which distracted world attention.

In the aftermath of these crises, Khrushchev made the statement for which he became well-remembered, &quot;We will bury you&quot;. While many in the West took this statement as a threat, Khrushchev made the statement in a speech on peaceful coexistence with the West. When questioned about the statement during his 1959 U.S. visit, Khrushchev stated that he was not referring to a literal burial, but that, through inexorable historical development, communism would replace capitalism.

Khrushchev greatly improved relations with Yugoslavia, which had been entirely sundered in 1948 when Stalin realized he could not control Yugoslav leader Josip Tito. Khrushchev led a Soviet delegation to Belgrade in 1955. Though a hostile Tito did everything he could to make the Soviets look foolish, Khrushchev was successful in warming relations, ending the Informbiro period. During the Hungarian crisis, Tito initially supported Nagy, but Khrushchev persuaded him of the need for intervention. Still, the intervention in Hungary damaged Moscow&#x27;s relationship with Belgrade, which Khrushchev spent several years trying to repair. He was hampered by the fact that China disapproved of Yugoslavia&#x27;s reformist socialism and attempts to conciliate Belgrade resulted in an angry Beijing.

====China====

After completing his takeover of mainland China in 1949, Mao Zedong sought material assistance from the USSR, and also called for the return to China of territories taken from it under the Tsars. Khrushchev increased aid to China, even sending a small corps of experts to help develop the new communist country. This assistance was described by historian William C. Kirby as &quot;the greatest transfer of technology in world history&quot;. The Soviet Union spent 7% of its national income between 1954 and 1959 on aid to China. On his 1954 visit to China, Khrushchev agreed to return Port Arthur and Dalian to China, though Khrushchev was annoyed by Mao&#x27;s insistence that the Soviets leave their artillery.

Mao bitterly opposed Khrushchev&#x27;s attempts to reach a &quot;rapprochement&quot; with more liberal Eastern European states such as Yugoslavia. Khrushchev&#x27;s government was reluctant to endorse Mao&#x27;s desires for an assertive worldwide revolutionary movement, preferring to conquer capitalism through raising the standard of living in communist-bloc countries.

Relations between the two nations began to cool in 1956, with Mao angered both by the Secret Speech and by the fact that the Chinese had not been consulted in advance about it. Mao believed that de-Stalinization was a mistake and a possible threat to his own authority. When Khrushchev visited Beijing in 1958, Mao refused proposals for military cooperation. Hoping to torpedo Khrushchev&#x27;s efforts at détente with the U.S., Mao soon thereafter provoked the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, describing the Taiwanese islands as &quot;batons that keep Eisenhower and Khrushchev dancing, scurrying this way and that.&quot;

The Soviets had planned to provide China with an atomic bomb and full documentation, but in 1959, amid cooler relations, the Soviets destroyed the device and papers instead. When Khrushchev visited China in September, shortly after his successful U.S. visit, he met a chilly reception, and left the country on the third day of a planned seven-day visit. Relations continued to deteriorate in 1960, as both the USSR and China used a Romanian Communist Party congress as an opportunity to attack the other. Khrushchev responded by pulling Soviet experts out of China.

====West Africa====
Under Khrushchev, the Soviet Union provided considerable aid to the newly independent Ghana and Guinea. These were seen as ideal places to test the &quot;socialist model of development&quot; because of their critical dependence on economic cooperation with the Soviet Union, in contrast to larger Third World nations like Egypt and Indonesia. This project proved to be a resounding failure, although the lessons learned would have an important influence on Soviet foreign policy towards Africa in the following decades. The Soviet Union&#x27;s display of ineptitude during the Congo Crisis, where it failed to prevent both the newly independent Republic of the Congo from descending into chaos and the substantial military intervention by Western powers, led to a further cooling of relations between the Soviet Union and its Ghanaian and Guinean partners.

==Removal==

Beginning in March 1964, Supreme Soviet presidium chairman and thus nominal head of state Leonid Brezhnev began plotting Khrushchev&#x27;s removal with his colleagues. While Brezhnev considered having Khrushchev arrested as he returned from a trip to Scandinavia in June, he instead persuaded members of the Central Committee to support the ousting of Khrushchev, remembering how crucial the committee&#x27;s support had been to Khrushchev in defeating the Anti-Party Group plot. Brezhnev had ample time for his conspiracy, as Khrushchev was absent from Moscow for a total of five months between January and September 1964.

The conspirators, led by Brezhnev, First Deputy Premier Alexander Shelepin, and KGB chairman Vladimir Semichastny, struck in October 1964, while Khrushchev was on vacation at Pitsunda with his friend and Presidium colleague Anastas Mikoyan. On 12 October, Brezhnev called Khrushchev to notify him of a special Presidium meeting to be held the following day, ostensibly about agriculture. Even though Khrushchev suspected the real reason for the meeting, he flew to Moscow, accompanied by the head of the Georgian KGB, General Aleksi Inauri, but otherwise taking no precautions.

Khrushchev arrived at the VIP hall of Vnukovo Airport; KGB chairman Semichastny waited for him there, flanked by KGB guards. Semichastny informed Khrushchev of his ouster and told him not to resist. The plotters&#x27; coup went off smoothly; Khrushchev felt betrayed by Semichastny, as he considered him a friend, not suspecting that he had joined his enemies within the Party. Khrushchev was then taken to the Kremlin, to be verbally attacked by Brezhnev, Suslov and Shelepin. He put up little resistance. Semichastny was careful not to create the appearance of a coup:

That night, after his ouster, Khrushchev called Mikoyan:

On 14 October 1964, the Presidium and the Central Committee voted to accept Khrushchev&#x27;s &quot;voluntary&quot; request to retire for reasons of &quot;advanced age and ill health.&quot; Brezhnev was elected First Secretary, while Alexei Kosygin succeeded Khrushchev as premier.

==Life in retirement==
Khrushchev was granted a pension of 500 rubles per month and was given a house, a dacha and a car. Following his removal, he fell into deep depression. He received few visitors, especially since his security guards reported all visits. His pension was reduced to 400 rubles per month, though his retirement remained comfortable by Soviet standards. One of his grandsons was asked what the ex-premier was doing in retirement, and the boy replied, &quot;Grandfather cries.&quot; Khrushchev was made a non-person to such an extent that the thirty-volume &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot; omitted him from the list of prominent political commissars during the Great Patriotic War.

As the new rulers made known their conservatism in artistic matters, Khrushchev came to be more favorably viewed by artists and writers, some of whom visited him. One visitor whom Khrushchev regretted not seeing was former U.S. Vice President Nixon, who went to Khrushchev&#x27;s Moscow apartment while the former premier was at his dacha.

Khrushchev began his memoirs in 1966. He initially tried to dictate them into a tape recorder while outdoors, in an attempt to avoid eavesdropping by the KGB. These attempts failed due to background noise, so he switched to recording indoors. The KGB made no attempt to interfere until 1968, when Khrushchev was ordered to hand over his tapes; he refused. While Khrushchev was hospitalized with heart ailments, his son Sergei was approached by the KGB in July 1970 and told that there was a plot afoot by foreign agents to steal the memoirs. Sergei Khrushchev handed over the materials to the KGB since the KGB could steal the originals anyway, but copies had been made, some of which had been transmitted to a Western publisher. Sergei instructed that the smuggled memoirs should be published, which they were in 1970 under the title &quot;Khrushchev Remembers&quot;. Under some pressure, Nikita Khrushchev signed a statement that he had not given the materials to any publisher, and his son was transferred to a less desirable job. Upon publication of the memoirs in the West, &quot;Izvestia&quot; denounced them as a fraud. Soviet state radio carried the announcement of Khrushchev&#x27;s statement; it was the first time in six years that he had been mentioned in that medium.

==Death==
Khrushchev died of a heart attack around noon in the Moscow Central Clinical Hospital on 11 September 1971, at the age of 77. He was denied a state funeral with interment in the Kremlin Wall and was instead buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. Fearing demonstrations, the authorities did not announce Khrushchev&#x27;s death until the hour of his wake, held in a morgue in the southern suburbs of Moscow, and surrounded the cemetery with troops. Even so, some artists and writers joined the family for the interment.

&quot;Pravda&quot; ran a one-sentence announcement of the former premier&#x27;s death; Western newspapers contained considerable coverage. &quot;New York Times&quot; Moscow correspondent Harry Schwartz wrote of Khrushchev, &quot;Mr. Khrushchev opened the doors and windows of a petrified structure. He let in fresh air and fresh ideas, producing changes which time already has shown are irreversible and fundamental.&quot;

==Legacy==
Many of Khrushchev&#x27;s innovations were reversed after his fall. The requirement that one-third of officials be replaced at each election was overturned, as was the division in the Party structure between industrial and agricultural sectors. His vocational education program for high school students was dropped, and his plan for sending existing agricultural institutions out to the land was ended. However, new agricultural or vocational institutions thereafter were located outside major cities. When new housing was built, much of it was in the form of high rises rather than Khrushchev&#x27;s low-rise structures.

Historian Robert Service summarizes Khrushchev&#x27;s contradictory personality traits:

[he was] at once a Stalinist and an anti-Stalinist, a communist believer and a cynic, a self-publicizing poltroon and a crusty philanthropist, a trouble-maker and a peacemaker, a stimulating colleague and a domineering boor, a statesman and a politicker who was out of his intellectual depth.

Some of Khrushchev&#x27;s agricultural projects were easily overturned. Corn became so unpopular in 1965 that its planting fell to the lowest level in the postwar period. Lysenko was stripped of his policy-making positions. However, the MTS stations remained closed, and the basic agricultural problems, which Khrushchev had tried to address, remained. While the Soviet standard of living increased greatly in the ten years after Khrushchev&#x27;s fall, much of the increase was due to industrial progress; agriculture continued to lag far behind, resulting in regular agricultural crises, especially in 1972 and 1975. Brezhnev and his successors continued Khrushchev&#x27;s precedent of buying grain from the West rather than suffer shortfalls and starvation. Neither Brezhnev nor his colleagues were personally popular, and the new government relied on authoritarian power. The government&#x27;s conservative tendencies would lead to the crushing of the &quot;Prague Spring&quot; of 1968.

Though Khrushchev&#x27;s strategy failed to achieve the major goals he sought, Aleksandr Fursenko, who wrote a book analyzing Khrushchev&#x27;s foreign and military policies, argued that the strategy did coerce the West in a limited manner. The agreement that the US would not invade Cuba has been adhered to. The refusal of the western world to acknowledge East Germany was gradually eroded, and, in 1975, the US and other NATO members signed the Helsinki Agreement with the USSR and Warsaw Pact nations.

The Russian public&#x27;s view of Khrushchev remains mixed. According to a major Russian pollster, the only eras of the 20th century that Russians in the 21st century evaluate positively are those under Nicholas II and under Khrushchev. A poll in 1998 of young Russians found that they felt Nicholas II had done more good than harm, and all other 20th-century Russian leaders more harm than good—except Khrushchev, about whom they were evenly divided. Khrushchev biographer William Tompson related the former premier&#x27;s reforms to those which occurred later:
Throughout the Brezhnev years and the lengthy interregnum that followed, the generation which had come of age during the &quot;first Russian spring&quot; of the 1950s awaited its turn in power. As Brezhnev and his colleagues died or were pensioned off, they were replaced by men and women for whom the Secret Speech and the first wave of de-Stalinization had been a formative experience, and these &quot;Children of Twentieth Congress&quot; took up the reins of power under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev and his colleagues. The Khrushchev era provided this second generation of reformers with both an inspiration and a cautionary tale.

<doc id="42559" wikidata="Q47228" url="?curid=42559" title="Kama Sutra">
<text>The Kama Sutra (; , , ; ) is an ancient Indian Hindu Sanskrit text on sexuality, eroticism and emotional fulfillment. Attributed to Vātsyāyana, the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; is neither exclusively nor predominantly a sex manual on sex positions, but rather a guide on the art of living well, the nature of love, finding partners, maintaining sex life, and other aspects pertaining to pleasure-oriented faculties. It is a &quot;sutra&quot;-genre text with terse aphoristic verses that have survived into the modern era with different s (commentaries). The text is a mix of prose and anustubh-meter poetry verses.

&quot;Kamasutra&quot; acknowledges the Hindu concept of purusharthas, and lists desire, sexuality, and emotional fulfillment as one of the proper goals of life. It discussed methods for courtship, training in the arts to be socially engaging, finding a partner, flirting, maintaining power in a married life, when and how to commit adultery, sexual positions, and other topics. The text majorly dealt with the philosophy and theory of love, what triggers desire, what sustains it, and how and when it is good or bad.

The text is one of many Indian texts on &quot;Kama Shastra&quot;. It is a much-translated work in Indian and non-Indian languages, and has influenced many secondary texts that followed since the 4th-century CE, as well as the Indian arts as exemplified by the pervasive presence of Kama-related reliefs and sculpture in old Hindu temples. Of these, the Khajuraho in Madhya Pradesh is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Among the surviving temple, one in Rajasthan has all the major chapters and sexual positions sculpted to illustrate the &quot;Kamasutra&quot;.

According to Wendy Doniger, the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; became &quot;one of the most pirated books in English language&quot; soon after it was published in 1883 by Richard Burton. This first European edition by Burton does not faithfully reflect much in the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; because he revised the collaborative translation by Bhagavanlal Indrajit and Shivaram Parashuram Bhide with Forster Arbuthnot to suit 19th-century Victorian tastes.

== Date and authorship ==

The original composition date or century for the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; is unknown. Historians have variously placed it between 400 BCE and 300 CE. According to John Keay, the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; is a compendium that was collected into its present form in the 2nd century CE. In contrast, the Indologist Wendy Doniger, who had co-translated the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; and published many papers on related Hindu texts, stated that the surviving version of the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; must have been revised or composed after 225 CE because it mentions the Abhiras and the Andhras, dynasties that did not co-rule major regions of ancient India before that year. The text makes no mention of the Gupta Empire, which ruled over major urban areas of ancient India, reshaping arts, culture, and economy from the 4th century through the 6th century CE. For these reasons, she dates the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; to the second half of the 3rd century CE. Doniger notes Kama Sutra was composed &quot;sometime in the third century of the common era, most likely in its second half, at the dawn of the Gupta Empire&quot;.

The place of its composition is also unclear. The likely candidates are urban centers of north India, alternatively in the eastern urban Pataliputra (now Patna). Vatsyayana Mallanaga is its widely accepted author because his name is embedded in the colophon verse, but little is known about him. Vatsyayana states that he wrote the text after much meditation. In the preface, Vatsyayana acknowledges that he is distilling many ancient texts, but these have not survived. He cites the work of others he calls &quot;teachers&quot; and &quot;scholars&quot;, and the longer texts by Auddalaki, Babhravya, Dattaka, Suvarnanabha, Ghotakamukha, Gonardiya, Gonikaputra, Charayana, and Kuchumara.

Kamasutra was considered to have been put together from a 150 chapter manuscript that had itself been distilled from 300 chapters which in turn came from a compilation of some 100,000 chapters of text. It was thought to have been written in its final form sometime between the third and fifth century CE.
Vatsyayana&#x27;s Kamasutra is mentioned and some verses quoted in the &quot;Brihatsamhita&quot; of Varahamihira, as well as the poems of Kalidasa. This suggests he lived before the 5th-century CE.

== Background ==
===Purusharthas===

The Hindu tradition has the concept of the &quot;Purusharthas&quot; which outlines &quot;four main goals of life&quot;. It holds that every human being has four proper goals that are necessary and sufficient for a fulfilling and happy life:
*Dharma – signifies behaviors that are considered to be in accord with &quot;rta&quot;, the order that makes life and universe possible, and includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and &quot;right way of living&quot;. Hindu dharma includes the religious duties, moral rights and duties of each individual, as well as behaviors that enable social order, right conduct, and those that are virtuous. Dharma, according to Van Buitenen, is that which all existing beings must accept and respect to sustain harmony and order in the world. It is, states Van Buitenen, the pursuit and execution of one&#x27;s nature and true calling, thus playing one&#x27;s role in cosmic concert.
*Artha – signifies the &quot;means of life&quot;, activities and resources that enables one to be in a state one wants to be in. &quot;Artha&quot; incorporates wealth, career, activity to make a living, financial security and economic prosperity. The proper pursuit of artha is considered an important aim of human life in Hinduism.
*Kama – signifies desire, wish, passion, emotions, pleasure of the senses, the aesthetic enjoyment of life, affection, or love, with or without sexual connotations. Gavin Flood explains kāma as &quot;love&quot; without violating dharma (moral responsibility), artha (material prosperity) and one&#x27;s journey towards moksha (spiritual liberation).
*Moksha – signifies emancipation, liberation or release. In some schools of Hinduism, &quot;moksha&quot; connotes freedom from &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, the cycle of death and rebirth, in other schools moksha connotes freedom, self-knowledge, self-realization and liberation in this life.

Each of these pursuits became a subject of study and led to prolific Sanskrit and some Prakrit languages literature in ancient India. Along with Dharmasastras, Arthasastras and Mokshasastras, the Kamasastras genre have been preserved in palm leaf manuscripts. The &quot;Kamasutra&quot; belongs to the Kamasastra genre of texts. Other examples of Hindu Sanskrit texts on sexuality and emotions include the &quot;Ratirahasya&quot; (called &quot;Kokashastra&quot; in some Indian scripts), the &quot;Anangaranga&quot;, the &quot;Nagarasarvasva&quot;, the &quot;Kandarpachudmani&quot;, and the &quot;Panchasayaka&quot;.

The defining object of the Indian Kamasastra literature, according to Laura Desmond – an anthropologist and a professor of Religious Studies, is the &quot;harmonious sensory experience&quot; from a good relationship between &quot;the self and the world&quot;, by discovering and enhancing sensory capabilities to &quot;affect and be affected by the world&quot;. Vatsyayana predominantly discusses Kama along with its relationship with Dharma and Artha. He makes a passing mention of Moksha in some verses.

===Vedic heritage===
The earliest foundations of the &quot;kamasutra&quot; are found in the Vedic era literature of Hinduism. Vatsyayana acknowledges this heritage in verse 1.1.9 of the text where he names Svetaketu Uddalaka as the &quot;first human author of the &quot;kamasutra&quot;&quot;. Uddalaka is an early Upanishadic rishi (scholar-poet, sage), whose ideas are found in the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; such as in section 6.2, and the &quot;Chandogya Upanishad&quot; such as over the verses 5.3 through 5.10. These Hindu scriptures are variously dated between 900 BCE and 700 BCE, according to the Indologist and Sanskrit scholar Patrick Olivelle. Among with other ideas such as Atman (self, soul) and the ontological concept of Brahman, these early Upanishads discuss human life, activities and the nature of existence as a form of internalized worship, where sexuality and sex is mapped into a form of religious &quot;yajna&quot; ritual (sacrificial fire, Agni) and suffused in spiritual terms:
&lt;poem&gt;
A fire – that is what a woman is, Gautama.
Her firewood is the vulva,
her smoke is the pubic hair,
her flame is the vagina,
when one penetrates her, that is her embers,
and her sparks are the climax.
In that very fire the gods offer semen,
and from that offering springs a man.
&lt;/poem&gt;
– &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; 6.2.13, , Trans.: Patrick Olivelle

According to the Indologist De, a view with which Doniger agrees, this is one of the many evidences that the &quot;kamasutra&quot; began in the religious literature of the Vedic era, ideas that were ultimately refined and distilled into a &quot;sutra&quot;-genre text by Vatsyayana. According to Doniger, this paradigm of celebrating pleasures, enjoyment and sexuality as a &quot;dharmic&quot; act began in the &quot;earthy, vibrant text known as the &quot;Rigveda&quot;&quot; of the Hindus. The &quot;Kamasutra&quot; and celebration of sex, eroticism and pleasure is an integral part of the religious milieu in Hinduism and quite prevalent in its temples.

===Epics===
Human relationships, sex and emotional fulfillment are a significant part of the post-Vedic Sanskrit literature such as the major Hindu epics: the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. The ancient Indian view has been, states Johann Meyer, that love and sex are a delightful necessity. Though she is reserved and selective, &quot;a woman stands in very great need of &quot;surata&quot; (amorous or sexual pleasure)&quot;, and &quot;the woman has a far stronger erotic disposition, her delight in the sexual act is greater than a man&#x27;s&quot;.

==Manuscripts==

The &quot;Kamasutra&quot; manuscripts have survived in many versions across the Indian subcontinent. While attempting to get a translation of the Sanskrit kama-sastra text &quot;Ananga Ranga&quot;, which had already been widely translated by the Hindus in their regional languages such as Marathi, associates of the British Orientalist Richard Burton, stumbled into portions of the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; manuscript. Burton then commissioned the Sanskrit scholar Bhagvanlal Indraji to locate a complete &quot;Kamasutra&quot; manuscript and translate it. Indraji collected variant manuscripts of the text in libraries and temples of Varanasi, Kolkata and Jaipur. Burton later published an edited English translation of these manuscripts, but not a critical edition of the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; in Sanskrit.

According to S.C. Upadhyaya, known for his 1961 scholarly study and a more accurate translation of the &quot;Kamasutra&quot;, there are issues with the manuscripts that have survived and the text likely underwent revisions over time. This is confirmed by other 1st-millennium CE Hindu texts on &quot;kama&quot; that mention and cite the &quot;Kamasutra&quot;, but some of these quotations credited to the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; by these historic authors &quot;are not to be found in the text of the Kamasutra&quot; that have survived.

== Structure ==
Vatsyayana&#x27;s &quot;Kamasutra&quot; states it has 1,250 verses distributed over 36 chapters in 64 sections organised into 7 books. This statement is included in the opening chapter, a common practice in ancient Hindu texts, likely to prevent major and unauthorized expansions of a popular text. The text that has survived into the modern era has 67 sections, and this list is enumerated in Book 7 and in Yashodhara&#x27;s Sanskrit commentary (&quot;bhasya&quot;) on the text.

The &quot;Kamasutra&quot; uses a mixture of prose and poetry, and the narration has the form of a dramatic fiction where two characters called &quot;nayaka&quot; (man) and &quot;nayika&quot; (woman), are aided by the characters called &quot;pitamarda&quot; (libertine), &quot;vita&quot; (pander) and &quot;vidushaka&quot; (jester). This format follows the teachings found in the Sanskrit classic &quot;Natyasastra&quot;. The teachings and discussions found in the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; extensively incorporate ancient Hindu mythology and legends.

==Contents==
The &quot;Kamasutra&quot; is a &quot;sutra&quot;-genre text consisting of intensely condensed, aphoristic verses. Doniger describes them as a &quot;kind of atomic string (thread) of meanings&quot;, which are so cryptic that any translation is more like deciphering and filling in the text. Condensing a text into a sutra-genre religious text form makes it easier to remember and transmit, but it also introduces ambiguity and the need to understand the context of each chapter, its philological roots, as well as the prior literature, states Doniger. However, this method of knowledge preservation and transmission has its foundation in the Vedas, which themselves are cryptic and require a commentator and teacher-guide to comprehend the details and the inter-relationship of the ideas. The &quot;Kamasutra&quot; too has attracted commentaries, of which the most well known are those of 12th-century or 13th-century Yaśodhara&#x27;s &quot;Jayamaṅgalā&quot; in the Sanskrit language, and of Devadatta Shastri who commented on the original text as well as its commentaries in the Hindi language. There are many other Sanskrit commentaries on the &quot;Kamasutra&quot;, such as the &quot;Sutra Vritti&quot; by Narsingha Sastri. These commentaries cite and quote Hindu texts such as the &quot;Upanishads&quot;, the &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, the &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, the &quot;Manusmriti&quot;, the &quot;Nyayasutra&quot;, the &quot;Markandeya Purana&quot;, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the &quot;Nitishastra&quot; and others to provide the context, per the norms of its literary traditions. The extant translations of the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; typically incorporate these commentaries, states Daniélou.

In the colonial era marked by sexual censorship, the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; became famous as a pirated and underground text for its explicit description of sex positions. The stereotypical image of the text is one where erotic pursuit with sexual intercourse include improbable contortionist forms. In reality, according to Doniger, the &quot;real Kamasutra&quot; is much more and is a book about &quot;the art of living&quot;, about understanding one&#x27;s body and a partner&#x27;s body, finding a partner and emotional connection, marriage, the power equation over time in intimate relationships, the nature of adultery and drugs (aphrodisiacs) along with many simple to complex variations in sex positions to explore. It is also a psychological treatise that presents the effect of desire and pleasure on human behavior.

For each aspect of &quot;Kama&quot;, the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; presents a diverse spectrum of options and regional practices. According to Shastri, as quoted by Doniger, the text analyses &quot;the inclinations of men, good and bad&quot;, thereafter it presents Vatsyayana&#x27;s recommendation and arguments of what one must avoid as well as what to not miss in experiencing and enjoying, with &quot;acting only on the good&quot;. For example, the text discusses adultery but recommends a faithful spousal relationship. The approach of &quot;Kamasutra&quot; is not to ignore nor deny the psychology and complexity of human behavior for pleasure and sex. The text, according to Doniger, clearly states &quot;that a treatise demands the inclusion of everything, good or bad&quot;, but after being informed with in-depth knowledge, one must &quot;reflect and accept only the good&quot;. The approach found in the text is one where goals of science and religion should not be to repress, but to encyclopedically know and understand, thereafter let the individual decide. The text states that it aims to be comprehensive and inclusive of diverse views and lifestyles.

===Flirting and courtship===
The 3rd-century text includes a number of themes, including subjects such as flirting that resonate in the modern era context, states a &quot;New York Times&quot; review. For example, it suggests that a young man seeking to attract a woman, should hold a party, and invite the guests to recite poetry. In the party, a poem should be read with parts missing, and the guests should compete to creatively complete the poem. As another example, the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; suggests that the boy and the girl should go play together, such as swim in a river. The boy should dive into the water away from the girl he is interested in, then swim underwater to get close to her, emerge from the water and surprise her, touch her slightly and then dive again, away from her.

Book 3 of the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; is largely dedicated to the art of courtship with the aim of marriage. The book&#x27;s opening verse declares marriage to be a conducive means to &quot;a pure and natural love between the partners&quot;, states Upadhyaya. It leads to emotional fulfillment in many forms such as more friends for both, relatives, progeny, amorous and sexual relationship between the couple, and the conjugal pursuit of &quot;dharma&quot; (spiritual and ethical life) and &quot;artha&quot; (economic life). The first three chapters discuss how a man should go about finding the right bride, while the fourth offers equivalent discussion for a woman and how she can get the man she wants. The text states that a person should be realistic, and must possess the &quot;same qualities which one expects from the partner&quot;. It suggests involving one&#x27;s friends and relatives in the search, and meeting the current friends and relatives of one&#x27;s future partner prior to the marriage. While the original text makes no mention of astrology and horoscopes, later commentaries, such as one by 13th-century Yashodhara includes consulting and comparing the compatibility of the horoscopes, omens, planetary alignments, and such signs prior to proposing a marriage. Vatsyayana recommends, states Alain Danielou, that &quot;one should play, marry, associate with one&#x27;s equals, people of one&#x27;s own circle&quot; who share the same values and religious outlook. It is more difficult to manage a good, happy relationship when there are basic differences between the two, according to verse 3.1.20 of the &quot;Kamasutra&quot;.

===Intimacy and foreplay===
Vatsyayana&#x27;s &quot;Kamasutra&quot; describes intimacy of various forms, including those between lovers before and during sex. For example, the text discusses eight forms of &quot;alingana&quot; (embrace) in verses 2.2.7–23: &quot;sphrishtaka&quot;, &quot;viddhaka&quot;, &quot;udghrishtaka&quot;, &quot;piditaka&quot;, &quot;lataveshtitaka&quot;, &quot;vrikshadhirudha&quot;, &quot;tilatandula&quot; and &quot;kshiranira&quot;. The first four are expressive of mutual love, but are nonsexual. The last four are forms of embrace recommended by Vatsyayana to increase pleasure during foreplay and during sexual intimacy. Vatsyayana cites earlier – now lost – Indian texts from the Babhraya&#x27;s school, for these eight categories of embraces. The various forms of intimacy reflect the intent and provide means to engage a combination of senses for pleasure. For instance, according to Vatsyayana the &quot;lalatika&quot; form enables both to feel each other and allows the man to visually appreciate &quot;the full beauty of the female form&quot;, states S.C. Upadhyaya.
Another example of the forms of intimacy discussed in the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; includes &quot;chumbanas&quot; (kissing). The text presents twenty-six forms of kisses, ranging from those appropriate for showing respect and affection, to those during foreplay and sex. Vatsyayana also mentions variations in kissing cultures in different parts of ancient India. The best kiss for an intimate partner, according to &quot;kamasutra&quot;, is one that is based on the awareness of the &quot;avastha&quot; (the emotional state of one&#x27;s partner) when the two are not in a sexual union. During sex, the text recommends going with the flow and mirroring with &quot;abhiyoga&quot; and &quot;samprayoga&quot;.

Other techniques of foreplay and sexual intimacy that are described in the &quot;kamasutra&quot; include; various forms of holding and embraces (&quot;grahana&quot;, &quot;upaguhana&quot;), mutual massage and rubbing (&quot;mardana&quot;), pinching and biting, using fingers and hands to stimulate (&quot;karikarakrida&quot;, &quot;nadi-kshobana&quot;, &quot;anguli-pravesha&quot;), three styles of &quot;jihva-pravesha&quot; (french kissing), and many styles of fellatio and cunnilingus.

===Adultery===
The &quot;Kamasutra&quot;, states the Indologist and Sanskrit literature scholar Ludo Rocher, discourages adultery but then devotes &quot;not less than fifteen sutras (1.5.6–20) to enumerating the reasons (&quot;karana&quot;) for which a man is allowed to seduce a married woman&quot;. Vatsyayana mentions different types of &quot;nayikas&quot; (urban girls) such as unmarried virgins, those married and abandoned by husband, widow seeking remarriage and courtesans, then discusses their kama/sexual education, rights and mores. In childhood, Vātsyāyana says, a person should learn how to make a living; youth is the time for pleasure, and as years pass, one should concentrate on living virtuously and hope to escape the cycle of rebirth.

According to Doniger, the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; teaches adulterous sexual liaison as a means for a man to predispose the involved woman in assisting him, as a strategic means to work against his enemies and to facilitate his successes. It also explains the signs and reasons a woman wants to enter into an adulterous relationship and when she does not want to commit adultery. The &quot;Kamasutra&quot; teaches strategies to engage in adulterous relationships, but concludes its chapter on sexual liaison stating that one should not commit adultery because adultery pleases only one of two sides in a marriage, hurts the other, it goes against both &quot;dharma&quot; and &quot;artha&quot;.

===Caste, class===
The &quot;Kamasutra&quot; has been one of the unique sources of sociological information and cultural milieu of ancient India. It shows a &quot;near total disregard of class (varna) and caste (jati)&quot;, states Doniger. Human relationships, including the sexual type, are neither segregated nor repressed by gender or caste, rather linked to individual&#x27;s wealth (success in &quot;artha&quot;). In the &quot;Kamasutra&quot;, lovers are &quot;not upper-class&quot; but they &quot;must be rich&quot; enough to dress well, pursue social leisure activities, buy gifts and surprise the lover. In the rare mention of caste, it is about a man finding his legal wife and the advice that humorous stories to seduce a woman should be about &quot;other virgins of same &quot;jati&quot; (caste)&quot;. In general, the text describes sexual activity between men and women across class and caste, both in urban and rural settings.

===Same-sex relationships===
The &quot;Kamasutra&quot; includes verses describing homosexual relations such as oral sex between two men, as well as between two women. Lesbian relations are extensively covered in Chapters 5 and 8 in Book 2. The text also mentions &quot;pretend play&quot;, sadomasochism, and group sex.

According to Doniger, the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; discusses same-sex relationships through the notion of the &quot;tritiya prakriti&quot;, literally, &quot;third sexuality&quot; or &quot;third nature&quot;. In &quot;Redeeming the Kamasutra,&quot; Doniger states that &quot;the Kamasutra departs from the dharmic view of homosexuality in significant ways&quot;, where the term &quot;kliba&quot; appears. In contemporary translations, this has been inaccurately rendered as &quot;eunuch&quot; – or, a castrated man in a harem, and the royal harem did not exist in India before the Turkish presence in the ninth century. The Sanskrit word &quot;Kliba&quot; found in older Indian texts refers to a &quot;man who does not act like a man&quot;, typically in a pejorative sense. The &quot;Kamasutra&quot; does not use the pejorative term &quot;kliba&quot; at all, but speaks instead of a &quot;third nature&quot; or, in the sexual behavior context as the &quot;third sexuality&quot;.

The text states that there are two sorts of &quot;third nature&quot;, one where a man behaves like a woman, and in the other, a woman behaves like a man. In one of the longest consecutive sets of verses describing a sexual act, the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; describes fellatio technique between a man dressed like a woman performing fellatio on another man. The text also mentions same-sex behavior between two women, such as a girl losing her virginity with a girlfriend as they use their fingers, as well as oral sex and the use of sex toys between women. &quot;Svairini&quot;, a term Danielou translates as a lesbian, is described in the text as a woman who lives a conjugal life with another woman or by herself fending for herself, not interested in a husband. Additionally, the text has some fleeting remarks on bisexual relationships.

== Translations ==
According to Doniger, the historical records suggest that the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; was a well-known and popular text in Indian history. This popularity through the Mughal Empire era is confirmed by its regional translations. The Mughals, states Doniger, had &quot;commissioned lavishly illustrated Persian and Sanskrit &quot;Kamasutra&quot; manuscripts&quot;.

The first English translation of the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; was privately printed in 1883 by the Orientalist Sir Richard Francis Burton. He did not translate it, but did edit it to suit the Victorian British attitudes. The unedited translation was produced by the Indian scholar Bhagwan Lal Indraji with the assistance of a student Shivaram Parshuram Bhide, under the guidance of Burton&#x27;s friend, the Indian civil servant Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot. According to Doniger, the Burton version is a &quot;flawed English translation&quot; but influential as modern translators and abridged versions, even in the Indian languages such as in Hindi, are re-translations of the Burton version, rather than the original Sanskrit manuscript.

The Burton version of the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; was produced in an environment where the Victorian mindset and Protestant proselytizers were busy finding faults and attacking Hinduism and its culture, rejecting as &quot;filthy paganism&quot; anything they found sensuous and sexual in Hindu arts and literature. The &quot;Hindus were cowering under their scorn&quot;, states Doniger, and the open discussion of sex in the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; scandalized the 19th-century Europeans. The Burton edition of the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; was illegal to publish in England and the United States till 1962. Yet, states Doniger, it became soon after its publication in 1883, &quot;one of the most pirated books in the English language&quot;, widely copied, reprinted and republished sometimes without Richard Burton&#x27;s name.

Burton made two important contributions to the &quot;Kamasutra&quot;. First, he had the courage to publish it in the colonial era against the political and cultural mores of the British elite. He creatively found a way to subvert the then prevalent censorship laws of Britain under the Obscene Publications Act of 1857. Burton created a fake publishing house named &quot;The Kama Shastra Society of London and Benares&quot; (Benares = Varanasi), with the declaration that it is &quot;for private circulation only&quot;. The second major contribution was to edit it in a major way, by changing words and rewriting sections to make it more acceptable to the general British public. For example, the original Sanskrit &quot;Kamasutra&quot; does not use the words lingam or yoni for sexual organs, and almost always uses other terms. Burton adroitly avoided being viewed as obscene to the Victorian mindset by avoiding the use of words such as penis, vulva, vagina and other direct or indirect sexual terms in the Sanskrit text to discuss sex, sexual relationships and human sexual positions. Burton used the terms lingam and yoni instead throughout the translation. This conscious and incorrect word substitution, states Doniger, thus served as an Orientalist means to &quot;anthropologize sex, distance it, make it safe for English readers by assuring them, or pretending to assure them, that the text was not about real sexual organs, their sexual organs, but merely about the appendages of weird, dark people far away.&quot; Though Burton used the terms lingam and yoni for human sexual organs, terms that actually mean a lot more in Sanskrit texts and its meaning depends on the context. However, Burton&#x27;s &quot;Kamasutra&quot; gave a unique, specific meaning to these words in the western imagination.

The problems with Burton mistranslation are many, states Doniger. First, the text &quot;simply does not say what Burton says it says&quot;. Second, it &quot;robs women of their voices, turning direct quotes into indirect quotes, thus losing the force of the dialogue that animates the work and erasing the vivid presence of the many women who speak in the Kamasutra&quot;. Third, it changes the force of words in the original text. For example, when a woman says &quot;Stop!&quot; or &quot;Let me go!&quot; in the original text of Vatsyayana, Burton changed it to &quot;She continually utters words expressive of prohibition, sufficiency, or desire of liberation&quot;, states Doniger, and thus misconstrues the context and intent of the original text. Similarly, while the original &quot;Kamasutra&quot; acknowledges that &quot;women have strong privileges&quot;, Burton erased these passages and thus eroded women&#x27;s agency in ancient India in the typical Orientialist manner that dehumanized the Indian culture. David Shulman, a professor of Indian Studies and Comparative Religion, agrees with Doniger that the Burton translation is misguided and flawed. The Burton version was written with a different mindset, one that treated &quot;sexual matters with Victorian squeamishness and a pornographic delight in the indirect&quot;, according to Shulman. It has led to a misunderstanding of the text and created the wrong impression of it being ancient &quot;Hindu pornography&quot;.

In 1961, S. C. Upadhyaya published his translation as the &quot;Kamasutra of Vatsyayana: Complete Translation from the Original&quot;. According to Jyoti Puri, it is considered among the best-known scholarly English-language translations of the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; in post-independent India.

Other translations include those by Alain Daniélou (&quot;The Complete Kama Sutra&quot; in 1994). This translation, originally into French, and thence into English, featured the original text attributed to Vatsyayana, along with a medieval and a modern commentary. Unlike the 1883 version, Daniélou&#x27;s new translation preserves the numbered verse divisions of the original, and does not incorporate notes in the text. He includes English translations of two important commentaries, one by Jayamangala, and a more modern commentary by Devadatta Shastri, as endnotes. Doniger questions the accuracy of Daniélou&#x27;s translation, stating that he has freely reinterpreted the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; while disregarding the gender that is implicit in the Sanskrit words. He, at times, reverses the object and subject, making the woman the subject and man the object when the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; is explicitly stating the reverse. According to Doniger, &quot;even this cryptic text [&quot;Kamasutra&quot;] is not infinitely elastic&quot; and such creative reinterpretations do not reflect the text.

A translation by Indra Sinha was published in 1980. In the early 1990s, its chapter on sexual positions began circulating on the Internet as an independent text and today is often assumed to be the whole of the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot;.

Doniger and Sudhir Kakar published another translation in 2002, as a part of the Oxford World&#x27;s Classics series. Along with the translation, Doniger has published numerous articles and book chapters relating to the &quot;Kamasutra&quot;. The Doniger translation and &quot;Kamasutra&quot;-related literature has both been praised and criticized. According to David Shulman, the Doniger translation &quot;will change peoples&#x27; understanding of this book and of ancient India. Previous translations are hopelessly outdated, inadequate and misguided&quot;. Narasingha Sil calls the Doniger&#x27;s work as &quot;another signature work of translation and exegesis of the much misunderstood and abused Hindu erotology&quot;. Her translation has the folksy, &quot;twinkle prose&quot;, engaging style, and an original translation of the Sanskrit text. However, adds Sil, Doniger&#x27;s work mixes her postmodern translation and interpretation of the text with her own &quot;political and polemical&quot; views. She makes sweeping generalizations and flippant insertions that are supported by neither the original text nor the weight of evidence in other related ancient and later Indian literature such as from the Bengal Renaissance movement – one of the scholarly specialty of Narasingha Sil. Doniger&#x27;s presentation style titillates, yet some details misinform and parts of her interpretations are dubious, states Sil.

==Analysis==
Indira Kapoor, a director of the International Planned Parenthood Foundation, states that the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; is a treatise on human sexual behavior and an ancient attempt to seriously study sexuality among other things. According to Kapoor, quotes Jyoti Puri, the attitude of contemporary Indians is markedly different, with misconceptions and expressions of embarrassment, rather than curiosity and pride, when faced with texts such as &quot;Kamasutra&quot; and amorous and erotic arts found in Hindu temples. &quot;Kamasutra&quot;, states Kapoor, must be viewed as a means to discover and improve the &quot;self-confidence and understanding of their bodies and feelings&quot;.

The &quot;Kamasutra&quot; has been a popular reference to erotic ancient literature. In the Western media, such as in the American women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Redbook&quot;, the Kamasutra is described as &quot;Although it was written centuries ago, there&#x27;s still no better sex handbook, which details hundreds of positions, each offering a subtle variation in pleasure to men and women.&quot;

Jyoti Puri, who published a review and feminist critique of the text, stated that the &quot;&quot;Kamasutra&quot; is frequently appropriated as indisputable evidence of a non-Western and tolerant, indeed celebratory, view of sexuality&quot; and for &quot;the belief that the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; provides a transparent glimpse into the positive, even exalted, view of sexuality&quot;. However, according to Puri, this is a colonial and anticolonial modernist interpretation of the text. These narratives neither resonate with nor provide the &quot;politics of gender, race, nationality and class&quot; that may have been prevalent in ancient India as published by other historians .

According to Doniger, the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; is a &quot;great cultural masterpiece&quot;, one which can inspire contemporary Indians to overcome &quot;self-doubts and rejoice&quot; in their ancient heritage.

<text>David Arkenstone (born July 1, 1952) is an American composer and performer. His music is primarily instrumental, with occasional vocalizations. Most of Arkenstone&#x27;s music falls into new age category; however, he also worked in other genres, including even a heavy metal soundtrack for &quot;&quot; video game. His music has been described as &#x27;soundtracks for the imagination&#x27;. Throughout his career, Arkenstone released over 50 albums and composed music for video games, including &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, and for television, including NBC&#x27;s Kentucky Derby. Arkenstone has been nominated for Grammy Awards five times.

== Biography ==

After moving from Chicago to California at the age of ten, he was involved in various high school bands playing guitars and keyboards, playing baseball in his spare time. He studied music in college and started a progressive rock band named after himself, but he soon discovered his own musical voice in the instrumental genre. Arkenstone was influenced by writers such as J. R. R. Tolkien and Ian Fleming, and grew up listening to bands like Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Deep Purple, and Yes, as well as listening to classical music.

Arkenstone went solo and found his own sound in New Age music. He says that has been greatly aided by technology: &quot;Technology has produced some wonderful tools for making music. The computer allows me to fully orchestrate my pieces and really fine tune them&quot;. His music is primarily instrumental. His albums, typically fantasy themed, often come packaged with literature and art. He worked with fantasy novel writer Mercedes Lackey on a few of her albums. Arkenstone and his ex-wife Diane created their own record label called Neo Pacifica. In addition to releasing their own music on the label, they have included other bands such as Earth Trybe, Enaid, and the Marquis Ensemble.

He has also composed music for television; channels such as the History Channel, the Discovery Channel and NBC Sports include his music. He has also written music for trailers and film soundtracks, including the independent film &quot;PRISM&quot;, as well as computer game soundtracks such as &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, &quot;Lands of Lore 2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;, &quot;Earth and Beyond&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Space Siege&quot;. He also features on &quot;20 Years of Narada Piano&quot;.

Arkenstone has earned five Grammy nominations for his work: &quot;In the Wake of the Wind&quot; in 1992, &quot;Citizen of the World&quot; in 2000, &quot;Atlantis&quot; in 2004,&quot;Fairy Dreams&quot; in 2020, and &quot;Pangaea&quot; in 2022.

Arkenstone has learned to play a variety of musical instruments, including bouzouki, mandolin, guitar, bass guitar, harp, cello, flute, electronic keyboards, piano, Turkish saz, pennywhistle, melodica, and pan pipes. He also plays drums and percussion and has performed some vocalizations on his albums.

Arkenstone is also involved in the band Troika; their sound is similar to his solo work. The band members like to remain anonymous, although the compositions are credited to Arkenstone.

His theme &quot;The Journey Begins/Kyla&#x27;s Ride&quot; was used for the FIFA World Cup France &#x27;98 broadcastings intro by the Mexican television network Azteca.

His song &quot;Papillon (On the Wings of the Butterfly)&quot; was formerly used as background music in Future World at Epcot in Walt Disney World. His song &quot;The Palace&quot; was once used as background music in Tomorrowland at the Magic Kingdom as well. &quot;The Palace&quot; also used to play in Tokyo Disneyland&#x27;s Tomorrowland, and another one of his songs, &quot;Valley in the Clouds&quot; was also used.

He signed with Domo Records and re-released the album &quot;Echoes of Light and Shadow&quot; in 2010.

Arkenstone was a member of the composing team who developed the music for Blizzard Activision&#x27;s &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; videogame&#x27;s&quot; Cataclysm&quot; expansion. Along with Arkenstone, the team consists of Derek Duke, Glenn Stafford, and Neal Acree.

<text>Tangerine Dream is a German electronic music band founded in 1967 by Edgar Froese. The group has seen many personnel changes over the years, with Froese the only constant member until his death in January 2015. The best-known lineup of the group was its mid-1970s trio of Froese, Christopher Franke, and Peter Baumann. In 1979, Johannes Schmoelling replaced Baumann until his own departure in 1985. This lineup was notable for composing many movie soundtracks. Since Froese&#x27;s death in 2015, the group has been under the leadership of Thorsten Quaeschning. Quaeschning is Froese&#x27;s chosen successor and is currently the longest-serving band member, having joined in 2005. Quaeschning is currently joined by violinist Hoshiko Yamane who joined in 2011 and Paul Frick who joined in 2020. Prior to this Quaeschning and Yamane performed with Ulrich Schnauss from 2014 to 2020. Schnauss only played two shows with Froese in November 2014 before Froese&#x27;s passing.

Tangerine Dream are considered a pioneering act in electronica. Their work with the electronic music Ohr label produced albums that had a pivotal role in the development of the German musical scene known as kosmische Musik (&quot;cosmic music&quot;). Their &quot;Virgin Years&quot;, so called because of their association with Virgin Records, produced albums that further explored synthesizers and sequencers, including the UK top 20 albums &quot;Phaedra&quot; (1974) and &quot;Rubycon&quot; (1975). The group also had a successful career composing film soundtracks, creating over 60 scores.

From the late 1990s into the 2000s, Tangerine Dream continued to explore other styles of instrumental music as well as electronica. Their recorded output has been prolific, including over one hundred albums. Among other scoring projects, they helped create the soundtrack for the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;. Their mid-1970s work has been profoundly influential in the development of electronic music styles such as new-age and electronic dance music.

On 29 September 2017, the band released an all-new music studio album entitled &quot;Quantum Gate&quot;. In December 2019, they released &quot;Recurring Dreams&quot;, a compilation of new recordings of some of the band&#x27;s classic compositions. On 26 November 2021, the band released an EP entitled &quot;Probe 6–8&quot; (including three tracks: &quot;Raum&quot;, &quot;Para Guy&quot; and &quot;Continuum&quot;), whose concept was developed further on their following album &quot;Raum&quot;, their latest studio album to date which was released on 25 February 2022.

==History==
===Origins: psychedelia and krautrock===
Edgar Froese arrived in West Berlin in the mid-1960s to study art. His first band, the psychedelic rock-styled &quot;The Ones&quot;, disbanded after releasing only one single. After The Ones, Froese experimented with musical ideas, playing smaller gigs with a variety of musicians. Most of these performances were in the famous Zodiak Free Arts Lab, although one grouping also had the distinction of being invited to play for the surrealist painter Salvador Dalí. The music was partnered with literature, painting, early forms of multimedia, and more. It seemed as though only the most outlandish ideas attracted any attention, leading Froese to comment: &quot;In the absurd often lies what is artistically possible.&quot; As members of the group came and went, the direction of the music continued to be inspired by the Surrealists, and the group came to be called by the surreal-sounding name of Tangerine Dream, inspired by mishearing the line &quot;tangerine trees and marmalade skies&quot; from the Beatles&#x27; track &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;.

Froese was fascinated by technology and skilled in using it to create music. He built custom-made instruments and, wherever he went, collected sounds with tape recorders for use in constructing musical works later. His early work with tape loops and other repeating sounds was the obvious precursor to the emerging technology of the sequencer, which Tangerine Dream quickly adopted upon its arrival.

Released in 1970 by record label Ohr, the first Tangerine Dream album, &quot;Electronic Meditation&quot;, was a tape-collage Krautrock piece, using the technology of the time rather than the synthesized music they later became famous for. The line-up for the album was Froese, Klaus Schulze, and Conrad Schnitzler. &quot;Electronic Meditation&quot; began the period known as the &quot;Pink Years&quot; (the Ohr logo was a pink ear). Subsequent albums, beginning with &quot;Alpha Centauri&quot;, relied heavily on electronic instruments. The band&#x27;s music during the early 1970s prominently featured organ from Steve Schroyder (on &quot;Alpha Centauri&quot;) or Peter Baumann (on subsequent releases), commonly augmented by guitar from Froese and drums from Christopher Franke. They also started their heavy usage of the Mellotron during this period.

===Rise to fame: the Virgin years===
The band&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Atem&quot; was named as one of British DJ John Peel&#x27;s records of the year, and this attention helped Tangerine Dream to sign to the fledgling Virgin Records in the same year. Soon afterward they released the album &quot;Phaedra&quot;, an eerie soundscape that unexpectedly reached No. 15 in the UK Albums Chart and became one of Virgin&#x27;s first bona fide hits. &quot;Phaedra&quot; was one of the first commercial albums to feature sequencers and came to define much more than just the band&#x27;s own sound. The creation of the album&#x27;s title track was something of an accident: the band was experimenting in the studio with a recently acquired Moog synthesizer, and the tape happened to be rolling at the time. They kept the results and later added recorder, bass guitar, and Mellotron performances. The Moog, like many other early synthesizers, was so sensitive to changes in temperature that its oscillators would drift badly in tuning as the equipment warmed up, and this drift can easily be heard on the final recording. This album marked the beginning of the period known as the &#x27;Virgin Years&#x27;.

Their mid-1970s work has been profoundly influential in the development of electronic music styles such as new-age (although the band themselves disliked the term) and electronic dance music.

In the 1980s, along with other electronic music pioneers such as Jean-Michel Jarre (with whom Edgar Froese collaborated on Jarre&#x27;s 2015 album &quot;Electronica 1: The Time Machine&quot;) and Vangelis, the band were early adopters of the new digital technology, which revolutionized the sound of the synthesizer, although the group had been using digital equipment (in some shape or form) as early as the mid-1970s. Their technical competence and extensive experience in their early years with self-made instruments and unusual means of creating sounds meant that they were able to exploit this new technology to make music quite unlike anything heard before.

===Tangerine Dream live===
Tangerine Dream&#x27;s earliest concerts were visually simple by modern standards, with three men sitting motionless for hours alongside massive electronic boxes festooned with patch cords and a few flashing lights. Some concerts were even performed in complete darkness, as happened during the performance at York Minster on 20 October 1975. As time went on and technology advanced, the concerts became much more elaborate, with visual effects, lighting, lasers, pyrotechnics, and projected images. By 1977 their North American tour featured full-scale Laserium effects.

Through the 1970s and 1980s, the band toured extensively. The concerts generally included large amounts of unreleased and improvised material and were consequently widely bootlegged. They were notorious for playing extremely loudly and for a long time. The band released recordings of a fair number of their concerts, and on some of these the band worked out material that would later form the backbone of their studio recordings.

===Forays into vocals===

Most of Tangerine Dream&#x27;s albums are entirely instrumental. Two earlier albums that prominently featured lyrics were &quot;Cyclone&quot; (1978) and &quot;Tyger&quot; (1987). While there were occasionally a few vocals on the band&#x27;s other releases, such as the track &quot;Kiew Mission&quot; from 1981&#x27;s &quot;Exit&quot; and &quot;The Harbor&quot; from 1987&#x27;s &quot;Shy People&quot;, the group only returned to featuring vocals on a larger scale in a musical trilogy based on Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. This was followed by a 2007 album &quot;Madcap&#x27;s Flaming Duty&quot; and a 2010 cover collection &quot;Under Cover – Chapter One&quot;.

After their 1980 East Berlin gig, when they became one of the first major Western bands to perform in a communist country, Tangerine Dream released a double live album of one of their performances there, called &quot;Poland&quot;, recorded during their tour in the winter at the end of 1983. With &quot;Poland&quot;, the band moved to the Jive Electro label, marking the beginning of the &quot;Blue Years&quot;.

===Soundtracks===
Throughout the 1980s, Tangerine Dream composed scores for more than 20 films. This had been an interest of Froese&#x27;s since the late 1960s, when he scored and acted in the experimental film &quot;Auf Scheißer schießt man nicht&quot;, directed by Hansjürgen Pohland. Many of the group&#x27;s soundtracks were composed at least partially of reworked material from the band&#x27;s studio albums or work that was in progress for upcoming albums; see, for example, the resemblance between the track &quot;Igneous&quot; on their soundtrack for &quot;Thief&quot; and the track &quot;Thru Metamorphic Rocks&quot; on their studio release &quot;Force Majeure&quot;. Their first exposure on US television came when a track for the then in-progress album &quot;Le Parc&quot; was used as the theme for the television program, &quot;Street Hawk&quot;. Some of the more famous soundtracks have been &quot;Sorcerer&quot;, &quot;Thief&quot;, &quot;Legend&quot;, &quot;Risky Business&quot;, &quot;The Keep&quot;, &quot;Firestarter&quot;, &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, &quot;Heartbreakers&quot;, &quot;Shy People&quot; and &quot;Near Dark&quot;.

Tangerine Dream also composed 35 hours of music stems for the video game, &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;.

In 2016, Tangerine Dream released their own version of the theme music for the television series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;. Tangerine Dream had inspired music for the series.

===Going independent===
Several of the band&#x27;s albums released during the 1990s were nominated for Grammy Awards. Since then, Tangerine Dream with Jerome Froese took a directional change away from the new-age leanings of those albums and toward an electronica style. After Jerome&#x27;s departure, founder Edgar Froese steered the band in a direction somewhat reminiscent of material throughout their career.

In later years, Tangerine Dream released albums in series. The &quot;Dream Mixes&quot; series began in 1995 with the last being released in 2010. The &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; series, based on the writings of Dante Alighieri, spanned 2002–2006. From 2007 to 2010, the &quot;Five Atomic Seasons&quot; were released. Most recently, the &quot;Eastgate Sonic Poems&quot; series, based on the works of famous poetic authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and Franz Kafka, began in 2011, with the last appearing in 2013. Also, beginning in 2007, Tangerine Dream released a number of EPs, referred to as &quot;CupDiscs&quot; by the band.

Edgar Froese also released a number of solo recordings, which are similar in style to Tangerine Dream&#x27;s work. Jerome Froese released a number of singles as TDJ Rome, which are similar to his work within the &quot;Dream Mixes&quot; series. In 2005, he released his first solo album &quot;Neptunes&quot; under the name Jerome Froese. In 2006, Jerome left Tangerine Dream to concentrate on his solo career. His second solo album &quot;Shiver Me Timbers&quot; was released on 29 October 2007, and his third, &quot;Far Side of the Face&quot;, was released in 2012. Beginning in 2011, Jerome Froese joined with former Tangerine Dream member Johannes Schmoelling and keyboardist Robert Waters to form the band Loom, which plays original material, as well as Tangerine Dream classics. Thorsten Quaeschning, leader of Picture Palace Music, was brought into Tangerine Dream in 2005 and contributed to most of the band&#x27;s albums and CupDiscs since then.

The group had recording contracts with Ohr, Virgin, Jive Electro, Private Music, and Miramar, and many of the minor soundtracks were released on Varèse Sarabande. In 1996, the band founded their own record label, TDI, and more recently, Eastgate. Subsequent albums are today generally not available in normal retail channels but are sold by mail-order or through online channels. The same applies to their Miramar releases, the rights to which the band bought back. Meanwhile, their Ohr and Jive Electro catalogs (known as the &quot;Pink&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; Years) are currently owned by Esoteric Recordings. 

Since 2017, Tangerine Dream has been signed to the independent label Kscope, which has released their studio albums Quantum Gate, Recurring Dreams and Raum.

===Concert updates===

To celebrate their 40th anniversary (1967–2007), Tangerine Dream announced their only UK concert: at London Astoria on 20 April 2007. The band also played a totally free open-air concert in Eberswalde on 1 July 2007 and at the Alte Oper in Frankfurt on Main on 7 October 2007. 2008 saw the band in Eindhoven Netherlands playing at E-Day (an electronic music festival); later in the year they also played the Night of the Prog Festival in Loreley, Germany, as well as concerts at the Kentish Town Forum, in London on 1 November, at the Picture House, Edinburgh on 2 November, and their first live concert in the US for over a decade, at the UCLA Royce Hall, Los Angeles on 7 November.

In 2009, the group announced that they would play a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London, on 1 April 2010, titled the Zeitgeist concert, 35 years after their milestone concert there on 2 April 1975. The entire concert was released as a 3-CD live album on 7 July 2010.

Tangerine Dream embarked in spring and summer 2012 on a tour of Europe, Canada and the USA called &quot;The Electric Mandarine Tour 2012&quot;: The 1st leg was a 5-date European tour, beginning on 10 April in Budapest (Hungary) via Padua (Italy), Milano (Italy), Zurich (Switzerland), and ending on 10 May in Berlin (Germany). The 2nd leg was a North-American tour that started with the Jazz Festival in Montréal (Canada) on 30 June, followed by a concert on 4 July at the Bluesfest in Ottawa (Canada) and continued as a 10-date US journey beginning in July in Boston, then New York, Philadelphia, Washington, and California. On 16 November 2014, Tangerine Dream performed in Melbourne, Australia, as part of Melbourne Music Week. They were the final shows with Froese. Tangerine Dream played two consecutive nights at the Union Chapel, Islington London on April 23 &amp; 24 2018, the second supported by ex-Japan and Porcupine Tree musician Richard Barbieri. In October and November 2019, Tangerine Dream went on its 16 step &quot;Random &amp; Revision&quot; Tour.

2023 saw the band embark on the largest tour of their entire career, including a 19-date tour of North America (September 8 – October 5: taking in Miami, Asheville, Atlanta, Dallas, Austin, Albuquerque, Tucson, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Vancouver, Seattle, Philadelphia, Washington, New York, Montreal, Toronto and Chicago), 13-dates in Germany (October 10 – 28), and 10-dates in the UK (November 5 – 14)

===After Edgar Froese&#x27;s death===
Edgar Froese died suddenly in Vienna on 20 January 2015 from a pulmonary embolism. On 6 April 2015, the group&#x27;s remaining members (Quaeschning, Schnauss and Yamane) and Bianca Acquaye (Froese&#x27;s widow), pledged to continue working together in an effort to fulfill Froese&#x27;s vision for the group. However, ex-member Jerome Froese announced on his Facebook timeline that, in his opinion, Tangerine Dream will not exist without his father.

Tangerine Dream played their first show following Froese&#x27;s death on 9 June 2016 in Szczecin, Poland.

On 29 September 2017, Tangerine Dream released their new studio album entitled, &quot;Quantum Gate&quot;, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the band&#x27;s foundation. The album is based on ideas and musical sketches by founder Edgar Froese and was completed by the remaining members of the band.

On 31 January 2020, Tangerine Dream re-released their December 2019 album &quot;Recurring Dreams&quot;, an eleven-track collection of new recordings of some of the band&#x27;s classic tracks, worldwide through Kscope. This was launched to coincide with the &quot;Tangerine Dream: Zeitraffer&quot; exhibition, which opened on 17 January 2020 at London&#x27;s Barbican and runs until 2 May 2020.

On 9 June 2020, Paul Frick became the first member to join the group following Edgar&#x27;s death after having made guest appearances with the band, starting in November 2018. Later on, the group started working on a new studio album entitled, &quot;Raum&quot;, featuring Froese&#x27;s archival recordings in early 2022 via Kscope. Frick has the unique distinction of being the first addition to the group who did not ever personally meet Froese.

It was announced on 22 June 2021 that Ulrich Schnauss has decided to stop performing live. Since then, the band&#x27;s official website lists him as a former member.

In March 2023, the band embarked on the longest tour of their entire career, with concerts in Portugal (Casa da Música), Switzerland (Geneva&#x27;s Electron Festival), the Netherlands (3-date tour), Belgium (Het Depot), France (La Gaîté Lyrique), Poland (2-date tour), Romania (Transilvania International Film Festival), the United States (16-date tour), Canada (3-date tour), Germany (12-date tour), the United Kingdom (10-date tour), and Poland (1-date).

==Artistic connections==
===Influences===
Tangerine Dream began as a surreal krautrock band, with each of the members contributing different musical influences and styles, before becoming a &quot;revered progressive electronic act.&quot; Edgar Froese&#x27;s guitar style was inspired by Jimi Hendrix, as well as the avant-garde composers Iannis Xenakis and Karlheinz Stockhausen, while Christopher Franke contributed elements of György Ligeti and Terry Riley. Yes-like progressive rock influence was brought in by Steve Jolliffe on &quot;Cyclone&quot;. The sample-based sound collages of Johannes Schmoelling drew their inspiration from a number of sources; one instance is Steve Reich&#x27;s Music for 18 Musicians on parts of &quot;Logos Live&quot;, and the track &quot;Love on a Real Train&quot; from the &quot;Risky Business&quot; soundtrack.

Classical music has had an influence on the sound of Tangerine Dream over the years. György Ligeti, Johann Sebastian Bach, Pierre Boulez, Iannis Xenakis, Maurice Ravel, and Arcangelo Corelli are clearly visible as dominant influences in the early albums. A Baroque sensibility sometimes informs the more coordinated sequencer patterns, which has its most direct expression in the La Folia section that comes at the very end of the title track of Force Majeure. In live performances, the piano solos often directly quoted from Romantic classical works for piano, such as the Beethoven and Mozart snippets in much of the late 1970s – early 1980s stage shows. In the bootleg recording of the Mannheim Mozartsaal concert of 1976 (Tangerine Tree volume 13), the first part of the first piece also clearly quotes from Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Totentanz&quot;. The first phrase is played on a harpsichord synthesizer patch and is answered by the second half of the phrase in a flute voicing on a Mellotron. During the 1990s, many releases included recordings of classical compositions: Pictures at an Exhibition (on &quot;Turn of the Tides&quot;), Largo (from Xerxes) (on &quot;Tyranny of Beauty&quot;), Symphony in A Minor (by J. S. Bach), and Concerto in A Major / Adagio (by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) (both on &quot;Ambient Monkeys&quot;).

Since the 1990s, Tangerine Dream have also recorded cover versions of Jimi Hendrix&#x27; &quot;Purple Haze&quot; (first on &quot;220 Volt Live&quot;) and The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, and &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;.

An infrequently recurring non-musical influence on Tangerine Dream, and Edgar Froese in particular, have been 12th–19th-century poets. This was first evident on the 1981 album &quot;Exit&quot;, the track title &quot;Pilots of the Purple Twilight&quot; being a quote from Alfred Lord Tennyson&#x27;s poem &quot;Locksley Hall&quot;. Six years later, the album &quot;Tyger&quot; featured poems from William Blake set to music; and around the turn of the millennium, Edgar Froese started working on a musical trilogy based on Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, completed in 2006. Most recently, the 2007 album &quot;Madcap&#x27;s Flaming Duty&quot; features more poems set to music, some again from Blake but also e.g. Walt Whitman.

Pink Floyd were also an influence on Edgar Froese and Tangerine Dream, the band in its very early psychedelic rock band phase playing improvisations based on Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;. &quot;Madcap&#x27;s Flaming Duty&quot; is dedicated to the memory of the late Syd Barrett. The title refers to Barrett&#x27;s solo release &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot;.

The band&#x27;s influence can be felt in ambient artists such as Deepspace, The Future Sound of London, David Kristian, and Global Communication, as well as rock, pop, and dance artists such as Porcupine Tree, M83, DJ Shadow, Ulrich Schnauss, Cut Copy, and Kasabian. The band also clearly influenced 1990s and 2000s trance music, notably Chicane; both &quot;Offshore&quot; and &quot;Sunstroke&quot; borrow heavily from &quot;Love on a Real Train&quot; where lush soundscapes and synth pads are used along with repetitive synth sequences, much like in their 1975 releases &quot;Rubycon&quot; and &quot;Ricochet&quot;, as well as some of their music from the early 1980s. The group have also been sampled countless times, more recently by Recoil on the album &quot;SubHuman&quot;, by Sasha on &quot;Involver&quot;, and on several Houzan Suzuki albums. Michael Jackson also expressed being a fan of Tangerine Dream, specifically their 1977 soundtrack for the film &quot;Sorcerer&quot;. It inspired him to get a Synclavier II, which a demo of would be used as the intro for Beat It. 

===In popular culture===
* In the critically acclaimed 1991 Mexican telenovela Cadenas de Amargura, Tangerine Dream&#x27;s song &quot;Yucatan&quot; is used as part of the novela&#x27;s music score particularly in the more suspenseful scenes.
* Steven Wilson, of Porcupine Tree, stated that Tangerine Dream was one of his influences to make his music, and often cites &quot;Zeit&quot; as his all-time favorite album.
* Japanese electronic musician Susumu Hirasawa dedicated his song to Tangerine Dream.
* In 2016, Netflix&#x27;s original show &quot;Stranger Things&quot; used three Tangerine Dream tracks in its soundtrack: &quot;Green Desert&quot; from Green Desert (1986) in episode five, &quot;Exit&quot; from Exit (1981) in episode six, of season 1 and &quot;Tangent (Rare Bird)&quot; from Poland (1984) in episode nine of season 2. Composers of the soundtrack for the show, Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein of the electronic band Survive, also cited Tangerine Dream as the key influence behind the soundtrack, the main theme of which was later covered by Tangerine Dream.
* In 2022, the horned dinosaur &quot;Bisticeratops froeseorum&quot; was named in memory of Edgar Froese, the late founder of Tangerine Dream.

==Personnel==

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Tangerine Dream existed as several short-lived incarnations, all of which included Froese, who teamed up with several musicians from West Berlin&#x27;s underground music scene, including Steve Jolliffe, Sven-Åke Johansson, Klaus Schulze, and Conrad Schnitzler.

Froese&#x27;s most notable association was his partnership with Christopher Franke. Franke joined Tangerine Dream in 1970 after serving time in the group Agitation Free, originally to replace Schulze as the drummer. Franke is credited with starting to use electronic sequencers, which were introduced on &quot;Phaedra&quot;, a development that had not only a large impact on the group&#x27;s music but on many electronic musicians to this day. Franke stayed with the group for 17 years, leaving in 1988 because of exhausting touring schedules, as well as creative differences with Froese.

Other long-term members of the group include Peter Baumann (1971–1977), who later went on to found the new-age label Private Music, to which the band was signed from 1988 to 1991; Johannes Schmoelling (1979–1985); Paul Haslinger (1986–1990); Froese&#x27;s son Jerome Froese (1990–2006); Linda Spa (1990–1996, 2005–2014), a saxophonist &amp; flute player who appeared on numerous albums and concerts, contributing one track on &quot;Goblins&#x27; Club&quot;; and most recently Thorsten Quaeschning of Picture Palace Music (2005–present).

A number of other members were also part of Tangerine Dream for shorter periods of time. Unlike session musicians, these players also contributed to compositions of the band during their tenures. Some of the more notable members are Steve Schroyder (organist, 1971–1972), Michael Hoenig (who replaced Baumann for a 1975 Australian tour and a London concert, included on &quot;Bootleg Box Set Vol. 1&quot;), Steve Jolliffe (wind instruments, keyboards and vocals on &quot;Cyclone&quot; and the following tour; he was also part of a short-lived 1969 line-up), Klaus Krüger (drummer on &quot;Cyclone&quot; and &quot;Force Majeure&quot;) and Ralf Wadephul (in collaboration with Edgar Froese recorded album &quot;Blue Dawn&quot;, but it was released only in 2006; also credited for one track on &quot;Optical Race&quot; (1988) and toured with the band in support of this album).

Throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s, Tangerine Dream was often joined on stage by Zlatko Perica or Gerald Gradwohl on guitars, and Emil Hachfeld on electronic drums. Jerome Froese left in 2006 after a concert at the Tempodrom in Berlin. Until late 2014, Tangerine Dream comprised Edgar Froese, as well as Thorsten Quaeschning, who first collaborated in the composition of &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; (2005). For concerts and recordings, they were usually joined by Linda Spa on saxophone and flute, Iris Camaa on drums and percussion, and Bernhard Beibl on guitar. In 2011, electric violinist Hoshiko Yamane was added to the lineup and is featured on some of the most recent albums.

In late 2014, Bernhard Beibl announced on his Facebook page that he would stop collaborating with Tangerine Dream. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that Tangerine Dream would no longer be touring with Linda Spa or Iris Camaa, but that Ulrich Schnauss had been brought into the fold. Edgar Froese&#x27;s death in January 2015, however, left this a short-lived line-up.

<doc id="42563" wikidata="Q689884" url="?curid=42563" title="Polyp (zoology)">
<text>A polyp in zoology is one of two forms found in the phylum Cnidaria, the other being the medusa. Polyps are roughly cylindrical in shape and elongated at the axis of the vase-shaped body. In solitary polyps, the aboral (opposite to oral) end is attached to the substrate by means of a disc-like holdfast called a pedal disc, while in colonies of polyps it is connected to other polyps, either directly or indirectly. The oral end contains the mouth, and is surrounded by a circlet of tentacles.

==Classes==
In the class Anthozoa, comprising the sea anemones and corals, the individual is always a polyp; in the class Hydrozoa, however, the individual may be either a polyp or a medusa, with most species undergoing a life cycle with both a polyp stage and a medusa stage. 

In the class Scyphozoa, the medusa stage is dominant, and the polyp stage may or may not be present, depending on the family. In those scyphozoans that have the larval planula metamorphose into a polyp, the polyp, also called a &quot;scyphistoma,&quot; grows until it develops a stack of plate-like medusae that pinch off and swim away in a process known as strobilation. Once strobilation is complete, the polyp may die, or regenerate itself to repeat the process again later. With cubozoans, the planula settles onto a suitable surface, and develops into a polyp. The cubozoan polyp then eventually metamorphoses directly into a medusa.

==Anatomy==

The body of the polyp may be roughly compared in a structure to a sac, the wall of which is composed of two layers of cells. The outer layer is known technically as the &quot;ectoderm&quot;, with the inner layer as the &quot;endoderm&quot; (or &quot;gastroderm&quot;). Between ectoderm and endoderm is a supporting layer of structureless gelatinous substance termed mesoglea, secreted by the cell layers of the body wall. The mesoglea can be thinner than the endoderm or ectoderm or comprise the bulk of the body as in larger jellyfish. The mesoglea can contain skeletal elements derived from cells migrated from ectoderm.

The sac-like body built up in this way is attached usually to some firm object by its blind end, and bears at the upper end the mouth which is surrounded by a circle of tentacles which resemble glove fingers. The tentacles are organs which serve both for the tactile sense and for the capture of food. Polyps extend their tentacles, particularly at night, containing coiled stinging nettle-like cells, or nematocysts, which pierce, poison, and firmly hold living prey paralysing or killing them. Polyp prey includes copepods and fish larvae. Longitudinal muscular fibrils formed from the cells of the ectoderm allow tentacles to contract when conveying the food to the mouth. Similarly, circularly disposed muscular fibrils formed from the endoderm permit tentacles to be protract or thrust out once they are contracted. These muscle fibres belong to the same two systems, allowing the whole body to retract or protrude outwards.

We can distinguish therefore in the body of a polyp the column, circular or oval in section, forming the trunk, resting on a base or foot and surmounted by the crown of tentacles, which enclose an area termed the peristome, in the centre of which again is the mouth. Generally, there is no other opening to the body except the mouth, but in some cases excretory pores are known to occur in the foot, and pores may occur at the tips of the tentacles. A polyp is an animal of very simple structure, a living fossil that has not changed significantly for about half a billion years (per generally accepted dating of Cambrian sedimentary rock).

The external form of the polyp varies greatly in different cases. The column may be long and slender, or may be so short in the vertical direction that the body becomes disk-like. The tentacles may number many hundreds or may be very few, in rare cases only one or two. They may be long and filamentous, or short and reduced to mere knobs or warts. They may be simple and unbranched, or they may be feathery in pattern. The mouth may be level with the surface of the peristome, or may be projecting and trumpet-shaped. As regards internal structure, polyps exhibit two well-marked types of organization, each characteristic of one of the two classes, Hydrozoa and Anthozoa.

In the class Hydrozoa, the polyps are indeed often very simple, like the common little fresh water species of the genus &quot;Hydra&quot;. Anthozoan polyps, including the corals and sea anemones, are much more complex due to the development of a tubular stomodaeum leading inward from the mouth and a series of radial partitions called mesenteries. Many of the mesenteries project into the enteric cavity but some extend from the body wall to the central stomodaeum.

==Reproduction==
It is an almost universal attribute of polyps to reproduce asexually by the method of budding. This mode of reproduction may be combined with sexual reproduction, or may be the sole method by which the polyp produces offspring, in which case the polyp is entirely without sexual organs. 

===Asexual reproduction===
In many cases the buds formed do not separate from the parent but remain in continuity with it, thus forming colonies or stocks, which may reach a great size and contain a vast number of individuals. Slight differences in the method of budding produce great variations in the form of the colonies. The reef-building corals are polyp-colonies, strengthened by the formation of a firm skeleton.

===Sexual reproduction===
Among sea anemones, sexual plasticity may occur. That is, asexually produced clones derived from a single founder individual can contain both male and female individuals (ramets). When eggs and sperm (gametes) are formed, they can produce zygotes derived from &quot;selfing&quot; (within the founding clone) or out-crossing, that then develop into swimming planula larvae.

The overwhelming majority of stony coral (&quot;Scleractinia&quot;) taxa are hermaphroditic in their adult colonies. In these species, there is ordinarily synchronized release of eggs and sperm into the water during brief spawning events. Although some species are capable of self-fertilization to varying extents, cross-fertilization appears to be the dominant mating pattern.

==Etymology==
The name polyp was given by René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur to these organisms from their superficial resemblance to an octopus (, ultimately from Ancient Greek adverb (, &quot;much&quot;) + noun (, &quot;foot&quot;)), with its circle of writhing arms round the mouth. This comparison contrasts to the common name &quot;coral-insects&quot;, applied to the polyps which form coral.

== Threats ==
75% of the world&#x27;s corals are threatened due to overfishing, destructive fishing, coastal development, pollution, thermal stress, ocean acidification, crown-of-thorns starfish, and introduced invasive species.

In recent decades the conditions that corals and polyps have found themselves in have been changing, leading to new diseases being observed in corals in many parts of the world, posing even greater risk to an already pressured animal. Aquatic life has been put under a substantial amount of stress because of the pollutants caused by land-based agriculture. Particularly, exposure to the insecticide profenofos and the fungicide MEMC have played a major part in polyp retraction and biomass decrease.

There have been many experiments supporting the hypothesis that heat stress in &quot;Acropora tenuis&quot; juvenile polyps provokes an up-regulation of protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. The results vary based on the polyp characteristics such as age, type, and growth stage.

<doc id="42564" wikidata="Q868460" url="?curid=42564" title="Ovipositor">
<text>The ovipositor is a tube-like organ used by some animals, especially insects, for the laying of eggs. In insects, an ovipositor consists of a maximum of three pairs of appendages. The details and morphology of the ovipositor vary, but typically its form is adapted to functions such as preparing a place for the egg, transmitting the egg, and then placing it properly. For most insects, the organ is used merely to attach the egg to some surface, but for many parasitic species (primarily in wasps and other Hymenoptera), it is a piercing organ as well.

Some ovipositors only retract partly when not in use, and the basal part that sticks out is known as the scape, or more specifically oviscape, the word &quot;scape&quot; deriving from the Latin word , meaning &quot;stalk&quot; or &quot;shaft&quot;.

== In insects ==
Grasshoppers use their ovipositors to force a burrow into the earth to receive the eggs. Cicadas pierce the wood of twigs with their ovipositors to insert the eggs. Sawflies slit the tissues of plants by means of the ovipositor and so do some species of long-horned grasshoppers. In the ichneumon wasp genus &quot;Megarhyssa&quot;, the females have a slender ovipositor (terebra) several inches long that is used to drill into the wood of tree trunks. These wasps are parasitic in the larval stage on the larvae of horntail wasps, hence the egg must be deposited directly into the host&#x27;s body as it is feeding. The ovipositors of &quot;Megarhyssa&quot; are among the longest egg-laying organs (relative to body size) known.

The stingers of the Aculeata (wasps, hornets, bees, and ants) are ovipositors, highly modified and with associated venom glands. They are used to paralyze prey, or as defensive weapons. The penetrating sting plus venom allows the wasp to lay eggs with less risk of injury from the host. In some cases, the injection also introduces virus particles that suppress the host&#x27;s immune system and prevent it from destroying the eggs. However, in virtually all stinging Hymenoptera, the ovipositor is no longer used for egg-laying. An exception is the family Chrysididae, members of the Hymenoptera, in which species such as &quot;Chrysis ignita&quot; have reduced stinging apparatus and a functional ovipositor. 

Fig wasp ovipositors have specialized serrated teeth to penetrate fruits, but gall wasps have either uniform teeth or no teeth on their ovipositors, meaning the morphology of the organ is related to the life history. 

Members of the Dipteran (fly) families Tephritidae and Pyrgotidae have well-developed ovipositors that are partly retracted when not in use, with the part that sticks out being the oviscape. Oestridae, another family within Diptera, often have short hairy ovipositors, the species &quot;Cuterebra fontinella&quot; has one of the shortest within the family.

Ovipositors exist not only in winged insects, but also in Apterygota, where the ovipositor has an additional function in gathering the spermatophore during mating. Little is known about the egg-laying habits of these insects in the wild. 

== In fish ==
Female bitterlings in the genus &quot;Rhodeus&quot; have an ovipositor in the form of a tubular extension of the genital orifice. During breeding season, they use it when depositing eggs in the mantle cavity of freshwater mussels, where their eggs develop in reasonable security. Seahorses have an ovipositor for introducing eggs into the brood pouch of the male, who carries them until it is time to release the fry into a suitable situation in the open water.

== In amphibians ==
The marbled newt, or &quot;Triturus marmoratus,&quot; females participate in parental investment by ovipositing their eggs. They carefully wrap them in aquatic leaves as a form of protection, scattering them throughout a pond to avoid predation. Females are not able to breathe during the oviposition process; therefore, the benefit to wrapping the eggs outweigh the cost of holding their breath.

<text>In chemistry, an ionic crystal is a crystalline form of an ionic compound. They are solids consisting of ions bound together by their electrostatic attraction into a regular lattice. Examples of such crystals are the alkali halides, including potassium fluoride (KF), potassium chloride (KCl), potassium bromide (KBr), potassium iodide (KI), sodium fluoride (NaF).
Sodium chloride (NaCl) has a 6:6 co-ordination. The properties of NaCl reflect the strong interactions that exist between the ions. It is a good conductor of electricity when molten, but very poor in the solid state. When fused the mobile ions carry charge through the liquid.
They are characterized by strong absorption of infrared radiation and have planes along which they cleave easily.
The exact arrangement of ions in an ionic lattice varies according to the size of the ions in the solid.

<doc id="42567" wikidata="Q9371" url="?curid=42567" title="Spleen">
<text>The spleen (, from Ancient Greek &quot; σπλήν&quot;, splḗn) is an organ found in almost all vertebrates. Similar in structure to a large lymph node, it acts primarily as a blood filter.

The spleen plays important roles in regard to red blood cells (erythrocytes) and the immune system. It removes old red blood cells and holds a reserve of blood, which can be valuable in case of hemorrhagic shock, and also recycles iron. As a part of the mononuclear phagocyte system, it metabolizes hemoglobin removed from senescent red blood cells. The globin portion of hemoglobin is degraded to its constitutive amino acids, and the heme portion is metabolized to bilirubin, which is removed in the liver.

The spleen houses antibody-producing lymphocytes in its white pulp and monocytes which remove antibody-coated bacteria and antibody-coated blood cells by way of blood and lymph node circulation. These monocytes, upon moving to injured tissue (such as the heart after myocardial infarction), turn into dendritic cells and macrophages while promoting tissue healing. The spleen is a center of activity of the mononuclear phagocyte system and is analogous to a large lymph node, as its absence causes a predisposition to certain infections.

In humans, the spleen is purple in color and is in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. The surgical process to remove the spleen is known as a splenectomy.

== Structure ==
In humans, the spleen is underneath the left part of the diaphragm, and has a smooth, convex surface that faces the diaphragm. It is underneath the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs. The other side of the spleen is divided by a ridge into two regions: an anterior gastric portion, and a posterior renal portion. The gastric surface is directed forward, upward, and toward the middle, is broad and concave, and is in contact with the posterior wall of the stomach. Below this it is in contact with the tail of the pancreas. The renal surface is directed medialward and downward. It is somewhat flattened, considerably narrower than the gastric surface, and is in relation with the upper part of the anterior surface of the left kidney and occasionally with the left adrenal gland.

There are four ligaments attached to the spleen: gastrosplenic ligament, splenorenal ligament, colicosplenic ligament, and phrenocolic ligament.

=== Measurements ===
The spleen, in healthy adult humans, is approximately in length.

An easy way to remember the anatomy of the spleen is the 1×3×5×7×9×10×11 rule. The spleen is , weighs approximately , and lies between the ninth and eleventh ribs on the left-hand side and along the axis of the tenth rib. The weight varies between and (standard reference range), correlating mainly to height, body weight and degree of acute congestion but not to sex or age.

=== Blood supply ===

Near the middle of the spleen is a long fissure, the hilum, which is the point of attachment for the gastrosplenic ligament and the point of insertion for the splenic artery and splenic vein. There are other openings present for lymphatic vessels and nerves. In addition to the splenic artery, collateral blood supply is provided by the adjacent short gastric arteries.

Like the thymus, the spleen possesses only efferent lymphatic vessels. The spleen is part of the lymphatic system. Both the short gastric arteries and the splenic artery supply it with blood.

The germinal centers are supplied by arterioles called &quot;penicilliary radicles&quot;.

=== Nerve supply ===
The spleen is innervated by the splenic plexus, which connects a branch of the celiac ganglia to the vagus nerve.

The underlying central nervous processes coordinating the spleen&#x27;s function seem to be embedded into the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis, and the brainstem, especially the subfornical organ.

=== Development ===
The spleen is unique in respect to its development within the gut. While most of the gut organs are endodermally derived, the spleen is derived from mesenchymal tissue. Specifically, the spleen forms within, and from, the dorsal mesentery. However, it still shares the same blood supply—the celiac trunk—as the foregut organs.

== Function ==

=== Pulp ===


=== Other ===
Other functions of the spleen are less prominent, especially in the healthy adult:
*Spleen produces all types of blood cells during fetal life
* Production of opsonins, properdin, and tuftsin.
* Release of neutrophils following myocardial infarction.
* Creation of red blood cells. While the bone marrow is the primary site of hematopoiesis in the adult, the spleen has important hematopoietic functions up until the fifth month of gestation. After birth, erythropoietic functions cease, except in some hematologic disorders. As a major lymphoid organ and a central player in the reticuloendothelial system, the spleen retains the ability to produce lymphocytes and, as such, remains a hematopoietic organ.
* Storage of red blood cells, lymphocytes and other formed elements. The spleen of horses stores roughly 30 percent of the red blood cells and can release them when needed. In humans, up to a cup (240 ml) of red blood cells is held within the spleen and released in cases of hypovolemia and hypoxia. It can store platelets in case of an emergency and also clears old platelets from the circulation. Up to a quarter of lymphocytes are stored in the spleen at any one time.

== Clinical significance ==
=== Enlarged spleen ===
Enlargement of the spleen is known as splenomegaly. It may be caused by sickle cell anemia, sarcoidosis, malaria, bacterial endocarditis, leukemia, polycythemia vera, pernicious anemia, Gaucher&#x27;s disease, leishmaniasis, Hodgkin&#x27;s disease, Banti&#x27;s disease, hereditary spherocytosis, cysts, glandular fever (including mononucleosis or &#x27;Mono&#x27; caused by the Epstein–Barr virus and infection from cytomegalovirus), and tumours. Primary tumors of the spleen include hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas. Marked splenomegaly may result in the spleen occupying a large portion of the left side of the abdomen.

The spleen is the largest collection of lymphoid tissue in the body. It is normally palpable in preterm infants, in 30% of normal, full-term neonates, and in 5% to 10% of infants and toddlers. A spleen easily palpable below the costal margin in any child over the age of three to four years should be considered abnormal until proven otherwise.

Splenomegaly can result from antigenic stimulation (e.g., infection), obstruction of blood flow (e.g., portal vein obstruction), underlying functional abnormality (e.g., hemolytic anemia), or infiltration (e.g., leukemia or storage disease, such as Gaucher&#x27;s disease). The most common cause of acute splenomegaly in children is viral infection, which is transient and usually moderate. Basic work-up for acute splenomegaly includes a complete blood count with differential, platelet count, and reticulocyte and atypical lymphocyte counts to exclude hemolytic anemia and leukemia. Assessment of IgM antibodies to viral capsid antigen (a rising titer) is indicated to confirm Epstein–Barr virus or cytomegalovirus. Other infections should be excluded if these tests are negative.

Calculators have been developed for measurements of spleen size based on CT, US, and MRI findings.

=== Splenic injury ===

Trauma, such as a road traffic collision, can cause rupture of the spleen, which is a situation requiring immediate medical attention.

=== Asplenia ===
Asplenia refers to a non-functioning spleen, which may be congenital, or caused by traumatic injury, surgical resection (splenectomy) or a disease such as sickle cell anaemia. Hyposplenia refers to a partially functioning spleen. These conditions may cause a modest increase in circulating white blood cells and platelets, a diminished response to some vaccines, and an increased susceptibility to infection. In particular, there is an increased risk of sepsis from polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria. Encapsulated bacteria inhibit binding of complement or prevent complement assembled on the capsule from interacting with macrophage receptors. Phagocytosis needs natural antibodies, which are immunoglobulins that facilitate phagocytosis either directly or by complement deposition on the capsule. They are produced by IgM memory B cells (a subtype of B cells) in the marginal zone of the spleen.

A splenectomy (removal of the spleen) results in a greatly diminished frequency of memory B cells. A 28-year follow-up of 740 World War II veterans whose spleens were removed on the battlefield showed a significant increase in the usual death rate from pneumonia (6 rather than the expected 1.3) and an increase in the death rate from ischemic heart disease (41 rather than the expected 30), but not from other conditions.

=== Accessory spleen ===
An accessory spleen is a small splenic nodule extra to the spleen usually formed in early embryogenesis. Accessory spleens are found in approximately 10 percent of the population and are typically around 1 centimeter in diameter. &quot;Splenosis&quot; is a condition where displaced pieces of splenic tissue (often following trauma or splenectomy) autotransplant in the abdominal cavity as accessory spleens.

Polysplenia is a congenital disease manifested by multiple small accessory spleens, rather than a single, full-sized, normal spleen. Polysplenia sometimes occurs alone, but it is often accompanied by other developmental abnormalities such as intestinal malrotation or biliary atresia, or cardiac abnormalities, such as dextrocardia. These accessory spleens are non-functional.

=== Infarction ===
Splenic infarction is a condition in which blood flow supply to the spleen is compromised, leading to partial or complete infarction (tissue death due to oxygen shortage) in the organ.

Splenic infarction occurs when the splenic artery or one of its branches are occluded, for example by a blood clot. Although it can occur asymptomatically, the typical symptom is severe pain in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, sometimes radiating to the left shoulder. Fever and chills develop in some cases. It has to be differentiated from other causes of acute abdomen.

=== Hyaloserositis ===
The spleen may be affected by hyaloserositis, in which it is coated with fibrous hyaline.

== Society and culture ==
There has been a long and varied history of misconceptions regarding the physiological role of the spleen, and it has often been seen as a reservoir for juices closely linked to digestion. In various cultures, the organ has been linked to melancholia, due to the influence of ancient Greek medicine and the associated doctrine of humourism, in which the spleen was believed to be a reservoir for an elusive fluid known as &quot;black bile&quot; (one of the four humours). The spleen also plays an important role in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is considered to be a key organ that displays the Yin aspect of the Earth element (its Yang counterpart is the stomach). In contrast, the Talmud (tractate Berachoth 61b) refers to the spleen as the organ of laughter while possibly suggesting a link with the humoral view of the organ.

Etymologically, &quot;spleen&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek (&quot;splḗn&quot;), where it was the idiomatic equivalent of the heart in modern English. Persius, in his satires, associated &quot;spleen&quot; with immoderate laughter. The native Old English word for it is , now primarily used for animals; a loanword from Latin is .

In English, William Shakespeare frequently used the word &quot;spleen&quot; to signify melancholy, but also and merriment. In &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, he uses the spleen to describe Cassius&#x27;s irritable nature:

&lt;poem&gt;Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch
Under your testy humour? By the gods
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
I&#x27;ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
When you are waspish.&lt;/poem&gt;

The spleen, as a byword for melancholy, has also been considered an actual disease. In the early 18th century, the physician Richard Blackmore considered it to be one of the two most prevalent diseases in England (along with consumption). In 1701, Anne Finch (later, Countess of Winchilsea) had published a Pindaric ode, &quot;The Spleen&quot;, drawing on her first-hand experiences of an affliction which, at the time, also had a reputation of being a fashionably upper-class disease of the English. Both Blackmore and George Cheyne treated this malady as the male equivalent of &quot;the vapours&quot;, while preferring the more learned terms &quot;hypochondriasis&quot; and &quot;hysteria&quot;. In the late 18th century, the German word &quot;Spleen&quot; came to denote eccentric and hypochondriac tendencies that were thought to be characteristic of English people.

In French, &quot;splénétique&quot; refers to a state of pensive sadness or melancholy. This usage was popularised by the poems of Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867) and his collection &quot;Le Spleen de Paris&quot;, but it was also present in earlier 19th-century Romantic literature.

=== Food ===
The spleen is one of the many organs that may be included in offal. It is not widely eaten as a principal ingredient, but cow spleen sandwiches are eaten in Sicilian cuisine. Chicken spleen is one of the main ingredients of Jerusalem mixed grill.

== Other animals ==
In cartilaginous and ray-finned fish, the spleen consists primarily of red pulp and is normally somewhat elongated, as it lies inside the serosal lining of the intestine. In many amphibians, especially frogs, it has the more rounded form and there is often a greater quantity of white pulp.

In reptiles, birds, and mammals, white pulp is always relatively plentiful, and in birds and some mammals the spleen is typically rounded, but it adjusts its shape somewhat to the arrangement of the surrounding organs. In most vertebrates, the spleen continues to produce red blood cells throughout life; only in mammals this function is lost in middle-aged adults. Many mammals have tiny spleen-like structures known as haemal nodes throughout the body that are presumed to have the same function as the spleen. The spleens of aquatic mammals differ in some ways from those of fully land-dwelling mammals; in general they are bluish in colour. In cetaceans and manatees, they tend to be quite small, but in deep diving pinnipeds, they can be massive, due to their function of storing red blood cells.

Marsupials have y-shaped spleens, and it develops postnatally.

The only vertebrates lacking a spleen are the lampreys and hagfishes (the early-branching Cyclostomata, or jawless fishes). Even in these animals, there is a diffuse layer of haematopoeitic tissue within the gut wall, which has a similar structure to red pulp and is presumed homologous with the spleen of higher vertebrates.

In mice, the spleen stores half the body&#x27;s monocytes so that, upon injury, they can migrate to the injured tissue and transform into dendritic cells and macrophages to assist wound healing.

<doc id="42571" wikidata="Q4470" url="?curid=42571" title="The Wheel of Time">
<text>The Wheel of Time is a series of high fantasy novels by American author Robert Jordan, with Brandon Sanderson as a co-author for the final three installments. Originally planned as a six-book series with the publication of &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; in 1990, &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; came to span 14 volumes, in addition to a prequel novel and three companion books. Jordan died in 2007 while working on what was planned to be the twelfth and final volume in the series. He prepared extensive notes, which enabled fellow fantasy author Sanderson to complete the final book, which grew into three volumes: &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot; (2009), &quot;Towers of Midnight&quot; (2010), and &quot;A Memory of Light&quot; (2013).

The series draws on numerous elements of both European and Asian mythology, most notably the cyclical nature of time found in Buddhism and Hinduism; the metaphysical concepts of balance, duality, and a respect for nature found in Taoism; and the dualistic concepts of God and Satan.

&quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; is notable for its length, detailed imaginary world, magic system, and its large cast of characters. The eighth through fourteenth books each reached number one on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. After its completion, the series was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Novel. , the series has sold over 90 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling epic fantasy series since &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Its popularity has spawned comic book adaptations, a collectible card game, a video game, a roleplaying game, and a soundtrack album. A television series adaptation produced by Sony Pictures and Amazon Studios premiered in 2021.

== Setting ==
=== The One Power and the Aes Sedai ===
The series is set in the Third Age of a fantasy world in which the pattern of human existence is determined and maintained by the Wheel of Time, a cosmic embodiment of eternal return. The Wheel spins the Pattern of the Ages, manifest in both the physical world and human destiny, using the lives of men and women as its threads. Individuals with the power to influence and change the Pattern are called &quot;ta&#x27;veren&quot;. The Wheel is rotated by a magical force called the One Power. The ability to access and wield the One Power is known as channeling, and only women can do this safely. Artifacts called &quot;angreal&quot; amplify the One Power, with &quot;sa&#x27;angreal&quot; being the most potent, and &quot;ter&#x27;angreal&quot; limited to specific functions.

A matriarchal order called the Aes Sedai, made up of female channelers, are both respected and feared across the world. Their stated goal is to use their skills to serve and protect humanity, but they are also preparing for the inevitable, prophesized return of a malevolent entity they call the Dark One. The leader of the Aes Sedai, known as the Amyrlin Seat, rules from the White Tower in the city of Tar Valon. The order is divided into seven disciplines, or Ajahs: the Blue Ajah are dedicated to the pursuit of justice and inevitably intrigue, possessing extensive spy networks; the Brown Ajah are dedicated to the preservation of knowledge and history; the Gray Ajah are dedicated to mediation and politics; the Green Ajah are warriors trained in battle and strategy; the Red Ajah monitor the use of the One Power by outsiders; the White Ajah are concerned with logic and truth; the Yellow Ajah are mistresses of healing; and a secret eighth faction, the Black Ajah, pose as members of other Ajahs but serve the Dark One. The few men born with the ability to channel ultimately go mad, so the Red Ajah hunt male channelers and &quot;gentle&quot; them, or cut them off permanently from the One Power, ever aware of the danger they represent. With the exception of the Red Ajah, the Aes Sedai each bond magically with a Warder, a male protector. The link bestows the Warder with heightened senses, strength, stamina and resistance to injury.

=== Geography and cultures ===
The primary continent depicted in the series consists of three regions: the Westlands, Shara far to the east, and the Aiel Waste in between. The Aiel Waste is separated from the westlands by the spine of the world. Connecting these three areas in the north is the eastern part of the Great Blight, a once-verdant land mass that has been corrupted by the Dark One&#x27;s influence. It stretches far west across the Aryth Ocean and borders the north of the continent of Seanchan. South of the Westlands is the Sea of Storms, and the small continent known as the Land of the Madmen. The Westlands contain 14 nations, including Andor, Cairhien, Illian, Shienar and Tear, as well as four major city-states: Falme, Far Madding, Mayene and Tar Valon. Other notable cities include Caemlyn, the capital of Andor, and Fal Dara, the northernmost city in Shienar. Two Rivers is a region in Andor which includes the village Emond&#x27;s Field, home of five of the series&#x27; main characters. Shara, which extends much further south than either the Westlands or the Aiel Waste, is separated from the rest of the continent by the Cliffs of the Dawn and the Great Rift. Shara remains mysterious to outsiders, who are only allowed to enter walled-off towns to trade. The world in which the series is set is sometimes called &quot;Randland&quot; by fans, referring to lead character Rand al&#x27;Thor.

The Seanchan are a vast and powerful empire whose civilization has developed at a distance from the primary continent of the series. Their culture enslaves female channelers, who they believe are too dangerous to be free. Such channelers, known as &quot;damane&quot;, are collared with a &quot;ter&#x27;angreal&quot; called an &quot;a&#x27;dam&quot;, which allows women known as &quot;sul&#x27;dam&quot; to harness and control their channeling power. As the Seanchan invade, they use the &quot;a&#x27;dam&quot; to enslave any Aes Sedai they can. Also opposing the Aes Sedai are the Children of the Light, or Whitecloaks, a quasi-religious, militarized order bent on destroying anyone who channels the One Power, believing they are servants of the Shadow. In Shara, channelers are known as Ayyad, and isolate themselves in special communities. The females, who secretly control the monarchy, cultivate a bloodline of channelers by using male Ayyad as uneducated breeding stock and executing them by age 21.

The Aiel are a fierce warrior race who live in the Three-fold Land, called the Aiel Waste by outsiders, an inhospitable desert region located between the Westlands and Shara. They are tall, with characteristic pale eyes, and red or blond hair. There are 12 Aiel clans, plus the extinct Jenn Aiel, who built the city of Rhuidean, a repository of Aiel history and culture. The Maidens of the Spear are an all-female warrior society among the Aiel. Female Aiel who can channel the One Power or navigate &quot;Tel&#x27;aran&#x27;rhiod&quot;, the World of Dreams, do not join the Aes Sedai, instead becoming known as Wise Ones. The Aiel await a prophesied &quot;Chief of Chiefs&quot;, whom they call the &quot;Car&#x27;a&#x27;carn&quot;, who will unite and rule all the clans.

The Ogier are a hirsute, wide-featured and immensely tall and strong species of humanoid known for their proficiency in woodwork and masonry. Though physically intimidating, they are peaceful, intelligent and interested in historical and genealogical study. The Ogier also possess a unique ability called treesinging, whereby they stimulate the growth and healing of trees and plants by singing to them. They live in sanctuaries called &quot;steddings&quot;, in which the One Power is inaccessible. After the Breaking of the World, male channelers who sought sanctuary with the Ogier thanked them by creating the Ways, a series of paths through an alternate dimension that connected Ogier communities. Stone doorways called Waygates, placed outside each &quot;stedding&quot;, were used to travel long distances quickly. In the millennia that followed, however, the Ways were corrupted by a malevolent force known as the Machin Shin, or Black Wind, which attacks travelers.

The Tinkers, or &quot;Tuatha&#x27;an&quot;, are a nomadic group of people who travel continuously and widely in brightly colored wagons, believing this is the only way to remain safe. They follow the pacifistic Way of the Leaf, which eschews violence. The Tuatha&#x27;an&#x27;s main purpose has evolved to searching for &quot;The Song&quot;, lost during the Breaking of the World, which they claim they will know when they find it. The Sea Folk, or &quot;Atha&#x27;an Miere&quot;, are dark-skinned people with complex customs who live on ships and on islands in the Sea of Storms. They only appear on the mainland to trade goods, and Sea Folk porcelain sculptures, delicate and graceful objects of art, are highly prized by mainlanders. Unknown to any but the &quot;Atha&#x27;an Miere&quot;, the fabled porcelain is created by the Amayar, a group of island dwelling people protected by the Sea Folk as a solemn duty since the Breaking of the World. The Amayar adhere to the Water Way, a pacifistic way of life akin to the Way of the Leaf practiced by the Tuatha&#x27;an.

=== The Dark One ===
Humans seduced by promises of power and immortality to serve the Dark One are known as Darkfriends. The increasing influence of the Dark One has also introduced an array of creatures called Shadowspawn. Trollocs are brutal, humanoid monsters with animal senses who kill with pleasure and eat all meat, including humans. They are led by the Myrddraal, or Fades, terrifying and deadly creatures without eyes who can disappear in shadow but will not cross running water. Appearing human and designed to target channelers, &quot;gholam&quot; are constructs which possess superhuman strength, are impervious to harm and immune to the One Power, and feed on blood. Grey Men, or the Soulless, are humans who have sacrificed their souls to become drab assassins with the ability to pass completely unnoticed. Draghkar are flying, vampiric creatures that devour the souls of their prey. Darkhounds are otherworldly, doglike beasts the size of small horses, with acidic, poison saliva. They regenerate when wounded or dismembered, and can only be destroyed by balefire, a weapon of the One Power which erases the target from existence, retroactively through time.

The most significant minions of the Shadow are the Forsaken, a group of male and female channelers from the Second Age, or the Age of Legends, who are among the most powerful to have ever lived. Calling themselves &quot;Those Chosen to Rule the World Forever&quot;, they pledged their loyalty to the Dark One in exchange for power and immortality. In turn, the Dark One granted them access to the True Power, his exclusive equivalent of the One Power which is not divided by gender, and is more chaotic. Use of the True Power manifests as &quot;saa&quot;, black flecks moving across the eyes of the channeler, increasing in number in tandem with increased channeling. The more powerful among the Forsaken vie to be raised above the others to the position of &quot;nae&#x27;blis&quot;, the Dark One&#x27;s second-in-command. The thirteen Forsaken—Aginor, Asmodean, Balthamel, Be&#x27;lal, Demandred, Graendal, Ishamael, Lanfear, Mesaana, Moghedien, Rahvin, Sammael and Semirhage—were imprisoned with the Dark One at Shayol Ghul at the end of the Second Age. Three thousand years later near the end of the Third Age, the Aes Sedai learn that the prophesied channeler known as the Dragon has been reborn, signaling that a final battle with the Dark One is coming. The Seven Seals of the Dark One&#x27;s prison have weakened, and the Forsaken begin to reenter the world, presenting a new threat and paving the way for their master.

=== Backstory ===
In the backstory of the series, the Wheel of Time and the universe were forged at the dawn of time by a deity known as the Creator, simultaneously imprisoning its antithesis, the Dark One. The One Power itself is divided into both male (&quot;saidin&quot;) and female (&quot;saidar&quot;) halves, and originally both genders could wield it. In the Age of Legends, the Aes Sedai was made up of both men and women who could channel. An Aes Sedai experiment inadvertently drilled what would become known as the Bore into the Dark One&#x27;s prison, and his influence began to seep out into the world. In response to the threat of his eventual release, the Wheel produced the Dragon, Lews Therin Telamon, a channeler of immense power. Lews eventually rose to command the Aes Sedai and their allies in the struggle against the Dark One&#x27;s forces. Seven Seals were created, made of an unbreakable substance called &quot;cuendillar&quot;, to be used as focus points to reseal the Dark One&#x27;s prison for good. Lews and a host of 99 male channelers managed to imprison the Forsaken with their master, but at the moment of victory, the Dark One was able to taint &quot;saidin&quot;, driving male channelers insane. Lews killed his friends and family, and then himself. Other male channelers devastated the world with earthquakes and tidal waves, an event called the Breaking of the World, before destroying themselves. The female Aes Sedai guided humanity out of this dark time, living in the shadow of a prophecy that the Dark One would break free from his prison and the Dragon would be reborn to fight him once more. And though the Dragon Reborn is humanity&#x27;s only hope against the Dark One, he would break the world a second time in the process.

==Plot==

In &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; (1990), the arrival of a mysterious noblewoman to the remote village of Emond&#x27;s Field in the Two Rivers precedes an attack on the town by a force of humanoid monsters called Trollocs. The woman reveals herself to be Moiraine Damodred, one of the Aes Sedai, and warns that the servants of the Dark One are seeking one of three young men from the village: Rand al&#x27;Thor, Perrin Aybara and Matrim Cauthon. They leave with Moiraine and her companion, the Warder Lan Mandragoran, and are joined by Egwene al&#x27;Vere, in whom Moiraine sees a potential Aes Sedai; the gleeman Thom Merrilin; and later the Wisdom Nynaeve al&#x27;Meara, a healer who learns she can also channel the One Power. They are pursued by increasing numbers of Trollocs, led by deadly, eyeless Fades, and are separated fleeing the cursed, abandoned city of Shadar Logoth. At the Eye of the World, a sacred pool of untainted &quot;saidin&quot;, Rand&#x27;s defeat of the Forsaken Aginor and Ba&#x27;alzamon convinces Moiraine that he is the prophesied Dragon Reborn.

From then, the story expands and protagonist Rand, as well as the other characters, are frequently split into different groups, pursuing different missions or agendas aimed at furthering the cause of the Dragon Reborn, sometimes thousands of miles apart. Broadly speaking, the original group of characters from the Two Rivers make new allies, gain experience, and become figures of some influence and authority. As they struggle to unite the western kingdoms against the Dark One&#x27;s forces, their task is complicated by rulers of the nations who refuse to give up their authority and by factions such as the Children of the Light, who do not believe in the prophecies, and the Seanchan, the people of a long-lost colony of Artur Hawkwing&#x27;s empire across the western ocean who have returned, believing it is their destiny to conquer the world. The Aes Sedai also become divided between those who believe the Dragon Reborn should be strictly controlled and those who believe he must lead them into battle as he did in the earlier war. As the story expands, new characters representing different factions are introduced; although this expansion of the narrative allows the sheer scale of the growing struggle to be effectively depicted, it has been criticized for slowing the pace of the novels and sometimes reducing the appearances of the original or main cast to extended cameos.

By the sixth novel, &quot;Lord of Chaos&quot; (1994), it has become clear that the Last Battle, triggered when the Dark One is able to exert its influence directly on the world once more, is imminent, as only three Seals (keys to the Dark One&#x27;s prison) are intact. Once the remaining Seals break, the Dark One will be free to touch the world. The Last Battle, &quot;Tarmon Gai&#x27;don&quot;, is depicted in the fourteenth and final novel in the series, &quot;A Memory of Light&quot; (2013).

== Novels ==
In 2002, &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; was repackaged as two volumes with new illustrations for younger readers: &quot;From the Two Rivers&quot;, including an extra chapter (&quot;Ravens&quot;) before the existing prologue; and &quot;To the Blight&quot; with an expanded glossary. In 2004, the same was done with &quot;The Great Hunt&quot;, with the two parts being &quot;The Hunt Begins&quot; and &quot;New Threads in the Pattern&quot;.

== Development ==
=== Writing and conception ===
Jordan started writing &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; in 1984 and did not finish it until late 1988 or early 1989, with characters and storylines changing considerably during the writing process. One early version of the story centered on an older man who discovered relatively late in life that he was the &#x27;chosen one&#x27; who had to save the world. However, Jordan deliberately decided to move closer to the tone and style of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and made the characters younger and less experienced. Once this decision had been made, writing proceeded much more easily and Jordan completed the second volume, &quot;The Great Hunt&quot;, at roughly the same time the first book was published.

Jordan wrote full-time at breakneck speed for the next several years until he completed the seventh volume, &quot;A Crown of Swords&quot;, at which point he slowed down, delivering a book every two years. Fans objected when he took some time off to expand a short story into a prequel novel called &quot;New Spring&quot;, so he decided to shelve his plans for additional prequels in favor of finishing off the last two volumes in the series. He rejected criticisms of the later volumes of the series slowing down in pace in order to concentrate on minor secondary characters at the expense of the main characters from the opening volumes but acknowledged that his structure for the tenth volume, &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot; (where he showed a major scene from the prior book, &quot;Winter&#x27;s Heart&quot;, from the perspective of the main characters that were not involved in the scene), had not worked out as he had planned. &quot;Knife of Dreams&quot;, the eleventh volume, had a much more positive reception from critics and fans alike and Jordan announced the twelfth volume, which he had previously announced would have the working title &quot;A Memory of Light&quot;, would conclude the series. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Jordan had intended for it to be the final book &quot;even if it reaches 2,000 pages.&quot;

===Jordan&#x27;s death, and completion by Sanderson===
Jordan was diagnosed with the terminal heart disease primary amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy in December 2005, and while he intended to finish at least &quot;A Memory of Light&quot; even if the &quot;worse comes to worst,&quot; he made preparations in case he was not able to complete the book: &quot;I&#x27;m getting out notes, so if the worst actually happens, someone could finish &quot;A Memory of Light&quot; and have it end the way I want it to end.&quot;

With Jordan&#x27;s death on 16 September 2007, the conclusion of the series was in question. On 7 December of that year, the publisher Tor Books announced that fantasy author Brandon Sanderson was to finish &quot;A Memory of Light&quot;. Sanderson, a longtime fan of the series, was chosen by Jordan&#x27;s widow Harriet McDougal partly because she liked Sanderson&#x27;s novels and partly because of a eulogy he had written for Jordan. Jordan had prepared extensive notes, which enabled Sanderson to complete the final book.

On 30 March 2009, Tor Books announced that &quot;A Memory of Light&quot; would be split into three volumes, with Brandon Sanderson citing timing and continuity reasons. By his estimate in early 2009, the book would have taken several years to write and would have reached 800,000 words. McDougal doubted that Jordan could have concluded it in a single volume. The three volumes were published from 2009 to 2013, as &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot;, &quot;Towers of Midnight&quot;, and &quot;A Memory of Light&quot;, with the last book using Jordan&#x27;s title.

=== After &quot;A Memory of Light&quot; ===
Prior to his death, Jordan had often discussed adding an additional two prequels and an &#x27;outrigger&#x27; sequel trilogy. In a Q&amp;A following the release of &quot;A Memory of Light&quot;, Sanderson ruled out the completion of these works; Jordan had left very little in the way of notes for these additional novels – only two sentences in the case of the sequel trilogy. Sanderson addressed the subject again in a 2023 blog post, and stated that writing additional &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; works would have gone against the wishes of Robert Jordan.

Two cut portions of &quot;A Memory of Light&quot; were released as short stories in the years following the release of the main book. These were published in &quot;Unfettered&quot; anthologies, part of a charitable endeavour to support authors and artists with medical debt. &quot;River of Souls&quot;, a canonical segment removed from the published book due to pacing, was released in the first volume in 2013. &quot;A Fire in the Ways&quot;, a non-canon alternate sequence of events around the climax of the final book, was included in the third volume in 2019. A glossary to the series, &quot;The Wheel of Time Companion&quot; was released in 2015.

==Themes and influences==
&quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; is a novel from the modern fantasy genre, specifically high fantasy. The book is set in a world that is simultaneously the distant past and distant future of the real world, as a result of time being cyclical rather than linear. The opening of the first book establishes the concept:
: The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose...

Jordan acknowledged the influence of J. R. R. Tolkien, including deliberately modelling the setting of the first chapters on the Shire in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Concepts drawn from monotheistic religions include the duality between good and evil and between &quot;Creator&quot; (Light) and Shai&#x27;tan, &quot;The Dark One&quot; (Shaitan is an Arabic word that, in Islamic contexts, is used as a name for the Devil or Satan). Other influences include Arthurian legends, Norse mythology and Irish mythology, as well as real life history. In addition, Jordan also drew influences from Eastern mythology, which was rare for a Western fantasy series. The concept of a wheel of time was drawn from Hinduism. Versions of the concept include the &quot;Yuga&quot; cycle in Hinduism and &quot;Kalachakra&quot; in Buddhism. The series was also influenced by the concepts of reincarnation and balance, and the symbol of the Aes Sedai resembles the yin and yang. The series also draws inspiration from Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;.

Fate is an important theme to the series. The series explores in great detail the implications of a common fantasy premise, in which an ordinary boy on the verge of adulthood discovers he is fated to lead a major struggle. It also deals with the divide between fate and free will. Some major characters are &quot;ta&#x27;veren&quot;, who have exceptional abilities to influence the course of history in a tumultuous period, but even they can only go so far as permitted by &quot;The Pattern&quot; that is being set by the Wheel of Time.

The series also featured alternative portrayals of the role of gender in society. The nature of magic in its world means that only women can safely use it. This disparity influences the power dynamics at multiple levels of its societies, including familial, communal and political levels; many of its societies are ruled by women.

== Derivative works ==
=== Short stories ===
Jordan wrote two short stories within the franchise in the late 1990s. The first, &quot;The Strike at Shayol Ghul&quot;, predates the main series by several thousand years. It was made available on the Internet and was later published in &quot;The World of Robert Jordan&#x27;s The Wheel of Time&quot;. Jordan also wrote a short story entitled &quot;New Spring&quot;, for the 1998 anthology &quot;Legends&quot; edited by Robert Silverberg. Jordan later expanded this into the stand-alone novel &quot;New Spring&quot; that was published in January 2004.

During Brandon Sanderson&#x27;s work on &quot;A Memory of Light&quot;, two sections of the book were cut and later published as short stories in anthologies. The first, &quot;River of Souls&quot;, was published in &quot;Unfettered: Tales by Masters of Fantasy&quot; (2013). The second, &quot;A Fire Within the Ways&quot; was published in &quot;Unfettered III&quot; in 2019. Unlike &quot;River of Souls&quot;, &quot;A Fire Within the Ways&quot; is not considered canon.

=== Companion books ===
Tor Books published a companion book to the series, entitled &quot;The World of Robert Jordan&#x27;s The Wheel of Time&quot;, in November 1997, which contains much hitherto unrevealed background information about the series including the first maps of the entire world and the Seanchan home continent. Jordan co-authored the book with Teresa Patterson. Jordan ruled the book broadly canonical but stated that it was written from the perspective of an historian within &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; universe and was prone to errors of bias and guesswork.

On 3 November 2015, &quot;The Wheel of Time Companion: The People, Places, and History of the Bestselling Series&quot; was released in hardback format, written by Harriet McDougal, Alan Romanczuk, and Maria Simons from Tor Books. Alan Romanczuk and Maria Simons were Robert Jordan&#x27;s editorial assistants. The book is an encapsulating glossary of the entire series. The authors began compiling material for the volume as early as 2005, and the final book was released after the series&#x27; conclusion.

&quot;Origins of The Wheel of Time&quot; by Michael Livingston was released on 8 November 2022.

=== Comic books ===
In 2004, Jordan sold the film, television, video game, and comic rights to the series to production company Red Eagle Entertainment. Dabel Brothers began adapting the series in comic book form, starting with the prequel &quot;New Spring&quot; in July 2005. The series initially ran on a monthly schedule, but then went on a three-year hiatus after the fifth issue. Red Eagle cited delays and changes to the creative team on the DB Pro end. The final three issues were ultimately completed and published in 2009–10.
In 2009 Dabel moved on to their adaptation of the first book of the series proper, &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;. On 17 March 2009, they showcased ten pages of art from the prelude to the series &quot;The Wheel of Time: Eye of the World #0 – Dragonmount&quot; on their website. Dynamite Entertainment published 35 issues of &quot;Robert Jordan&#x27;s The Wheel of Time: The Eye of the World&quot; comic book series, which concluded in March 2013.

When asked in a 2013 interview about whether the comics would continue their run, Harriet McDougal replied &quot;Well, eventually, [we&#x27;ll] do the whole thing, unless it stops selling in a dreadful way. In other words, I don&#x27;t really know.&quot; The 43 &quot;New Spring&quot; and &quot;Eye of the World&quot; comics were later collected together and released as a series of six graphic novels, the last of which was released in February 2015.

Dynamite began publishing the comic adaptation &quot;Robert Jordan&#x27;s The Wheel of Time: The Great Hunt&quot; in November 2023.

=== Games ===
There is a &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; MUD, identified as such or by the initialism &quot;WoTMUD&quot;, which is based on a world like that of the Wheel of Time but set in a time frame around 30 world years prior. It has been in operation almost continuously since 1993. Notably, the &quot;WoTMUD&quot; had gained written permission from the author to use his creation including all but major characters.

A computer game named &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; was released in 1999. Over the course of the game, Aes Sedai must track down a robber following an assault on the White Tower, and prevent the Dark One from being released prematurely. She eventually learns of and executes a long-forgotten ritual at Shayol Ghul to ensure the Dark Lord remains sealed within the prison. While Jordan was consulted in the creation of the game, he did not write the storyline himself.

Starting in 1999, Precedence Entertainment released three sets of &quot;The Wheel of Time Collectible Card Game&quot;.

&quot;The Wheel of Time Roleplaying Game&quot; was released in 2001 from Wizards of the Coast using the d20 rules developed for the third edition of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game. The game had a single adventure module published in 2002, &quot;Prophecies of the Dragon&quot;. Shortly after the release of the adventure book Wizards of the Coast announced they would not be releasing any further products for the game. Robert Jordan cited some problems with the roleplaying game, such as storyline details in the adventure module that contradicted the books.

In early 2009 EA Games announced that they had bought the rights for a MMORPG, with the plan to publish it through the EA Partners-Program. The following year Obsidian Entertainment announced that they would be working on the project, for a PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC release. However, the project was seemingly dropped around 2014.

=== Television and film ===
==== Early attempts ====
In a 2000 chat on CNN.com, Robert Jordan mentioned that NBC had purchased an option to do a miniseries of &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;. But he expressed doubts that the series would be made stating &quot;key people involved in getting that contract together have left NBC.&quot; The series was optioned by Universal Pictures in 2008 for film adaptations, with plans to adapt &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; as the first film. Neither project ultimately emerged.

In February 2015, Red Eagle Entertainment paid air time to cable network FXX to air &quot;Winter Dragon&quot;, a low-budget 22-minute pilot for a potential &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; series that allowed Red Eagle to hold on to the rights to the series. The pilot, based on the prologue to &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;, starred Max Ryan as Lews Therin Thelamon and Billy Zane as Ishamael and aired after midnight with no announcements or publicity. Harriet McDougal initially stated she was unaware of the show ahead of time, and that the film rights to &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; were set to revert to the Bandersnatch Group, her company, a few days later on 11 February 2015. Her comments triggered a slander lawsuit with Red Eagle, which was ultimately dismissed during settlement talks that July. In an interview with &quot;io9&quot;, Red Eagle Entertainment&#x27;s CEO Rick Selvage stated &quot;it was more of an [issue of] getting it on the air.&quot; A spokesman for FXX stated that the channel was paid to air the show, but Selvage hinted that it was indeed produced with a future series in mind. &quot;We think there&#x27;s huge demand for the television series internationally, and we&#x27;re looking forward to producing it and getting it out in the marketplace.&quot; On 29 April 2016, Harriet McDougal confirmed that the legal issues had been resolved and that a television series was in development.

==== Amazon Prime Video series ====

A new adaptation of the series was announced on 20 April 2017, produced by Sony Pictures Television in association with Red Eagle Entertainment and Radar Pictures, with Rafe Judkins as showrunner and executive producer. In February 2018, Amazon Studios announced a deal with Sony Pictures Television to co-develop the series for distribution on its streaming service Amazon Prime Video. The series was formally greenlit in October 2018. Principal photography for the first season began on 16 September 2019, was halted in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but had resumed by April 2021 and concluded in May 2021. On 20 May 2021, Amazon renewed the series for a second season ahead of the series premiere. &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; premiered on 19 November 2021. Filming for the second season began on 19 July 2021, and concluded in February 2022. On 21 July 2022, ahead of the second-season premiere, Amazon renewed the series for a third season. The second season premiered on 1 September 2023, and combined elements from both &quot;The Great Hunt&quot; (1990) and &quot;The Dragon Reborn&quot; (1991), the second and third books in the series. The third season will cover the fourth and fifth books, &quot;The Shadow Rising&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Fires of Heaven&quot; (1993).

== Reception ==
The eighth through fourteenth novels in the series each reached number one on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. After its completion, the series was nominated for a Hugo Award. , the series has sold over 90 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling epic fantasy series since &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

=== Fan culture ===
Many fans of &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; attend Dragon Con, which had an exclusive &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; content track from 2001 through 2012. &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; now has its own annual convention, JordanCon, which has been held annually in Atlanta, Georgia, since 2009. The 2020 convention was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, it took place over the Internet, some aspects being held through the use of the Zoom platform. The 2023 convention in April was the 15th anniversary of the founding of JordanCon.

A new convention titled &quot;WoT&quot;Con took place from 8–10 July 2022, in Dublin, OH. This convention was created to be dedicated to the world of &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; in all media aspects: novels, social media, and the television series. The second convention took place 14–16 July 2023.

<doc id="42572" wikidata="Q477994" url="?curid=42572" title="The Eye of the World">
<text>The Eye of the World is a high fantasy novel by American writer Robert Jordan, the first book of &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; series. It was published by Tor Books and released on 15 January 1990. The original unabridged audiobook is read by Michael Kramer and Kate Reading. A later unabridged edition is read by Rosamund Pike. Upon first publication, &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; consisted of one prologue and 53 chapters, with an additional prologue authored upon re-release titled &quot;Ravens&quot;.
The book was a critical and commercial success. Critics praised the tone and themes, while its similarity to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was both lauded and criticized.

On 2 January 2002, &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; was re-released as two separate books aimed at a young adult market, with larger text and a handful of illustrations. These were &quot;From the Two Rivers&quot; and &quot;To the Blight&quot;. The former included an additional prologue entitled &quot;Ravens&quot;, focusing on Egwene al&#x27;Vere. The American Library Association put &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; on its 2003 list of Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults.

After the release of &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; television series, &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; made the January 2022 &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list in the mass market category and was number one on the audio fiction list.

==Plot==
The arrival of a mysterious noblewoman to the remote village of Emond&#x27;s Field in the Two Rivers precedes an attack on the town by a force of humanoid monsters called Trollocs. The woman reveals herself to be Moiraine Damodred, one of the Aes Sedai, and warns that the servants of the Dark One are seeking one of three young men from the village: Rand al&#x27;Thor, Perrin Aybara and Matrim Cauthon. They leave with Moiraine and her companion, the Warder Lan Mandragoran, and are joined by Egwene al&#x27;Vere, in whom Moiraine sees a potential Aes Sedai; the gleeman Thom Merrilin; and later the Wisdom Nynaeve al&#x27;Meara, a healer who learns she can also channel the One Power. Pursued by increasing numbers of Trollocs, the travellers take refuge in the abandoned city of Shadar Logoth, where Mat steals a cursed dagger, thus becoming infected by the malevolent Mashadar.

While escaping the city the travelers are separated; Rand, Mat, and Thom travel by boat to Whitebridge, where Thom is lost allowing Rand and Mat to escape a Myrddraal, the deadly, eyeless creatures who lead the Trollocs. In Caemlyn, Rand befriends an Ogier named Loial. Trying to catch a glimpse of the recently captured False Dragon, Rand befriends Elayne Trakand, heir apparent to the throne of Andor, and her brothers Gawyn Trakand and Galad Damodred. Rand is then taken before Queen Morgase, her Aes Sedai advisor, Elaida; and Captain-General of the Queen&#x27;s Guard Gareth Bryne, and released without charge, in spite of Elaida&#x27;s grave pronouncements regarding Rand.

Egwene and Perrin are guided separately to Caemlyn by Elyas Machera, a man who can communicate telepathically with wolves and who claims that Perrin can do the same. The three run afoul of the Children of the Light, where Perrin kills two for the death of a wolf at their hands and is sentenced to death. Moiraine, Lan, and Nynaeve rescue Egwene and Perrin, and all are reunited with Rand and Mat. Thereafter Moiraine determines that Mat must travel to Tar Valon, the Aes Sedai&#x27;s center of power, to overcome the influence of Shadar Logoth.

Loial warns Moiraine of a threat to the Eye of the World, a pool of Saidin untouched by the Dark One&#x27;s influence, which is confirmed by vivid and disturbing dreams Mat, Rand, and Perrin have had. The Eye of the World is protected by Someshta (the Green Man) and contains one of the seven seals on the Dark One&#x27;s prison, the Dragon banner of Lews Therin Telamon, and the Horn of Valere. At the civilized world&#x27;s border, the group enters the Blight (the polluted region under the Dark One&#x27;s control) to protect the Eye. After a pursuit, they meet the Green Man and he reveals the Eye. The group is then confronted by the Forsaken Aginor and Balthamel. As the battle ensues, Balthamel and the Green Man slay each other. Soon after, Rand defeats Aginor and uses the Eye to decimate the Trolloc army and defeat Ba&#x27;alzamon. As a result, Moiraine concludes that Rand is the Dragon Reborn, but her opinion and all other details of the final battle are kept from all the male members of the group except Lan.

==Characters==

* Rand al&#x27;Thor: A shepherd from the Two Rivers, and, unbeknownst to him, the Dragon Reborn. He was one of the three boys Moiraine deduced might be the Dragon Reborn. He, Mat, and Perrin are considered &quot;ta&#x27;veren&quot;. He can channel saidin, and demonstrated that by unconsciously healing Bela (his horse) when they were fleeing from Myrddraal and Trollocs. He also saved the forces of Fal Dara through his dreams. He is the (adopted) son of Tam and Kari al&#x27;Thor. He and Mat were separated from the rest of the group during the novel. He is described as having grey eyes, &quot;reddish&quot; hair, and being extremely stubborn. 
* Matrim Cauthon: A shepherd from the Two Rivers, a prankster, considered by most to be untrustworthy, except for his friends. He was one of the three boys Moiriaine deduced might be the Dragon Reborn. He, Rand, and Perrin are considered &quot;ta&#x27;veren&quot;. He steals a dagger from the cursed city Shadar Logoth, and is thus tainted by the evil that dwells there. His ta&#x27;veren functions in a way as to provide him luck. 
* Perrin Aybara: A blacksmith from the Two Rivers. He was one of the three boys Moiraine deduced might be the Dragon Reborn. He is a &quot;Wolfbrother&quot;, someone who can communicate with wolves, as well as becoming more wolf-like in his abilities, demeanor, and even appearance, with &quot;burnished golden&quot; eyes that are luminous in the dark. He, Rand, and Mat are considered &quot;ta&#x27;veren&quot;. He and Egwene were separated from the rest of the group during the novel, but later meet up with them again. 
* Egwene al&#x27;Vere: A woman from the Two Rivers, the apprentice to Nynaeve al&#x27;Meara, the Wisdom, and having a close relationship with Rand al&#x27;Thor, Matrim Cauthon, and Perrin Aybara. She is chosen by Moiraine to train in Tar Valon because she has the &quot;spark&quot; that allows her to channel. She and Perrin were separated from the rest of the group during the novel, but later meet up with them again. She is described as having &quot;huge brown eyes&quot;, and dark hair.
* Nynaeve al&#x27;Meara: A woman from the Two Rivers, the &quot;Wisdom&quot; of Emond&#x27;s Field, the youngest ever chosen. She leaves to return Rand, Perrin, Mat, and Egwene to the village, but journeys with them once she realizes she cannot convince them, and that she can channel. She, Moiraine, and Lan are separated from the rest of the group. During this time, she begins developing feelings for Lan. She is described as having a temper and being especially headstrong. 
==Themes and allusions==
Robert Jordan has stated that he consciously intended the early chapters of &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; to evoke the Shire of Middle-earth in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Despite their similarities, these two works also differ in themes. For instance, both Jordan and Tolkien created narratives that explored power. However, &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; discussed how it can be deployed whereas &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was more focused on its renunciation. Rand needed to wield his power so he could successfully fight an emerging war with the Dark One. This theme is antithetical to Frodo&#x27;s quest to destroy the ring of Sauron, a source of immense power that also corrupted its wearer.

==Reception==
PBS&#x27;s The Great American Read named &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; &quot;one of America&#x27;s best-loved novels,&quot; coming in at #62 on their top 100 list.

<text>The Great Hunt is a fantasy novel by American author Robert Jordan, the second book of &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; series. It was published by Tor Books and released on November 15, 1990. &quot;The Great Hunt&quot; consists of a prologue and 50 chapters. In 2004 &quot;The Great Hunt&quot; was re-released as two separate books, &quot;The Hunt Begins&quot; and &quot;New Threads in the Pattern&quot;.

The story features young heroes Rand al&#x27;Thor, Mat Cauthon, and Perrin Aybara, who join Shienaren soldiers in a quest to retrieve the Horn of Valere. At the same time, Egwene al&#x27;Vere, Nynaeve al&#x27;Meara, and Elayne Trakand go to the White Tower in Tar Valon to learn Aes Sedai ways. Finally, an exotic army invades the western coast.

==Plot summary==

===Prologue===
Ba&#x27;alzamon presides over a clandestine meeting. In addition to Forsaken and Darkfriends, Ba&#x27;alzamon&#x27;s known subordinates, the meeting includes two Aes Sedai and a Questioner of the Children of the Light. In this meeting, Rand al&#x27;Thor, Mat Cauthon, and Perrin Aybara are all mentioned.

===The Hunt Begins===
At Fal Dara in Shienar, following the events in &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;, Lan Mandragoran instructs Rand in sword fighting. Mat Cauthon&#x27;s condition worsens through his psychic attachment to a parasitic dagger from Shadar Logoth. Darkfriend Padan Fain is imprisoned. The Amyrlin Seat, Siuan Sanche, arrives, and identifies Rand al&#x27;Thor as the Dragon Reborn. At the same time, through their private conversations it is revealed that they have a secret plan for the Dragon Reborn and have been close friends for many years. Fain is subsequently freed by Darkforces who invade the castle in Fal Dara, stealing the Horn of Valere and the tainted dagger.

Rand, Perrin Aybara, and Mat accompany a Shienaran party southbound in pursuit, under the leadership of Lord Ingtar Shinowa and guided by a tracker named Hurin who can literally smell past violence. The Amyrlin departs for Tar Valon, taking Nynaeve al&#x27;Meara and Egwene al&#x27;Vere for Aes Sedai training. Moiraine Damodred breaks off, unbidden, to seek answers. In Tar Valon, Nynaeve and Egwene befriend daughter-heir Elayne Trakand and the clairvoyant Min Farshaw. Nynaeve passes the test to become Accepted, a rank in the White Tower below Aes Sedai and above Novice.
Rand, the Ogier Loial, and Hurin sleep near a stone. They awaken, separated from the Shienaran party, and transported to an alternate world similar to their own, but deserted and distorted. Rand suspects that he activated the stone by unconsciously channeling &quot;saidin&quot; in his sleep. (Rand&#x27;s struggle to accept his channeling ability is a recurring element in the novel.) However, Egwene dreams of a woman standing over Rand while he slept, whose &quot;eyes seemed to shine like the moon&quot;.

In this alternate world, Rand meets Ba&#x27;alzamon and has a heron&#x27;s image (the crest of his sword) branded into his palm in a fight. Rand and Hurin rescue the mysterious but beautiful Selene from monsters, and return by a different portal stone to their own world, ahead of Fain&#x27;s and Ingtar&#x27;s groups. When Fain does arrive, Rand and Loial sneak into his camp and retrieve the Horn and dagger. Still behind, and at a loss to explain Rand&#x27;s disappearance, Lord Ingtar&#x27;s group pursue Fain with the aid of Perrin, who uses his telepathic ability to communicate with wolves, which in turn can track Fain&#x27;s Trollocs (the Dark One&#x27;s bestial foot-soldiers).

Rand&#x27;s party journeys to Cairhien, where Rand finds gleeman Thom Merrilin, whom he thought dead after the events in &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;. Rand and Loial are attacked by trollocs and, during their escape, damage the Chapter House of the Illuminator&#x27;s Guild, a society retaining knowledge of fireworks.

Rand receives unwanted, high-profile invitations from House Damodred and from the King. Hurin is attacked at the inn by Fain&#x27;s forces, and the Horn and dagger are again stolen. Ingtar&#x27;s group arrives in Cairhien. Hurin traces the Darkfriends to Barthanes Damodred&#x27;s manor. Using the now-valuable invitation, the path is traced further to a Waygate in the premises. However, they are prevented from pursuit by Machin Shin. Via Barthanes, Padan Fain tells them that he is taking the Horn to the port city of Falme in Toman Head. Thom&#x27;s apprentice Dena is murdered for Thom&#x27;s involvement with Rand.

===To Toman Head===
The invading Seanchan and their exotic beasts have occupied Falme. Fain gives the Horn to High Lord Turak of the Seanchan. Geofram Bornhald, leader of the zealous religious group Children of the Light, also known as the Whitecloaks, is preparing to attack the Seanchan.

Ingtar&#x27;s group tries a different Waygate in a nearby Ogier stedding, but they find Machin Shin there too. Rand takes them via a portal stone instead, but they lose months of time. At the White Tower, Liandrin Guirale lures Egwene and Nynaeve, along with an accompanying Elayne and Min, to Toman Head via the Ways, handing them over to the Seanchan. Egwene is collared with an &quot;a&#x27;dam&quot;, a device used by the Seanchan to control channelers, while Min is held hostage. Nynaeve and Elayne escape.

Elayne and Nynaeve rescue Egwene from the Seanchan and attempt to flee the city. Meanwhile, Ingtar, Rand, Hurin, Mat, and Perrin enter Falme and retrieve the Horn and dagger, Rand slaying Turak. Ingtar reveals himself as a Darkfriend, but redeems himself when he dies fighting. However, the Whitecloaks attack the Seanchan, leaving Rand&#x27;s group trapped perilously between the advancing lines. Mat blows the Horn of Valere, summoning dead heroes, including Artur Hawkwing. The banner of the Dragon Reborn is unfurled, and they ride to battle against the Seanchan.

Ba&#x27;alzamon appears, and he and Rand fight, the duel projected into the air above Falme. Rand allows himself to be stabbed with Ba&#x27;alzamon&#x27;s staff, giving him an opening to stab Ba&#x27;alzamon through the heart with his heron-mark sword.

The battle over and the Seanchan defeated, Rand is found by Min and hauled into a bed to recuperate. Selene arrives, touches the sleeping Rand, reveals herself to be the Forsaken Lanfear, and disappears. When Rand awakens, he finds Ingtar&#x27;s army under the dragon&#x27;s banner, and they ask to pledge to him.

<text>A Crown of Swords is a fantasy novel by American author Robert Jordan, the seventh book of &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;. It was published by Tor Books and released on May 15, 1996. &quot;A Crown of Swords&quot; consists of a prologue and 41 chapters.

==Plot summary==
&quot;A Crown of Swords&quot; has three primary plotlines:

* Rand al&#x27;Thor, the Dragon Reborn, prepares to attack the Forsaken Sammael in Illian while enjoying life with his friend, Min Farshaw, and attempting to quell the rebellion by nobles in Cairhien, during which Padan Fain severely injures him. After recovering, Rand, accompanied by Asha&#x27;man, defeats Sammael in Shadar Logoth, where Sammael is destroyed by Mashadar. Rand then takes the crown of Illian: formerly the Laurel Crown, but now called the &#x27;Crown of Swords&#x27;.
* Egwene al&#x27;Vere and Siuan Sanche attempt to manipulate the Aes Sedai in Salidar against Elaida&#x27;s Aes Sedai in the White Tower. Investigating Myrelle Berengari, Egwene exploits the transfer of Lan Mandragoran&#x27;s Warder bond from Moiraine to Myrelle, to force Myrelle and Nisao to swear fealty to her.
* In the city of Ebou Dar in Altara, Elayne Trakand, Nynaeve al&#x27;Meara, Aviendha, and Mat Cauthon search for a &quot;ter&#x27;angreal&quot;, the Bowl of the Winds, to break the unnatural heat brought by the Dark One&#x27;s manipulation of climate.

<doc id="42575" wikidata="Q2264817" url="?curid=42575" title="Winter's Heart">
<text>Winter&#x27;s Heart is a fantasy novel by American author Robert Jordan, the ninth book of his series &quot;Wheel of Time&quot;. It was published by Tor Books and released on November 7, 2000. Upon its release, it immediately rose to the #1 position on the &quot;New York Times&quot; hardcover fiction bestseller list, making it the second &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; book to reach the #1 position on that list. It remained on the list for the next two months. &quot;Winter&#x27;s Heart&quot; consists of a prologue and 35 chapters.

The book&#x27;s title is a reference to the increasing coldness of Rand al&#x27;Thor&#x27;s personality and to the return of winter following the reversal in the previous book, &quot;The Path of Daggers&quot;, of the unnatural heat caused by the Dark One&#x27;s manipulation of the climate.

&quot;Winter&#x27;s Heart&quot; was the first &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; book for which the prologue, entitled &quot;Snow&quot;, was first sold as an ebook in advance of the physical release of the book. &quot;Snow&quot; was released by the Scribner imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster in September 2000, two months before the publication of &quot;Winter&#x27;s Heart&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Many of the events of &quot;Winter&#x27;s Heart&quot; take place simultaneously with the events of the next book, &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot;. Perrin Aybara and his followers pursue the Shaido Aiel who kidnapped his wife, Faile Bashere, while Elayne Trakand attempts to suppress rebellious nobles.

Mat Cauthon is trapped in the city of Ebou Dar in Altara, under Seanchan occupation. His escape is disrupted by a Seanchan noblewoman named Tuon, the heir to the Seanchan Crystal Throne; and Mat, having heard a prophecy of his own marriage to the Daughter of the Nine Moons, referring to Tuon herself, kidnaps her during his and his men&#x27;s escape from the city.

Rand al&#x27;Thor is appointed a Warder by Elayne Trakand, Aviendha, and Min Farshaw; and later kills most of the Asha&#x27;man traitors in Far Madding. Lan also kills Toram Riatin in a duel. Caught by guards, Rand is imprisoned for a short time but is set free by Cadsuane and the other Aes Sedai. Rand and Nynaeve al&#x27;Meara Travel to Shadar Logoth. There, defended by Cadsuane Melaidhrin&#x27;s Aes Sedai and loyal Asha&#x27;man against the Forsaken, Rand and Nynaeve use the Choedan Kal, two giant &quot;sa&#x27;angreal&quot;, to cleanse &quot;saidin&quot; of the Dark One&#x27;s influence. In the process, Shadar Logoth, the access key to the female Choedan Kal, and the female Choedan Kal itself are destroyed.

==Critical reception==
For the &quot;Centre Daily Times&quot;, Jacob W. Michaels noted that, by this book, the series is &quot;beginning to drag&quot; due to the complexity of the story and the number of main characters. Despite entire chapters dedicated to backstory, one of the primary characters, rebel leader Egwene, is almost entirely ignored and separated from the plot, which Michaels complained was an ongoing trend of at least one overlooked character in each book in the series. He did say that the final scene of the book, which changed and recontextualized much of the prior works, was worth its entry in the series, but only for those already invested from reading the rest of the books.

<doc id="42578" wikidata="Q2194001" url="?curid=42578" title="Mrs. Miniver (character)">
<text>Mrs. Miniver is a fictional British housewife created by Jan Struther in 1937 for a series of newspaper columns for &quot;The Times&quot;. The Mrs. Miniver story was later adapted into a film of the same name and starred Greer Garson in the titular role for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress.

==Origin==
In the 1930s, Jan Struther started to write for &quot;Punch&quot; magazine, and this brought her to the attention of &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, where Peter Fleming asked her to write a series of columns for the paper, about &quot;an ordinary sort of woman who leads an ordinary sort of life – rather like yourself&quot;. The resulting character that she created, Mrs. Kay Miniver, a British housewife living in Chelsea, proved a huge success from the character&#x27;s inception in 1937, and the columns were subsequently published in book form in 1939. On the outbreak of war, this book became the basis for a patriotic and sentimental American film, &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot;, released in 1942, which won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

&quot;The Times&quot; columns were short reflections on everyday life, based in part on Struther&#x27;s own family and experiences. While the columns started out as lighthearted domestic scenes where the outside world barely intruded, the approach of World War II slowly brought darker global concerns into Mrs. Miniver&#x27;s world. One of the more memorable pieces appears near the middle of the series, where the Minivers get gas masks.

==Book publication==
The columns were first published in book form in 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II. Struther stopped the regular newspaper columns that year, but wrote a series of letters from Mrs. Miniver, expanding on the character&#x27;s wartime experiences. These were published in later editions.

The book became an enormous success, especially in the United States, where Struther went on a lecture tour shortly after the book&#x27;s release.

The U.S. was still officially neutral, but as war with Nazi Germany intensified in Europe, the tribulations of the Miniver family engaged the sympathy of the American public sufficiently that President Franklin D. Roosevelt credited it for hastening America&#x27;s involvement in the war. Winston Churchill is said to have claimed that it had done more for the Allied cause than a flotilla of battleships. Churchill is further quoted by Bernard Wasserstein in his book, &quot;Barbarism and Civilization,&quot; as saying that the book (and later the film) was worth &quot;six divisions of war effort.&quot;

In 1942, when the film came out, Roosevelt ordered it rushed to theaters.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
The film adaptation of &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; was produced by MGM in 1942 with Greer Garson in the leading role and William Wyler directing. Under the influence of the American Office of War Information, the film attempted to undermine Hollywood&#x27;s prewar depiction of Britain as a glamorous bastion of social privilege, anachronistic habits and snobbery in favour of more democratic, modern images. To this end, the social status enjoyed by the Miniver family in the print version was downgraded and increased attention was given to the erosion of class barriers under the pressures of wartime.
In 1942, the film won an Oscar in the Best Picture category and both Greer Garson and Teresa Wright won an Oscar in the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress categories, respectively.
The film grossed $5,358,000 () in North America (the highest for any MGM film at the time) and $3,520,000 abroad . In Britain, it was named the top box office attraction of 1942. 555 of the 592 film critics polled by American magazine &quot;Film Daily&quot; named it the best film of 1942.

A sequel to &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot;, &quot;The Miniver Story&quot; was made by the same studio in 1950 with Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon reprising their original roles. The characters were based on those in the original film, but their creator, Jan Struther, did not participate in the sequel.

===Radio===
In 1944, CBS Radio presented a Friday-night series named &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; starring Judith Evelyn and Karl Swenson. They were soon replaced by Gertrude Warner and John Moore. But the show only lasted 9 months.

===Television===

In 1960, CBS Television presented Mrs. Miniver starring Maureen O&#x27;Hara as Mrs Miniver, Leo Genn as Clem Miniver, Juliet Mills and Keir Dullea.
The adaptation was by George Bart and was directed by Marc Daniels.

<doc id="42580" wikidata="Q124993" url="?curid=42580" title="Leopoldo Galtieri">
<text>Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri Castelli (15 July 1926 12 January 2003) was an Argentine general and the &quot;de facto&quot; President of Argentina from December 1981 to June 1982. Galtieri ruled as a military ruler during the National Reorganization Process as leader of the Third Junta with Jorge Anaya and Basilio Lami Dozo.

Galtieri was chief combat engineer of the Argentine Army and a supporter of the 1976 military coup d&#x27;état which helped him become commander-in-chief of the army in 1980. Galtieri overthrew Roberto Viola, was appointed president, and established Argentina as a strong Cold War ally of NATO and the United States, while introducing fiscally conservative economic reforms, and increasing Argentine covert support for the anti-communist Contras guerrillas during the Nicaraguan civil war. In domestic policy, General Galtieri continued the Dirty War with the 601 Intelligence Battalion death squad reporting directly to him. 

Galtieri&#x27;s declining popularity due to his human rights abuses and the worsening economic stagnation caused him to order an invasion of the Falkland Islands in April 1982. Galtieri was removed from power after Argentina’s defeat by the British armed forces in the Falklands War in June, which led to the restoration of democracy and, in 1986, his court martial prosecution and conviction for war crimes and other offenses. Galtieri was pardoned by Carlos Menem in 1989 and lived in obscurity until his arrest for new charges shortly before his death in 2003.

==Early life==
Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri was born on 15 July 1926 in Caseros, Buenos Aires Province to working-class Italian Argentine parents Francisco Rosario Galtieri and Nélida Victoria Castelli. In 1943, at 17 years-old, he enrolled at the National Military Academy to study civil engineering, and his early military career was as an officer in the engineering branch of the Argentine Army. As well as rising through the ranks of the military, he continued his studies in engineering until the mid-1950s. In 1949 he graduated from the US Army School of the Americas. In 1958, he became a professor of engineering at the Senior War College.

Galtieri was married to Lucía Noemí Gentili, and the couple had one son and two daughters.

==Rise to power==
In 1975, after more than 25 years as a combat engineer, Galtieri became commander of the Argentine engineering corps. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the March 1976 coup d&#x27;état that overthrew President Isabel Perón and started the self-styled National Reorganisation Process, the establishment of a right-wing military junta government in Argentina. This helped him rise through the ranks, becoming a major general in 1977, and commander-in-chief of the army in 1980 with the rank of lieutenant general. During the junta&#x27;s rule, Congress was suspended, trade unions, political parties, and provincial governments were banned, and in what became known as the Dirty War, between 9,000 and 30,000 people deemed left-wing subversives disappeared from society with torture and mass executions being commonplace. Argentina&#x27;s economy had been in dire condition prior to the coup and recovered for a short time. An impending economic collapse was one of the main justifications for the overthrow of Perón and the civilian government.

In March 1981, Galtieri visited the United States and was warmly received, as the Reagan administration viewed the regime as a against communism. National Security Advisor Richard V. Allen described him as a &quot;majestic general&quot;. An adherent to the Argentine military&#x27;s Cold War-era doctrine of &quot;ideological frontiers&quot;, Galtieri secured his country&#x27;s support for Contra rebel groups opposing the Socialist Sandinista government in Nicaragua during the Nicaraguan Revolution. In August, he sent advisers to help organize the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN, for a time the principal Contra group), as well as training FDN leaders in Argentine bases. His support for this initiative allowed Galtieri to remove a number of rival generals.

==Presidency==

On 22 December 1981, Galtieri was appointed President of Argentina one week after ousting General Roberto Viola, who had been in power since March. Officially Viola resigned due to a health issue and designated Interior Minister Horacio Liendo as his successor. In reality, Viola was removed from power due to his regime&#x27;s inability to reverse the economic crisis which caused infighting within the military.

Galtieri retained direct control of the army whilst President of the governing Military Junta and did not appoint a new commander-in-chief.

===Political policy===

Galtieri instituted limited political reforms which allowed the expression of dissent, and anti-junta demonstrations soon became common, as did agitation for a return to democracy.

===Economic policy===
Galtieri appointed conservative economist and publisher Roberto Alemann as Economy Minister. Alemann inherited an economy in deep recession in the aftermath of José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz&#x27;s economic policies of the late 1970s. Alemann slashed spending, began selling off government-owned industries (with only minor success), enacted a tight monetary policy, and ordered salaries frozen (amid 130% inflation).

The Central Bank Circular 1050, which tied mortgage rates to the value of the US dollar locally, was maintained, however, leading to further deepening of the crisis; GDP fell by 5%, and business investment by 20% over the weakened levels of 1981.

One of Galtieri&#x27;s closest allies, the head of the First Army Corps, General Guillermo Suárez Mason, was named Chairman of Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF), at the time the state petroleum concern, and the largest company of any type in Argentina. Suárez Mason&#x27;s role would contribute to a US$6 billion loss for the company, the largest recorded corporate loss in the world, up to that point.

===Foreign policy===
Galtieri supported the Central Intelligence Agency in its fight against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, while he was warmly welcomed during his visit to the White House. Argentina support became the principal source of funds and training for the Contras during Galtieri&#x27;s tenure.

Argentine military and intelligence cooperation with the Reagan Administration ended in 1982 when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands.

===Falklands War===


By April 1982, Galtieri had been in office for four months and his popularity was low. On 2 April, on his orders, Argentine forces invaded the Falkland Islands, a United Kingdom territory subject to a long-standing Argentine claim.

Initially the invasion was popular in Argentina, and the anti-junta demonstrations were replaced by patriotic demonstrations in support of Galtieri.

Galtieri and most of his government mistakenly believed the United Kingdom would not respond militarily.

The British government led by the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, dispatched a naval task force to retake the islands militarily if Argentina refused to comply with a United Nations resolution demanding an immediate Argentine withdrawal. Argentina did not comply with the resolution which resulted in a surrender to British forces on 14 June 1982.

==Defeat, fall from power, trial and prison==
On 14 June 1982, the Falklands&#x27; capital, Stanley, was retaken by British forces. The fact that an administration ruled by military figures failed to contain the British military response provoked an unprecedented crisis inside the Junta. Galtieri was blamed for the defeat and was removed from power, and he spent the next 18 months at a well-protected country retreat while democracy was restored to Argentina. Along with other members of the former junta, he was arrested in late 1983 and charged in a military court with human rights violations during the Dirty War and with mismanaging the Falklands War. The Argentine Army&#x27;s internal investigation, known as the Rattenbach report after the general who led it, recommended that those responsible for the misconduct of the war be prosecuted under the Code of Military Justice. In 1986 he was sentenced to twelve years in prison.

Galtieri was cleared of the civil rights charges in December 1985, but (together with the Air Force and Navy commanders-in-chief) in May 1986 he was found guilty of mishandling the war and sentenced to prison. All three appealed in a civil court, and the prosecution appealed for heavier sentences. In November 1988 the original sentences were confirmed, and all three commanders were stripped of their rank. In 1989, Galtieri and 39 other officers of the dictatorship received President Carlos Menem&#x27;s pardon.

==Later life, further accusations==
Galtieri was heavily blamed for Argentina&#x27;s defeat in the Falklands War. Following his release from prison, he moved to the Villa Devoto suburb of Buenos Aires, and lived modestly with his wife Lucía. He became a recluse and refused most requests for interviews by journalists, though in a rare interview he stated he had &quot;no regrets&quot; over anything he had done during the Dirty War. He lived on an army pension of 9,000 pesos per month, and attempted to claim a Presidential pension, but a judge denied it. In her ruling, the judge stated that his presidency had been illegal due to his never having been elected, and she also ordered him to pay court costs.
In May 2002, he was invited to the military parade of the Argentine Army for the celebrations of Argentine Army Day (Día del Ejército Argentino): the presence of the former &quot;president de facto&quot; caused a huge controversy in public opinion after he was confronted and questioned by the journalist Martín Ciccioli in the television programme &quot;Kaos en la Ciudad&quot;.

In July 2002, new civil charges were brought concerning the kidnapping of children and the disappearance of 18 leftist sympathizers in the late 1970s (while Galtieri was commander of the Second Army Corps), and the disappearance or death of three Spanish citizens at about the same time. Galtieri faced prosecution with 28 other officials, but due to his poor health, he was allowed to remain at home.

==Death==
Leopoldo Galtieri underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer on 16 August 2002 at a hospital in Buenos Aires. He died there of a heart attack on 12 January 2003, aged 76. His body was interred in a small mausoleum at La Chacarita Cemetery.

<doc id="42583" wikidata="Q54056" url="?curid=42583" title="Sigismund I the Old">
<text>Sigismund I the Old (, ; 1 January 1467 – 1 April 1548) was King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1506 until his death in 1548. Sigismund I was a member of the Jagiellonian dynasty, the son of Casimir IV and younger brother of Kings John I Albert and Alexander I Jagiellon. He was nicknamed &quot;the Old&quot; in later historiography to distinguish him from his son and successor, Sigismund II Augustus. Before ascending to the Polish and Lithuanian thrones, he was Duke of Głogów from 1499, Duke of Opava from 1501, and governor of Silesia from 1504 on behalf of his brother, King Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary.

Sigismund was born in the town of Kozienice in 1467 as the fifth son of Casimir IV and his wife Elizabeth of Austria. He was one of thirteen children and was not expected to assume the throne after his father. Sigismund&#x27;s eldest brother and rightful heir Vladislaus II instead became the King of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia as the successor to George of Poděbrady in Bohemia and then to Matthias Corvinus in Hungary, thus temporarily uniting these kingdoms. When Casimir died, the Polish-Lithuanian realm was divided between the remaining two older sons, with John Albert being crowned King of Poland, and Alexander as Grand Duke of Lithuania. Alexander inherited Poland following John Albert&#x27;s sudden death in 1501. Hence, Sigismund&#x27;s reign only began when he succeeded Alexander to both titles in 1506 at the age of 39.

A capable monarch and a patron of arts, Sigismund established Polish rule over Ducal Prussia and annexed the Duchy of Mazovia with Warsaw, while retaining the nation&#x27;s wealth and prominence in the region. He made sure that his nephew Albert, Duke of Prussia, and Albert&#x27;s Protestant successors would pay feudal homage or tribute to Polish monarchs as a sign of political and diplomatic dependence. This was observed until the Treaty of Bromberg in 1657 when Prussia gained its sovereignty. Sigismund and his commander Jan Amor Tarnowski also defeated Moldavia at Obertyn in 1531, and Muscovy in 1535, thereby strengthening the country&#x27;s eastern borders. His 42-year reign was further marked by decisive contributions to Polish architecture, cuisine, language, and customs, especially at the behest of his second wife, the Italian-born Bona Sforza. Italian styles and fashions dominated at the height of the Polish Renaissance and Polish Golden Age, which developed the Catholic identity of Poland. He was commemorated on a contemporary 200-złoty banknote.

Sigismund was married twice, first to noblewoman Barbara Zápolya from Hungary and then to Bona Sforza, the daughter of Gian Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan. Their only surviving son and the last Jagiellon king, Sigismund Augustus, was made his co-king&quot;vivente rege&quot; in 1529 and formally assumed throne when Sigismund the Old died in 1548.

==Early life and coronation==

Sigismund was the son of King Casimir IV Jagiellon and Elisabeth Habsburg of Austria. He followed his brothers John Albert and Alexander to the Polish throne. Their eldest brother Vladislaus became king of Bohemia, Hungary, and Croatia. Sigismund was christened as the namesake of his maternal great-grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund.

When Casimir died in 1492, Sigismund was his only son without any titles or land. From 1495 to 1496, he petitioned his brother Alexander to provide him with land, and Elisabeth of Austria attempted to install him on the Austrian throne. Both efforts failed. In 1497, King John I Albert, his older brother, led an invasion of Moldavia that was intended to place Sigismund on its throne. This, too, was a disastrous failure. Finally, his eldest brother Vladislaus II, King of Bohemia and Hungary, granted him the duchies of Głogów (1499) and Opava (1501), and in 1504 Sigismund became governor of Silesia and Lower Lusatia.

John I Albert died suddenly in 1501, and was succeeded by Alexander I, who died in 1506. After his death, Sigismund arrived in Vilnius, where he was elected by the Lithuanian Ducal Council on 13 September 1506 as Grand Duke of Lithuania, contrary to the Union of Mielnik (1501), which proposed a joint Polish-Lithuanian election of a monarch. On 8 December 1506, during the session of the Polish Senate in Piotrków, Sigismund was elected King of Poland. He arrived in Kraków on 20 January 1507 and was crowned four days later in Wawel Cathedral by Primate Andrzej Boryszewski.

==Internal politics==

===Crown of the Kingdom of Poland===
The internal situation in Poland was characterised by broad authorisation of the Chamber of Deputies, confirmed and extended in the constitution of &quot;Nihil novi&quot;. During Alexander&#x27;s reign, the law of &quot;Nihil novi&quot; had been instituted, which forbade kings of Poland from enacting laws without the consent of the Sejm. Sigismund had little control over the act, unlike the senators, whom he personally appointed. Eventually, during his reign, Sigismund benefited from the advice of the local nobility, competent ministers in charge of the royal judiciary system, and the wealthy influential treasurers of Kraków. Although he was reluctant to the parliamentary system and political independence of the nobility, he recognised the authority of legal norms, supported legalism and summoned annual sessions of the Sejm, usually obtaining funds on state defence. However he was unsuccessful at attempting to create a permanent fund for defence from the annual income tax. Despite this, in 1527 he established a conscript army and the bureaucracy needed to finance it. He set up the legal codes that formalised serfdom in Poland, placing the peasants into the private estates of nobles.

Likely related to tax matters was an unsuccessful attempt on the life of the king, made on 5 May 1523. The identity of the would-be assassin - who shot the ruler while he was strolling in the evening around the cloisters of the Wawel castle - and his potential supporters was never established. Unclear motives remained after the assassination attempt. Three weeks before the event, Sigismund I introduced a new edict that was very unfavourable and somewhat hostile to the high-ranking nobles and their interests.

Sigismund I achieved several economic successes, including partial debt reduction, separation of accounts of public taxation from the royal treasury, strengthening of the activities of the mint operating in Kraków, and the attempt to organise the processing of income from operating salt mines. Furthermore, he issued a statute for the Armenians (1519) and strongly intended to harmonise the judicial system across the country.

Between 1530 and 1538 the king issued two statutes defining the rules for the selection of the monarch, which permanently established the election &quot;viritim&quot;. The laws held that all social groups, regardless of their wealth, could watch the election process (&quot;unusquisque qui vellet&quot;), and the election was to be free (&quot;electio Regis libera&quot;).

Sigismund successfully organised the agricultural economy, looked after the development of the royal cities and recovered numerous goods of the treasury belonging to the crown that were under lien. During the financial activities, the King received full support of his wife, Queen Bona, who aimed to expand the royal estates by purchasing and improving economic efficiency. In 1514 he set up the Council of Four Lands and put Abraham of Bohemia in charge of it.

===Chicken War Rebellion===

At the start of his reign, King Sigismund I the Old inherited a Kingdom of Poland with a century-long tradition of liberties of the nobility, confirmed in numerous privileges. A rebellion in Lwów widely known as the Chicken War () was an anti-royalist and anti-absolutist rokosz (revolt) by the Polish nobility that occurred in 1537. The derisive name was coined by the magnates, who for the most part supported the King and claimed that the &quot;war&#x27;s&quot; only effect was the near-extinction of the local chickens, eaten by the nobles gathered for the rebellion at Lwów in eastern part of Lesser Poland.

To strengthen his power, Sigismund initiated a set of reforms, establishing a permanent conscription army in 1527 and extending the bureaucratic apparatus necessary to govern the state and finance the army. Supported by his Italian consort Bona Sforza, he began buying up land and issue agriculture reformas to enlarge the royal treasury. He initiated a process of restitution of royal properties, previously pawned or rented to the nobles.

The nobility gathered near the city to meet to a &quot;levée en masse&quot; and called for a military campaign against Moldavia. However, the lesser and middle strata of the nobility organised a revolt to force the King to abandon his risky reforms. The nobles presented him with 36 demands, most notably a cessation of further land acquisitions by Queen Bona, exemption of the nobility from the tithe, confirmation and extension of privileges for nobles and adoption of a law concerning Incompatibilitas — an individual wouldn&#x27;t be able to hold two or more official administrative positions in the country. The role of the Incompatibilitas was to prevent wealthy magnates from usurping too much power at the expense of lesser nobles.

However, the revolt soon transpired that the nobility&#x27;s leaders were divided and that achieving a settlement was almost impossible. Too weak to start a civil war against the King, the protesters finally agreed to what was thought a compromise. Sigismund rejected most of their demands, while accepting the principle of Incompatibilitas the following year and agreeing not to force the election of the future king in &quot;vivente rege&quot;. Thereupon, the nobility returned to their homes having achieved little.

==Foreign politics==

===War with Moscow===
Sigismund was intermittently at war with Vasili III of Muscovy beginning in 1507, before the Polish army was fully under his command. Further tensions escalated when Vasili also discovered that Sigismund was bribing Khan Meñli I Giray to attack the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In December 1512, Muscovite forces marched into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania seeking to capture Smolensk, a major trading center between Russia and Europe. The initial six- and four-week sieges in 1513 were a failure, but the city fell to the Muscovites in July 1514.

Russia subsequently suffered a series of disastrous defeats in the field. In 1512, Grand Hetman of Lithuania, Konstanty Ostrogski, ransacked the region of Severia and vanquished a Russian force of approximately 6,000 men. On 8 September 1514, Muscovy suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Orsha, which prevented the Russians to place all the former Kievan Rus&#x27; lands under their lordship. Poland exploited the battle for propaganda purposes with strong anti-Russian sentiment. A letter sent to Rome stated that &quot;Muscovites are not Christians; they are cruel and barbaric; they are Asians and not Europeans; they are in league with Turks and the Tatars to destroy Christendom&quot;.
Regardless of victory, the Polish–Lithuanian troops were incapable of moving quickly enough to retake Smolensk. In 1518, Russian forces were again beaten during the siege of Polotsk, when according to legend the Lithuanian forces were inspired by the sight of their patron saint, Saint Casimir, the older brother of Sigismund. However, this was dubbed by historians as a folk tale. In 1522, a truce was signed between Lithuania and Muscovy which extended until 1534.

In 1534, when Grand Hetman Jerzy Radziwiłł and the Tatars pillaged western Russia, the Muscovites in retaliation invaded Lithuania once more. They were eventually stopped by Polish commander Jan Amor Tarnowski and allies at Starodub in 1535. Their defeat strengthened the Polish-Lithuanian union&#x27;s eastern flank until the beginning of the Livonian War in 1558.

===Europe===

In 1515 Sigismund entered into an alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. In return for Maximilian lending weight to the provisions of the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), Sigismund consented to the marriage of the children of Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary, his brother, to the grandchildren of Maximilian. Through this double marriage contract, Bohemia and Hungary passed to the House of Habsburg in 1526, on the death of Sigismund&#x27;s nephew, Louis II, who led his forces against Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire in the disastrous Battle of Mohács.

Worried about the growing ties between the Habsburgs and Russia, in 1524 Sigismund signed a Franco-Polish alliance with King Francis I of France to avoid a possible war on two fronts. Francis I himself was looking for allies in Central Europe to curtail the increasing power of Habsburg Emperor Charles V, whose realms were labelled &quot;the empire on which the sun never sets&quot;. Furthermore, Queen Bona was instrumental in establishing an alliance between Poland and France, with the objective of recovering Milan. The official negotiations were conducted by Antonio Rincon in 1524, who was then followed by Jerome Laski. Through the agreement, the son of Francis, Henry, Duke of Orléans, was to marry one of Sigismund&#x27;s daughters, and Sigismund&#x27;s eldest son was to marry a daughter of Francis I.

The negotiations came to an end and the alliance was disbanded when Francis&#x27; troops were defeated by Charles V at the Battle of Pavia in 1525. Disturbed by the failure of his campaign, Francis turned to Hungary instead and formed a Franco-Hungarian alliance with King John Zápolya in 1528.

After the death of Janusz III of Masovia in 1526, Sigismund succeeded in uniting the Duchy of Masovia and Warsaw with the Kingdom of Poland. There was speculation whether Janusz and his younger brother Stanisław were poisoned by a subject of Queen Bona. The accusations were so pervasive and rampant that Sigismund ordered an investigation, as a result of which a special edict was declared on 9 February 1528 confirming that the Masovian princes died naturally or due to related illness. According to chronicler Jan Długosz, the real cause of the death of both princes could have been inherited tuberculosis.

In other matters of policy, Sigismund sought peaceful coexistence with the Khanate of Crimea, but was unable to completely end border skirmishes.

===Teutonic Knights===
Over two centuries of wars against the Teutonic Knights ended in 1525 with the Treaty of Kraków after the final Polish–Teutonic War (1519–1521). Previously, the Second Peace of Thorn (1466) placed the Teutonic Order under Polish suzerainty and interfered with German interests in Livonia, Pomerania, Warmia and Masuria. The Order attempted to avoid paying tribute to Polish monarchs which was a demonstration of weakness and dependence.

In accordance with the new Treaty of Kraków, the Order was abruptly secularized and turned de facto into a puppet state of Poland which lasted until the Treaty of Bromberg in 1655. Sigismund&#x27;s nephew Albert, Duke of Prussia, converted to Lutheranism under the persuasion of Martin Luther, and paid a feudal homage to Sigismund. In return he was granted the domains of the Order as the First Duke of Prussia. This became known in Polish and Lithuanian history as the &quot;Prussian Homage&quot;, which was often featured in arts. The Prussian Landtag and parliament assembled in Königsberg, where envoys embraced both the new Duke and the Protestant Reformation. Thereupon, the Teutonic Order lost its importance as a military order in Prussia and retreated to the Holy Roman Empire where it became secluded.

==Renaissance and legacy==
Sigismund had a profound interest in Renaissance humanism and the revival of classical antiquity. His second consort Bona Sforza, daughter of Gian Galeazzo Sforza of Milan, was also instrumental in developing the Polish Renaissance and brought renowned Italian artists, architects and sculptors from her native country. It was under Sigismund&#x27;s reign that Renaissance began to flourish in Poland and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Sigismund II Augustus later continued his father&#x27;s legacy.

Among the illustrious figures that guested or lived in Poland at the time were Bartholommeo Berecci, Francesco Fiorentino, Santi and Mateo Gucci, Bernardo Morando, Giovanni Battista di Quadro and Hans Dürer. Most of the decorators working for the court were foreigners, especially Italians and Germans who had a profound impact on Poland&#x27;s architecture as a whole. The centrepiece of their work is Wawel Castle in Kraków, the seat of Polish monarchs as well as one of the largest castles in Central Europe. Situated on a hill overlooking Old Town, the fortified residence was extensively reconstructed in the Renaissance style and to the personal needs of the royal family. The Italian cloistered courtyard in the shape of a quadrangle, corridors, archways and portals were designed by Fiorentino with the help of Benedykt from Sandomierz. A similar design was undertaken in Niepołomice Castle, the hunting retreat of the Jagiellons.

The most prominent example of Sigismund&#x27;s architectural legacy is a funerary monument in the form of a chapel at Wawel Cathedral. It was constructed between 1519 and 1533 according to plans by Bartolomeo Berrecci of Florence, and serves as a mausoleum of the last Jagiellons. The exterior dome is gold-plated and interior tombs made of marble were designed by Santi Gucci. Historians, experts and architects unanimously voted the chapel as &quot;the most beautiful example of the Tuscan Renaissance north of the Alps&quot;. The monarch also commissioned a 12.6-tonne bell which was named in his honour. The Royal Sigismund Bell was installed 13 July 1521 on Wawel Cathedral&#x27;s northernmost tower. Apart from religious and national holidays, the bell rung on some of the most significant moments in Polish history and is one of Poland&#x27;s national symbols.

==Death and succession==

Sigismund suffered from numerous illnesses and diseases, especially towards the end of his life. Most notably, he was tormented by constant fevers since youth as well as gout and acute rheumatism in the autumn of 1528. The condition, which severely affected his joints and right leg, was repetitive and continued in 1529 and 1534. It is likely that Sigismund Augustus was co-crowned &quot;vivente rege&quot; in 1529 as a result of these pervasive pains and in case his father died unexpectedly. Furthermore, bad eating habits and a poor diet contributed to the king&#x27;s ailing health, in particular large amounts of beer and mead. Eventually, the king&#x27;s inability to walk forced him to be carried in a litter. However, despite his age, Sigismund was of sound mind throughout and remained active in politics until death. In 1543, he recovered from an influenza which spread in Kraków and in 1545 he enjoyed a last hunting excursion to Niepołomice.

Sigismund died on 1 April 1548, Easter day at the age of 81 and was buried on 7 July at Wawel Cathedral in Kraków. He was succeeded by his only legitimate son, Sigismund II Augustus, who became the last Jagiellon king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. In 1587 Sigismund the Old&#x27;s grandson, Sigismund III from the House of Vasa, was elected King of Poland. He was the son of Catherine Jagiellon and her husband John III Vasa of Sweden. Hence, Sigismund III could not belong to the Jagiellonian dynasty by his mother, but the Jagiellon bloodline of Polish monarchs continued until the death of Sigismund Vasa&#x27;s second son John II Casimir.

<doc id="42584" wikidata="Q54053" url="?curid=42584" title="Władysław III of Poland">
<text>Władysław III of Poland (31 October 1424 – 10 November 1444), also known as Ladislaus of Varna, was King of Poland and Supreme Duke of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from 1434 as well as King of Hungary and Croatia from 1440 until his death at the Battle of Varna. He was the eldest son of Władysław II Jagiełło (Jogaila) and the Lithuanian noblewoman Sophia of Halshany.

Władysław&#x27;s succeeded his father shortly before turning ten in 1434 and was, therefore, deemed unfit to rule until coming of age. Cardinal Zbigniew Oleśnicki acted as regent and a temporary &quot;provisores&quot; council executed power in the king&#x27;s name. However, Władysław&#x27;s legitimacy to the crown was contested by Lesser Polish nobles favouring the candidacy of Siemowit V of Masovia, who was of Piast lineage. In the aftermath of the coronation, Spytko III of Melsztyn accused Oleśnicki, the council and the Catholic Church of exploiting the king&#x27;s youth to hold authority. A sympathiser with the Czech Hussites, Spytko was killed at the Battle of Grotniki in 1439, thus ending the hostilities.

Władysław simultaneously faced the effects of the Polish–Teutonic War, which commenced under his father&#x27;s reign in 1431. The Teutonic Knights began supporting Švitrigaila and the Livonian Order in a military struggle against Poland and Sigismund Kęstutaitis of Lithuania in 1434, shortly after Władysław assumed the throne. Consequently, the king and the Polish Royal Council, the &quot;curia regis&quot;, renewed their war efforts by fortifying the borderland regions and sending an army to Lithuania, which was engulfed in a civil war since 1432. Švitrigaila, the Livonians and their allies were ultimately defeated at the Battle of Wiłkomierz, and Władysław forced the Peace of Brześć Kujawski on the Teutonic State in December 1435, which curtailed Teutonic influence in East-Central Europe.

The policy of the Kingdom of Poland under Władysław and Oleśnicki was to reclaim lost territories such as Silesia or Pomerania and expand its influence to neighbouring realms. In 1440, Władysław was elected King of Hungary and Croatia following the death of Albert II of Germany. Albert&#x27;s widow, Elizabeth of Luxembourg, spurned the outcome and advocated for her infant son, Ladislaus the Posthumous, to rule under the guardianship of Frederick III Habsburg whilst purloining the Holy Crown of Hungary. Prolonged hostilities from the Habsburgs, the imminent Ottoman advance into Hungary and Elizabeth&#x27;s sudden death solidified Władysław&#x27;s legitimacy to the Hungarian throne. Ruling much of Southeastern and Central Europe, Władysław became compelled in confronting the Ottoman Empire.

With the Turkish grip over the Balkans weakened in the aftermath of the Hungarian–Ottoman War (1437–1442), the papacy and papal legate Julian Cesarini urged Władysław to launch the Crusade of Varna. After initial successes, the outnumbered Christian forces engaged in a decisive battle at Varna, where Władysław was killed in a heroic cavalry charge against Sultan Murad II. His body was never recovered and its disappearance led to numerous survival theories or legends, none of which have been confirmed. Władysław&#x27;s legacy in Poland and Hungary is divisive, yet Władysław remains a notable figure in countries like Bulgaria, which were under Ottoman domination. He was succeeded in Poland by his younger brother Casimir IV, and in Hungary-Croatia by his rival Ladislaus V the Posthumous.

==Early life, 1424–1434==
===Childhood, 1424–1431===

Władysław was born in Kraków on 31 October 1424, the first-born son of Władysław II Jagiełło (his pagan name was Jogaila) and Sophia of Halshany, both of whom were Lithuanian in origin. His father was already an elderly man, having outlived three of his consorts, and the birth of a male successor was widely regarded as a miracle. He was baptised at Wawel Cathedral in mid-February 1425 by Wojciech Jastrzębiec, Bishop of Gniezno and Primate of Poland. It took place in the presence of Andrzej Łaskarz Laskary, Bishop of Poznań and Zbigniew Oleśnicki, Bishop of Kraków as well as statesmen and royal emissaries from the surrounding realms. The ceremony was unequivocally grandiose; the most probable day of the baptism is 18 February, though this continues to be contested by historians and various sources.

In 1427, the Polish nobility initiated anti-Jagiellonian opposition and attempted to have Jogaila&#x27;s sons declared illegitimate to the Polish throne as they possessed no blood relation to their Piast and Anjou predecessors. In the same year, Queen Sophia was accused of adultery, which aggravated the conflict. Despite the agreements signed between Jogaila and the magnates to ensure the succession for his sons, the opposing faction opted for Frederick II of Brandenburg, who was betrothed to Hedwig Jagiellon, Jogaila&#x27;s daughter by his second wife. However, the conspiracy was resolved by the death of the princess in December 1431, rumoured to have been poisoned by Sophia.

===Opposition and Cardinal Oleśnicki, 1432–1434===
From a young age, Władysław was surrounded by advisors loyal to Zbigniew Oleśnicki (known in Latin as Sbigneus), a cardinal who acted as royal guardian and aimed at maintaining his influence and high position at court. Oleśnicki learned of Jogaila&#x27;s death on 1 June 1434 in Poznań, whilst he was en route to the Council of Basel, but decided to remain in Poland and usurp the role of interrex. He subsequently convened an assembly in Poznań with the assistance of Chancellor Jan Taszka Koniecpolski, and called for the nobles of Greater Poland to warrant Władysław&#x27;s right to the crown. This arbitrary behaviour displayed by the assembly vexed the nobility of Lesser Poland, who were outmanoeuvred and excluded from the vote.

There was growing antagonism in the demesne and the challengers feared that crowning a young and inexperienced king would invest Oleśnicki with too much power over the affairs of state. Others repudiated a son of formerly-pagan Jogaila on the Polish throne and yearned for a living descendant of the Piast dynasty. The candidacy of Siemowit V remained a considerable threat to Władysław, especially that Siemowit was of royal Piast lineage and a member of a branch that ruled the Duchy of Masovia since the Testament of Bolesław III Wrymouth in the 12th century.

Many opponents also attempted to counter the power of the Catholic clergy, notably under the influence of Hussitism from neighbouring Bohemia. Among the chief adversaries were , the judge royal of Poznań and a fierce propagator of the Hussites&#x27; proto-Protestant movement, , and Spytko III of Melsztyn, a supporter of pro-Hussite military expeditions led by Sigismund Korybut to Bohemia in the years 1422–1427. They received clandestine sponsorship from influential magnates and nobles from Lesser Poland, who persuaded Oleśnicki to delay the coronation until 25 July 1434. This granted the opposition additional time to establish an independent assembly on 13 July in Opatów, where forthcoming actions were to be discussed. Oleśnicki, having discovered their intent, arrived to the proceedings unannounced and successfully questioned its purpose, and the council hastily dissolved. Negotiations were held in Kraków prior to 25 July with the dignitaries sent by Sigismund Kęstutaitis and Spytko, who attempted to obstruct Władysław&#x27;s accession. , Crown Marshal of Poland and the brother of Zbigniew Oleśnicki, called for a decisive vote, which ended the dispute.

==Reign, 1434–1444==
===Coronation, 1434===
Władysław was crowned at Wawel Cathedral on 25 July 1434 by the elderly Wojciech Jastrzębiec. There is evidence that the coronation was closely supervised by Oleśnicki, who was instrumental in determining how the investiture is conducted. Changes were made to the order of formalities under Oleśnicki&#x27;s &quot;Ordo ad cornandum ad regem Poloniae&quot;, notably the young monarch was obliged to take an oath before the anointment and the handing over of Polish royal insignia. This act was to be seen as submission to the privileges of nobles; the king-elect&#x27;s fulfillment of the elites&#x27; requirements, not hereditary rights, was a condition for obtaining the throne in the Kingdom of Poland. Furthermore, the crown jewels were given to the officials, rather than being placed at the altar, implying Władysław&#x27;s minority and the officials&#x27; active participation in the coronation. The act in which Władysław undertook &quot;signum crucis&quot; with a sword in the direction of the four corners of the world was abandoned.

The chronicler Jan Długosz (Latin: Johannes Longinus) writes that the boy king, dressed in royal garments and accompanied by bishops Oleśnicki and , Bishop of Płock, rode from Wawel Castle to greet the townsfolk. However, a customary feudal homage by the burghers at Kraków Town Hall came into effect because of a disagreement between the bishops and Masovia princes concerning the order of precedence in the royal procession and on sitting arrangements.

===Regency, 1434–1438===
Shortly after the coronation, senior nobles held both covert and open conventions to discuss the possibility of instituting a regency as the king was still a minor and could not govern. Duke Siemowit, who was staying in the capital of Kraków at the time, remained a valid contender for the role of regent or caretaker because of his personal qualities and rank, however, the idea was soon dismissed. Many of the noble lords believed that Siemowit could seize the crown for himself, rather than remain an inferior subject to the boy. Queen Sophia&#x27;s attempts to be named regent, in accordance with her late husband&#x27;s instructions, also failed and the general indecisiveness caused the apex of oligarch influence in medieval Poland. As compromise, a regency council was formed comprising regional governors called the &quot;provisores&quot;. Długosz noted three members, each selected for merit and &quot;wisdom&quot;, which was possibly aimed at curtailing Zbigniew Oleśnicki&#x27;s influence. Nonetheless, Oleśnicki retained considerable control over Władysław&#x27;s upbringing.

It is believed that Władysław did not have a decisive voice in politics and the situation did not change even after the Sejm, the Polish Parliament, had gathered in Piotrków in 1438 and declared the 14-year-old king to have attained his majority.

===Civil war in Lithuania, 1434–1438===

Władysław faced certain challenges early in his reign, in particular the inherited situation in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was precarious and the ensuing Lithuanian Civil War (1432–1438) threatened Polish interests there. The conflict began when Władysław&#x27;s paternal uncle, Švitrigaila, refused to acknowledge fealty to his brother Jogaila and proclaimed political independence, jeopardising the Polish–Lithuanian union. He subsequently battled against Polish–Lithuanian forces in Volhynia and established an anti-Polish coalition. In June 1431, he reached an agreement with the Teutonic State, which declared a surprise war and marched its army into Polish territory. Following a truce with the Teutonic Knights, the war resumed when Władysław became king. The situation swiftly transformed into a diplomatic struggle for Władysław and the Poles, who sought to turn Lithuanian nobles against Švitrigaila and have him ousted.

A Polish retinue of approximately 4,000 men under Jakub Kobylański assisted the Lithuanians headed by Sigismund Kęstutaitis and Michael Žygimantaitis; their joint army defeated Švitrigaila and his allies, Sigismund Korybut and the Livonian Order, on 1 September 1435 at the Battle of Wiłkomierz. Švitrigaila fled eastward, but eventually lost the support of the Ruthenians residing in the Grand Duchy and went into exile to Moldavia in 1438, thus ending civil war. However, unrest re-emerged when Sigismund Kęstutaitis was assassinated on 20 March 1440 and Władysław&#x27;s younger brother, Casimir, was proclaimed Grand Duke by Jonas Goštautas and the Lithuanian Council of Lords on 29 June 1440. This was met with hostility at the Polish court, especially that Casimir was underage and that the Poles hoped for a vicegerent that would submit to Poland. Regardless of the outcome, Władysław continued to use the title of Supreme Duke of Lithuania until death under the conditions of the 1413 Union of Horodło.

The battle also proved momentous in combating the Livonian Order as its Grand Master, Franco Kerskorff, and &quot;komtur&quot; commanders were killed or taken prisoner. The Livonian Confederation agreement from 4 December 1435 officially terminated its crusading character, and a formal peace treaty was signed on 31 December 1435 in Brześć Kujawski whereby the Teutonic and Livonian Orders pledged not to intrude or disturb the internal affairs of both Poland and Lithuania. That act concluded the Polish–Teutonic War (1431–1435). Moreover, any association between the knights and the Pope or the Holy Roman Emperor would violate the treaty. His youth prvented Władysław from engaging directly in the peace talks, and the negotiations were predominantly undertaken by diplomats or the clergy.

===Domestic and foreign policy, 1438–1440===

The successive years were marked by the extirpation of Polish Hussites under the Edict of Wieluń, signed earlier in 1424. The initial hostilities eventually culminated in a minor rebellion during Władysław&#x27;s reign. On 3 May 1439, Spytko of Melsztyn formed a small but armed ad hoc confederation in the town of Nowy Korczyn against Oleśnicki&#x27;s desire to exterminate the Hussites and to challenge his authority over the young king. Consequently, Spytko was accused of high treason and maleficence. The cardinal sent crown troops to pacify the movement and execute the death warrant. Spytko was ultimately killed at the Battle of Grotniki. His corpse pierced with arrows laid bare in the field for three days, however, Władysław personally ordered Spytko&#x27;s body to be returned to his widow and restored the family&#x27;s noble status and privileges.

The court also devised the return of lost territories, most notably the southern Duchies of Silesia, which continued to be ruled by the Silesian Piasts. In the north, the gentry of Greater Poland and Kuyavia demanded the recovery of Pomerania. Speaking on behalf of Władysław, the cardinal was opposed to the idea of reclaiming Pomerania and believed that peace between Poland and the Teutonic Order was critical, as the Teutonic Knights were no longer a tool of the Holy Roman Emperor and were wary of taking up arms. He also dedicated himself to subtler diplomatic measures when addressing the issue of Silesia, a large historical region within the Bohemian Crown, but was unwilling to support the Hussites militarily against Sigismund of Luxembourg and his son-in-law, Albert II of Germany. The priority was diverted towards stabilising domestic affairs as well as maintaining Poland&#x27;s status as a great power and a pillar of the Catholic Church in East-Central Europe.

The union with Lithuania remained impregnable, and a dynastic union with the Kingdom of Hungary was to be formed, as Sigismund had no male heirs. The Polish Sejm and statesmen hoped that by marrying Władysław to one of Sigismund&#x27;s granddaughters, Poland could secure his accession in Hungary and foist Jagiellonian rule there. That would restore a union of Hungary and Poland, which had not been seen since the reign of Louis I of Anjou (1370–1382). The union would also allow Poland to renegotiate disputed territories between the Poles and the Hungarians, including Halych (later constituting Galicia) and Moldavia. In response, Poland would propose a military alliance and vow the expulsion of the Ottoman Turks from Hungarian lands.

===King of Hungary and Croatia, 1440===
In October 1439, Albert II died and left the Austrian, Bohemian and Hungarian thrones unoccupied. His only son, born in February 1440, became known as Ladislaus the Posthumous. Ladislaus&#x27; claim to the Duchy of Austria was acknowledged in accordance with Albert&#x27;s testament. Under the influence and pressure of Oldřich II of Rosenberg, the Catholic nobles were also inclined to endorse Ladislaus&#x27;s hereditary right to Bohemia. Conversely, the Hungarians were not willing to pass his candidacy and began dialogue with the Poles. In early January 1440, the Hungarian Estates rejected the deceased king&#x27;s testament at an assembly in Buda that would place the regency in the hands of Frederick III Habsburg.

The general animosity towards the Habsburg dynasty and the impending Ottoman threat prevented the Hungarians from accepting an infant as king and turned to Poland. Ladislaus&#x27; widowed mother, Queen Elizabeth of Luxembourg, was desperate to halt that and sent intermediaries to persuade the Hungarians to terminate all negotiations with Władysław. Contrary to her efforts, the Hungarian nobles proved resolute and elected Władysław king on 8 March 1440. Prior to his election, Władysław vowed to marry Elizabeth and protect her infant son&#x27;s interests in Austria and Bohemia. Simultaneously, Władysław was made King of Croatia as the Croatian dominion was in a personal union with Hungary since 1102.

Elizabeth did not approve of the Estates&#x27; election, and on 15 May 1440, she had her son crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary, which one of Elizabeth&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting (Helene Kottanner) had stolen from safekeeping at the fortress of Visegrád. The Hungarians soon decried the ceremony as an unlawful farce and utilised a reliquary crown for Władysław&#x27;s coronation on 17 July 1440 at the Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Székesfehérvár. He had also received significant support from Pope Eugene IV, in exchange for his help in organising an anti-Muslim crusade. Although still young and king solely by title, Władysław became deeply involved in the struggle against the Ottomans, having been brought up in the standard of a pious Christian monarch.

===Discord and unrest, 1440–1442===

Shortly after Władysław&#x27;s accession the conflict with the supporters of Elizabeth deepened. The western and northern parts of the country remained on the side of the queen and opposing magnates, chiefly the Counts of Celje (Cilli), the Garai family and Dénes Szécsi, Archbishop of Esztergom. In turn, the eastern regions and Transylvania upheld Władysław and his partisans, among them John Hunyadi who became a leading political and military figure in Hungary.

In order to assert her claim, Elizabeth had to maintain the wealthy mining counties in what now constitutes Slovakia and hired Hussite mercenaries from Bohemia commanded by John Jiskra. Jiskra undertook a quick campaign and occupied much of the fortresses and defensive posts in northern Hungary, often with the support of local populations and devotees that held Jiskra in high regard because of his fight for religious freedoms. As a benefactor to the mercenaries, Elizabeth had to pawn the Holy Crown and transfer tutelage over her newborn son to Frederick III. However, this proved insufficient to fund the war against Władysław; she was then forced to handover her privately owned Austrian estates and the Hungarian County of Sopron to the Habsburgs in late 1440 and early 1441. This conduct alienated many of the lords that initially supported Elizabeth&#x27;s cause, including Nicholas of Ilok, Ban of Croatia, who switched sides and allied himself with Władysław and John Hunyadi.

The western territories as well as some 70 fortresses under Ulrich II, Count of Celje in modern-day Austria, Croatia and Slovenia remained stalwart and loyal to the queen. Before the end of 1440, Hunyadi attacked Győr but was unable to take the garrisoned city. He was, however, successful in capturing local townships and villages around Buda and Székesfehérvár to prevent the escape of nobles and designated traitors. This proved paramount when Ulrich II made an attempt to flee to Bratislava (Pozsony); he was caught by a Polish detachment and subsequently imprisoned at Władysław&#x27;s behest. Concurrently, Ladislaus Garai instigated a rebellion in the south. Hunyadi, together with Nicholas of Ilok, annihilated Garai&#x27;s army at Bátaszék on 10 September 1440. In January 1441, Ulrich was released from captivity, pledged an oath of loyalty to Władysław and freed the hostages held by his troops.

Elizabeth prolonged her resistance until December 1442, when a peace treaty was signed at Győr under the auspices of Cardinal Julian Cesarini. Elizabeth died not long after meeting Władysław and exchanging gifts; her supporters claimed that she was poisoned on his orders to prevent their marriage. Cesarini had the treaty ratified by Frederick under the pressure of Pope Eugene, though Frederick abstained from doing so until May 1444. The internal unrest caused Hungary to become vulnerable militarily and was severely weakened for the Turkish campaign.

===Crusade against the Muslim Ottomans, 1443–1444===

The prelude to the crusade began when the Turks were defeated in the Hungarian–Ottoman War of 1437–1442 and temporarily lost jurisdiction over the Principality of Wallachia. In 1442, Sultan Murad II sent Mezid Bey into Transylvania with a large akinji army, raiding cities, towns and villages from the border to Sibiu (known in German as Hermannstadt and in Hungarian as Nagyszeben). Hunyadi initially lost the skirmish and one of the Hungarian leaders, Bishop György Lépes, was killed at Sântimbru, Alba. However, a few days later Hunyadi regrouped and attacked Ottoman positions with heavy cavalry at the Battle of Hermannstadt, capturing and beheading Mezid. This empowered Hungary to coerce the Wallachians and Moldavians to change loyalty and turn into the vassals of Hungary. Murad sought revenge and entrusted Hadım Şehabeddin, governor-general of Rumelia, with a new force to enter Wallachia; he too was defeated by Hunyadi near the Ialomița River.

Throughout the autumn of 1442, Cesarini and the Republic of Venice were planning a crusade against the Turks, with the papacy pledging patronage and considerable funding. The united force would set out from Hungary with an assembled fleet under Francesco Condulmer stationed at the Dardanelles Strait. The objective was to isolate routes and communication from Anatolia to Europe, protect Constantinople, and join with the land troops to capture Turkish defensive posts on the River Danube, thus leaving the Ottoman main army caught in Anatolia. Cesarini, acting as papal legate and gathering support, disseminated slogans and propaganda that would incite the Christian army to act. Moreover, Italian humanist Francesco Filelfo wrote a personal letter to Władysław, describing him in Latin as the &quot;propugnaculum&quot;, or the &quot;bulwark of Christianity&quot;. On the other hand, Vlad II Dracul tried to dissuade Władysław from waging war against the Ottomans. Nevertheless, Vlad Dracul provided 7,000 (according to some accounts 4,000) horsemen under the command of his son, Mircea, to fight against the Ottomans.

On 15 April 1444, at the diet in Buda and in the presence of Cardinal Cesarini, Władysław swore to renew the war against Turkish infidels in the coming summer. Similar promises were made to the Venetian delegates, the Signoria of Florence and to the Kingdom of Bosnia. Philip the Good of Burgundy was also a generous benefactor to the Christian cause. Simultaneously, Władysław engaged Stojka Gisdanić and dispatched him to Edirne as an envoy and mediator in peace talks with the Ottomans. In June 1444, the fleet of Francesco Condulmer and Alvise Loredan was ready to sail and by mid-July arrived at Methoni, Messenia, in modern-day Greece. Murad already crossed into Asia Minor by this time and the fleet was tasked with preventing re-entry by holding the strait against him.

In August, a Polish assembly at Piotrków implored him to make peace with the Ottomans, dissatisfied with the level of taxes raised for the war and believing that Murad&#x27;s terms could be lucrative. The Poles were convinced that this would encourage Władysław to leave the Balkans, return to Poland and re-establish himself there as king. Meanwhile, Cesarini sent letters of progress to Cyriacus of Ancona, who was staying in Constantinople; he then translated them from Latin into Greek for John VIII Palaiologos, Byzantine emperor. The Byzantines were ecstatic of the news brought by Cesarini, as were the Genoese colonies and Pera (Galata). Cyriacus also distributed letters to Neapolitan nobility and to Alfonso V of Aragon, urging them to join the campaign. The victory of Jean de Lastic and his Knights Hospitaller in the Siege of Rhodes contributed to the general euphoria surrounding the crusade.

In mid-August 1444, the Peace of Szeged was ratified in Oradea (Várad). However, Władysław abjured his oath and the war continued; on 20 September 1444 the king and Hunyadi crossed the Danube, beginning the army&#x27;s march to the shores of the Black Sea to make contact with the allied fleet. The Pope annulled and released Gjergj Arianiti from peace he made with the Turks; Arianiti was then able to march with his troops to Macedonia and fight alongside the Christians if required. At this time, Murad concluded a favourable peace treaty with Ibrahim II of Karaman, who threatened Anatolia from the south. It allowed the Turks to focus their attention and resources on advancing into Europe; in late October 1444 he crossed the Bosphorus while the Christian fleet was stalled from adverse winds, and the Venetians did not make an effort to prevent that. Scholar Poggio Bracciolini appraised that as the true cause of the crusade&#x27;s early failure. Genoese merchants and sailors were also accused of corruption and accepting bribes from Murad. According to witnesses, the Ottoman troops outnumbered the combined Christian forces and quickly marched to the Black Sea without a delay.

===Death at Varna and succession, 1444===

The Venetian treachery placed the large Ottoman army of around 60,000 men in proximity to the unsuspecting 16,000 crusaders, almost outnumbering the Christians by three to one. The crusader fleet, largely manned by Venetian mercenaries and sailors, did not engage in direct combat and desisted from sailing into the Black Sea. Thereafter, the battle began on 10 November 1444 at Varna, Bulgaria; the crusaders were initially successful in defending against Ottoman assaults and Murad sustained heavy losses. Acts of heroism were abundant on the Christian side, almost making up for the lack of men; as was the courage displayed on the battlefield by John Hunyadi. Murad was wary of the battle at first and contemplated escaping when the crusaders took the left flank, but the Janissaries restrained him.

Hunyadi is purported to have proposed that the Christian left assists the right flank to move the Turks out of position, and stated that &quot;the son of Osman&#x27;s army shall be defeated&quot;. The Ottoman troops under Hadım Şehabeddin of Rumelia began to break and some fled the battle, though the Turkish resistance was fierce. One of the crusaders, Andreas de Pallatio, later wrote in his memoirs that Władysław seized the initiative on the Christian right flank and tore into Şehabeddin&#x27;s ranks like &quot;a new Caesar&quot;, pushing the Rumelians up the valley&#x27;s slope. Many of the novice yet still elite Janissaries and azebs were driven back. Pallatio also notes that the size of Murad&#x27;s army was too great to counter and it seemed as if the Christian offensive barely inflicted any major casualties. Władysław&#x27;s men quickly became exhausted, with many wounded by arrows and battered, including Hunyadi. In spite of this, the majority of the Ottoman army either fled or was dead. Consequently, Murad decided to seek refuge in his fortified encampment in the rear.

Facing desperate circumstances and seeing Hunyadi&#x27;s struggle against the Rumelian sipahis, Władysław decided to take a chance by directly charging the sultan&#x27;s camp and his armed retinue with heavy cavalry. Few men were able to see the charge and no one returned from the assault, which alarmed the crusaders. The young king was most certainly killed when his charge lost impetus and came to a standstill amongst the unyielding Janissaries protecting the sultan. It is possible that the king&#x27;s horse fell into a trap; Pope Pius II writes that Władysław might have been dismounted from his horse by the Turks. The Janissaries then killed the king&#x27;s bodyguard, beheaded Władysław and displayed his head on a lance, spear or pole. Records mention a severed male head candied in a bowl of honey by the Turks, but the head contained blonde hair, and Władysław was a brunette. Disheartened by the death of the king, the Hungarian Army fled the battlefield, and the remainder surrendered. On his return, Hunyadi tried frantically to salvage the king&#x27;s body; neither Władysław&#x27;s body nor his armour were ever found.

Władysław was succeeded in Poland by his younger brother, Duke Casimir IV of Lithuania, in 1447, after a three-year interregnum. In Hungary, he was succeeded by his former rival, the child-king Ladislaus the Posthumous.

==Appearance and personal life==
According to 19th-century sources based on medieval chronicles, Władysław was of medium height, with a swarthy (olive) complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, and possessed a graceful gaze. There are no other accounts disclosing his physical appearance. He did not indulge in overeating or excessive drinking, and was a person of extreme patience and piety. Furthermore, the king was known to be of strong character and merciful to his foes, when required.

Władysław had no children and did not marry. Contemporary sources suggest that he was homosexual. The chronicler Jan Długosz, known for his antipathy towards the Jagiellons, alleged that there was something unusual about the monarch&#x27;s sexuality. Długosz did not specify the details behind that but stated &quot;too subject to his carnal desires&quot; and &quot;he did not abandon his lewd and despicable habits&quot;. On the other hand, Długosz noted later, &quot;No age has ever seen and will never see a more Catholic and holy ruler who, according to his highest goodness, has never harmed any Christian. [...] Finally, like a holy king and a second angel on Earth, he lived an unmarried and virgin life at home and during the war&quot;.

==Legacy==
Władysław&#x27;s legacy as King of Hungary was tarnished in existing records by the Habsburgs; the largely unrealistic picture of his reign presented in the &quot;Annales&quot; chronicles were constructed as a consistent polemic comprising the allegations of what is described as &quot;Habsburg propaganda&quot;. Furthermore, Władysław&#x27;s claim to Hungary was deemed illegitimate and he was often portrayed as a usurper, who unsuccessfully launched a crusade against the Turks. Rumours also spread that Władysław had Elizabeth of Luxembourg poisoned as her death occurred suddenly after their meeting in December 1442.

Following his death, Władysław III was commemorated in many songs and poems.

A main boulevard and residential district in Varna are named after Władysław. In 1935 a park-museum, Władysław Warneńczyk, opened in Varna, with a symbolic cenotaph built atop of an ancient Thracian mound tomb. There had been also a football team named after Vladislav in Varna, present day its inheritor is known as PFC Cherno More Varna.

===Legend of survival===
According to a Portuguese legend Władysław survived the battle and then journeyed in secrecy to the Holy Land. He became a knight of Saint Catharine of Mount Sinai (&quot;O Cavaleiro de Santa Catarina&quot;) and then settled on Madeira. King Afonso V of Portugal granted him lands in the Madalena do Mar district of the Madeira Islands for life. He was known there as &quot;Henrique Alemão&quot; (Henry the German) and married Senhorinha Anes, with the King of Portugal acting as his best man. The marriage produced two sons. He established a church of Saint Catherine and Mary Magdalene at Madalena do Mar in 1471. There he was depicted in a painting as Saint Joachim meeting Saint Anne at the Golden Gate on a painting by Master of the Adoration of Machico (Mestre &quot;da Adoração de Machico&quot;) in the beginning of the 16th century.

According to the tradition, he felt his defeat at Varna was a warning sign from God (since he declared war on a false pretext, violating the truce with the Ottoman Muslims). Thus, he wandered as a pilgrim, seeking forgiveness, which he found in Jerusalem. For the rest of his life he would deny his identity. A delegation of Polish monks went to Madeira to question him and certified he was in fact the long lost king, now living in secrecy. He declined their suggestion to ascend the Polish throne again.

According to another controversial version of the legend, promoted by Manuel da Silva Rosa, Władysław (as &quot;Henrique Alemão&quot;) was the biological father of Christopher Columbus.

<doc id="42586" wikidata="Q54049" url="?curid=42586" title="Władysław II Jagiełło">
<text>Jogaila (; 1 June 1434), later Władysław II Jagiełło (), was Grand Duke of Lithuania beginning in 1377 and starting in 1386, becoming King of Poland as well. As Grand Duke, he ruled Lithuania from 1377 to 1381 and from 1382 to 1401, at which time he became the Supreme Duke of Lithuania in exchange for naming his cousin Vytautas as the new Grand Duke. Władysław II initially served as King of Poland alongside his wife Jadwiga until her death in 1399, and then the sole ruler until his own death in 1434.

Raised a Lithuanian polytheist, he converted to Catholicism in 1386 and baptized as Ladislaus () in Kraków, married the young Queen Jadwiga, and was crowned King of Poland as Władysław II Jagiełło. In 1387, he converted Lithuania to Catholicism. His reign in Poland started in 1399, upon the death of Queen Jadwiga, lasted a further thirty-five years, and laid the foundation for the centuries-long Polish–Lithuanian union. He was a member of the Jagiellonian dynasty in Poland that bears his name and was previously also known as the Gediminid dynasty in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The dynasty ruled both states until 1572, and became one of the most influential dynasties in late medieval and early modern Europe.

Jogaila was the last pagan ruler of medieval Lithuania. After he became King of Poland, as a result of the Union of Krewo, the newly formed Polish-Lithuanian union confronted the growing power of the Teutonic Order. The allied victory at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, followed by the Peace of Thorn, secured the Polish and Lithuanian borders and marked the emergence of the Polish–Lithuanian alliance as a significant force in Europe. The reign of Władysław II Jagiełło extended Polish frontiers and is often considered the beginning of Poland&#x27;s Golden Age.

==Early life==

===Lithuania===
Little is known of Jogaila&#x27;s early life, and even his year of birth is uncertain. Previously historians assumed he was born in 1352, but some recent research suggests a later date—about 1362. He was a descendant of the Gediminid dynasty and was the son of Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his second wife, Uliana of Tver, who was the daughter of the Yaroslavichi prince Alexander of Tver. His name had a meaning of more courageous and superior than others, he spent most of his early time in Vilnius, at his father&#x27;s manor.
The Grand Duchy of Lithuania to which Jogaila succeeded as Grand Duke in 1377 was a political entity composed of two leading, but very different nationalities and two political systems: ethnic Lithuania in the north-west and the vast Ruthenian territories of former Kievan Rus&#x27;, comprising the lands of modern Ukraine, Belarus, and parts of western Russia. At first, Jogaila—like his father—based his rule in the southern and eastern territories of Lithuania, while his uncle, Kęstutis, the Duke of Trakai, continued to rule the north-western region. Jogaila&#x27;s succession, however, soon placed this system of dual rule under strain.

At the start of his reign, Jogaila was preoccupied with unrest in the Lithuanian Rus&#x27; lands. In 1377–78, Andrei of Polotsk, the eldest son of Algirdas, challenged Jogaila&#x27;s authority and sought to become Grand Duke. In 1380, Andrei and another brother, Dmitry, sided with Prince Dmitri of Moscow against Jogaila&#x27;s alliance with emir Mamai, de facto khan of the Golden Horde. Jogaila failed to support Mamai, lingering in the vicinity of the battlefield, which led to Mamai&#x27;s army&#x27;s significant defeat at the hands of Prince Dmitri in the Battle of Kulikovo. The Muscovites&#x27; Pyrrhic victory over the Golden Horde, in the long term, signified, however, the beginning of a slow climb to power by the Grand Duchy of Moscow, which became within a century the most serious rival and threat to the integrity, well-being and survival of Lithuania. However, in 1380 Muscovy was greatly weakened by tremendous losses suffered during the battle and thus, in the same year, Jogaila was free to begin a struggle for supremacy with Kęstutis.
In the north-west, Lithuania faced constant armed incursions from the Teutonic Knights—founded after 1226 to fight and convert the pagan Baltic tribes of Prussians, Yotvingians and Lithuanians. In 1380, Jogaila concluded the secret Treaty of Dovydiškės, directed against Kęstutis. When Kęstutis discovered the plan, the Lithuanian Civil War began. He seized Vilnius, overthrew Jogaila, and pronounced himself grand duke in his place. In 1382, Jogaila raised an army from his father&#x27;s vassals and confronted Kęstutis near Trakai. Kęstutis and his son Vytautas entered Jogaila&#x27;s encampment for negotiations but were tricked and imprisoned in the Kreva Castle, where Kęstutis was found dead, probably murdered, a week later. Vytautas escaped to the Teutonic fortress of Marienburg and was baptised there under the name Wigand.

Jogaila formulated the Treaty of Dubysa, which rewarded the Knights for their aid in defeating Kęstutis and Vytautas by promising Christianisation and granting them Samogitia west of the Dubysa river. However, when Jogaila failed to ratify the treaty, the Knights invaded Lithuania in the summer of 1383. In 1384, Jogaila reconciled with Vytautas promising to return his patrimony in Trakai. Vytautas then turned against the Knights, attacking and looting several Prussian castles.

It is known that Jogaila, being ethnic Lithuanian by the man&#x27;s line, himself knew and spoke in the Lithuanian language with Vytautas, his cousin from the Gediminids dynasty. Also, during the Christianization of Samogitia, none of the clergy, who came to Samogitia with Jogaila, were able to communicate with the natives, therefore Jogaila himself taught the Samogitians about the Catholicism, thus he was able to communicate in the Samogitian dialect of the Lithuanian language. According to the Teutonic Order&#x27;s testimonial, he could not read nor write, and had to listen to others reading for him.

===Baptism and marriage===

Jogaila&#x27;s Russian mother Uliana of Tver urged him to marry Sofia, daughter of Prince Dmitri of Moscow, who required him first to convert to Orthodoxy. That option, however, was unlikely to halt the crusades against Lithuania by the Teutonic Knights, who regarded Orthodox Christians as schismatics and little better than heathens. Jogaila chose therefore to accept a Polish proposal to become a Catholic and marry the eleven-year-old Queen Jadwiga of Poland. The nobles of Lesser Poland made this offer to Jogaila for many reasons. They wanted to neutralize the dangers posed by Lithuania itself and to secure the fertile territories of Galicia–Volhynia. The Polish nobles saw the offer as an opportunity for increasing their privileges and avoiding Austrian influence, brought by Jadwiga&#x27;s previous fiancé William, Duke of Austria.

On 14 August 1385 in Kreva Castle, Jogaila confirmed his prenuptial promises in the Union of Krewo (Union of Kreva). The promises included the adoption of Christianity, repatriation of lands &quot;stolen&quot; from Poland by its neighbours, and &quot;terras suas Lithuaniae et Russiae Coronae Regni Poloniae perpetuo applicare&quot;, a clause interpreted by historians to mean anything from a personal union between Lithuania and Poland to a complete incorporation of Lithuania into Poland. The agreement at Kreva has been described both as far-sighted and as a desperate gamble.

Jogaila was duly baptized at the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków on 15 February 1386 and from then on formally used the name Władysław or Latin versions of it. The marriage took place three days later, and on 4 March 1386 Jogaila was crowned King Władysław by archbishop Bodzanta. He was also to be legally adopted by Jadwiga&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth of Bosnia, so retaining the throne in the event of Jadwiga&#x27;s death. He was the first Lithuanian to be crowned as the King of Poland. The royal baptism triggered the conversion of most of Jogaila&#x27;s court and noblemen, as well as mass baptisms in Lithuanian rivers, a beginning of the final Christianization of Lithuania. Though the ethnic Lithuanian nobility were the main converts to Catholicism—both paganism and the Orthodox rite remained strong among the peasants—the king&#x27;s conversion and its political implications created lasting repercussions for the history of both Lithuania and Poland. On 22 February 1387, he banned Catholics from marriages with Orthodox and demanded those Orthodox who previously married with the Catholics to convert to Catholicism.

==Ruler of Lithuania and Poland==

===Accession===

Władysław II Jagiello and Jadwiga reigned as co-monarchs; and though Jadwiga probably had little real power, she took an active part in Poland&#x27;s political and cultural life. In 1387, she led two successful military expeditions to Red Ruthenia, recovered lands her father, Louis I of Hungary, had transferred from Poland to Hungary, and secured the homage of Voivode Petru I of Moldavia. In 1390, she also personally opened negotiations with the Teutonic Order. Most political responsibilities, however, fell to Jagiello, with Jadwiga attending to the cultural and charitable activities for which she is still revered.

Soon after Jagiello acceded to the Polish throne, Jagiello granted Vilnius a city charter like that of Kraków, modelled on the Magdeburg Law; and Vytautas issued a privilege to a Jewish commune of Trakai on almost the same terms as privileges issued to the Jews of Poland in the reigns of Boleslaus the Pious and Casimir the Great. Władysław&#x27;s policy of unifying the two legal systems was partial and uneven at first but achieved a lasting influence. By the time of the Union of Lublin in 1569, there was not much difference between the administrative and judicial systems in force in Lithuania and Poland.

One effect of Jagiello&#x27;s measures was to be the advancement of Catholics in Lithuania at the expense of Orthodox elements; in 1387 and 1413, for example, Lithuanian Catholic boyars were granted special judicial and political privileges denied to the Orthodox boyars. As this process gained momentum, it was accompanied by the rise of both Rus&#x27; and Lithuanian identity in the fifteenth century.

===Challenges===

Jagiello&#x27;s baptism failed to end the crusade of the Teutonic Knights, who claimed his conversion was a sham, perhaps even heresy, and renewed their incursions on the pretext that pagans remained in Lithuania. From then on, however, the Order found it harder to sustain the cause of a crusade and faced the growing threat to its existence posed by the Kingdom of Poland and a genuinely Christian Lithuania alliance. Władysław sponsored the creation of the diocese of Vilnius under bishop Andrzej Wasilko, the former confessor of Elizabeth of Poland. The bishopric, which included Samogitia, then largely controlled by the Teutonic Order, was subordinated to the see of Gniezno and not to that of Teutonic Königsberg. The decision may not have improved Władysław&#x27;s relations with the Order, but it served to introduce closer ties between Lithuania and Poland, enabling the Polish church to freely assist its Lithuanian counterpart.

In 1389, Władysław&#x27;s rule in Lithuania faced a revived challenge from Vytautas, who resented the power given to Skirgaila in Lithuania at the expense of his own patrimony. Vytautas started a civil war in Lithuania, aiming to become the Grand Duke. On 4 September 1390, the joint forces of Vytautas and Grand Master Konrad von Wallenrode of the Teutonic Order, laid siege to Vilnius, which was held by Władysław&#x27;s regent Skirgaila with combined Polish, Lithuanian and Ruthenian troops. Although the Knights lifted the siege of the castle after a month, they reduced much of the outer city to ruins. This bloody conflict was eventually brought to a temporary halt in 1392 with the Treaty of Ostrów, by which Władysław handed over the government of Lithuania to his cousin in exchange for peace: Vytautas was to rule Lithuania as the grand duke (&quot;magnus dux&quot;) until his death, under the overlordship of the Supreme Duke (&quot;dux supremus&quot;) in the person of the Polish monarch. Skirgaila was moved from the Duchy of Trakai to become prince of Kiev. Vytautas initially accepted his status but soon began to pursue Lithuania&#x27;s independence from Poland.

The protracted period of war between the Lithuanians and the Teutonic Knights was ended on 12 October 1398 by the Treaty of Salynas, named after the islet in the Neman River where it was signed. Lithuania agreed to cede Samogitia and assist the Teutonic Order in a campaign to seize Pskov, while the Order agreed to assist Lithuania in a campaign to seize Novgorod. Shortly afterwards, Vytautas was crowned as a king by local nobles; but the following year his forces and those of his ally, Khan Tokhtamysh of the White Horde, were crushed by the Timurids at the Battle of the Vorskla River, ending his imperial ambitions in the east and obliging him to submit to Władysław&#x27;s protection once more.

==King of Poland==

===Early actions===

On 22 June 1399, Jadwiga gave birth to a daughter, baptised Elizabeth Bonifacia, but within a month the mother and daughter died, leaving Władysław sole ruler of the Kingdom of Poland and without an heir nor much legitimacy to rule the kingdom. Jadwiga&#x27;s death undermined Władysław&#x27;s right to the throne, and as a result old conflicts between the nobility of Lesser Poland, generally sympathetic to Władysław, and the gentry of Greater Poland began to surface. In 1402, Władysław answered the rumblings against his rule by marrying Anna of Cilli, a granddaughter of Casimir III of Poland, a political match that re-legitimized his reign.

The Union of Vilnius and Radom of 1401 confirmed the status of Vytautas as grand duke under Władysław&#x27;s overlordship while assuring the title of grand duke to the heirs of Władysław rather than those of Vytautas: should Władysław die without heirs, the Lithuanian boyars were to elect a new monarch. Since no heir had yet been produced by either monarch, the implications of the union were unforeseeable, but it forged bonds between the Polish and Lithuanian nobility and a permanent defensive alliance between the two states, strengthening Lithuania&#x27;s hand for a new war against the Teutonic Order in which Poland officially took no part. While the document left the liberties of the Polish nobles untouched, it granted increased power to the boyars of Lithuania, whose grand dukes had till then been unencumbered by checks and balances of the sort attached to the Polish monarchy. The Union of Vilnius and Radom therefore earned Władysław a measure of support in Lithuania.

In late 1401, the new war against the Order overstretched the resources of the Lithuanians, who found themselves fighting on two fronts after uprisings in the eastern provinces. Another of Władysław&#x27;s brothers, the malcontent Švitrigaila, chose this moment to stir up revolts behind the lines and declare himself grand duke. On 31 January 1402, he presented himself in Marienburg, where he won the backing of the Knights with concessions similar to those made by Jogaila and Vytautas during earlier leadership contests in the Grand Duchy.

===Against the Teutonic Order===

The war ended in the Treaty of Raciąż on 22 May 1404. Władysław acceded to the formal cession of Samogitia and agreed to support the Order&#x27;s designs on Pskov; in return, Konrad von Jungingen undertook to sell Poland the disputed Dobrzyń Land and the town of Złotoryja, once pawned to the Order by Władysław Opolski, and to support Vytautas in a revived attempt on Novgorod. Both sides had practical reasons for signing the treaty at that point: the Order needed time to fortify its newly acquired lands, the Poles and Lithuanians to deal with territorial challenges in the east and in Silesia.

Also in 1404, Władysław held talks at Vratislav with Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia, who offered to return Silesia to Poland if Władysław supported him in his power struggle within the Holy Roman Empire. Władysław turned the deal down with the agreement of both Polish and Silesian nobles, unwilling to burden himself with new military commitments in the west.

===Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic war===
In December 1408, Władysław and Vytautas held strategic talks in Navahrudak Castle, where they decided to foment a Samogitian uprising against Teutonic rule to draw German forces away from Pomerelia. Władysław promised to repay Vytautas for his support by restoring Samogitia to Lithuania in any future peace treaty. The uprising, which began in May 1409, at first provoked little reaction from the Knights, who had not yet consolidated their rule in Samogitia by building castles; but by June their diplomats were busy lobbying Władysław&#x27;s court at Oborniki, warning his nobles against Polish involvement in a war between Lithuania and the Order. Władysław, however, bypassed his nobles and informed the new Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen that if the Knights acted to suppress Samogitia, Poland would intervene. This stung the Order into issuing a declaration of war against Poland on 6 August, which Władysław received on 14 August in Nowy Korczyn.

The castles guarding the northern border were in such bad condition that the Knights easily captured those at Złotoryja, Dobrzyń and Bobrowniki, the capital of Dobrzyń Land, while German burghers invited them into Bydgoszcz (German: Bromberg). Władysław arrived on the scene in late September, retook Bydgoszcz within a week, and came to terms with the Order on 8 October. During the winter, the two armies prepared for a major confrontation. Władysław installed a strategic supply depot at Płock in Masovia and had a pontoon bridge constructed and transported north down the Vistula.

Meanwhile, both sides unleashed diplomatic offensives. The Knights dispatched letters to the monarchs of Europe, preaching their usual crusade against the heathens; Władysław countered with his letters to the monarchs, accusing the Order of planning to conquer the whole world. Such appeals successfully recruited many foreign knights to each side. Wenceslas IV of Bohemia signed a defensive treaty with the Poles against the Teutonic Order; his brother, Sigismund of Luxembourg, allied himself with the Order and declared war against Poland on 12 July, though his Hungarian vassals refused his call to arms.

===Battle of Grunwald===
When the war resumed in June 1410, Władysław advanced into the Teutonic heartland at the head of an army of about 20,000 mounted nobles, 15,000 armed commoners, and 2,000 professional cavalry mainly hired from Bohemia. After crossing the Vistula over the pontoon bridge at Czerwińsk, his troops met up with those of Vytautas, whose 11,000 light cavalry included Lithuanians, Ruthenians, and Tatars. The Teutonic Order&#x27;s army had about 18,000 cavalry, mostly Germans, and 5,000 infantry. On 15 July, at the Battle of Grunwald after one of the largest and most ferocious battles of the Middle Ages, the allies won a victory so overwhelming that the Teutonic Order&#x27;s army was virtually annihilated, with most of its key commanders killed in combat, including Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen and Grand Marshal Friedrich von Wallenrode. Thousands of troops were reportedly slaughtered on either side.

The road to the Teutonic capital Marienburg now lay open, the city undefended; but for reasons the sources do not explain, Władysław hesitated to pursue his advantage. On 17 July, his army began a laboured advance, arriving at Marienburg only on 25 July, by which time the new Grand Master, Heinrich von Plauen, had organised a defence of the fortress. The apparent half-heartedness of the ensuing siege, called off by Władysław on 19 September, has been variously ascribed to the impregnability of the fortifications, high Lithuanian casualties, to Władysław&#x27;s unwillingness to risk further casualties, or to his desire to keep the Order weakened but undefeated so as to not upset the balance of power between Poland (which would most likely acquire most of the Order possessions if it was totally defeated) and Lithuania; but a lack of sources precludes a definitive explanation.

===Dissent===

The war ended in 1411 with the Peace of Thorn, in which neither Poland nor Lithuania drove home negotiating advantages home to the full, much to the discontent of the Polish nobility. Poland regained Dobrzyń Land, Lithuania regained Samogitia, and Masovia regained a small territory beyond the Wkra river. Most of the Teutonic Order&#x27;s territory, however, including towns that had surrendered, remained intact. Władysław then released many high-ranking Teutonic Knights and officials for apparently modest ransoms. The cumulative expense of the ransoms, however, proved a drain on the Order&#x27;s resources. This failure to exploit the victory to his nobles&#x27; satisfaction provoked growing opposition to Władysław&#x27;s regime after 1411, further fueled by the granting of Podolia, disputed between Poland and Lithuania, to Vytautas, and by the king&#x27;s two-year absence in Lithuania.

In an effort to outflank his critics, Władysław promoted the leader of the opposing faction, bishop Mikołaj Trąba, to the archbishopric of Gniezno in autumn 1411 and replaced him in Kraków with Vytautas supporter Wojciech Jastrzębiec. He also sought to create more allies in Lithuania. The Union of Horodło on 2 October 1413 decreed that the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was &quot;tied to our Kingdom of Poland permanently and irreversibly&quot;, and granted the Catholic nobles of Lithuania privileges equal to those of Polish szlachta. The act included a clause prohibiting the Polish nobility from electing a monarch without the consent of the Lithuanian nobility, and the Lithuanian nobility from electing a grand duke without the consent of the Polish monarch.

===Last conflicts===
In 1414, a sporadic new war broke out, known as the &quot;Hunger War&quot; from the Knights&#x27; scorched-earth tactics of burning fields and mills; but both the Knights and the Lithuanians were too exhausted from the previous war to risk a major battle, and the fighting petered out in the autumn. Hostilities did not flare up again until 1419, during the Council of Constance, when they were called off at the papal legate&#x27;s insistence.

The Council of Constance proved a turning point in the Teutonic crusades, as it did for several European conflicts. Vytautas sent a delegation in 1415, including the metropolitan of Kiev and Samogitian witnesses; they arrived at Constance at the end of that year to express their preference for being &quot;baptised with water and not with blood&quot;. The Polish envoys, among them Mikołaj Trąba, Zawisza Czarny, and Paweł Włodkowic, lobbied for an end to the forced conversion of heathens and to the Order&#x27;s aggression against Lithuania and Poland. As a result of the Polish–Lithuanian diplomacy, the council, though scandalised by Włodkowic&#x27;s questioning of the legitimacy of the monastic state, denied the Order&#x27;s request for a further crusade and instead entrusted the conversion of the Samogitians to Poland–Lithuania.

The diplomatic context at Constance included the revolt of the Bohemian Hussites, who looked upon Poland as an ally in their wars against Sigismund, the emperor elect and new king of Bohemia. In 1421, the Bohemian Diet declared Sigismund deposed and formally offered the crown to Władysław on condition that he accept the religious principles of the Four Articles of Prague, which he was not prepared to do. After Władysław&#x27;s refusal, Vytautas was postulated (elected in absentia) as Bohemian king, but he assured the pope that he opposed the heretics. Between 1422 and 1428, Władysław&#x27;s nephew, Sigismund Korybut, attempted a regency in war-torn Bohemia, with little success. Vytautas accepted Sigismund&#x27;s offer of a royal crown in 1429—apparently with Władysław&#x27;s blessing—but Polish forces intercepted the crown in transit and the coronation was cancelled.

In 1422, Władysław fought another war, known as the Gollub War, against the Teutonic Order, defeating them in under two months before the Order&#x27;s imperial reinforcements had time to arrive. The resulting Treaty of Melno ended the Knights&#x27; claims to Samogitia once and for all and defined a permanent border between Prussia and Lithuania. Lithuania was given the province of Samogitia, with the port of Palanga, but the city of Klaipėda was left to the Order. This border remained largely unchanged for roughly 500 years, until 1920. The terms of this treaty have, however, been seen as turning a Polish victory into defeat, as a result of Władysław&#x27;s renunciation of Polish claims to Pomerania, Pomerelia, and Chełmno Land, for which he received only the town of Nieszawa in return. The Treaty of Melno closed a chapter in the Knights&#x27; wars with Lithuania but did little to settle their long-term issues with Poland. Further sporadic warfare broke out between Poland and the Knights between 1431 and 1435.

Cracks in the cooperation between Poland and Lithuania after the death of Vytautas in 1430 had offered the Knights a revived opportunity for interference in Poland. Władysław supported his brother Švitrigaila as grand duke of Lithuania, but when Švitrigaila, with the support of the Teutonic Order and dissatisfied Rus&#x27; nobles, rebelled against Polish overlordship in Lithuania, the Poles, under the leadership of Bishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki of Kraków, occupied Podolia, which Władysław had awarded to Lithuania in 1411, and Volhynia. In 1432, a pro-Polish party in Lithuania elected Vytautas&#x27;s brother Žygimantas as grand duke, leading to an armed struggle over the Lithuanian succession which stuttered on for years after Władysław&#x27;s death.

===Succession and death===

At the dying request of the childless Jadwiga, he married a Styrian lady, Anna of Celje. She died in 1416, leaving a daughter : 
* Hedwig (1408–1431). 
In 1417, Władysław married Elisabeth of Pilica, who died in 1420 without bearing him a child.&lt;br&gt; 
Two years later, he married Sophia of Halshany (niece of Uliana Olshanska), who bore him two surviving sons : 
* Władysław (1424–1444)
* Casimir (1427–1492) 
The death in 1431 of his daughter Hedwig (Jadwiga), the last heir of Piast blood, released Władysław to make his sons by Sophia of Halshany his heirs, though he had to placate the Polish nobility with concessions to ensure their agreement since the monarchy was elective. In 1427 the Polish nobles had initiated an anti-Jagiellonian movement, seeking to have Władysław and Casimir excluded from the Polish throne as they had no blood link to the previous ruling Polish dynasty, the Piasts.

During an excursion into Przemyśl Land in the 48th year of his reign, Władysław caught a cold from which he was unable to recover. He finally died in Grodek in 1434, leaving Poland to his elder son, Władysław III, and Lithuania to his younger, Casimir, both still minors at the time. The Lithuanian inheritance, however, could not be taken for granted. Władysław&#x27;s death ended the personal union between the two realms, and it was not clear what would take its place.

==Legacy==

Władysław is depicted on the obverse of the modernized 100 Polish złoty banknote.

The Jagiełło Oak, an ancient tree in Białowieża Forest, is named in honour of the fact that he initiated the tradition of royal hunting in the area.

In 2021, asteroid 2004 TP17 was officially named as Jogaila (the Lithuanian language variant of his name).

<text>The Security Service (; ), in full Security Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and commonly known as SB, was a secret police force established in the Polish People&#x27;s Republic in 1956 as a successor to the Ministry of Public Security (UB). The SB was the chief foreign and domestic security organization in Poland from 1956 until the fall of communism in 1989.

The parent agency of SB, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, had been established in 1954, but the Ministry did not play a significant role until the winding-up of the Committee for Public Safety in 1956. 

==History==
The post-World War II Ministry of Public Security (UB) was responsible for security, intelligence and counterintelligence. It controlled over 41,000 soldiers of the Internal Security Corps, 57,500 members of the Citizens&#x27; Militia, 32,000 border troops, 10,000 prison officers and 125,000 members of the Volunteer Reserve Citizen Militia.

After the 1954 defection to the West of Józef Światło (born Izaak Fleischfarb), a high-ranking Ministry of Public Security officer instrumental in arresting Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński, this Ministry of Public Security was abolished.

In December 1954, the Communist Party divided the old UB into two parts: the Committee for Public Security (&quot;Komitet do spraw Bezpieczeństwa Publicznego&quot;, or KDSBP) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MSW). The former was a secret police responsible for internal and external intelligence and counterintelligence to fight underground movements and the influence of the Catholic Church. The MSW was responsible for administrative duties, and eventually controlled the Internal Security Corps, militia, border troops, prison guards and the Volunteer Reserve Citizen Militia.

==1956 reform==
The year 1956 brought change to Polish politics. Recently released from prison, Władysław Gomułka became the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party. Reforms were made in the structure of state security. The Committee of Public Safety was abolished, and its duties were taken over by the MSW.

The introduction of Security Service to the Interior Ministry (which was already in the Polish public safety system since 1954), came as a result of directive number 00238/56 made by Władysław Wicha on 29 November 1956. Wicha was a Polish communist and politician PZPR member and then the first Minister of Internal Affairs from 1954 to 1964. After that his directive, the MSW was the only security body in Poland.

Officers working in the Security Service were nicknamed &quot;SB-eks&quot; (Służba Bezpieczeństwa agents). SB also contracted individuals as secret collaborators (Tajny Współpracownik or TW), who usually received money for the services rendered.

==Tasks and organizational structure==
The tasks of the Security Service were identical to that of its predecessors (MBP, UB and KdsBP): to protect the communist system in the country (and beyond) through control and penetration into all structures of social life in Poland and abroad. The centrally-based MSW was divided into departments, bureaus, sections and directorates. The following was observed in the SB after the agency was founded:

* Division I (Intelligence): Replaced I (1st) KdsBP Division in 1956.
* Division II (Counter-intelligence): Replaced II (2nd) KdsBP Division in 1956.
* Division III (Anti-State Activity): Replaced Divisions III-VI (3rd-6th) of the KdsBP in 1956. Later replaced with Division of protection of the constitutional order of the state in 1989.
* Division A (Ciphers): Replaced the A Department of KdsBP in 1956.
* Division B (Observation): Replaced the B section of KdsBP in 1956
* Division C (Operational Records): Replaced the X (10th) KdsBP Division in 1956.
* Division T (Operational Technology): Replaced the IX (9th) KdsBP Division in 1956.
* Division W (Correspondence Investigation): Replaced the W section of KdsBP in 1956
* Investigation Division: Replaced the VII (7th) KdsBP Division in 1956.
* Government Protection Division: Replaced the VIII (8th) KdsBP Division in 1956.
* Foreigner Registration Division: Operational assets taken from MO in 1960. In 1965, it was integrated to the Border Control Department.
* Division IV (Protection of churches and religious associations): Separated from Division III in 1962. From 1981–1984, it&#x27;s tasked to protect Polish agriculture. It was replaced in 1989 with Study and Analysis Division.
* Passports Division: Operational assets taken from MO in 1964. From 1972 to 1990, it was tasked to register foreigners living/working in Poland.
* RKW Division (Radio counter-intelligence): Separated from Division II in 1965. Integrated with Division A in 1989.
* Border Control Department: Operational assets taken from the Border Protection Troops in 1965. Worked alongside the FRD until BCD was sent back to the BPT in 1972 with some duties taken by Division II and MO. 
* Division IIIA / V (Operational protection of Industry): Originally separated from Division III in 1979. Later replaced in 1989 with Division of Economic Protection. Operational assets transferred from MO in 1981-82.
* Censorship Division: Operated during the martial law period of 1981. Intercepted phone calls and postal items. Involved SB agents from W and T Divisions.
* Study Division (Investigation of opposition), replaced in 1989 with Study and Analysis Division.
* Communication Division: Operational assets taken from MO in 1984.
* Division VI (Operational protection of Agriculture), replaced in 1989 with Division of Economic Protection.
* Officer Protection Division: Operational assets taken from MO in 1985.

=== 1981 SB Structure ===
The SB was further reorganized in 1981 due to reforms made by Czesław Kiszczak. This was made under Resolution No. 144 of the Council of Ministers of October 21, 1983 on granting the organizational statute to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, later amended by Resolution No. 128 of the Council of Ministers of August 22, 1989.

* Intelligence/Counter-intelligence Service
* Security Service
* Operational Security Service 
* Bureau of Investigation
* Government Protection Bureau
* Security Board Officers

==Ranks==
The following ranks were observed until 1990:

==Activities==
After it was renamed the SB in 1956, it entered a period of relative inactivity during the era of reform instituted by Władysław Gomułka. However, after 1968 it was revived as a stronger body responsible for political repression (most notably of the Solidarity movement, the leader of which, Lech Wałęsa, was under constant SB surveillance. Throughout the martial law (1981-1983), SB played a key role in wiretapping telephones in public areas and institutions. It also participated in infiltrating Solidarity&#x27;s committees and gatherings.

The torture and execution of Catholic priest Jerzy Popiełuszko by SB members (who were later convicted of murder) in 1984 shook Poland. The agency is also suspected of killing Stanisław Pyjas, Catholic priest Stefan Niedzielak, and is reported to have abused priest Roman Kotlarz, who died mysteriously after a beating.

==Victims==
An infamous case was the torture and execution by the SB of Catholic priest Jerzy Popiełuszko in 1984. Since 1990, several SB operatives have been tried for their crimes. The SB is also suspected of killing Stanisław Pyjas and Catholic priest Stefan Niedzielak. It is reported to have abused priest Roman Kotlarz, who died mysteriously after a beating.

==In popular culture==
The SB is featured in the Polish TV series &quot;1983&quot; which is set in an alternative 2003 where Poland is still a communist country.

Known as the SG coaxial cable system, designed by Bell Labs, the cable is with repeater spacing of .
The deep sea portion, some in length, was laid by the Cable Ship &quot;Long Lines&quot;, owned by AT&amp;T. Portions of the shore sections were laid by the French Cable Ship &quot;Vercors&quot;.

The SG Undersea Cable System was designed by Bell Laboratories at their Allentown, PA, Greensboro, NC, Holmdel, NJ, and Whippany, NJ facilities.

A few years later, TAT-7 was put into service between Tuckerton, New Jersey, and Lands End, England, and was the last analog Transatlantic undersea system.

The following system, TAT-8, was implemented by AT&amp;T Corp. (with Bell Laboratories), STC (with British Telecom), and Alcatel (with France Telecom). This was the first Transatlantic fiber-optic system, had greatly increased capacity and performance.

<text>TAT-8 was the 8th transatlantic communications cable and first transatlantic fiber-optic cable, carrying 280 Mbit/s (40,000 telephone circuits) between the United States, United Kingdom and France. It was constructed in 1988 by a consortium of companies led by AT&amp;T Corporation, France Télécom, and British Telecom. AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories developed the technologies used in the cable. The system was made possible by opto-electric-opto regenerators acting as repeaters with advantages over the electrical repeaters of former cables. They were less costly and could be at greater spacing with less need for associated hardware and software. It was able to serve the three countries with a single transatlantic crossing with the use of an innovative branching unit located underwater on the continental shelf off the coast of Great Britain. The cable lands in Tuckerton, New Jersey, USA, Widemouth Bay, England, UK, and Penmarch, France.

The system was built at an initial cost of US$335 million in 1988 and was retired from service in 2002. Capacity was reached in eighteen months despite optimistic predictions that the capacity would not be filled for a decade and some that it would never be filled and no other cables would be needed.

==History==

This was the first transatlantic cable to use optical fibers, a revolution in telecommunications. The system contained two working pairs of optical fibers; a third fiber pair (in the AT&amp;T segment only) was reserved as a span-wise spare. The signal on each optical fiber was modulated at 295.6 Mbit/s (carrying 280 Mbit/s of traffic) and fully regenerated in equipment placed in pressure housings separated by about 40 km of cable.

There were several problems with the early reliability of this cable during its first two years of operation. The cable was buried on the continental shelf on the European and the American side of the ocean. The burial was largely effective, and the cable issues were primarily related to manufacturing defects. AT&amp;T laid a trial optical cable in the Canary Islands in 1985. This cable did not have an electrical screen and was attacked by sharks. It was never proved whether these attacks were due to the sharks sensing the electrical radiation from the cable or the vibration of the cable moving on the sea floor where it might have been suspended, or a combination of both. TAT-8 did not have the screen conductor over the vast majority of its length, as the threat of shark attack was deemed to be small over the majority of the route. Because the Canary Island cable was the first fiber-optic cable and not a coaxial cable, the electrical interference shielding for the high voltage supply lines was removed. This removal did not affect the fiber, but it did cause feeding frenzies in sharks that swam nearby. The sharks would then attack the cable until the voltage lines killed them. This caused numerous, prolonged outages. Eventually, a shark shielding was developed for the cable and was available for TAT-8. PTAT-1, the next cable to go in the Atlantic was put in with the shark shielding across its entire length; the added reliability provided by this shield has not been fully evaluated.

The system was manufactured by a consortium of three established submarine system suppliers: AT&amp;T, Standard Telephones and Cables and Alcatel. The idea was that each manufacturer would manufacture part of the system, so French technology procured by France Télécom would land in France, US technology in America procured by AT&amp;T and British technology procured by BT in the UK. The systems were designed to interoperate although the regenerator supervisory systems were all proprietary. The transition between one supplier to another supplier&#x27;s regenerators was achieved using a &quot;mid-span meet&quot;. AT&amp;T was appointed the integration coordinator and integration trials were held in Freehold, New Jersey.

==Impact==

In 1989, with the new available capacity due to the TAT-8 cable, IBM agreed to fund a dedicated T1 link between Cornell University and CERN, which was completed in February 1990. It greatly increased the connectivity between the American and European portions of the early Internet. This allowed Tim Berners-Lee a high-speed, direct and open connection to the NSFNET, which greatly aided the first demonstrations of the World Wide Web ten months later. It was also crucial, along with the collapse of the Warsaw Pact at the same time, to the acceptance of TCP/IP protocols in Europe.

<text>TAT-9 was the 9th transatlantic telephone cable system, in operation from 1992 to 2004, operating at 560 Mbit/s (80,000 telephone circuits) between Europe (Goonhilly, United Kingdom; Saint-Hilaire-de-Riez, France; Conil de la Frontera, Spain) and North America (Manahawkin, United States; Pennant Point, Nova Scotia, Canada). It was built by an international consortium of co-owners and suppliers. Co-owners included AT&amp;T Corporation, British Telecom and France Telecom.

TAT-9 was the first fiber optic system to operate at 565 Mbit/s, twice the speed of the first transatlantic fiber optic system, TAT-8. It was also the first system to have the ability to switch traffic on demand between the five landing points: Canada, the United States, France, Spain and the United Kingdom. This enabled the smaller countries in the network to afford their own landing points, and also allowed the network to accommodate for large changes in traffic demands at any individual station, such as the dramatic increase during the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona.

The first-ever fiber optic switching devices that allowed for switching were called Undersea Branching Multiplexers (UBMs).</text><links>

<text>TAT-12/13 is a ring cable system consisting of the 12th and 13th consortia transatlantic telephone cables, in operation from 1996, initially carrying 2 × 5 Gbit/s.

This was the first TAT cable to use a ring structure, involving two stretches of cable across the ocean floor, which explains why two numbers (12 and 13) were used. All later cables also use a ring structure, but only use one number (TAT-14 etc.). The cable connected between Long Island (at Shirley, New York), USA; Green Hill, Rhode Island, USA; Porthcurno, UK; Bude, UK; and Penmarch, France.

The cable was constructed for US$740 million and was supplied jointly by AT&amp;T Submarine Systems, Inc (now TE Subcom owned by TE Connectivity), STC Submarine Systems (acquired by Alcatel-Lucent) and Alcatel Submarcom. Ring switching equipment was provided by the Toshiba Corporation in each of the four cable stations.

The cables in this system were the first on the trans-Atlantic route to make use of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers.

The TAT-12/13 consortia removed the cable from normal commercial service on 31 December 2008.

<text>TAT-14 was the 14th consortium transatlantic telecommunications cable system. In operation from 2001 to 2020, it used wavelength division multiplexing. The cable system was built from multiple pairs of fibres—one fibre in each pair was used for data carried in one direction and the other in the opposite direction. Although optical fibre can be used in both directions simultaneously, for reliability it is better not to require splitting equipment at the end of the individual fibre to separate transmit and receive signals—hence a fibre pair is used. TAT-14 used four pairs of fibres—two pairs as active and two as backup. Each fibre in each pair carried 16 wavelengths in one direction, and each wavelength carried up to an STM-256 (38,486,016 kbit/s as payload). The fibres were bundled into submarine cables connecting the United States and the European Union (United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark) in a ring topology.

By the time this cable went into operation, the expected &quot;long boom&quot; (term coined by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine) was already ending in the &quot;dot-com death&quot;. The overinvestment in transcontinental optical fiber capacity led to a financial crisis in private cable operators like Global Crossing.

In the diplomatic cables leak, it is revealed that the landing point in Katwijk, the Netherlands is included in a US Government list of critical infrastructure susceptible to terrorist attack.

Use of the cable was ceased on December 15, 2020, shortly after the Havfrue cable, whose main trunk also lands at Blaabjerg, was lit in November 2020. In 2021 the permanent dismantling of the system was begun.

== Cable failure ==

In November 2003, TAT-14 suffered two breaks within weeks of each other, first on the southern link between the US and UK, then on the link between France and the Netherlands which had been providing redundant service to the UK via the northern link through Denmark, resulting in disruption to Internet services in the United Kingdom.

On May 19, 2014, preliminary reports from hosting provider Digital Ocean suggested that TAT-14 was the cause for the disrupted services between the EU and the US.

==Decommissioning of the TAT-14==
Subsea Environmental Services has removed and recycled the cable shore-ends in the U.S., U.K., France, Denmark and The Netherlands as well as the deep-water segments in the North Atlantic.

<text>CANTAT-1 was the first Canadian transatlantic telephone cable, between Hampden, Newfoundland and eventually Grosses-Roches, Quebec and Oban, United Kingdom, which followed on from the success of TAT-1. It was conceived and approved as stage one of a proposed commonwealth round the world cable and was done at a cost of $8,500,000. The system was jointly owned by Cable &amp; Wireless and the Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation (COTC).

The system, involving the first commercial use of a new lightweight deep sea cable with a weight in water of about one-fifth that of armored deep sea cable, was laid in two phases. The first, CANTAT A, was the ocean section laid by HMTS &quot;Monarch&quot; with the U.K. shore end laid by HMTS &quot;Ariel&quot; and the Canadian end laid by the U.S. Army CS &quot;Albert J. Myer&quot;. The second phase, linked by overland cable from Hampden to Corner Brook, Newfoundland, was the segment laid by HMTS CS &quot;Alert&quot; with both shore ends laid by CS &quot;Hadsund&quot;.

The new Trans Atlantic cables, TAT-1, CANTAT-1 and TAT-2, with their high capacity brought about a major change in regulations, with specific changes in the U.S. Federal Communications Commission policies regarding lease of foreign cable channels by U.S. international record carriers. CANTAT-1 operated from 1961 to 1986, initially carrying 60 telephone circuits, later modified from 4 kHz channels to 3 kHz channels, expanding capacity to 80 telephone circuits.

<text>CANTAT-2 was the second Canadian transatlantic telephone cable,
in operation from 1974 to 1992.
It could carry 1,840 simultaneous telephone calls
between Beaver Harbour, Nova Scotia and England. The parties involved were Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation (now Teleglobe) and the British General Post Office. The cable was rerouted to Sable Island and renamed SITIFOG 2000 for a period, and was eventually decommissioned. 

The work on the U.K. end of the cable involved an accident in which &quot;Pisces III&quot;, engaged in repeater burial of the newly laid cable on the shelf off Ireland, sank. The submersible sank in of water and was recovered with the crew safe after 76 hours.

== History ==
CANTAT-3 is the only NL-16 laser regenerative 2.5 Gig/s submarine system built in the world. Part of this huge system was built at STC Submarine Networks, Portland, Oregon, USA, from 1993–1994 (which later became Alcatel Submarine Networks). STC Submarine Networks in Southampton, Hampshire, UK, made the rest of the system. The Canadian portion (shore end system) was laid off Nova Scotia by the Teleglobe cable ship CS John Cabot. The main-lay portion was deployed off Nova Scotia towards the Faroes on board the AT&amp;T ship Global Mariner. Other cable ships were involved in the completion of this system. This was the northernmost cable system ever deployed at the time.

CANTAT-3 was operated by India&#x27;s Teleglobe.

On December 17, 2006, CANTAT-3 services were disrupted due to damage to the submarine cable, resulting in degradation of service to hundreds of thousands of users connecting via internet and media providers (Síminn, Vodafone and Hive). The country was however backed up by the second submarine cable, FARICE-1 The most notable effect of the event was a temporary shut-down of data communications by Iceland&#x27;s universities and hospitals, which relied exclusively on CANTAT-3&#x27;s services. Although it was predicted that a full recovery of the cable would take ten days, starting from midnight on January 13, 2007, it actually took until July 29, 2007 before service was fully restored. During that time, the Icelandic universities and hospitals in Akureyri and Reykjavík relied on emergency connectivity obtained via local internet providers Síminn and Vodafone. The Icelandic government decided not to buy extra bandwidth for the university network through the functioning FARICE-1 cable, despite being a large shareholder in FARICE-1.

Given that CANTAT-3 suffered multiple interruptions, the alternative cables FARICE-1, DANICE and Greenland Connect were established and/or expanded to ensure cabled telecommunication connectivity in Iceland. CANTAT-3 also had too little capacity by 2007 for domestic Internet usage, and became outdated as soon as the DANICE cable came into operation by 2009.

== Usage ==
Føroya Tele (Faroese Telecom) took over ownership and operation of the cable in 2012 to service oil platforms in the North Sea. 

As of 2022, CANTAT-3 is still in use and is powered from the Faroe Islands, Germany, Denmark and Valdemar Oil Platforms. Given its obsolete bandwidth capacity, providing service to oil platforms is the currently the primary function of CANTAT-3. The transatlantic portion as well as the spur to England is no longer in operation and has not been replaced.
