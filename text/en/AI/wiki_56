<text>The spy film, also known as the spy thriller, is a genre of film that deals with the subject of fictional espionage, either in a realistic way (such as the adaptations of John le Carré) or as a basis for fantasy (such as many James Bond films). Many novels in the spy fiction genre have been adapted as films, including works by John Buchan, le Carré, Ian Fleming (Bond) and Len Deighton. It is a significant aspect of British cinema, with leading British directors such as Alfred Hitchcock and Carol Reed making notable contributions and many films set in the British Secret Service.

Spy films show the espionage activities of government agents and their risk of being discovered by their enemies. From the Nazi espionage thrillers of the 1940s to the James Bond films of the 1960s and to the high-tech blockbusters of today, the spy film has always been popular with audiences worldwide. Offering a combination of exciting escapism, technological thrills, and locales, many spy films combine the action and science fiction genres, presenting clearly delineated heroes for audiences to root for and villains they want to see defeated. They may also involve elements of political thrillers. However, there are many that are comedic (mostly action comedy films if they fall under that genre).

James Bond is the most famous of film spies, but there were also more serious, probing works like le Carré&#x27;s &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; that also emerged from the Cold War. As the Cold War ended, the newest villain became terrorism and more often involved the Middle East.

==History==
The spy film genre began in the silent era, with the paranoia of invasion literature and the onset of the Great War. These fears produced the British 1914 &quot;The German Spy Peril&quot;, centered on a plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament, and 1913&#x27;s &quot;O.H.M.S.&quot;, standing for &quot;Our Helpless Millions Saved&quot; as well as On His Majesty&#x27;s Service (and introducing for the first time a strong female character who helps the hero).

In 1928, Fritz Lang made the film &quot;Spies&quot; which contained many tropes that became popular in later spy dramas, including secret headquarters, an agent known by a number, and the beautiful foreign agent who comes to love the hero. Lang&#x27;s Dr. Mabuse films from the period also contain elements of spy thrillers, though the central character is a criminal mastermind only interested in espionage for profit. Additionally, several of Lang&#x27;s American films, such as &quot;Hangmen Also Die&quot;, deal with spies during World War II.

Alfred Hitchcock did much to popularize the spy film in the 1930s with his influential thrillers &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1934), &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1935), &quot;Sabotage&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; (1938). These often involved innocent civilians being caught up in international conspiracies or webs of saboteurs on the home front, as in &quot;Saboteur&quot; (1942). Some, however, dealt with professional spies, as in Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Secret Agent&quot; (1936), based on W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;&quot; stories, or the Mr. Moto series, based on the books of John P. Marquand.

In the 1940s and early 1950s, several films were made about the exploits of Allied agents in occupied Europe, which could be considered a subgenre. &quot;13 Rue Madeleine&quot; and &quot;O.S.S.&quot; were fictional stories about American agents in German-occupied France. There were several films based on the stories of real-life British S.O.E. agents, including &quot;Odette&quot; and &quot;Carve Her Name With Pride&quot;. A more recent fictional example is &quot;Charlotte Gray&quot;, based on the novel by Sebastian Faulks.

Also during the period, there were many detective films (&quot;The Thin Man Goes Home&quot; and &quot;Charlie Chan in the Secret Service&quot; for example) in which the mystery involved who stole the secret blue-prints, or who kidnapped the famous scientist.

In the mid-1950s, Alfred Hitchcock returned to the spy genre with &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)&quot;, a remake of his 1934 film of the same name. He followed this up in 1959 with &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959), widely considered one of the most influential works within the spy genre. 

The peak of popularity of spy films is often considered to be the 1960s when Cold War fears meshed with a desire by audiences to see exciting and suspenseful films. The espionage film developed in two directions at this time. On the one hand, the realistic spy novels of Len Deighton and John le Carré were adapted into relatively serious Cold War thrillers that dealt with some of the realities of the espionage world. Some of these films included &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; (1965), &quot;The Deadly Affair&quot; (1966), &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; (1966), and the &quot;Harry Palmer&quot; series, based on the novels of Len Deighton.

In another direction, the &quot;James Bond&quot; novels by Ian Fleming were adapted into an increasingly fantastical series of tongue-in-cheek adventure films by producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, with Sean Connery as the star. They featured secretive and flamboyant supervillains, an archetype that would later become a staple of the explosion of spy movies in the mid-to-late 1960s.
The phenomenal success of the &quot;Bond&quot; series leads to a deluge of imitators, such as the eurospy genre and several from America. Notable examples include the two &quot;Derek Flint&quot; films starring James Coburn, &quot;The Quiller Memorandum&quot; (1966) with George Segal, and the &quot;Matt Helm&quot; series with Dean Martin. Television also got into the act with series like &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E&quot; and &quot;I Spy&quot; in the U.S., and &quot;Danger Man&quot; and &quot;The Avengers&quot; in Britain. Spies have remained popular on TV to the present day with series such as &quot;Callan&quot;, &quot;Alias&quot; and &quot;Spooks&quot;.

Spy films also enjoyed something of a revival in the late 1990s, although these were often action films with espionage elements or comedies like &quot;Austin Powers&quot;. Some critics identify a trend away from fantasy in favor of realism, as observed in &quot;Syriana&quot;, the &quot;Bourne&quot; film series and the &quot;James Bond&quot; films starring Daniel Craig since &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006).

<text>The Greeks or Hellenes (; , ) are an ethnic group and nation native to Greece, Cyprus, southern Albania, Anatolia, parts of Italy and Egypt, and to a lesser extent, other countries surrounding the Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea. They also form a significant diaspora (), with many Greek communities established around the world.

Greek colonies and communities have been historically established on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, but the Greek people themselves have always been centered on the Aegean and Ionian seas, where the Greek language has been spoken since the Bronze Age. Until the early 20th century, Greeks were distributed between the Greek peninsula, the western coast of Asia Minor, the Black Sea coast, Cappadocia in central Anatolia, Egypt, the Balkans, Cyprus, and Constantinople. Many of these regions coincided to a large extent with the borders of the Byzantine Empire of the late 11th century and the Eastern Mediterranean areas of ancient Greek colonization. The cultural centers of the Greeks have included Athens, Thessalonica, Alexandria, Smyrna, and Constantinople at various periods.

In recent times, most ethnic Greeks live within the borders of the modern Greek state or in Cyprus. The Greek genocide and population exchange between Greece and Turkey nearly ended the three millennia-old Greek presence in Asia Minor. Other longstanding Greek populations can be found from southern Italy to the Caucasus and southern Russia and Ukraine and in the Greek diaspora communities in a number of other countries. Today, most Greeks are officially registered as members of the Greek Orthodox Church.

Greeks have greatly influenced and contributed to culture, visual arts, exploration, theatre, literature, philosophy, ethics, politics, architecture, music, mathematics, medicine, science, technology, commerce, cuisine and sports. The Greek language is the oldest recorded living language and its vocabulary has been the basis of many languages, including English as well as international scientific nomenclature. Greek was the most widely spoken &quot;lingua franca&quot; in the Mediterranean world since the fourth century BC and the New Testament of the Christian Bible was also originally written in Greek.

==History==

The Greeks speak the Greek language, which forms its own unique branch within the Indo-European family of languages, the Hellenic. They are part of a group of classical ethnicities, described by Anthony D. Smith as an &quot;archetypal diaspora people&quot;.

===Origins===

The Proto-Greeks probably arrived at the area now called Greece, in the southern tip of the Balkan peninsula, at the end of the 3rd millennium BC between 2200 and 1900 BC. The sequence of migrations into the Greek mainland during the 2nd millennium BC has to be reconstructed on the basis of the ancient Greek dialects, as they presented themselves centuries later and are therefore subject to some uncertainties. There were at least two migrations, the first being the Ionians and Achaeans, which resulted in Mycenaean Greece by the 16th century BC, and the second, the Dorian invasion, around the 11th century BC, displacing the Arcadocypriot dialects, which descended from the Mycenaean period. Both migrations occur at incisive periods, the Mycenaean at the transition to the Late Bronze Age and the Doric at the Bronze Age collapse.

===Mycenaean===

In 1600 BC, the Mycenaean Greeks borrowed from the Minoan civilization its syllabic writing system (Linear A) and developed their own syllabic script known as Linear B, providing the first and oldest written evidence of Greek. The Mycenaeans quickly penetrated the Aegean Sea and, by the 15th century BC, had reached Rhodes, Crete, Cyprus and the shores of Asia Minor.

Around 1200 BC, the Dorians, another Greek-speaking people, followed from Epirus. Older historical research often proposed Dorian invasion caused the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization, but this narrative has been abandoned in all contemporary research. It is likely that one of the factors which contributed to the Mycenaean palatial collapse was linked to raids by groups known in historiography as the &quot;Sea Peoples&quot; who sailed into the eastern Mediterranean around 1180 BC. The Dorian invasion was followed by a poorly attested period of migrations, appropriately called the Greek Dark Ages, but by 800 BC the landscape of Archaic and Classical Greece was discernible.

The Greeks of classical antiquity idealized their Mycenaean ancestors and the Mycenaean period as a glorious era of heroes, closeness of the gods and material wealth. The Homeric Epics (i.e. &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;) were especially and generally accepted as part of the Greek past and it was not until the time of Euhemerism that scholars began to question Homer&#x27;s historicity. As part of the Mycenaean heritage that survived, the names of the gods and goddesses of Mycenaean Greece (e.g. Zeus, Poseidon and Hades) became major figures of the Olympian Pantheon of later antiquity.

===Classical===

The ethnogenesis of the Greek nation is linked to the development of Pan-Hellenism in the 8th century BC. According to some scholars, the foundational event was the Olympic Games in 776 BC, when the idea of a common Hellenism among the Greek tribes was first translated into a shared cultural experience and Hellenism was primarily a matter of common culture. The works of Homer (i.e. &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;) and Hesiod (i.e. &quot;Theogony&quot;) were written in the 8th century BC, becoming the basis of the national religion, ethos, history and mythology. The Oracle of Apollo at Delphi was established in this period.

The classical period of Greek civilization covers a time spanning from the early 5th century BC to the death of Alexander the Great, in 323 BC (some authors prefer to split this period into &quot;Classical&quot;, from the end of the Greco-Persian Wars to the end of the Peloponnesian War, and &quot;Fourth Century&quot;, up to the death of Alexander). It is so named because it set the standards by which Greek civilization would be judged in later eras. The Classical period is also described as the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Greek civilization, and its art, philosophy, architecture and literature would be instrumental in the formation and development of Western culture.

While the Greeks of the classical era understood themselves to belong to a common Hellenic genos, their first loyalty was to their city and they saw nothing incongruous about warring, often brutally, with other Greek city-states. The Peloponnesian War, the large scale civil war between the two most powerful Greek city-states Athens and Sparta and their allies, left both greatly weakened.
Most of the feuding Greek city-states were, in some scholars&#x27; opinions, united by force under the banner of Philip&#x27;s and Alexander the Great&#x27;s Pan-Hellenic ideals, though others might generally opt, rather, for an explanation of &quot;Macedonian conquest for the sake of conquest&quot; or at least conquest for the sake of riches, glory and power and view the &quot;ideal&quot; as useful propaganda directed towards the city-states.

In any case, Alexander&#x27;s toppling of the Achaemenid Empire, after his victories at the battles of the Granicus, Issus and Gaugamela, and his advance as far as modern-day Pakistan and Tajikistan, provided an important outlet for Greek culture, via the creation of colonies and trade routes along the way. While the Alexandrian empire did not survive its creator&#x27;s death intact, the cultural implications of the spread of Hellenism across much of the Middle East and Asia were to prove long lived as Greek became the &quot;lingua franca&quot;, a position it retained even in Roman times. Many Greeks settled in Hellenistic cities like Alexandria, Antioch and Seleucia.

===Hellenistic===

The Hellenistic civilization was the next period of Greek civilization, the beginnings of which are usually placed at Alexander&#x27;s death. This Hellenistic age, so called because it saw the partial Hellenization of many non-Greek cultures, extending all the way into India and Bactria, both of which maintained Greek cultures and governments for centuries. The end is often placed around conquest of Egypt by Rome in 30 BC, although the Indo-Greek kingdoms lasted for a few more decades.

This age saw the Greeks move towards larger cities and a reduction in the importance of the city-state. These larger cities were parts of the still larger Kingdoms of the Diadochi. Greeks, however, remained aware of their past, chiefly through the study of the works of Homer and the classical authors. An important factor in maintaining Greek identity was contact with &quot;barbarian&quot; (non-Greek) peoples, which was deepened in the new cosmopolitan environment of the multi-ethnic Hellenistic kingdoms. This led to a strong desire among Greeks to organize the transmission of the Hellenic &quot;paideia&quot; to the next generation. Greek science, technology and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the Hellenistic period.

In the Indo-Greek and Greco-Bactrian kingdoms, Greco-Buddhism was spreading and Greek missionaries would play an important role in propagating it to China. Further east, the Greeks of Alexandria Eschate became known to the Chinese people as the Dayuan.

===Roman Empire===

Between 168 BC and 30 BC, the entire Greek world was conquered by Rome, and almost all of the world&#x27;s Greek speakers lived as citizens or subjects of the Roman Empire. Despite their military superiority, the Romans admired and became heavily influenced by the achievements of Greek culture, hence Horace&#x27;s famous statement: &quot;Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit&quot; (&quot;Greece, although captured, took its wild conqueror captive&quot;). In the centuries following the Roman conquest of the Greek world, the Greek and Roman cultures merged into a single Greco-Roman culture.

In the religious sphere, this was a period of profound change. The spiritual revolution that took place, saw a waning of the old Greek religion, whose decline beginning in the 3rd century BC continued with the introduction of new religious movements from the East. The cults of deities like Isis and Mithra were introduced into the Greek world. Greek-speaking communities of the Hellenized East were instrumental in the spread of early Christianity in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, and Christianity&#x27;s early leaders and writers (notably Saint Paul) were generally Greek-speaking, though none were from Greece proper. However, Greece itself had a tendency to cling to paganism and was not one of the influential centers of early Christianity: in fact, some ancient Greek religious practices remained in vogue until the end of the 4th century, with some areas such as the southeastern Peloponnese remaining pagan until well into the mid-Byzantine 10th century AD. The region of Tsakonia remained pagan until the ninth century and as such its inhabitants were referred to as &quot;Hellenes&quot;, in the sense of being pagan, by their Christianized Greek brethren in mainstream Byzantine society.

While ethnic distinctions still existed in the Roman Empire, they became secondary to religious considerations, and the renewed empire used Christianity as a tool to support its cohesion and promote a robust Roman national identity. From the early centuries of the Common Era, the Greeks self-identified as Romans (Greek: &quot;Rhōmaîoi&quot;). By that time, the name &quot;Hellenes&quot; denoted pagans but was revived as an ethnonym in the 11th century.

===Middle Ages===

During most of the Middle Ages, the Byzantine Greeks self-identified as &quot;Rhōmaîoi&quot; (, &quot;Romans&quot;, meaning citizens of the Roman Empire), a term which in the Greek language had become synonymous with Christian Greeks. The Latinizing term &quot;Graikoí&quot; (Γραικοί, &quot;Greeks&quot;) was also used, though its use was less common, and nonexistent in official Byzantine political correspondence, prior to the Fourth Crusade of 1204. The Eastern Roman Empire (today conventionally named the &quot;Byzantine Empire&quot;, a name not used during its own time) became increasingly influenced by Greek culture after the 7th century when Emperor Heraclius ( 610–641 AD) decided to make Greek the empire&#x27;s official language. Although the Catholic Church recognized the Eastern Empire&#x27;s claim to the Roman legacy for several centuries, after Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne, king of the Franks, as the &quot;Roman Emperor&quot; on 25 December 800, an act which eventually led to the formation of the Holy Roman Empire, the Latin West started to favour the Franks and began to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire largely as the &quot;Empire of the Greeks&quot; (&quot;Imperium Graecorum&quot;). While this Latin term for the ancient &quot;Hellenes&quot; could be used neutrally, its use by Westerners from the 9th century onwards in order to challenge Byzantine claims to ancient Roman heritage rendered it a derogatory exonym for the Byzantines who barely used it, mostly in contexts relating to the West, such as texts relating to the Council of Florence, to present the Western viewpoint. Additionally, among the Germanic and the Slavic peoples, the &quot;Rhōmaîoi&quot; were just called Greeks.

There are three schools of thought regarding this Byzantine Roman identity in contemporary Byzantine scholarship: The first considers &quot;Romanity&quot; the mode of self-identification of the subjects of a multi-ethnic empire at least up to the 12th century, where the average subject identified as Roman; a perennialist approach, which views Romanity as the medieval expression of a continuously existing Greek nation; while a third view considers the eastern Roman identity as a pre-modern national identity. The Byzantine Greeks&#x27; essential values were drawn from both Christianity and the Homeric tradition of ancient Greece.

A distinct Greek identity re-emerged in the 11th century in educated circles and became more forceful after the fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade in 1204. In the Empire of Nicaea, a small circle of the elite used the term &quot;Hellene&quot; as a term of self-identification. For example, in a letter to Pope Gregory IX, the Nicaean emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes (r. 1221–1254) claimed to have received the gift of royalty from Constantine the Great, and put emphasis on his &quot;Hellenic&quot; descent, exalting the wisdom of the Greek people. After the Byzantines recaptured Constantinople, however, in 1261, &quot;Rhomaioi&quot; became again dominant as a term for self-description and there are few traces of &quot;Hellene&quot; (Έλληνας), such as in the writings of George Gemistos Plethon, who abandoned Christianity and in whose writings culminated the secular tendency in the interest in the classical past. However, it was the combination of Orthodox Christianity with a specifically Greek identity that shaped the Greeks&#x27; notion of themselves in the empire&#x27;s twilight years. In the twilight years of the Byzantine Empire, prominent Byzantine personalities proposed referring to the Byzantine Emperor as the &quot;Emperor of the Hellenes&quot;. These largely rhetorical expressions of Hellenic identity were confined within intellectual circles, but were continued by Byzantine intellectuals who participated in the Italian Renaissance.

The interest in the Classical Greek heritage was complemented by a renewed emphasis on Greek Orthodox identity, which was reinforced in the late Medieval and Ottoman Greeks&#x27; links with their fellow Orthodox Christians in the Russian Empire. These were further strengthened following the fall of the Empire of Trebizond in 1461, after which and until the second Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29 hundreds of thousands of Pontic Greeks fled or migrated from the Pontic Alps and Armenian Highlands to southern Russia and the Russian South Caucasus (see also Greeks in Russia, Greeks in Armenia, Greeks in Georgia, and Caucasian Greeks).

These Byzantine Greeks were largely responsible for the preservation of the literature of the classical era. Byzantine grammarians were those principally responsible for carrying, in person and in writing, ancient Greek grammatical and literary studies to the West during the 15th century, giving the Italian Renaissance a major boost. The Aristotelian philosophical tradition was nearly unbroken in the Greek world for almost two thousand years, until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.

To the Slavic world, the Byzantine Greeks contributed by the dissemination of literacy and Christianity. The most notable example of the later was the work of the two Byzantine Greek brothers, the monks Saints Cyril and Methodius from the port city of Thessalonica, capital of the theme of Thessalonica, who are credited today with formalizing the first Slavic alphabet.

===Ottoman Empire===
Following the Fall of Constantinople on 29 May 1453, many Greeks sought better employment and education opportunities by leaving for the West, particularly Italy, Central Europe, Germany and Russia. Greeks are greatly credited for the European cultural revolution, later called the Renaissance. In Greek-inhabited territory itself, Greeks came to play a leading role in the Ottoman Empire, due in part to the fact that the central hub of the empire, politically, culturally, and socially, was based on Western Thrace and Macedonia, both in Northern Greece, and of course was centred on the mainly Greek-populated, former Byzantine capital, Constantinople. As a direct consequence of this situation, Greek-speakers came to play a hugely important role in the Ottoman trading and diplomatic establishment, as well as in the church. Added to this, in the first half of the Ottoman period men of Greek origin made up a significant proportion of the Ottoman army, navy, and state bureaucracy, having been levied as adolescents (along with especially Albanians and Serbs) into Ottoman service through the devshirme. Many Ottomans of Greek (or Albanian or Serb) origin were therefore to be found within the Ottoman forces which governed the provinces, from Ottoman Egypt, to Ottomans occupied Yemen and Algeria, frequently as provincial governors.

For those that remained under the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s millet system, religion was the defining characteristic of national groups (&quot;milletler&quot;), so the exonym &quot;Greeks&quot; (&quot;Rumlar&quot; from the name Rhomaioi) was applied by the Ottomans to all members of the Orthodox Church, regardless of their language or ethnic origin. The Greek speakers were the only ethnic group to actually call themselves &quot;Romioi&quot;, (as opposed to being so named by others) and, at least those educated, considered their ethnicity (&quot;genos&quot;) to be Hellenic. There were, however, many Greeks who escaped the second-class status of Christians inherent in the Ottoman millet system, according to which Muslims were explicitly awarded senior status and preferential treatment. These Greeks either emigrated, particularly to their fellow Orthodox Christian protector, the Russian Empire, or simply converted to Islam, often only very superficially and whilst remaining crypto-Christian. The most notable examples of large-scale conversion to Turkish Islam among those today defined as Greek Muslims—excluding those who had to convert as a matter of course on being recruited through the devshirme—were to be found in Crete (Cretan Turks), Greek Macedonia (for example among the Vallahades of western Macedonia), and among Pontic Greeks in the Pontic Alps and Armenian Highlands. Several Ottoman sultans and princes were also of part Greek origin, with mothers who were either Greek concubines or princesses from Byzantine noble families, one famous example being sultan Selim the Grim ( 1517–1520), whose mother Gülbahar Hatun was a Pontic Greek.
The roots of Greek success in the Ottoman Empire can be traced to the Greek tradition of education and commerce exemplified in the Phanariotes. It was the wealth of the extensive merchant class that provided the material basis for the intellectual revival that was the prominent feature of Greek life in the half century and more leading to the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821. Not coincidentally, on the eve of 1821, the three most important centres of Greek learning were situated in Chios, Smyrna and Aivali, all three major centres of Greek commerce. Greek success was also favoured by Greek domination in the leadership of the Eastern Orthodox church.

===Modern===

The movement of the Greek enlightenment, the Greek expression of the Age of Enlightenment, contributed not only in the promotion of education, culture and printing among the Greeks, but also in the case of independence from the Ottomans, and the restoration of the term &quot;Hellene&quot;. Adamantios Korais, probably the most important intellectual of the movement, advocated the use of the term &quot;Hellene&quot; (Έλληνας) or &quot;Graikos&quot; (Γραικός) in the place of &quot;Romiós&quot;, that was seen negatively by him.

The relationship between ethnic Greek identity and Greek Orthodox religion continued after the creation of the modern Greek nation-state in 1830. According to the second article of the first Greek constitution of 1822, a Greek was defined as any native Christian resident of the Kingdom of Greece, a clause removed by 1840. A century later, when the Treaty of Lausanne was signed between Greece and Turkey in 1923, the two countries agreed to use religion as the determinant for ethnic identity for the purposes of population exchange, although most of the Greeks displaced (over a million of the total 1.5 million) had already been driven out by the time the agreement was signed. The Greek genocide, in particular the harsh removal of Pontian Greeks from the southern shore area of the Black Sea, contemporaneous with and following the failed Greek Asia Minor Campaign, was part of this process of Turkification of the Ottoman Empire and the placement of its economy and trade, then largely in Greek hands under ethnic Turkish control.

==Identity==
The terms used to define Greekness have varied throughout history but were never limited or completely identified with membership to a Greek state. Herodotus gave a famous account of what defined Greek (Hellenic) ethnic identity in his day, enumerating 
#shared descent ()
#shared language ()
#shared sanctuaries and sacrifices ()
#shared customs ().

By Western standards, the term &quot;Greeks&quot; has traditionally referred to any native speakers of the Greek language, whether Mycenaean, Byzantine or modern Greek. Byzantine Greeks self-identified as &quot;Romaioi&quot; (&quot;Romans&quot;), &quot;Graikoi&quot; (&quot;Greeks&quot;) and &quot;Christianoi&quot; (&quot;Christians&quot;) since they were the political heirs of imperial Rome, the descendants of their classical Greek forebears and followers of the Apostles; during the mid-to-late Byzantine period (11th–13th century), a growing number of Byzantine Greek intellectuals deemed themselves &quot;Hellenes&quot; although for most Greek-speakers, &quot;Hellene&quot; still meant pagan. On the eve of the Fall of Constantinople the Last Emperor urged his soldiers to remember that they were the descendants of Greeks and Romans.

Before the establishment of the modern Greek nation-state, the link between ancient and modern Greeks was emphasized by the scholars of Greek Enlightenment especially by Rigas Feraios. In his &quot;Political Constitution&quot;, he addresses to the nation as &quot;the people descendant of the Greeks&quot;. The modern Greek state was created in 1829, when the Greeks liberated a part of their historic homelands, Peloponnese, from the Ottoman Empire. The large Greek diaspora and merchant class were instrumental in transmitting the ideas of western romantic nationalism and philhellenism, which together with the conception of Hellenism, formulated during the last centuries of the Byzantine Empire, formed the basis of the Diafotismos and the current conception of Hellenism.

The Greeks today are a nation in the meaning of an &quot;ethnos&quot;, defined by possessing Greek culture and having a Greek mother tongue, not by citizenship, race, and religion or by being subjects of any particular state. In ancient and medieval times and to some extent today the Greek term was &quot;genos&quot;, which also indicates a common ancestry.

===Names===

Greeks and Greek-speakers have used different names to refer to themselves collectively. The term (Ἀχαιοί) is one of the collective names for the Greeks in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; (the Homeric &quot;long-haired Achaeans&quot; would have been a part of the Mycenaean civilization that dominated Greece from 1600 BC until 1100 BC). The other common names are (Δαναοί) and (Ἀργεῖοι) while (Πανέλληνες) and (Ἕλληνες) both appear only once in the &quot;Iliad&quot;; all of these terms were used, synonymously, to denote a common Greek identity. In the historical period, Herodotus identified the Achaeans of the northern Peloponnese as descendants of the earlier, Homeric Achaeans.

Homer refers to the &quot;Hellenes&quot; () as a relatively small tribe settled in Thessalic Phthia, with its warriors under the command of Achilleus. The Parian Chronicle says that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks (). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of the Hellenes who ruled around Phthia, was the son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, the only survivors after the Great Deluge. The Greek philosopher Aristotle names ancient Hellas as an area in Epirus between Dodona and the Achelous river, the location of the Great Deluge of Deucalion, a land occupied by the Selloi and the &quot;Greeks&quot; who later came to be known as &quot;Hellenes&quot;. In the Homeric tradition, the Selloi were the priests of Dodonian Zeus.

In the Hesiodic &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, Graecus is presented as the son of Zeus and Pandora II, sister of Hellen the patriarch of the Hellenes. According to the Parian Chronicle, when Deucalion became king of Phthia, the (Γραικοί) were named Hellenes. Aristotle notes in his &quot;Meteorologica&quot; that the Hellenes were related to the Graikoi.

====Etymology====
The English names &quot;Greece&quot; and &quot;Greek&quot; are derived, via the Latin &#x27; and &#x27;, from the name of the Graeci (, ; , ), who were among the first ancient Greek tribes to settle southern Italy (the so-called &quot;Magna Graecia&quot;). The term is possibly derived from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;&quot;, &quot;to grow old&quot;, more specifically from Graea (ancient city), said by Aristotle to be the oldest in Greece, and the source of colonists for the Naples area.

===Continuity===
The most obvious link between modern and ancient Greeks is their language, which has a documented tradition from at least the 14th century BC to the present day, albeit with a break during the Greek Dark Ages from which written records are absent (11th- 8th cent. BC, though the Cypriot syllabary was in use during this period). Scholars compare its continuity of tradition to Chinese alone. Since its inception, Hellenism was primarily a matter of common culture and the national continuity of the Greek world is a lot more certain than its demographic. Yet, Hellenism also embodied an ancestral dimension through aspects of Athenian literature that developed and influenced ideas of descent based on autochthony. During the later years of the Eastern Roman Empire, areas such as Ionia and Constantinople experienced a Hellenic revival in language, philosophy, and literature and on classical models of thought and scholarship. This revival provided a powerful impetus to the sense of cultural affinity with ancient Greece and its classical heritage. Throughout their history, the Greeks have retained their language and alphabet, certain values and cultural traditions, customs, a sense of religious and cultural difference and exclusion (the word &quot;barbarian&quot; was used by 12th-century historian Anna Komnene to describe non-Greek speakers), a sense of Greek identity and common sense of ethnicity despite the undeniable socio-political changes of the past two millennia. In recent anthropological studies, both ancient and modern Greek osteological samples were analyzed demonstrating a bio-genetic affinity and continuity shared between both groups. There is also a direct genetic link between ancient Greeks and modern Greeks.

===Demographics===
Today, Greeks are the majority ethnic group in the Hellenic Republic, where they constitute 93% of the country&#x27;s population, and the Republic of Cyprus where they make up 78% of the island&#x27;s population (excluding Turkish settlers in the occupied part of the country). Greek populations have not traditionally exhibited high rates of growth; a large percentage of Greek population growth since Greece&#x27;s foundation in 1832 was attributed to annexation of new territories, as well as the influx of 1.5 million Greek refugees after the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey. About 80% of the population of Greece is urban, with 28% concentrated in the city of Athens.

Greeks from Cyprus have a similar history of emigration, usually to the English-speaking world because of the island&#x27;s colonization by the British Empire. Waves of emigration followed the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, while the population decreased between mid-1974 and 1977 as a result of emigration, war losses, and a temporary decline in fertility. After the ethnic cleansing of a third of the Greek population of the island in 1974, there was also an increase in the number of Greek Cypriots leaving, especially for the Middle East, which contributed to a decrease in population that tapered off in the 1990s. Today more than two-thirds of the Greek population in Cyprus is urban.

Around 1990, most Western estimates of the number of ethnic Greeks in Albania were around 200,000 but in the 1990s, a majority of them migrated to Greece. The Greek minority of Turkey, which numbered upwards of 200,000 people after the 1923 exchange, has now dwindled to a few thousand, after the 1955 Constantinople Pogrom and other state sponsored violence and discrimination. This effectively ended, though not entirely, the three-thousand-year-old presence of Hellenism in Asia Minor. There are smaller Greek minorities in the rest of the Balkan countries, the Levant and the Black Sea states, remnants of the Old Greek Diaspora (pre-19th century).

===Diaspora===

The total number of Greeks living outside Greece and Cyprus today is a contentious issue. Where census figures are available, they show around three million Greeks outside Greece and Cyprus. Estimates provided by the SAE – World Council of Hellenes Abroad put the figure at around seven million worldwide. According to George Prevelakis of Sorbonne University, the number is closer to just below five million. Integration, intermarriage, and loss of the Greek language influence the self-identification of the Greek diaspora (&quot;omogenia&quot;). Important centres include New York City, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, Sydney, Melbourne, London, Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Auckland, and Sao Paulo. In 2010, the Hellenic Parliament introduced a law that allowed members of the diaspora to vote in Greek elections; this law was repealed in early 2014.

====Ancient====

In ancient times, the trading and colonizing activities of the Greek tribes and city states spread the Greek culture, religion and language around the Mediterranean and Black Sea basins, especially in Southern Italy (the so-called &quot;Magna Graecia&quot;), Spain, the south of France and the Black sea coasts. Under Alexander the Great&#x27;s empire and successor states, Greek and Hellenizing ruling classes were established in the Middle East, India and in Egypt. The Hellenistic period is characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization that established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Under the Roman Empire, easier movement of people spread Greeks across the Empire and in the eastern territories, Greek became the lingua franca rather than Latin. The modern-day Griko community of southern Italy, numbering about 60,000, may represent a living remnant of the ancient Greek populations of Italy.

====Modern====

During and after the Greek War of Independence, Greeks of the diaspora were important in establishing the fledgling state, raising funds and awareness abroad. Greek merchant families already had contacts in other countries and during the disturbances many set up home around the Mediterranean (notably Marseilles in France, Livorno in Italy, Alexandria in Egypt), Russia (Odesa and Saint Petersburg), and Britain (London and Liverpool) from where they traded, typically in textiles and grain. Businesses frequently comprised the extended family, and with them they brought schools teaching Greek and the Greek Orthodox Church.

As markets changed and they became more established, some families grew their operations to become shippers, financed through the local Greek community, notably with the aid of the Ralli or Vagliano Brothers. With economic success, the Diaspora expanded further across the Levant, North Africa, India and the USA.

In the 20th century, many Greeks left their traditional homelands for economic reasons resulting in large migrations from Greece and Cyprus to the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, Germany, and South Africa, especially after the Second World War (1939–1945), the Greek Civil War (1946–1949), and the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus in 1974.

While official figures remain scarce, polls and anecdotal evidence point to renewed Greek emigration as a result of the Greek financial crisis. According to data published by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany in 2011, 23,800 Greeks emigrated to Germany, a significant increase over the previous year. By comparison, about 9,000 Greeks emigrated to Germany in 2009 and 12,000 in 2010.

==Culture==

Greek culture has evolved over thousands of years, with its beginning in the Mycenaean civilization, continuing through the classical era, the Hellenistic period, the Roman and Byzantine periods and was profoundly affected by Christianity, which it in turn influenced and shaped. Ottoman Greeks had to endure through several centuries of adversity that culminated in genocide in the 20th century. The Diafotismos is credited with revitalizing Greek culture and giving birth to the synthesis of ancient and medieval elements that characterize it today.

===Language===

Most Greeks speak the Greek language, an independent branch of the Indo-European languages, with its closest relations possibly being Armenian (see Graeco-Armenian) or the Indo-Iranian languages (see Graeco-Aryan). It has the longest documented history of any living language and Greek literature has a continuous history of over 2,500 years. The oldest inscriptions in Greek are in the Linear B script, dated as far back as 1450 BC. Following the Greek Dark Ages, from which written records are absent, the Greek alphabet appears in the 9th–8th century BC. The Greek alphabet derived from the Phoenician alphabet, and in turn became the parent alphabet of the Latin, Cyrillic, and several other alphabets. The earliest Greek literary works are the Homeric epics, variously dated from the 8th to the 6th century BC. Notable scientific and mathematical works include Euclid&#x27;s Elements, Ptolemy&#x27;s Almagest, and others. The New Testament was originally written in Koine Greek.

Greek demonstrates several linguistic features that are shared with other Balkan languages, such as Albanian, Bulgarian and Eastern Romance languages (see Balkan sprachbund), and has absorbed many foreign words, primarily of Western European and Turkish origin. Because of the movements of Philhellenism and the Diafotismos in the 19th century, which emphasized the modern Greeks&#x27; ancient heritage, these foreign influences were excluded from official use via the creation of Katharevousa, a somewhat artificial form of Greek purged of all foreign influence and words, as the official language of the Greek state. In 1976, however, the Hellenic Parliament voted to make the spoken Dimotiki the official language, making Katharevousa obsolete.

Modern Greek has, in addition to Standard Modern Greek or Dimotiki, a wide variety of dialects of varying levels of mutual intelligibility, including Cypriot, Pontic, Cappadocian, Griko and Tsakonian (the only surviving representative of ancient Doric Greek). Yevanic is the language of the Romaniotes, and survives in small communities in Greece, New York and Israel. In addition to Greek, many Greek citizens in Greece and the diaspora are bilingual in other languages such as English, Arvanitika/Albanian, Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, Macedonian Slavic, Russian and Turkish.

===Religion===
Most Greeks are Christians, belonging to the Greek Orthodox Church. During the first centuries after Jesus Christ, the New Testament was originally written in Koine Greek, which remains the liturgical language of the Greek Orthodox Church, and most of the early Christians and Church Fathers were Greek-speaking. There are small groups of ethnic Greeks adhering to other Christian denominations like Latin-rite and Greek Byzantine-rite Roman Catholics, Greek Evangelicals, Pentecostals, Mormons, and groups adhering to other religions including Romaniot and Sephardic Jews, Greek Muslims and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. About 2,000 Greeks are members of Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism congregations.

Greek-speaking Muslims live mainly outside Greece in the contemporary era. There are both Christian and Muslim Greek-speaking communities in Lebanon and Syria, while in the Pontus region of Turkey there is a large community of indeterminate size who were spared from the population exchange because of their religious affiliation.

===Arts===


Greek art has a long and varied history. Greeks have contributed to the visual, literary and performing arts. In the West, classical Greek art was influential in shaping the Roman and later the modern Western artistic heritage. Following the Renaissance in Europe, the humanist aesthetic and the high technical standards of Greek art inspired generations of European artists. Well into the 19th century, the classical tradition derived from Greece played an important role in the art of the Western world. In the East, Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquests initiated several centuries of exchange between Greek, Central Asian and Indian cultures, resulting in Indo-Greek and Greco-Buddhist art, whose influence reached as far as Japan.

Byzantine Greek art, which grew from the Hellenistic classical art and adapted the pagan motifs in the service of Christianity, provided a stimulus to the art of many nations. Its influences can be traced from Venice in the West to Kazakhstan in the East. In turn, Greek art was influenced by eastern civilizations (i.e. Egypt, Persia, etc.) during various periods of its history.

Notable modern Greek artists include: 
*the painters Dominikos Theotokopoulos (El Greco), Nikolaos Gyzis, Konstantinos Volanakis, Périclès Pantazis, and Constantine Andreou; sculptors such as Yannoulis Chalepas; 
*composers such as Mikis Theodorakis, Spyridon Samaras, Iannis Xenakis, Yanni and Vangelis; 
*singers such as Maria Callas, Giorgos Dalaras, Nana Mouskouri, Vicky Leandros and Demis Roussos; 
*poets such as Dionysios Solomos, Angelos Sikelianos, Andreas Embirikos, Constantine P. Cavafy and Nobel laureates Giorgos Seferis and Odysseas Elytis; 
*the novelists Alexandros Papadiamantis, Emmanuel Rhoides, Ion Dragoumis, Nikos Kazantzakis, Penelope Delta, Stratis Myrivilis, Vassilis Vassilikos and Petros Markaris, 
*playwrights include the Cretan Renaissance poets Georgios Chortatzis and Vincenzos Cornaros, and also Gregorios Xenopoulos and Iakovos Kambanellis.
Notable cinema or theatre actors include Marika Kotopouli, Melina Mercouri, Ellie Lambeti, Academy Award winner Katina Paxinou, Alexis Minotis, Dimitris Horn, Thanasis Veggos, Manos Katrakis and Irene Papas. Alekos Sakellarios, Karolos Koun, Vasilis Georgiadis, Kostas Gavras, Michael Cacoyannis, Giannis Dalianidis, Nikos Koundouros and Theo Angelopoulos are among the most important directors.

Among the most significant modern-era architects are Stamatios Kleanthis, Lysandros Kaftanzoglou, Anastasios Metaxas, Panagis Kalkos, Anastasios Orlandos, the naturalized Greek Ernst Ziller, Dimitris Pikionis and urban planners Stamatis Voulgaris and George Candilis.

===Science===
The Greeks of the Classical and Hellenistic eras made seminal contributions to science and philosophy, laying the foundations of several western scientific traditions, such as astronomy, geography, historiography, mathematics, medicine, philosophy and political science. The scholarly tradition of the Greek academies was maintained during Roman times with several academic institutions in Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria and other centers of Greek learning, while Byzantine science was essentially a continuation of classical science. Greeks have a long tradition of valuing and investing in &quot;paideia&quot; (education). &quot;Paideia&quot; was one of the highest societal values in the Greek and Hellenistic world while the first European institution described as a university was founded in 5th century Constantinople and operated in various incarnations until the city&#x27;s fall to the Ottomans in 1453. The University of Constantinople was Christian Europe&#x27;s first secular institution of higher learning since no theological subjects were taught, and considering the original meaning of the word university as a corporation of students, the world&#x27;s first university as well.

As of 2007, Greece had the eighth highest percentage of tertiary enrollment in the world (with the percentages for female students being higher than for male) while Greeks of the Diaspora are equally active in the field of education. Hundreds of thousands of Greek students attend western universities every year while the faculty lists of leading Western universities contain a striking number of Greek names. Notable Greek scientists of modern times include: physician Georgios Papanicolaou (pioneer in cytopathology, inventor of the Pap test); mathematician Constantin Carathéodory (acclaimed contributor to real and complex analysis and the calculus of variations); archaeologists Manolis Andronikos (unearthed the tomb of Philip II), Valerios Stais (recognised the Antikythera mechanism), Spyridon Marinatos (specialised in Mycenaean sites) and Ioannis Svoronos; chemists Leonidas Zervas (of Bergmann-Zervas synthesis and Z-group discovery fame), K. C. Nicolaou (first total synthesis of taxol) and Panayotis Katsoyannis (first chemical synthesis of insulin); computer scientists Michael Dertouzos and Nicholas Negroponte (known for their early work with the World Wide Web), John Argyris (co-creator of the FEM), Joseph Sifakis (2007 Turing Award), Christos Papadimitriou (2002 Knuth Prize) and Mihalis Yannakakis (2005 Knuth Prize); physicist-mathematician Demetrios Christodoulou (renowned for work on Minkowski spacetime) and physicists Achilles Papapetrou (known for solutions of general relativity), Dimitri Nanopoulos (extensive work on particle physics and cosmology), and John Iliopoulos (2007 Dirac Prize for work on the charm quark); astronomer Eugenios Antoniadis; biologist Fotis Kafatos (contributor to cDNA cloning technology); botanist Theodoros Orphanides; economist Xenophon Zolotas (held various senior posts in international organisations such as the IMF); Indologist Dimitrios Galanos; linguist Yiannis Psycharis (promoter of Demotic Greek); historians Constantine Paparrigopoulos (founder of modern Greek historiography) and Helene Glykatzi Ahrweiler (excelled in Byzantine studies); and political scientists Nicos Poulantzas (a leading Structural Marxist) and Cornelius Castoriadis (philosopher of history and ontologist, social critic, economist, psychoanalyst).

Significant engineers and automobile designers include Nikolas Tombazis, Alec Issigonis and Andreas Zapatinas.

===Symbols===


The most widely used symbol is the flag of Greece, which features nine equal horizontal stripes of blue alternating with white representing the nine syllables of the Greek national motto &quot;Eleftheria i Thanatos&quot; (Freedom or Death), which was the motto of the Greek War of Independence. The blue square in the upper hoist-side corner bears a white cross, which represents Greek Orthodoxy. The Greek flag is widely used by the Greek Cypriots, although Cyprus has officially adopted a neutral flag to ease ethnic tensions with the Turkish Cypriot minority (see flag of Cyprus).

The pre-1978 (and first) flag of Greece, which features a Greek cross (&quot;crux immissa quadrata&quot;) on a blue background, is widely used as an alternative to the official flag, and they are often flown together. The national emblem of Greece features a blue escutcheon with a white cross surrounded by two laurel branches. A common design involves the current flag of Greece and the pre-1978 flag of Greece with crossed flagpoles and the national emblem placed in front.

Another highly recognizable and popular Greek symbol is the double-headed eagle, the imperial emblem of the last dynasty of the Eastern Roman Empire and a common symbol in Asia Minor and, later, Eastern Europe. It is not part of the modern Greek flag or coat-of-arms, although it is officially the insignia of the Greek Army and the flag of the Church of Greece. It had been incorporated in the Greek coat of arms between 1925 and 1926.

===Politics===
Classical Athens is considered the birthplace of Democracy. The term appeared in the 5th century BC to denote the political systems then existing in Greek city-states, notably Athens, to mean &quot;rule of the people&quot;, in contrast to aristocracy (, &quot;&quot;), meaning &quot;rule by an excellent elite&quot;, and to oligarchy. While theoretically these definitions are in opposition, in practice the distinction has been blurred historically. Led by Cleisthenes, Athenians established what is generally held as the first democracy in 508–507 BC, which took gradually the form of a direct democracy. The democratic form of government declined during the Hellenistic and Roman eras, only to be revived as an interest in Western Europe during the early modern period.

The European enlightenment and the democratic, liberal and nationalistic ideas of the French Revolution was a crucial factor to the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence and the establishment of the modern Greek state.

Notable modern Greek politicians include Ioannis Kapodistrias, founder of the First Hellenic Republic, reformist Charilaos Trikoupis, Eleftherios Venizelos, who marked the shape of modern Greece, social democrats Georgios Papandreou and Alexandros Papanastasiou, Konstantinos Karamanlis, founder of the Third Hellenic Republic, and socialist Andreas Papandreou.

===Surnames and personal names===
Greek surnames began to appear in the 9th and 10th century, at first among ruling families, eventually supplanting the ancient tradition of using the father&#x27;s name as disambiguator. Nevertheless, Greek surnames are most commonly patronymics, such those ending in the suffix &quot;-opoulos&quot; or &quot;-ides&quot;, while others derive from trade professions, physical characteristics, or a location such as a town, village, or monastery. Commonly, Greek male surnames end in -s, which is the common ending for Greek masculine proper nouns in the nominative case. Occasionally (especially in Cyprus), some surnames end in &quot;-ou&quot;, indicating the genitive case of a patronymic name. Many surnames end in suffixes that are associated with a particular region, such as &quot;-akis&quot; (Crete), &quot;-eas&quot; or &quot;-akos&quot; (Mani Peninsula), &quot;-atos&quot; (island of Cephalonia), &quot;-ellis&quot; (island of Lesbos) and so forth. In addition to a Greek origin, some surnames have Turkish or Latin/Italian origin, especially among Greeks from Asia Minor and the Ionian Islands, respectively. Female surnames end in a vowel and are usually the genitive form of the corresponding males surname, although this usage is not followed in the diaspora, where the male version of the surname is generally used.

With respect to personal names, the two main influences are Christianity and classical Hellenism; ancient Greek nomenclatures were never forgotten but have become more widely bestowed from the 18th century onwards. As in antiquity, children are customarily named after their grandparents, with the first born male child named after the paternal grandfather, the second male child after the maternal grandfather, and similarly for female children. Personal names are often familiarized by a diminutive suffix, such as &quot;-akis&quot; for male names and &quot;-itsa&quot; or &quot;-oula&quot; for female names. Greeks generally do not use middle names, instead using the genitive of the father&#x27;s first name as a middle name. This usage has been passed on to the Russians and other East Slavs (otchestvo).

===Sea: exploring and commerce===

The traditional Greek homelands have been the Greek peninsula and the Aegean Sea, Southern Italy (the so called &quot;Magna Graecia&quot;), the Black Sea, the Ionian coasts of Asia Minor and the islands of Cyprus and Sicily. In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaidon&quot;, Socrates remarks, &quot;we (Greeks) live around a sea like frogs around a pond&quot; when describing to his friends the Greek cities of the Aegean. This image is attested by the map of the Old Greek Diaspora, which corresponded to the Greek world until the creation of the Greek state in 1832. The sea and trade were natural outlets for Greeks since the Greek peninsula is mostly rocky and does not offer good prospects for agriculture.

Notable Greek seafarers include people such as Pytheas of Massalia who sailed to Great Britain, Euthymenes who sailed to Africa, Scylax of Caryanda who sailed to India, the navarch of Alexander the Great Nearchus, Megasthenes, explorer of India, later the 6th century merchant and monk Cosmas Indicopleustes (&quot;Cosmas who sailed to India&quot;), and the explorer of the Northwestern Passage Ioannis Fokas also known as Juan de Fuca. In later times, the Byzantine Greeks plied the sea-lanes of the Mediterranean and controlled trade until an embargo imposed by the Byzantine emperor on trade with the Caliphate opened the door for the later Italian pre-eminence in trade. Panayotis Potagos was another explorer of modern times who was the first to reach Mbomu and Uele River from the north.

The Greek shipping tradition recovered during the late Ottoman rule (especially after the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca and during the Napoleonic Wars), when a substantial merchant middle class developed, which played an important part in the Greek War of Independence. Today, Greek shipping continues to prosper to the extent that Greece has one of the largest merchant fleets in the world, while many more ships under Greek ownership fly flags of convenience. The most notable shipping magnate of the 20th century was Aristotle Onassis, others being Yiannis Latsis, Stavros G. Livanos, and Stavros Niarchos.

==Genetics==

In their archaeogenetic study, Lazaridis et al. (2017) found that Minoans and Mycenaean Greeks were genetically highly similar, but not identical; modern Greeks resembled the Mycenaeans, but with some additional dilution of the early Neolithic ancestry. The results of the study support the idea of genetic continuity between these civilizations and modern Greeks, but not isolation in the history of populations of the Aegean, before and after the time of its earliest civilizations. Furthermore, proposed migrations by Egyptian or Phoenician colonists was not discernible in their data, thus &quot;rejecting the hypothesis that the cultures of the Aegean were seeded by migrants from the old civilizations of these regions.&quot; The F between the sampled Bronze Age populations and present-day West Eurasians was estimated, finding that Mycenaean Greeks and Minoans were least differentiated from the populations of modern Greece, Cyprus, Albania, and Italy. In a subsequent study, Lazaridis et al. (2022) concluded that around ~58.4–65.8% of the ancestry of the Mycenaeans came from Anatolian Neolithic Farmers (ANF), while the remainder mainly came from ancient populations related to the Caucasus Hunter-Gatherers (CHG) (~20.1–22.7%) and the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) culture in the Levant (~7–14%). The Mycenaeans had also inherited ~3.3–5.5% ancestry from a source related to the Eastern European Hunter-Gatherers (EHG), introduced via a proximal source related to the inhabitants of the Eurasian steppe who are hypothesized to be the Proto-Indo-Europeans, and ~0.9–2.3% from the Iron Gates Hunter-Gatherers in the Balkans. Mycenaean elites were genetically the same as Mycenaean commoners in terms of their steppe ancestry, while some Mycenaeans lacked it altogether.

A genetic study by Clemente et al. (2021) found that in the Early Bronze Age, the populations of the Minoan, Helladic, and Cycladic civilizations in the Aegean, were genetically homogeneous. In contrast, the Aegean population during the Middle Bronze Age was more differentiated; probably due to gene flow from a Yamnaya-related population from the Pontic–Caspian steppe. This is corroborated by sequenced genomes of Middle Bronze Age individuals from northern Greece, who had a much higher proportion of steppe-related ancestry; the timing of this gene flow was estimated at ~2,300 BCE, and is consistent with the dominant linguistic theories explaining the emergence of the Proto-Greek language. Present-day Greeks share ~90% of their ancestry with them, suggesting continuity between the two time periods. In the case of Mycenaean Greeks however, their steppe-related ancestry was diluted. The ancestry of the Mycenaeans could be explained via a 2-way admixture model of such MBA individuals in northern Greece, and either an EBA Aegean or MBA Minoan population; the difference between the two time periods could be explained by the general decline of the Mycenaean civilization.

Genetic studies using multiple autosomal, Y-DNA, and mtDNA markers, show that Greeks share similar backgrounds as the rest of the Europeans and especially Southern Europeans (Italians and Balkan populations such as Albanians, Slavic Macedonians and Romanians). A study in 2008 showed that Greeks are genetically closest to Italians and Romanians and another 2008 study showed that they are close to Italians, Albanians, Romanians and southern Balkan Slavs such as Slavic Macedonians and Bulgarians. A 2003 study showed that Greeks cluster with other South European (mainly Italians) and North-European populations and are close to the Basques, and F distances showed that they group with other European and Mediterranean populations, especially with Italians (−0.0001) and Tuscans (0.0005). A study in 2008 showed that Greek regional samples from the mainland cluster with those from the Balkans, principally Albanians while Cretan Greeks cluster with the central Mediterranean and Eastern Mediterranean samples. Studies using mitochondrial DNA gene markers (mtDNA) showed that Greeks group with other Mediterranean European populations and principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed the low genetic distance between Greeks and Italians and also revealed a cline of genes with highest frequencies in the Balkans and Southern Italy, spreading to lowest levels in Britain and the Basque country, which Cavalli-Sforza (1993) associates with &quot;the Greek expansion, which reached its peak in historical times around 1000 and 500 BC but which certainly began earlier&quot;. Greeks also have a degree of Eastern-European-related ancestry which is observed in all Balkan peoples; it was acquired after 700 CE, coinciding with the arrival of Slavic-speaking peoples in the Balkans, but the proportion of this ancestry varies considerably between different studies and subregions. A 2019 study showed that Cretans share high IBD with Western (CEU), Central (German and Polish), Northern (CEU, Scandinavian) and Eastern Europeans (Ukrainian, Russian), similar to mainland Greeks who share high IBD with Eastern Europeans. This reflects settlement patterns in Crete, driven by Myceneans and Dorians, Goths and Slavs. Peoples like Andalusians, Near Eastern Arabs and Venetians left a minimal genetic impact on Cretans. But a PCA analysis shows that Cretans overlap with Peloponneseans, Sicilians and Ashkenazi Jews. A 2022 study discovered high genetic affinities between present-day southeastern Peloponnesian populations and Apulians, Calabrians and southeastern Sicilians, which are &quot;all characterised by a cluster composition different from those displayed by other Greek groups&quot;, due to low influence from inland populations such as Slavic-related people and/or genetic drift in Tsakones and Maniots. Individuals from western Sicily additionally show similarities with peoples from the western part of the Peloponnese. A 2023 study states that early Cretan farmers shared the same ancestry as other Neolithic Aegeans but received &#x27;eastern&#x27; gene flow of Anatolian origin at the end of the Neolithic Age. From the 17th to 12th centuries BCE, genetic signatures of Central and East European ancestry gradually increased in Crete, indicative of mainland Greek influence.

==Physical appearance==
A study from 2013 for prediction of hair and eye colour from DNA of the Greek people showed that the self-reported phenotype frequencies according to hair and eye colour categories was as follows: 119 individuals – hair colour, 11 blond, 45 dark blond/light brown, 49 dark brown, 3 brown red/auburn and 11 had black hair; eye colour, 13 with blue, 15 with intermediate (green, heterochromia) and 91 had brown eye colour.

Another study from 2012 included 150 dental school students from the University of Athens, and the results of the study showed that light hair colour (blonde/light ash brown) was predominant in 10.7% of the students. 36% had medium hair colour (light brown/medium darkest brown), 32% had darkest brown and 21% black (15.3 off black, 6% midnight black). In conclusion, the hair colour of young Greeks are mostly brown, ranging from light to dark brown with significant minorities having black and blonde hair. The same study also showed that the eye colour of the students was 14.6% blue/green, 28% medium (light brown) and 57.4% dark brown.

A 2017 study found that Bronze Age Aegean populations had mostly dark hair (brown to black) and eyes. The genetic phenotype predictions matched the visual representations made by the Greeks of themselves, suggesting that art of this period reproduced phenotypes naturalistically.

==Timeline==
The history of the Greek people is closely associated with the history of Greece, Cyprus, Southern Italy, Constantinople, Asia Minor and the Black Sea. During the Ottoman rule of Greece, a number of Greek enclaves around the Mediterranean were cut off from the core, notably in Southern Italy, the Caucasus, Syria and Egypt. By the early 20th century, over half of the overall Greek-speaking population was settled in Asia Minor (now Turkey), while later that century a huge wave of migration to the United States, Australia, Canada and elsewhere created the modern Greek diaspora.

<text>The Recording Artists&#x27; Coalition (RAC) is an American music industry organization that represents recording artists, and attempts to defend their rights and interests. Compare and contrast with the RIAA, which represents the recording industry. In 2009, it became an element of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. 
Their most vocal and energetic actions have been in support of repealing laws which tie artists to contracts with record labels for seven years, and in successfully lobbying to repeal supposedly &quot;technical revisions&quot; to American copyright statutes which shifted ownership of some copyrights from artists to record labels.

<doc id="42058" wikidata="Q2743922" url="?curid=42058" title="Unknown God">
<text>The Unknown God or Agnostos Theos () is a theory by Eduard Norden first published in 1913 that proposes, based on the Christian Apostle Paul&#x27;s Areopagus speech in Acts 17:23, that in addition to the twelve main gods and the innumerable lesser deities, ancient Greeks worshipped a deity they called &quot;Agnostos Theos&quot;; that is: &quot;Unknown God&quot;, which Norden called &quot;Un-Greek&quot;. In Athens, there was a temple specifically dedicated to that god and very often Athenians would swear &quot;in the name of the Unknown God&quot; (, ). Apollodorus, Philostratus and Pausanias wrote about the Unknown God as well.

== Paul at Athens ==

According to the book of Acts, contained in the Christian New Testament, when the Apostle Paul visited Athens, he saw an altar with an inscription dedicated to that god (possibly connected to the Cylonian affair), and, when invited to speak to the Athenian elite at the Areopagus, gave the following speech:

Because Paul&#x27;s God could not be named, according to the customs of his people, it is possible that Paul&#x27;s Athenian listeners would have considered his God to be &quot;the unknown god par excellence&quot;. His listeners may also have understood the introduction of a new god by allusions to Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;The Eumenides&quot;; the irony would have been that just as the Eumenides were not new gods at all but the Furies in a new form, so was the Christian God not a new god but rather the god the Greeks already worshipped as the Unknown God. His audience would also have recognized the quotes in verse 28 as coming from Epimenides and Aratus, respectively.

== Archaeology ==
There is an altar dedicated to the Unknown God found in 1820 on the Palatine Hill of Rome.
It contains an inscription in Latin that says:

This could be translated into English as: &quot;Whether sacred to god or to goddess, Gaius Sextius Calvinus, son of Gaius, praetor, restored this on a vote of the senate.&quot;

The altar is currently exhibited in the Palatine Museum.

== In Ancient Egypt ==
The idea of an unknown god, however, seems to predate the Greeks. For in Ancient Egypt, Amun was an unknowable god, not only in the sense of his name being unknown, but also his identity or essence.

== In Neoplatonism ==
For Plotinus, the first principle of reality is &quot;the One&quot;, an utterly simple, ineffable, unknowable subsistence which is both the creative source of the Universe and the teleological end of all existing things.

<doc id="42064" wikidata="Q1896863" url="?curid=42064" title="Oneida Community">
<text>The Oneida Community ( ) was a perfectionist religious communal society founded by John Humphrey Noyes and his followers in 1848 near Oneida, New York. The community believed that Jesus had already returned in AD 70, making it possible for them to bring about Jesus&#x27;s millennial kingdom themselves, and be perfect and free of sin in this world, not just in Heaven (a belief called &quot;perfectionism&quot;). The Oneida Community practiced communalism (in the sense of communal property and possessions), group marriage, male sexual continence, Oneida stirpiculture (a form of eugenics), and mutual criticism.

The community&#x27;s original 87 members grew to 172 by February 1850, 208 by 1852, and 306 by 1878. There were smaller Noyesian communities in Wallingford, Connecticut; Newark, New Jersey; Putney and Cambridge, Vermont. The branches were closed in 1854 except for the Wallingford branch, which operated until the 1878 tornado devastated it.

The Oneida Community dissolved in 1881, converting itself to a joint-stock company. This eventually became the silverware company Oneida Limited, one of the largest in the world.

== Structure ==

Even though the community only reached a maximum population of about 300, it had a complex bureaucracy of 27 standing committees and 48 administrative sections.

All community members were expected to work, each according to their abilities. Women tended to do many of the domestic duties. Although more skilled jobs tended to remain with an individual member (the financial manager, for example, held his post throughout the life of the community), community members rotated through the more unskilled jobs, working in the house, the fields, or the various industries. As Oneida thrived, it also began to hire outsiders to work in these positions. They were a major employer in the area, with approximately 200 employees by 1870.

Secondary industries included manufacturing leather travel bags, weaving palm frond hats, construction of rustic garden furniture, game traps, and tourism. Silverware manufacturing began in 1877, relatively late in the community&#x27;s life, and still exists.

=== Complex marriage ===

The Oneida community strongly believed in a system of free love – a term which Noyes is credited with coining – which was known as complex marriage, where any member was free to have sex with any other who consented. Possessiveness and exclusive relationships were frowned upon.

Noyes developed a distinction between amative and propagative love.

Women over 40 were to act as sexual &quot;mentors&quot; to adolescent boys because these relationships had a minimal chance of conceiving. Furthermore, these women became religious role models for the young men. Likewise, older men often introduced young women to sex. Noyes often used his judgment in determining the partnerships that would form, and he would often encourage relationships between the non-devout and the devout in the community in the hope that the attitudes and behaviors of the devout would influence the attitudes of the non-devout.

In 1993, the community archives were made available to scholars for the first time. Contained within the archives was the journal of Tirzah Miller, Noyes&#x27; niece, who wrote extensively about her romantic and sexual relations with other members of Oneida.

=== Mutual criticism ===

Every member of the community was subject to criticism by a committee or the community as a whole during a general meeting. The goal was to eliminate undesirable character traits. Various contemporary sources contend that Noyes himself was the subject of criticism, although less often and of probably less severe criticism than the rest of the community. Charles Nordhoff said he had witnessed the criticism of a member he referred to as &quot;Charles&quot;, writing the following account of the incident:

=== Male continence ===

The Oneida community enacted a system of male continence or &quot;coitus reservatus&quot; to control reproduction within it. John Humphrey Noyes decided that sexual intercourse served two distinct purposes. In &quot;Male Continence&quot;, Noyes argues that the method simply &quot;proposes the subordination of the flesh to the spirit, teaching men to seek principally the elevated spiritual pleasures of sexual connection&quot;. The primary purpose of male continence was social satisfaction, &quot;to allow the sexes to communicate and express affection for one another&quot;. The second purpose was procreation. Of around two hundred adults using male continence as birth control, there were twelve unplanned births within Oneida between 1848 and 1868, indicating that it was a highly effective form of birth control. Young men were introduced to male continence by post-menopausal women, and experienced, older males introduced young women.

Noyes believed that ejaculation &quot;drained men&#x27;s vitality and led to disease&quot; and pregnancy and childbirth &quot;levied a heavy tax on the vitality of women&quot;. Noyes founded male continence to spare his wife, Harriet, from more difficult childbirths after five traumatizing births of which four led to the death of the child. They favored this method of male continence over other methods of birth control because they found it to be natural, healthy, and favorable for the development of intimate relationships. Women found increased sexual satisfaction in the practice, and Oneida is regarded as highly unusual in the value they placed on women&#x27;s sexual satisfaction. If a male failed, he faced public disapproval or private rejection.

It is unclear whether the practice of male continence led to significant problems. Sociologist Lawrence Foster sees hints in Noyes&#x27; letters indicating that masturbation and anti-social withdrawal from community life may have been issues. Oneida&#x27;s practice of male continence did not lead to impotence.

=== Stirpiculture ===
Stirpiculture was a proto-eugenics program of selective controlled reproduction within the community devised by Noyes and implemented in 1869. It was designed to create more spiritually and physically perfect children. Community members who wished to be parents would go before a committee to be approved and matched based on their spiritual and moral qualities. 53 women and 38 men participated in this program, which necessitated the construction of a new wing of the Oneida Community Mansion House. The experiment yielded 58 children, nine of whom were fathered by Noyes.

Once children were weaned (usually at around the age of one), they were raised communally in the Children&#x27;s Wing, or South Wing. Their parents were allowed to visit, but the children&#x27;s department held jurisdiction over raising the offspring. If the department suspected a parent and child were bonding too closely, the community would enforce a period of separation because the group wanted to stop the affection between parents and children. The Children&#x27;s department had a male and female supervisor to look after children between ages two and twelve. The supervisors made sure the children followed the routine. Dressing, prayers, breakfast, work, school, lunch, work, playtime, supper, prayers, and study, which were &quot;adjusted according to &#x27;age and ability&#x27;.&quot;

Stirpiculture was the first positive eugenics experiment in the United States, although it was not recognized as such because of the religious framework from which it emerged.

=== Role of women ===

Oneida embodied one of the most radical and institutional efforts to change women&#x27;s roles and improve female status in 19th-century America. Women gained some freedoms in the commune that they could not get on the outside. Some of these privileges included not having to care for their own children as Oneida had a communal child care system and freedom from unwanted pregnancies with Oneida&#x27;s male continence practice. In addition, they were able to wear functional, Bloomer-style clothing and maintain short haircuts. Women were able to participate in practically all types of community work. While domestic duties remained a primarily female responsibility, women were free to explore positions in business and sales, or as artisans or craftspersons, and many did so, particularly in the late 1860s and early 1870s. Last, women actively shaped commune policy, participating in the daily religious and business meetings.

The complex marriage and free love systems practiced at Oneida further acknowledged female status. Through the complex marriage arrangement, women and men had equal freedom in sexual expression and commitment. Indeed, sexual practices at Oneida accepted female sexuality. A woman&#x27;s right to satisfying sexual experiences was recognized, and women were encouraged to have orgasms. However, a woman&#x27;s right to refuse a sexual overture was limited depending on the status of the man who made the advance.

Ellen Wayland-Smith, the author of &quot;The Status and Self-Perception of Women in the Oneida Community&quot;, said that men and women had roughly equal status in the community. She points out that while both sexes were ultimately subject to Noyes&#x27; vision and will, women did not suffer undue oppression.

== Interactions with society ==

The community experienced freedom from wider society. The previously mentioned unorthodox marital, sexual, and religious practices caused them to face some criticism. However, between the community&#x27;s beginning in the 1850s until the 1870s, their interactions with broader society were mostly favorable. These are the best-known instances of conflict and peace resolution.

=== Outside criticism ===

In 1870, a &quot;nineteenth century cultural critic&quot; Dr. John B. Ellis wrote a book against Free Love communities that Noyes inspired, including &quot;Individual Sovereigns, Berlin Heights Free Lovers, Spiritualists, Advocates of Woman Suffrage, or Friends of Free Divorce&quot;. He saw their joint goal to be ending marriage. Dr. Ellis described this as an attack on the prevailing moral order. Historian Gayle Fischer mentions that Dr. Ellis also criticized Oneida women&#x27;s clothing as &quot;healthful&#x27; uniforms did not rid Oneida women of their &#x27;peculiar air of unhealthiness&#x27; — brought on by &quot;sexual excess.&quot;

Noyes responded to Ellis&#x27; criticism four years later in a pamphlet, &quot;Dixon and His Copytists&quot;, where he claimed that Dr. John B. Ellis is a pseudonym for a &quot;literary gentleman living in the upper part of the city.&quot; Noyes argued that AMS press employed the writer after they read a Philadelphia paper article on the community and saw a chance to profit off sensationalist writing.

=== Tryphena Hubbard&#x27;s legal battle ===
In Anthony Wonderly&#x27;s &quot;Oneida Utopia&quot;, he covers the 1848–1851 Hubbard affair as a moment where a legal conflict almost ended the group, which was only a mere &quot;Association&quot; at the time. Twenty-one-year-old Tryphena Hubbard learned Noyes&#x27; ideas about marriage and sex through his manuscript &quot;Bible Argument&quot; in 1848. She joined the community and became the group&#x27;s first local convert. Tryphena Hubbard soon married Henry Seymour, a young man in the community.

Early in 1849, Tryphena&#x27;s father, Noahdiah Hubbard, learned of the Association&#x27;s open marriages and demanded his daughter&#x27;s return. Tryphena refused, and for two years, Noahdiah &quot;made a sulking nuisance of himself at the Mansion House.&quot;

An 1850 criticism of Tryphena mentioned her &quot;insubordination to the church&quot; and &quot;excess egotism amounting to insanity.&quot; There was marriage before the community attempted perfectionism, and Tryphena&#x27;s husband&#x27;s supervision over her was increased along with the &quot;disciplinary norms of the day, physical punishment.&quot;

In September 1851, Tryphena began displaying signs of mental illness, &quot;crying at night, speaking incoherently, and wandering around.&quot; Seymour went to the Hubbard family to report their daughter&#x27;s insanity, and both parents were appalled by Seymour&#x27;s physical violence.

On September 27, 1851, Noahdiah Hubbard lodged assault and battery charges on behalf of his daughter. Seymour was indicted, and other community members were served arrest warrants as accessories.

The case was settled on November 26, 1851. The community agreed to Tryphena&#x27;s expenses while she was in the asylum and after her release $125 a year if she was well and $200 a year if she remained unwell. The Hubbards eventually accepted a $350 settlement in lieu of long-term payments. Tryphena Hubbard eventually returned to Henry Seymour and had a child by him. She died at the age of 49 in 1877.

== Decline ==

The community lasted until John Humphrey Noyes attempted to pass leadership to his son, Theodore Noyes. This move was unsuccessful because Theodore was an agnostic and lacked his father&#x27;s talent for leadership. The move also divided the community, as Communitarian James W. Towner attempted to wrest control for himself. Towner and a breakaway group eventually moved to California, where they convinced the government to create a new municipality for them, Orange County.

Within the commune, there was a debate about when children should be initiated into sex and by whom. There was also much debate about its practices as a whole. The founding members were aging or deceased, and many younger communitarians desired to enter into exclusive, traditional marriages.

The capstone to all these pressures was the campaign by Professor John Mears of Hamilton College against the community. He called for a protest meeting against the Oneida Community, attended by forty-seven clergy members. John Humphrey Noyes was informed by trusted adviser Myron Kinsley that a warrant for his arrest on charges of statutory rape was imminent. Noyes fled the Oneida Community Mansion House and the country in the middle of a June night in 1879, never to return to the United States. Shortly afterward, he wrote to his followers from Niagara Falls, Ontario, recommending that complex marriage be abandoned.

Complex marriage was abandoned in 1879 following external pressures, and the community soon broke apart, with some of the members reorganizing as a joint-stock company. Marital partners normalized their status with the partners with whom they were cohabiting at the time of the re-organization. Over 70 Community members entered into a traditional marriage in the following year.

During the early 20th century, the new company, Oneida Community Limited, narrowed its focus to silverware. The animal trap business was sold in 1912, the silk business in 1916, and the canning was discontinued as unprofitable in 1915.

In 1947, embarrassed by their progenitor&#x27;s legacy, Noyes&#x27; descendants burned the group&#x27;s records.

The joint-stock corporation still exists and is a major producer of cutlery under the brand name &quot;Oneida Limited&quot;. In September 2004, Oneida Limited announced that it would cease all U.S. manufacturing operations at the beginning of 2005, ending a 124-year tradition. The company continues to design and market products that are manufactured overseas. The company has been selling off its manufacturing facilities. Most recently, the distribution center in Sherrill, New York, was closed. Administrative offices remain in the Oneida area.

The last original member of the community, Ella Florence Underwood (1850–1950), died on June 25, 1950, in Kenwood, New York, near Oneida, New York.

== Legacy ==

Many histories and first-person accounts of the Oneida Community have been published since the commune dissolved itself. Among those are: &quot;The Oneida Community: An Autobiography, 1851–1876&quot; and &quot;The Oneida Community: The Breakup, 1876–1881&quot;, both by Constance Noyes Robertson; &quot;Desire and Duty at Oneida: Tirzah Miller&#x27;s Intimate Memoir&quot; and &quot;Special Love/Special Sex: An Oneida Community Diary&quot;, both by Robert S. Fogarty; &quot;Without Sin&quot; by Spencer Klaw; &quot;Oneida, From Free Love Utopia to the Well-Set Table&quot; by Ellen Wayland-Smith; and biographical/autobiographic accounts by once-members including Jessie Catherine Kinsley, Corinna Ackley Noyes, George Wallingford Noyes, and Pierrepont B. Noyes.

An account of the Oneida Community is found in Sarah Vowell&#x27;s book &quot;Assassination Vacation&quot;. It discusses the community in general and the membership of Charles J. Guiteau, for more than five years, in the community. (Guiteau later assassinated President James A. Garfield.) The perfectionist community in David Flusfeder&#x27;s novel &quot;Pagan House&quot; (2007) is directly inspired by the Oneida Community. There is a residential building called &quot;Oneida&quot; at the Twin Oaks Community in Virginia. Twin Oaks, an intentional community, names its buildings after defunct intentional communities.

===Oneida Community Mansion House===

The Oneida Community Mansion House was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1965, and the principal surviving material culture of the Oneida Community consists of those landmarked buildings, object collections, and landscape. The five buildings of the Mansion House, separately designed by Erastus Hamilton, Lewis W. Leeds, and Theodore Skinner, comprise on a 33-acre site. This site has been continuously occupied since the community&#x27;s establishment in 1848, and the existing Mansion House has been inhabited since 1862. Today, the Oneida Community Mansion House is a non-profit educational organization chartered by the State of New York. It welcomes visitors throughout the year with guided tours, programs, and exhibits. It preserves, collects, and interprets the intangible and material culture of the Oneida Community and related themes of the 19th and 20th centuries. The Mansion House also houses residential apartments, overnight guest rooms, and meeting spaces.

<doc id="42068" wikidata="Q15869" url="?curid=42068" title="Freddie Mercury">
<text>Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 – 24 November 1991) was a British singer and songwriter who achieved global fame as the lead vocalist and pianist of the rock band Queen. Regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music, he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal range. Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman with his theatrical style, influencing the artistic direction of Queen.

Born in 1946 in Zanzibar to Parsi-Indian parents, Mercury attended British boarding schools in India from the age of eight and returned to Zanzibar after secondary school. In 1964, his family fled the Zanzibar Revolution, moving to Middlesex, England. Having previously studied and written music, he formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including &quot;Killer Queen&quot;, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;, &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot; and &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot;. His charismatic stage performances often saw him interact with the audience, as displayed at the 1985 Live Aid concert. He also led a solo career and was a producer and guest musician for other artists.

Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987. He continued to record with Queen, and was posthumously featured on their final album, &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; (1995). In 1991, the day after publicly announcing his diagnosis, he died from complications of the disease at the age of 45. In 1992, a concert in tribute to him was held at Wembley Stadium, in benefit of AIDS awareness.

As a member of Queen, Mercury was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. In 1990, he and the other Queen members received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. One year after his death, Mercury received the same award individually. In 2005, Queen were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors. In 2002, Mercury was voted number 58 in the BBC&#x27;s poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.

==Early life==
===Zanzibar and India===
Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsara in Stone Town in the British protectorate of Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania) on 5 September 1946. His parents, Bomi and Jer Bulsara, were from the Parsi community of western India. The Bulsaras had origins in the city of Bulsar (now Valsad) in Gujarat. He had a younger sister, Kashmira (b. 1952).

The family had moved to Zanzibar so that Bomi could continue his job as a cashier at the British Colonial Office. As Parsis, the Bulsaras practised Zoroastrianism. Mercury was born with four extra incisors, to which he attributed his enhanced vocal range. As Zanzibar was a British protectorate until 1963, Mercury was born a British subject, and on 2 June 1969 was registered a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies after the family had emigrated to England.
Mercury spent most of his childhood in India where he began taking piano lessons at the age of seven while living with relatives. In 1954, at the age of eight, Mercury was sent to study at St. Peter&#x27;s School, a British-style boarding school for boys, in Panchgani near Bombay.
Inheriting his father&#x27;s interest in philately, between 9 and 12 years old Mercury collected stamps, many of which were from the British Commonwealth. One of the rare personal possessions of Mercury in museum ownership, his stamp album is displayed in the collection of the Postal Museum in London. At the age of 12, he formed a school band, the Hectics, and covered rock and roll artists such as Cliff Richard and Little Richard. One of Mercury&#x27;s former bandmates from the Hectics has said &quot;the only music he listened to, and played, was Western pop music&quot;. A friend recalls that he had &quot;an uncanny ability to listen to the radio and replay what he heard on piano&quot;. It was also at St. Peter&#x27;s where he began to call himself &quot;Freddie&quot;. In February 1963, he moved back to Zanzibar where he joined his parents at their flat.
===Fleeing to England===
In the spring of 1964, Mercury and his family fled to England from Zanzibar to escape the violence of the revolution against the Sultan of Zanzibar and his mainly Arab government, in which thousands of ethnic Arabs and Indians were killed. They moved to 19 Hamilton Close, Feltham, Middlesex, a town west of central London. The Bulsaras briefly relocated to 122 Hamilton Road, before settling into a small house at 22 Gladstone Avenue in late October. After first studying art at Isleworth Polytechnic in West London, Mercury studied graphic art and design at Ealing Art College, graduating with a diploma in 1969. He later used these skills to design heraldic arms for his band Queen.

Following graduation, Mercury joined a series of bands and sold second-hand Edwardian clothes and scarves in Kensington Market in London with Roger Taylor. Taylor recalls, &quot;Back then, I didn&#x27;t really know him as a singer—he was just my mate. My crazy mate! If there was fun to be had, Freddie and I were usually involved.&quot; He also held a job as a baggage handler at Heathrow Airport. Other friends from the time remember him as a quiet and shy young man with a great interest in music. In 1969, he joined Liverpool-based band Ibex, later renamed Wreckage, which played &quot;very Hendrix-style, heavy blues&quot;. He briefly lived in a flat above the Dovedale Towers, a pub on Penny Lane in Liverpool&#x27;s Mossley Hill district. When this band failed to take off, he joined an Oxford-based band, Sour Milk Sea, but by early 1970 this group had broken up as well.

In April 1970, Mercury teamed up with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor, to become lead singer of their band Smile. They were joined by bassist John Deacon in 1971. Despite the reservations of the other members and Trident Studios, the band&#x27;s initial management, Mercury chose the name &quot;Queen&quot; for the new band. He later said, &quot;It&#x27;s very regal obviously, and it sounds splendid. It&#x27;s a strong name, very universal and immediate. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it.&quot; At about the same time, he legally changed his surname, Bulsara, to Mercury.

Shortly before the release of Queen&#x27;s self-titled first album, Mercury designed the band&#x27;s logo, known as the &quot;Queen crest&quot;. The logo combines the zodiac signs of the four band members: two lions for Deacon and Taylor (sign Leo), a crab for May (Cancer), and two fairies for Mercury (Virgo). The lions embrace a stylised letter Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion. A crown is shown inside the Q, and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous phoenix. The Queen crest bears a passing resemblance to the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, particularly with the lion supporters.

==Artistry==
===Vocals===
Although Mercury&#x27;s speaking voice naturally fell in the baritone range, he delivered most songs in the tenor range. His known vocal range extended from bass low F (F) to soprano high F (F). He could belt up to tenor high F (F). Biographer David Bret described his voice as &quot;escalating within a few bars from a deep, throaty rock-growl to tender, vibrant tenor, then on to a high-pitched, perfect coloratura, pure and crystalline in the upper reaches&quot;. Spanish soprano Montserrat Caballé, with whom Mercury recorded an album, expressed her opinion that &quot;the difference between Freddie and almost all the other rock stars was that he was selling the voice&quot;. She adds:

His technique was astonishing. No problem of tempo, he sang with an incisive sense of rhythm, his vocal placement was very good and he was able to glide effortlessly from a register to another. He also had a great musicality. His phrasing was subtle, delicate and sweet or energetic and slamming. He was able to find the right colouring or expressive nuance for each word.

The Who lead singer Roger Daltrey described Mercury as &quot;the best virtuoso rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll singer of all time. He could sing anything in any style. He could change his style from line to line and, God, that&#x27;s an art. And he was brilliant at it.&quot; Discussing what type of person he wanted to play the lead role in his musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, Andrew Lloyd Webber said: &quot;He has to be of enormous charisma, but he also has to be a genuine, genuine rock tenor. That&#x27;s what it is. Really think Freddie Mercury, I mean that&#x27;s the kind of range we&#x27;re talking about.&quot;

A research team undertook a study in 2016 to understand the appeal behind Mercury&#x27;s voice. Led by Professor Christian Herbst, the team identified his notably faster vibrato and use of subharmonics as unique characteristics of Mercury&#x27;s voice, particularly in comparison to opera singers. The research team studied vocal samples from 23 commercially available Queen recordings, his solo work, and a series of interviews of the late artist. They also used an endoscopic video camera to study a rock singer brought in to imitate Mercury&#x27;s singing voice.

===Songwriting===
Mercury wrote 10 of the 17 songs on Queen&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album: &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot;, &quot;Killer Queen&quot;, &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;, &quot;Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy&quot;, &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;, &quot;Bicycle Race&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot;, &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot;, and &quot;Play the Game&quot;. In 2003 Mercury was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame with the rest of Queen, and in 2005 all four band members were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.

The most notable aspect of his songwriting involved the wide range of genres that he used, which included, among other styles, rockabilly, progressive rock, heavy metal, gospel, and disco. As he explained in a 1986 interview, &quot;I hate doing the same thing again and again and again. I like to see what&#x27;s happening now in music, film and theatre and incorporate all of those things.&quot; Compared to many popular songwriters, Mercury also tended to write musically complex material. For example, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; is non-cyclical in structure and comprises dozens of chords. He also wrote six songs from &quot;Queen II&quot; which deal with multiple key changes and complex material. &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot;, on the other hand, contains only a few chords. Although Mercury often wrote very intricate harmonies, he said that he could barely read music. He composed most of his songs on the piano and used a wide variety of key signatures.

===Live performer===
Mercury was noted for his live performances, which were often delivered to stadium audiences around the world. He displayed a highly theatrical style that often evoked a great deal of participation from the crowd. A writer for &quot;The Spectator&quot; described him as &quot;a performer out to tease, shock and ultimately charm his audience with various extravagant versions of himself.&quot; David Bowie, who performed at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recorded the song &quot;Under Pressure&quot; with Queen, praised Mercury&#x27;s performance style, saying: &quot;Of all the more theatrical rock performers, Freddie took it further than the rest ... he took it over the edge. And of course, I always admired a man who wears tights. I only saw him in concert once and as they say, he was definitely a man who could hold an audience in the palm of his hand.&quot; Queen guitarist Brian May wrote that Mercury could make &quot;the last person at the back of the furthest stand in a stadium feel that he was connected&quot;. Mercury&#x27;s main prop on stage was a broken microphone stand; after accidentally snapping it off the heavy base during an early performance, he realised it could be used in endless ways.

One of Mercury&#x27;s most notable performances with Queen took place at Live Aid in 1985. Queen&#x27;s performance at the event has since been voted by a group of music executives as the greatest live performance in the history of rock music. The results were aired on a television program called &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Gigs&quot;. Mercury&#x27;s powerful, sustained note during the a cappella section came to be known as &quot;The Note Heard Round the World&quot;. In reviewing Live Aid in 2005, one critic wrote, &quot;Those who compile lists of Great Rock Frontmen and award the top spots to Mick Jagger, Robert Plant, etc. all are guilty of a terrible oversight. Freddie, as evidenced by his Dionysian Live Aid performance, was easily the most godlike of them all.&quot; Photographer Denis O&#x27;Regan, who captured a definitive pose of Mercury on stage—arched back, knee bent and facing toward the sky—during his final tour with Queen in 1986, commented &quot;Freddie was a once-in-a-lifetime showman&quot;. Queen roadie Peter Hince states, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t just about his voice but the way he commanded the stage. For him it was all about interacting with the audience and knowing how to get them on his side. And he gave everything in every show.&quot;

Throughout his career, Mercury performed an estimated 700 concerts in countries around the world with Queen. A notable aspect of Queen concerts was the large scale involved. He once explained, &quot;We&#x27;re the Cecil B. DeMille of rock and roll, always wanting to do things bigger and better.&quot; The band was the first ever to play in South American stadiums, breaking worldwide records for concert attendance in the Morumbi Stadium in São Paulo in 1981. In 1986, Queen also played behind the Iron Curtain when they performed to a crowd of 80,000 in Budapest, in what was one of the biggest rock concerts ever held in Eastern Europe. Mercury&#x27;s final live performance with Queen took place on 9 August 1986 at Knebworth Park in England and drew an attendance estimated as high as 200,000. A week prior to Knebworth, May recalled Mercury saying &quot;I&#x27;m not going to be doing this forever. This is probably the last time.&quot; With the British national anthem &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; playing at the end of the concert, Mercury&#x27;s final act on stage saw him draped in a robe, holding a golden crown aloft, bidding farewell to the crowd.

===Instrumentalist===
As a young boy in India, Mercury received formal piano training up to the age of nine. Later on, while living in London, he learned guitar. Much of the music he liked was guitar-oriented: his favourite artists at the time were the Who, the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, and Led Zeppelin. He was often self-deprecating about his skills on both instruments. Brian May said that Mercury &quot;had a wonderful touch on the piano. He could play what came from inside him like nobody else – incredible rhythm, incredible passion and feeling.&quot; Keyboardist Rick Wakeman praised Mercury&#x27;s playing style, saying he &quot;discovered [the piano] for himself&quot; and successfully composed a number of Queen songs on the instrument. From the early 1980s Mercury began extensively using guest keyboardists. Most notably, he enlisted Fred Mandel (a Canadian musician who also worked for Pink Floyd, Elton John, and Supertramp) for his first solo project. From 1982 Mercury collaborated with Morgan Fisher (who performed with Queen in concert during the Hot Space leg), and from 1985 onward Mercury collaborated with Mike Moran (in the studio) and Spike Edney (in concert).

Mercury played the piano in many of Queen&#x27;s most popular songs, including &quot;Killer Queen&quot;, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, &quot;Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy&quot;, &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;, &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot;. He used concert grand pianos (such as a Bechstein) and, occasionally, other keyboard instruments such as the harpsichord. From 1980 onward, he also made frequent use of synthesisers in the studio. Brian May said that Mercury used the piano less over time because he wanted to walk around on stage and entertain the audience. Although he wrote many lines for the guitar, Mercury possessed only rudimentary skills on the instrument. Songs like &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; and &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; were composed on the guitar; the latter featured Mercury playing rhythm guitar on stage and in the studio.

===Solo career===
As well as his work with Queen, Mercury put out two solo albums and several singles. Although his solo work was not as commercially successful as most Queen albums, the two off-Queen albums and several of the singles debuted in the top 10 of the UK Music Charts. His first solo effort goes back to 1972 under the pseudonym Larry Lurex, when Trident Studios&#x27; house engineer Robin Geoffrey Cable was working in a musical project, at the time when Queen were recording their debut album; Cable enlisted Mercury to perform lead vocals on the songs &quot;I Can Hear Music&quot; and &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot;, both were released together as a single in 1973. Eleven years later, Mercury contributed to the soundtrack for the restoration of the 1927 Fritz Lang film &quot;Metropolis&quot;. The song &quot;Love Kills&quot; was written for the film by Giorgio Moroder in collaboration with Mercury, and produced by Moroder and Mack; in 1984 it debuted at the number 10 position in the UK Singles Chart.

Mercury&#x27;s two full albums outside the band were &quot;Mr. Bad Guy&quot; (1985) and &quot;Barcelona&quot; (1988). His first album, &quot;Mr. Bad Guy&quot;, debuted in the top ten of the UK Album Charts. In 1993, a remix of &quot;Living on My Own&quot;, a single from the album, posthumously reached number one on the UK Singles Charts. The song also garnered Mercury a posthumous Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. AllMusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia describes &quot;Mr. Bad Guy&quot; as &quot;outstanding from start to finish&quot; and expressed his view that Mercury &quot;did a commendable job of stretching into uncharted territory&quot;.

His second album, &quot;Barcelona&quot;, recorded with Spanish soprano vocalist Montserrat Caballé, combines elements of popular music and opera. Many critics were uncertain what to make of the album; one referred to it as &quot;the most bizarre CD of the year&quot;. The album was a commercial success, and the album&#x27;s title track debuted at No. 8 in the UK and was also a hit in Spain. The title track received massive airplay as the official anthem of the 1992 Summer Olympics (held in Barcelona one year after Mercury&#x27;s death). Caballé sang it live at the opening of the Olympics with Mercury&#x27;s part played on a screen, and again before the start of the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final between Manchester United and Bayern Munich in Barcelona.

In addition to the two solo albums, Mercury released several singles, including his own version of the hit &quot;The Great Pretender&quot; by the Platters, which debuted at No. 5 in the UK in 1987. In September 2006 a compilation album featuring Mercury&#x27;s solo work was released in the UK in honour of what would have been his 60th birthday. The album debuted in the UK top 10. In 2012, &quot;Freddie Mercury: The Great Pretender&quot;, a documentary film directed by Rhys Thomas on Mercury&#x27;s attempts to forge a solo career, premiered on BBC One.

In 1986, Mercury recorded two songs for Dave Clark&#x27;s West End sci-fi musical &quot;Time&quot;. Mercury performed the title song and Clark played it to Laurence Olivier who starred as the hologram Akash in a pre-filmed segment for the musical in what was one of his last roles, with Clark recalling: &quot;Laurence Olivier was a huge god of an actor. He narrated the album [Time], and, when Freddie came on, singing &quot;Time&quot;, Olivier said, &#x27;Now, my dear boy, &quot;there&#x27;s&quot; an actor.&#x27;&quot; Clark relayed the reaction of Olivier to Mercury: &quot;I told Freddie and he was over the moon. I arranged for a dinner party at my place, Olivier came along and they got on like a house on fire.&quot;

Between 1981 and 1983 Mercury recorded several tracks with Michael Jackson, including a demo of &quot;State of Shock&quot;, &quot;Victory&quot;, and &quot;There Must Be More to Life Than This&quot;. None of these collaborations were officially released at the time, although bootleg recordings exist. Jackson went on to record the single &quot;State of Shock&quot; with Mick Jagger for the Jacksons&#x27; album &quot;Victory&quot;. Mercury included the solo version of &quot;There Must Be More to Life Than This&quot; on his &quot;Mr. Bad Guy&quot; album. &quot;There Must Be More to Life Than This&quot; was eventually reworked by Queen and released on their compilation album &quot;Queen Forever&quot; in 2014. Mercury and Roger Taylor sang on the title track for Billy Squier&#x27;s 1982 studio release, &quot;Emotions in Motion&quot; and later contributed to two tracks on Squier&#x27;s 1986 release, &quot;Enough Is Enough&quot;, providing vocals on &quot;Love is the Hero&quot; and musical arrangements on &quot;Lady With a Tenor Sax&quot;. In 2020, Mercury&#x27;s music video for &quot;Love Me Like There&#x27;s No Tomorrow&quot; was nominated for Best Animation at the Berlin Music Video Awards. Woodlock studio is behind the animation.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===

In the early 1970s, Mercury had a long-term relationship with Mary Austin, whom he met through guitarist Brian May. Austin, born in Fulham, London, met Mercury in 1969 when she was 19 and he was 23 years old, a year before Queen had formed. He lived with Austin for several years in West Kensington, London. By the mid-1970s, he had begun an affair with David Minns, an American record executive at Elektra Records. In December 1976, Mercury told Austin of his sexuality, which ended their romantic relationship. Mercury moved out of the flat they shared, and bought Austin a place of her own near his new address of 12 Stafford Terrace, Kensington.

Mercury and Austin remained friends through the years; Mercury often referred to her as his only true friend. In a 1985 interview, he said of Austin: &quot;All my lovers asked me why they couldn&#x27;t replace Mary, but it&#x27;s simply impossible. The only friend I&#x27;ve got is Mary, and I don&#x27;t want anybody else. To me, she was my common-law wife. To me, it was a marriage. We believe in each other, that&#x27;s enough for me.&quot; Mercury&#x27;s final home, Garden Lodge, an 8-bedroom Georgian mansion in Kensington set in a quarter-acre manicured garden surrounded by a high brick wall, was picked out by Austin. Austin married the painting artist Piers Cameron; they have two children. Mercury was the godfather of her older son, Richard. In his will, Mercury left his London home to Austin, having told her, &quot;You would have been my wife, and it would have been yours anyway.&quot;

From 1979 to 1985, while living in Munich, Mercury was friends with Austrian actress Barbara Valentin, who is featured in the video for &quot;It&#x27;s a Hard Life&quot;, and initially lived together with her and her daughter before moving into his own apartment. In Munich, Mercury was able to escape the media spotlight, lived out his sexuality, drifted in the local gay scene, and had an intense love relationship with German restaurateur Winfried &quot;Winnie&quot; Kirchberger. Mercury also lived temporarily at Kirchberger&#x27;s apartment and thanked him &quot;for board and lodging&quot; in the liner notes of his 1985 album &quot;Mr. Bad Guy&quot;. He wore a silver wedding band given to him by Kirchberger. A close friend described him as Mercury&#x27;s &quot;great love&quot; in Germany.

By 1985, he began another long-term relationship, with Irish-born hairdresser Jim Hutton (1949–2010) whom he referred to as his husband. Mercury described their relationship as one built on solace and understanding, and said that he &quot;honestly couldn&#x27;t ask for better&quot;. Hutton, who tested HIV-positive in 1990, lived with Mercury for the last seven years of his life, nursed him during his illness, and was present at his bedside when he died. Mercury wore a gold wedding band, given to him by Hutton in 1986, until the end of his life. He was cremated with it on. Hutton later relocated from London to the bungalow he and Mercury had built for themselves in Ireland.

===Friendship with Kenny Everett===

Radio disc jockey Kenny Everett met Mercury in 1974, when he invited the singer onto his Capital London breakfast show. As two of Britain&#x27;s most flamboyant, outrageous and popular entertainers, they shared much in common and became close friends. In 1975, Mercury visited Everett, bringing with him an advance copy of the single &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. Despite doubting that any station would play the six-minute track, Everett placed the song on the turntable, and, after hearing it, exclaimed: &quot;Forget it, it&#x27;s going to be number one for centuries&quot;. Although Capital Radio had not officially accepted the song, Everett talked incessantly about a record he possessed but could not play. He then frequently proceeded to play the track with the excuse: &quot;Oops, my finger must&#x27;ve slipped.&quot; On one occasion, Everett aired the song fourteen times over a single weekend. Capital&#x27;s switchboard was overwhelmed with callers inquiring when the song would be released.

During the 1970s, Everett became advisor and mentor to Mercury and Mercury served as Everett&#x27;s confidant. Throughout the early-to-mid-1980s, they continued to explore their homosexuality and use drugs. Although they were never lovers, they did experience London nightlife together. By 1985, they had fallen out, and their friendship was further strained when Everett was outed in the autobiography of his ex-wife Lee Everett Alkin. In 1989, with their health failing, Mercury and Everett were reconciled.

===Other friendships===
Mercury saw the stage version of the London musical &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre in Chelsea, and in 1975 went to see the film version, both of which starred Tim Curry. Curry and Mercury became friends, and as a keen horticulturalist Curry later told the UK edition of &quot;House And Garden&quot; magazine about designing Mercury&#x27;s garden: &quot;Freddie came back from a tour and said, &#x27;The garden, dear, it&#x27;s dead.&#x27; I said, &#x27;What? Did you water it?&#x27; And Freddie said, &#x27;Water it, dear?&#x27;&quot; Both Mercury and Curry were also close friends with Peter Straker; Straker, who first met Mercury at a London restaurant in November 1975, was a frequent diner at Mercury&#x27;s home in Garden Lodge.

Mercury was a long-time friend of Elton John. Shortly before his own death in November 1991, Mercury ordered that a watercolour by John&#x27;s favourite artist, the 19th-century English impressionist painter Henry Scott Tuke, be given to John on Christmas Day. In a 2021 interview, John recalled: &quot;Here was this beautiful man, dying from AIDS, and in his final days, he had somehow managed to find me a lovely Christmas present&quot;.

===Sexual orientation===
While some commentators said Mercury hid his sexual orientation from the public, others said he was &quot;openly gay&quot;. In December 1974, when asked directly, &quot;So how about being bent?&quot; by the &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, Mercury replied, &quot;You&#x27;re a crafty cow. Let&#x27;s put it this way: there were times when I was young and green. It&#x27;s a thing schoolboys go through. I&#x27;ve had my share of schoolboy pranks. I&#x27;m not going to elaborate further.&quot; Homosexual acts between adult males over the age of 21 had been decriminalised in the United Kingdom in 1967, seven years earlier. During public events in the 1980s, Mercury often kept a distance from his partner, Jim Hutton.

Mercury&#x27;s flamboyant stage performances sometimes led journalists to allude to his sexuality. Dave Dickson, reviewing Queen&#x27;s performance at Wembley Arena in 1984 for &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, noted Mercury&#x27;s &quot;camp&quot; addresses to the audience and even described him as a &quot;posing, pouting, posturing tart&quot;. In 1992, John Marshall of &quot;Gay Times&quot; opined: &quot;[Mercury] was a &#x27;scene-queen,&#x27; not afraid to publicly express his gayness, but unwilling to analyse or justify his &#x27;lifestyle&#x27; ... It was as if Freddie Mercury was saying to the world, &#x27;I am what I am. So what?&#x27; And that in itself for some was a statement.&quot; In an article for &quot;AfterElton&quot;, Robert Urban said: &quot;Mercury did not ally himself to &#x27;political outness,&#x27; or to LGBTQ causes.&quot;

Some believe Mercury was bisexual; for example, regarding the creation of Celebrate Bisexuality Day, Wendy Curry said: &quot;We were sitting around at one of the annual bi conventions, venting and someoneI think it was Gigisaid we should have a party. We all loved the great bisexual, Freddie Mercury. His birthday was in September, so why not Sept? We wanted a weekend day to ensure the most people would do something. Gigi&#x27;s birthday was September 23rd. It fell on a weekend day, so, poof! We had a day.&quot; &quot;The Advocate&quot; said in May 2018, &quot;Closeted throughout his life, Mercury, who was bisexual, engaged in affairs with men but referred to a woman he loved in his youth, Mary Austin, as &#x27;the love of his life,&#x27; according to the biography &quot;Somebody to Love: The Life, Death, and Legacy of Freddie Mercury&quot;.&quot; Additionally, according to an obituary Mercury was a &quot;self-confessed bisexual&quot;.

The 2018 biopic of Mercury, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, received criticism for its portrayal of Mercury&#x27;s sexuality, which was described as &quot;sterilized&quot; and &quot;confused&quot;, and was even accused of being &quot;dangerous&quot;.

===Personality===
Although he cultivated a flamboyant stage personality, Mercury was shy and retiring when not performing, particularly around people he did not know well, and granted very few interviews. He once said of himself: &quot;When I&#x27;m performing I&#x27;m an extrovert, yet inside I&#x27;m a completely different man.&quot; On this contrast to &quot;his larger-than-life stage persona&quot;, BBC music broadcaster Bob Harris adds he was &quot;lovely, bright, sensitive, and quite vulnerable.&quot; While on stage, Mercury basked in the love from his audience. Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain&#x27;s suicide note mentions how he admired and envied the way Mercury &quot;seemed to love, relish in the love and adoration from the crowd&quot;.
Mercury never discussed his ethnic or religious background with journalists. The closest he came to doing so was in response to a question about his outlandish persona, he said, &quot;that&#x27;s something inbred, it&#x27;s a part of me. I will always walk around like a Persian popinjay&quot;, an oblique reference to his Indian Parsi background. Feeling a connection to Britain prior to arriving in England, the young Bulsara was heavily influenced by British fashion and music trends while growing up. According to his longtime assistant Peter Freestone, &quot;if Freddie had his way, he would have been born aged 18 in Feltham.&quot; Harris states, &quot;One of the things about Freddie was that he was very civilised and quite &#x27;English&#x27;. I&#x27;d go over to his flat near Shepherd&#x27;s Bush in the afternoon, and he&#x27;d get out the fine china and the sugar lumps and we&#x27;d have a cup of tea.&quot; His flamboyant dress sense and the emergence of glam rock in the UK in the early 1970s saw Mercury wear outfits designed by Zandra Rhodes.

When asked by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in 1981 if rock stars should use their power to try to shape the world for the better, Mercury responded, &quot;Leave that to the politicians. Certain people can do that kind of thing, but very few. John Lennon was one. Because of his status, he could do that kind of preaching and affect people&#x27;s thoughts. But to do this you have to have a certain amount of intellect and magic together, and the John Lennons are few and far between. People with mere talent, like me, have not got the ability or power.&quot; Mercury dedicated a song to the former member of the Beatles. The song, &quot;Life Is Real (Song for Lennon)&quot;, is included in the 1982 album &quot;Hot Space&quot;. Mercury did occasionally express his concerns about the state of the world in his lyrics. His most notable &quot;message&quot; songs are &quot;Under Pressure&quot;, &quot;Is This the World We Created...?&quot; (a song which Mercury and May performed at Live Aid, and also featured in &quot;Greenpeace – The Album&quot;), &quot;There Must Be More to Life Than This&quot;, &quot;The Miracle&quot; (a song May called &quot;one of Freddie&#x27;s most beautiful creations&quot;) and &quot;Innuendo&quot;.

Mercury cared for at least ten cats throughout his life, including: Tom, Jerry, Oscar, Tiffany, Dorothy, Delilah, Goliath, Miko, Romeo, and Lily. He was against the inbreeding of cats for specific features and all except for Tiffany and Lily, both given as gifts, were adopted from the Blue Cross. Mercury &quot;placed as much importance on these beloved animals as on any human life&quot;, and showed his adoration by having the artist Ann Ortman paint portraits of each of them. Mercury wrote a song for Delilah, &quot;his favourite cat of all&quot;, which appeared on the Queen album &quot;Innuendo&quot;. Mercury dedicated his liner notes in his 1985 solo album &quot;Mr. Bad Guy&quot; to Jerry and his other cats. It reads, &quot;This album is dedicated to my cat Jerry—also Tom, Oscar, and Tiffany and all the cat lovers across the universe—screw everybody else!&quot;

In 1987, Mercury celebrated his 41st birthday at the Pikes Hotel, Ibiza, Spain, several months after discovering that he had contracted HIV. Mercury sought much comfort at the retreat and was a close friend of the owner, Anthony Pike, who described Mercury as &quot;the most beautiful person I&#x27;ve ever met in my life. So entertaining and generous.&quot; According to biographer Lesley-Ann Jones, Mercury &quot;felt very much at home there. He played some tennis, lounged by the pool, and ventured out to the odd gay club or bar at night.&quot; The birthday party, held on 5 September 1987, has been described as &quot;the most incredible example of excess the Mediterranean island had ever seen&quot;, and was attended by some 700 people. A cake in the shape of Antoni Gaudi&#x27;s &quot;Sagrada Família&quot; was provided for the party. The original cake collapsed and was replaced with a two-metre-long sponge cake decorated with the notes from Mercury&#x27;s song &quot;Barcelona&quot;. The bill, which included 232 broken glasses, was presented to Queen&#x27;s manager, Jim Beach. Before his death, Mercury had told Beach, &quot;You can do what you want with my music, but don&#x27;t make me boring.&quot;

==Illness and death==

Mercury exhibited HIV/AIDS symptoms as early as 1982. Authors Matt Richards and Mark Langthorne have stated in their biographical book about Mercury, &quot;Somebody to Love: The Life, Death, and Legacy of Freddie Mercury&quot;, that Mercury secretly visited a doctor in New York City to get a white lesion on his tongue checked (which might have been hairy leukoplakia, one of the first signs of an infection) a few weeks before Queen&#x27;s final American appearance with Mercury on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on 25 September 1982, where he began to exhibit the symptoms of someone recently infected with HIV.
In October 1986, two months after Mercury&#x27;s final live performance with Queen at Knebworth House on the Magic Tour, the British newspapers the &quot;News of the World&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot; reported that Mercury had his blood tested for HIV/AIDS at a Harley Street clinic, but he was quoted as saying he was &quot;perfectly fit and healthy&quot;. According to his partner, Jim Hutton, Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS in late April 1987. Around that time, Mercury said in an interview that he had tested negative for HIV.

The British press pursued rumours about Mercury&#x27;s health over the next few years, fuelled by his increasingly gaunt appearance, Queen&#x27;s absence from touring, and reports from his former lovers to tabloid journalists. By 1990, rumours about Mercury&#x27;s health were rife. At the 1990 Brit Awards held at the Dominion Theatre, London, on 18 February, Mercury made his final appearance on stage, when he joined the rest of Queen to collect the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.

Mercury and his inner circle of colleagues and friends continually denied the stories. It has been suggested that Mercury could have helped AIDS awareness by speaking earlier about his illness. Mercury kept his condition private to protect those closest to him; May later confirmed that Mercury had informed the band of his illness much earlier. Filmed in May 1991, the music video for &quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot; features a very thin Mercury in his final scenes in front of the camera. Director of the video Rudi Dolezal comments, &quot;AIDS was never a topic. We never discussed it. He didn&#x27;t want to talk about it. Most of the people didn&#x27;t even 100 percent know if he had it, apart from the band and a few people in the inner circle. He always said, &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to put any burden on other people by telling them my tragedy. The rest of the band were ready to record when Mercury felt able to come into the studio, for an hour or two at a time. May said of Mercury: &quot;He just kept saying. &#x27;Write me more. Write me stuff. I want to just sing this and do it and when I am gone you can finish it off.&#x27; He had no fear, really.&quot; Justin Shirley-Smith, the assistant engineer for those last sessions, said: &quot;This is hard to explain to people, but it wasn&#x27;t sad, it was very happy. He [Freddie] was one of the funniest people I ever encountered. I was laughing most of the time, with him. Freddie was saying [of his illness] &#x27;I&#x27;m not going to think about it, I&#x27;m going to do this.

After the conclusion of his work with Queen in June 1991, Mercury retired to his home in Kensington, West London. His former partner, Mary Austin, was a particular comfort in his final years, and in the last few weeks made regular visits to look after him. Near the end of his life, Mercury began to lose his sight, and declined so that he was unable to leave his bed. Mercury chose to hasten his death by refusing medication and took only painkillers. On 22 November 1991, Mercury called Queen&#x27;s manager Jim Beach to his Kensington home to prepare a public statement, which was released the following day:

=== Death ===
On the evening of 24 November 1991, about 24 hours after issuing the statement, Mercury died at the age of 45 at his home in Kensington. The cause of death was bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS. His close friend Dave Clark of the Dave Clark Five was at the bedside vigil when Mercury died. Austin phoned Mercury&#x27;s parents and sister to break the news, which reached newspaper and television crews in the early hours of 25 November.
Mercury&#x27;s funeral service was conducted on 27 November 1991 by a Zoroastrian priest at West London Crematorium, where he is commemorated by a plinth under his birth name. In attendance at Mercury&#x27;s service were his family and 35 of his close friends, including Elton John and the members of Queen. His coffin was carried into the chapel to the sounds of &quot;Take My Hand, Precious Lord&quot;/&quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; by Aretha Franklin. In accordance with Mercury&#x27;s wishes, Mary Austin took possession of his cremated remains and buried them in an undisclosed location. The whereabouts of his ashes are believed to be known only to Austin, who has said that she will never reveal them. However, they are traditionally held by Queen fans to be Kensal Green Cemetery, where the plinth marks the supposed burial location.

Mercury spent and donated to charity much of his wealth during his lifetime, with his estate valued around £8 million at the time of his death. He bequeathed his home, Garden Lodge, and the adjoining Mews, as well as a 50% of all privately owned shares, to Mary Austin. His sister, Kashmira Cooke, received 25%, as did his parents, Bomi and Jer Bulsara, which Cooke acquired upon their deaths. He willed £500,000 to Joe Fannelli; £500,000 to Jim Hutton; £500,000 to Peter Freestone; and £100,000 to Terry Giddings. Mercury, who never drove a car because he had no licence, was often chauffeured around London in his Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow from 1979 until his death. The car was passed to his sister Kashmira who made it available for display at public events, including the West End premiere of the musical &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; in 2002, before it was auctioned off at the NEC in Birmingham in 2013 for £74,600.

Following his death, the outer walls of Garden Lodge in Logan Place became a shrine to Mercury, with mourners paying tribute by covering the walls in graffiti messages. Three years later &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine reported that &quot;the wall outside the house has become London&#x27;s biggest rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll shrine&quot;. Fans continued to visit to pay their respects with letters appearing on the walls until 2017, when Austin had the wall cleared. Hutton was involved in a 2000 biography of Mercury, &quot;Freddie Mercury, the Untold Story&quot;, and also gave an interview for &quot;The Times&quot; in September 2006 for what would have been Mercury&#x27;s 60th birthday.

==Legacy==

===Continued popularity===
Regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music, Mercury was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal range. He defied the conventions of a rock frontman, with his highly theatrical style influencing the artistic direction of Queen.

The extent to which Mercury&#x27;s death may have enhanced Queen&#x27;s popularity is not clear. In the United States, where Queen&#x27;s popularity had lagged in the 1980s, sales of Queen albums went up dramatically in 1992, the year following his death. In 1992, one American critic noted, &quot;What cynics call the &#x27;dead star&#x27; factor had come into play—Queen is in the middle of a major resurgence.&quot; The movie &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;, which featured &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, also came out in 1992. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Queen had sold 34.5 million albums in the United States by 2004, about half of which had been sold since Mercury&#x27;s death in 1991.
Estimates of Queen&#x27;s total worldwide record sales to date have been set as high as 300 million. In the United Kingdom, Queen have now spent more collective weeks on the UK Album Charts than any other musical act (including the Beatles), and &quot;Queen&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; is the best-selling album of all time in the United Kingdom. Two of Mercury&#x27;s songs, &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; and &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, have also each been voted as the greatest song of all time in major polls by Sony Ericsson and &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. Both songs have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame; &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; in 2004 and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; in 2009. In October 2007 the video for &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; was voted the greatest of all time by readers of &quot;Q&quot; magazine.

Since his death, Queen were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and all four band members were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003. Their Rock Hall of Fame citation reads, &quot;in the golden era of glam rock and gorgeously hyper-produced theatrical extravaganzas that defined one branch of &#x27;70s rock, no group came close in either concept or execution to Queen.&quot; The band were among the inaugural inductees into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. Mercury was individually posthumously awarded the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music in 1992. They received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors in 2005, and in 2018 they were presented the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

===Posthumous Queen album===
In November 1995, Mercury appeared posthumously on Queen&#x27;s final studio album &quot;Made in Heaven&quot;. The album featured Mercury&#x27;s previously unreleased final recordings from 1991, as well as outtakes from previous years and reworked versions of solo works by the other members. The album cover features the Freddie Mercury statue that overlooks Lake Geneva superimposed with Mercury&#x27;s Duck House lake cabin that he had rented. This is where he had written and recorded his last songs at Mountain Studios. The sleeve of the album contains the words, &quot;Dedicated to the immortal spirit of Freddie Mercury.&quot;

Featuring tracks such as &quot;Too Much Love Will Kill You&quot; and &quot;Heaven for Everyone&quot;, the album also contains the song &quot;Mother Love&quot;, the last vocal recording Mercury made before his death, which he completed using a drum machine, over which May, Taylor, and Deacon later added the instrumental track. After completing the penultimate verse, Mercury had told the band he &quot;wasn&#x27;t feeling that great&quot; and stated, &quot;I will finish it when I come back next time&quot;. He never made it back into the studio, so May later recorded the final verse of the song.

===Tributes===

A statue in Montreux, Switzerland, by sculptor Irena Sedlecká, was erected as a tribute to Mercury. It stands almost high overlooking Lake Geneva and was unveiled on 25 November 1996 by Mercury&#x27;s father and Montserrat Caballé, with bandmates Brian May and Roger Taylor also in attendance. Beginning in 2003 fans from around the world have gathered in Switzerland annually to pay tribute to the singer as part of the &quot;Freddie Mercury Montreux Memorial Day&quot; on the first weekend of September.

In 1997 the three remaining members of Queen released &quot;No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)&quot;, a song dedicated to Mercury and all those that die too soon. In 1999 a Royal Mail stamp with an image of Mercury on stage was issued in his honour as part of the UK postal service&#x27;s Millennium Stamp series. In 2009 a star commemorating Mercury was unveiled in Feltham, west London where his family moved upon arriving in England in 1964. The star in memory of Mercury&#x27;s achievements was unveiled on Feltham High Street by his mother Jer Bulsara and Queen bandmate May.
A statue of Mercury stood over the entrance to the Dominion Theatre in London&#x27;s West End from May 2002 to May 2014 for Queen and Ben Elton&#x27;s musical &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;. A tribute to Queen was on display at the Fremont Street Experience in downtown Las Vegas throughout 2009 on its video canopy. In December 2009 a large model of Mercury wearing tartan was displayed in Edinburgh as publicity for the run of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;. Sculptures of Mercury often feature him wearing a military jacket with his fist in the air. In 2018, &quot;GQ&quot; called Mercury&#x27;s yellow military jacket (created by British costume designer Diana Moseley) from his 1986 concerts his best known look, while CNN called it &quot;an iconic moment in fashion.&quot;

For Mercury&#x27;s 65th birthday in 2011, Google dedicated its Google Doodle to him. It included an animation set to his song, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot;. Referring to &quot;the late, great Freddie Mercury&quot; in their 2012 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction speech, Guns N&#x27; Roses quoted Mercury&#x27;s lyrics from &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;; &quot;I&#x27;ve taken my bows, my curtain calls, you&#x27;ve brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it, and I thank you all.&quot;

Tribute was paid to Queen and Mercury at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The band&#x27;s performance of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; with Jessie J was opened with a video of Mercury&#x27;s &quot;call and response&quot; routine from 1986&#x27;s Wembley Stadium performance, with the 2012 crowd at the Olympic Stadium responding appropriately. The frog genus &quot;Mercurana&quot;, discovered in 2013 in Kerala, India, was named as a tribute because Mercury&#x27;s &quot;vibrant music inspires the authors&quot;. The site of the discovery is very near to where Mercury spent most of his childhood. In 2013, a newly discovered species of damselfly from Brazil was named &quot;Heteragrion freddiemercuryi&quot;, honouring the &quot;superb and gifted musician and songwriter whose wonderful voice and talent still entertain millions&quot; — one of four similar damselflies named after the Queen bandmates, in tribute to Queen&#x27;s 40th anniversary. 

On 1 September 2016, an English Heritage blue plaque was unveiled at Mercury&#x27;s home in 22 Gladstone Avenue in Feltham, west London by his sister, Kashmira Cooke, and Brian May. Attending the ceremony, Karen Bradley, the UK Secretary of State for Culture, called Mercury &quot;one of Britain&#x27;s most influential musicians&quot;, and added he &quot;is a global icon whose music touched the lives of millions of people around the world&quot;. On 24 February 2020 a street in Feltham was renamed Freddie Mercury Close during a ceremony attended by his sister Kashmira. On 5 September 2016, the 70th anniversary of Mercury&#x27;s birth, asteroid 17473 Freddiemercury was named after him. Issuing the certificate of designation to the &quot;charismatic singer&quot;, Joel Parker of the Southwest Research Institute added: &quot;Freddie Mercury sang, &#x27;I&#x27;m a shooting star leaping through the sky&#x27; — and now that is even more true than ever before.&quot; In an April 2019 interview, British rock concert promoter Harvey Goldsmith referred to Mercury as &quot;one of our most treasured talents&quot;. 

In August 2019, Mercury was one of the honorees inducted in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco&#x27;s Castro District noting LGBTQ people who have &quot;made significant contributions in their fields&quot;. Freddie Mercury Alley is a alley next to the British embassy in the Ujazdów district in Warsaw, Poland, which is dedicated to Mercury, and was unveiled on 22 November 2019. Until the Freddie Mercury Close in Feltham was dedicated, Warsaw was the only city in Europe with a street dedicated to the singer. In January 2020, Queen became the first band to join Queen Elizabeth II on a British coin. Issued by the Royal Mint, the commemorative £5 coin features the instruments of all four band members, including Mercury&#x27;s Bechstein grand piano and his mic and stand. In April 2022, a life-size statue of Mercury was unveiled in South Korea&#x27;s resort island of Jeju. In May 2024, the crater Bulsara on the planet Mercury was named after his birth name.

Mercury has featured in international advertising to represent the UK. In 2001, a parody of Mercury, along with prints of other British music icons consisting of the Beatles, Elton John, Spice Girls, and the Rolling Stones, appeared in the Eurostar national advertising campaign in France for the Paris to London route. In September 2017 the airline Norwegian painted the tail fin of two of its aircraft with a portrait of Mercury to mark what would have been his 71st birthday. Mercury is one of the company&#x27;s six &quot;British tail fin heroes&quot;, alongside England&#x27;s 1966 FIFA World Cup winning captain Bobby Moore, children&#x27;s author Roald Dahl, novelist Jane Austen, pioneering pilot Amy Johnson, and aviation entrepreneur Sir Freddie Laker.

===Importance in AIDS history===

As the first major rock star to die of AIDS-related complications, Mercury&#x27;s death represented an important event in the history of the disease. In April 1992, the remaining members of Queen founded The Mercury Phoenix Trust and organised &quot;The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert for AIDS Awareness&quot;, to celebrate the life and legacy of Mercury and raise money for AIDS research, which took place on 20 April 1992. The Mercury Phoenix Trust has since raised millions of pounds for various AIDS charities. The tribute concert, which took place at London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium for an audience of 72,000, featured a wide variety of guests including Robert Plant (of Led Zeppelin), Roger Daltrey (of the Who), Extreme, Elton John, Metallica, David Bowie, Annie Lennox, Tony Iommi (of Black Sabbath), Guns N&#x27; Roses, Elizabeth Taylor, George Michael, Def Leppard, Seal and Liza Minnelli, with U2 also appearing via satellite. Elizabeth Taylor spoke of Mercury as &quot;an extraordinary rock star who rushed across our cultural landscape like a comet shooting across the sky&quot;. The concert was broadcast live to 76 countries and had an estimated viewing audience of 1 billion people. The &quot;Freddie for a Day&quot; fundraiser on behalf of the Mercury Phoenix Trust takes place every year in London, with supporters of the charity including Monty Python comedian Eric Idle, and Mel B of the Spice Girls.

The documentary, &quot;Freddie Mercury: The Final Act&quot;, aired on BBC Two in 2021 and The CW in the US in April 2022. It covered Mercury&#x27;s last days, how his bandmates and friends put together the Tribute Concert at Wembley, and interviewed medical professionals, people who tested HIV positive, and others who knew someone who died of AIDS. At the 50th International Emmy Awards in 2022 it won the International Emmy Award for Best Arts Programming.

===Appearances in lists of influential individuals===
Several popularity polls conducted over the past decade indicate that Mercury&#x27;s reputation may have been enhanced since his death. For instance, in a 2002 vote to determine who the UK public considers the greatest British people in history, Mercury was ranked 58 in the list of the 100 Greatest Britons, broadcast by the BBC. He was further listed at the 52nd spot in a 2007 Japanese national survey of the 100 most influential heroes. Although he had been criticised by gay activists for hiding his HIV status, author Paul Russell included Mercury in his book &quot;The Gay 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Gay Men and Lesbians, Past and Present&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Mercury 18 on its &quot;Top 100 Singers Of All Time&quot;. Mercury was voted the greatest male singer in MTV&#x27;s 22 Greatest Voices in Music. In 2011 a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers&#x27; pick placed Mercury in second place of the magazine&#x27;s Best Lead Singers of All Time. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine placed him second on their &quot;25 Best Rock Frontmen (and Women) of All Time&quot; list in 2015, and third on their &quot;50 Greatest Rock Lead Singers of All Time&quot; list in 2023. In 2016, &quot;LA Weekly&quot; ranked him first on the list of 20 greatest singers of all time, in any genre. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Mercury at No. 14 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

===Portrayal on stage===
On 24 November 1997, a monodrama about Freddie Mercury&#x27;s life, titled &quot;&quot;, opened in New York City. It presented Mercury in the hereafter: examining his life, seeking redemption and searching for his true self. The play was written and directed by Charles Messina and the part of Mercury was played by Khalid Gonçalves (né Paul Gonçalves) and then later, Amir Darvish. Billy Squier opened one of the shows with an acoustic performance of a song he had written about Mercury titled &quot;I Have Watched You Fly&quot;.

In 2016 a musical titled &quot;Royal Vauxhall&quot; premiered at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in Vauxhall, London. Written by Desmond O&#x27;Connor, the musical told the alleged tales of the nights that Mercury, Kenny Everett and Princess Diana spent out at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in London in the 1980s. Following several successful runs in London, the musical was taken to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2016 starring Tom Giles as Mercury.

===Portrayal in film and television===
The 2018 biographical film &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; was, at its release, the highest-grossing musical biographical film of all time. Mercury was portrayed by Rami Malek, who received the Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor, for his performance. While the film received mixed reviews and contained historical inaccuracies, it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture – Drama.

Mercury appeared as a supporting character in the BBC television drama &quot;Best Possible Taste: The Kenny Everett Story&quot;, first broadcast in October 2012. He was portrayed by actor James Floyd. He was played by actor John Blunt in &quot;The Freddie Mercury Story: Who Wants to Live Forever&quot;, first broadcast in the UK on Channel 5 in November 2016. Although the programme was criticised for focusing on Mercury&#x27;s love life and sexuality, Blunt&#x27;s performance and likeness to the singer did receive praise.

In 2018, David Avery portrayed Mercury in the &quot;Urban Myths&quot; comedy series in an episode focusing on the antics backstage at Live Aid, and Kayvan Novak portrayed Mercury in an episode titled &quot;The Sex Pistols vs. Bill Grundy&quot;. He was also portrayed by Eric McCormack (as the character Will Truman) on &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; in the October 2018 episode titled &quot;Tex and the City&quot;.

=== Auction ===
From 4 August to 5 September 2023, an exhibition titled, Freddie Mercury: A World of His Own, saw almost 1,500 items of Mercury&#x27;s, which he had given to his former partner Mary Austin, displayed at Sotheby&#x27;s in New Bond Street, London before being sold across six auctions. Nearly 140,000 fans visited the exhibition, which Sotheby&#x27;s had called &quot;the life and work of Britain&#x27;s greatest rock showman of the 20th century&quot;.

A Yamaha baby grand piano used by Mercury to compose many of the band&#x27;s hits, including &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, sold for £1.7 million, while his handwritten lyrics for the song went for £1.38 million. The door of his Garden Lodge home in west London, covered in graffiti left by fans, went for £412,750. The crown and cloak designed by Diana Moseley for the 1986 Magic tour (his final concerts) sold for £635,000. A pair of black striped Adidas high-top shoes (his principal stage footwear from 1984 onward) sold for £127,000. The final evening sale at Sotheby&#x27;s on 6 September took in £12.2 million ($15.4 million), while the six sales in total reached £39.9 million ($50.4 million), smashing Sotheby&#x27;s pre-auction estimates.

<doc id="42069" wikidata="Q15873" url="?curid=42069" title="Brian May">
<text>Sir Brian Harold May (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, songwriter, record producer, animal welfare activist and astrophysicist. He achieved global fame as the lead guitarist and backing vocalist of the rock band Queen, which he co-founded with singer Freddie Mercury and drummer Roger Taylor. His guitar work and songwriting contributions helped Queen become one of the most successful acts in music history.

May previously performed with Taylor in the progressive rock band Smile, which he had joined while he was at university. After Mercury joined to form Queen in 1970, bass guitarist John Deacon completed the line-up in 1971. They became one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; and its single &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. From the mid-1970s until 1986, Queen played at some of the biggest venues in the world, including an acclaimed performance at Live Aid in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the Red Special. May wrote numerous hits for Queen, including &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, &quot;I Want It All&quot;, &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;, &quot;Flash&quot;, &quot;Hammer to Fall&quot;, &quot;Save Me&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot; and &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;.

Following the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the 1992 tribute concert, the release of &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, &quot;No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)&quot; (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists. In 2005, a Planet Rock poll saw May voted the seventh-greatest guitarist of all time. He was ranked at No. 33 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; 2023 list of 250 greatest guitarists of all time. In 2012, he was further ranked the second-greatest guitarist in a &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine readers poll. In 2001, May was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Queen and, in 2018, the band received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

May was appointed a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2005 for services to the music industry and for charity work. May earned a PhD degree in astrophysics from Imperial College London in 2007, and was Chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University from 2008 to 2013. He was a &quot;science team collaborator&quot; with NASA&#x27;s &quot;New Horizons&quot; Pluto mission. He is also a co-founder of the awareness campaign Asteroid Day. Asteroid 52665 Brianmay was named after him. In 2023, May contributed to NASA&#x27;s OSIRIS-REx mission, the agency&#x27;s first successful collection and earth delivery of samples directly from an asteroid (the asteroid Bennu). May is also an animal welfare activist, campaigning against fox hunting and the culling of badgers in the UK. May was knighted by King Charles III in the 2023 New Year Honours for services to music and charity.

==Early life==
Brian Harold May was born on 19 July 1947 at Gloucester House Nursing Home in Hampton Hill, near Twickenham, Middlesex. He is the only child of Ruth Irving (&quot;née&quot; Fletcher) and Harold May, who worked as a draughtsman at the Ministry of Aviation. His mother, who was Scottish, married his father, who was English, at Moulin in Perthshire, Scotland in 1946. May attended the local Hanworth Road state primary school, and at the age of 11 won a scholarship to Hampton Grammar School, then a voluntary aided school. During this time, he formed his first band, named &quot;1984&quot; after George Orwell&#x27;s novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, with vocalist and bassist Tim Staffell.

At Hampton Grammar School, May attained ten GCE Ordinary Levels and three GCE Advanced Levels in physics, mathematics, and applied mathematics. He studied mathematics and physics at Imperial College London, graduating with a BSc degree in physics in 1968 with honours. Following his graduation, May received a personal invitation from Sir Bernard Lovell to work at the Jodrell Bank Observatory while continuing to prepare his doctorate. He declined, choosing instead to remain at Imperial College to avoid breaking from Smile, the London-based band he was in at the time.

In 2007, May earned a PhD degree in astrophysics from Imperial College London for work started in 1971.

==Musical career==
===1968–1970: Smile===
May formed the band Smile in 1968. The group included Tim Staffell as the lead singer and bassist, and later, drummer Roger Taylor, who also went on to play for Queen. The band lasted for only two years, from 1968 to 1970, as Staffell departed in 1970, leaving the band with a catalogue of nine songs. Smile would reunite for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor&#x27;s band The Cross were headliners, and he brought May and Staffell on to play &quot;Earth&quot; and &quot;If I Were a Carpenter&quot;. May also performed several other songs that night.

===1970–1995: Queen===
In Queen&#x27;s three-part vocal harmonies, May was generally the lower-range backing vocalist. On some of his songs, he sings the lead vocals, most notably the first verse of &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot;, the final verse of &quot;Mother Love&quot;, the middle eight on &quot;I Want It All&quot; and &quot;Flash&#x27;s Theme&quot;, and full lead vocals on &quot;Some Day One Day&quot;, &quot;She Makes Me (Stormtrooper in Stilettoes)&quot;, &quot;&#x27;39&quot;, &quot;Good Company&quot;, &quot;Long Away&quot;, &quot;All Dead, All Dead&quot;, &quot;Sleeping on the Sidewalk&quot;, &quot;Leaving Home Ain&#x27;t Easy&quot; and &quot;Sail Away Sweet Sister&quot; .

May frequently wrote songs for the band and has composed many hits such as &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;, &quot;I Want It All&quot;, &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot; and &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; as well as &quot;Hammer to Fall&quot;, &quot;Flash&quot;, &quot;Now I&#x27;m Here&quot;, &quot;Brighton Rock&quot;, &quot;The Prophet&#x27;s Song&quot;, &quot;Las Palabras de Amor&quot;, &quot;No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)&quot; and &quot;Save Me&quot;.
After the Live Aid concert in 1985, Mercury rang his band members and proposed writing a song together. The result was &quot;One Vision&quot;, which was basically May on music (the &quot;Magic Years&quot; documentary shows how he came up with the opening section and the basic guitar riff); the lyrics were co-written by the four band members.

For their 1989 release album, &quot;The Miracle&quot;, the band had decided that all of the tracks would be credited to the entire band, no matter who had been the main writer. Interviews and musical analyses tend to help identify the input of each member on each track. May composed &quot;I Want It All&quot; for that album, as well as &quot;Scandal&quot; (based on his problems with the British press). For the rest of the album, he did not contribute much creatively. However, he helped in building the basis of &quot;Party&quot; and &quot;Was It All Worth It&quot; (both being predominantly Mercury&#x27;s pieces) and created the &quot;Chinese Torture&quot; guitar riff.

Queen&#x27;s subsequent album was &quot;Innuendo&quot;. May&#x27;s contributions increased, although more in terms of arranging than actual writing in most cases. He did some of the arrangement for the heavy solo on the title track. He added vocal harmonies to &quot;I&#x27;m Going Slightly Mad&quot; and composed the solo for &quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot;, a song for which the four of them decided the keyboard parts together.

Two songs May had composed for his first solo album, &quot;Headlong&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Live With You&quot;, eventually ended up on the Queen project. His other composition was &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, which he coordinated and was the primary composer. In recent years, he has supervised the remastering of Queen albums and various DVD and greatest hits releases. In 2004, he announced that he and drummer Roger Taylor were going on tour for the first time in 18 years as &quot;Queen&quot;, along with Free/Bad Company vocalist Paul Rodgers. Billed as &quot;Queen + Paul Rodgers&quot;, the band played throughout 2005 and 2006 in South Africa, Europe, Aruba, Japan, and North America and released a new album with Rodgers in 2008, titled &quot;The Cosmos Rocks&quot;. This album was supported by a major tour.

Paul Rodgers left the band in May 2009. It was not until 2011 that another vocalist, Adam Lambert, was recruited. Queen + Adam Lambert toured Europe in 2012 and toured the world tour over 2014 and 2015. Their most recent outing was the 2016 Festival Tour. They also played the Big Ben New Year concert on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2014 and New Year&#x27;s Day 2015.

===1983–1999: Side projects and solo works===
During 1983, several members of Queen explored side projects. On 21 and 22 April in Los Angeles, May was in a studio with Eddie Van Halen, with no intention of recording anything. The result of the two-day session was a mini album titled &quot;Star Fleet Project&quot;, which was not originally going to be released. In 1986, May contributed to former Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett&#x27;s album &quot;Feedback 86&quot;, playing guitar on the track &quot;Cassandra&quot; and providing guitar and vocals for &quot;Slot Machine&quot;, which May co-wrote. Although produced in 1986, the album was not released commercially until 2000. Another song co-written by May and Hackett during this period, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fall Away from Me&quot;, was eventually recorded by Hackett in 1992 for release on his &quot;The Unauthorised Biography&quot; compilation album. Also in 1986, May worked with actress Anita Dobson on her first album, most noted for the song &quot;Anyone Can Fall in Love&quot;, which added lyrics to the &quot;EastEnders&quot; theme tune and reached number four on the UK Singles Chart in August 1986. May and Dobson married in 2000. In 1988, May contributed guitar solos to the song &quot;When Death Calls&quot; on Black Sabbath&#x27;s 14th album &quot;Headless Cross&quot;, and the Living in a Box track &quot;Blow The House Down&quot; on the album &quot;Gatecrashing&quot;. Both albums were released in 1989.
In the aftermath of the November 1991 death of Mercury, May chose to deal with his grief by committing himself as fully as possible to work, first by finishing his solo album, &quot;Back to the Light&quot;, and then touring worldwide to promote it. He frequently remarked in press interviews that this was the only form of self-prescribed therapy he could think of. According to Def Leppard lead singer Joe Elliott, &quot;It was undoubtedly an enormous and terrible blow to lose someone he was so close to. Personally, I know it ripped the heart out of Brian, but having said that, he was in great spirits after the album was finished.&quot; &quot;Back to the Light&quot; featured the single &quot;Too Much Love Will Kill You&quot;, on which he collaborated as a songwriter with Frank Musker and Elizabeth Lamers. A version with Freddie Mercury&#x27;s vocals was later released on the Queen album &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; and won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically &amp; Lyrically in 1996.

In late 1992, the Brian May Band was officially formed. May had loosely formed an earlier version of the band for 19 October 1991, when May took part in the Guitar Legends guitar festival in Seville, Spain. The line-up for his performance was May on vocals and lead guitar, Cozy Powell on drums and percussion, Mike Moran and Rick Wakeman on keyboards, and Maggie Ryder, Miriam Stockley and Chris Thompson on backing vocals. The original line-up was May on vocals and lead guitar, Powell on drums and percussion, Michael Casswell on guitar, Neil Murray on bass, and Ryder, Stockley and Thompson on backing vocals. This version of the band was together only during the South American support tour (supporting The B-52&#x27;s and Joe Cocker) on five dates.

May later made significant changes, feeling the group never quite gelled. May brought guitarist Jamie Moses on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by Catherine Porter and Shelley Preston. On 23 February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, supporting Guns N&#x27; Roses and headlining a few dates. The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan. On 15 June 1993, the band did a show in London that would end up as The Brian May Band&#x27;s only release as a collective, namely Live at the Brixton Academy. At the show, May would sing a few lines of &quot;Love of My Life&quot;, and then, as Mercury used to, let the audience join in. After the tour ended on 18 December 1993, May returned to the studio with fellow surviving Queen band members Roger Taylor and John Deacon to work on tracks that became &quot;Made in Heaven&quot;, the final Queen studio album. The band took Mercury&#x27;s solo album demos and last recordings, which he managed to perform in the studio after the album &quot;Innuendo&quot; was finished, and completed them with their additions both musically and vocally. After Mercury&#x27;s death, work on the album by Deacon and May began originally in 1992 but was left until a later date due to other commitments.

In 1995, May began working on a new solo album of covers tentatively titled &quot;Heroes&quot;, in addition to working on various film and television projects and other collaborations. May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and new material. The songs included &quot;Another World&quot;, and featured mainly Spike Edney, Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5 April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the M4 motorway near Bristol, England. This incident caused an unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for the Brian May Band, which now needed a new drummer on short notice. Steve Ferrone was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, Eric Singer replaced him on the 1998 world tour.

The 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a &#x27;support act&#x27; known as T. E. Conway. Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a teddy boy crooner) would play several 1950s rock and roll standards before May&#x27;s &#x27;arrival&#x27;. A bonus T. E. Conway EP titled &quot;Retro Rock Special&quot; was attached to some pressings of the &quot;Another World&quot; album. The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.
In May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the Guns N&#x27; Roses song &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; on &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, but his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.

===2000–2010===

From his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor. On 22 October 2000, he made a guest appearance at the Motörhead 25th Anniversary show at Brixton Academy along with Eddie Clarke (former Motörhead guitarist) for the encore song &quot;Overkill&quot;. As part of the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II celebrations on 3 June 2002, May performed a guitar solo of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; from the roof of Buckingham Palace, with the performance appearing on the 30th Anniversary DVD edition of &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;. May played guitar on the song &quot;Someone to Die For&quot; on the &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; soundtrack in 2004.

On the Queen&#x27;s birthday honours list of 2005, he was made a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire &quot;for services to the music industry and for charity work&quot;. In the same year he played the guitar on the song &quot;Il mare...&quot; for Italian singer Zucchero Fornaciari, on his album &quot;Zu &amp; Co.&quot;, and he took part in the concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London held in May 2004, with the other guests of the Italian bluesman. May was a celebrity guest at the Genesis reunion concert at Twickenham Stadium in 2007. May and Genesis frontman Phil Collins worked together on two previous occasions, at The Prince&#x27;s Trust Rock Gala in 1988 and the Party at the Palace in 2002, when Collins had played drums with Queen. In 2011 he contributed to a feature about Collins for &quot;FHM&quot;, praising him as &quot;a great guy and an amazing drummer&quot;.

During the late 1960s, May became an enthusiast of stereoscope photographs, as a child, and first encountered the work of Thomas Richard Williams. In 2003, May announced a search to identify the actual location of the &quot;Scenes in Our Village&quot; images. In 2004 May reported that he had identified the location as the village of Hinton Waldrist in Oxfordshire. Along with Elena Vidal, May released a historical book in 2009 titled &quot;A Village Lost and Found: Scenes in Our Village&quot;. The book is an annotated collection of stereoscopic photographs taken by the Victorian era photographer T. R. Williams. It included a focusing stereoscope.&lt;ref name=&quot;arstechnica/2016/12/may-owl-vr&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; May used a 3D camera to document the history of Queen.
May worked extensively with stage actress and singer Kerry Ellis after he cast her in the musical &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;. He produced and arranged her debut studio album &quot;Anthems&quot; (2010), a follow-up to her extended play &quot;Wicked in Rock&quot; (2008), as well as appearing with Ellis at many public performances—playing guitar alongside her. He also contributed a guitar solo to Meat Loaf&#x27;s &quot;Hang Cool, Teddy Bear&quot; album in exchange for the use of drummer John Miceli.

On 20 May 2009, May and Queen bandmate Roger Taylor performed &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; live on the season finale of &quot;American Idol&quot; with winner Kris Allen and runner-up Adam Lambert providing a vocal duet. In November 2009, May appeared with Taylor on &quot;The X Factor&quot;, with Queen mentoring the contestants, then later performed &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. In April 2010, May founded the &quot;Save Me&quot; 2010 project to work against any proposed repeal of the British fox-hunting ban, and to promote animal welfare in Britain. In February 2011, it was announced that May would tour with Kerry Ellis, playing 12 dates across the UK in May 2011.

===2004–2009: Queen + Paul Rodgers===

At the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005, with Paul Rodgers, the founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company. Brian May&#x27;s website also stated that Rodgers would be &quot;featured with&quot; Queen as Queen + Paul Rodgers, not replacing the late Freddie Mercury. The retired John Deacon would not be participating.

Between 2005 and 2006 Queen and Paul Rodgers embarked on a world tour, the first leg being Europe and the second, Japan and the US in 2006. On 25 May 2006, Queen received the inaugural VH1 Rock Honors at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, and May and Taylor were joined on stage with the Foo Fighters to perform a selection of Queen songs. On 15 August 2006, May confirmed through his website and fan club that Queen + Paul Rodgers would begin producing their first studio album in October, to be recorded at a &quot;secret location&quot;. The album, titled &quot;The Cosmos Rocks&quot;, was released in Europe on 12 September 2008 and in the United States on 28 October 2008. Following the album&#x27;s release, the band embarked on a tour through Europe and parts of the US, opening on Kharkiv&#x27;s freedom square in front of 350,000 Ukrainian fans. The show in Ukraine was later released on DVD. Queen and Paul Rodgers officially split up on 12 May 2009. Rodgers did not rule out the possibility of working together again.

===2011–present===

On 18  April 2011, Lady Gaga confirmed that May would play guitar on her track &quot;You and I&quot; from her latest album &quot;Born This Way&quot;, released on 23 May 2011. May joined Gaga on stage during the performance of &quot;You and I&quot; at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards held at Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles. May performed with Tangerine Dream at the Starmus Festival on Tenerife in June 2011, celebrating the 50th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin&#x27;s first spaceflight.

May performed &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Black Parade&quot; with the rock band My Chemical Romance at the Reading Festival on 26 August 2011. On 10 October, May made an appearance to celebrate the reunion of rock band The Darkness at an &quot;intimate&quot; 100 Club show with support from Dark Stares. A long-time fan of the group, May performed three songs onstage with The Darkness, including Queen&#x27;s &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;, at the Hammersmith Apollo on their subsequent &quot;comeback&quot; tour.

At the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards on 6 November, Queen received the Global Icon Award, which Katy Perry presented to Brian May. Queen closed the awards ceremony, with Adam Lambert on vocals, performing &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;. The collaboration garnered a positive response from both fans and critics, resulting in speculation about future projects together. Queen + Adam Lambert played two shows at the Hammersmith Apollo, London, on 11 and 12 July 2012. Both shows sold out within 24 hours of tickets going on open sale. A third London date was added for 14 July. On 30 June, Queen + Lambert performed in Kyiv, Ukraine at a joint concert with Elton John for the Elena Pinchuk ANTIAIDS Foundation. Queen also performed with Lambert on 3 July 2012 at Moscow&#x27;s Olympic Stadium, and on 7 July 2012 at the Municipal Stadium in Wroclaw, Poland.
In January 2012, May featured on N-Dubz frontman Dappy&#x27;s solo single &quot;Rockstar&quot;, providing &quot;rumbling guitar riffs which culminate in an electrifying solo&quot;. The pair also collaborated on a performance of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; for BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Live Lounge.

Queen performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London on 12 August 2012. May performed part of the &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; solo before being joined by Taylor and solo artist Jessie J for a performance of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;. On 16 September 2012, May appeared at the Sunflower Jam charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall, performing alongside bassist John Paul Jones (of Led Zeppelin), drummer Ian Paice (of Deep Purple), and vocalists Bruce Dickinson (of Iron Maiden) and Alice Cooper.

In a 2013 West End run of &quot;Spamalot&quot; (the musical adaptation of Monty Python&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;), May was among the celebrities who played the part of voicing God for a week in aid of charity. In 2015, May played guitar on the end credits song &quot;One Voice&quot; from the film &quot;A Dog Named Gucci&quot;. The song also features the talents of: Norah Jones, Aimee Mann, Susanna Hoffs, Lydia Loveless, Neko Case, and Kathryn Calder. It was produced by Dean Falcone, who wrote the film&#x27;s score. &quot;One Voice&quot; was released on Record Store Day, 16 April 2016, with profits from the sale of the single going to benefit animal charities.

Welsh electronic musician Jayce Lewis collaborated with May in 2018 on the song &quot;We Are One&quot;, taken from Lewis&#x27; 2018 album release &quot;Million&quot;. Incorporating a repurposed &quot;Finger tapping/Hammering&quot; riff from May&#x27;s solo track &quot;Cyborg&quot; from his album; Another World (Brian May album), both artists re-recorded May&#x27;s guitar at a slower speed, and included it to the new song composition.

On 29 March 2019, May inducted Def Leppard into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He worked with contemporary metal band Five Finger Death Punch and blues artist Kenny Wayne Shepherd to re-record a new version of &quot;Blue on Black&quot; in support of The Gary Sinise Foundation in April 2019. The artists came together to merge country and mainstream rock to re-create the classic song originally co-written by Shepherd.

In 2024, May contributed guitar to a re-release of Mark Knopfler&#x27;s &quot;Going Home: Theme of the Local Hero&quot; in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.

====Queen + Adam Lambert====

Not long after performing with &quot;American Idol&quot; finalists Kris Allen and Adam Lambert during the programme&#x27;s season finale in 2009, May and Taylor began contemplating the future of Queen after the group&#x27;s amicable split with frontman Paul Rodgers. At the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards, Queen was presented with that year&#x27;s Global Icon Award, accepted by May. As part of the broadcast, Queen performed a short set with Lambert, receiving an overwhelmingly welcoming response. Speculation regarding collaboration with Lambert soon arose, with the three formally announcing a short summer tour of Europe in 2012, including three dates at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, as well as shows in Ukraine, Russia and Poland.
The collaboration was revived in 2013, when the three performed together at the iHeartRadio Music Festival at the MGM Grand Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas on 20 September. Five months later, May, Taylor and Lambert announced a 19-date summer tour of North America on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Because of ticket demand, five dates were soon added. In May 2014, shows in Australia and New Zealand were announced, along with festival performances in South Korea and Japan. The tour was extended to the UK and greater Europe in early 2015. The group performed together in South America in September 2015, including Queen&#x27;s first performance at the Rock in Rio Festival since 1985.
In 2016, the group embarked across Europe and Asia on the Queen + Adam Lambert 2016 Summer Festival Tour. This included closing the Isle of Wight Festival in England on 12 June where they performed &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot; as a tribute to the victims of the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida earlier that day. On 12 September they performed at the Yarkon Park in Tel Aviv, Israel for the first time in front of 58,000 people. In September 2018 the group had a residency in the MGM Park Theater in Las Vegas. Though the collaboration remains active, there are currently no plans to record a studio album, though the three are willing to do so in the future.
On 31 March 2020, Queen + Adam Lambert confirmed that their touring dates were postponed until 2021 because of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

On 4 June 2022, Queen + Adam Lambert opened the Platinum Party at the Palace outside Buckingham Palace to mark the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II. Performing a three-song set, May appeared in front of the Victoria Memorial monument as they opened with &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; which had been introduced in a comedy segment where the Queen and Paddington Bear tapped their tea cups to the beat of the song.

==Musicianship==

===Guitar style===


May has been referred to as a virtuoso guitarist by many publications and musicians. He has featured in various music polls of the greatest rock guitarists, and in 2011 was ranked number 26 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. In January 2007, the readers of &quot;Guitar World&quot; voted May&#x27;s guitar solos on &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; and &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; into the &quot;top 50 Greatest Guitar Solos of all time&quot; (No.20 and No.41 respectively). Former Van Halen vocalist Sammy Hagar stated, &quot;I thought Queen were really innovative and made some great sounding records... I like the rockin&#x27; stuff. I think Brian May has one of the great guitar tones on the planet, and I really, really love his guitar work.&quot; Justin Hawkins, lead guitarist of the Darkness, cites May as his earliest influence, saying &quot;I really loved his tone and vibrato and everything. I thought his playing sounded like a singing voice. I wanted to be able to do that. Whenever I went to guitar lessons, I was always asking to learn Queen stuff.&quot;

American guitar virtuoso Steve Vai has spoken highly of May&#x27;s work, saying:

Most of May&#x27;s electric guitar work live and in the studio is done on the Red Special, which he built with his father, an electronics engineer, when he was sixteen years old. It was built with wood from an 18th-century fireplace, and was composed of household items such as mother-of-pearl buttons, shelf edging, and motorbike valve springs. While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May did not need to build another guitar. These plans were eventually given to guitar luthier Andrew Guyton in around 2004–05. Guyton made some slight modifications and the guitar was built. It was named &quot;The Spade&quot; as the body&#x27;s shape resembled the form shown on playing cards. The guitar also came to be known as &quot;The Guitar That Time Forgot&quot;.

May commented on the Red Special:

In addition to using his home-made guitar he prefers to use coins (especially a sixpence from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic plectrum, because he feels their rigidity gives him more control in playing. He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.

A meticulous arranger, he focuses on multi-part harmonies, often more contrapuntal than parallel—a relative rarity for rock guitar. Examples are found in Queen&#x27;s albums &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; and &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;, where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (&quot;Good Company&quot;), a vocal canon (&quot;The Prophet&#x27;s Song&quot;) and guitar and vocal counterpoints (&quot;Teo Torriatte&quot;).

May explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: sweep picking (&quot;Was It All Worth It&quot; &quot;Chinese Torture&quot;); tremolo (&quot;Brighton Rock&quot;, &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;, &quot;Death on Two Legs&quot;, &quot;Sweet Lady&quot;, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, &quot;Get Down Make Love&quot;, &quot;Dragon Attack&quot;); tapping (&quot;Bijou&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Late&quot;, &quot;Resurrection&quot;, &quot;Cyborg&quot;, &quot;Rain Must Fall&quot;, &quot;Business&quot;, &quot;China Belle&quot;, &quot;I Was Born To Love You&quot;); slide guitar (&quot;Drowse&quot;, &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;); Hendrix sounding licks (&quot;Liar&quot;, &quot;Brighton Rock&quot;); tape-delay (&quot;Brighton Rock&quot;, &quot;White Man&quot;); and melodic sequences (&quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, &quot;Killer Queen&quot;, &quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot;). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by Freddie Mercury, who then asked May to bring them to life (&quot;Bicycle Race&quot;, &quot;Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon&quot;, &quot;Killer Queen&quot;, &quot;Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy&quot;). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of &quot;White Queen&quot; (from &quot;Queen II&quot;), &quot;Love of My Life&quot; and the skiffle-influenced &quot;&#x27;39&quot; (both from &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;).

Aided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song &quot;Procession&quot;; in &quot;Get Down, Make Love&quot; he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in &quot;Good Company&quot; he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song&#x27;s Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a &quot;No synthesizers were used on this album&quot; sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners. May also used his guitar to create the chime effect in &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;.

===Influences===

May&#x27;s early influences included Cliff Richard and the Shadows, who he says were &quot;the most metallic thing(s) out at the time&quot;. Many years later he gained his opportunity to play on separate occasions with the Shadows&#x27; lead guitarist Hank Marvin. He has collaborated with Richard on a re-recording of 1958 hit &quot;Move It&quot; on Richard&#x27;s duets album &quot;Two&#x27;s Company&quot;, which was released on 6 November 2006.

May always stated that the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, the Who and Jimi Hendrix were the greatest influences on him. On the &quot;Queen for an Hour&quot; interview on BBC Radio 1 in 1989, May listed Hendrix, Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton as his guitar heroes. In a 1991 interview for &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine, May referred to the Who as &quot;my inspiration&quot;, and on seeing Led Zeppelin stated, &quot;We used to look at those guys and think, &#x27;That&#x27;s the way it should be done.&#x27;&quot; May told &quot;Guitarist&quot; in 2004, &quot;I don&#x27;t think anyone has epitomised riff writing better than Jimmy Page – he&#x27;s one of the great brains of rock music&quot;.

May also cites Rory Gallagher as a major influence, saying &quot;He was a magician. He was one of the very few people of that time who could make his guitar do anything, it seemed. I remember looking at that battered Stratocaster and thinking, &#x27;How does that (sound) come out of there?&#x27;&quot; According to May, &quot;... it was Rory that gave me my sound, and that&#x27;s the sound I still have.&quot; May was also influenced by Steve Hackett, guitarist of the progressive rock band Genesis, in particular his harmony guitar solo at the end of the band&#x27;s epic 1971 song &quot;The Musical Box&quot;. Hackett said of May, &quot;Equally, his energetic approach to guitar inspired me.&quot;

===Equipment===

====Guitars====
From 1975 onwards, May had some replicas made of the Red Special, some of which were also used for live and recording purposes, others being mainly spares. The most famous replicas were made by John Birch in 1975 (May smashed it during a concert in the US in 1982), Greco BM90 (featured in the promo video of &quot;Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy&quot; in 1977), Guild (back-up from 1984 to 1993), Fryers (1997–1998, used both live and in the studio) and Guyton (back-up from 2003 to present). On stage, May used to carry at least one backup guitar (in case he broke a string). He occasionally would use others for specific songs or parts, such as alternative tunings. Currently, May owns a company that makes guitars whose design is modelled after the original Red Special guitar.

*July 1973 – May 1974: Fender Stratocaster CBS era (thought to be 1972)
*October 1974 – May 1975: Gibson Les Paul Deluxe, and the Stratocaster from the previous tour.
*November 1975 – May 1976: Same two guitars as before, plus a natural finish John Birch replica of the Red Special.
*September 1976: Same three as before, plus a Martin D-18 acoustic for &quot;&#x27;39&quot;.
*January 1977 – August 1979: Just the Birch replica plus an Ovation Pacemaker 12-string acoustic on some numbers (&quot;&#x27;39&quot;, &quot;Love of My Life&quot;, &quot;Dreamer&#x27;s Ball&quot;).
*November 1979 – June 1982: Birch replica (back-up), Fender Telecaster (&quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; 2nd verse, middle-eight and solo), Ovation (acoustic numbers).
*July – November 1982: Added a Gibson Flying V as second back-up. On 9 August 1982, May smashed the Birch guitar, so the Flying V became the only spare.
*August – October 1984: The Flying V became a second back-up again as his main spare was the Guild replica. He also used Roger Taylor&#x27;s Gibson Chet-Atkins Classical Electric.
*July 1985 – August 1986: Gibson Flying V no longer used. The rest remained the same. May used a Gibson Chet-Atkins guitar on the 1986 Magic Tour.
*In 2012, he received a double-neck replica of the Red Special, with the second neck having 12-strings. He used this guitar at a few gigs with Adam Lambert now being able to play the 12-string part from the studio version of &quot;Under Pressure&quot; live.

He currently has a Gibson 12-string SJ200 to replace his Guild 12-string. He previously used an Ovation Pacemaker 1615 model. Some of the non-RS electric guitars he used in the studio included:
*Burns Double Six on &quot;Long Away&quot; (1976) and &quot;Under Pressure&quot; (1981).
*Fender Telecaster on &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; (1979). May used it for the video (but not the recordings) of &quot;Back Chat&quot; (1982).
*Gibson Firebird on &quot;Hammer to Fall&quot; and &quot;Tear It Up&quot; (album versions only, not on stage).
*Ibanez JS on &quot;Nothing But Blue&quot; (1991).
*Parker Fly on &quot;Mother Love&quot; (1993–1995).

For acoustic, he favoured Ovation, Martin, Tōkai Hummingbird, Godin and Guild. On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on &quot;Play the Game&quot; (1980) and a Washburn RR2V on &quot;Princes of the Universe&quot; (1986).

In 1984, Guild released the first official Red Special replica for mass production and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid-body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not a replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy. The production of the guitars stopped after just 300 guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000 copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer—the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998—as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May&#x27;s original one has a sixpence).

====Amplifiers and effects====
May has used Vox AC30 amplifiers almost exclusively since a meeting with his long-time hero Rory Gallagher at a gig in London during the late 1960s/early 1970s. In the mid-1970s he used six of them, with an Echoplex delay (with extended delay time) plugged into a separate amplifier, and a second Echoplex plugged into yet another amp; he used a homemade booster, his only effects pedal, which was on all the time. His choice is the model AC30TBX, the top-boost version with Blue Alnico speakers, and he runs the amp at full volume on the Normal channel.

May also customises his amps by removing the Brilliant and Vib-trem channels (leaving only the circuitry for the Normal). This alters the tone slightly, with a gain addition of 6–7 dB. He always used a treble booster which, along with the AC30 and his custom &#x27;Deacy Amp&#x27; transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones. He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;. Effects designer Pete Cornish built for him the TB-83 (32 dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer&#x27;s booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.

When performing live, May uses banks of Vox AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, flanger and chorus. He has a rack of 14 AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay 1, Delay 2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a BOSS pedal from the &#x27;70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in &quot;In The Lap of The Gods&quot; (&quot;Live at Wembley &#x27;86&quot;) or &quot;Hammer to Fall&quot; (slow version played live with P. Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (&quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;, &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;, etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in &quot;Brighton Rock&quot;.

====Piano and other instruments====
As a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band&#x27;s primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on &quot;Save Me&quot; and &quot;Flash&quot;). He mostly used Freddie Mercury&#x27;s 1972 Steinway piano. From 1979 onwards, he also played synthesisers, organ (&quot;Wedding March&quot;, &quot;Let Me Live&quot;) and programmed drum-machines for both Queen and outside projects (such as producing other artists and his own solo records). In the studio, May used Yamaha DX7 synths for the opening sequence of &quot;One Vision&quot; and the backgrounds of &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot; (also on stage), &quot;Scandal&quot; and &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;.

The first instrument May learned to play was the banjolele. He used a &quot;genuine George Formby Ukulele-Banjo&quot; in &quot;Bring Back That Leroy Brown&quot; and &quot;Good Company&quot;. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a Yamaha plastic piano in &quot;Teo Torriatte&quot; and a toy mini koto in &quot;The Prophet&#x27;s Song&quot;.

====Vocals====
May is also an accomplished singer. From Queen&#x27;s &quot;Queen II&quot; to &quot;The Game&quot;, May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with Lee Holdridge, &quot;Il Colosso&quot;, for Steve Barron&#x27;s 1996 film, &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;. May performed the opera with Jerry Hadley, Sissel Kyrkjebo, and Just William. On-screen, it was performed entirely by puppets.

==Scientific career==
May studied physics and mathematics at Imperial College London, graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and ARCS in physics with Upper Second-Class Honours. From 1970 to 1974, he studied for a PhD degree at Imperial College, studying reflected light from interplanetary dust and the velocity of dust in the plane of the Solar System. When Queen began to have international success in 1974, he abandoned his doctoral studies, but nonetheless co-authored two peer-reviewed research papers, which were based on his observations at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife.

In October 2006, May re-registered for his doctorate at Imperial College, and he submitted his thesis in August 2007 (one year earlier than he estimated it would take to complete). As well as writing up the previous work he had done, May had to review the work on zodiacal dust undertaken during the intervening 33 years, which included the discovery of the zodiacal dust bands by NASA&#x27;s IRAS satellite. After a viva voce, the revised thesis (titled &quot;A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud&quot;) was approved in September 2007, some 37 years after it had been commenced. He was able to submit his thesis only because of the minimal amount of research on the topic during the intervening years and has described the subject as one that became in-demand again in the 2000s. In his doctoral research, he investigated radial velocity using absorption spectroscopy and doppler spectroscopy of zodiacal light using a Fabry–Pérot interferometer based at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife. His research was initially supervised by Jim Ring, Ken Reay and in the latter stages by Michael Rowan-Robinson. He graduated at the awards ceremony of Imperial College held in the Royal Albert Hall on 14 May 2008.
In October 2007, May was appointed a visiting researcher in Imperial College and he continues his interest in astronomy and involvement with the Imperial Astrophysics Group. He is co-author, with Sir Patrick Moore and Chris Lintott, of &quot;Bang! – The Complete History of the Universe&quot; and &quot;The Cosmic Tourist&quot;. May appeared on the 700th episode of &quot;The Sky at Night&quot; hosted by Sir Patrick Moore, along with Chris Lintott, Jon Culshaw, Professor Brian Cox, and the Astronomer Royal Martin Rees who, on departing the panel, told Brian May, who was joining it, &quot;I don&#x27;t know a scientist who looks as much like Isaac Newton as you do.&quot; May was also a guest on the first episode of the third series of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Stargazing Live&quot;, on 8 January 2013.

On 17 November 2007, May was appointed chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University, and he was installed in 2008 having also been awarded an honorary fellowship from the university for his contribution to astronomy and services to the public understanding of science. He held the post until 2013. Asteroid 52665 Brianmay was named after him on 18 June 2008 on the suggestion of Patrick Moore (probably influenced by the asteroid&#x27;s provisional designation of ).
In 2014, May co-founded Asteroid Day with Apollo 9 astronaut Rusty Schweickart, B612 Foundation COO Danica Remy and German filmmaker Grigorij Richters. Asteroid Day is a global awareness campaign where people from around the world come together to learn about asteroids and what we can do to protect our planet. May was a guest at the 2016 Starmus Festival where he also performed on stage with composer Hans Zimmer. The theme was &quot;Beyond The Horizon: A Tribute To Stephen Hawking&quot;.

During the &quot;New Horizons&quot; Pluto flyby NASA press conference held on 17 July 2015 at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, May was introduced as a science team collaborator. He told the panel &quot;You have inspired the world.&quot; From 31 December 2018 until 1 January 2019, May was in attendance at the watch party for the New Horizons flyby of the Kuiper belt object, 486958 Arrokoth, and performed an updated version of his &quot;New Horizons&quot; celebratory song. As part of May&#x27;s role as a collaborator with NASA&#x27;s science team on the New Horizons mission, he worked on the first stereoanaglyph based on images of (486958) Arrokoth that were captured by the spacecraft.

In 2019, he was awarded the Lawrence J. Burpee Medal of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society for outstanding contributions to the advancement of geography.

In 2020, he participated in the team that contributed the stereography images of numerical simulations of asteroid disruptions and re-accumulations in a publication in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications by Michel, P. et al. (2020) presenting a scenario of formation of the asteroids (101955) Bennu and (162173) Ryugu, visited by NASA OSIRIS-REx and JAXA Hayabusa2 probes, respectively. He was awarded the JAXA Hayabusa2 Honor Award for his contribution by making stereoscopic images of Ryugu.
In 2021, he contributed the stereography images of the structural stability of double asteroid (65803) Didymos, the target of the NASA DART and ESA Hera missions, in a publication in the peer-reviewed journal Icarus by DART and Hera team members. He is also on the advisory board of the NEO-MAPP project (Near-Earth-Object Modelling and Payloads for Protection), funded by the European Union.

In 2022, May was awarded a Doctorate of Science honoris causa by Professor Brad Gibson in the EA Milne Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Hull. Unable to attend in person, he joined the graduation ceremony via video link. At the Starmus IV festival in Yerevan, Armenia in September 2022, May was awarded the Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication.

In December 2022 May was made a Knight Bachelor in the 2023 New Year Honours, the first list of King Charles III&#x27;s reign. In March 2023, May was officially knighted by the King.

==Personal life==
From 1976 to 1988, May was married to Christine Mullen. They had three children. They separated in 1988. May met actress Anita Dobson in 1986. She inspired him to write the 1989 hit &quot;I Want It All&quot;. They married on 18 November 2000.

He has said in interviews that he had depression in the late 1980s and early 1990s, to the point of contemplating suicide, for reasons having to do with his troubled first marriage, his perceived failure as a husband and father, and the deaths of Mercury and his father Harold.

According to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Rich List of 2019, May is worth £160 million. He has homes in London and Windlesham, Surrey. May&#x27;s father Harold was a long-time heavy cigarette smoker. As a result, May dislikes smoking, to the point where he was already prohibiting smoking indoors at his concerts before many countries imposed smoking bans.

A vegan since taking part in the 2020 Veganuary challenge, May has stated that meat eating is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. May describes himself as &quot;not belonging to an organized religion, but feels there is a god of some kind which we know very little about&quot;.

May is a long-term champion of woodland as a haven and &quot;corridor&quot; for wildlife—both in Surrey, where he has a house, and elsewhere. In 2012, he bought land threatened by building development at Bere Regis, Dorset, and, in 2013 and with the enthusiastic support of local villagers, initiated a project to create an area of woodland, now called May&#x27;s Wood (or &quot;the Brian May Wood&quot;). The wood consists of , formerly under the plough, planted by May&#x27;s team of co-workers with 100,000 trees. May&#x27;s Wood is said to be flourishing.

In 2013, a new species of the genus &quot;Heteragrion&quot; (Odonata: Zygoptera) from Brazil was named &quot;Heteragrion brianmayi&quot;—one of four &quot;Heteragrion&quot; flatwing damselflies named after the bandmates, paying tribute to the 40th anniversary of Queen&#x27;s founding.

May experienced a small heart attack in May 2020. It required the insertion of three stents into three blocked arteries. May said he had been &quot;very near death&quot;. In September 2024, he revealed that he had suffered a minor stroke which rendered him temporarily without use of his left arm, though May noted he was still able to play guitar.

===Activism===
Though a Conservative Party voter most of his life, he has stated that their policies on fox hunting and the culling of badgers meant he did not vote for them in the 2010 UK general election. 

In 2013, May joined French guitar player Jean-Pierre Danel for a charity Danel launched for the benefit of animal rights in France. The guitarists signed guitars and art photos together, and were joined by Hank Marvin.

Prior to the 2015 general election, it was reported that May was considering standing as an independent Member of Parliament. It was also revealed that May had started a &quot;Common Decency&quot; project &quot;to re-establish common decency in our lives, work and Parliament&quot;. May said he wanted to &quot;get rid of the current government&quot; and wished to see a House of Commons containing &quot;individuals voting according to their conscience&quot;. May was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party&#x27;s Caroline Lucas at the election. He also endorsed a Conservative Party candidate, Henry Smith, on the grounds of his animal welfare record.

In July 2015, May criticised UK Prime Minister David Cameron for giving Members of Parliament a free vote on amending the ban on fox hunting in England and Wales. During a live television interview, he described the pro-hunting organisation the Countryside Alliance as &quot;a bunch of lying bastards&quot; for their support for a change to the law. The government postponed the vote following the intervention of the Scottish National Party&#x27;s Westminster MPs, who committed to vote to keep the ban as it existed. May told anti-hunt protesters in a rally outside Parliament that it was &quot;a very, very important day for our democracy&quot; but added &quot;we have not yet won the war, there&#x27;s no room for complacency&quot;.

In June 2017, May endorsed Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 general election. May shared an article on Twitter by &quot;The Independent&quot; headlined &quot;Jeremy Corbyn says Fox hunting is &#x27;barbarity&#x27; and pledges to keep it banned&quot; and captioned it: &quot;Well, I guess that just about clinches it !! Anyone see any good reason not to prefer the evidently decent Corbyn over the weak and wobbly Mrs May? Bri&quot;.

In October 2018, May said, &quot;I don&#x27;t like all this separatist stuff and you know this sort of illusion that we can all stand on our own, to me the future lies in co-operation. I get up every day and put my head in my hands about Brexit – I think it&#x27;s the stupidest thing we ever tried to do.&quot; He also said that Prime Minister Theresa May was &quot;driven by vanity and thirst for power&quot;.

In the run-up to the 2019 United Kingdom general election May criticised what he saw as the poor conduct of the media and declined to endorse either candidate, stating that he found it &quot;impossible&quot; to vote for either Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson. After the election in which the Conservatives won a majority, May vowed to continue fighting for animal welfare but in an Instagram and blog post he urged his followers to congratulate Johnson and &quot;wish Boris a decent chance to rebuild Britain&quot; before praising reforms to animal welfare laws made by Conservative Party Environment Secretary Michael Gove. In 2021 May criticised Johnson for his response to the COVID-19 pandemic, calling it inadequate.

In the lead up to the 2019 Okinawan referendum on landfill work at Henoko Bay for the expansion of the base in Okinawa, Japan, May advocated voting in opposition to the landfill.

===Animal welfare===

In 2010, May formed an animal welfare organisation Save Me (named after the May-written Queen song). It campaigns for the protection of wild animals with a particular emphasis on preventing hunting of foxes and the culling of badgers. May has commented that &quot;to this day, nobody has been able to prove a mechanism for the transfer of bTB from badger to cow&quot; and has suggested that culling badgers has no benefit. The group&#x27;s primary concern is to ensure that the Hunting Act 2004 and other laws protecting animals are retained in situ.

In an interview in September 2010 with Stephen Sackur for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;HARDtalk&quot; program, May said that he would rather be remembered for his animal welfare work than for his music or scientific work. May is supporter of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the League Against Cruel Sports, PETA UK and the Harper Asprey Wildlife Rescue. In March 2012, May contributed the foreword to a target paper published by the think tank the Bow Group, urging the government to reconsider its plans to cull thousands of badgers to control bovine TB, stating that the findings of Labour&#x27;s major badger culling trials, several years earlier, show that culling does not work. The paper was authored by Graham Godwin-Pearson with contributions by leading tuberculosis scientists, including Lord Krebs. This prefaced his 2024 documentary, &quot;Brian May: The Badgers, the Farmers and Me,&quot; the culmination of a four-year investigation into whether badger culling is necessary for bovine TB prevention.

In October 2010, May received an award from the International Fund for Animal Welfare in recognition of his animal welfare work.

In May 2013, May teamed up with actor Brian Blessed and Flash cartoonist Jonti &quot;Weebl&quot; Picking, as well as animal welfare groups including the RSPCA, to form Team Badger, a &quot;coalition of organisations that have teamed up to fight the planned cull of badgers&quot;. With Weebl and Blessed, May recorded a single, &quot;Save the Badger Badger Badger&quot;—a mashup of Weebl&#x27;s viral 2003 Flash cartoon meme, &quot;Badger Badger Badger&quot;, and Queen&#x27;s &quot;Flash&quot;, featuring vocals by Blessed. On 1 September 2013, &quot;Save the Badger Badger Badger&quot; charted at No. 79 on the UK Singles Chart, No. 39 on the UK iTunes chart and No. 1 on the iTunes Rock chart. In June 2013 naturalist Sir David Attenborough and rock guitarist Slash joined May to form a supergroup, Artful Badger and Friends, and released a song dedicated to badgers, &quot;Badger Swagger&quot;.

May is a former vice-president of the RSPCA. In September 2024, he resigned his position as vice-president after &quot;damning evidence&quot; emerged of animal welfare failings at RSPCA Assured farms.

===Stereophotography===
May has had a lifelong interest in collecting Victorian stereophotography. In 2009, with co-author Elena Vidal, he published his second book, &quot;A Village Lost and Found,&quot; on the work of English stereophotography innovator T. R. Williams. He was awarded The Royal Photographic Society&#x27;s Saxby Medal in 2012 for achievement in the field of three-dimensional imaging.

May made a significant technical contribution to the book to accompany the exhibition &#x27;Stereoscopic Photographs of Pablo Picasso by Robert Mouzillat&#x27;, held at the Holburne Museum in Bath, England, from February to June 2014. The book provides photographs of Picasso in his studio, at a bullfight at Arles, and in his garden. May&#x27;s 3D Owl viewer is used to view the photographs in 3D.

The purchase of his first card in 1973 started May on a lifelong and worldwide search for Les Diableries, which are stereoscopic photographs depicting scenes of daily life in Hell. On 10 October 2013 the book &quot;Diableries: Stereoscopic Adventures in Hell&quot; by Brian May, Denis Pellerin and Paula Fleming was published.

In 2017, May published &quot;Queen in 3-D&quot;, chronicling the group&#x27;s 50-year history. It contains over 300 of his own stereoscopic photos and is the first book about the band published by one of its members. Included with the book is May&#x27;s patented OWL Stereoscopic Viewer.

In 2021, May was awarded an honorary fellowship and Denis Pellerin was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Literature from the Royal Holloway College, University of London. The conferred degrees recognised their work to preserve Victorian stereoscopy through the London Stereoscopic Company. It recognises their contribution to photography and preservation.

==Portrayal in film==
In the 2018 biographical film &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, he was portrayed by Gwilym Lee. May himself served as a creative and musical consultant for the film, and worked especially closely with Lee.

<text>John Kenneth Ousterhout (, born October 15, 1954) is an American computer scientist. He is a professor of computer science at Stanford University. He founded Electric Cloud with John Graham-Cumming. 

Ousterhout was previously a professor of computer science at University of California, Berkeley, where he created the Tcl scripting language and the Tk platform-independent widget toolkit, and proposed the idea of coscheduling. Ousterhout led the research group that designed the experimental Sprite operating system and the first log-structured file system.
Ousterhout also led the team that developed the Magic VLSI computer-aided design (CAD) program.

== Education and career ==
He received a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in physics from Yale University in 1975, and his Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1980.

Ousterhout received the Grace Murray Hopper Award in 1987 for his work on electronic design automation CAD systems for very-large-scale integrated circuits. For the same work, he was inducted in 1994 as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. Ousterhout was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2001 for improving our ability to program computers by raising the level of abstraction.

In 1994, Ousterhout left Berkeley to join Sun Microsystems Laboratories, which hired a team to join him in Tcl development. After several years at Sun, he left and co-founded Scriptics, Inc. (later renamed Ajuba Solutions) in January 1998 to provide professional Tcl development tools. Most of the Tcl team followed him from Sun. Ajuba was purchased by Interwoven in October 2000. He joined the faculty of Stanford University in 2008.

<doc id="42074" wikidata="Q908666" url="?curid=42074" title="Port Authority of New York and New Jersey">
<text>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, (PANYNJ; stylized, in logo since 2020, as Port Authority NY NJ) is a joint venture between the U.S. states of New York and New Jersey, established in 1921 through an interstate compact authorized by the United States Congress. The Port Authority oversees much of the regional transportation infrastructure, including bridges, tunnels, airports, and seaports, within the geographical jurisdiction of the Port of New York and New Jersey. This port district is generally encompassed within a radius of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. The Port Authority is headquartered at 4 World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan.

The Port Authority operates the Port Newark–Elizabeth Marine Terminal, which consistently ranks among the largest ports in the United States by tonnage handled, and the largest on the Eastern Seaboard. The Port Authority also operates six bi-state crossings: three connecting New Jersey with Manhattan, and three connecting New Jersey with Staten Island. The Port Authority Bus Terminal and the PATH rail system are also run by the Port Authority, as well as LaGuardia Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, Teterboro Airport and Stewart International Airport. The agency has its own 2,100 member Port Authority Police Department.

== History ==

The Port of New York and New Jersey comprised the main point of embarkation for U.S. troops and supplies sent to Europe during World War I, via the New York Port of Embarkation. The congestion at the port led experts to realize the need for a port authority to supervise the extremely complex system of bridges, highways, subways, and port facilities in the New York-New Jersey area. The solution was the 1921 creation of the Port Authority under the supervision of the governors of the two states. By issuing its own bonds, it was financially independent of either state; the bonds were paid off from tolls and fees, not from taxes. It became one of the major agencies of the metropolitan area for large-scale projects. Early bond issues were tied to specific projects, but this changed in 1935 when the Authority issued General and Refunding bonds with a claim on its general revenues.

=== Previous disputes ===
In the early years of the 20th century, there were disputes between the states of New Jersey and New York over rail freights and boundaries. At the time, rail lines terminated on the New Jersey side of the harbor, while ocean shipping was centered on Manhattan and Brooklyn. Freight had to be shipped across the Hudson River in barges. In 1916, New Jersey launched a lawsuit against New York over issues of rail freight, with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) issuing an order that the two states work together, subordinating their own interests to the public interest. The Harbor Development Commission, a joint advisory board set-up in 1917, recommended that a bi-state authority be established to oversee efficient economic development of the port district. The Port of New York Authority was established on April 30, 1921, through an interstate compact between the states of New Jersey and New York. This was the first such agency in the United States, created under a provision in the Constitution of the United States permitting interstate compacts. The idea for the Port Authority was conceived during the Progressive Era, which aimed at the reduction of political corruption and at increasing the efficiency of government. With the Port Authority at a distance from political pressures, it was able to carry longer-term infrastructure projects irrespective of the election cycles and in a more efficient manner. In 1972 it was renamed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to better reflect its status as a partnership between the two states.

Throughout its history, there have been concerns about democratic accountability, or lack thereof at the Port Authority. The Port District is irregularly shaped but comprises a area roughly within a radius of the Statue of Liberty.

=== Interstate crossings ===

At the beginning of the 20th century, there were no road bridge or tunnel crossings between the two states. The initial tunnel crossings were completed privately by the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad in 1908 and 1909 (&quot;Hudson Tubes&quot;), followed by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1910 (&quot;North River Tunnels&quot;). Under an independent agency, the Holland Tunnel was opened in 1927, with some planning and construction pre-dating the Port Authority. With the rise in automobile traffic, there was demand for more Hudson River crossings. Using its ability to issue bonds and collect revenue, the Port Authority has built and managed major infrastructure projects. Early projects included bridges across the Arthur Kill, which separates Staten Island from New Jersey. The Goethals Bridge, named after chief engineer of the Panama Canal Commission General George Washington Goethals, connected Elizabeth, New Jersey and Howland Hook, Staten Island. At the south end of Arthur Kill, the Outerbridge Crossing was built and named after the Port Authority&#x27;s first chairman, Eugenius Harvey Outerbridge. Construction of both bridges was completed in 1928. The Bayonne Bridge, opened in 1931, was built across the Kill van Kull, connecting Staten Island with Bayonne, New Jersey.

Construction began in 1927 on the George Washington Bridge, linking the northern part of Manhattan with Fort Lee, New Jersey, with Port Authority chief engineer, Othmar Ammann, overseeing the project. The bridge was completed in October 1931, ahead of schedule and well under the estimated costs. This efficiency exhibited by the Port Authority impressed President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who used this as a model in creating the Tennessee Valley Authority and other such entities.

In 1930, the Holland Tunnel was placed under the control of the Port Authority, providing significant toll revenues. The Port Authority also controlled the Lincoln Tunnel, connecting New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan. The Lincoln Tunnel opened in 1937 as a single-tube tunnel; a second tube opened in 1945, and a third tube opened in 1957.

In 1962, the Port Authority absorbed the bankrupt Hudson &amp; Manhattan Railroad and reorganized it as Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH). As part of the deal, the Port Authority acquired the rights to build the original World Trade Center on the site of the old Hudson Terminal, one of two terminals in Manhattan for H&amp;M/PATH.

=== Austin J. Tobin era ===
==== Airport expansion ====
In 1942, Austin J. Tobin became the executive director of the Port Authority. In the post-World War II period, the Port Authority expanded its operations to include airports, and marine terminals, with projects including Newark Liberty International Airport and Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminals. Meanwhile, the city-owned La Guardia Field was nearing capacity in 1939 and needed expensive upgrades and expansion. At the time, airports were operated as loss leaders, and the city was having difficulties maintaining the status quo, losing money and unable to undertake needed expansions. The city was looking to hand the airports over to a public authority, possibly to Robert Moses&#x27; Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. After long negotiations with the City of New York, a 50-year lease, commencing on May 31, 1947, went to the Port Authority of New York to rehabilitate, develop, and operate La Guardia Airport (La Guardia Field), John F. Kennedy International Airport (Idlewild Airport), and Floyd Bennett Field. The Port Authority transformed the airports into fee-generating facilities, adding stores and restaurants.

==== World Trade Center ====
David Rockefeller, president of Chase Manhattan Bank, envisioned a World Trade Center for lower Manhattan. Realizing that he needed public funding in order to construct the massive project, he approached Tobin. Although many questioned the Port Authority&#x27;s entry into the real estate market, Tobin saw the project as a way to enhance the agency&#x27;s power and prestige, and agreed to the project. The Port Authority was the overseer of the World Trade Center, hiring the architect Minoru Yamasaki and engineer Leslie Robertson.

Yamasaki ultimately settled on the idea of twin towers. To meet the Port Authority&#x27;s requirement to build of office space, the towers would each be 110 stories tall. The size of the project raised ire from the owner of the Empire State Building, which would lose its title of tallest building in the world. Other critics objected to the idea of this much &quot;subsidized&quot; office space going on the open market, competing with the private sector. Others questioned the cost of the project, which in 1966 had risen to $575million. Final negotiations between The City of New York and the Port Authority centered on tax issues. A final agreement was made that the Port Authority would make annual payments in lieu of taxes, for the 40% of the World Trade Center leased to private tenants. The remaining space was to be occupied by state and federal government agencies. In 1962, the Port Authority signed the United States Customs Service as a tenant, and in 1964 they signed a deal with the State of New York to locate government offices at the World Trade Center.

In August 1968, construction on the World Trade Center&#x27;s north tower started, with construction on the south tower beginning in January 1969. When the World Trade Center twin towers were completed, the total cost to the Port Authority had reached $900million. The buildings were dedicated on April 4, 1973, with Tobin, who had retired the year before, absent from the ceremonies.

In 1986, the Port Authority sold rights to the World Trade Center name for $10 to an organization run by an outgoing executive, Guy F. Tozzoli. He in turn made millions of dollars selling the use of the name in up to 28 different states.

After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the Port Authority was sued by survivors of the attack for negligence in not making security upgrades to known flaws that could have prevented the attack. The Port Authority was ruled to be negligent.

=== September 11 attacks ===
The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent collapse of the World Trade Center buildings impacted the Port Authority. With the Port Authority&#x27;s headquarters located in 1 World Trade Center, it became deprived of a base of operations and sustained a great number of casualties. An estimated 1,400 Port Authority employees worked in the World Trade Center. Eighty-four employees, including 37 Port Authority police officers, its executive director, Neil D. Levin, and police superintendent, Fred V. Morrone, died. In rescue efforts following the collapse, two Port Authority police officers, John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno, were pulled out alive after spending nearly 24 hours beneath of rubble. Their rescue was later portrayed in the 2006 Oliver Stone film &quot;World Trade Center&quot;. Future Executive Director Christopher O. Ward was at the World Trade Center on 9/11, and is a survivor of the attack. Ward was Chief of External Affairs &amp; Director of Port Development under Neil Levin at the time. As the executive director from 2008 to 2011, he is credited with turning around Ground Zero construction and having the memorial ready for the 10th anniversary. A former attorney for the PANYNJ who worked on 9/11 related issues is now on the federal bench, Angel Kelley.

=== Fort Lee lane closure scandal ===

The Fort Lee lane closure scandal was a US political scandal that concerns New Jersey Governor Chris Christie&#x27;s staff and his Port Authority political appointees conspiring to create a traffic jam in Fort Lee, New Jersey as political retribution, and their attempts to cover up these actions and suppress internal and public disclosures. Dedicated toll lanes for one of the Fort Lee entrances (used by local traffic from Fort Lee and surrounding communities) to the upper level on the George Washington Bridge, which connects to Manhattan, were reduced from three to one from September 9–13, 2013. The toll lane closures caused massive Fort Lee traffic back-ups, which affected public safety due to extensive delays by police and emergency service providers and disrupted schools due to the delayed arrivals of students and teachers. Two Port Authority officials (who were appointed by Christie and would later resign) claimed that reallocating two of the toll lanes from the local Fort Lee entrance to the major highways was due to a traffic study evaluating &quot;traffic safety patterns&quot; at the bridge, but the executive director of the Port Authority was unaware of a traffic study.

, the repercussions and controversy surrounding these actions continue to be under investigation by the Port Authority, federal prosecutors, and a New Jersey legislature committee. The Port Authority&#x27;s chairman, David Samson, who was appointed by Governor Christie, resigned on March 28, 2014, amid allegations of his involvement in the scandal and other controversies.

=== Caren Turner scandal ===
In April 2018, Caren Turner resigned from the Board of Commissioners after an ethics investigation revealed that her attempt to intervene in a traffic stop for her daughter included what the Port Authority described as &quot;profoundly disturbing&quot; conduct. New Jersey police released a videotape of her attempting to leverage her position at the Port Authority to intimidate police officers, following a routine traffic stop of a vehicle in which her adult daughter was a passenger. Her case was referred to New Jersey&#x27;s Ethics Commission.

=== Ownership swap of Brooklyn Marine and Howland Hook terminals ===
In May 2024, the Authority transferred ownership of the Brooklyn Port Authority Marine Terminal &amp; Red Hook Container Terminal to the City of New York in exchange for ownership of the Howland Hook Marine Terminal on Staten Island.

== Governance ==

The Port Authority is jointly controlled by the governors of New York and New Jersey, who appoint the members of the agency&#x27;s Board of Commissioners and retain the right to veto the actions of the commissioners from their own state. Each governor appoints six members to the Board of Commissioners, who are subject to state senate confirmation and serve overlapping six-year terms without pay. An executive director is appointed by the board of commissioners to deal with day-to-day operations and to execute the Port Authority&#x27;s policies. Under an informal power-sharing agreement, the governor of New Jersey chooses the chairman of the board and the deputy executive director, while the governor of New York selects the vice chairman and executive director.

The Port Authority is headquartered at 4 World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. The agency was headquartered at 1 World Trade Center in the first World Trade Center complex, where it occupied of space. It had been headquartered in the WTC complex beginning in 1973. After the previous headquarters were destroyed in the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Port Authority moved into 225 Park Avenue South in Midtown Manhattan, with employees divided between offices in New York and New Jersey, before returning to the World Trade Center in 2015.

Financially, the Port Authority has no power to tax and does not receive tax money from any local or state governments. Instead, it operates on the revenues it makes from its rents, tolls, fees, and facilities.

=== Board of Commissioners ===
Meetings of the Board of Commissioners are public. Members of the public may address the Board at these meetings, subject to a prior registration process via email. Public records of the Port Authority may be requested via the Office of the Secretary according to an internal Freedom of Information policy which is intended to be consistent with and similar to the state Freedom of Information policies of both New York and New Jersey.

Members of the Board of Commissioners are typically business titans and political power brokers who maintain close relationships with their respective governors. On February 3, 2011, former New Jersey Attorney General David Samson was named the new chairman of the Port Authority by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Gov. Christie announced Samson&#x27;s resignation in March 2016, a casualty of investigations into the &quot;Bridgegate&quot; scandal. Basil Paterson, father of former Governor David Paterson, served on the board from 1989 to 1995, and again from 2013 to 2014.

The current commissioners are:

== Facilities ==

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey manages and maintains infrastructure critical to the New York/New Jersey region&#x27;s trade and transportation network—five of the region&#x27;s airports, the New York/New Jersey seaport, the PATH rail transit system, six tunnels and bridges between New York and New Jersey, the Port Authority Bus Terminal and George Washington Bridge Bus Station in Manhattan and The World Trade Center site.

=== Seaports ===

The Port of New York and New Jersey is the largest port complex on the East Coast of North America. In 2021, Port Authority seaports handled the fourth largest amount of shipping among U.S. ports, measured in total tonnage. As of August 2022, the Port Authority led the country when considering only containers and not bulk materials such as petroleum and grain.

The Port Authority operates the following seaports:
* Port Jersey Marine Terminal in Bayonne and Jersey City
* Howland Hook Marine Terminal on Staten Island
* Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal in Newark and Elizabeth, the first in the nation to containerize.

The Port Authority operates the ExpressRail rail services within the seaport area, including dockside trackage and railyards for transloading. It interchanges with Conrail Shared Assets Operations (CRCX) on the Chemical Coast Secondary, Norfolk Southern (NS), CSX Transportation (CSX), and Canadian Pacific (CP). From January through October 2014 the system handled 391,596 rail lifts. As of 2014, three ExpressRail systems (Elizabeth, Newark, Staten Island) were in operation with the construction of a fourth at Port Jersey underway.

The Port Authority operates New York New Jersey Rail, LLC (NYNJ), a switching and terminal railroad operating a car float operation across Upper New York Bay between the Greenville Yard in Jersey City and Brooklyn.

=== Airports ===
The Port Authority operates the following airports:
* Atlantic City International Airport, (Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey) (performs select management duties)
* John F. Kennedy International Airport (Queens, New York)
* LaGuardia Airport (Queens, New York)
* Newark Liberty International Airport (Newark and Elizabeth, New Jersey)
* Stewart International Airport, (Newburgh, New York)
* Teterboro Airport (Teterboro, New Jersey)
Both Kennedy and LaGuardia airports are owned by the City of New York and leased to the Port Authority for operating purposes. Newark Liberty is owned by the cities of Elizabeth and Newark and is also leased to the Authority. In 2007, Stewart International Airport, owned by the State of New York, was leased to the Port Authority. The Port Authority officially took over select management functions of the Atlantic City International Airport on July 1, 2013, in conjunction with the South Jersey Transportation Authority, which leases the airport site from the FAA.

JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark Liberty as a whole form the largest airport system in the United States, second in the world in terms of passenger traffic, and first in the world by total flight operations, with JFK being the 19th busiest in the world and the 6th busiest in the U.S.

=== Heliports ===
The Authority operated the Downtown Manhattan Heliport (Manhattan, New York) until the lease expired in August 2007 but continued to operate it until the next lessee took over. The Authority had operated the other heliports in Manhattan but gave up leases for all of them over the years.

=== Bridges and tunnels ===
The Port Authority manages every crossing between New York City and New Jersey, which include the George Washington Bridge, the Lincoln Tunnel, and the Holland Tunnel, which all connect Manhattan and Northern New Jersey, as well as the Goethals Bridge, the Bayonne Bridge, and the Outerbridge Crossing, which connect Staten Island and New Jersey. They also maintain many entrances approaches to these crossings, such as the GWB Plaza and Lincoln Tunnel Helix.

=== Bus and rail transit ===

The Port Authority operates the PATH rapid transit system linking lower and midtown Manhattan with New Jersey, the AirTrain Newark system linking Newark International Airport with NJ Transit and Amtrak via a station on the Northeast Corridor rail line, and the AirTrain JFK system linking JFK with the Howard Beach subway station and the Jamaica subway and Long Island Rail Road stations.

Major bus depots include the Port Authority Bus Terminal at 42nd Street, the George Washington Bridge Bus Station, and the Journal Square Transportation Center in Jersey City.

The PANYNJ is a major stakeholder in the Gateway Program. The program will upgrade the Northeast Corridor by building two new tunnels under the Hudson River paralleling the existing North River Tunnels, as well as connecting infrastructure.

The Port Authority also owns and operates a network of shuttle buses on its airport properties. As of 2017, the agency operates 23 Orion buses at Newark Airport, 7 at LaGuardia Airport, and 40 at JFK Airport, all purchased in 2007 and 2009.

=== Real estate ===
The Port Authority also participates in joint development ventures around the region, including the Teleport business park on Staten Island, Bathgate Industrial Park in the Bronx, the Industrial Park at Elizabeth, the Essex County Resource Recovery Facility, Newark Legal Center, Queens West in Long Island City, and the South Waterfront in Hoboken. However, by April 2015, the agency was considering divesting itself of the properties to raise revenue and return to the core mission of supporting transportation infrastructure.

The Port Authority has always owned the 16-acre World Trade Center land, both the old WTC and the new WTC. However, some of the office space on the old complex and in the new one have been leased, managed, or built by Silverstein Properties, notablly 3 World Trade Center (2018) and 7 World Trade Center (1987 and 2006 respectfully).

=== Current and future projects ===

==== World Trade Center ====
Major projects by the Port Authority include One World Trade Center and other construction at the World Trade Center complex. Other projects include a new passenger terminal at JFK International Airport, and redevelopment of Newark Liberty International Airport&#x27;s Terminal B, and replacement of the Goethals Bridge. The Port Authority also has plans to buy 340 new PATH cars and begin major expansion of Stewart International Airport.

As owner of the World Trade Center complex, the Port Authority has worked since 2001 on plans for reconstruction of the site, along with Silverstein Properties, and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. In 2006, the Port Authority reached a deal with Larry Silverstein, which ceded control of One World Trade Center to the Port Authority. The deal gave Silverstein rights to build three towers along the eastern side of the site, including 150 Greenwich Street, 175 Greenwich Street, and 200 Greenwich Street. Also part of the plans was the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, which opened in March 2016 and replaced the temporary PATH station that opened in November 2003.

==== Airports ====
The Port Authority began construction of a new terminal at Newark Airport in June 2017. The new facility will replace Terminal A and will open in 2022. The PATH&#x27;s Newark–World Trade Center train route is planned to be extended from its terminus at Newark Penn Station to a new Newark Liberty International Airport Station. The PANYNJ announced in March 2023 that it was deferring funding for the Newark Airport extension to a future capital plan.

Another Port Authority project involves redeveloping LaGuardia Airport, replacing three existing terminals with a single terminal. Terminal B would be demolished and terminals C and D would be merged. Some of additional taxiways are to be built, and transportation around the terminals would be reorganized. The redevelopment is expected to cost $7.6billion in total. Construction started in 2016, and the first part of the new terminal opened in 2021, with completion in 2026. As part of the reconstruction, the AirTrain LGA people mover system was to have been built between the airport and Willets Point, Queens. The AirTrain was supposed to start construction in 2020 and be completed by 2022, but the project was canceled in March 2023 after several years of delays.

The Port Authority is also planning to redevelop the entirety of John F. Kennedy International Airport, replacing four existing terminals with two new terminals at a cost of $11billion. Roadway access, as well as train capacity on the AirTrain JFK, would be expanded. Under the plan, the first gates would open in 2023, and the project would be complete in 2025. Work on a new Terminal 1 began in 2022, and work on Terminal 6 began in early 2023. In addition, Terminal 4 was expanded.

== Law enforcement ==

The Port Authority has its own police department. In 2001, the department employed approximately 4,000 police officers and supervisors who had full police status in the states of New York and New Jersey.

<text>The Vardar (; , , ) or Axios (, ) is the longest river in North Macedonia and a major river in Greece, where it reaches the Aegean Sea at Thessaloniki. It is long, out of which are in Greece, and drains an area of around . The maximum depth of the river is .

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Vardar&quot; for the river may have been derived from Thracian, although Dardanian, Paeonian, Ancient Macedonian and Ancient Greek were also spoken in the lands drained by the river.

The modern Vardar is thought to derive from an earlier *&quot;Vardários&quot;, which may ultimately derive from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) *&quot;(s)wordo-wori-&quot; &quot;black water&quot;. The name &quot;Vardários&quot; (Βαρδάριος) was sometimes used by the Ancient Greeks in the 3rd century BC. The same name was widely used in the Byzantine era. 

Vardar/Vardarios may be a translation of (or otherwise have a similar meaning as) &quot;Axios&quot;, which may be Thracian and may have meant &quot;not-shining&quot; from PIE *&quot;n.-sk(e)i&quot; (cf. Avestan &quot;axšaēna&quot; &quot;dark-coloured&quot;). The oldest known name of the river, &quot;Axios&quot;, is mentioned by Homer (Il. 21.141, Il. 2.849) as the home of the Paeonians allies of Troy. Pjetër Bogdani would use the form &quot;Asi&quot;, an earlier Albanian-language name for the river.

This same hypothetical Thracian &quot;Axio-&quot; meaning &quot;dark, not-shining&quot; is theorized to be found in the name of a city at the mouth of the Danube, called Axiopolis in Greek and &quot;Axíopa&quot; (perhaps again meaning just &quot;dark water&quot;) in Thracian, which may later have been translated into Slavic as &quot;Cernavodă&quot;, also meaning &quot;black water&quot;.

==Geography==

The river rises at Vrutok, a few kilometers southwest of Gostivar in North Macedonia. It passes through Gostivar, Skopje and into Veles, crosses the Greek border near Gevgelija, Polykastro and Axioupoli (&quot;town on the Axiós&quot;), before emptying into the Aegean Sea in Central Macedonia, west of Thessaloniki in northern Greece. The river forms a large delta along with Loudias and Haliacmon at the Axios-Loudias-Aliakmonas National Park.

The Vardar basin comprises two-thirds of the territory of North Macedonia. The valley features fertile lands in the Polog region, around Gevgelija and in the Thessaloniki regional unit. The river is surrounded by mountains elsewhere. The superhighways Greek National Road 1 in Greece and M1 and E75 run within the valley along the river&#x27;s entire length to near Skopje.

The river was very famous during the Ottoman Empire and remains so in modern-day Turkey as the inspiration for many folk songs, of which the most famous is Vardar Ovasi. It has also been depicted on the coat of arms of Skopje, which in turn is incorporated in the city&#x27;s flag.

==Project to construct the Danube-Vardar-Aegean Canal==

A proposal to construct a canal connecting the Morava river valley with the Vardar, and hence linking the Danube to the Aegean Canal, has been a dream for a long time. Le Figaro published a project of Athens and Belgrade on 28.08.2017. The Greek-Serbian proposal made in Beijing is Pharaonic: 651 km. A project worth 17 billion.

==Vardaris wind==
The &quot;Vardaris&quot; or &quot;Vardarec&quot; is a powerful prevailing northerly ravine wind which blows across the river valley in Greece as well as in North Macedonia. At first it descends along the &quot;canal&quot; of the Vardar valley, usually as a breeze. When it encounters the high mountains that separate Greece from North Macedonia, it descends the other side, gathering a tremendous momentum and bringing cold conditions to the city of Thessaloniki and the Axios delta. Somewhat similar to the mistral wind of France, it occurs when atmospheric pressure over eastern Europe is higher than over the Aegean Sea, as is often the case in winter.

<text>In linguistics, grammatical person is the grammatical distinction between deictic references to participant(s) in an event; typically, the distinction is between the speaker (first person), the addressee (second person), and others (third person). A language&#x27;s set of pronouns is typically defined by grammatical person. &quot;First person&quot; includes the speaker (English: &quot;I&quot;, &quot;we&quot;), &quot;second person&quot; is the person or people spoken to (English: &quot;your&quot; or &quot;you&quot;), and &quot;third person&quot; includes all that are not listed above (English: &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;it&quot;, &quot;they&quot;). It also frequently affects verbs, and sometimes nouns or possessive relationships.

==Related classifications==

===Number===
In Indo-European languages, first-, second-, and third-person pronouns are typically also marked for singular and plural forms, and sometimes dual form as well (grammatical number).

===Inclusive/exclusive distinction===
Some other languages use different classifying systems, especially in the plural pronouns. One frequently found difference not present in most Indo-European languages is a contrast between inclusive and exclusive &quot;we&quot;: a distinction of first-person plural pronouns between including or excluding the addressee.

===Honorifics===
Many languages express person with different morphemes in order to distinguish degrees of formality and informality. A simple honorific system common among European languages is the T–V distinction. Some other languages have much more elaborate systems of formality that go well beyond the T–V distinction, and use many different pronouns and verb forms that express the speaker&#x27;s relationship with the people they are addressing. Many Malayo-Polynesian languages, such as Javanese and Balinese, are well known for their complex systems of honorifics; Japanese, Korean, and Chinese also have similar systems to a lesser extent.

==Effect on verbs==
In many languages, the verb takes a form dependent on the person of the subject and whether it is singular or plural. In English, this happens with the verb &quot;to be&quot; as follows:
* I &quot;am&quot; (first-person singular)
* you &quot;are&quot;/thou &quot;art&quot; (second-person singular)
* he, she, one, it &quot;is&quot; (third-person singular)
* we &quot;are&quot; (first-person plural)
* you &quot;are&quot;/ye &quot;are&quot; (second-person plural)
* they &quot;are&quot; (third-person plural, and third-person singular)

Other verbs in English take the suffix &quot;-s&quot; to mark the present tense third person singular, excluding singular &#x27;they&#x27;.

In many languages, such as French, the verb in any given tense takes a different suffix for any of the various combinations of person and number of the subject.

==Additional persons==

The grammar of some languages divide the semantic space into more than three persons. The extra categories may be termed fourth person, fifth person, etc. Such terms are not absolute but can refer, depending on context, to any of several phenomena.

Some Algonquian languages and Salishan languages divide the category of third person into two parts: &quot;proximate&quot; for a more topical third person, and &quot;obviative&quot; for a less topical third person. The obviative is sometimes called the fourth person. In this manner, Hindi and Bangla may also categorize pronouns in the fourth, and with the latter a fifth person. 

The term fourth person is also sometimes used for the category of indefinite or generic referents, which work like &quot;one&quot; in English phrases such as &quot;one should be prepared&quot; or &quot;people&quot; in &quot;people say that...&quot;, when the grammar treats them differently from ordinary third-person forms. The so-called &quot;zero person&quot; in Finnish and related languages, in addition to passive voice, may serve to leave the subject-referent open. Zero person subjects are sometimes translated as &quot;one&quot;, although in tone it is similar to English&#x27;s generic you &quot;&quot; (&quot;Not allowed to touch&quot;, &quot;You should not touch&quot;).

<doc id="42078" wikidata="Q26075" url="?curid=42078" title="Hydrogen cyanide">
<text>Hydrogen cyanide (formerly known as prussic acid) is a chemical compound with the formula HCN and structural formula . It is a highly toxic and flammable liquid that boils slightly above room temperature, at . HCN is produced on an industrial scale and is a highly valued precursor to many chemical compounds ranging from polymers to pharmaceuticals. Large-scale applications are for the production of potassium cyanide and adiponitrile, used in mining and plastics, respectively. It is more toxic than solid cyanide compounds due to its volatile nature. A solution of hydrogen cyanide in water, represented as HCN, is called &quot;hydrocyanic acid&quot;. The salts of the cyanide anion are known as cyanides.

Whether hydrogen cyanide is an organic compound or not is a topic of debate among chemists, and opinions vary from author to author. Traditionally, it is considered inorganic by a significant number of authors. Contrary to this view, it is considered organic by other authors, because hydrogen cyanide belongs to the class of organic compounds known as nitriles which have the formula , where R is typically organyl group (e.g., alkyl or aryl) or hydrogen. In the case of hydrogen cyanide, the R group is hydrogen H, so the other names of hydrogen cyanide are methanenitrile and formonitrile.

==Structure and general properties==
Hydrogen cyanide is a linear molecule, with a triple bond between carbon and nitrogen. The tautomer of HCN is HNC, hydrogen isocyanide.

=== Smell ===
Much literature has historically claimed that hydrogen cyanide smells of almonds or bitter almonds. However, there has been considerable confusion and disagreement over this, because the smell of household almond essence is due to benzaldehyde, which is released &quot;along with&quot; hydrogen cyanide from the breakdown of amygdalin present in some plant seeds, and thus is often mistaken for it. In an experiment to test what hydrogen cyanide smells like, the chemistry Youtuber &quot;NileRed&quot; described the smell as &quot;&quot;not at all like an almond&quot; but like &quot;weak bleach or chlorine&quot; or &quot;swimming pools&quot;&quot;.

About half of people are unable to detect the smell of hydrogen cyanide owing to a recessive genetic trait.

The volatile compound has been used as inhalation rodenticide and human poison, as well as for killing whales. Cyanide ions interfere with iron-containing respiratory enzymes.

==Chemical properties==
Hydrogen cyanide is weakly acidic with a p&quot;K&quot;a of 9.2. It partially ionizes in water to give the cyanide anion, . HCN forms hydrogen bonds with its conjugate base, species such as .

Hydrogen cyanide reacts with alkenes to give nitriles. The conversion, which is called hydrocyanation, employs nickel complexes as catalysts.

Four molecules of HCN will tetramerize into diaminomaleonitrile.

Metal cyanides are typically prepared by salt metathesis from alkali metal cyanide salts, but mercuric cyanide is formed from aqueous hydrogen cyanide:

==History of discovery and naming==
Hydrogen cyanide was first isolated in 1752 by French chemist Pierre Macquer who converted Prussian blue to an iron oxide plus a volatile component and found that these could be used to reconstitute it. The new component was what is now known as hydrogen cyanide. It was subsequently prepared from Prussian blue by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1782, and was eventually given the German name &quot;Blausäure&quot; (&quot;lit&quot;. &quot;Blue acid&quot;) because of its acidic nature in water and its derivation from Prussian blue. In English, it became known popularly as &quot;prussic acid.&quot;

In 1787, the French chemist Claude Louis Berthollet showed that prussic acid did not contain oxygen, an important contribution to acid theory, which had hitherto postulated that acids must contain oxygen (hence the name of oxygen itself, which is derived from Greek elements that mean &quot;acid-former&quot; and are likewise calqued into German as &quot;Sauerstoff&quot;).

In 1811, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac prepared pure, liquified hydrogen cyanide, and in 1815 he deduced Prussic acid&#x27;s chemical formula.

===Etymology===
The word &quot;cyanide&quot; for the radical in hydrogen cyanide was derived from its French equivalent, &quot;cyanure&quot;, which Gay-Lussac constructed from the Ancient Greek word &quot;κύανος&quot; for dark blue enamel or lapis lazuli, again owing to the chemical’s derivation from Prussian blue. Incidentally, the Greek word is also the root of the English color name &quot;cyan&quot;.

==Production and synthesis==
The most important process is the Andrussow oxidation invented by Leonid Andrussow at IG Farben in which methane and ammonia react in the presence of oxygen at about over a platinum catalyst:
In 2006, between 500 million and 1 billion pounds (between 230,000 and 450,000 t) were produced in the US. Hydrogen cyanide is produced in large quantities by several processes and is a recovered waste product from the manufacture of acrylonitrile.

Of lesser importance is the Degussa process (BMA process) in which no oxygen is added and the energy must be transferred indirectly through the reactor wall:
This reaction is akin to steam reforming, the reaction of methane and water to give carbon monoxide and hydrogen.

In the Shawinigan Process, hydrocarbons, e.g. propane, are reacted with ammonia.

In the laboratory, small amounts of HCN are produced by the addition of acids to cyanide salts of alkali metals:
This reaction is sometimes the basis of accidental poisonings because the acid converts a nonvolatile cyanide salt into the gaseous HCN.

Hydrogen cyanide could be obtained from potassium ferricyanide and acid:

===Historical methods of production===
The large demand for cyanides for mining operations in the 1890s was met by George Thomas Beilby, who patented a method to produce hydrogen cyanide by passing ammonia over glowing coal in 1892. This method was used until Hamilton Castner in 1894 developed a synthesis starting from coal, ammonia, and sodium yielding sodium cyanide, which reacts with acid to form gaseous HCN.

==Applications==
HCN is the precursor to sodium cyanide and potassium cyanide, which are used mainly in gold and silver mining and for the electroplating of those metals. Via the intermediacy of cyanohydrins, a variety of useful organic compounds are prepared from HCN including the monomer methyl methacrylate, from acetone, the amino acid methionine, via the Strecker synthesis, and the chelating agents EDTA and NTA. Via the hydrocyanation process, HCN is added to butadiene to give adiponitrile, a precursor to Nylon-6,6.

HCN is used globally as a fumigant against many species of pest insects that infest food production facilities. Both its efficacy and method of application lead to very small amounts of the fumigant being used compared to other toxic substances used for the same purpose. Using HCN as a fumigant also has less environmental impact, compared to some other fumigants such as sulfuryl fluoride, and methyl bromide.

==Occurrence==
HCN is obtainable from fruits that have a pit, such as cherries, apricots, apples, and nuts such as bitter almonds, from which almond oil and extract is made. Many of these pits contain small amounts of cyanohydrins such as mandelonitrile and amygdalin, which slowly release hydrogen cyanide. One hundred grams of crushed apple seeds can yield about 70 mg of HCN. The roots of cassava plants contain cyanogenic glycosides such as linamarin, which decompose into HCN in yields of up to 370 mg per kilogram of fresh root. Some millipedes, such as &quot;Harpaphe haydeniana&quot;, &quot;Desmoxytes purpurosea&quot;, and &quot;Apheloria&quot; release hydrogen cyanide as a defense mechanism, as do certain insects, such as burnet moths and the larvae of &quot;Paropsisterna eucalyptus&quot;. Hydrogen cyanide is contained in the exhaust of vehicles, and in smoke from burning nitrogen-containing plastics.

=== On Titan ===
HCN has been measured in Titan&#x27;s atmosphere by four instruments on the Cassini space probe, one instrument on Voyager, and one instrument on Earth. One of these measurements was &quot;in situ&quot;, where the Cassini spacecraft dipped between above Titan&#x27;s surface to collect atmospheric gas for mass spectrometry analysis. HCN initially forms in Titan&#x27;s atmosphere through the reaction of photochemically produced methane and nitrogen radicals which proceed through the H2CN intermediate, e.g., (CH3 + N → H2CN + H → HCN + H2). Ultraviolet radiation breaks HCN up into CN + H; however, CN is efficiently recycled back into HCN via the reaction CN + CH4 → HCN + CH3.

=== On the young Earth ===
It has been postulated that carbon from a cascade of asteroids (known as the Late Heavy Bombardment), resulting from interaction of Jupiter and Saturn, blasted the surface of young Earth and reacted with nitrogen in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere to form HCN.

=== In mammals ===
Some authors have shown that neurons can produce hydrogen cyanide upon activation of their opioid receptors by endogenous or exogenous opioids. They have also shown that neuronal production of HCN activates NMDA receptors and plays a role in signal transduction between neuronal cells (neurotransmission). Moreover, increased endogenous neuronal HCN production under opioids was seemingly needed for adequate opioid analgesia, as analgesic action of opioids was attenuated by HCN scavengers. They considered endogenous HCN to be a neuromodulator.

It has also been shown that, while stimulating muscarinic cholinergic receptors in cultured pheochromocytoma cells &quot;increases&quot; HCN production, in a living organism (&quot;in vivo&quot;) muscarinic cholinergic stimulation actually &quot;decreases&quot; HCN production.

Leukocytes generate HCN during phagocytosis, and can kill bacteria, fungi, and other pathogens by generating several different toxic chemicals, one of which is hydrogen cyanide.

The vasodilatation caused by sodium nitroprusside has been shown to be mediated not only by NO generation, but also by endogenous cyanide generation, which adds not only toxicity, but also some additional antihypertensive efficacy compared to nitroglycerine and other non-cyanogenic nitrates which do not cause blood cyanide levels to rise.

HCN is a constituent of tobacco smoke.

===HCN and the origin of life===
Hydrogen cyanide has been discussed as a precursor to amino acids and nucleic acids, and is proposed to have played a part in the origin of life. Although the relationship of these chemical reactions to the origin of life theory remains speculative, studies in this area have led to discoveries of new pathways to organic compounds derived from the condensation of HCN (e.g. Adenine). That&#x27;s why scientists who search for life on planets beyond Earth, the primary factors they examine, after confirming suitable temperatures and the presence of water, are molecules like hydrogen cyanide.

===In space===

HCN has been detected in the interstellar medium and in the atmospheres of carbon stars. Since then, extensive studies have probed formation and destruction pathways of HCN in various environments and examined its use as a tracer for a variety of astronomical species and processes. HCN can be observed from ground-based telescopes through a number of atmospheric windows. The J=1→0, J=3→2, J= 4→3, and J=10→9 pure rotational transitions have all been observed.

HCN is formed in interstellar clouds through one of two major pathways: via a neutral-neutral reaction (CH2 + N → HCN + H) and via dissociative recombination (HCNH+ + e− → HCN + H). The dissociative recombination pathway is dominant by 30%; however, the HCNH+ must be in its linear form. Dissociative recombination with its structural isomer, H2NC+, exclusively produces hydrogen isocyanide (HNC).

HCN is destroyed in interstellar clouds through a number of mechanisms depending on the location in the cloud. In photon-dominated regions (PDRs), photodissociation dominates, producing CN (HCN + ν → CN + H). At further depths, photodissociation by cosmic rays dominate, producing CN (HCN + cr → CN + H). In the dark core, two competing mechanisms destroy it, forming HCN+ and HCNH+ (HCN + H+ → HCN+ + H; HCN + HCO+ → HCNH+ + CO). The reaction with HCO+ dominates by a factor of ~3.5. HCN has been used to analyze a variety of species and processes in the interstellar medium. It has been suggested as a tracer for dense molecular gas and as a tracer of stellar inflow in high-mass star-forming regions. Further, the HNC/HCN ratio has been shown to be an excellent method for distinguishing between PDRs and X-ray-dominated regions (XDRs).

On 11 August 2014, astronomers released studies, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) for the first time, that detailed the distribution of HCN, HNC, H2CO, and dust inside the comae of comets C/2012 F6 (Lemmon) and C/2012 S1 (ISON).

In February 2016, it was announced that traces of hydrogen cyanide were found in the atmosphere of the hot Super-Earth 55 Cancri e with NASA&#x27;s Hubble Space Telescope.

On 14 December 2023, astronomers reported the first time discovery, in the plumes of Enceladus, moon of the planet Saturn, of hydrogen cyanide, a possible chemical essential for life as we know it, as well as other organic molecules, some of which are yet to be better identified and understood. According to the researchers, &quot;these [newly discovered] compounds could potentially support extant microbial communities or drive complex organic synthesis leading to the origin of life.&quot;

==As a poison and chemical weapon==

In World War I, hydrogen cyanide was used by the French from 1916 as a chemical weapon against the Central Powers, and by the United States and Italy in 1918. It was not found to be effective enough due to weather conditions. The gas is lighter than air and rapidly disperses up into the atmosphere. Rapid dilution made its use in the field impractical. In contrast, denser agents such as phosgene or chlorine tended to remain at ground level and sank into the trenches of the Western Front&#x27;s battlefields. Compared to such agents, hydrogen cyanide had to be present in higher concentrations in order to be fatal.

A hydrogen cyanide concentration of 100–200 ppm in breathing air will kill a human within 10 to 60 minutes. A hydrogen cyanide concentration of 2000 ppm (about 2380 mg/m3) will kill a human in about one minute. The toxic effect is caused by the action of the cyanide ion, which halts cellular respiration. It acts as a non-competitive inhibitor for an enzyme in mitochondria called cytochrome c oxidase. As such, hydrogen cyanide is commonly listed among chemical weapons as a blood agent.

The Chemical Weapons Convention lists it under Schedule 3 as a potential weapon which has large-scale industrial uses. Signatory countries must declare manufacturing plants that produce more than 30 metric tons per year, and allow inspection by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

Perhaps its most infamous use is (German: &quot;Cyclone B&quot;, with the B standing for – prussic acid; also, to distinguish it from an earlier product later known as Zyklon A), used in the Nazi German extermination camps of Majdanek and Auschwitz-Birkenau during World War II to kill Jews and other persecuted minorities &quot;en masse&quot; as part of their Final Solution genocide program. Hydrogen cyanide was also used in the camps for delousing clothing in attempts to eradicate diseases carried by lice and other parasites. One of the original Czech producers continued making Zyklon B under the trademark &quot;Uragan D2&quot; until around 2015.

During World War II, the US considered using it, along with cyanogen chloride, as part of Operation Downfall, the planned invasion of Japan, but President Harry Truman decided against it, instead using the atomic bombs developed by the secret Manhattan Project.

Hydrogen cyanide was also the agent employed in judicial execution in some U.S. states, where it was produced during the execution by the action of sulfuric acid on sodium cyanide or potassium cyanide.

Under the name &quot;prussic acid&quot;, HCN has been used as a killing agent in whaling harpoons, although it proved quite dangerous to the crew deploying it, and it was quickly abandoned. From the middle of the 18th century it was used in a number of poisoning murders and suicides.

Hydrogen cyanide gas in air is explosive at concentrations above 5.6%.

<text>Potassium hexacyanidoferrate(II) is the inorganic compound with formula K4[Fe(CN)6]·3H2O. It is the potassium salt of the coordination complex [Fe(CN)6]4−. This salt forms lemon-yellow monoclinic crystals.

==Synthesis==

In 1752, the French chemist Pierre Joseph Macquer (1718–1784) first reported the preparation of Potassium hexacyanidoferrate(II), which he achieved by reacting Prussian blue (iron(III) ferrocyanide) with potassium hydroxide.

===Modern production===
Potassium hexacyanidoferrate(II) is produced industrially from hydrogen cyanide, iron(II) chloride, and calcium hydroxide, the combination of which affords Ca2[Fe(CN)6]·11H2O. This solution is then treated with potassium salts to precipitate the mixed calcium-potassium salt CaK2[Fe(CN)6], which in turn is treated with potassium carbonate to give the tetrapotassium salt.

===Historical production===
Historically, the compound was manufactured from nitrogenous organic material, iron filings, and potassium carbonate. Common nitrogen and carbon sources were torrified horn, leather scrap, offal, or dried blood. It was also obtained commercially from gasworks spent oxide (purification of city gas from hydrogen cyanide).

==Chemical reactions==
Treatment of potassium hexacyanidoferrate(II) with nitric acid gives H2[Fe(NO)(CN)5]. After neutralization of this intermediate with sodium carbonate, red crystals of sodium nitroprusside can be selectively crystallized.

Upon treatment with chlorine gas, potassium hexacyanidoferrate(II) converts to potassium hexacyanidoferrate(III):
:2 K4[Fe(CN)6] + Cl2 → 2 K3[Fe(CN)6] + 2 KCl
This reaction can be used to remove potassium hexacyanidoferrate(II) from a solution.

A famous reaction involves treatment with ferric salts, most commonly Iron(III) chloride, to give Prussian blue. In the reaction with Iron(III) chloride, producing Potassium chloride as a side-product: 

3 K4[Fe(CN)6] + 4 FeCl3 → Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3 + 12 KCl

With the composition Fe[Fe(CN)], this insoluble but deeply coloured material is the blue of blueprinting, as well as on many famous paintings such as The Great Wave off Kanagawa and The Starry Night.

==Applications==
Potassium hexacyanidoferrate(II) finds many niche applications in industry. It and the related sodium salt are widely used as anticaking agents for both road salt and table salt. The potassium and sodium hexacyanidoferrates(II) are also used in the purification of tin and the separation of copper from molybdenum ores. Potassium hexacyanidoferrate(II) is used in the production of wine and citric acid.

In the EU, hexacyanidoferrates(II) (E 535–538) were, as of 2017, solely authorised in two food categories as salt additives.

It can also be used in animal feed.

In the laboratory, potassium hexacyanidoferrate(II) is used to determine the concentration of potassium permanganate, a compound often used in titrations based on redox reactions. Potassium hexacyanidoferrate(II) is used in a mixture with potassium ferricyanide and phosphate buffered solution to provide a buffer for beta-galactosidase, which is used to cleave X-Gal, giving a bright blue visualization where an antibody (or other molecule), conjugated to Beta-gal, has bonded to its target. On reacting with Fe(3) it gives a Prussian blue colour. Thus it is used as an identifying reagent for iron in labs.

Potassium hexacyanidoferrate(II) can be used as a fertilizer for plants.

Prior to 1900, before the invention of the Castner process, potassium hexacyanidoferrate(II) was the most important source of alkali metal cyanides. In this historical process, potassium cyanide was produced by decomposing potassium hexacyanidoferrate(II):

K4[Fe(CN)6] → 4 KCN + FeC2 + N2

==Structure==
Like other metal cyanides, solid potassium hexacyanidoferrate(II), both as the hydrate and anhydrous salts, has a complicated polymeric structure. The polymer consists of octahedral [Fe(CN)6]4− centers crosslinked with K+ ions that are bound to the CN ligands. The K+---NC linkages break when the solid is dissolved in water.

===Toxicity===
The toxicity in rats is low, with lethal dose (LD50) at 6400 mg/kg. The kidneys are the organ for ferrocyanide toxicity.

<text>The Atlantic cod (: cod; Gadus morhua) is a fish of the family Gadidae, widely consumed by humans. It is also commercially known as &quot;cod&quot; or &quot;codling&quot;.

In the western Atlantic Ocean, cod has a distribution north of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and around both coasts of Greenland and the Labrador Sea; in the eastern Atlantic, it is found from the Bay of Biscay north to the Arctic Ocean, including the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, Sea of the Hebrides, areas around Iceland and the Barents Sea.

Atlantic cod can live for up to 25 years and typically grow up to , but individuals in excess of and have been caught. They will attain sexual maturity between ages two and eight with this varying between populations and has varied over time.

Colouring is brown or green, with spots on the dorsal side, shading to silver ventrally. A stripe along its lateral line (used to detect vibrations) is clearly visible. Its habitat ranges from the coastal shoreline down to along the continental shelf.

Atlantic cod is one of the most heavily fished species. Atlantic cod was fished for a thousand years by north European fishers who followed it across the North Atlantic Ocean to North America. It supported the US and Canada fishing economy until 1992, when the Canadian Government implemented a ban on fishing cod.
Several cod stocks collapsed in the 1990s (decline of more than 95% of maximum historical biomass) and have failed to fully recover even with the cessation of fishing. This absence of the apex predator has led to a trophic cascade in many areas. Many other cod stocks remain at risk. The Atlantic cod is labelled vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, per a 1996 assessment that the IUCN notes needs updating. A 2013 assessment covering only Europe shows the Atlantic cod has rebounded in Europe, and it has been relabelled least concern.

Dry cod may be prepared as unsalted stockfish, and as cured salt cod or clipfish.

==Taxonomy==
The Atlantic cod is one of three cod species in the genus &quot;Gadus &quot;along with Pacific cod and Greenland cod. A variety of fish species are colloquially known as cod, but they are not all classified within the &quot;Gadus&quot;, though some are in the Atlantic cod family, Gadidae.

==Behaviour==

===Shoaling===
Atlantic cod are a shoaling species and move in large, size-structured aggregations. Larger fish act as scouts and lead the shoal&#x27;s direction, particularly during post spawning migrations inshore for feeding. Cod actively feed during migration and changes in shoal structure occur when food is encountered. Shoals are generally thought to be relatively leaderless, with all fish having equal status and an equal distribution of resources and benefits. However, some studies suggest that leading fish gain certain feeding benefits. One study of a migrating Atlantic cod shoal showed significant variability in feeding habits based on size and position in the shoal. Larger scouts consumed a more variable, higher quantity of food, while trailing fish had less variable diets and consumed less food. Fish distribution throughout the shoal seems to be dictated by fish size, and ultimately, the smaller lagging fish likely benefit from shoaling because they are more successful in feeding in the shoal than they would be if migrating individually, due to social facilitation.

===Predation===
Atlantic cod are apex predators in the Baltic and adults are generally free from the concerns of predation. Juvenile cod, however, may serve as prey for adult cod, which sometimes practice cannibalism. Juvenile cod make substrate decisions based on risk of predation. Substrates refer to different feeding and swimming environments. Without apparent risk of predation, juvenile cod demonstrated a preference for finer-grained substrates such as sand and gravel-pebble. However, in the presence of a predator, they preferred to seek safety in the space available between stones of a cobble substrate. Selection of cobble significantly reduces the risk of predation. Without access to cobble, the juvenile cod simply tries to escape a predator by fleeing.

Additionally, juvenile Atlantic cod vary their behaviour according to the foraging behaviour of predators. In the vicinity of a passive predator, cod behaviour changes very little. The juveniles prefer finer-grained substrates and otherwise avoid the safer kelp, steering clear of the predator. In contrast, in the presence of an actively foraging predator, juveniles are highly avoidant and hide in cobble or in kelp if cobble is unavailable.

Heavy fishing of cod in the 1990s and the collapse of American and Canadian cod stocks resulted in trophic cascades. As cod are apex predators, overfishing them removed a significant predatory pressure on other Atlantic fish and crustacean species. Population-limiting effects on several species including American lobsters, crabs, and shrimp from cod predation have decreased significantly, and the abundance of these species and their increasing range serve as evidence of the Atlantic cod&#x27;s role as a major predator rather than prey.

===Swimming===
Atlantic cod have been recorded to swim at speeds of a minimum of and a maximum of with a mean swimming speed of . In one hour, cod have been recorded to cover a mean range of . Swimming speed was higher during the day than at night. This is reflected in the fact that cod more actively search for food during the day. Cod likely modify their activity pattern according to the length of daylight, thus activity varies with time of year.

===Response to changing temperatures===
Swimming and physiological behaviours change in response to fluctuations in water temperature. Respirometry experiments show that heart rates of Atlantic cod change drastically with changes in temperature of only a few degrees. A rise in water temperature causes marked increases in cod swimming activity. Cod typically avoid new temperature conditions, and the temperatures can dictate where they are distributed in water. They prefer to be deeper, in colder water layers during the day, and in shallower, warmer water layers at night. These fine-tuned behavioural changes to water temperature are driven by an effort to maintain homeostasis to preserve energy. This is demonstrated by the fact that a decrease of only caused a highly costly increase in metabolic rate of 15–30%.

==Feeding and diet==
The diet of the Atlantic cod consists of fish such as herring, capelin (in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean), and sand eels, as well as mollusks, tunicates, comb jellies, crustaceans, echinoderms and sea worms. Stomach sampling studies have discovered that small Atlantic cod feed primarily on crustaceans, while large Atlantic cod feed primarily on fish. In certain regions, the main food source is decapods with fish as a complementary food item in the diet. Wild Atlantic cod throughout the North Sea depend, to a large extent, on commercial fish species also used in fisheries, such as Atlantic mackerel, haddock, whiting, Atlantic herring, European plaice, and common sole, making fishery manipulation of cod significantly easier. Ultimately, food selection by cod is affected by the food item size relative to their own size. However, providing for size, cod do exhibit food preference and are not simply driven by availability.

Atlantic cod practice some cannibalism. In the southern North Sea, 1–2% (by weight) of stomach contents for cod larger than consisted of juvenile cod. In the northern North Sea, cannibalism was higher, at 10%. Other reports of cannibalism have estimated as high as 56% of the diet consists of juvenile cod.

When hatched, cod larvae are altricial, entirely dependent on a yolk sac for sustenance until mouth opening at ~24 degree days. The stomach generally develops at around 240 degree days. Before this point the intestine is the main point of food digestion using pancreatic enzymes such as trypsin.

==Reproduction==

Atlantic cod will attain sexual maturity between ages two and eight with this varying between different populations and has also varied over time with a population. Their gonads take several months to develop and most populations will spawn from January to May. For many populations, the spawning grounds are located in a different area than the feeding grounds so require the fish to migrate in order to spawn. On the spawning area, males and females will form large schools. Based on behavioral observations of cod, the cod mating system has been likened to a lekking system, which is characterized by males aggregating and establishing dominance hierarchies, at which point females may visit and choose a spawning partner based on status and sexual characteristics. Evidence suggests male sound production and other sexually selected characteristics allow female cod to actively choose a spawning partner. Males also exhibit aggressive interactions for access to females.

Atlantic cod are batch spawners, in which females will spawn approximately 5–20 batches of eggs over a period of time with 2–4 days between the release of each batch. Each female will spawn between 2 hundred thousand and 15 million eggs, with larger females spawning more eggs. Females release gametes in a ventral mount, and males then fertilize the released eggs. The eggs and newly hatched larvae float freely in the water and will drift with the current, with some populations relying upon the current to transport the larvae to nursery areas.

== Parasites ==
Atlantic cod act as intermediate, paratenic, or definitive hosts to a large number of parasite species: 107 taxa listed by Hemmingsen and MacKenzie (2001) and seven new records by Perdiguero-Alonso et al. (2008). The predominant groups of cod parasites in the northeast Atlantic were trematodes (19 species) and nematodes (13 species), including larval anisakids, which comprised 58.2% of the total number of individuals. Parasites of Atlantic cod include copepods, digeneans, monogeneans, acanthocephalans, cestodes, nematodes, myxozoans, and protozoans.

== Fisheries ==
Atlantic cod has been targeted by humans for food for thousands of years, and with the advent of modern fishing technology in the 1950s there was a rapid rise in landings. Cod is caught using a variety of fishing gears including bottom trawls, demersal longlines, Danish seine, jigging and hand lines. The quantity of cod landed from fisheries has been recorded by many countries from around the 1950s and attempts have been made to reconstruct historical catches going back hundreds of years. ICES and NAFO collects landings data, alongside other data, which is used to assess the status of the population against management objectives. The landings in the eastern Atlantic frequently exceeds 1 million tonnes annually from across 16 populations/management units with landings from the Northeast Atlantic cod population and Iceland accounting for the majority of the landings, Since 1992, when the cod moratorium took effect in Canada, landings in the western Atlantic have been considerably lower than in the eastern Atlantic, generally being less than 50,000 tonnes annually.

===Northwest Atlantic cod===
The Northwest Atlantic cod has been regarded as heavily overfished throughout its range, resulting in a crash in the fishery in the United States and Canada during the early 1990s.

Newfoundland&#x27;s northern cod fishery can be traced back to the 16th century. On average, about of cod were landed annually until the 1960s, when advances in technology enabled factory trawlers to take larger catches. By 1968, landings for the fish peaked at before a gradual decline set in. With the reopening of the limited cod fisheries in 2006, nearly of cod were hauled in. In 2007, offshore cod stocks were estimated at 1% of what they were in 1977.Technologies that contributed to the collapse of Atlantic cod include engine-powered vessels and frozen food compartments aboard ships. Engine-powered vessels had larger nets, greater range, and better navigation. The capacity to catch fish became limitless. In addition, sonar technology gave an edge to detecting and catching fish. Sonar was originally developed during World War II to locate enemy submarines, but was later applied to locating schools of fish. These new technologies, as well as bottom trawlers that destroyed entire ecosystems, contributed to the collapse of Atlantic cod. They were vastly different from old techniques used, such as hand lines and long lines.

The fishery has only recently begun to recover, and may never fully recover because of a possibly stable change in the food chain. Atlantic cod was a top-tier predator, along with haddock, flounder and hake, feeding upon smaller prey, such as herring, capelin, shrimp, and snow crab. With the large predatory fish removed, their prey have had population explosions and have become the top predators, affecting the survival rates of cod eggs and fry.

In the winter of 2011–2012, the cod fishery succeeded in convincing NOAA to postpone for one year the planned 82% reduction in catch limits. Instead, the limit was reduced by 22%. The fishery brought in $15.8 million in 2010, coming second behind Georges Bank haddock among the region&#x27;s 20 regulated bottom-dwelling groundfish. Data released in 2011 indicated that even closing the fishery would not allow populations to rebound by 2014 to levels required under US federal law. Restrictions on cod effectively limit fishing on other groundfish species with which the cod swim, such as flounder and haddock.

===Northeast Atlantic cod===

The Northeast Atlantic has the world&#x27;s largest population of cod. By far, the largest part of this population is the Northeast Arctic cod, as it is labelled by the ICES, or the Arcto-Norwegian cod stock, also referred to as &quot;skrei&quot;, a Norwegian name meaning something like &quot;the wanderer&quot;, distinguishing it from coastal cod. The Northeast Arctic cod is found in the Barents Sea area. This stock spawns in March and April along the Norwegian coast, about 40% around the Lofoten archipelago. Newly hatched larvae drift northwards with the coastal current while feeding on larval copepods. By summer, the young cod reach the Barents Sea, where they stay for the rest of their lives, until their spawning migration. As the cod grow, they feed on krill and other small crustaceans and fish. Adult cod primarily feed on fish such as capelin and herring. The northeast Arctic cod also show cannibalistic behaviour. Estimated stock size was in 2008.

The North Sea cod stock is primarily fished by European Union member states, the United Kingdom and Norway. In 1999, the catch was divided among Denmark (31%), Scotland (25%), the rest of the United Kingdom (12%), the Netherlands (10%), Belgium, Germany and Norway (17%). In the 1970s, the annual catch rose to between . Due to concerns about overfishing, catch quotas were repeatedly reduced in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2003, ICES stated a high risk existed of stock collapse if then current exploitation levels continued, and recommended a moratorium on catching Atlantic cod in the North Sea during 2004. However, agriculture and fisheries ministers from the Council of the European Union endorsed the EU/Norway Agreement and set the total allowable catch at . Seafood sustainability guides, such as the Monterey Bay Aquarium&#x27;s Seafood Watch, often recommend environmentally conscious customers not purchase Atlantic cod.

The stock of Northeast Arctic cod was more than four million tons following World War II, but declined to a historic minimum of in 1983. The catch reached a historic maximum of in 1956, and bottomed out at in 1990. Since 2000, the spawning stock has increased quite quickly, helped by low fishing pressure. The total catch in 2012 was , the major fishers being Norway and Russia.

=== Baltic cod ===
Decades of overfishing in combination with environmental problems, namely little water exchange, low salinity and oxygen-depletion at the sea bottom, caused major threats to the Baltic cod stocks.

There are at least two populations of cod in the Baltic Sea: One large population that spawns east of Bornholm and one population spawning west of Bornholm. Eastern Baltic cod is genetically distinct and adapted to the brackish environment. Adaptations include differences in hemoglobin type, osmoregulatory capacity, egg buoyancy, sperm swimming characteristics and spawning season. The adaptive responses to the environmental conditions in the Baltic Sea may contribute to an effective reproductive barrier, and thus, eastern Baltic cod can be viewed as an example of ongoing speciation. Due to drastically low cod population sizes, commercial fishing of eastern Baltic cod is prohibited since 2019. However, unfavourable environmental conditions in the eastern Baltic Sea, i.e., low salinity and increasing oxygen-depletion at the sea bottom, led to presently only the Bornholm Basin (Southern Baltic Sea) having sufficient conditions for successful reproduction of eastern Baltic cod.

The western Baltic cod consists of one or several small subpopulations that are genetically more similar to the North Sea cod. In the Arkona basin (located off Cape Arkona, Rügen), spawning and migrating cod from both the eastern and western stocks intermingle in proportions that vary seasonally. The immigration of eastern cod into the western Baltic management unit may mask a poor state of the populations in the western management unit.

<text>The wheel of time or wheel of history (also known as &quot;Kalachakra&quot;) is a concept found in several religious traditions and philosophies, notably religions of Indian origin such as Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, and Buddhism, which regard time as cyclical and consisting of repeating ages. Many other cultures contain belief in a similar concept: notably, the Q&#x27;ero people of Peru, the Hopi people of Arizona, and the Bakongo people of Angola and Democratic Republic of the Congo.

== Ancient Africa ==
In traditional Bakongo religion, the four elements are incorporated into the Kongo cosmogram. This sacred wheel depicts the physical world (&quot;Nseke&quot;), the spiritual world of the ancestors (&quot;Mpémba&quot;), the Kalûnga line that runs between the two worlds, the sacred river (&quot;mbûngi&quot;) that began as a circular void and forms a circle around the two worlds, and the path of the sun. Each element correlates to a period in the life cycle, which the Bakongo people also equate to the four cardinal directions and seasons. According to their cosmology, all living things go through this cycle.

* Mbûngi represents &quot;aether&quot; and is the void that exists before creation.
* Musoni time (South) represents &quot;air&quot; and is the period of conception that takes place during spring.
* Kala time (East) represent &quot;fire&quot; and is the period of birth that takes place during summer.
* Tukula time (North) represents &quot;earth&quot; and is the period of maturity that takes place during fall.
* Luvemba time (West) represents &quot;water&quot; and is the period of death that takes place during winter.

==Ancient Rome==
The philosopher and emperor Marcus Aurelius saw time as extending forwards to infinity and backwards to infinity, while admitting the possibility (without arguing the case) that &quot;the administration of the universe is organized into a succession of finite periods&quot;.

==Buddhism==
The Wheel of Time or Kalachakra is a Tantric deity that is associated with Tibetan Tantric Buddhism, which encompasses all four main schools of Sakya, Nyingma, Kagyu and Gelug, and is especially important within the lesser-known Jonang tradition.

The Kalachakra tantra prophesies a world within which (religious) conflict is prevalent. A worldwide war will be waged which will see the expansion of the mystical Kingdom of Shambhala led by a messianic king.
==Hinduism==
In Hindu cosmology, &quot;kala&quot; (time) is eternal, repeating general events in four types of cycles. The smallest cycle is a &quot;maha-yuga&quot; (great age), containing four &quot;yugas&quot; (&quot;dharmic&quot; ages): &quot;Satya Yuga&quot;, &quot;Treta Yuga&quot;, &quot;Dvapara Yuga&quot; and &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;. A &quot;manvantara&quot; (age of Manu) contains 71 &quot;maha-yugas&quot;. A &quot;kalpa&quot; (day of Brahma) contains 14 &quot;manvantaras&quot; and 15 &quot;sandhyas&quot; (connecting periods), which lasts for 1,000 &quot;maha-yugas&quot; and is followed by a &quot;pralaya&quot; (night of partial dissolution) of equal length, where a day and night make one full day. A &quot;maha-kalpa&quot; (life of Brahma) lasts for 100 of Brahma&#x27;s years of 12 months of 30 full days (100 360-day years) or 72,000,000 &quot;maha-yugas&quot;, which is followed by a &quot;maha-pralaya&quot; (full dissolution) of equal length.

==Jainism==
Within Jainism, time is thought to be a wheel that rotates for infinity without a beginning. This wheel of time holds twelve spokes that each symbolize a different phase in the universe&#x27;s cosmological history. It is further divided into two equal halves having six eras in them. While in a downward motion, the wheel of time falls into what is known as Avasarpiṇī and when in an upward motion, enters a state called Utsarpini. During both motions of the wheel, 24 tirthankaras come forth to teach the three jewels or sacred Jain teachings of right faith, right knowledge, and right practice, then create a spiritual ford across the ocean of rebirth for humanity.

==Modern usage==
===Literature===
In an interview included with the audiobook editions of his novels, author Robert Jordan has stated that his bestselling fantasy series &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; borrows the titular concept from Hindu mythology.

The first chapter of every book in the series begins with the lines: &quot;The Wheel of Time turns, and ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legends fade to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again.&quot; 

===Television===
*Several episodes of the American TV series &quot;Lost&quot; feature a wheel that can be physically turned in order to manipulate space and time. In a series of episodes during the fifth season, the island on which the show takes place begins to skip violently back and forth through time after the wheel is pulled off its axis.

*The character Rust Cohle in the first season of True Detective makes numerous references to his belief that events in time repeat, claiming that &quot;Time is a flat circle&quot;.

<text>William Clark Gable (February 1, 1901November 16, 1960) was an American film actor. Often referred to as the &quot;King of Hollywood&quot;, he had roles in more than 60 films in a variety of genres during a career that lasted 37 years, for three decades of which he was a leading man. He was named the seventh greatest male movie star of classic American cinema by the American Film Institute.

Gable won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in the romantic comedy, &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934). He was further Oscar-nominated for his roles as Fletcher Christian in the drama &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1935), and Rhett Butler in the historical romance drama &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939). He received Golden Globe Award nominations for his comedic roles in &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot; (1958), and &quot;But Not for Me&quot; (1959). He also starred in &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; (1935), &quot;Key to the City&quot; (1950), and &quot;Mogambo&quot; (1953). His final on-screen role was as an aging cowboy in &quot;The Misfits&quot; (1961).

Gable was one of the most consistent box-office performers in the history of Hollywood, appearing on Quigley Publishing&#x27;s annual Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll sixteen times. He appeared opposite many of the most popular actresses of their time. He frequently acted alongside Joan Crawford, Myrna Loy, Jean Harlow, Lana Turner, Norma Shearer and Ava Gardner. Gable died of a heart attack in 1960 at the age of 59.

== Early life ==
=== 1901–1919: Family and upbringing ===

William Clark Gable was born on February 1, 1901, in Cadiz, Ohio, to William Henry &quot;Will&quot; Gable (1870–1948), an oil-well driller, and his wife Adeline ( Hershelman). His father was a Protestant and his mother a Catholic. Gable was named William after his father, but he was almost always called Clark, and referred to as &quot;the kid&quot; by his father.
Gable was six months old when he was baptized at a Roman Catholic church in Dennison, Ohio. When he was ten months old, his mother died. His father refused to raise him in the Catholic faith, which provoked criticism from the Hershelman family. Gable and his father were active in the Methodist church where his father was a Sunday School teacher. The dispute was resolved when his father agreed to allow him to spend time with his maternal uncle Charles Hershelman and his wife on their farm in Vernon Township, Pennsylvania. In April 1903, Gable&#x27;s father married Jennie Dunlap (1874–1920).

Gable&#x27;s stepmother raised the tall, shy child with a loud voice to be well-dressed and well-groomed. She played the piano and gave him lessons at home. He later took up brass instruments, becoming the only boy in the Hopedale Men&#x27;s town band at age 13. Gable was mechanically inclined and loved to repair cars with his father, who insisted that he engage in masculine activities such as hunting and hard physical work. Gable also loved literature; he would recite Shakespeare among trusted company, particularly the sonnets.

His father had financial difficulties in 1917 and decided to try his hand at farming, and moved the family to Palmyra Township, near Akron, Ohio. His father insisted that he work the farm, but Gable soon left to work in Akron for the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company.

=== 1920–1923: Early career ===
Gable was inspired to become an actor after seeing the play &quot;The Bird of Paradise&quot; at age 17, but he was unable to make a start in acting until he turned 21 and received his $300 inheritance () from a Hershelman trust. After his stepmother died in 1920, his father moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, going back into the oil business. He worked with his father for some time wildcatting and sludge removing in the oil fields of Oklahoma before traveling to the Pacific Northwest.

Gable toured in second-class stock companies, finding work with traveling tent shows, lumber mills, and other odd jobs. He made his way across the Midwest to Portland, Oregon, where he worked as a necktie salesman in the Meier &amp; Frank department store. Also working there was local stage actor Earle Larimore, (the nephew of Laura Hope Crews who portrayed Aunt Pittypat alongside Gable in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;) who encouraged Gable to return to acting. Though Larimore didn&#x27;t invite him to join his theater group The Red Lantern Players, he did introduce Gable to one of its members, Franz Dorfler, and they started dating. After the couple&#x27;s audition for The Astoria Players, Gable&#x27;s lack of training was evident, but the theater group accepted him after cajoling from Larimore. Gable and Dorfler moved to Astoria, Oregon, touring with the group until its bankruptcy, and then moved back to Portland where Gable obtained a day job with Pacific Telephone and started receiving dramatic lessons in the evening.

Gable&#x27;s acting coach, Josephine Dillon, was a theater manager in Portland. She paid to have his teeth fixed and his hair styled. She guided him in building up his chronically undernourished body, and taught him better body control and posture. He slowly managed to lower his naturally high-pitched voice, his speech habits improved, and his facial expressions became more natural and convincing. After a long period of her training, Dillon considered Gable ready to attempt a film career.

== Career ==
=== 1924–1930: Stage and silent films ===

Gable and Dillon traveled to Hollywood in 1924. Dillon became his manager and also his wife; she was 17 years his senior. He changed his stage name from W. C. Gable to Clark Gable and appeared as an extra in such silent films as Erich von Stroheim&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; (1925), &quot;The Plastic Age&quot; (1925) starring Clara Bow, and &quot;Forbidden Paradise&quot; (1924) starring Pola Negri. He appeared in a series of two-reel comedies called &quot;The Pacemakers&quot; and in Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Johnstown Flood&quot; (1926). He also appeared as a bit player in a series of shorts. However, he was not offered any major film roles, so he returned to the stage in &quot;What Price Glory?&quot; (1925).

He became lifelong friends with Lionel Barrymore, who initially scolded Gable for what he deemed amateurish acting but nevertheless urged him to pursue a stage career. During the 1927–28 theater season, he acted with the Laskin Brothers Stock Company in Houston, Texas; while there, he played many roles, gained considerable experience, and became a local matinee idol. He then moved to New York City, where Dillon sought work for him on Broadway. He received good reviews in &quot;Machinal&quot; (1928), with one critic describing him as &quot;young, vigorous, and brutally masculine&quot;.

Gable and Dillon separated, filing for divorce in March 1929, while he began working on the play &quot;Hawk Island&quot; in New York which ran for 24 performances. In April 1930, Gable&#x27;s divorce became final, and a few days later he married Texas socialite Maria Franklin Prentiss Lucas Langham, nicknamed &quot;Ria&quot;. After moving to California, they were married again in 1931, possibly due to differences in state legal requirements.

===1930–1935: Early success===

In 1930, after his impressive appearance as the seething and desperate character Killer Mears in the Los Angeles stage production of &quot;The Last Mile&quot;, Gable was offered a contract with Pathé Pictures. His only film for them and first role in a sound picture was as the unshaven villain in their low-budget William Boyd Western, &quot;The Painted Desert&quot; (1931). The studio experienced financial problems after the film&#x27;s delayed release, so Gable left for work at Warner Bros.

The same year in &quot;Night Nurse&quot;, Gable played a villainous chauffeur who knocked Barbara Stanwyck&#x27;s character unconscious for trying to save two children whom he was methodically starving to death. The supporting role was originally slated for James Cagney until the release of &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; catapulted him to star status. &quot;His ears are too big and he looks like an ape&quot;, said Warner Bros. executive Darryl F. Zanuck about Gable, after testing him for the second male lead in the studio&#x27;s gangster drama &quot;Little Caesar&quot; (1931). After his failed screen test for Zanuck, Gable was signed in 1930 by MGM&#x27;s Irving Thalberg for $650 per week (equivalent to approximately $ in ). He hired the well-connected Minna Wallis, a sister of producer Hal Wallis, as his agent, whose clients included actresses Claudette Colbert, Myrna Loy and Norma Shearer.
Gable&#x27;s arrival in Hollywood occurred when MGM was looking to expand its stable of male stars, and he fit the bill. He made two pictures in 1931 with Wallace Beery. In the first, he had a seventh-billed support role in &quot;The Secret Six,&quot; although his role was much larger than the billing would indicate, then he achieved second billing in a part almost as large as the film&#x27;s star Beery in the naval aviation film &quot;Hell Divers.&quot; MGM&#x27;s publicity manager Howard Strickling started developing Gable&#x27;s studio image with &quot;Screenland&quot; magazine playing up his &quot;lumberjack-in-evening-clothes&quot; persona.

To increasing popularity, MGM frequently paired him with well-established female stars. Joan Crawford asked for him to appear with her in &quot;Dance, Fools, Dance&quot; (1931). The electricity of the pair was recognized by studio executive Louis B. Mayer, who would not only put them in seven more films but also began reshooting &quot;Complete Surrender&quot;, replacing John Mack Brown as Crawford&#x27;s leading man and retitling the film &quot;Laughing Sinners&quot; (1931). His fame and public visibility after &quot;A Free Soul&quot; (1931), in which he played a gangster who shoved the character played by Norma Shearer, ensured that Gable never played a supporting role again. He received extensive fan mail as a result of his performance; the studio took notice. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote &quot;A star in the making has been made, one that, to our reckoning, will outdraw every other star ... Never have we seen audiences work themselves into such enthusiasm as when Clark Gable walks on the screen.&quot;

Gable co-starred in &quot;Susan Lenox (Her Fall and Rise)&quot; (1931) with Greta Garbo, and in &quot;Possessed&quot; (1931), a film about an illicit romantic affair, with Joan Crawford (who was then married to Douglas Fairbanks Jr.). Adela Rogers St. Johns later dubbed Gable and Crawford&#x27;s real-life relationship as &quot;the affair that nearly burned Hollywood down&quot;. Louis B. Mayer threatened to terminate both their contracts, and for a while, they kept apart when Gable shifted his attentions to Marion Davies as he costarred with her in &quot;Polly of the Circus&quot; (1932). Gable was considered for the role of Tarzan in &quot;Tarzan the Ape Man&quot;, but lost out to Johnny Weissmuller&#x27;s more imposing physique and superior swimming prowess. Gable then starred as the romantic lead in &quot;Strange Interlude&quot; (1932), again teaming with Shearer, the second of three films they would make together for MGM.

Next, Gable starred with Jean Harlow in the romantic comedy-drama &quot;Red Dust&quot; (1932) set on a rubber plantation in Indochina. Gable portrayed a plantation manager involved with Harlow&#x27;s wisecracking prostitute; however, upon her arrival, Gable&#x27;s character started to pursue Mary Astor&#x27;s prim, classy newlywed.

While some critics thought Harlow stole the show, many agreed that Gable was a natural screen partner.

Gable&#x27;s &quot;unshaven love-making&quot; with braless Jean Harlow in &quot;Red Dust&quot; made him MGM&#x27;s most important romantic leading man. With Gable established as a star, MGM positioned him in the same manner as Harlow for Myrna Loy, a previously lesser billed actor in &quot;Night Flight&quot;, moving Loy to a costar role in &quot;Men in White&quot;, a movie filmed in 1933, though delayed in release due to pre-Code Legion of Decency cuts until 1934. The relationship of a doctor (Gable) and nurse (Elizabeth Allan) implied intimacy with a resulting complication of pregnancy, a sensitive issue and new image for Gable.

Gable and Harlow were then teamed in &quot;Hold Your Man&quot; (1933), &quot;China Seas&quot; (1935), in which the pair were billed above Wallace Beery, and &quot;Wife vs. Secretary&quot; (1936) with Myrna Loy costarring and supported by newcomer James Stewart. A popular combination on-screen and off, Gable and Harlow made six films together in five years. Their final film together was &quot;Saratoga&quot; (1937), a bigger hit than their previous collaborations. Harlow died during its production. The film was ninety percent completed, and the remaining scenes were filmed with long shots or the use of doubles like Mary Dees; Gable said he felt as if he were &quot;in the arms of a ghost&quot;.
When MGM head Louis B. Mayer decided that Gable was getting difficult and ungrateful, he loaned Gable out to the lower-rank Columbia studio, for one film &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, to teach Gable a lesson, but Columbia wanted him and had paid handsomely for it. The result was that Gable won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his 1934 performance in the film. &quot;Critics praised the fast-paced farce that would enter in a whole new romantic genre: the screwball comedy.&quot; Gable&#x27;s career was revitalized by his whimsical, good-natured performance and to the director Frank Capra, Gable&#x27;s character in the film closely resembled his real personality. Gable returned to MGM a bigger star than ever. From 1934 until 1942, when World War II interrupted his movie career, he was near the top of the box office money-makers lists.
Gable&#x27;s first movie role back at MGM was to portray reluctant leader of mutineers Fletcher Christian, an &quot;Englishman in knickers and a three-cornered hat&quot;, one he had to be talked into by friend and producer Irving Thalberg, and of which Gable said &quot;I stink in it&quot; after filming. &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1935) was a critical and commercial success, receiving eight Academy Award nominations. There were three Best Actor nominations for stars Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone, and the film won Best Picture, the second of three films in which Gable played a leading role to do so. The film cost $2 million and grossed $4.5 million, making it one of the top moneymakers that decade. It used life-size replicas of the &quot;Bounty&quot; and &quot;Pandora&quot;, and was partly filmed in Catalina and French Polynesia.

=== 1936–1939: Tracy collaborations and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; ===

Gable made three pictures with Spencer Tracy, which boosted Tracy&#x27;s career and permanently cemented them in the public mind as a team. &quot;San Francisco&quot; (1936), with Jeanette MacDonald, featured Tracy for only 17 minutes in an Oscar-nominated portrayal of a Catholic priest who knocks Gable down in a boxing ring. The film was a box office hit and remains the third-highest-grossing film of Gable&#x27;s career. Their next film together was the Academy Award–nominated box office success &quot;Test Pilot&quot; (1938), with Myrna Loy, who made seven pictures with Gable. He plays Jim Lane, the test pilot of the title; Tracy is his sidekick mechanic, Gunner Morse.

For their final film, 1940&#x27;s &quot;Boom Town&quot;, Tracy would play a larger role, with billing directly under Gable and above Claudette Colbert and Hedy Lamarr. The picture, a lavish epic about two oil wildcatters who become partners then rivals, was a box office success, earning $5 million. Gable and Tracy were off-screen friends; Tracy was one of the few Hollywood industry luminaries who attended Lombard&#x27;s private funeral. After &quot;Boom Town&quot; no more Gable-Tracy partnerships were possible; Tracy&#x27;s success led to a new contract and both stars had conflicting stipulations requiring top billing in MGM movie credits and on promotional posters.
Despite his reluctance to play the role, Gable is best known for his Oscar-nominated performance in the Academy Award-winning best picture &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939). Carole Lombard may have been the first to suggest that he play Rhett Butler (and she play Scarlett) when she bought him a copy of the best-seller, which he refused to read. His total salary was $117,917 for the film ($ in ).

Butler&#x27;s last line in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, &quot;Frankly, my dear, I don&#x27;t give a damn&quot;, is one of the most famous lines in movie history. Gable was an almost immediate favorite for the role of Rhett with both the public and producer David O. Selznick. Since Selznick had no male stars under long-term contract, he needed to negotiate with another studio to borrow an actor. Gary Cooper was Selznick&#x27;s first choice. When Cooper turned down the role of Butler, he was quoted as saying, &quot;&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is going to be the biggest flop in Hollywood history. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;ll be Clark Gable who&#x27;s falling flat on his nose, not me.&quot; By then, Selznick had become determined to hire Gable, and set about finding a way to borrow him from MGM. Gable was wary of potentially disappointing an audience that had decided that no one else could play the part. He later conceded, &quot;I think I know now how a fly must react after being caught in a spider&#x27;s web.&quot;

According to Lennie Bluett, an extra in the film, Gable almost walked off the set when he discovered the studio facilities were segregated and signage posted &quot;White&quot; and &quot;Colored&quot;. Gable phoned the film&#x27;s director Victor Fleming and told him, &quot;If you don&#x27;t get those signs down, you won&#x27;t get your Rhett Butler.&quot; The signs were then taken down. Gable tried to boycott the &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; premiere in segregated Atlanta, because African American actors Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen were not permitted to attend. He reportedly only went after McDaniel pleaded with him to go. They appeared in several more films, remaining life-long friends and he always attended her Hollywood parties.

Gable did not want to shed tears for the scene after Rhett inadvertently causes Scarlett to miscarry their second child. Olivia de Havilland made him cry, later commenting, &quot;Oh, he would not do it. He would not! Victor (Fleming) tried everything with him. He tried to attack him on a professional level. We had done it without him weeping several times and then we had one last try. I said, &#x27;You can do it, I know you can do it, and you will be wonderful...&#x27; Well, by heaven, just before the cameras rolled, you could see the tears come up at his eyes and he played the scene unforgettably well. He put his whole heart into it.&quot; The role was one of Gable&#x27;s most layered performances and partially based on the personality of director and friend Fleming.

Years later, Gable said that whenever his career would start to fade, a re-release of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; would soon revive his popularity, and he continued as a top leading actor for the rest of his life. One reissue publicized &quot;Clark Gable never tires of holding Vivien Leigh&quot;.

=== 1939–1942: Established star ===
Between his marriage to Lombard and her death, Gable again costarred with Norma Shearer in the World War II romantic intrigue film, &quot;Idiot&#x27;s Delight&quot; (1939). He plays a nightclub singer that doesn&#x27;t recognize former love (Shearer) while Nazis are closing in on guests at a hotel on the brink of war. The film is memorable for Gable&#x27;s song and dance routine, &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Ritz&quot; and an alternative ending.

Gable also starred in &quot;Strange Cargo&quot; (1940), a romantic drama with Joan Crawford, costarring Peter Lorre and Ian Hunter. The film&#x27;s focus is on Gable and French Devil&#x27;s Islands convicts in an escape from the penal colony, who on the way pick up a local entertainer (Crawford) whom Gable had met earlier in the movie. In their eighth and last film together, Gable and Crawford &quot;again demonstrated their on-screen magic&quot; and the film was among the top ten grossing films for the year.

Gable then made his first film with 20-year old Lana Turner, a newcomer whom MGM saw as a successor for both Crawford and the now-deceased Jean Harlow. &quot;Honky Tonk&quot; (1941) is a western where Gable&#x27;s con-man/gambler character romances Turner, a prim, young judge&#x27;s daughter.
, Gable had been reluctant to act opposite the younger Turner in the required romantic scenes. But their chemistry served them well in this and three later films, with &quot;Honky Tonk&quot; finishing third at the box office that year.

Since the couple had been popular with the public, Gable and Turner were quickly paired again in &quot;Somewhere I&#x27;ll Find You&quot; (1941) as war correspondents who travel to the Pacific theatre and get caught up in a Japanese attack.
 The movie was another hit finishing No. 8 at the box office for 1942. Film historian David Thomson wrote the quality of his movies after &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; &quot;hardly befitted a national idol&quot; and began a career decline for Gable.

=== 1942–1944: World War II ===

On August 12, 1942, following Lombard&#x27;s death and his completion of the film &quot;Somewhere I&#x27;ll Find You&quot;, Gable joined the United States Army, under the Army Air Forces. Lombard had suggested that Gable enlist as part of the war effort, but MGM was reluctant to let him go. Commanding General of the U.S. Army Air Forces Henry H. &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold offered Gable a &quot;special assignment&quot; with the First Motion Picture Unit following basic training. &quot;The Washington Star&quot; reported that Gable took a physical examination at Bolling Field on June 19, preliminary to joining the service.

&quot;Mr. Gable, it was learned from a source outside the war department, conferred with Lieutenant General H. H. Arnold, head of the air forces yesterday.&quot; &quot;The Star&quot; continued, &quot;It was understood that Mr. Gable, if he is commissioned, will make movies for the air forces. Lieutenant Jimmy Stewart, another actor in uniform, has been doing this.&quot;

Gable had expressed an earlier interest in officer candidate school, with the intention of becoming an aerial gunner upon enlisting in bomber training school. MGM arranged for his studio friend, the cinematographer Andrew McIntyre, to enlist with him and accompany him through training.

On August 17, 1942, shortly after his enlistment, he and McIntyre were sent to Miami Beach, Florida, where they entered USAAF OCS Class 42-E. Both completed training on October 28, 1942, and were commissioned as second lieutenants. His class of about 2,600 students (of which he ranked about 700th) selected Gable as its graduation speaker. General Arnold presented the cadets with their commissions. Arnold then informed Gable of his special assignment: to make a recruiting film in combat with the Eighth Air Force to recruit aerial gunners. Gable and McIntyre were immediately sent to Flexible Gunnery School at Tyndall Field, Florida, followed by a photography course at Fort George Wright, Washington State and promoted to first lieutenants upon its completion.

On January 27, 1943, Gable reported to Biggs Army Airfield, Texas to train with and accompany the 351st Bomb Group to England as head of a six-man motion picture unit. In addition to McIntyre, he recruited the screenwriter John Lee Mahin, camera operators Sgts. Mario Toti and Robert Boles, and the sound man Lt. Howard Voss, to complete his crew. Gable was promoted to captain while he was with the 351st Bomb Group at Pueblo Army Air Base, Colorado, a rank commensurate with his position as a unit commander. (Prior to this, he and McIntyre were both first lieutenants.)

Gable spent most of 1943 in England at RAF Polebrook with the 351st Bomb Group. Gable flew five combat missions, including one to Germany, as an observer-gunner in B-17 Flying Fortresses between May 4 and September 23, 1943, earning the Air Medal and the Distinguished Flying Cross for his efforts. During one of the missions, Gable&#x27;s aircraft was damaged by flak and attacked by fighters, which knocked out one of the engines and shot up the stabilizer. In the raid on Germany, one crewman was killed and two others were wounded, and flak went through Gable&#x27;s boot and narrowly missed his head. When word of this reached MGM, studio executives began to badger the Army Air Forces to reassign its most valuable screen actor to noncombat duty. Many of the men he served with, such as former Tech. Sgt. Ralph Cowley, said Gable actually unofficially joined other missions and the above five were only a fraction of the total. Adolf Hitler favored Gable above all other actors. During World War II, Hitler offered a sizable reward to anyone who could capture and bring Gable to him unscathed.

In November 1943, Gable returned to the United States to edit his film, on an old Warner&#x27;s lot donated to the war effort, assigned to the 18th AAF Base Unit (Motion Picture Unit) at Culver City, California, where other stars contributed with any film equipment they had as well. In June 1944, Gable was promoted to major. While he hoped for another combat assignment, he had been placed on inactive duty and on June 12, 1944, his discharge papers were signed by Captain (later U.S. president) Ronald Reagan. Gable completed editing of the film &quot;Combat America&quot; in September 1944, giving the narration himself and making use of numerous interviews with enlisted gunners as focus of the film.

Because his motion picture production schedule made it impossible for him to fulfill reserve officer duties, he resigned his commission on September 26, 1947, a week after the Air Force became an independent service branch. Gable was awarded military honors for service: the Distinguished Flying Cross, Air Medal, American Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, and World War II Victory Medal. He was a qualified aerial gunner having received his wings upon completion of flexible gunnery school at Tyndall field.

=== 1945–1953: After World War II ===
Immediately after his discharge from the service, Gable returned to his ranch and rested. Personally, he resumed a pre-war relationship with Virginia Grey, a co-star from &quot;Test Pilot&quot; and &quot;Idiot&#x27;s Delight&quot;, that newspapers reported might be the next Mrs. Gable. Professionally, Gable&#x27;s first movie after World War II was &quot;Adventure&quot; (1946), with Greer Garson, by then the leading female star at MGM. Given the famous teaser tagline &quot;Gable&#x27;s back, and Garson&#x27;s got him&quot;, the film was a commercial hit, earning over $6 million, but a critical failure.
Gable was acclaimed for his performance in &quot;The Hucksters&quot; (1947), a satire of post-war Madison Avenue corruption and immorality, which co-starred Deborah Kerr and Ava Gardner. The film was popular with audiences, placing 11th at the box office, but both &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed it as a sanitized version of the novel with script issues, that was heavy on Gable screentime, who struggled in the role. Gable followed this up with &quot;Homecoming&quot; (1948), where he played a married doctor enlisting in World War II and meeting Lana Turner&#x27;s army surgical nurse character with a romance unfolding in flashbacks. After that he made the war film &quot;Command Decision&quot; (1948), a psychological drama with Walter Pidgeon, Van Johnson, Brian Donlevy, and John Hodiak. It was a hit with audiences, but it lost MGM money due to the high cost of the all-star cast. &quot;Variety&quot; said, &quot;[Gable&#x27;s] is a believable delivery, interpreting the brigadier-general who must send his men out to almost certain death with an understanding that bespeaks his sympathy with the soldier... &quot;.

A very public and brief romance with Paulette Goddard occurred after that. In 1949, Gable married Sylvia Ashley, a British model and actress previously married to Douglas Fairbanks Sr. The relationship was profoundly unsuccessful; they divorced in 1952. Gable did a series of films with female co-stars: &quot;Any Number Can Play&quot; (1950) with Alexis Smith, &quot;Key to the City&quot; (1950) with Loretta Young, and &quot;To Please a Lady&quot; (1950) with Barbara Stanwyck. They were reasonably popular, but he had more success with two Westerns: &quot;Across the Wide Missouri&quot; (1951), and &quot;Lone Star&quot; (1952). He then made &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; (1953) opposite Gene Tierney. Tierney was a favorite of Gable&#x27;s, and he was very disappointed when her mental health problems caused her to be replaced in &quot;Mogambo&quot; by Grace Kelly.
&quot;Mogambo&quot; (1953), directed by John Ford, was a somewhat sanitized and more action-oriented remake of Gable&#x27;s hit pre-Code film &quot;Red Dust&quot;, with Jean Harlow and Mary Astor. Ava Gardner, in her third and final pairing with Gable, was well received in Harlow&#x27;s leading lady role, as was Kelly in Astor&#x27;s role, with both receiving Academy Award nominations, Gardner for Lead Actress and Kelly for Supporting Actress. While on location in Africa, reports of an affair between Gable and Kelly began to surface (the result of private dinners the stars were having), but their relationship was an intense friendship according to costar Gardner, with Kelly herself later commenting on the lack of any sexual aspect, &quot;maybe because of the age difference&quot;. The publicity only helped ticket sales as the film finished No. 7 at the box office, grossing 8.2 million for the year, easily his most popular hit since he returned to MGM after the war.

===1954–1957: Leaving MGM===

Despite the positive critical and public response to &quot;Mogambo&quot;, Gable became increasingly unhappy with what he considered mediocre roles offered by MGM, while the studio regarded his salary as excessive. Studio head Louis B. Mayer was fired in 1951, amid slumping revenue and increased Hollywood production costs, due in large part to the rising popularity of television. The new studio head, former production chief Dore Schary, struggled to maintain profits for the studio. Many long-time MGM stars were fired, or their contracts were not renewed, including Greer Garson and Judy Garland. Gable refused to renew his contract. His last film at MGM was &quot;Betrayed&quot; (1954), an espionage wartime drama with Turner and Victor Mature. Critic Paul Mavis wrote, &quot;Gable and Turner just don&#x27;t click the way they should here...poor plots and lines never stopped these two pros from turning in good performances in other films.&quot; In March 1954, Gable left MGM.

His next two films were made for 20th Century Fox: &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;, an adventure story in Hong Kong with Susan Hayward, and &quot;The Tall Men&quot; (1955), a Western with Jane Russell and Robert Ryan. Both were profitable, although only modest successes, earning Gable his first profit sharing royalties. In 1955, Gable would be 10th at the box office – the last time he was in the top ten. That same year, Gable married fifth wife Kay Spreckels (née Kathleen Williams). A former fashion model and actress, she had previously been married three times: first to Charles Capps (1937–39), then to Argentinian cattle tycoon Martín de Alzaga (1942–43), and to sugar-refining heir Adolph B. Spreckels Jr. (1945–52). Gable became stepfather to her son Bunker Spreckels, who went on to live a notorious celebrity lifestyle in the late 1960s and early 1970s surfing scene, ultimately leading to his early death in 1977.
Gable also formed Russ-Field-Gabco in 1955, a production company with Jane Russell and her husband Bob Waterfield, and they produced &quot;The King and Four Queens&quot; (1956), a film Gable thought would also star Russell to capitalize on &quot;The Tall Men&quot;&#x27;s moderate success. That role instead went to Jo Van Fleet. It was Gable&#x27;s only time as producer. He found producing and acting to be too much work and this Raoul Walsh western was the only film made. After turning down the lead role in Universal-International&#x27;s &quot;Away All Boats&quot;, his next project was the Warner Bros. production &quot;Band of Angels&quot; (1957), co-starring Yvonne De Carlo and featuring relative newcomer Sidney Poitier; it was not well received, despite Gable&#x27;s role&#x27;s similarities to Rhett Butler. &quot;Newsweek&quot; said, &quot;Here is a movie so bad that it must be seen to be disbelieved.&quot;

=== 1958–1961: Paramount and &quot;The Misfits&quot; ===
Next, he paired with Doris Day in &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot; (1958), shot in black and white at Paramount. He did &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot; (also 1958), with co-star and producer Burt Lancaster, which featured his first on-screen death since 1937, and which garnered good reviews. Gable started to receive television offers, but rejected them outright. At 57, Gable finally acknowledged, &quot;Now it&#x27;s time I acted my age&quot;. His contracts began including a clause that his filming and work days ended at 5 p.m.

His next two films were light comedies for Paramount: &quot;But Not for Me&quot; (1959) with Carroll Baker, and &quot;It Started in Naples&quot; (1960) with Sophia Loren. &quot;Naples&quot; was written and directed by Melville Shavelson and it mainly showed the beauty of Loren and the Italian island Capri. It was a box-office success and was nominated for an Academy Award for art direction and two Golden Globes, one for picture and Loren for actress in a leading role. Filmed mostly on location in Italy, it was Gable&#x27;s last film released in color. While there Gable&#x27;s weight had increased to , something he credited to pasta, and he started on a crash diet to achieve a goal weight of 195, along with briefly quitting drinking and smoking, to pass a required physical for his next movie.

On February 8, 1960, Gable received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in motion pictures, located at 1608 Vine Street.
Gable&#x27;s last film was &quot;The Misfits&quot; (1961), with a script by Arthur Miller and directed by John Huston. Co-starring with Gable were Marilyn Monroe (in her last completed film), Montgomery Clift, Eli Wallach and Thelma Ritter. Many critics regard Gable&#x27;s performance to be his finest, and Gable, after seeing the rough cuts, agreed, although the film did not receive any Oscar nominations. Miller wrote the screenplay for his wife Monroe; it was about two aging cowboys and a pilot that go mustanging in Reno, Nevada, who all fall for a blonde. In 1961, it was a somewhat disconnected film with its antihero western themes, but it has since become a classic.

Portraitist Al Hirschfeld created a drawing, and then a lithograph, portraying the film&#x27;s stars Clift, Monroe, and Gable with screenwriter Miller, in what is suggested as a typical &quot;on-the-set&quot; scene during the troubled production. In a 2002 documentary Eli Wallach recalled the mustang wrangling scenes Gable insisted on performing himself, &quot;You have to pass a physical to film that&quot; and &quot;He was a professional going home at 5 p.m. to a pregnant wife&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; found &quot;Mr. Gable&#x27;s performance as a leathery old cowboy with a realistic slant on most plain things&quot; ironically vital, with his death before the film&#x27;s release.

== Filmography ==

Gable is known to have appeared as an &quot;extra&quot; in 13 films between 1924 and 1930. He then appeared in a total of 67 theatrically released motion pictures, as himself in 17 &quot;short subject&quot; films, and he narrated and appeared in a 1945 World War II propaganda film entitled &quot;Combat America&quot;, produced by the United States Army Air Forces.

Gable was one of the most consistent box-office performers in the history of Hollywood, appearing on Quigley Publishing&#x27;s annual Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll sixteen times. He appeared opposite many of the most popular actresses of their time. Joan Crawford was a favorite actress of his to work with, and he partnered with her in eight films. Myrna Loy worked with him seven times, and he was paired with Jean Harlow in six productions. He also starred with Lana Turner in four features, and in three each with Norma Shearer and Ava Gardner. Gable died of a heart attack at the age of 59; his final on-screen appearance was as an aging cowboy in &quot;The Misfits&quot;, released posthumously in 1961.

==Personal life==
=== Marriages and children ===

Gable married five times and was linked romantically to many other women. His first engagement was to actress Franz Dorfler when he was about 21. Dorfler introduced Gable to Josephine Dillon, who would become his acting coach, manager, and then his wife. When Gable and Dillon married on December 13, 1924, in California, Gable was 23 and Dillon was 40; the couple divorced in 1930. His second wife was Texas socialite Maria Franklin Prentiss Lucas Langham Gable (nicknamed &quot;Ria&quot;). The couple married on June 19, 1931, in California and divorced on March 7, 1939. Thirteen days after his divorce from Maria, Gable married actress Carole Lombard during a production break on &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

 Carole Lombard 

Gable&#x27;s relationship with and marriage in 1939 to his third wife, actress Carole Lombard (1908–1942), was one of the happiest periods of his personal life. They met while filming 1932&#x27;s &quot;No Man of Her Own&quot;, when Lombard was still married to actor William Powell. A Gable and Lombard romance did not take off until 1936, after becoming reacquainted at a party. They were soon inseparable, with fan magazines and tabloids citing them as an official couple.

Gable thrived being around Lombard&#x27;s youthful, charming, and frank personality, once stating: 
Gable was still legally married, having prolonged an expensive divorce from his second wife, Ria Langham, until his salary from &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; enabled him to reach a divorce settlement with her on March 7, 1939. On March 29, during a production break on &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, Gable and Lombard were married in Kingman, Arizona, and honeymooned in room 1201 of the Arizona Biltmore Hotel. They purchased a ranch previously owned by director Raoul Walsh in Encino, California, for $50,000 making it their home. The couple, who lovingly referred to each other as &quot;Ma and Pa&quot;, owned a menagerie of animals and raised chickens and horses there.

With the bombing of Pearl Harbor many Hollywood stars joined the war effort, some such as James Stewart signing up for active duty. Carole Lombard sent a telegram to President Roosevelt on behalf of Gable expressing his interest in doing so, but F.D.R. thought the 41-year-old actor could best serve by increased patriotic roles in movies and bond drives, which Lombard tirelessly began.

On January 16, 1942, Lombard was a passenger on Transcontinental and Western Air Flight 3 with her mother and press agent Otto Winkler. She had just finished her 57th movie, &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot;, and was on her way home from a successful war bond selling tour when the flight&#x27;s Douglas DC-3 airliner crashed into Potosi Mountain near Las Vegas, Nevada, killing all 22 passengers aboard, including 15 servicemen en route to training in California. Gable flew to the crash site to claim the bodies of his wife, mother-in-law, and Winkler, who had been the best man at Gable and Lombard&#x27;s wedding. Lombard was declared to be the first war-related American female casualty of World War II, and Gable received a personal note of condolence from President Roosevelt. The Civil Aeronautics Board investigation into the crash concluded that pilot error was its cause.

Gable returned to their Encino ranch and carried out her funeral wishes as she had requested in her will. A month later, he returned to the studio to work with Lana Turner in their second movie together, &quot;Somewhere I&#x27;ll Find You&quot;. Having lost since the tragedy, Gable evidently was emotionally and physically devastated, but Turner stated that Gable remained a &quot;consummate professional&quot; for the duration of filming. He acted in 27 more films, and remarried twice more. &quot;But he was never the same&quot;, according to Esther Williams. &quot;He had been devastated by Carole&#x27;s death.&quot;

 Sylvia Ashley 

In 1949, Gable married Sylvia Ashley, an English model and actress who was the widow of Douglas Fairbanks; the couple divorced in 1952.

 Kay Spreckels 

In 1955, Gable married Kay Spreckels (née Kathleen Williams), a thrice-married former fashion model and actress who had previously been married to sugar-refining heir Adolph B. Spreckels Jr.

Four months after his 1960 death, Kay Gable gave birth to his only biological son, John Clark Gable. John Clark raced cars and trucks most notably in the Baja 500 and 1000, turning down Hollywood offers to act until &quot;Bad Jim&quot; (1990)&quot;,&quot; a straight-to-video film&quot;.&quot; By 1999, his work with the Clark Gable Foundation helped restore the house in which his father was born in Cadiz, Ohio, and open it as a museum. John Clark had two children: Kayley Gable (born 1986) and Clark James Gable (1988–2019). Kayley is an actress, while Clark James was the host of two seasons of the nationally syndicated reality show &quot;Cheaters&quot;. Clark James died of a drug overdose at age 30 on February 22, 2019.

 Relationship with Loretta Young 

During the filming of &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; in early 1935, the film&#x27;s lead actress, Loretta Young, became pregnant with Gable&#x27;s child. Clark Gable had allegedly slept with Young while on an overnight train from a studio location to Hollywood. Their daughter, Judy Lewis, was born on November 6, 1935, in Venice, California. Young hid her pregnancy in an elaborate scheme. Nineteen months after the birth, she claimed to have adopted the baby. Most in Hollywood (and some in the general public) believed Gable was Lewis&#x27; father because of their strong resemblance and the timing of her birth. In 1950, Gable came to her mother&#x27;s house to visit her briefly. Gable asked Lewis about her life and then, upon leaving, kissed her on her forehead. It was the only time that Lewis ever spoke to Gable and, at the time, she had no idea that he was her father.

As an adult, Lewis spoke of the confusion, isolation and alienation she felt within her own family while growing up. Five years after Gable&#x27;s death, when confronted by Judy Lewis, Loretta Young said that she was Lewis&#x27; biological mother and that Gable was her father by an affair. Young died on August 12, 2000; her autobiography, published posthumously, confirmed that Gable was indeed Lewis&#x27; father. Judy Lewis died of cancer at age 76 on November 25, 2011. In 2015, Young&#x27;s daughter-in-law alleged that Young had said in 1998 that Judy Lewis was conceived by date rape. Young had previously admitted to an affair with Gable, which was a known secret in Hollywood at the time. Young&#x27;s family had chosen to remain silent about the information until both Young and Lewis were deceased; they went public with the information four years after Lewis&#x27; death.

=== Politics ===
Gable was a conservative Republican. In 1944, Gable became an early member of the conservative Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a group explicitly created to help root out Communists from the film industry. In addition to Gable, its members included such industry heavyweights as Walt Disney, Ayn Rand, Ronald Reagan, and John Wayne; they helped create and enforce the Hollywood blacklist, often by testifying under oath before the House Un-American Activities Committee.

In 1933, Gable was initiated into Freemasonry at the Beverly Hills Lodge No. 528 California.

=== Illness and death ===
On November 6, 1960, Gable was sent to Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles, where doctors found that he had suffered a heart attack. Newspaper reports the following day listed his condition as satisfactory. By the morning of November 16, he seemed to be improving, but he died that evening at the age of 59 from a second heart attack caused by an infection. Medical staff did not perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation for fear that the procedure would rupture Gable&#x27;s heart, and a defibrillator was not available.

Gable is interred in the Great Mausoleum, Memorial Terrace, at Glendale&#x27;s Forest Lawn Memorial Park next to Carole Lombard and her mother. An honor guard and pallbearers Spencer Tracy and James Stewart were in attendance. Twenty-two years later Kay Gable died and was interred there as well.

== Style and reception ==
In a photo essay of Hollywood film stars, &quot;Life&quot; magazine called Gable, &quot;All man ... and then some.&quot;

Doris Day summed up Gable&#x27;s unique personality: &quot;He was as masculine as any man I&#x27;ve ever known, and as much a little boy as a grown man could be —it was this combination that had such a devastating effect on women.&quot;

Joan Crawford--Gable&#x27;s eight-time co-star, longtime friend, and on-again, off-again girlfriend--stated on David Frost&#x27;s TV show in January 1970 that Gable &quot;was a king wherever he went. He earned the title. He walked like one, he behaved like one, and he was the most masculine man that I have ever met in my life. Gable had balls&quot;.

Robert Taylor said Gable &quot;was a great, great guy, and certainly one of the great stars of all times, if not the greatest. I think that I sincerely doubt that there will ever be another like Clark Gable; he was one of a kind.&quot;

In his memoir &quot;Bring on the Empty Horses&quot;, David Niven states that Gable, a close friend, was extremely supportive after the sudden, accidental death of Niven&#x27;s first wife, Primula (Primmie), in 1946. Primmie had supported Gable emotionally after Carole Lombard&#x27;s death four years earlier: Niven recounts Gable kneeling at Primmie&#x27;s feet and sobbing while she held and consoled him. Niven also states that Arthur Miller, the author of &quot;The Misfits&quot;, had described Gable as &quot;the man who did not know how to hate.&quot;

Gable has been criticized for altering aspects of a script he felt were in conflict with his image. Screenwriter Larry Gelbart, as quoted in James Garner&#x27;s biography stated that Gable, &quot;... refused to go down with the submarine, because Gable doesn&#x27;t sink.&quot; (In reference to Gable&#x27;s film &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot;). The novel&#x27;s author, Capt. Beach, noted changes should be made among the crew to get a Hollywood audience and where a subsequent battle sequence was altered when he should have had script approval, feeling his book was bought by United Artists for its title.

Eli Wallach recalls in his 2006 autobiography &quot;The Good, The Bad and Me&quot;, that what he felt was one of his best dramatic scenes in &quot;The Misfits&quot; was cut from the script. Wallach&#x27;s character is emotionally crushed when he visits Roslyn (Marilyn Monroe), and instead runs into Gable&#x27;s character and realizes any hope with Roslyn is dashed. Gable asked (within his contractual rights) that the scene be removed, and when Wallach spoke to him, Gable explained he felt that &quot;his character would never steal a woman from a friend.&quot;

== In popular culture ==

Warner Bros. cartoons sometimes caricatured Gable. Examples include: &quot;Have You Got Any Castles?&quot; (in which his face appears seven times inside the novel &quot;The House of the Seven Gables&quot;), &quot;The Coo-Coo Nut Grove&quot; (in which his ears flap on their own), &quot;Hollywood Steps Out&quot; (in which he follows an enigmatic woman), &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; (in which he appears on a billboard promotion for &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and on the backlot of MGM&quot;)&quot;, and &quot;Jungle Jitters&quot; (where the queen of a village imagines a traveling salesman as Gable).

He also appears in Disney cartoons like &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Polo Team&quot;, where he is flirting with Clarabelle Cow, and &quot;The Autograph Hound&quot;.

Bugs Bunny&#x27;s nonchalant carrot-chewing standing position, as explained by Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, and Bob Clampett, originated in a scene in the film &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934), in which Clark Gable&#x27;s character leans against a fence, eating carrots rapidly and talking with his mouth full to Claudette Colbert&#x27;s character. This scene was well known while the film was popular, and viewers at the time likely recognized Bugs Bunny&#x27;s behavior as parody.
In January 1937, Gable was honored with a block in the forecourt of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre.

Along with actor Kent Taylor, Clark Gable served as the inspiration behind the name of Superman&#x27;s alter-ego Clark Kent.

In the 1937 film &quot;Broadway Melody of 1938&quot;, Judy Garland (aged 15) sings &quot;You Made Me Love You&quot; while looking at a composite picture of Gable. The opening lines are: &quot;Dear Mr Gable, I am writing this to you, and I hope that you will read it so you&#x27;ll know, my heart beats like a hammer, and I stutter and I stammer, every time I see you at the picture show, I guess I&#x27;m just another fan of yours, and I thought I&#x27;d write and tell you so. You made me love you, I didn&#x27;t want to do it, I didn&#x27;t want to do it...&quot;

The 1948 Cole Porter tune &quot;Always True to You in My Fashion&quot; contains the lyrics &quot;Mister Gable, I mean Clark / Wants me on his boat to park&quot;.

The 1975 film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; contained a reference to impersonating Gable in the song performed by the Knights of the Round Table.

The 2003 music album &quot;Give Up&quot; by The Postal Service has a song titled &quot;Clark Gable&quot;. The singer wants to &quot;find a love that looks and sounds like a movie&quot;, and includes the lyric, &quot;I kissed you in a style Clark Gable would have admired, I thought it classic&quot;.

Gable has been portrayed in a number of films. Actors who have played the role include: Phillip Waldron in &quot;It Happened in Hollywood&quot; (1937), James Brolin in &quot;Gable and Lombard&quot; (1976), Larry Pennell in &quot;&quot; (1980), Edward Winter in &quot;&quot; (1980), Boyd Holister in &quot;Grace Kelly&quot; (1983), Gary Wayne in &quot;Malice in Wonderland&quot; (1985), Gene Daily in &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; (1991), Bobby Valentino in &quot;RKO 281&quot; (1999), Bruce Hughes and Shayne Greenman in &quot;Blonde&quot; (2001), and Charles Unwin in &quot;Lucy&quot; (2003).

In &quot;Drunk History&quot; Season 3 2015 Miami episode 2, Josh Hartnett portrays Gable. The focus is on Gable&#x27;s military service and his training in Miami.

<text>Flash Gordon is the protagonist of a space adventure comic strip created and originally drawn by Alex Raymond. First published January 7, 1934, the strip was inspired by, and created to compete with, the already established &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; adventure strip.

==Creation==
The &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; comic strip had been commercially very successful, spawning novelizations and children&#x27;s toys, and King Features Syndicate decided to create its own science fiction comic strip to compete with it. At first, King Features tried to purchase the rights to the &quot;John Carter of Mars&quot; stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs. However, the syndicate was unable to reach an agreement with Burroughs. King Features then turned to Alex Raymond, one of their staff artists, to create the story.

One source for Flash Gordon was the Philip Wylie novel &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; (1933). The book&#x27;s themes of an approaching planet threatening the Earth, and an athletic hero, his girlfriend, and a scientist traveling to the new planet by rocket, were adapted by Raymond for the comic strip&#x27;s initial storyline. Raymond&#x27;s first samples were dismissed for not containing enough action sequences. Raymond reworked the story and sent it back to the syndicate, which accepted it. Raymond was partnered with ghostwriter Don Moore, an experienced editor and writer. Raymond&#x27;s first &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; story appeared in January 1934, alongside &quot;Jungle Jim&quot;. The &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; strip was well received by newspaper readers, becoming one of the most popular American comic strips of the 1930s.

As with &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;, the success of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; resulted in numerous licensed products being sold, including pop-up books, coloring books, and toy spaceships and rayguns.

==Comic strip characters and story==

The &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comic strip ran as a Sunday strip from 1934 until 2003, and daily strip from 1940 to 1944 and 1951 to 1992. Reprints of the Sunday strip were syndicated by King Features Syndicate from 2003 until 2023, when Flash Gordon was relaunched with a new daily and Sunday strip.

The comic strip follows the adventures of Flash Gordon, a handsome polo player and Yale University graduate, and his companions Dale Arden and Dr. Hans Zarkov. The story begins with Earth threatened by a collision with the planet Mongo. Dr. Zarkov invents a rocket ship to fly into space in an attempt to stop the disaster. Half mad, he kidnaps Flash and Dale. Landing on the planet, and halting the collision, they come into conflict with Ming the Merciless, Mongo&#x27;s evil ruler.

For many years, the three companions have adventures on Mongo, traveling to the forest kingdom of Arboria, ruled by Prince Barin; the ice kingdom of Frigia, ruled by Queen Fria; the jungle kingdom of Tropica, ruled by Queen Desira; the undersea kingdom of the Shark Men, ruled by King Kala; and the flying city of the Hawkmen, ruled by Prince Vultan. They are joined in several early adventures by Prince Thun of the Lion Men. Eventually, Ming is overthrown, and Mongo is ruled by a council of leaders led by Barin.

Flash and friends visit Earth for a series of adventures before returning to Mongo and crashing in the kingdom of Tropica, later reuniting with Barin and others. Flash and his friends then travel to other worlds before returning once again to Mongo, where Barin, now married to Ming&#x27;s daughter Princess Aura, has established a peaceful rule (except for frequent revolts led by Ming or by one of his many descendants).

In the 1950s, Flash became an astronaut who travelled to other planets besides Mongo. The long story of the Skorpi War takes Flash to other star systems, using starships that are faster than light.

In addition to Ming and his allies, Flash and his friends also fought several other villains, including Azura, the Witch Queen; Brukka, chieftain of the giants of Frigia; the fascistic Red Sword organisation on Earth; and Brazor, the tyrannical usurper of Tropica. After Raymond&#x27;s tenure, later writers created new enemies for Flash to combat. Austin Briggs created Kang the Cruel, Ming&#x27;s callous son. Prince Polon, who had the power to shrink or enlarge living creatures, the unscrupulous Queen Rubia, and Pyron the Comet Master were among the antagonists introduced during Mac Raboy&#x27;s run. The Skorpi, a race of alien shape shifters who desired to conquer the galaxy, were recurring villains in both the Mac Raboy and Dan Barry stories. The Skorpi space-fighter ace Baron Dak-Tula became a periodic nemesis of Flash in the late 1970s stories.

==International versions of the comic strip==

King Features sold the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; strip to newspapers across the world, and by the late 1930s, the strip was published in 130 newspapers, translated into eight foreign languages, and was read by 50 million people. In the 1930s and 1940s, several newspapers in Britain carried &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, including the Scottish &quot;Sunday Mail&quot;. In France, his adventures were published in the magazine &quot;Robinson&quot;, under the name &quot;Guy l&#x27;Éclair&quot;. Dale Arden was named Camille in the French translation. In Australia, the character and strip were retitled &quot;Speed Gordon&quot; to avoid a negative connotation of the word &quot;Flash&quot;. (At the time, the predominant meaning of &quot;flashy&quot; was &quot;showy&quot;, connoting dishonesty.)

However, events in the 1930s affected the strip&#x27;s distribution. Newspapers in Nazi Germany were forbidden to carry the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; strip, while in Fascist Italy it was restricted to two newspapers. In 1938, the Spanish magazine &quot;Aventurero&quot;, the only publication in the country to carry &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, ceased publication because of the Spanish Civil War. The outbreak of World War II resulted in &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; being discontinued in many countries. In Belgium, artist Edgar Pierre Jacobs was therefore asked to bring the current &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; story to a satisfactory conclusion, which he did.

After the war&#x27;s end, the strip enjoyed a resurgence in international popularity. &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; reappeared in Italy, Spain and West Germany, and it was also syndicated to new markets like Portugal and the Irish Republic. From the 1950s onward, countries like Spain, Italy and Denmark also reprinted &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; newspaper strips in comic book or paperback novel form. In India, &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comics were published by Indrajal Comics.

==Later years==
The popularity of Raymond&#x27;s &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; Sunday strip meant a daily strip was also introduced. This strip was drawn by Austin Briggs and ran from 1941 to 1944. After Raymond left &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; in 1944 to join the US Marines, the daily strip was cancelled and Briggs took over the Sunday strip. Although Raymond wanted to return to drawing &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; after the war&#x27;s end, King Features did not want to remove Briggs from his position. To conciliate Raymond, King Features allowed him to create a new strip, &quot;Rip Kirby&quot;. After Briggs left the Sunday strip in 1948, he was succeeded by former comic book artist Mac Raboy, who drew the strip until his death in 1967. In 1951, King Features created a new daily &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; strip. This strip was drawn by Dan Barry. Barry was assisted during his tenure by Harvey Kurtzman and Harry Harrison, who both wrote scripts for the strip. Barry also had several artists who aided him with &quot;Flash Gordon&#x27;s&quot; illustrations, including Frank Frazetta, Al Williamson, Bob Fujitani, Jack Davis, Sy Barry, Fred Kida and Emil Gershwin. When Barry left the strip in 1990, various artists and writers worked on &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;. The daily strip was ended in 1993. The final artist to work on the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; Sunday strip was Jim Keefe. Keefe was occasionally assisted on the strip by other artists, including Williamson, John Romita Sr. and Joe Kubert. King Features ended the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; newspaper strip in 2003, although re-runs of Keefe&#x27;s strip still appear in a few US newspapers.

On October 20, 2023, it was announced that King Features Syndicate would relaunch &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; on October 22 under cartoonist Dan Schkade and would be released daily, the Sunday strip being an overview of the week&#x27;s strips.

==Critical reception and influence==
&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; is regarded as one of the best illustrated and most influential of American adventure comic strips. Historian of science fiction art Jane Frank asserted that because of his work on &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, &quot;Raymond is one of the most famous science fiction artists of all time, although he never contributed an illustration to any science fiction magazine or book&quot;. Comic book artist Jerry Robinson has said &quot;What made &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; a classic strip was Raymond&#x27;s artistry and the rich imagination he brought to his conceptions of the future&quot; and described the final years of Raymond&#x27;s tenure on the strip as being characterized by &quot;sleek, brilliantly polished brush work.&quot; The science fiction historian John Clute has stated that &quot;The comics version of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; was graceful, imaginative and soaring&quot; and included it on a list of the most important American science fiction comics. In an article about Raymond for &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, R.C. Harvey declared that Raymond&#x27;s &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; displayed &quot;a technical virtuosity matched on the comics pages only by Harold Foster in &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;&quot;. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; stated that &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;″s &quot;elaborately shaded style and exotic storyline&quot; made it one of the most influential comics, and that its art emphasized a &quot;romantic baroque&quot;.

&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (along with &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;) was a big influence on later science fiction comic strips, such as the American &quot;Don Dixon and the Hidden Empire&quot; (1935 to 1941) by Carl Pfeufer and Bob Moore. In Italy, Guido Fantoni drew Flash Gordon in 1938, after the prohibition by the fascist regime. In Belgium, Edgar P. Jacobs was commissioned to produce a science fiction comic strip in the style of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;. Jacobs&#x27; new strip, &quot;Le Rayon U&quot; (&quot;The U-Ray&quot;) began serial publication in &quot;Bravo&quot; in 1943. This version had text boxes which described the action and the dialogue, in the style of many Belgian comics of the time, similar to Hal Foster&#x27;s version of &quot;Tarzan&quot; and &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;. In 1974, Jacobs reformatted &quot;Le Rayon U&quot; in order to include speech bubbles. This version was published in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine and in book form by Dargaud-Le Lombard. The British comic &quot;The Trigan Empire&quot;, by Mike Butterworth and Don Lawrence, also drew on &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; for its artistic style. In Thailand Flash Gordon was a big influence for classic thai comics character Chaochaiphomthong (เจ้าชายผมทอง) (meaning &quot;prince golden hair&quot;) a sword and magic hero created by Jullasak Amornvej in 1958.

&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; was also an influence on early superhero comics characters. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster based Superman&#x27;s uniform of tights and a cape on costumes worn by Flash Gordon. Bob Kane&#x27;s drawing of Batman on the cover of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; No. 27 (the first appearance of the character) was based on a 1937 Alex Raymond drawing of Flash Gordon. Dennis Neville modeled the comics hero Hawkman&#x27;s costume on the &quot;Hawkmen&quot; characters in Raymond&#x27;s &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comic strip. In &quot;&quot;, Iron Man mockingly refers to Star-Lord as Flash Gordon due to their similar appearance and both being space heroes.

Scientist and track-and-field olympian Meredith C. Gourdine&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Flash&quot; Gourdine, was based on Flash Gordon.

==Films==
Most of the Flash Gordon film and television adaptations retell the early adventures on the planet Mongo.

===Film serials===

Flash Gordon was featured in three serial films starring Buster Crabbe: &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1936), &quot;Flash Gordon&#x27;s Trip to Mars&quot; (1938), and &quot;Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe&quot; (1940). The 1936 &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; serial was condensed into a feature-length film titled &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; or &quot;Rocket Ship&quot; or &quot;Space Soldiers&quot; or &quot;Flash Gordon: Spaceship to the Unknown&quot;; the 1938 serial into a feature-length film entitled &quot;Flash Gordon: The Deadly Ray from Mars;&quot; and the 1940 serial into a feature-length film entitled &quot;The Purple Death from Outer Space&quot;.

The first Flash Gordon serial remains copyrighted, but the compilation made of the second serial, and the third serial itself are in the public domain.

===&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; 1980 film===

In the 1970s, several noted directors attempted to make a film of the story. Federico Fellini optioned the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; rights from Dino De Laurentiis, but never made the film. George Lucas also attempted to make a &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; film in the 1970s, but was unable to acquire the rights from De Laurentiis, so he decided to create &quot;Star Wars&quot; instead. De Laurentiis then hired Nicolas Roeg to make a &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; film, but was unhappy with Roeg&#x27;s ideas, and Roeg left the project. De Laurentiis also discussed hiring Sergio Leone to helm the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; film; Leone declined because he believed the script was not faithful to the original Raymond comic strips. Finally, De Laurentiis hired Mike Hodges to direct the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; film.

Hodges&#x27; 1980 &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; film stars former &quot;Playgirl&quot;-centerfold Sam J. Jones in the title role. Its plot is based loosely on the first few years of the comic strip, revising Flash&#x27;s backstory by making him the quarterback of the New York Jets instead of a polo player. Raymond&#x27;s drawings feature heavily in the opening credits, as does the signature theme-song &quot;Flash&quot; by rock band Queen, who composed and performed the entire musical score.

Riding the coat-tails of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; was not a critical success on release. Melody Anderson co-starred with Jones as Dale Arden, alongside Chaim Topol as Dr. Hans Zarkov, Max von Sydow as Ming, Timothy Dalton as Prince Barin, Brian Blessed as Prince Vultan, Peter Wyngarde as Klytus and Ornella Muti as Princess Aura. Produced by Dino De Laurentiis, with ornate production designs and costumes by Danilo Donati, the bright colors and retro effects were inspired directly by the comic strip and 1930s serials.

Brian Blessed&#x27;s performance as the Hawkman leader Prince Vultan lodged the veteran stage and screen actor into the collective consciousness for the utterance of a single line – &quot;GORDON&#x27;S ALIVE?!&quot; – which, more than 30 years later, remained the most repeated, reused, and recycled quotation from both the film and Blessed&#x27;s career.

The film&#x27;s cult status led it to feature heavily in the comedy films &quot;Ted&quot; (2012) and &quot;Ted 2&quot; (2015) causing a resurgence in interest in the film.

===Unofficial films===
In 1967, a low-budget Turkish adaptation of the comic was made, called &quot;Flash Gordon&#x27;s Battle in Space&quot; (&quot;Baytekin – Fezada Çarpisanlar&quot; in Turkish). Hasan Demirtag played Flash Gordan.

Robb Pratt, director of the popular fan film &quot;Superman Classic&quot;, made &quot;Flash Gordon Classic&quot;, released in May 2015. The traditionally animated short features the characters Flash Gordon, girlfriend Dale Arden, sidekick Dr. Hans Zarkov, antagonist Ming the Merciless, and Princess Aura.

===Possible future films===
In 2010, Breck Eisner expressed interest to direct a 3D film version of Flash Gordon. Since April 2014, 20th Century Fox was developing the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; reboot with J. D. Payne and Patrick McKay writing the film&#x27;s script. Matthew Vaughn was in talks to direct the film. Mark Protosevich was hired to rewrite the film&#x27;s script. Julius Avery was later signed to write and direct film, with Vaughn as producer alongside John Davis. An animated film was under development at Disney/Fox with Taika Waititi writing and directing. In August 2019, the animated film was believed to be cancelled, but in July 2021, producers John Davis and John Fox revealed that Waititi was still working on the film, albeit it would now be live action instead of animation.

==Television==

===&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1954–55 live-action)===

Steve Holland starred in a 1954–55 live-action television series which ran for 39 episodes. The first 26 episodes had the distinction of being filmed in West Berlin, Germany, less than a decade after the end of World War II. This is notable, given that some episodes show the real-life destruction still evident in Germany several years after the war. The final 13 episodes were filmed in Marseille, France.

In this series, Flash, Dale (Irene Champlin) and Dr. Zarkov (Joseph Nash) worked for the Galactic Bureau of Investigation in the year 3203. The actual timeline was established in one episode, &quot;Deadline at Noon&quot;, in which Flash, Dale and Dr. Zarkov went back in time to Berlin in the year 1953. The GBI agents traveled in the Skyflash and Skyflash II spaceships.

The series was syndicated, appearing on stations affiliated with the long-defunct DuMont Network, and many other independent stations in the United States. It was recut into a movie in 1957.

===&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; animated (1979–82)===

In 1979, Filmation produced an animated series, often referred to as &quot;The New Adventures of Flash Gordon&quot;, though it is actually titled &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;. The expanded title was used to distinguish it from previous versions. The project was originally designed as a television film but NBC decided to change it into an animated series.

===&quot;Flash Gordon: The Greatest Adventure of All&quot; (1981)===

Filmation produced this successful animated television movie, written by &quot;Star Trek&quot; writer Samuel A. Peeples, before they began their Saturday morning series, but the television movie did not actually air until the early 1980s (December 1981 in the UK, and August 1982 in the US). 

This movie has yet to be commercially released in the United States, although some sources indicate that off-air bootlegs are prevalent. The only known commercial releases were by VAP Video in Japan (catalog #67019-128), in 1983, in both laserdisc and NTSC VHS videotape formats; and in Bulgaria, where it was released on VHS &quot;Van Chris&quot; and &quot;Drakar&quot;. The movie also aired numerous times on &quot;Diema&quot; Channel in the late 1990s. In the Japanese release, it is presented uncut with the original English voice track, with Japanese subtitles added for its intended audience. At the movie&#x27;s ending is a trailer for the De Laurentiis live-action movie, as well as trailers for other titles from the VAP Video library at the time. The covers for both versions feature comic-strip panels, using stills taken from the movie. 

The movie was also released theatrically in some European Countries, as evidenced by this portuguese lobby card.

===&quot;Defenders of the Earth&quot; (1986)===

In the 1986 cartoon &quot;Defenders of the Earth&quot;, Flash teamed up with fellow King Features heroes The Phantom and Mandrake the Magician in 65 episodes. This series took extreme liberties with all the characters, revealing that Flash and Dale Arden had conceived a son, Rick Gordon, who is in his mid-teens when the series begins. Dale has her mind torn from her body by Ming in the first episode and is preserved in a crystal, which Rick is able to recover and give to his father. Dale is reborn on Earth as Dynak-X, the strategic super-computer based in the Defenders&#x27; Headquarters.

===&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1996)===

In 1996, Hearst Entertainment premiered an animated &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; television series. In this version, Alex &quot;Flash&quot; Gordon and Dale Arden are hoverboarding teenagers, who become trapped on Mongo after stopping Ming&#x27;s attempt to invade Earth.

===&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (2007–08 live-action)===
A live-action series, comprising 22 one-hour episodes, was produced in Canada in early 2007. Under an agreement with King Features Syndicate, the series was produced by Reunion Pictures of Vancouver with Robert Halmi Sr. and Robert Halmi Jr. of RHI Entertainment serving as Executive Producers.

Sci-Fi Channel premiered its new &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; series in the United States on August 10, 2007.

The traditional primary supporting characters of Ming, Dale Arden, and Dr. Hans Zarkov were drastically altered. Eric Johnson, best known for his earlier work on the WB&#x27;s &quot;Smallville&quot;, played the title character of Steven &quot;Flash&quot; Gordon. Gina Holden played Dale Arden, Jody Racicot played Dr. Hans Zarkov, and John Ralston portrayed the arch-villain, Ming.

==Radio serials and audio-dramas==
Starting April 22, 1935, the strip was adapted into &quot;The Amazing Interplanetary Adventures of Flash Gordon&quot;, a 26-episode weekly radio serial. The series followed the strip very closely, amounting to a week-by-week adaptation of the Sunday strip for most of its run.

Flash Gordon was played by Gale Gordon, later famous for his television roles in &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot;, &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; and &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; (the latter two with Lucille Ball). The cast also included Maurice Franklin as Dr. Zarkov and Bruno Wick as Ming the Merciless.

The radio series broke with the strip continuity in the last two episodes, when Flash, Dale and Zarkov returned to Earth. They make a crash landing in Malaysia, where they meet Jungle Jim, the star of another of Alex Raymond&#x27;s comic strips.

The series ended on October 26, 1935, with Flash and Dale&#x27;s marriage. The next week, &quot;The Adventures of Jungle Jim&quot; picked up in that Saturday timeslot.

Two days later, on October 28, &quot;The Further Interplanetary Adventures of Flash Gordon&quot; debuted as a daily show, running four days a week. This series strayed further from Raymond&#x27;s strip, involving Flash, Dale and Zarkov in an adventure in Atlantis. The series aired 60 episodes, ending on February 6, 1936.

Twenty-six years after he had played Flash Gordon in the last of the three Universal film serials (1940), Buster Crabbe again played Flash for two newly recorded audio-dramas released as the 1966 LP, &quot;The Official Adventures Of Flash Gordon&quot; (MGM/Leo The Lion Records CH-1028).

==Stage==
In 1989, Lee Ahlin and Gary Gordon wrote a musical for children, &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, based on the comic. The musical premiered in 1989 in Oak Hall Performing Arts Theater in Gainesville, Florida. &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; starred Brian LeDuc as Flash, Kim Ehrich as Dale Arden, John Pelkey as Ming, and Julie Hamric as Princess Aura.

==Comic books==
Over the years, several publishers have produced &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comics, either reprints or original stories:
* David McKay Publications &quot;King Comics&quot; #1–155 (1936–1949) [strip reprints]
* Dell Comics &quot;Four Color Comics&quot; #10, 84, 173, 190, 204, 247, 424, 512; &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; #2 (1945–1953) [first 2 strip reprints]
* Harvey Comics #1–5 (1950) [strip reprints]
* Gold Key Comics #1 (1965) [reprints FC #173]
* King Comics #1–11 (1966–1967) (also in &quot;Phantom&quot; #18–20)
* Charlton Comics #12–18 (1969–1970)
* Gold Key Comics #19–27 (1978–1979); under their &quot;Whitman Comics&quot; #28–37 (1980–1982)
Several issues of the King Comics series were drawn by Al Williamson, who won the 1966 National Cartoonists Society Award for Best Comic Book for his work on the series. Williamson later said: &quot;I was paying homage to Alex [Raymond], you know. I tried to treat his creation with respect and dignity and tried to do it to the best of my ability. I find that other artists who have done Flash Gordon just don&#x27;t seem to get the feeling of the strip, you know. Flash is a noble guy and it&#x27;s kind of nice to have that kind of a hero&quot;. King also released a comic version as a part of their Comics Reading Library in the 1970s.

Williamson provided artwork for a Western Publishing adaptation of Dino De Laurentiis&#x27; &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; film, written by Bruce Jones. It was released by Western Publishing in both hardcover and softcover formats to coincide with the film&#x27;s release, and was also serialized in three issues of Whitman&#x27;s Flash Gordon comic book, #31-33, March–May 1981.

In 1988, Dan Jurgens wrote a modernized version of the comic strip as a nine-issue DC Comics miniseries. It features Flash as a washed up basketball player who finds new purpose in life on Mongo, Dale as an adventurous reporter who is just as capable as Flash, and a gray-skinned Ming who is less of an Asian stereotype. The series ran for the planned nine issues and was left with an open-ended conclusion. Though Mongo is not a threat to Earth in this series, Ming had every intention of conquering Earth once he coerced Dr. Zarkov into designing the needed ships.

In 1995, Marvel Comics published a new two-issue series, written by Mark Schultz with art by Al Williamson, in the style of the &quot;Flash&quot; comics Williamson had produced for King and others.

A new comic book series was released by Ardden Entertainment in August 2008, though with inconsistent release dates for subsequent issues. The series was written by Brendan Deneen and Paul Green and debuted in 2008, with the first arc entitled &quot;The Mercy Wars&quot;. The initial story arc concluded in mid-2009. These were followed by further storylines. Ardden also published a Flash Gordon anthology entitled &quot;The Secret History of Mongo&quot;. Ardden&#x27;s second Flash Gordon arc is titled &quot;Invasion of the Red Sword&quot; (2010). Two other arcs were completed.

A reprint of all of Al Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comic books in black and white was printed by Flesk in 2009.

In 2010, Dark Horse Comics began an archive reprint series in hardback, starting with the original comics published by Dell. The second volume covers the comics published by King Comics, the third covers the comics published by Charlton Comics, the fourth covers the comics published by Gold Key, and the fifth covers the comics published by Whitman.

In 2011, Dynamite Entertainment began a new series called &quot;Flash Gordon: Zeitgeist&quot;. The series is written by Eric Trautmann (&quot;Vampirella&quot;, &quot;Red Sonja&quot;), from a story and designs by Alex Ross (&quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, &quot;Marvels&quot;, &quot;Project: Superpowers&quot;) and illustrated by Daniel Lindro. The company also produced a spin-off miniseries, &quot;Merciless: The Rise of Ming&quot;, in 2012, with story and art by Scott Beatty and Ron Adrian. Following a crossover miniseries called &quot;King&#x27;s Watch&quot; (where, much like &quot;Defenders of the Earth&quot;, Flash Gordon teamed up with Mandrake and the Phantom; albeit, set in the 21st century), Dynamite launched a new Flash Gordon ongoing series in 2014, with story and art by Jeff Parker and Evan &quot;Doc&quot; Shaner. In 2015, Dynamite followed this run with another &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; miniseries as part of their &quot;King: Dynamite&quot; series. This series was written by Ben Acker and Ben Blacker and illustrated by Lee Ferguson.

In July 2023, Mad Cave Studios announced that it had obtained the license to publish new stories, graphic novels and reprints. In 2024, Mad Cave Studios published a new Flash Gordon comic book, a trade paperback of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Defenders of the Earth&quot; series and launched a new series of the team.

==&quot;Flash Gordon Strange Adventure Magazine&quot;==

In 1936, one issue of &quot;Flash Gordon Strange Adventure Magazine&quot; was published by Harold Hersey, featuring a novel about Flash Gordon, entitled &quot;The Master of Mars&quot;. It was written by little-known author James Edison Northford. The saddle-stitched novel was based (more or less) on the comic strip story lines, and included color illustrations reminiscent of Alex Raymond&#x27;s artwork. On the back pages a second installment, &quot;The Sun Men of Saturn&quot;, was promised, but it never saw print. Even though the series did not gain in popularity, the lone issue of &quot;Flash Gordon Strange Adventure Magazine&quot; has become a much sought-after item for pulp magazine collectors.

==Novels==
===&quot;Big Little Books&quot;===
The &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; strip was adapted for the &quot;Big Little Books&quot; series by the Whitman Publishing Company in 1934; the books follow the strip stories very closely and were designed with a captioned illustration opposite each page of text. The series ran for 14 installments from 1934 until 1948. The books were:
*&quot;Flash Gordon on the Planet Mongo&quot; (1934) 
*&quot;Flash Gordon and the Monsters of Mongo&quot; (1935) 
*&quot;Flash Gordon and the Tournaments of Mongo&quot; (1935)
*&quot;Flash Gordon and the Witch Queen of Mongo&quot; (1936)
*&quot;Flash Gordon vs. the Emperor of Mongo&quot; (1936)

*&quot;Flash Gordon and the Perils of Mongo&quot; (1940) 
*&quot;Flash Gordon and the Tyrant of Mongo&quot; (1941)
*&quot;Flash Gordon and the Ice World of Mongo&quot; (1942)

*&quot;Flash Gordon and the Fiery Desert of Mongo&quot; (1948)

===&quot;Flash Gordon in the Caverns of Mongo&quot; (1936)===
The first novel based on the strip, &quot;Flash Gordon in the Caverns of Mongo&quot;, was published in 1936 by Grosset &amp; Dunlap. The credited author was Alex Raymond, but Doug Murray claims the novel &quot;was almost certainly ghost-written&quot;. Like the pulp magazine of the same year, it failed to launch a series.

===Avon Books===
In 1973, Avon Books launched a six-book series of adult-oriented Flash Gordon novels: &quot;The Lion Men of Mongo&quot;, &quot;The Plague of Sound&quot;, &quot;The Space Circus&quot;, &quot;The Time Trap of Ming XIII&quot;, &quot;The Witch Queen of Mongo&quot; and &quot;The War of the Cybernauts&quot;. Although the books were credited to Alex Raymond, the first three were written by SF writer Ron Goulart (under the house name &quot;Con Steffanson&quot;) and the other three novels were by Bruce Cassiday (the first under the &quot;Steffanson&quot; name, and the latter two under the pseudonym &quot;Carson Bingham&quot;).

===1980 film novelization===
A novelization of the 1980 film was written by Arthur Byron Cover, and published in the United States by Jove Publications and in the United Kingdom by New English Library.

===Tempo Books===
In 1980, Tempo Books released a series by David Hagberg: &quot;Massacre in the 22nd Century&quot;, &quot;War of the Citadels&quot;, &quot;Crisis on Citadel II&quot;, &quot;Forces from the Federation&quot;, &quot;Citadels under Attack&quot; and &quot;Citadels on Earth&quot;. Except for the names of the hero and his co-stars of Dale Arden and Dr. Hans Zarkov, this series had little to do with any other version of Flash Gordon.

==1939 World&#x27;s Fair==
The name &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; was emblazoned on the proscenium of a ride at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. An article in &quot;Popular Science&quot; (March 1939) described how 150 people could enter a ride designed to resemble a rocket ship with a motion picture screen and vibrating seats for a simulated trip to another planet. The ride was located &quot;at the opposite end of the amusement zone from the parachute tower&quot;. Fairgoers walked around a simulation of Venus as a jungle planet, inhabited by mechanical dinosaurs to enter a &quot;Martian Headquarters&quot;, where &quot;weirdly costumed Martians and mechanically animated models of giant beasts enact[ed] episodes from the adventures of Flash Gordon&quot;. The ride&#x27;s Martians did not look like those in the 1938 serial, nor did the rocket ship.

==Reprints==

Raymond&#x27;s work, particularly his Sunday strips, has been reprinted many times over the years by many different publishers.

Some of the Austin Briggs dailies were reprinted by Kitchen Sink Press. The King Comics run of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; reprinted one Alex Raymond story and two Mac Raboy ones in 1967. The Mac Raboy Sundays have been reprinted by Dark Horse Comics in black and white, while Kitchen Sink began to collect both the Dan Barry and Austin Briggs daily strips. The Dan Barry dailies have never been entirely reprinted, but the Barry stories written by noted author Harry Harrison were reprinted in &quot;Comics Revue&quot; magazine, published by Manuscript Press. Tempo Books published six mass-market paperbacks reprinting Dan Barry strips from the 1970s in the 1980s. Two stories from the Dan Barry dailies, D2-133 &quot;Baldur Battles Skorpi&quot; (February 24 to May 10, 1986) and D2-134 &quot;The Bear&quot; (May 12 to August 21, 1986), were reprinted in an oblong format, 6.5 by 10.5 paperback edition with two strips per page by Budget Books PTY of Melbourne, Australia in 1987 under the title &quot;The New Adventures of Flash Gordon&quot;, . A reprint of all of Al Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comic strip and comic book work was released in 2009.

==Parodies==
&quot;Flesh Gordon&quot; (1974) is an American erotic science fiction adventure comedy film. It is an erotic spoof of the Universal Pictures &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; serials from the 1930s. The screenplay was written by Michael Benveniste, who also co-directed the film with Howard Ziehm. The cast includes Jason Williams, Suzanne Fields, and William Dennis Hunt. The film had an MPAA rating of X, but was also re-edited for a reduced rating of R. It has an original runtime of 78 minutes, and the unrated &quot;collector&#x27;s edition&quot; release runs 90 minutes.

Several episodes of the spin-off series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; featured a holodeck program called &quot;The Adventures of Captain Proton&quot;, which features many elements lifted straight from the Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s.

The comedy film &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; (1983) featured a deleted scene with Ralphie and his Red Ryder BB gun saving Flash (played by Paul Hubbard) from Ming (played by Colin Fox). None of the footage from the scene survived.

In the comedy film &quot;Ted&quot; (2012), Sam Jones appears in character both as himself and as Flash Gordon. Jones reprised his role for the sequel &quot;Ted 2&quot; (2015).

<text>The Aon Center (200 East Randolph Street, formerly Amoco Building) is a modern supertall skyscraper located in the Northeast corner of the Chicago Loop, Chicago, Illinois, United States, designed by architect firms Edward Durell Stone and The Perkins and Will partnership, and completed in 1973 as the Standard Oil Building (nicknamed &quot;Big Stan&quot;). With 83 floors and a height of 1,136 feet (346 m), it is the fourth-tallest building in Chicago, surpassed in height by the Willis Tower, Trump International Hotel and Tower, and St.Regis Chicago.

The building is managed by Jones Lang LaSalle, which is also headquartered in the building. Aon Center houses the headquarters of Aon, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, and Kraft Heinz (BCBS and Kraft Heinz each have a second headquarters, located in Washington D.C. and Pittsburgh respectively); the building formerly served as the world headquarters of Amoco prior to its merger into BP.

The building was briefly the tallest in Chicago, but was soon surpassed by the Sears Tower. It was the fourth-tallest building in the world at the time of its completion.

==History==

===Construction===
The Standard Oil Building was constructed as the headquarters of the Standard Oil Company of Indiana. Standard&#x27;s previous home had been 910 S. Michigan Avenue. This building was constructed in 1911 by the Karpen Brothers Furniture Company and was purchased by Standard in 1927. When the new Standard Oil Building was completed in 1973, it was the tallest completed building in Chicago and the fourth-tallest in the world, earning it the nickname &quot;Big Stan&quot;. In 1974, the taller Sears Tower (now Willis Tower) in Chicago surpassed it as the tallest completed building in Chicago (the Sears Tower was also the tallest in the world). However, the Sears Tower had already been topped out in May 1973. When the Aon Center opened as the fourth-tallest completed building in the world, it was only exceeded in height by the twin towers of the original World Trade Center and the Empire State Building in New York City. Originally clad in marble, the Aon Center was also the tallest marble-clad building in the world.

The building employs a tubular steel-framed structural system with V-shaped perimeter columns to resist earthquakes, reduce sway, minimize column bending, and maximize column-free space. This construction method was also used for the original World Trade Center twin towers in New York City.

===Refacing===
When completed, it was the world&#x27;s tallest marble-clad building, sheathed entirely with 43,000 slabs of Italian Carrara marble. The marble used was thinner than previously attempted in cladding a building, which soon proved to be a mistake. On December 25, 1973, during construction a 350-pound marble slab detached from the façade and penetrated the roof of the nearby Prudential Center. In 1985, inspection found numerous cracks and bowing in the marble cladding of the building. To alleviate the problem, stainless steel straps were added to hold the marble in place. Later, from 1990 to 1992, the entire building was refaced with Mount Airy white granite at an estimated cost of over $80 million. Amoco was reluctant to divulge the actual amount, but it was well over half the original price of the building, without adjustment for inflation. Two-thirds of the discarded marble was crushed and used as landscaping decoration at Amoco&#x27;s refinery in Whiting, Indiana, one-sixth was donated to Governors State University, in University Park, and one-sixth donated to Regalo, a division of Lashcon Inc. Under a grant from the Illinois Department of Rehabilitative Services, Regalo&#x27;s 25 handicapped workers carved the discarded marble into a variety of specialty items such as corporate gifts and mementos including desk clocks and pen holders. The building&#x27;s facade somewhat resembles that of the North and South tower of the former World Trade Center Complex due to the upward flow of the columns.

===Designation===
The Standard Oil Building was renamed the Amoco Building when the company changed names in 1985. In 1998, Amoco sold the building to The Blackstone Group for an undisclosed amount, estimated to be between $430 and $440 million. It was renamed as the Aon Center on December 30, 1999, although the Aon Corporation would not become the building&#x27;s primary tenant until September 2001. In May 2003, Wells Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. acquired the building for between $465 and $475 million. On August 10, 2007, Wells Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. changed its name to Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc.)

Real estate investors Mark Karasick and Victor Gerstein acquired the building from Piedmont in 2015 for $713 million.

===Planned observation deck===

On May 14, 2018, the building&#x27;s owners unveiled a $185 million proposal for an observatory featuring a thrill ride on the roof called the Sky Summit, the world&#x27;s tallest exterior elevator, and new entrance pavilion. The observatory was supposed to be completed in 2022, but the COVID-19 pandemic had been announced to have delayed construction plans by about a year.

<doc id="42090" wikidata="Q186492" url="?curid=42090" title="George S. Patton">
<text>George Smith Patton Jr. (11 November 1885 – 21 December 1945) was a general in the United States Army who commanded the Seventh Army in the Mediterranean Theater of World War II, then the Third Army in France and Germany after the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944.

Born in 1885, Patton attended the Virginia Military Institute and the United States Military Academy at West Point. He studied fencing and designed the M1913 Cavalry Saber, more commonly known as the &quot;Patton Saber.&quot; He competed in the modern pentathlon in the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden finishing in fifth place. Patton entered combat during the Pancho Villa Expedition of 1916, the United States&#x27; first military action using motor vehicles. He fought in World War I as part of the new United States Tank Corps of the American Expeditionary Forces: he commanded the U.S. tank school in France, then led tanks into combat and was wounded near the end of the war. In the interwar period, Patton became a central figure in the development of the army&#x27;s armored warfare doctrine, serving in numerous staff positions throughout the country. At the United States&#x27; entry into World War II, he commanded the 2nd Armored Division.

Patton led U.S. troops into the Mediterranean theater with an invasion of Casablanca during Operation Torch in 1942, and soon established himself as an effective commander by rapidly rehabilitating the demoralized II Corps. He commanded the U.S. Seventh Army during the Allied invasion of Sicily, where he was the first Allied commander to reach Messina. There he was embroiled in controversy after he slapped two shell-shocked soldiers, and was temporarily removed from battlefield command. He was assigned a key role in Operation Fortitude, the Allies&#x27; military deception campaign for Operation Overlord. At the start of the Western Allied invasion of France, Patton was given command of the Third Army, which conducted a highly successful rapid armored drive across France. Under his decisive leadership, the Third Army took the lead in relieving beleaguered American troops at Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge, after which his forces drove deep into Nazi Germany by the end of the war.

During the Allied occupation of Germany, Patton was named military governor of Bavaria, but was relieved for making aggressive statements towards the Soviet Union and questioning denazification. He commanded the United States Fifteenth Army for slightly more than two months. Severely injured in an auto accident, he died in Germany twelve days later, on 21 December 1945.

Patton&#x27;s colorful image, hard-driving personality, and success as a commander were at times overshadowed by his controversial public statements. His philosophy of leading from the front, and his ability to inspire troops with attention-getting, vulgarity-laden speeches, such as his famous address to the Third Army, was received favorably by his troops, but much less so by a sharply divided Allied high command. His sending the doomed Task Force Baum to liberate his son-in-law, Lieutenant Colonel John K. Waters, from a prisoner-of-war camp further damaged his standing with his superiors. His emphasis on rapid and aggressive offensive action proved effective, and he was regarded highly by his opponents in the German High Command. An award-winning biographical film released in 1970, &quot;Patton&quot;, helped popularize his image.

== Early life ==
George Smith Patton Jr. was born on 11 November 1885, in the Los Angeles suburb of San Gabriel, California, to George S. Patton and his wife, Ruth Wilson, the daughter of Benjamin Davis Wilson, the second mayor of Los Angeles, and Margaret Hereford, a widow from Virginia. The wealthy Patton family resided at Lake Vineyard, built by Benjamin Wilson, on in present-day San Marino, California. Patton had a younger sister, Anne, nicknamed &quot;Nita&quot;. Nita became engaged to John J. Pershing, Patton&#x27;s mentor, in 1917, but the engagement ended because of their separation during Pershing&#x27;s time in France during World War I.

As a child, Patton had difficulty learning to read and write, but eventually overcame this and was known in his adult life to be an avid reader. He was tutored from home until the age of eleven, when he was enrolled in Stephen Cutter Clark″s Classical School for Boys, a private school in Pasadena, for six years. Patton was described as an intelligent boy and was widely read in classical military history, particularly the exploits of Hannibal, Scipio Africanus, Julius Caesar, Joan of Arc, and Napoleon Bonaparte, as well as those of family friend John Singleton Mosby, who frequently stopped by the Patton family home when George was a child. He was also a devoted horseback rider.

Patton never seriously considered a career other than the military. At the age of seventeen he sought an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He also applied to several universities with military corps of cadet programs, and was accepted to Princeton, but eventually decided on Virginia Military Institute (VMI), which his father and grandfather had attended.&lt;ref name=&quot;vmi.edu/patton-family&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the school from 1903 to 1904, and though he struggled with reading and writing, performed exceptionally in uniform and appearance inspection, as well as military drill.

While he was at VMI, Senator Thomas R. Bard nominated him for West Point. He was an initiate of the Beta Commission of Kappa Alpha Order.

In his plebe (first) year at West Point, Patton adjusted easily to the routine. However, his academic performance was so poor that he was forced to repeat his first year after failing mathematics. He excelled at military drills, though his academic performance remained average. He was cadet sergeant major during his junior year, and the cadet adjutant his senior year. He also joined the football team, but he injured his arm and stopped playing on several occasions. Instead he tried out for the sword team and track and field and specialized in the modern pentathlon. He competed in this sport in the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, and he finished in fifth place—right behind four Swedes.

Patton graduated number 46 out of 103 cadets at West Point on 11 June 1909, and received a commission as a second lieutenant in the Cavalry branch of the United States Army.

At age 24, Patton married Beatrice Banning Ayer, the daughter of Boston industrialist Frederick Ayer, on 26 May 1910, in Beverly Farms, Massachusetts. They had three children, Beatrice Smith (born March 1911), Ruth Ellen (born February 1915), and George Patton IV (born December 1923). Patton&#x27;s wife Beatrice died on 30 September 1953, from a ruptured aneurysm after falling while riding her horse in a hunt with her brother and others at the Myopia Hunt Club in South Hamilton, Massachusetts.

Patton was an Episcopalian.

=== Ancestry ===
The Patton family was of Scottish, Irish, Scots-Irish,French, English and Welsh ancestry. Patton&#x27;s great, great grandfather, Robert Patton, of Ayrshire, Scotland, emigrated from Scotland to America. His great-grandmother came from an aristocratic Welsh family, descended from many Welsh lords of Glamorgan, which had an extensive military background. Patton believed he had formerly lived as a soldier and took pride in mystical ties with his ancestors. Though not directly descended from George Washington, Patton traced some of his English colonial roots to George Washington&#x27;s great-grandfather. He is a 1st cousin six times removed of George Washington. 

He was also descended from England&#x27;s King Edward I through Edward&#x27;s son Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent. Family belief held the Pattons were descended from sixteen barons who had signed Magna Carta. Patton believed in reincarnation, stating that he had fought in previous battles and wars before his time, additionally, his ancestry was very important to him, forming a central part of his personal identity. The first Patton in North America was Robert Patton, born in Ayr, Scotland. He emigrated to Culpeper, Virginia, from Glasgow, in either 1769 or 1770. 

George Patton, Jr.&#x27;s paternal grandfather was George Smith Patton, who commanded the 22nd Virginia Infantry under Jubal Early in the Civil War and was killed in the Third Battle of Winchester, while his great-uncle Waller T. Patton was killed in Pickett&#x27;s Charge leading the 7th Virginia Infantry regiment during the Battle of Gettysburg. Patton also descended from Hugh Mercer, who had been killed in the Battle of Princeton during the American Revolutionary War. Patton&#x27;s father, who graduated from the Virginia Military Institute (VMI), became a lawyer and later the district attorney of Los Angeles County. Patton&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Benjamin Davis Wilson, a merchant who had been the second Mayor of Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;snac/99166/w6nm5g3z&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

His father was a wealthy rancher and lawyer who owned a ranch near Pasadena, California. Wilson had married into one of the original Southern California settler families by marrying Ramona Yorba, who was the daughter of prominent Californio (Spanish and Mexican settlers in California) Bernardo Yorba, after whom the city of Yorba Linda is named. Patton is also a descendant of French Huguenot Louis DuBois.

==== Personality ====
George S. Patton is believed to have had narcissistic personality disorder by many modern psychologists and historians.

== Early military career ==
Patton&#x27;s first posting was with the 15th Cavalry at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, where he established himself as a diligent leader who impressed superiors with his dedication. In late 1911, Patton was transferred to Fort Myer, Virginia, where many of the Army&#x27;s senior leaders were stationed. Befriending Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, Patton served as his aide at social functions on top of his regular duties as quartermaster for his troop. Patton had a high-pitched voice and worried that this would make it impossible for him to inspire his troops.

=== 1912 Olympics ===

For his skill in running and fencing, Patton was selected as the Army&#x27;s entry for the first modern pentathlon at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden. Patton was the only American among the 42 pentathletes, who were all officers. Patton placed twenty-first on the pistol range, seventh in swimming, fourth in fencing, sixth in the equestrian competition, and third in the footrace, finishing fifth overall and first among the non-Swedish competitors.

There was some controversy concerning his performance in the pistol shooting competition, in which he used a .38 caliber U.S. Army-issue pistol while most of the other competitors chose .22 caliber firearms. He claimed that the holes in the paper from his early shots were so large that a later bullet passed through them, but the judges decided that one of his bullets missed the target completely. Modern competitions at this level frequently now employ a moving backdrop specifically to track multiple shots through the same hole. If his assertion was correct, Patton would likely have won an Olympic medal in the event. The judges&#x27; ruling was upheld. Patton&#x27;s only comment on the matter was:

=== Sword design ===

Following the 1912 Olympics, Patton traveled to Saumur, France, where he learned fencing techniques from Adjutant Charles Cléry, a French &quot;master of arms&quot; and instructor of fencing at the cavalry school there. Bringing these lessons back to Fort Myer, Patton redesigned saber combat doctrine for the U.S. cavalry, favoring thrusting attacks over the standard slashing maneuver and designing a new sword for such attacks. He was temporarily assigned to the Office of the Army Chief of Staff, and in 1913, the first 20,000 of the Model 1913 Cavalry Saber—popularly known as the &quot;Patton saber&quot;—were ordered.

Patton then returned to Saumur to learn advanced techniques before bringing his skills to the Mounted Service School at Fort Riley, Kansas, where he would be both a student and a fencing instructor. He was the first Army officer to be designated &quot;Master of the Sword&quot;, a title denoting the school&#x27;s top instructor in swordsmanship. Arriving in September 1913, he taught fencing to other cavalry officers, many of whom were senior to him in rank.

Patton graduated from this school in June 1915. He was originally intended to return to the 15th Cavalry, which was bound for the Philippines. Fearing this assignment would dead-end his career, Patton travelled to Washington, D.C., during 11 days of leave and convinced influential friends to arrange a reassignment for him to the 8th Cavalry at Fort Bliss, Texas, anticipating that instability in Mexico might boil over into a full-scale civil war. In the meantime, Patton was selected to participate in the 1916 Summer Olympics, but that Olympiad was cancelled due to World War I.

== Pancho Villa Expedition ==
In 1915, Lieutenant Patton was assigned to border patrol duty with A Troop of the 8th Cavalry, based in Sierra Blanca. During his time in the town, Patton took to wearing his M1911 Colt .45 in his belt rather than a holster. His firearm discharged accidentally one night in a saloon, so he swapped it for an ivory-handled Colt Single Action Army revolver, a weapon that would later become an icon of Patton&#x27;s image.

In March 1916, Mexican forces loyal to Pancho Villa crossed into New Mexico and raided the border town of Columbus. The violence in Columbus killed several Americans. In response, the U.S. launched the Pancho Villa Expedition into Mexico. Chagrined to discover that his unit would not participate, Patton appealed to expedition commander John J. Pershing, and was named his personal aide for the expedition. This meant that Patton would have some role in organizing the effort, and his eagerness and dedication to the task impressed Pershing. Patton modeled much of his leadership style after Pershing, who favored strong, decisive actions and commanding from the front. As an aide, Patton oversaw the logistics of Pershing&#x27;s transportation and acted as his personal courier.
In mid-April, Patton asked Pershing for the opportunity to command troops, and was assigned to Troop C of the 13th Cavalry to assist in the manhunt for Villa and his subordinates. His initial combat experience came on 14 May 1916, in what would become the first motorized attack in the history of U.S. warfare. A force of ten soldiers and two civilian guides, under Patton&#x27;s command, with the 6th Infantry in three Dodge touring cars surprised three of Villa&#x27;s men during a foraging expedition, killing Julio Cárdenas and two of his guards. It was not clear if Patton personally killed any of the men, but he was known to have wounded all three. The incident garnered Patton both Pershing&#x27;s good favor and widespread media attention as a &quot;bandit killer&quot;. Shortly after, he was promoted to first lieutenant while a part of the 10th Cavalry on 23 May 1916. Patton remained in Mexico until the end of the year. President Woodrow Wilson forbade the expedition from conducting aggressive patrols deeper into Mexico, so it remained encamped in the Mexican border states for much of that time. In October Patton briefly retired to California after being burned by an exploding gas lamp. He returned from the expedition permanently in February 1917.

== World War I ==
After the Villa Expedition, Patton was detailed to Front Royal, Virginia, to oversee horse procurement for the army, but Pershing intervened on his behalf. After the United States entered World War I, in April 1917, and Pershing was named commander of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) on the Western Front, Patton requested to join his staff. Patton was promoted to captain on 15 May 1917, and left for Europe, among the 180 men of Pershing&#x27;s advance party which departed 28 May and arrived in Liverpool, England, on 8 June. Taken as Pershing&#x27;s personal aide, Patton oversaw the training of American troops in Paris until September, then moved to Chaumont and was assigned as a post adjutant, commanding the headquarters company overseeing the base. Patton was dissatisfied with the post and began to take an interest in tanks, as Pershing sought to give him command of an infantry battalion. While in a hospital for jaundice, Patton met Colonel Fox Conner, who encouraged him to work with tanks instead of infantry.

On 10 November 1917, Patton was assigned to establish the AEF Light Tank School. He left Paris and reported to the French Army&#x27;s tank training school at Champlieu near Orrouy, where he drove a Renault FT light tank. On 20 November, the British launched an offensive towards the important rail center of Cambrai, using an unprecedented number of tanks. At the conclusion of his tour on 1 December, Patton went to Albert, from Cambrai, to be briefed on the results of this attack by the chief of staff of the British Tank Corps, Colonel J. F. C. Fuller. On the way back to Paris, he visited the Renault factory to observe French tanks being manufactured. Patton was promoted to major on 26 January 1918. He received the first ten tanks on 23 March 1918, at the tank school at Bourg, a small village close to Langres, Haute-Marne département. The only US soldier with tank-driving experience, Patton personally backed seven of the tanks off the train. In the post, Patton trained tank crews to operate in support of infantry, and promoted its acceptance among reluctant infantry officers. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 3 April 1918, and attended the Command and General Staff College in Langres.

In August 1918, he was placed in charge of the U.S. 1st Provisional Tank Brigade (redesignated the 304th Tank Brigade on 6 November 1918). Patton&#x27;s Light Tank Brigade was part of Colonel Samuel Rockenbach&#x27;s Tank Corps, part of the American First Army. Personally overseeing the logistics of the tanks in their first combat use by U.S. forces, and reconnoitering the target area for their first attack himself, Patton ordered that no U.S. tank be surrendered. Patton commanded American-crewed Renault FT tanks at the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, leading the tanks from the front for much of their attack, which began on 12 September. He walked in front of the tanks into the German-held village of Essey, and rode on top of a tank during the attack into Pannes, seeking to inspire his men.

While outside the village of Essey he had his first chance meeting with Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur, then commanding a brigade of the 42nd &quot;Rainbow&quot; Division, who, at just thirty-eight, was already one of the most highly decorated officers in the AEF, and with whom Patton would serve later in his career.

Patton&#x27;s brigade was then moved to support I Corps for the upcoming Meuse–Argonne offensive, which began on September 26. He personally led a troop of tanks through thick fog as they advanced into German lines. Around 09:00, Patton was wounded while leading six men and a tank in an attack on German machine guns near the town of Cheppy. His orderly, Private First Class Joe Angelo, saved Patton, for which he was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). Patton commanded the battle from a shell hole for another hour before being evacuated. Although the 35th Division (of which Patton&#x27;s tank troop was a component) eventually captured Varennes, it did so with heavy losses. Trying to move his reserve tanks forward, Patton relates that he might have killed one of his own men, stating: &quot;Some of my reserve tanks were stuck by some trenches. So I went back and made some Americans hiding in the trenches dig a passage. I think I killed one man here. He would not work so I hit him over the head with a shovel.&quot;

Patton stopped at a rear command post to submit his report before heading to a hospital. Sereno E. Brett, commander of the U.S. 326th Tank Battalion, took command of the brigade in Patton&#x27;s absence. Patton wrote in a letter to his wife: &quot;The bullet went into the front of my left leg and came out just at the crack of my bottom about two inches to the left of my rectum. It was fired at about so made a hole about the size of a [silver] dollar where it came out.&quot;

While recuperating from his wound, Patton was promoted to temporary colonel in the Tank Corps of the U.S. National Army on 17 October. He returned to duty on 28 October but saw no further action before hostilities ended on his 33rd birthday with the armistice of 11 November 1918. For his actions in Cheppy, Patton received the Silver Star, later upgraded to the DSC. The citation for the medal read:

For his leadership of the tank brigade and tank school, he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal, the citation for which reads:

In addition, he was also awarded the Purple Heart for his combat wounds after the decoration was created in 1932.

== Inter-war years ==

Patton left France for New York City on 2 March 1919. After the war, he was assigned to Camp Meade, Maryland, and reverted to his permanent rank of captain on 30 June 1920, though he was promoted to major again the next day. Patton was given temporary duty in Washington D.C. that year to serve on a committee writing a manual on tank operations. During this time he developed a belief that tanks should be used not as infantry support, but rather as an independent fighting force. Patton supported the M1919 design created by J. Walter Christie, a project which was shelved due to financial considerations. While on duty in Washington, D.C., in 1919, Patton met Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would play an enormous role in Patton&#x27;s future career. During and following Patton&#x27;s assignment in Hawaii, he and Eisenhower corresponded frequently. Patton sent notes and assistance to help Eisenhower graduate from the General Staff College. With Christie, Eisenhower, and a handful of other officers, Patton pushed for more development of armored warfare in the interwar era. These thoughts resonated with Secretary of War Dwight Davis, but the limited military budget and prevalence of already-established Infantry and Cavalry branches meant the U.S. would not develop its armored corps much until 1940.

On 30 September 1920, then-Major Patton relinquished command of the 304th Tank Brigade and was reassigned to Fort Myer as commander of 3rd Squadron, 3rd Cavalry. Loathing duty as a peacetime staff officer, he spent much time writing technical papers and giving speeches on his combat experiences at the General Staff College.

In July 1921 Patton became a member of the American Legion Tank Corps Post No. 19. Maj. Patton led the rescue effort after the January 1922 blizzard destroyed the Knickerbocker Theatre in D.C. From 1922 to mid-1923 he attended the Field Officer&#x27;s Course at the Cavalry School at Fort Riley, then he attended the Command and General Staff College from mid-1923 to mid-1924, graduating 25th out of 248. In August 1923, Patton saved several children from drowning when they fell off a yacht during a boating trip off Salem, Massachusetts. He was awarded the Silver Lifesaving Medal for this action. He was temporarily appointed to the General Staff Corps in Boston, Massachusetts, before being reassigned as G-1 and G-2 of the Hawaiian Division at Schofield Barracks in Honolulu in March 1925.

Patton was made G-3 of the Hawaiian Division for several months, before being transferred in May 1927 to the Office of the Chief of Cavalry in Washington, D.C., where he began to develop the concepts of mechanized warfare. A short-lived experiment to merge infantry, cavalry and artillery into a combined arms force was cancelled after U.S. Congress removed funding. Patton left this office in 1931, returned to Massachusetts and attended the Army War College, becoming a &quot;Distinguished Graduate&quot; in June 1932.

In July 1932, Patton (still a Major) was executive officer of the 3rd Cavalry, which was ordered to Washington by Army Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur. Patton took command of the 600 troops of the 3rd Cavalry, and on 28 July, MacArthur ordered Patton&#x27;s troops to advance on protesting veterans known as the &quot;Bonus Army&quot; with tear gas and bayonets. Patton was dissatisfied with MacArthur&#x27;s conduct, as he recognized the legitimacy of the veterans&#x27; complaints and had himself earlier refused to issue the order to employ armed force to disperse the veterans. Patton later stated that, though he found the duty &quot;most distasteful&quot;, he also felt that putting the marchers down prevented an insurrection and saved lives and property. He personally led the 3rd Cavalry down Pennsylvania Avenue, dispersing the protesters. Patton also encountered his former orderly, Joe Angelo, as one of the marchers and forcibly ordered him away, fearing such a meeting might make the headlines.

Patton was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the regular Army on 1 March 1934, and was transferred to the Hawaiian Division in early 1935 to serve as G-2. During this posting, Patton feuded with his commander, Hugh Aloysius Drum, another Pershing protégé. At a polo match in which Patton was playing, Drum was among the spectators and rebuked Patton for his use of angry profanity during the game. The civilian players, who were members of Hawaii&#x27;s wealthy elite on friendly terms with the equally wealthy and elite Patton, humiliated Drum by standing up for Patton. Patton followed the growing hostility and conquest aspirations of the militant Japanese leadership. He wrote a plan to intern the Japanese living in the islands in the event of an attack as a result of the atrocities carried out by Japanese soldiers on the Chinese in the Sino-Japanese war. In 1937 he wrote a paper with the title &quot;Surprise&quot; which predicted, with what D&#x27;Este termed &quot;chilling accuracy&quot;, a surprise attack by the Japanese on Hawaii. Depressed at the lack of prospects for new conflict, Patton took to drinking heavily and allegedly began a brief affair with his 21-year-old niece by marriage, Jean Gordon. This supposed affair distressed his wife and nearly resulted in their separation. Patton&#x27;s attempts to win her back were said to be among the few instances in which he willingly showed remorse or submission.

Patton continued playing polo and sailing in this time. After sailing back to Los Angeles for extended leave in 1937, he was kicked by a horse and fractured his leg. Patton developed phlebitis from the injury, which nearly killed him. The incident almost forced Patton out of active service, but a six-month administrative assignment in the Academic Department at the Cavalry School at Fort Riley helped him to recover. Patton was promoted to colonel on 24 July 1938, and given command of the 5th Cavalry at Fort Clark, Texas, for six months, a post he relished, but he was reassigned to Fort Myer again in December as commander of the 3rd Cavalry. There, he met the Army&#x27;s Deputy Chief of Staff, George C. Marshall, who was so impressed with him that Marshall considered Patton a prime candidate for promotion to general. In peacetime, though, he would remain a colonel to remain eligible to command a regiment. When Malin Craig retired as Chief of Staff of the United States Army in 1939, Drum was a candidate to succeed him. Drum wanted the position badly enough to set aside his feud with Patton and ask Patton to intercede with the retired but still influential Pershing. Despite these efforts, Drum was passed over in favor of Marshall.

Patton had a personal schooner named &quot;When and If&quot;. The schooner was designed by famous naval architect John G. Alden and built in 1939. The schooner&#x27;s name comes from Patton saying he would sail it &quot;when and if&quot; he returned from war.

== World War II ==

Following the German Army&#x27;s invasion of Poland and the outbreak of World War II in Europe in September 1939, the U.S. military entered a period of mobilization, and Colonel Patton sought to build up the power of U.S. armored forces. During maneuvers the Third Army conducted in 1940, Patton served as an umpire, where he met Adna R. Chaffee Jr. and the two formulated recommendations to develop an armored force. Chaffee was named commander of this force, and created the 1st and 2nd Armored Divisions as well as the first combined arms doctrine. He named Patton commander of the 2nd Armored Brigade, part of the 2nd Armored Division. The division was one of few organized as a heavy formation with many tanks, and Patton was in charge of its training. Patton was promoted to brigadier general on 2 October, made acting division commander in November when Charles L. Scott assumed command of I Armored Corps, and on 4 April 1941, was promoted again to major general as Commanding General (CG) of the 2nd Armored Division. As Chaffee stepped down from command of the I Armored Corps, Patton became the most prominent figure in U.S. armor doctrine. In December 1940, he staged a high-profile mass exercise in which 1,000 tanks and vehicles were driven from Columbus, Georgia, to Panama City, Florida, and back. He repeated the exercise with his entire division of 1,300 vehicles the next month. Patton earned a pilot&#x27;s license and, during these maneuvers, observed the movements of his vehicles from the air to find ways to deploy them effectively in combat. His exploits earned him a spot on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

General Patton led the division during the Tennessee Maneuvers in June 1941, and was lauded for his leadership, executing 48 hours&#x27; worth of planned objectives in only nine. During the September Louisiana Maneuvers, his division was part of the losing Red Army in Phase I, but in Phase II was assigned to the Blue Army. His division executed a end run around the Red Army and &quot;captured&quot; Shreveport, Louisiana. During the October–November Carolina Maneuvers, Patton&#x27;s division captured the now Lieutenant General Drum, who served as the commander of the opposing army. The general was greatly embarrassed and became the subject of mockery. After soldiers from Isaac D. White&#x27;s battalion detained Drum, the exercise umpires ruled that the circumstances would not have transpired in combat, so he was allowed to return to his headquarters, enabling the exercise to continue and for Drum to save face. Despite the umpires&#x27; actions, the incident indicated to senior leaders that Hugh Drum might not be prepared to command large bodies of troops under the modern battlefield conditions the Army would face in World War II, thus, he was not considered for field command.

On 15 January 1942, a few weeks after the American entry into World War II, he succeeded Scott as commander of I Armored Corps, and the next month established the Desert Training Center in the Coachella Valley region of Riverside County in California, to run training exercises. He commenced these exercises in late 1941 and continued them into the summer of 1942. Patton chose a expanse of desert area about southeast of Palm Springs. From his first days as a commander, Patton strongly emphasized the need for armored forces to stay in constant contact with opposing forces. His instinctive preference for offensive movement was typified by an answer Patton gave to war correspondents in a 1944 press conference. In response to a question on whether the Third Army&#x27;s rapid offensive across France should be slowed to reduce the number of U.S. casualties, Patton replied, &quot;Whenever you slow anything down, you waste human lives.&quot; It was around this time that a reporter, after hearing a speech where Patton said that it took &quot;blood and brains&quot; to win in combat, began calling him &quot;blood and guts&quot;. The nickname would follow him for the rest of his life. Soldiers under his command were known at times to have quipped, &quot;our blood, his guts&quot;. Nonetheless, he was known to be admired widely by the men under his charge.

=== North African campaign ===

Under Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, Patton was assigned to help plan the Allied invasion of French North Africa as part of Operation Torch in the summer of 1942. Patton commanded the Western Task Force, consisting of 33,000 men in 100 ships, in landings centered on Casablanca, Morocco. The landings, which took place on 8 November 1942, were opposed by Vichy French forces, but Patton&#x27;s men quickly gained a beachhead and pushed through fierce resistance. Casablanca fell on 11 November and Patton negotiated an armistice with French General Charles Noguès. The Sultan of Morocco was so impressed that he presented Patton with the Order of Ouissam Alaouite, with the citation &quot;Les Lions dans leurs tanières tremblent en le voyant approcher&quot; (The lions in their dens tremble at his approach). Patton oversaw the conversion of Casablanca into a military port and hosted the Casablanca Conference in January 1943.

On 6 March 1943, following the defeat of the U.S. II Corps by the German Afrika Korps, commanded by &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erwin Rommel, at the Battle of Kasserine Pass, Patton replaced Major General Lloyd Fredendall as Commanding General of the II Corps and was promoted to lieutenant general. Soon thereafter, he had Major General Omar Bradley reassigned to his corps as its deputy commander. With orders to take the battered and demoralized formation into action in 10 days&#x27; time, Patton immediately introduced sweeping changes, ordering all soldiers to wear clean, pressed and complete uniforms, establishing rigorous schedules, and requiring strict adherence to military protocol. He continuously moved throughout the command talking with men, seeking to shape them into effective soldiers. He pushed them hard, and sought to reward them well for their accomplishments. His uncompromising leadership style is evidenced by his orders for an attack on a hill position near Gafsa, in which he ended by reportedly saying, &quot;I expect to see such casualties among officers, particularly staff officers, as will convince me that a serious effort has been made to capture this objective.&quot;

Patton&#x27;s training was effective, and on 17 March, the U.S. 1st Infantry Division took Gafsa participating in the indecisive Battle of El Guettar, and pushing a German and Italian armored force back twice. In the meantime, on 5 April, he removed Major General Orlando Ward, commanding the 1st Armored Division, after its lackluster performance at Maknassy against numerically inferior German forces. Advancing on Gabès, Patton&#x27;s corps pressured the Mareth Line. During this time, he reported to British General Sir Harold Alexander, commander of the 18th Army Group, and came into conflict with Air Vice Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham about the lack of close air support being provided for his troops. By the time his force reached Gabès, the Germans had abandoned it. He then relinquished command of II Corps to Bradley, and returned to the I Armored Corps in Casablanca to help plan Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. Fearing U.S. troops would be sidelined, he convinced British commanders to allow them to continue fighting through to the end of the Tunisia Campaign before leaving on this new assignment.

=== Sicily campaign ===

For Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily, Patton was to command the Seventh United States Army, dubbed the Western Task Force, in landings at Gela, Scoglitti and Licata to support landings by General Sir Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s British Eighth Army. Patton&#x27;s I Armored Corps was officially redesignated the Seventh Army just before his force of 90,000 landed before dawn on D-Day, 10 July 1943, on beaches near the town of Licata. The armada was hampered by wind and weather, but despite this the three U.S. infantry divisions involved, the 3rd, 1st, and 45th, secured their respective beaches. They then repulsed counterattacks at Gela, where Patton personally led his troops against German reinforcements from the Hermann Göring Division.

Initially ordered to protect the British forces&#x27; left flank, Patton was granted permission by Alexander to take Palermo after Montgomery&#x27;s forces became bogged down on the road to Messina. As part of a provisional corps under Major General Geoffrey Keyes, the 3rd Infantry Division under Major General Lucian Truscott covered in 72 hours, arriving at Palermo on 21 July. Patton then set his sights on Messina. He sought an amphibious assault, but it was delayed by lack of landing craft, and his troops did not land at Santo Stefano until 8 August, by which time the Germans and Italians had already evacuated the bulk of their troops to mainland Italy. He ordered more landings on 10 August by the 3rd Infantry Division, which took heavy casualties but pushed the German forces back, and hastened the advance on Messina. A third landing was completed on 16 August, and by 22:00 that day Messina fell to his forces. By the end of the battle, the 200,000-man Seventh Army had suffered 7,500 casualties, and killed or captured 113,000 Axis troops and destroyed 3,500 vehicles. Still, 40,000 German and 70,000 Italian troops escaped to Italy with 10,000 vehicles.

Patton&#x27;s conduct in this campaign met with several controversies. He was also frequently in disagreement with Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. and Theodore Roosevelt Jr. though often then conceding, to their relief, in line with Bradley&#x27;s view.

When Alexander sent a transmission on 19 July limiting Patton&#x27;s attack on Messina, his chief of staff, Brigadier General Hobart R. Gay, claimed the message was &quot;lost in transmission&quot; until Messina had fallen.

In an incident on 22 July, while a U.S. armored column was under attack from German aircraft, he shot and killed a pair of mules that had stopped while pulling a cart across a bridge. The cart was blocking the way of the column. When their Sicilian owner protested, Patton attacked him with a walking stick and had his troops push the two mule carcasses off the bridge.

When informed of the Biscari massacre of prisoners, which was by troops under his command, Patton wrote in his diary, &quot;I told Bradley that it was probably an exaggeration, but in any case to tell the officer to certify that the dead men were snipers or had attempted to escape or something, as it would make a stink in the press and also would make the civilians mad. Anyhow, they are dead, so nothing can be done about it.&quot; Bradley refused Patton&#x27;s suggestions. Patton later changed his mind. After he learned that the 45th Division&#x27;s Inspector General found &quot;no provocation on the part of the prisoners ... They had been slaughtered&quot; Patton is reported to have said: &quot;Try the bastards.&quot;

Two soldiers were tried for the Biscari massacre, both of whom claimed in their defense that they were acting under orders from Patton not to take prisoners if enemy combatants continued to resist within two hundred yards of their position. Major General Everett Hughes, an old friend of Patton&#x27;s, defended him, asserting that Patton had not &quot;at any time advocated the destruction of prisoners of war under any circumstances&quot;. James J. Weingartner argues that Patton&#x27;s innocence in inciting violence against prisoners of war is uncertain, stating that

No official action was taken against Patton for any complicity in the massacre.

=== Slapping incidents and aftermath ===
Two high-profile incidents of Patton striking subordinates during the Sicily campaign attracted national controversy following the end of the campaign. On 3 August 1943, Patton slapped and verbally abused Private Charles H. Kuhl at an evacuation hospital in Nicosia after he had been found to suffer from &quot;battle fatigue&quot;. On 10 August, Patton slapped Private Paul G. Bennett under similar circumstances. Ordering both soldiers back to the front lines, Patton railed against cowardice and issued orders to his commanders to discipline any soldier making similar complaints.

Word of the incident reached Eisenhower, who privately reprimanded Patton and insisted he apologize. Patton apologized to both soldiers individually, as well as to doctors who witnessed the incidents, and later to all of the soldiers under his command in several speeches. Eisenhower suppressed the incident in the media, but in November journalist Drew Pearson revealed it on his radio program. Criticism of Patton in the United States was harsh, and included members of Congress and former generals, Pershing among them. The views of the general public remained mixed on the matter, and eventually Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson stated that Patton must be retained as a commander because of the need for his &quot;aggressive, winning leadership in the bitter battles which are to come before final victory.&quot;

Patton did not command a force in combat for 11 months. In September, Bradley, who was Patton&#x27;s junior in both rank and experience, was selected to command the First United States Army forming in England to prepare for Operation Overlord. This decision had been made before the slapping incidents were made public, but Patton blamed them for his being denied the command. Eisenhower felt the invasion of Europe was too important to risk any uncertainty, and that the slapping incidents had been an example of Patton&#x27;s inability to exercise discipline and self-control. While Eisenhower and Marshall both considered Patton to be a skilled combat commander, they felt Bradley was less impulsive and less prone to making mistakes. On 26 January 1944, Patton was formally given command of the U.S. Third Army in England, a newly formed field Army, and he was assigned to prepare its inexperienced soldiers for combat in Europe. This duty kept Patton busy during the first half of 1944.

=== Ghost Army ===


The German High Command had more respect for Patton than for any other Allied commander and considered him to be central to any plan to invade Europe from England. Because of this, Patton was made a prominent figure in the deception scheme Operation Fortitude during the first half of 1944. Through the British network of double-agents, the Allies fed German intelligence a steady stream of false reports about troop sightings and that Patton had been named commander of the First United States Army Group (FUSAG), all designed to convince the Germans that Patton was preparing this massive command for an invasion at Pas de Calais. FUSAG was in reality an intricately constructed fictitious army of decoys, props, and fake radio signal traffic based around Dover to mislead German reconnaissance planes and to make Axis leaders believe that a large force was massing there. This helped to mask the real location of the invasion in Normandy. Patton was ordered to keep a low profile to deceive the Germans into thinking that he was in Dover throughout early 1944, when he was actually training the Third Army. As a result of Operation Fortitude, the German 15th Army remained at the Pas de Calais to defend against Patton&#x27;s supposed attack. So strong was their conviction that this was the main landing area that the German army held its position there even after the invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944, believing it to be a diversionary force. Patton flew to France a month later, and then returned to combat command.

=== Normandy breakout offensive ===

Sailing to Normandy throughout July, Patton&#x27;s Third Army formed on the extreme right (west) of the Allied land forces, and became operational at noon on 1 August 1944, under Bradley&#x27;s Twelfth United States Army Group. The Third Army simultaneously attacked west into Brittany, south, east toward the Seine, and north, assisting in trapping several hundred thousand German soldiers in the Falaise Pocket between Falaise and Argentan.

Patton&#x27;s strategy with his army favored speed and aggressive offensive action, though his forces saw less opposition than did the other three Allied field armies in the initial weeks of its advance. The Third Army typically employed forward scout units to determine enemy strength and positions. Self-propelled artillery moved with the spearhead units and was sited well forward, ready to engage protected German positions with indirect fire. Light aircraft such as the Piper L-4 Cub served as artillery spotters and provided airborne reconnaissance. Once located, the armored infantry would attack using tanks as infantry support. Other armored units would then break through enemy lines and exploit any subsequent breach, constantly pressuring withdrawing German forces to prevent them from regrouping and reforming a cohesive defensive line. The U.S. armor advanced using reconnaissance by fire, and the .50 caliber M2 Browning heavy machine gun proved effective in this role, often flushing out and killing German panzerfaust teams waiting in ambush as well as breaking up German infantry assaults against the armored infantry.

The speed of the advance forced Patton&#x27;s units to rely heavily on air reconnaissance and tactical air support. The Third Army had by far more military intelligence (G-2) officers at headquarters specifically designated to coordinate air strikes than any other army. Its attached close air support group was XIX Tactical Air Command, commanded by Brigadier General Otto P. Weyland. Developed originally by General Elwood Quesada of IX Tactical Air Command for the First Army in Operation Cobra, the technique of &quot;armored column cover&quot;, in which close air support was directed by an air traffic controller in one of the attacking tanks, was used extensively by the Third Army. Each column was protected by a standing patrol of three to four P-47 and P-51 fighter-bombers as a combat air patrol (CAP).

In its advance from Avranches to Argentan, the Third Army traversed in just two weeks. Patton&#x27;s force was supplemented by Ultra intelligence for which he was briefed daily by his G-2, Colonel Oscar Koch, who apprised him of German counterattacks, and where to concentrate his forces. Equally important to the advance of Third Army columns in northern France was the rapid advance of the supply echelons. Third Army logistics were overseen by Colonel Walter J. Muller, Patton&#x27;s G-4, who emphasized flexibility, improvisation, and adaptation for Third Army supply echelons so forward units could rapidly exploit a breakthrough. Patton&#x27;s rapid drive to Lorraine demonstrated his keen appreciation for the technological advantages of the U.S. Army. The major U.S. and Allied advantages were in mobility and air superiority. The U.S. Army had more trucks, more reliable tanks, and better radio communications, all of which contributed to a superior ability to operate at a rapid offensive pace.

=== Lorraine campaign ===
Patton&#x27;s Third Army was sent to Lorraine. Despite its proximity to Germany, Lorraine was not the Allies&#x27; preferred invasion route in 1944. Except for its cities of Nancy and Metz the region contained few significant military objectives. Once the Third Army had penetrated Lorraine there would still be no first-rate military objectives on entering Germany. The Saar&#x27;s industrial region, while significant, was of secondary importance when compared to the great Ruhr industrial complex farther north. Patton&#x27;s offensive came to a halt on 31 August 1944, as the Third Army ran out of fuel near the Moselle River, just outside Metz. Patton expected that the theater commander would keep fuel and supplies flowing to support his advance, but Eisenhower favored a &quot;broad front&quot; approach to the ground-war effort, believing that a single thrust would have to drop off flank protection, and would quickly lose its punch.

Still within the constraints of a very large effort overall, Eisenhower gave Montgomery and his Twenty First Army Group a higher priority for supplies for Operation Market Garden. However no supplies were diverted from Patton&#x27;s Third Army. Three British transport companies were lent to American forces on 6 August for eight days not being returned until 4 September. The Third Army exhausted its fuel supplies, however after the Market Garden operation. According to Bradley there was parity of supplies between the three allied armies, Second British, First and Third US, by mid September 1944 and according to the official US Army History as cited on page 52 in Hugh Cole&#x27;s book, The Lorraine Campaign, &quot;by 10th September the period of critical [gasoline] shortage had ended&quot;. This was a whole week before Market Garden took place. The gasoline drought was the end of August/beginning of September.

The French rail network greatly aided the speed of the Third Army&#x27;s logistical recovery, which was repaired and quickly put to use. In eastern France the rail network was relatively undamaged by Allied aircraft and had been abandoned almost intact by the retreating Germans. The Third Army brought its railheads as far forward as Nancy. The French themselves operated the trains providing rolling stock and trained personnel to supplement the Third Army.

Patton believed his forces were close enough to the Siegfried Line that he remarked to Bradley that with 400,000 gallons of gasoline he could be in Germany within two days. In late September, a large German Panzer counterattack sent expressly to stop the advance of Patton&#x27;s Third Army was defeated by the U.S. 4th Armored Division at the Battle of Arracourt. The German commanders believed this was because their counterattack had been successful.

The halt of the Third Army during the month of September was enough to allow the Germans to strengthen the fortress of Metz. Patton&#x27;s forces reached the fortress at Metz on 5 September 1944, forcing a German surrender on 21 November 1944, taking over 10 weeks in the Battle of Metz with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Also an attempt by Patton to seize Fort Driant just south of Metz was defeated.

Patton&#x27;s decisions in taking this city were criticized. German commanders interviewed after the war noted he could have bypassed the city and moved north to Luxembourg where he would have been able to cut off the German Seventh Army. The German commander of Metz, General Hermann Balck, also noted that a more direct attack would have resulted in a more decisive Allied victory in the city. Historian Carlo D&#x27;Este later wrote that the Lorraine campaign was one of Patton&#x27;s least successful, faulting him for not deploying his divisions more aggressively and decisively. Patton remained frustrated at the lack of progress of his forces. From 8 November to 15 December, his army advanced no more than .

In &quot;The Lorraine Campaign An Overview, September–December 1944&quot;, on page 36, Dr. Christopher R. Gabel of the Combat Studies Institute stated in February, 1985:

Was the Lorraine campaign an American victory? From September through November, Third Army claimed to have inflicted over 180,000 casualties on the enemy. But to capture the province of Lorraine, a problem which involved an advance of only 40 to 60 air miles, Third Army required over 3 months and suffered 50,000 casualties, approximately one-third of the total number of casualties it sustained in the entire European war.

=== Battle of the Bulge ===

In December 1944, the German army, under the command of German Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, launched a last-ditch offensive across Belgium, Luxembourg, and northeastern France. On 16 December 1944, it massed 29 divisions totaling 250,000 men at a weak point in the Allied lines, and during the early stages of the ensuing Battle of the Bulge, made significant headway towards the Meuse River during a severe winter. Eisenhower called a meeting of all senior Allied commanders on the Western Front at a headquarters near Verdun on the morning of 19 December to plan strategy and a response to the German assault.

At the time, Patton&#x27;s Third Army was engaged in heavy fighting near Saarbrücken. Guessing the intent of the Allied command meeting, Patton ordered his staff to make three separate operational contingency orders to disengage elements of the Third Army from its present position and begin offensive operations toward several objectives in the area of the bulge occupied by German forces. At the Supreme Command conference, Eisenhower led the meeting, which was attended by Patton, Bradley, General Jacob Devers, Major General Kenneth Strong, Deputy Supreme Commander Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder, and several staff officers. When Eisenhower asked Patton how long it would take him to disengage six divisions of his Third Army and commence a counterattack north to relieve the U.S. 101st Airborne Division which had been trapped at Bastogne, Patton replied, &quot;As soon as you&#x27;re through with me.&quot; Patton then clarified that he had already worked up an operational order for a counterattack by three full divisions on 21 December, then only 48 hours away. Eisenhower was incredulous: &quot;Don&#x27;t be fatuous, George. If you try to go that early you won&#x27;t have all three divisions ready and you&#x27;ll go piecemeal.&quot; Patton replied that his staff already had a contingency operations order ready to go. Still unconvinced, Eisenhower ordered Patton to attack the morning of 22 December, using at least three divisions.

Patton left the conference room, phoned his command, and uttered two words: &quot;Play ball.&quot; This code phrase initiated a prearranged operational order with Patton&#x27;s staff, mobilizing three divisions—the 4th Armored Division, the 80th Infantry Division, and the 26th Infantry Division—from the Third Army and moving them north toward Bastogne. In all, Patton would reposition six full divisions, U.S. III Corps and U.S. XII Corps, from their positions on the Saar River front along a line stretching from Bastogne to Diekirch and to Echternach, the town in Luxembourg that had been at the southern end of the initial &quot;Bulge&quot; front line on 16 December. Within a few days, more than 133,000 Third Army vehicles were rerouted into an offensive that covered an average distance of over per vehicle, followed by support echelons carrying of supplies.

On 21 December, Patton met with Bradley to review the impending advance, starting the meeting by remarking, &quot;Brad, this time the Kraut&#x27;s stuck his head in the meat grinder, and I&#x27;ve got hold of the handle.&quot; Patton then argued that his Third Army should attack toward Koblenz, cutting off the bulge at the base and trap the entirety of the German armies involved in the offensive. After briefly considering this, Bradley vetoed it, since he was less concerned about killing large numbers of Germans than he was in arranging for the relief of Bastogne before it was overrun. Desiring good weather for his advance, which would permit close ground support by U.S. Army Air Forces tactical aircraft, Patton ordered the Third Army chaplain, Colonel James Hugh O&#x27;Neill, to compose a suitable prayer. He responded with:
When the weather cleared soon after, Patton awarded O&#x27;Neill a Bronze Star Medal on the spot.

On 26 December 1944, the first spearhead units of the Third Army&#x27;s 4th Armored Division reached Bastogne, opening a corridor for relief and resupply of the besieged forces. Patton&#x27;s ability to disengage six divisions from front line combat during the middle of winter, then wheel north to relieve Bastogne was one of his most remarkable achievements during the war. He later wrote that the relief of Bastogne was &quot;the most brilliant operation we have thus far performed, and it is in my opinion the outstanding achievement of the war. This is my biggest battle.&quot;

=== Advance into Germany ===
By February, the Germans were in full retreat. On 23 February 1945, the U.S. 94th Infantry Division crossed the Saar River and established a vital bridgehead at Serrig, through which Patton pushed units into the Saarland. Patton had insisted upon an immediate crossing of the Saar River against the advice of his officers. Historians such as Charles Whiting have criticized this strategy as unnecessarily aggressive.

Once again, Patton found other commands given priority on gasoline and supplies. To obtain these, Third Army ordnance units passed themselves off as First Army personnel and in one incident they secured thousands of gallons of gasoline from a First Army dump. Between 29 January and 22 March, the Third Army took Trier, Koblenz, Bingen, Worms, Mainz, Kaiserslautern, and Ludwigshafen, killing or wounding 99,000 and capturing 140,112 German soldiers, which represented virtually all of the remnants of the German First and Seventh Armies. An example of Patton&#x27;s sarcastic wit was broadcast when he received orders to bypass Trier, as it had been decided that four divisions would be needed to capture it. When the message arrived, Trier had already fallen. Patton rather caustically replied: &quot;Have taken Trier with two divisions. Do you want me to give it back?&quot;

The Third Army began crossing the Rhine River after constructing a pontoon bridge on 22 March, two weeks after the First Army crossed it at Remagen, and Patton slipped a division across the river that evening. Patton later boasted he had urinated into the river as he crossed.
On 26 March 1945, Patton sent Task Force Baum, consisting of 314 men, 16 tanks, and assorted other vehicles, behind German lines to liberate the prisoner of war camp OFLAG XIII-B, near Hammelburg. Patton knew that one of the inmates was his son-in-law, Lieutenant Colonel John K. Waters. The raid was a failure, and only 35 men made it back; the rest were either killed or captured, and all 57 vehicles were lost. Patton reported this attempt to liberate Oflag XIII-B as the only mistake he made during World War II. When Eisenhower learned of the secret mission, he was furious. Patton later said he felt the correct decision would have been to send a Combat Command, which is a force about three times larger.

By April, resistance against the Third Army was tapering off, and the forces&#x27; main efforts turned to managing some 400,000 German prisoners of war. On 14 April 1945, Patton was promoted to general, a promotion long advocated by Stimson in recognition of Patton&#x27;s battle accomplishments during 1944. Later that month, Patton, Bradley, and Eisenhower toured the Merkers salt mine as well as the Ohrdruf concentration camp, and seeing the conditions of the camp firsthand caused Patton great disgust. Third Army was ordered toward Bavaria and Czechoslovakia, anticipating a last stand by German forces there. He was reportedly appalled to learn that the Red Army would take Berlin, feeling that the Soviet Union was a threat to the U.S. Army&#x27;s advance to Pilsen, but was stopped by Eisenhower from reaching Prague, Czechoslovakia, before V-E Day on 8 May and the end of the war in Europe.

In its advance from the Rhine to the Elbe, Patton&#x27;s Third Army, which numbered between 250,000 and 300,000 men at any given time, captured of German territory. Its losses were 2,102 killed, 7,954 wounded, and 1,591 missing. German losses in the fighting against the Third Army totaled 20,100 killed, 47,700 wounded, and 653,140 captured.

Between becoming operational in Normandy on 1 August 1944, and the end of hostilities on 9 May 1945, the Third Army was in continuous combat for 281 days. In that time, it crossed 24 major rivers and captured of territory, including more than 12,000 cities and towns. The Third Army claimed to have killed, wounded, or captured 1,811,388 German soldiers, six times its strength in personnel. Fuller&#x27;s review of Third Army records differs only in the number of enemies killed and wounded, stating that between 1 August 1944 and 9 May 1945, 47,500 of the enemy were killed, 115,700 wounded, and 1,280,688 captured, for a total of 1,443,888.

== Postwar ==

Patton asked for a command in the Pacific Theater of Operations, begging Marshall to bring him to that war in any way possible. Marshall said he would be able to do so only if the Chinese secured a major port for his entry, an unlikely scenario. In mid-May, Patton flew to Paris, then London for rest. On 7 June, he arrived in Bedford, Massachusetts, for extended leave with his family, and was greeted by thousands of spectators. Patton then drove to Hatch Memorial Shell and spoke to some 20,000, including a crowd of 400 wounded Third Army veterans. In this speech he aroused some controversy among the Gold Star Mothers when he stated that a man who dies in battle is &quot;frequently a fool&quot;, adding that the wounded are heroes. Patton spent time in Boston before visiting and speaking in Denver and visiting Los Angeles, where he spoke to a crowd of 100,000 at the Memorial Coliseum. On 14 June 1945, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson decided that Patton would not be sent to the Pacific but would return to Europe in an occupation army assignment. Patton made a final stop in Washington, D.C., before returning to Europe in July to serve in the occupation forces.

Patton was appointed as military governor of Bavaria, where he led the Third Army in denazification efforts. Patton was particularly upset when learning of the end of the war against Japan, writing in his diary, &quot;Yet another war has come to an end, and with it my usefulness to the world.&quot; Unhappy with his position and depressed by his belief that he would never fight in another war, Patton&#x27;s behavior and statements became increasingly erratic. Various explanations beyond his disappointments have been proposed for Patton&#x27;s behavior at this point. Carlo D&#x27;Este wrote that &quot;it seems virtually inevitable ... that Patton experienced some type of brain damage from too many head injuries&quot; from a lifetime of numerous auto- and horse-related accidents, especially one suffered while playing polo in 1936.

Patton&#x27;s niece Jean Gordon spent some time together with him in London in 1944, and in Bavaria in 1945. Patton repeatedly boasted of his sexual success with Gordon, and his wife and family plainly believed that the two were lovers. Some of his biographers are skeptical. Hirshson said that the relationship was casual. Showalter believes that Patton, under severe physical and psychological stress, made up claims of sexual conquest to prove his virility. D&#x27;Este agrees that Patton&#x27;s &quot;behavior suggests that in both 1936 [in Hawaii] and 1944–45, the presence of the young and attractive Jean was a means of assuaging the anxieties of a middle-aged man troubled over his virility and a fear of aging.&quot; Whether or not Gordon was sexually involved with Patton, she also loved a young married captain, who returned to his wife in September 1945, leaving Gordon despondent.

=== Denazification controversy and antisemitism ===
Patton attracted controversy as military governor when it was noted that several former Nazi Party members continued to hold political posts in the region. Privately, Patton expressed a soldier&#x27;s respect for the Germans as adversaries and a resistance to removing Nazi Party members from power. &quot;I had never heard,&quot; he wrote to his wife Bea, &quot;that we fought to de-Nazify Germany—live and learn. What we are doing is to utterly destroy the only semi-modern state in Europe so that Russia can swallow the whole ... Actually the Germans are the only decent people in Europe.&quot;

Patton, in his new role, oversaw the displaced persons camps in Bavaria, which contained a majority of Jews who had survived Germany&#x27;s concentration camps in the Holocaust. He refused to have Jewish chaplains at his headquarters. Patton decided to keep the Jews detained, according to his diary, because he thought releasing them could lead to violence and re-arrests. He also resisted Eisenhower&#x27;s orders to evict Germans from their homes in order to house Jews. After Patton accompanied Eisenhower to a Yom Kippur service in one of the camps, he referred to the Jews at the service as a &quot;stinking mass of humanity&quot;, and complaining about their hygiene, said: &quot;This happened to be the feast of Yom Kippur, so they were all collected in a large, wooden building, which they called a synagogue. It behooved General Eisenhower to make a speech to them. We entered the synagogue, which was packed with the greatest stinking bunch of humanity I have ever seen. When we got about halfway up, the head rabbi, who was dressed in a fur hat similar to that worn by Henry VIII of England and in a surplice heavily embroidered and very filthy, came down and met the General ... The smell was so terrible that I almost fainted and actually about three hours later lost my lunch as the result of remembering it ... Of course, I have seen them since the beginning and marveled that beings alleged to be made in the form of God can look the way they do or act the way they act.&quot; Patton also claimed that &quot;There is a very Semitic influence in the press.&quot; &quot;The noise against me is only the means by which the Jews and the Communists are attempting and with good success the further dismemberment of Germany.&quot; Biographer Martin Blumenson, who was Third Army Historian and also edited Patton&#x27;s papers, sums up this period tersely: &quot;Clearly, he had become delusional.&quot;

Patton continued to make numerous antisemitic comments. He remarked that displaced Jews were &quot;locusts&quot;, &quot;lower than animals&quot;, and &quot;lost to all decency&quot;. In one diary entry, he wrote that Jews were &quot;a subhuman species without any of the cultural or social refinements of our times.&quot;

=== Relieved of command ===
Patton faced questions from the press about his reluctance to denazify post-war Germany, but he noted that most of the people with experience in infrastructure management had been compelled to join the party in the war. He compared Nazis to Democrats and Republicans, bringing negative press stateside and angering Eisenhower. Eisenhower ordered him to hold a press conference correcting his statements, but Patton instead repeated them.

On 28 September 1945, Patton had a heated exchange with Eisenhower over the denazification controversy, so Eisenhower relieved him of his military governorship. He was relieved of command of the Third Army on 7 October, and he concluded his farewell remarks by saying, &quot;All good things must come to an end. The best thing that has ever happened to me thus far is the honor and privilege of having commanded the Third Army.&quot; According to Anthony Cave Brown in &quot;Bodyguard of Lies&quot;, &quot;Patton was relieved of command of the 3rd Army by Eisenhower just after the end of the war for stating publicly that America had been fighting the wrong enemy—Germany instead of Russia.&quot;

Patton&#x27;s final assignment was to command the U.S. 15th Army based in Bad Nauheim. The 15th Army at this point consisted only of a small headquarters staff working to compile a history of the war in Europe. Patton had accepted the post because of his love of history, but he quickly lost interest. He began traveling, visiting Paris, Rennes, Chartres, Brussels, Metz, Reims, Luxembourg, and Verdun. Then he went to Stockholm, where he reunited with other athletes from the 1912 Olympics. Patton decided that he would leave his post at the 15th Army and not return to Europe once he left for Christmas leave on 10 December. He intended to discuss with his wife whether he would continue in a stateside post or retire from the Army.

Eisenhower returned to the United States to become the Chief of Staff of the US Army, and Patton was appointed interim commander of US Army Europe on 11 November 1945. He served in the position until relieved by General Joseph T. McNarney on 26 November.

=== Accident and death ===

Patton&#x27;s chief of staff Major General Hobart Gay invited him on a pheasant hunting trip on 9 December 1945 near Speyer, Germany to lift his spirits. He noted derelict cars along the side of the road and said, &quot;How awful war is. Think of the waste.&quot; Moments later, the 1938 Cadillac limousine driven by PFC Horace Woodring collided with an American army truck driven by T/5 Robert L. Thompson. Patton&#x27;s regular driver was Sgt. Francis &quot;Jeep&quot; Sanza, but he had left the Army in November 1945.

Gay and others were only slightly injured, but Patton hit his head on the glass partition that separated the front and back seats. He began bleeding from a gash to the head and complained that he was paralyzed and having trouble breathing. He was taken to a hospital in Heidelberg where he was found to have a compression fracture and dislocation of the cervical third and fourth vertebrae, resulting in a broken neck and cervical spinal cord injury that rendered him paralyzed from the neck down.

Patton spent most of the next 12 days in spinal traction to decrease the pressure on his spine. All non-medical visitors were forbidden except his wife Beatrice, who had flown from the U.S. Patton had been told that he had no chance to ever again ride a horse or resume normal life, and he commented, &quot;This is a hell of a way to die.&quot; He died in his sleep of pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure at about 6:00pm on 21 December 1945 at age 60.

On 24 December, Patton was buried at the Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial in the Hamm district of Luxembourg City, alongside some wartime casualties of the Third Army, in accordance with his request to be buried with his men. He was initially buried in the middle of a plot like every other service member, but the large number of visitors to his grave damaged the cemetery grounds, so his remains were moved to their current location at the front of the grave plots.

== Legacy ==

According to Martin Blumenson:

Patton&#x27;s colorful personality, hard-driving leadership style, and success as a commander produced a mixed and often contradictory image when coupled with his frequent political mis-steps. His great oratory skill is seen as integral to his ability to inspire troops under his command. Historian Terry Brighton concluded that Patton was &quot;arrogant, publicity-seeking and personally flawed, but ... among the greatest generals of the war&quot;. His impact was substantial on armored warfare and leadership, with the U.S. Army adopting many of his aggressive strategies for its training programs following his death. Many military officers claim inspiration from his legacy. The first American tank designed after the war became the M46 Patton.

Several actors have portrayed Patton on screen, most famously George C. Scott in the 1970 film &quot;Patton&quot;, for which he won (and refused) the Academy Award for Best Actor. He reprised the role in 1986 in the made-for-television film &quot;The Last Days of Patton&quot; which tells the story of his last few months. 

Other actors who have portrayed Patton include:
* Stephen McNally in the 1957 episode &quot;The Patton Prayer&quot; of the ABC religion anthology series &quot;Crossroads&quot;
* John Larch in the 1963 film &quot;Miracle of the White Stallions&quot;
* Kirk Douglas in the 1966 film &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot;
* George Kennedy in the 1978 film &quot;Brass Target&quot;
* Darren McGavin in the 1979 miniseries &quot;Ike&quot;
* Robert Prentiss in the 1988 film &quot;Pancho Barnes&quot;
* Mitchell Ryan in the 1989 film &quot;Double Exposure: The Story of Margaret Bourke-White&quot;
* Lawrence Dobkin in a 1989 episode of the miniseries &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;
* Edward Asner in the 1997 film &quot;The Long Way Home&quot;
* Gerald McRaney in the 2004 miniseries &quot;&quot;
* Dan Higgins in a 2006 episode of the miniseries &quot;Man, Moment, Machine&quot;
* Kelsey Grammer in the 2008 film &quot;An American Carol&quot;
* Ed Harris in &quot;Resistance&quot; (2020).

=== Image ===

Patton cultivated a flashy, distinctive image in the belief that it would inspire his troops. He carried an ivory-gripped, engraved, silver-plated Colt Single Action Army .45 caliber revolver on his right hip, and frequently wore an ivory-gripped Smith &amp; Wesson Model 27 .357 Magnum on his left hip. He was usually seen wearing a highly polished helmet, riding pants, and high cavalry boots. Patton also cultivated a stern expression he called his &quot;war face&quot;. He was known to oversee training maneuvers from atop a tank painted red, white, and blue. His jeep bore oversized rank placards on the front and back, as well as a klaxon horn which would loudly announce his approach from afar. He proposed a new uniform for the emerging Tank Corps featuring polished buttons, a gold helmet, and thick, dark padded suits; the proposal was derided in the media as &quot;the Green Hornet&quot;, and it was rejected by the Army.

Historian Alan Axelrod wrote that &quot;for Patton, leadership was never simply about making plans and giving orders, it was about transforming oneself into a symbol&quot;. Patton intentionally expressed a conspicuous desire for glory, atypical of the officer corps of the day which emphasized blending in with troops on the battlefield. He was an admirer of Admiral Horatio Nelson for his actions in leading the Battle of Trafalgar in a full-dress uniform. Patton had a preoccupation with bravery, wearing his rank insignia conspicuously in combat, and at one point during World War II he rode atop a tank into a German-controlled village seeking to inspire courage in his men.

Patton was a staunch fatalist, and he believed in reincarnation. He believed that he might have been a military leader killed in action in Napoleon&#x27;s army or a Roman legionary in a previous life.

Patton developed an ability to deliver charismatic speeches. He used profanity heavily in his speech, which generally was enjoyed by troops under his command, but it offended other generals, including Bradley. The most famous of his speeches were a series that he delivered to the Third Army prior to Operation Overlord. He was known for his bluntness and witticism; he once said, &quot;The two most dangerous weapons the Germans have are our own armored halftrack and jeep. The halftrack because the boys in it go all heroic, thinking they are in a tank. The jeep because we have so many God-awful drivers.&quot; During the Battle of the Bulge, he famously remarked that the Allies should &quot;let the sons-of-bitches [Germans] go all the way to Paris, then we&#x27;ll cut them off and round them up.&quot; He also suggested facetiously that his Third Army could &quot;drive the British back into the sea for another Dunkirk.&quot;

As media scrutiny increased on Patton, his bluntness stirred controversy. These began in North Africa when some reporters worried that he was becoming too close to former Vichy officials with Axis sympathies. His public image was more seriously damaged after the slapping incidents. Another controversy occurred prior to Operation Overlord when Patton spoke at a British welcoming club at Knutsford in England: &quot;Since it is the evident destiny of the British and Americans, and of course, the Russians, to rule the world, the better we know each other, the better job we will do.&quot; The next day, news accounts misquoted him by leaving off the Russians.

On a visit home after the war, he again made headlines when he attempted to honor several wounded veterans in a speech by calling them &quot;the real heroes&quot; of the war, unintentionally offending the families of soldiers who had been killed in action. His final media blowup occurred in September 1945 when he said, &quot;Denazification would be like removing all the Republicans and all the Democrats who were in office, who had held office or were quasi-Democrats or Republicans and that would take some time.&quot; This caused Eisenhower to relieve him from command of the Third Army.

As a leader, Patton was known to be highly critical, correcting subordinates mercilessly for the slightest infractions, but also quick to praise their accomplishments. He garnered a reputation as a general who was both impatient and impulsive and had little tolerance for officers who had failed to succeed. However, he fired only General Orlando Ward, and that after two warnings, whereas Bradley sacked several generals during the war. Patton reportedly had the utmost respect for the men serving in his command, particularly the wounded. Many of his directives showed special trouble to care for the enlisted men under his command, and he was well known for arranging extra supplies for battlefield soldiers, including blankets and extra socks, galoshes, and other items normally in short supply at the front.

=== Views on race ===
Patton is known to have held racist attitudes typical for those of his upbringing and family roots in the Confederate South. Privately he wrote of black soldiers:

Individually they were good soldiers, but I expressed my belief at the time, and have never found the necessity of changing it, that a colored soldier cannot think fast enough to fight in armor.

However publicly, Patton stated that performance was more important than race or religious affiliation:

I don&#x27;t give a damn who the man is. He can be a Nigger or a Jew, but if he has the stuff and does his duty, he can have anything I&#x27;ve got. By God! I love him.

Addressing the 761st Tank Battalion Patton also said:

Men, you are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American Army. I would never have asked for you if you weren&#x27;t good. I have nothing but the best in my army. I don&#x27;t care what color you are, so long as you go up there and kill those Kraut sonsabitches! Everyone has their eyes on you and is expecting great things from you. Most of all, your race is looking forward to you. Don&#x27;t let them down and, damn you, don&#x27;t let me down!

Patton called heavily on the Black troops under his command. Historian Hugh Cole noted Patton was the first in the US to integrate black and white soldiers into the same rifle companies.

Additionally, the one man Patton spent the most time with during World War II was his aide and personal valet, Sergeant Major William George Meeks. Meeks was an African American career soldier, and considered a personal confidant by General Patton.

==== Anti-Russian sentiment ====
Patton admired Russia as a political entity, but was disdainful of Russians as a people, saying:

The difficulty in understanding the Russian is that we do not take cognizance of the fact that he is not a European, but an Asiatic, and therefore thinks deviously. We can no more understand a Russian than a Chinaman or a Japanese, and from what I have seen of them, I have no particular desire to understand them, except to ascertain how much lead or iron it takes to kill them. In addition to his other Asiatic characteristics, the Russian has no regard for human life and is an all out son of bitch, barbarian, and chronic drunk.

=== As viewed by Allied leaders ===
On 1 February 1945, Eisenhower wrote a memo ranking the military capabilities of his subordinate American generals in Europe. General Bradley and the Army Air Forces General Carl Spaatz shared the number one position, Walter Bedell Smith was ranked number three, and Patton number four. Eisenhower revealed his reasoning in a 1946 review of the book &quot;Patton and His Third Army&quot;: &quot;George Patton was the most brilliant commander of an Army in the open field that our or any other service produced. But his army was part of a whole organization and his operations part of a great campaign.&quot; Eisenhower believed that other generals should be given the credit for planning the successful Allied campaigns across Europe in which Patton was merely &quot;a brilliant executor&quot;.

Eisenhower&#x27;s overall view of Patton&#x27;s military value is revealed in his refusal to even consider sending him home after the slapping incidents of 1943, after which he privately remarked, &quot;Patton is indispensable to the war effort—one of the guarantors of our victory.&quot; Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy told Eisenhower: &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s remark after they got after Grant comes to mind when I think of Patton—&#x27;I can&#x27;t spare this man, he fights&#x27;.&quot; After Patton&#x27;s death, Eisenhower wrote:

He was one of those men born to be a soldier, an ideal combat leader ... It is no exaggeration to say that Patton&#x27;s name struck terror at the hearts of the enemy.

Historian Carlo D&#x27;Este insisted that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally, but Bradley&#x27;s biographer Jim DeFelice noted that the evidence indicated otherwise. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appeared to greatly esteem Patton and his abilities, stating &quot;he is our greatest fighting general, and sheer joy&quot;. On the other hand, Roosevelt&#x27;s successor Harry S. Truman appears to have taken an instant dislike to Patton, at one point comparing both him and Douglas MacArthur to George Armstrong Custer.

For the most part, British commanders did not hold Patton in high regard. General Alan Brooke noted in January 1943:

I had heard of him, but I must confess that his swashbuckling personality exceeded my expectation. I did not form any high opinion of him, nor had I any reason to alter this view at any later date. A dashing, courageous, wild, and unbalanced leader, good for operations requiring thrust and push, but at a loss in any operation requiring skill and judgment.

One exception was Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery who admired Patton&#x27;s ability to command troops in the field, if not his strategic judgment. Other Allied commanders were more impressed, the Free French in particular. General Henri Giraud was incredulous when he heard of Patton&#x27;s dismissal by Eisenhower in late 1945 and invited him to Paris to be decorated by French President Charles de Gaulle at a state banquet. At the banquet, President de Gaulle gave a speech placing Patton&#x27;s achievements alongside those of Napoleon. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin stated that the Red Army could neither have planned nor executed Patton&#x27;s rapid armored advance across France.

=== As viewed by Axis leaders ===
Allied leaders expressed mixed feelings on Patton&#x27;s capabilities, but the German High Command was noted to have more respect for him than for any other Allied commander after 1943. Adolf Hitler reportedly called him &quot;that crazy cowboy general&quot;. Many German field commanders were generous in their praise of Patton&#x27;s leadership following the war, and many of its highest commanders also held his abilities in high regard. Erwin Rommel credited Patton with executing &quot;the most astonishing achievement in mobile warfare&quot;. &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Alfred Jodl stated that Patton &quot;was the American Guderian. He was very bold and preferred large movements. He took big risks and won big successes.&quot; &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Albert Kesselring said:

Patton had developed tank warfare into an art, and understood how to handle tanks brilliantly in the field. I feel compelled, therefore, to compare him with &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Rommel, who likewise had mastered the art of tank warfare. Both of them had a kind of second sight in regard to this type of warfare.

Fritz Bayerlein said, &quot;I do not think that General Patton would let us get away so easily,&quot; referring to the escape of the Afrika Korps after the Battle of El Alamein. Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt told &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; after his capture, &quot;He is your best.&quot;

<text>John Herbert Dillinger (; June 22, 1903 – July 22, 1934) was an American gangster during the Great Depression. He commanded the Dillinger Gang, which was accused of robbing twenty-four banks and four police stations. Dillinger was imprisoned several times and escaped twice. He was charged with but not convicted of the murder of an East Chicago, Indiana, police officer, who shot Dillinger in his bullet-proof vest during a shootout; it was the only time Dillinger was charged with homicide.

Dillinger courted publicity. The media printed exaggerated accounts of his bravado and colorful personality, and described him as a Robin Hood-type figure. In response, J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Bureau of Investigation (BOI), used Dillinger as justification to evolve the BOI into the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), developing more sophisticated investigative techniques as weapons against organized crime.

After evading police in four states for almost a year, Dillinger was wounded in a gunfight and went to his father&#x27;s home to recover. He returned to Chicago in July 1934 and sought refuge in a brothel owned by Ana Cumpănaș, who later informed authorities of his whereabouts. On July 22, 1934, local and federal law-enforcement officers closed in on the Biograph Theater. When BOI agents moved to arrest Dillinger as he left the theater, he attempted to flee but was fatally shot; the lethal use of force by the agents would eventually be ruled justifiable homicide.

==Early life==
===Family and background===
John Dillinger was born on June 22, 1903, at 2053 Cooper Street, Indianapolis, Indiana, the younger of two children born to John Wilson Dillinger (1864–1943) and Mary Ellen &quot;Mollie&quot; Lancaster (1870–1907).

Dillinger&#x27;s parents had married on August 23, 1887. His father was a grocer by trade and, reportedly, a harsh man. In an interview with reporters, Dillinger said that his father was firm in his discipline and believed in the adage &quot;spare the rod and spoil the child&quot;. His mother died in 1907, just before his fourth birthday.
That same year, Dillinger&#x27;s older sister Audrey married Emmett &quot;Fred&quot; Hancock, in a marriage that produced seven children. She cared for her brother for several years until their father remarried in 1912 to Elizabeth &quot;Lizzie&quot; Fields (1878–1933); they had three children.

===Formative years and marriage===
As a teenager, Dillinger was frequently in trouble for fighting and petty theft; he was also noted for his &quot;bewildering personality&quot; and bullying of smaller children. He quit school to work in an Indianapolis machine shop. Fearing that the city was corrupting his son, Dillinger&#x27;s father relocated the family to Mooresville, Indiana, in 1921. Despite his new rural life, however, Dillinger&#x27;s wild and rebellious behavior was unchanged. In 1922 he was arrested for auto theft, and his relationship with his father deteriorated.

In 1923, Dillinger&#x27;s troubles resulted in him enlisting in the United States Navy, where he was a petty officer third class machinery repairman assigned aboard the battleship . He deserted when his ship was docked in Boston a few months into his service, and was eventually dishonorably discharged.

Dillinger returned to Mooresville, where he met Beryl Ethel Hovious. The two married on April 12, 1924. Despite Dillinger&#x27;s attempts to settle down, he found it difficult finding a job. He subsequently began planning a robbery with his friend, ex-convict Ed Singleton. 

Dillinger and Singleton robbed a Mooresville grocery store, stealing $50 (about $917 in 2024). During the robbery, Dillinger struck a victim on the head with a machine bolt wrapped in a cloth and carried a gun which, although it discharged, hit no one. While leaving the scene, the criminals were seen by a minister who recognized the two men and reported them to the police. They were arrested the next day. Singleton pleaded not guilty, but after Dillinger&#x27;s father (the local Mooresville deacon) discussed the matter with Morgan County prosecutor Omar O&#x27;Harrow, his father convinced Dillinger to confess to the crime and plead guilty without retaining a defense attorney.

Dillinger was convicted of assault and battery with intent to rob, and conspiracy to commit a felony. He expected a lenient sentence of probation as a result of his father&#x27;s discussion with O&#x27;Harrow but was sentenced instead to ten to twenty years in prison. Dillinger&#x27;s father told reporters he regretted his advice and was appalled by the sentence, pleading with the judge to shorten the sentence without success. En route to Mooresville to testify against Singleton, Dillinger briefly escaped his captors but was apprehended within a few minutes. Singleton had a change of venue and was sentenced to a jail term of two to fourteen years. He was killed on September 2, 1937, when he fell asleep on railroad tracks while drunk.

==Prison time==

Incarcerated at Indiana Reformatory and Indiana State Prison between 1924 and 1933, Dillinger developed a criminal lifestyle. Upon being admitted to prison, he was quoted as saying, &quot;I will be the meanest bastard you ever saw when I get out of here.&quot; His physical examination at the prison showed that he had gonorrhea, treatment of which at the time was painful. He became resentful against society because of his long prison sentence and befriended other criminals, including seasoned bank robbers Harry &quot;Pete&quot; Pierpont, Charles Makley, Russell Clark and Homer Van Meter, who taught Dillinger how to be a successful criminal. The men planned heists that they would commit soon after they were released. Dillinger also studied Herman Lamm&#x27;s meticulous bank-robbing system and used it extensively throughout his criminal career.

Dillinger&#x27;s father began a public campaign to have him released and was able to obtain 188 signatures on a petition. On May 10, 1933, after serving nine and a half years, Dillinger was paroled. Released at the height of the Great Depression, Dillinger, with little prospect of finding employment, immediately returned to crime.

On June 21, 1933, Dillinger committed his first bank robbery, stealing $10,000 ($241,000 in 2024) from a bank in New Carlisle, Ohio. On August 14 he robbed a bank in Bluffton, Ohio. Tracked by police from Dayton, he was captured and later transferred to Allen County jail in Lima to be indicted in connection to the Bluffton robbery. After searching him before putting him into the prison, the police discovered a document which appeared to be a prison escape plan. They demanded Dillinger tell them what the document meant, but he refused.

Earlier, Dillinger had helped conceive a plan to enable the escape of Pierpont, Clark and six other prison acquaintances. He had friends smuggle guns into their cells, which they used to escape four days after Dillinger&#x27;s capture. The group that formed up, known as &quot;the First Dillinger Gang,” consisted of Pierpont, Clark, Makley, Ed Shouse, Harry Copeland and John &quot;Red&quot; Hamilton, a member of the Herman Lamm Gang. Pierpont, Clark and Makley arrived in Lima on October 12, 1933, where they impersonated Indiana State Police officers, claiming they had come to extradite Dillinger to Indiana. When the sheriff, Jess Sarber, asked for their credentials, Pierpont shot Sarber dead, then released Dillinger from his house. The four men escaped back to Indiana, where they joined the rest of the gang.

==Bank robberies ==

Dillinger is known to have participated with the Dillinger Gang in twelve separate bank robberies, between June 21, 1933, and June 30, 1934.

==Evelyn Frechette==

Evelyn &quot;Billie&quot; Frechette met Dillinger in October 1933, and they began a relationship the following month. After Dillinger&#x27;s death, Billie was offered money for her story and wrote a memoir for the &quot;Chicago Herald and Examiner&quot; in August 1934.

==Escape from Crown Point, Indiana==

On January 25, 1934, Dillinger and his gang were captured in Tucson, Arizona. Dillinger was extradited to Indiana and escorted back by Matt Leach, the Chief of the Indiana State Police. He was taken to Lake County jail in Crown Point, Indiana, and jailed for charges for the murder of a policeman who was killed during a Dillinger gang bank robbery in East Chicago on January 15, 1934. 

Local police boasted to area newspapers that the jail was escape-proof and had posted extra guards as a precaution. However, on Saturday, March 3, 1934, Dillinger was able to escape during morning exercises with fifteen other inmates. Dillinger produced a pistol, catching deputies and guards by surprise, and was able to leave the premises without firing a shot. Almost immediately afterwards conjecture began whether the gun Dillinger displayed was real or not. According to Deputy Ernest Blunk, Dillinger had escaped using a real pistol. FBI files, on the other hand, indicate that Dillinger used a carved fake pistol. Sam Cahoon, a trustee who Dillinger took hostage in the jail, also believed Dillinger had carved the gun, using a razor and some shelving in his cell. In another version, according to an unpublished interview with Dillinger&#x27;s attorney, Louis Piquett, investigator Art O&#x27;Leary claimed to have snuck the gun in himself.

On March 16, Herbert Youngblood, who escaped from Crown Point alongside Dillinger, was shot dead by police in Port Huron, Michigan. Deputy Sheriff Charles Cavanaugh was mortally wounded in the gunfight and later died. Before his death, Youngblood told officers Dillinger was in Port Huron, and officers immediately began a fruitless search for the escaped man. An Indiana newspaper reported that Youngblood later retracted the story and said he did not know where Dillinger was at that time, as he had parted with him soon after their escape.

Dillinger was indicted by a grand jury, and the Bureau of Investigation (a precursor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation) organized a nationwide manhunt for him. Just hours after his escape from Lake County jail, Dillinger reunited with his girlfriend, Billie Frechette.

According to Frechette&#x27;s trial testimony, Dillinger stayed with her for &quot;almost two weeks.&quot; However, the two had actually traveled to the Twin Cities and taken lodgings at the Santa Monica Apartments in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where they stayed for fifteen days. Dillinger then met Hamilton, and the two mustered a new gang consisting of Baby Face Nelson&#x27;s gang, including Nelson, Homer Van Meter, Tommy Carroll and Eddie Green.

Three days after Dillinger&#x27;s escape from Crown Point, the second Gang robbed a bank in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. A week later they robbed First National Bank in Mason City, Iowa.

==Lincoln Court Apartments shootout==
===Setting===
On Tuesday, March 20, 1934, Dillinger and Frechette relocated into the Lincoln Court Apartments in St. Paul, Minnesota, using the aliases &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Carl T. Hellman&quot; in Apartment 303. Daisy Coffey, the landlord, testified at Frechette&#x27;s trial that she spent most evenings during Dillinger&#x27;s stay observing what was happening. On March 30, Coffey went to the FBI&#x27;s St. Paul field office to file a report, including information about the couple&#x27;s new Hudson sedan parked in the garage behind the apartments.

===Surveillance===
As a result of Coffey&#x27;s tip, the building was surveilled by two agents, Rufus Coulter and Rusty Nalls, but they saw nothing unusual because the blinds were drawn. The next morning, at approximately 10:15 a.m., Nalls circled around the block looking for the Hudson but observed nothing. He parked, first on Lincoln Avenue (the north side of the apartments), then on the west side of Lexington Avenue, at the northwest corner of Lexington and Lincoln, and remained in his car while watching Coulter and St. Paul Police detective Henry Cummings pull up, park and enter the building. Ten minutes later, by Nalls&#x27;s estimate, Van Meter parked a green Ford coupe on the north side of the apartment building.

===Shootout===
Meanwhile, Coulter and Cummings knocked on the door of Apartment 303. Frechette answered, opening the door two to three inches. She said she was not dressed and to come back. Coulter told her they would wait. After waiting two to three minutes, Coulter went to the basement apartment of the caretakers, Louis and Margaret Meidlinger, and asked to use the telephone to call the Bureau. He quickly returned to Cummings, and the two of them waited for Frechette to open the door. Van Meter then appeared in the hall and asked Coulter if his name was Johnson. Coulter said it was not, and as Van Meter passed on to the landing of the third floor, Coulter asked him for a name. Van Meter replied, &quot;I am a soap salesman.&quot; Asked where his samples were, Van Meter said they were in his car. Coulter asked if he had any credentials. Van Meter said &quot;no,&quot; and continued down the stairs. Coulter waited ten to twenty seconds, then followed Van Meter. As Coulter reached the lobby on the ground floor, Van Meter began shooting at him. Coulter hastily fled outside, chased by Van Meter. Van Meter ran back into the front entrance.

Recognizing Van Meter, Nalls pointed out the Ford to Coulter and told him to disable it. Coulter shot out the rear left tire. While Coulter stayed with Van Meter&#x27;s Ford, Nalls went to the corner drugstore and telephoned the local police, then the Bureau&#x27;s St. Paul office, but could not get through because both lines were busy. Van Meter, meanwhile, escaped by hopping on a passing coal truck.

Frechette, in her harboring trial testimony, said that she told Dillinger that the police had shown up after speaking to Cummings. Upon hearing Van Meter firing at Coulter, Dillinger began shooting through the door with a Thompson submachine gun, sending Cummings scrambling for cover. Dillinger then stepped out and fired another burst at Cummings. Cummings shot back with a revolver, but quickly ran out of ammunition. He hit Dillinger in the left calf with one of his five shots. He then hastily retreated down the stairs to the front entrance. Once Cummings retreated, Dillinger and Frechette hurried down the stairs, exited through the back door and drove away in the Hudson.

===Aftermath===
After the shootout, Dillinger and Frechette drove to Eddie Green&#x27;s apartment in Minneapolis. Green telephoned his associate Dr. Clayton E. May at his office at 712 Masonic Temple in downtown Minneapolis (still extant). With Green, his wife Beth and Frechette following in Green&#x27;s car, the doctor drove Dillinger to an apartment belonging to Augusta Salt, who had been providing nursing services and a bed for May&#x27;s illicit patients, whom he could not risk seeing at his regular office, for several years. May treated Dillinger&#x27;s wound with antiseptics. Green visited Dillinger on Monday, April 2, just hours before Green was mortally wounded by the Bureau in St. Paul. Dillinger convalesced at May&#x27;s until Wednesday, April 4. May was promised $500 for his services but received nothing.

==Return to Mooresville==

After the events in Minneapolis, Dillinger and Frechette traveled to Mooresville to visit Dillinger&#x27;s father. Friday, April 6, 1934, was spent contacting family members, particularly his half-brother Hubert Dillinger. On April 6, Hubert and Dillinger left Mooresville at about 8:00 p.m. and proceeded to Leipsic, Ohio (approximately 210 miles away), to see Joseph and Lena Pierpont, parents of Prohibition Era gangster, Harry Pierpont. The Pierponts were not home, so the two headed back to Mooresville around midnight.

On April 7 at approximately 3:30 a.m., they rammed a car driven by Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Manning near Noblesville, Indiana, after Hubert fell asleep behind the wheel. They crashed through a farm fence and about 200 feet into the woods. Both men made it back to the Mooresville farm. Swarms of police showed up at the accident scene within hours. Found in the car were maps, a machine gun magazine, a length of rope, and a bullwhip. According to Hubert, his brother planned to pay a visit with the bullwhip to his former one-armed &quot;shyster&quot; lawyer at Crown Point, Joseph Ryan, who had run off with his retainer after being replaced by Louis Piquett. At about 10:30 a.m. on April 7, Billie, Hubert and Hubert&#x27;s wife purchased a black four-door Ford V8, registering it in the name of Mrs. Fred Penfield (Billie Frechette). At 2:30 p.m., Billie and Hubert picked up the V8 and returned to Mooresville.

On Sunday, April 8, the Dillingers enjoyed a family picnic while the FBI had the farm under surveillance nearby. Later in the afternoon, suspecting they were being watched (agents J. L. Geraghty and T. J. Donegan were cruising in the vicinity in their car), the group left in separate cars. Billie drove the new Ford V8, with two of Dillinger&#x27;s nieces, Mary Hancock in the front seat and Alberta Hancock in the back. Dillinger was on the floor of the car. He was later seen, but not recognized, by Donegan and Geraghty. Eventually, Norman, driving the V8, proceeded with Dillinger and Billie to Chicago, where they separated from Norman.

The next afternoon, Monday, April 9, Dillinger had an appointment at a tavern at 416 North State Street. Sensing trouble, Billie went in first. She was promptly arrested by agents, but refused to reveal Dillinger&#x27;s whereabouts. Dillinger was waiting in his car outside the tavern and then drove off unnoticed. The two never saw each other again.

Dillinger reportedly became despondent after Billie was arrested. The other gang members tried to talk him out of rescuing her, but Van Meter encouraged him by saying that he knew where they could find bulletproof vests. That Friday morning, late at night, Dillinger and Van Meter took a hostage, Warsaw, Indiana police officer Judd Pittenger. They marched Pittenger at gunpoint into the police station, where they stole several more guns and bulletproof vests. After separating, Dillinger picked up Hamilton, who was recovering from the Mason City robbery. The two then traveled to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where they visited Hamilton&#x27;s sister Anna Steve.

== Escape at Little Bohemia ==
The Bureau received a telephone call Sunday morning, April 22 that John Dillinger and several of his confederates were hiding out at a small vacation lodge called Little Bohemia near present-day Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin.

Dillinger and some of the gang were upstairs in the lodge and began shooting out the windows. While the BOI agents ducked for cover, Dillinger and his men fled from the back of the building.

== Hiding in Chicago ==
By July 1934, Dillinger had absconded, and the federal agents did not have any information about his whereabouts. He had, in fact, gone to Chicago where he used the alias of Jimmy Lawrence, a petty criminal from Wisconsin who bore a close resemblance to Dillinger. Working as a clerk, Dillinger found that, in a large metropolis like Chicago, he was able to live an anonymous existence for a while. What he did not realize was that the federal agents&#x27; dragnet happened to be based at Chicago. When the authorities found Dillinger&#x27;s blood-spattered getaway car on a Chicago side street, they were positive that he was in the city.

==Plastic surgery==

According to Art O&#x27;Leary, as early as March 1934, Dillinger expressed an interest in plastic surgery and had asked O&#x27;Leary to check with Piquett on such matters. At the end of April, Piquett paid a visit to his old friend Dr. Wilhelm Loeser. Loeser had practiced in Chicago for 27 years before being convicted under the &quot;Harrison Narcotic Act&quot; in 1931. He was sentenced to three years at Leavenworth, but was paroled early on December 7, 1932, with Piquett&#x27;s help. He later testified that he performed facial surgery on himself and obliterated the fingerprint impressions on the tips of his fingers by the application of a caustic soda preparation. Piquett said Dillinger would have to pay $5,000 for the plastic surgery: $4,400 split between Piquett, Loeser and O&#x27;Leary, and $600 to Dr. Harold Cassidy, who would administer the anaesthetic. The procedure would be done at the home of Piquett&#x27;s longtime friend, 67-year-old James Probasco, at the end of May.

On May 28, Loeser was picked up at his home at 7:30 p.m. by O&#x27;Leary and Cassidy. The three of them then drove to Probasco&#x27;s place. Dillinger chose to have a general anaesthetic. Loeser later testified:
I asked him what work he wanted done. He wanted two warts (moles) removed on the right lower forehead between the eyes and one at the left angle, outer angle of the left eye; wanted a depression of the nose filled in; a scar; a large one to the left of the median line of the upper lip excised, wanted his dimples removed and wanted the angle of the mouth drawn up. He didn&#x27;t say anything about the fingers that day to me.
Cassidy administered an overdose of ether, which caused Dillinger to suffocate. He began to turn blue and stopped breathing. Loeser pulled Dillinger&#x27;s tongue out of his mouth with a pair of forceps, and at the same time forced both elbows into his ribs. Dillinger gasped and resumed breathing. The procedure continued with only a local anesthetic. Loeser removed several moles on Dillinger&#x27;s forehead, made an incision in his nose and an incision in his chin and tied back both cheeks.

Loeser met with Piquett again on Saturday, June 2, with Piquett saying that more work was needed on Dillinger and that Van Meter now wanted the same work done to him. Also, both now wanted work done on their fingertips. The price for the fingerprint procedure would be $500 per hand or $100 a finger. Loeser used a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid—- known commonly as aqua regia.

Loeser met O&#x27;Leary the next night at Clark and Wright at 8:30, and they once again drove to Probasco&#x27;s. Present this evening were Dillinger, Van Meter, Probasco, Piquett, Cassidy, and Peggy Doyle, Probasco&#x27;s girlfriend. Loeser testified that he worked for only about 30 minutes before O&#x27;Leary and Piquett left.

Loeser testified:
Cassidy and I worked on Dillinger and Van Meter simultaneously on June 3. While the work was being done, Dillinger and Van Meter changed off. The work that could be done while the patient was sitting up, that patient was in the sitting-room. The work that had to be done while the man was lying down, that patient was on the couch in the bedroom. They were changed back and forth according to the work to be done. The hands were sterilized, made aseptic with antiseptics, thoroughly washed with soap and water and used sterile gauze afterwards to keep them clean. Next, cutting instrument, knife was used to expose the lower skin ... in other words, take off the epidermis and expose the derma, then alternately the acid and the alkaloid was applied as was necessary to produce the desired results.
Minor work was done two nights later, Tuesday, June 5. Loeser made some small corrections first on Van Meter, then Dillinger. Loeser stated:
A man came in before I left, who I found out later was Baby Face Nelson. He came in with a drum of machine gun bullets under his arm, threw them on the bed or the couch in the bedroom, and started to talk to Van Meter. The two then motioned for Dillinger to come over and the three went back into the kitchen.
Peggy Doyle later told agents:
Dillinger and Van Meter resided at Probasco&#x27;s home until the last week of June 1934; that on some occasions they would be away for a day or two, sometimes leaving separately, and on other occasions together; that at this time Van Meter usually parked his car in the rear of Probasco&#x27;s residence outside the back fence; that she gathered that Dillinger was keeping company with a young woman who lived on the north side of Chicago, inasmuch as he would state upon leaving Probasco&#x27;s home that he was going in the direction of Diversey Boulevard; that Van Meter apparently was not acquainted with Dillinger&#x27;s friend, and she heard him warning Dillinger to be careful about striking up acquaintances with girls he knew nothing about; that Dillinger and Van Meter usually kept a machine gun in an open case under the piano in the parlor; that they also kept a shotgun under the parlor table.
O&#x27;Leary stated that Dillinger expressed dissatisfaction with the facial work that Loeser had performed on him. O&#x27;Leary said that, on another occasion, &quot;that Probasco told him, &#x27;the son of a bitch has gone out for one of his walks&#x27;; that he did not know when he would return; that Probasco raved about the craziness of Dillinger, stating that he was always going for walks and was likely to cause the authorities to locate the place where he was staying; that Probasco stated frankly on this occasion that he was afraid to have the man around.&quot;

Agents arrested Loeser at 1127 South Harvey, Oak Park, Illinois, on Tuesday, July 24. O&#x27;Leary returned from a family fishing trip on July 24, the day of Loeser&#x27;s arrest, and had read in the newspapers that the Department of Justice was looking for two doctors and another man in connection with some plastic surgery that had been done on Dillinger. O&#x27;Leary left Chicago immediately, but returned two weeks later, learned that Loeser and others had been arrested, telephoned Piquett, who assured him everything was all right, then left again. He returned from St. Louis on August 25 and was promptly taken into custody.

On Friday, July 27, Probasco fell to his death from the 19th floor of the Bankers&#x27; Building in Chicago while in custody. On Thursday, August 23, Homer Van Meter was shot and killed in a dead-end alley in St. Paul by Tom Brown, former St. Paul police chief, and then-current chief Frank Cullen.

==Polly Hamilton==
Rita &quot;Polly&quot; Hamilton was a teenage runaway from Fargo, North Dakota. She met Ana Ivanova Akalieva (Ana Cumpănaș; a.k.a. Ana Sage) in Gary, Indiana, and worked periodically as a prostitute in Ana&#x27;s brothel until marrying Gary police officer Roy O. Keele in 1929. They divorced in March 1933.

In the summer of 1934, the now 26-year-old Hamilton was a waitress in Chicago at the S&amp;S Sandwich Shop located at 1209½ Wilson Avenue. She had remained friends with Sage and was sharing living space with Sage and Sage&#x27;s 24-year-old son, Steve, at 2858 Clark Street.

Dillinger and Hamilton, a Billie Frechette look-alike, met in June 1934 at the Barrel of Fun night club located at 4541 Wilson Avenue. Dillinger introduced himself as Jimmy Lawrence and said he was a clerk at the Board of Trade. They dated until Dillinger&#x27;s death at the Biograph Theater in July 1934.

==Betrayal==
Division of Investigations chief J. Edgar Hoover created a special task force headquartered in Chicago to locate Dillinger. On July 21, Ana Cumpănaș, a madam from a brothel in Gary, Indiana, also known as &quot;The Woman in Red&quot; contacted the FBI. She was a Romanian immigrant threatened with deportation for &quot;low moral character&quot; and offered agents information on Dillinger in exchange for their help in preventing her deportation. The FBI agreed to her terms, but she was later deported nonetheless. Cumpănaș revealed that Dillinger was spending time with another prostitute, Polly Hamilton, and that she and the couple were going to see a movie together on the next day. She agreed to wear an orange dress, so police could easily identify her. She was unsure which of two theaters they would attend, the Biograph or the Marbro.

On December 15, 1934, pardons were issued by Indiana Governor Harry G. Leslie for the offenses of which Ana Cumpănaș was convicted.

Cumpănaș stated that on Sunday afternoon, July 22, Dillinger asked her whether she wanted to go to the show with them (Polly and him).
She asked him what show was he going to see, and he said he would &#x27;like to see the theater around the corner,&#x27; meaning the Biograph Theater. She stated she was unable to leave the house to inform Purvis or Martin about Dillinger&#x27;s plans to attend the Biograph, but as they were going to have fried chicken for the evening meal, she told Polly she had nothing in which to fry the chicken and was going to the store to get some butter; that while at the store she called Mr. Purvis and informed him of Dillinger&#x27;s plans to attend the Biograph that evening, at the same time obtaining the butter. She then returned to the house so Polly would not be suspicious that she went out to call anyone.

A team of federal agents and officers from police forces from outside of Chicago was formed, along with a very small number of Chicago police officers. Among them was East Chicago Police Department Sergeant Martin Zarkovich, the officer to whom Cumpănaș had acted as a criminal informant. At the time, federal officials felt that the Chicago Police Department was thoroughly corrupt and could not be trusted; Hoover and Purvis also wanted more of the credit. Not wanting to take the risk of another embarrassing escape of Dillinger, the police were divided into two groups. On Sunday, one team was sent to the Marbro Theater on the city&#x27;s west side, while another team surrounded the Biograph Theater at 2433 N. Lincoln Avenue on the north side.

==Shooting at the Biograph Theater and death==


At approximately 8:30 p.m., Sage, Hamilton, and Dillinger were observed entering the Biograph Theater, which was showing the crime drama &quot;Manhattan Melodrama&quot;, featuring Clark Gable, Myrna Loy, and William Powell. During the stakeout, the Biograph&#x27;s manager thought the agents were criminals preparing for a robbery. He called the Chicago police, who dutifully responded and had to be waved off by the federal agents, who told them that they were on a stakeout for an important target.

When the movie ended, Purvis stood by the front door and signaled Dillinger&#x27;s exit by lighting a cigar. Both he and the other agents reported that Dillinger turned his head and looked directly at the agent as he walked by, glanced across the street, then moved ahead of his female companions, reached into his pocket but failed to extract his gun, and ran into a nearby alley. Other accounts stated Dillinger ignored a command to surrender, whipped out his gun, then headed for the alley. Agents already had the alley closed off.

Three men pursued Dillinger into the alley and fired. Clarence Hurt shot twice, Charles Winstead three times, and Herman Hollis once. Dillinger was hit from behind and fell face first to the ground.

Dillinger was struck four times, with two bullets grazing him and one causing a superficial wound to the right side. The fatal bullet entered through the back of his neck, severed the spinal cord, passed into his brain and exited just under the right eye, severing two sets of veins and arteries. An ambulance was summoned, although it was soon apparent Dillinger had died from the gunshot wounds; he was officially pronounced dead at Alexian Brothers Hospital. According to investigators, Dillinger died without saying a word. Winstead was later thought to have fired the fatal shot, and as a consequence received a personal letter of commendation from J. Edgar Hoover.

Two female bystanders, Theresa Paulas and Etta Natalsky, were wounded. Dillinger bumped into Natalsky just as the shooting started. Natalsky was shot and was taken to Columbus Hospital.

Dillinger was shot and killed by the special agents on July 22, 1934, at approximately 10:40 p.m, according to a &quot;New York Times&quot; report the next day. Dillinger&#x27;s death came only two months after the deaths of fellow notorious criminals Bonnie and Clyde. There were reports of people dipping their handkerchiefs and skirts into the pool of blood that had formed, as Dillinger lay in the alley, as keepsakes: &quot;Souvenir hunters madly dipped newspapers in the blood that stained the pavement. Handkerchiefs were whipped out and used to mop up the blood.&quot;

==Funeral==
Dillinger&#x27;s body was available for public display at the Cook County morgue. An estimated 15,000 people viewed the corpse over a day and a half. As many as four death masks were also made.

Dillinger is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis. Dillinger&#x27;s gravestone has been replaced several times because of vandalism by people chipping off pieces as souvenirs. Hilton Crouch (1903–1976), an associate of Dillinger&#x27;s on some early heists, is buried only a few yards to the west.

<text>Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement is a 1947 American drama film based on Laura Z. Hobson&#x27;s best-selling 1947 novel of the same title. The film is about a journalist (played by Gregory Peck) who pretends to be Jewish to research an exposé on the widespread antisemitism in New York City and the affluent communities of New Canaan and Darien, Connecticut. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won three: Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress (Celeste Holm), and Best Director (Elia Kazan).

The movie was controversial in its day, as was a similar film on the same subject, &quot;Crossfire&quot;, which was released the same year (though that film was originally a story about anti-homosexuality, later changed to antisemitism).

In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

Widowed journalist Philip Schuyler Green moves to New York City with his aging mother and his young son Tommy. Phil meets with magazine publisher John Minify, who asks Green, a gentile, to write an article on antisemitism. At first, he is not enthusiastic about the story.

At a lunch party, Phil meets Minify&#x27;s niece Kathy Lacey, who is actually the person who suggested the story idea. The next day, at home, Phil admits his surprise after learning that the idea came from &quot;a girl&quot;. His mother mocks him for his anti-female prejudice. Phil then tries to explain anti-Jewish prejudice to his son. Realizing how difficult it is to explain these topics, he decides to write the story.

Phil and Kathy begin dating and Phil adopts a Jewish identity to write the story from a fresh perspective. They agree to keep it secret that Phil is not Jewish. Despite seeming to have liberal views, Kathy is taken aback after learning of Phil&#x27;s plan.

At the magazine, Phil is assigned a secretary, Elaine Wales. She turns out to be Jewish, but changed her name to get the job. After learning of Wales&#x27; experience from Phil, Minify orders the magazine to adopt hiring policies that are open to Jews. Phil meets fashion editor Anne Dettrey, who becomes a good friend and potentially more, particularly as strains develop between Phil and Kathy.

After completing his service in WWII, Dave Goldman, Phil&#x27;s childhood friend, moves to New York and lives with the Greens while searching for a job and a home for his family. Being Jewish, Dave also experiences antisemitism. Housing is scarce in the city, but it is particularly difficult for him, since not all landlords will rent to a Jewish family.

While researching his story, Phil experiences several incidents of bigotry. When Phil&#x27;s mother becomes ill with a heart condition, the doctor discourages him from consulting a specialist with a Jewish name. After hearing Phil is Jewish, the doctor becomes uncomfortable and leaves.

In addition, the janitor is shocked to see that a Jewish name is listed on the mail box. Furthermore, when Phil wants to celebrate his honeymoon at a swanky hotel, the manager refuses to register Phil, whom he tells to go elsewhere.

Tommy also becomes the target of bullies because of this. Phil is troubled by the way Kathy consoles Tommy, telling him their taunts of &quot;dirty Jew&quot; are wrong because he is not Jewish, not that the epithet is wrong in and of itself.

Kathy&#x27;s attitudes are revealed further when she and Phil announce their engagement. Her sister Jane invites them to a celebration in her home in Darien, which is known to be a community where Jews are not welcome. Fearing an awkward scene, Kathy wants to tell her family and friends that Phil only pretends to be Jewish, but he dissuades her. At the party, everyone is friendly to Phil, though many people cancel at the last minute.

Dave announces he will have to quit his job because he cannot find a residence for his family. Kathy owns a vacant cottage in Darien and Phil sees it as a solution to Dave&#x27;s problem. Kathy, however, is unwilling to offend her neighbors by renting it to a Jewish family. Phil breaks his engagement to her and announces he will be moving away from New York when his article is published. When it comes out, it is well received by the magazine staff.

Kathy meets with Dave and tells him how sick she felt when a party guest told a bigoted joke. However, she has no answer when Dave asks her what she did about it. She realizes that remaining silent condones the prejudice.

The next day, Dave announces that he and his family will be moving into the cottage in Darien and Kathy will be moving in with her sister next door to make sure they are treated well. Moved by this, Phil reconciles with Kathy. His mother, still recovering from her heart condition, tells Phil that his article has given her new hope for the future, a new motivation to get well.

Zanuck decided to make a film version of Hobson&#x27;s novel after being refused membership in the Los Angeles Country Club, because it was assumed (incorrectly) that he was Jewish. Before filming commenced, Samuel Goldwyn and other Jewish film executives approached Darryl Zanuck and asked him not to make the film, fearing it would &quot;stir up trouble&quot;. They also warned that Hays Code enforcer Joseph Breen might not allow the film to pass the censors, as he had been known to make disparaging remarks about Jews. There was also concern that Dorothy McGuire&#x27;s character being divorced would offend the National Legion of Decency.

The role of Phillip Green was first offered to Cary Grant, but he turned it down. Peck decided to accept the role, although his agent advised him to refuse, believing Peck would be endangering his career. Jewish actor John Garfield agreed to play a lesser role in the film to be a part of it.

Portions of the film were shot on location in Darien, Connecticut.

==Reception and box-office==
&quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; received a generally favorable reception from influential &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Bosley Crowther. Crowther said that &quot;every point about prejudice which Miss Hobson had to make in her book has been made with superior illustration and more graphic demonstration in the film, so that the sweep of her moral indignation is not only widened, but intensified thereby&quot;. However, Crowther also said that the movie shared the novel&#x27;s failings in that &quot;explorations are narrowly confined to the upper-class social and professional level to which he is immediately exposed&quot;. He also said the main character&#x27;s shock at the extent of anti-Semitism was lacking in credibility: &quot;It is, in a careful analysis, an extraordinarily naive role.&quot;

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an aggregate score of 82% based on 83 critic reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;It occasionally fails to live up to its subject matter – and is perhaps an &#x27;important&#x27; film more than a &#x27;great&#x27; one – but the performances from Gregory Peck and Dorothy McGuire are superb.&quot;

&quot;The New York Herald Tribune&quot; described it as a &quot;brilliant blow against racial and religious intolerance&quot;. &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; assessed it as &quot;the most explosive picture of the year&quot; and &quot;one of the most exciting and punch-laden pictures you&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

In addition to winning Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actress (Celeste Holm), &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; was one of Fox&#x27;s highest-grossing movies of 1947. The political nature of the film, however, upset the House Un-American Activities Committee, with Elia Kazan, John Garfield, and Anne Revere all being called to testify before the committee. Revere refused to testify and although Garfield appeared, he refused to &quot;name names&quot;. Both were placed in the &quot;Red Channels&quot; of the Hollywood Blacklist. Garfield remained on the blacklist for a year, was called again to testify against his wife, and died of a heart attack at the age of 39 before his second hearing date.

In recognition for producing &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot;, the Hollywood chapter of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith International honored Darryl Zanuck as its &quot;Man of the Year&quot; for 1948. On Sunday, December 12, a gala commemoration evening was held in downtown Los Angeles at the Biltmore Hotel before a crowd of over a thousand. Among the tributes to Zanuck, New Mexico Senator Clinton Anderson said, &quot;He does not storm up and down the streets of a community, urging its citizens to do good. He does not fill the pages of books with words that string together into a sermon. He allows you to be seated comfortably in a theater, to be absorbed in a problem and to walk out into the night with your thoughts clarified and your lips saying, &#x27;This situation ought to be changed&#x27;.&quot; After the formal speeches there was a star-studded variety show, including the debut before the Hollywood film world of the team of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.

The movie was an unexpected hit at the box office. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, it earned $3.9 million in rentals in the US in 1948.

Leonard Maltin said &quot;sincere...then-daring approach to the subject matter is tame now.&quot;
