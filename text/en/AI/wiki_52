<text>In telecommunications, signaling is the use of signals for controlling communications. This may constitute an information exchange concerning the establishment and control of a telecommunication circuit and the management of the network.

==Classification==
Signaling systems may be classified based on several principal characteristics.

===In-band and out-of-band signaling===
In the public switched telephone network (PSTN), in-band signaling is the exchange of call control information within the same physical channel, or within the same frequency band, that the message (the callers&#x27; voice) is using. An example is dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF), which is used on most telephone lines to customer premises.

Out-of-band signaling is telecommunication signaling on a dedicated channel separate from that used for the message. Out-of-band signaling has been used since Signaling System No. 6 (SS6) was introduced in the 1970s, and also in Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) in 1980 which became the standard for signaling among exchanges internationally.

In the mid-20th century, supervision signals on long-distance trunks in North America were primarily in-band, for example at 2600 Hz, necessitating a notch filter to prevent interference. Late in the century, all supervisory signals had been moved out of band. With the advent of digital trunks, supervision signals are carried by robbed bits or other bits in the E1-carrier dedicated to signaling.

===Line versus register signaling===
Line signaling is concerned with conveying information on the state of the line or channel, such as on-hook, off-hook (answer supervision and disconnect supervision, together referred to as &quot;supervision&quot;), ringing, and hook flash. 
Register signaling is concerned with conveying addressing information, such as the calling and/or called telephone number. In the early days of telephony, with operator handling calls, the addressing formation is by voice as &quot;Operator, connect me to Mr. Smith please&quot;. In the first half of the 20th century, addressing formation is done by using a rotary dial, which rapidly breaks the line current into pulses, with the number of pulses conveying the address. Finally, starting in the second half of the century, address signaling is by DTMF.

===Channel-associated versus common-channel signaling===
Channel-associated signaling (CAS) employs a signaling channel that is dedicated to a specific bearer channel.

Common-channel signaling (CCS) employs a signaling channel which conveys signaling information relating to multiple bearer channels. These bearer channels, therefore, have their signaling channel in common.

===Compelled signaling===
Compelled signaling refers to signaling where the receipt of each signal from an originating register needs to be explicitly acknowledged before the next signal can be sent.

Most forms of R2 register signaling are compelled, while R1 multi-frequency signaling is not.

The term is only relevant in the case of signaling systems that use discrete signals (e.g. a combination of tones to denote one digit), as opposed to signaling systems which are message-oriented (such as SS7 and ISDN Q.931) where each message is able to convey multiple items of formation (e.g. multiple digits of the called telephone number).

===Subscriber versus trunk signaling===
Subscriber signaling refers to the signaling between the telephone and the telephone exchange. Trunk signaling is the signaling between exchanges.

==Examples==
Every signaling system can be characterized along each of the above axes of classification. A few examples:
*DTMF is an in-band, channel-associated register signaling system. It is not compelled.
*SS7 (e.g., TUP or ISUP) is an out-of-band, common-channel signaling system that incorporates both line and register signaling.
*Metering pulses (depending on the country, these are 50 Hz, 12 kHz or 16 kHz pulses sent by the exchange to payphones or metering boxes) are out-of-band (because they do not fall within the frequency range used by the telephony signal, which is 300 through 3400 Hz) and channel-associated. They are generally regarded as line signaling, although this is open to debate.
*E and M signaling (E&amp;M) is an out-of-band channel-associated signaling system. The base system is intended for line signaling, but if decadic pulses are used it can also convey register information. E&amp;M line signaling is however usually paired with DTMF register signaling.
*By contrast, the L1 signaling system (which typically employs a 2280 Hz tone of various durations) is an in-band channel-associated signaling system as was the SF 2600 hertz system formerly used in the Bell System.
*Loop start, ground start, reverse battery and revertive pulse systems are all DC, thus out of band, and all are channel-associated since the DC currents are on the talking wires.

Whereas common-channel signaling systems are out-of-band by definition, and in-band signaling systems are also necessarily channel-associated, the above metering pulse example demonstrates that there exist channel-associated signaling systems which are out-of-band.

==Protocols==
A signaling protocol is a type of communications protocol for encapsulating the signaling between communication endpoints and switching systems to establish or terminate a connection and to identify the state of connection.

The following is a list of signaling protocols:
* ALOHA
* Digital Subscriber System No. 1 (EDSS1)

<text>Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR or S/N) is a measure used in science and engineering that compares the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise. SNR is defined as the ratio of signal power to noise power, often expressed in decibels. A ratio higher than 1:1 (greater than 0 dB) indicates more signal than noise.

SNR is an important parameter that affects the performance and quality of systems that process or transmit signals, such as communication systems, audio systems, radar systems, imaging systems, and data acquisition systems. A high SNR means that the signal is clear and easy to detect or interpret, while a low SNR means that the signal is corrupted or obscured by noise and may be difficult to distinguish or recover. SNR can be improved by various methods, such as increasing the signal strength, reducing the noise level, filtering out unwanted noise, or using error correction techniques.

SNR also determines the maximum possible amount of data that can be transmitted reliably over a given channel, which depends on its bandwidth and SNR. This relationship is described by the Shannon–Hartley theorem, which is a fundamental law of information theory.

SNR can be calculated using different formulas depending on how the signal and noise are measured and defined. The most common way to express SNR is in decibels, which is a logarithmic scale that makes it easier to compare large or small values. Other definitions of SNR may use different factors or bases for the logarithm, depending on the context and application.

==Definition==

One definition of signal-to-noise ratio is the ratio of the power of a signal (meaningful input) to the power of background noise (meaningless or unwanted input):
:formula_1
where is average power. Both signal and noise power must be measured at the same or equivalent points in a system, and within the same system bandwidth.

The signal-to-noise ratio of a random variable () to random noise is:

formula_2

where E refers to the expected value, which in this case is the mean square of .

If the signal is simply a constant value of &quot;&quot;, this equation simplifies to:

formula_3

If the noise has expected value of zero, as is common, the denominator is its variance, the square of its standard deviation .

The signal and the noise must be measured the same way, for example as voltages across the same impedance. Their root mean squares can alternatively be used according to:
:formula_4
where is root mean square (RMS) amplitude (for example, RMS voltage).

===Decibels===
Because many signals have a very wide dynamic range, signals are often expressed using the logarithmic decibel scale. Based upon the definition of decibel, signal and noise may be expressed in decibels (dB) as

:formula_5

and

:formula_6

In a similar manner, SNR may be expressed in decibels as

:formula_7

Using the definition of SNR

:formula_8

Using the quotient rule for logarithms

:formula_9

Substituting the definitions of SNR, signal, and noise in decibels into the above equation results in an important formula for calculating the signal to noise ratio in decibels, when the signal and noise are also in decibels:
:formula_10

In the above formula, P is measured in units of power, such as watts (W) or milliwatts (mW), and the signal-to-noise ratio is a pure number.

However, when the signal and noise are measured in volts (V) or amperes (A), which are measures of amplitude, they must first be squared to obtain a quantity proportional to power, as shown below:

:formula_11

===Dynamic range===
The concepts of signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range are closely related. Dynamic range measures the ratio between the strongest un-distorted signal on a channel and the minimum discernible signal, which for most purposes is the noise level. SNR measures the ratio between an arbitrary signal level (not necessarily the most powerful signal possible) and noise. Measuring signal-to-noise ratios requires the selection of a representative or &quot;reference&quot; signal. In audio engineering, the reference signal is usually a sine wave at a standardized nominal or alignment level, such as 1 kHz at +4 dBu (1.228 VRMS).

SNR is usually taken to indicate an &quot;average&quot; signal-to-noise ratio, as it is possible that instantaneous signal-to-noise ratios will be considerably different. The concept can be understood as normalizing the noise level to 1 (0 dB) and measuring how far the signal &#x27;stands out&#x27;.

===Difference from conventional power===
In physics, the average power of an AC signal is defined as the average value of voltage times current; for resistive (non-reactive) circuits, where voltage and current are in phase, this is equivalent to the product of the rms voltage and current:
:formula_12

:formula_13
But in signal processing and communication, one usually assumes that formula_14 so that factor is usually not included while measuring power or energy of a signal. This may cause some confusion among readers, but the resistance factor is not significant for typical operations performed in signal processing, or for computing power ratios. For most cases, the power of a signal would be considered to be simply
:formula_15

== Alternative definition ==
An alternative definition of SNR is as the reciprocal of the coefficient of variation, i.e., the ratio of mean to standard deviation of a signal or measurement:
:formula_16
where formula_17 is the signal mean or expected value and formula_18 is the standard deviation of the noise, or an estimate thereof. Notice that such an alternative definition is only useful for variables that are always non-negative (such as photon counts and luminance), and it is only an approximation since formula_19. It is commonly used in image processing, where the SNR of an image is usually calculated as the ratio of the mean pixel value to the standard deviation of the pixel values over a given neighborhood.

Sometimes SNR is defined as the square of the alternative definition above, in which case it is equivalent to the more common definition:
:formula_20

This definition is closely related to the sensitivity index or &quot;d″&quot;, when assuming that the signal has two states separated by signal amplitude formula_17, and the noise standard deviation formula_18 does not change between the two states.

The &quot;Rose criterion&quot; (named after Albert Rose) states that an SNR of at least 5 is needed to be able to distinguish image features with certainty. An SNR less than 5 means less than 100% certainty in identifying image details.

Yet another alternative, very specific, and distinct definition of SNR is employed to characterize sensitivity of imaging systems; see Signal-to-noise ratio (imaging).

Related measures are the &quot;contrast ratio&quot; and the &quot;contrast-to-noise ratio&quot;.

==Modulation system measurements==

===Amplitude modulation===

Channel signal-to-noise ratio is given by
:formula_23
where W is the bandwidth and formula_24 is modulation index

Output signal-to-noise ratio (of AM receiver) is given by
:formula_25

===Frequency modulation===

Channel signal-to-noise ratio is given by
:formula_26

Output signal-to-noise ratio is given by
:formula_27

==Noise reduction==
All real measurements are disturbed by noise. This includes electronic noise, but can also include external events that affect the measured phenomenon — wind, vibrations, the gravitational attraction of the moon, variations of temperature, variations of humidity, etc., depending on what is measured and of the sensitivity of the device. It is often possible to reduce the noise by controlling the environment.

Internal electronic noise of measurement systems can be reduced through the use of low-noise amplifiers.

When the characteristics of the noise are known and are different from the signal, it is possible to use a filter to reduce the noise. For example, a lock-in amplifier can extract a narrow bandwidth signal from broadband noise a million times stronger.

When the signal is constant or periodic and the noise is random, it is possible to enhance the SNR by averaging the measurements. In this case the noise goes down as the square root of the number of averaged samples.

==Digital signals==
When a measurement is digitized, the number of bits used to represent the measurement determines the maximum possible signal-to-noise ratio. This is because the minimum possible noise level is the error caused by the quantization of the signal, sometimes called quantization noise. This noise level is non-linear and signal-dependent; different calculations exist for different signal models. Quantization noise is modeled as an analog error signal summed with the signal before quantization (&quot;additive noise&quot;).

This theoretical maximum SNR assumes a perfect input signal. If the input signal is already noisy (as is usually the case), the signal&#x27;s noise may be larger than the quantization noise. Real analog-to-digital converters also have other sources of noise that further decrease the SNR compared to the theoretical maximum from the idealized quantization noise, including the intentional addition of dither.

Although noise levels in a digital system can be expressed using SNR, it is more common to use Eb/No, the energy per bit per noise power spectral density.

The modulation error ratio (MER) is a measure of the SNR in a digitally modulated signal.

===Fixed point===
For &quot;n&quot;-bit integers with equal distance between quantization levels (uniform quantization) the dynamic range (DR) is also determined.

Assuming a uniform distribution of input signal values, the quantization noise is a uniformly distributed random signal with a peak-to-peak amplitude of one quantization level, making the amplitude ratio 2&quot;n&quot;/1. The formula is then:
:formula_28

This relationship is the origin of statements like &quot;16-bit audio has a dynamic range of 96 dB&quot;. Each extra quantization bit increases the dynamic range by roughly 6 dB.

Assuming a full-scale sine wave signal (that is, the quantizer is designed such that it has the same minimum and maximum values as the input signal), the quantization noise approximates a sawtooth wave with peak-to-peak amplitude of one quantization level and uniform distribution. In this case, the SNR is approximately
:formula_29

===Floating point===
Floating-point numbers provide a way to trade off signal-to-noise ratio for an increase in dynamic range. For n-bit floating-point numbers, with n-m bits in the mantissa and m bits in the exponent:
:formula_30

:formula_31

The dynamic range is much larger than fixed-point but at a cost of a worse signal-to-noise ratio. This makes floating-point preferable in situations where the dynamic range is large or unpredictable. Fixed-point&#x27;s simpler implementations can be used with no signal quality disadvantage in systems where dynamic range is less than 6.02m. The very large dynamic range of floating-point can be a disadvantage, since it requires more forethought in designing algorithms.

==Optical signals==
Optical signals have a carrier frequency (about and more) that is much higher than the modulation frequency. This way the noise covers a bandwidth that is much wider than the signal itself. The resulting signal influence relies mainly on the filtering of the noise. To describe the signal quality without taking the receiver into account, the optical SNR (OSNR) is used. The OSNR is the ratio between the signal power and the noise power in a given bandwidth. Most commonly a reference bandwidth of 0.1 nm is used. This bandwidth is independent of the modulation format, the frequency and the receiver. For instance an OSNR of 20 dB/0.1 nm could be given, even the signal of 40 GBit DPSK would not fit in this bandwidth. OSNR is measured with an optical spectrum analyzer.

==Types and abbreviations==
Signal to noise ratio may be abbreviated as SNR and less commonly as S/N. PSNR stands for peak signal-to-noise ratio. GSNR stands for geometric signal-to-noise ratio. SINR is the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio.

==Other uses==
While SNR is commonly quoted for electrical signals, it can be applied to any form of signal, for example isotope levels in an ice core, biochemical signaling between cells, or financial trading signals. The term is sometimes used metaphorically to refer to the ratio of useful information to false or irrelevant data in a conversation or exchange. For example, in online discussion forums and other online communities, off-topic posts and spam are regarded as that interferes with the of appropriate discussion.

SNR can also be applied in marketing and how business professionals manage information overload. Managing a healthy signal to noise ratio can help business executives improve their KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).

== Similar concepts ==
The signal-to-noise ratio is similar to Cohen&#x27;s d given by the difference of estimated means divided by the standard deviation of the data formula_32 and is related to the test statistic formula_33 in the t-test.

<text>Signal transition, when referring to the modulation of a carrier signal, is a change from one significant condition to another. 

Examples of signal transitions are a change from one electric current, voltage, or power level to another; a change from one optical power level to another; a phase shift; or a change from one frequency or wavelength to another. 

Signal transitions are used to create signals that represent information, such as &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; or &quot;mark&quot; and &quot;space&quot;.

<text>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet Standard protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on IP networks and for modifying that information to change device behavior. Devices that typically support SNMP include cable modems, routers, network switches, servers, workstations, printers, and more.

SNMP is widely used in network management for network monitoring. SNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems organized in a management information base (MIB), which describes the system status and configuration. These variables can then be remotely queried (and, in some circumstances, manipulated) by managing applications.

Three significant versions of SNMP have been developed and deployed. SNMPv1 is the original version of the protocol. More recent versions, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3, feature improvements in performance, flexibility and security.

SNMP is a component of the Internet Protocol Suite as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It consists of a set of standards for network management, including an application layer protocol, a database schema, and a set of data objects.

== Overview and basic concepts ==

In typical uses of SNMP, one or more administrative computers called &quot;managers&quot; have the task of monitoring or managing a group of hosts or devices on a computer network. Each managed system executes a software component called an &quot;agent&quot; that reports information via SNMP to the manager.

An SNMP-managed network consists of three key components:
* Managed devices
* Agentsoftware that runs on managed devices
* Network management station (NMS)software that runs on the manager

A &quot;managed device&quot; is a network node that implements an SNMP interface that allows unidirectional (read-only) or bidirectional (read and write) access to node-specific information. Managed devices exchange node-specific information with the NMSs. Sometimes called network elements, the managed devices can be any type of device, including, but not limited to, routers, access servers, switches, cable modems, bridges, hubs, IP telephones, IP video cameras, computer hosts, and printers.

An &quot;agent&quot; is a network-management software module that resides on a managed device. An agent has local knowledge of management information and translates that information to or from an SNMP-specific form.

A &quot;network management station&quot; executes applications that monitor and control managed devices. NMSs provide the bulk of the processing and memory resources required for network management. One or more NMSs may exist on any managed network.

== Management information base ==

SNMP agents expose management data on the managed systems as variables. The protocol also permits active management tasks, such as configuration changes, through remote modification of these variables. The variables accessible via SNMP are organized in hierarchies. SNMP itself does not define which variables a managed system should offer. Rather, SNMP uses an extensible design that allows applications to define their own hierarchies. These hierarchies are described as a management information base (MIB). MIBs describe the structure of the management data of a device subsystem; they use a hierarchical namespace containing object identifiers (OID). Each OID identifies a variable that can be read or set via SNMP. MIBs use the notation defined by Structure of Management Information Version 2.0 (SMIv2, ), a subset of ASN.1.

== Protocol details ==
SNMP operates in the application layer of the Internet protocol suite. All SNMP messages are transported via User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The SNMP agent receives requests on UDP port 161. The manager may send requests from any available source port to port 161 in the agent. The agent response is sent back to the source port on the manager. The manager receives notifications (&quot;Traps&quot; and &quot;InformRequests&quot;) on port 162. The agent may generate notifications from any available port. When used with Transport Layer Security or Datagram Transport Layer Security, requests are received on port 10161 and notifications are sent to port 10162.

SNMPv1 specifies five core protocol data units (PDUs). Two other PDUs, &quot;GetBulkRequest&quot; and &quot;InformRequest&quot; were added in SNMPv2 and the &quot;Report&quot; PDU was added in SNMPv3. All SNMP PDUs are constructed as follows:

The seven SNMP PDU types as identified by the &quot;PDU-type&quot; field are as follows:

; GetRequest : A manager-to-agent request to retrieve the value of a variable or list of variables. Desired variables are specified in variable bindings (the value field is not used). Retrieval of the specified variable values is to be done as an atomic operation by the agent. A &quot;Response&quot; with current values is returned.
; SetRequest : A manager-to-agent request to change the value of a variable or list of variables. Variable bindings are specified in the body of the request. Changes to all specified variables are to be made as an atomic operation by the agent. A &quot;Response&quot; with (current) new values for the variables is returned.
; GetNextRequest : A manager-to-agent request to discover available variables and their values. Returns a &quot;Response&quot; with variable binding for the lexicographically next variable in the MIB. The entire MIB of an agent can be walked by iterative application of &quot;GetNextRequest&quot; starting at OID 0. Rows of a table can be read by specifying column OIDs in the variable bindings of the request.
; GetBulkRequest : A manager-to-agent request for multiple iterations of &quot;GetNextRequest&quot;. An optimized version of &quot;GetNextRequest&quot;. Returns a &quot;Response&quot; with multiple variable bindings walked from the variable binding or bindings in the request. PDU specific &quot;non-repeaters&quot; and &quot;max-repetitions&quot; fields are used to control response behavior. &quot;GetBulkRequest&quot; was introduced in SNMPv2.
; Response: Returns variable bindings and acknowledgement from agent to manager for &quot;GetRequest&quot;, &quot;SetRequest&quot;, &quot;GetNextRequest&quot;, &quot;GetBulkRequest&quot; and &quot;InformRequest&quot;. Error reporting is provided by &quot;error-status&quot; and &quot;error-index&quot; fields. Although it was used as a response to both gets and sets, this PDU was called &quot;GetResponse&quot; in SNMPv1.
; : Asynchronous notification from agent to manager. While in other SNMP communication, the manager actively requests information from the agent, these are PDUs that are sent from the agent to the manager without being explicitly requested. SNMP Traps enable an agent to notify the management station of significant events by way of an unsolicited SNMP message. Trap PDUs include current &quot;sysUpTime&quot; value, an OID identifying the type of trap and optional variable bindings. Destination addressing for traps is determined in an application-specific manner typically through trap configuration variables in the MIB. The format of the trap message was changed in SNMPv2 and the PDU was renamed &quot;SNMPv2-Trap&quot;.
; : Acknowledged asynchronous notification. This PDU was introduced in SNMPv2 and was originally defined as &quot;manager to manager&quot; communication. Later implementations have loosened the original definition to allow &quot;agent to manager&quot; communications. Manager-to-manager notifications were already possible in SNMPv1 using a &quot;Trap&quot;, but as SNMP commonly runs over UDP where delivery is not assured and dropped packets are not reported, delivery of a &quot;Trap&quot; was not guaranteed. &quot;InformRequest&quot; fixes this as an acknowledgement is returned on receipt.

 specifies that an SNMP implementation must accept a message of at least 484 bytes in length. In practice, SNMP implementations accept longer messages. If implemented correctly, an SNMP message is discarded if the decoding of the message fails and thus malformed SNMP requests are ignored. A successfully decoded SNMP request is then authenticated using the community string. If the authentication fails, a trap is generated indicating an authentication failure and the message is dropped.

SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c use &quot;communities&quot; to establish trust between managers and agents. Most agents support three community names, one each for read-only, read-write and trap. These three &quot;community strings&quot; control different types of activities. The read-only community applies to &quot;get&quot; requests. The read-write community string applies to &quot;set&quot; requests. The trap community string applies to receipt of &quot;traps&quot;. SNMPv3 also uses community strings, but allows for secure authentication and communication between SNMP manager and agent.

== Protocol versions ==
In practice, SNMP implementations often support multiple versions: typically SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3.

=== Version 1 ===
SNMP version 1 (SNMPv1) is the initial implementation of the SNMP protocol. The design of SNMPv1 was done in the 1980s by a group of collaborators who viewed the officially sponsored OSI/IETF/NSF (National Science Foundation) effort (HEMS/CMIS/CMIP) as both unimplementable in the computing platforms of the time as well as potentially unworkable. SNMP was approved based on a belief that it was an interim protocol needed for taking steps towards large-scale deployment of the Internet and its commercialization.

The first Request for Comments (RFCs) for SNMP, now known as SNMPv1, appeared in 1988:
*  — Structure and identification of management information for TCP/IP-based internets
*  — Management information base for network management of TCP/IP-based internets
*  — A simple network management protocol

In 1990, these documents were superseded by:
*  — Structure and identification of management information for TCP/IP-based internets
*  — Management information base for network management of TCP/IP-based internets
*  — A simple network management protocol

In 1991, (MIB-1) was replaced by the more often used:
*  — Version 2 of management information base (MIB-2) for network management of TCP/IP-based internets

SNMPv1 is widely used and is the de facto network management protocol in the Internet community.

SNMPv1 may be carried by transport layer protocols such as User Datagram Protocol (UDP), OSI Connectionless-mode Network Service (CLNS), AppleTalk Datagram Delivery Protocol (DDP), and Novell Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX).

Version 1 has been criticized for its poor security. The specification does, in fact, allow room for custom authentication to be used, but widely used implementations &quot;support only a trivial authentication service that identifies all SNMP messages as authentic SNMP messages.&quot; The security of the messages, therefore, becomes dependent on the security of the channels over which the messages are sent. For example, an organization may consider their internal network to be sufficiently secure that no encryption is necessary for its SNMP messages. In such cases, the &quot;community name&quot;, which is transmitted in cleartext, tends to be viewed as a de facto password, in spite of the original specification.

=== Version 2 ===
SNMPv2, defined by and , revises version 1 and includes improvements in the areas of performance, security and manager-to-manager communications. It introduced &quot;GetBulkRequest&quot;, an alternative to iterative GetNextRequests for retrieving large amounts of management data in a single request. The new party-based security system introduced in SNMPv2, viewed by many as overly complex, was not widely adopted. This version of SNMP reached the Proposed Standard level of maturity, but was deemed obsolete by later versions.

&quot;Community-Based Simple Network Management Protocol version 2&quot;, or &quot;SNMPv2c&quot;, is defined in –. SNMPv2c comprises SNMPv2 &quot;without&quot; the controversial new SNMP v2 security model, using instead the simple community-based security scheme of SNMPv1. This version is one of relatively few standards to meet the IETF&#x27;s Draft Standard maturity level, and was widely considered the &quot;de facto&quot; SNMPv2 standard. It was later restated as part of SNMPv3.

&quot;User-Based Simple Network Management Protocol version 2&quot;, or &quot;SNMPv2u&quot;, is defined in –. This is a compromise that attempts to offer greater security than SNMPv1, but without incurring the high complexity of SNMPv2. A variant of this was commercialized as &quot;SNMP v2*&quot;, and the mechanism was eventually adopted as one of two security frameworks in SNMP v3.

==== 64-bit counters ====
SNMP version 2 introduces the option for 64-bit data counters. Version 1 was designed only with 32-bit counters, which can store integer values from zero to 4.29 billion (precisely ). A 32-bit version 1 counter cannot store the maximum speed of a 10 gigabit or larger interface, expressed in bits per second. Similarly, a 32-bit counter tracking statistics for a 10 gigabit or larger interface can roll over back to zero again in less than one minute, which may be a shorter time interval than a counter is polled to read its current state. This would result in lost or invalid data due to the undetected value rollover, and corruption of trend-tracking data.

The 64-bit version 2 counter can store values from zero to 18.4 quintillion (precisely 18,446,744,073,709,551,615) and so is currently unlikely to experience a counter rollover between polling events. For example, 1.6 terabit Ethernet is predicted to become available by 2025. A 64-bit counter incrementing at a rate of 1.6 trillion bits per second would be able to retain information for such an interface without rolling over for 133 days.

=== SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c interoperability ===
SNMPv2c is incompatible with SNMPv1 in two key areas: message formats and protocol operations. SNMPv2c messages use different header and protocol data unit (PDU) formats than SNMPv1 messages. SNMPv2c also uses two protocol operations that are not specified in SNMPv1. To overcome incompatibility, defines two SNMPv1/v2c coexistence strategies: proxy agents and bilingual network-management systems.

==== Proxy agents ====
An SNMPv2 agent can act as a proxy agent on behalf of SNMPv1-managed devices. When an SNMPv2 NMS issues a command intended for an SNMPv1 agent it sends it to the SNMPv2 proxy agent instead. The proxy agent forwards codice_1, codice_2, and codice_3 messages to the SNMPv1 agent unchanged. GetBulk messages are converted by the proxy agent to codice_2 messages and then are forwarded to the SNMPv1 agent. Additionally, the proxy agent receives and maps SNMPv1 trap messages to SNMPv2 trap messages and then forwards them to the NMS.

==== Bilingual network-management system ====
Bilingual SNMPv2 network-management systems support both SNMPv1 and SNMPv2. To support this dual-management environment, a management application examines information stored in a local database to determine whether the agent supports SNMPv1 or SNMPv2. Based on the information in the database, the NMS communicates with the agent using the appropriate version of SNMP.

=== Version 3 ===

Although SNMPv3 makes no changes to the protocol aside from the addition of cryptographic security, it looks very different due to new textual conventions, concepts, and terminology. The most visible change was to define a secure version of SNMP, by adding security and remote configuration enhancements to SNMP. The security aspect is addressed by offering both strong authentication and data encryption for privacy. For the administration aspect, SNMPv3 focuses on two parts, namely notification originators and proxy forwarders. The changes also facilitate remote configuration and administration of the SNMP entities, as well as addressing issues related to the large-scale deployment, accounting, and fault management.

Features and enhancements included:
* Identification of SNMP entities to facilitate communication only between known SNMP entities – Each SNMP entity has an identifier called the SNMPEngineID, and SNMP communication is possible only if an SNMP entity knows the identity of its peer. Traps and Notifications are exceptions to this rule.
* Support for security models – A security model may define the security policy within an administrative domain or an intranet. SNMPv3 contains the specifications for a user-based security model (USM).
* Definition of security goals where the goals of message authentication service include protection against the following:
** Modification of Information – Protection against some unauthorized SNMP entity altering in-transit messages generated by an authorized principal.
** Masquerade – Protection against attempting management operations not authorized for some principal by assuming the identity of another principal that has the appropriate authorizations.
** Message stream modification – Protection against messages getting maliciously re-ordered, delayed, or replayed to affect unauthorized management operations.
** Disclosure – Protection against eavesdropping on the exchanges between SNMP engines.
* Specification for USM – USM consists of the general definition of the following communication mechanisms available:
** Communication without authentication and privacy (NoAuthNoPriv).
** Communication with authentication and without privacy (AuthNoPriv).
** Communication with authentication and privacy (AuthPriv).
* Definition of different authentication and privacy protocols – MD5, SHA and HMAC-SHA-2 authentication protocols and the CBC_DES and CFB_AES_128 privacy protocols are supported in the USM.
* Definition of a discovery procedure – To find the SNMPEngineID of an SNMP entity for a given transport address and transport endpoint address.
* Definition of the time synchronization procedure – To facilitate authenticated communication between the SNMP entities.
* Definition of the SNMP framework MIB – To facilitate remote configuration and administration of the SNMP entity.
* Definition of the USM MIBs – To facilitate remote configuration and administration of the security module.
* Definition of the view-based access control model (VACM) MIBs – To facilitate remote configuration and administration of the access control module.

Security was one of the biggest weaknesses of SNMP until v3. Authentication in SNMP Versions 1 and 2 amounts to nothing more than a password (community string) sent in clear text between a manager and agent. Each SNMPv3 message contains security parameters that are encoded as an octet string. The meaning of these security parameters depends on the security model being used. The security approach in v3 targets:
* Confidentiality – Encryption of packets to prevent snooping by an unauthorized source.
* Integrity – Message integrity to ensure that a packet has not been tampered while in transit including an optional packet replay protection mechanism.
* Authentication – to verify that the message is from a valid source.

v3 also defines the USM and VACM, which were later followed by a transport security model (TSM) that provided support for SNMPv3 over SSH and SNMPv3 over TLS and DTLS.
* USM (User-based Security Model) provides authentication and privacy (encryption) functions and operates at the message level. 
* VACM (View-based Access Control Model) determines whether a given principal is allowed access to a particular MIB object to perform specific functions and operates at the PDU level.
* TSM (Transport Security Model) provides a method for authenticating and encrypting messages over external security channels. Two transports, SSH and TLS/DTLS, have been defined that make use of the TSM specification.

 the IETF recognizes &quot;Simple Network Management Protocol version 3&quot; as defined by – (also known as STD0062) as the current standard version of SNMP. The IETF has designated SNMPv3 a full Internet standard, the highest maturity level for an RFC. It considers earlier versions to be obsolete (designating them variously &quot;Historic&quot; or &quot;Obsolete&quot;).

== Implementation issues ==
SNMP&#x27;s powerful write capabilities, which would allow the configuration of network devices, are not being fully utilized by many vendors, partly because of a lack of security in SNMP versions before SNMPv3, and partly because many devices simply are not capable of being configured via individual MIB object changes.

Some SNMP values (especially tabular values) require specific knowledge of table indexing schemes, and these index values are not necessarily consistent across platforms. This can cause correlation issues when fetching information from multiple devices that may not employ the same table indexing scheme (for example fetching disk utilization metrics, where a specific disk identifier is different across platforms.)

Some major equipment vendors tend to over-extend their proprietary command line interface (CLI) centric configuration and control systems.

In February 2002 the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (CM-SEI) Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (CERT-CC) issued an Advisory on SNMPv1, after the Oulu University Secure Programming Group conducted a thorough analysis of SNMP message handling. Most SNMP implementations, regardless of which version of the protocol they support, use the same program code for decoding protocol data units (PDU) and problems were identified in this code. Other problems were found with decoding SNMP trap messages received by the SNMP management station or requests received by the SNMP agent on the network device. Many vendors had to issue patches for their SNMP implementations.

== Security implications ==

=== Using SNMP to attack a network ===
Because SNMP is designed to allow administrators to monitor and configure network devices remotely it can also be used to penetrate a network. A significant number of software tools can scan the entire network using SNMP, therefore mistakes in the configuration of the read-write mode can make a network susceptible to attacks.

In 2001, Cisco released information that indicated that, even in read-only mode, the SNMP implementation of Cisco IOS is vulnerable to certain denial of service attacks. These security issues can be fixed through an IOS upgrade.

If SNMP is not used in a network it should be disabled in network devices. When configuring SNMP read-only mode, close attention should be paid to the configuration of the access control and from which IP addresses SNMP messages are accepted. If the SNMP servers are identified by their IP, SNMP is only allowed to respond to these IPs and SNMP messages from other IP addresses would be denied. However, IP address spoofing remains a security concern.

=== Authentication ===
SNMP is available in different versions, and each version has its own security issues. SNMP v1 sends passwords in plaintext over the network. Therefore, passwords can be read with packet sniffing. SNMP v2 allows password hashing with MD5, but this has to be configured. Virtually all network management software support SNMP v1, but not necessarily SNMP v2 or v3. SNMP v2 was specifically developed to provide data security, that is authentication, privacy and authorization, but only SNMP version 2c gained the endorsement of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), while versions 2u and 2* failed to gain IETF approval due to security issues. SNMP v3 uses MD5, Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) and keyed algorithms to offer protection against unauthorized data modification and spoofing attacks. If a higher level of security is needed the Data Encryption Standard (DES) can be optionally used in the cipher block chaining mode. SNMP v3 is implemented on Cisco IOS since release 12.0(3)T.

SNMPv3 may be subject to brute force and dictionary attacks for guessing the authentication keys, or encryption keys, if these keys are generated from short (weak) passwords or passwords that can be found in a dictionary. SNMPv3 allows both providing random uniformly distributed cryptographic keys and generating cryptographic keys from a password supplied by the user. The risk of guessing authentication strings from hash values transmitted over the network depends on the cryptographic hash function used and the length of the hash value. SNMPv3 uses the HMAC-SHA-2 authentication protocol for the User-based Security Model (USM). SNMP does not use a more secure challenge-handshake authentication protocol. SNMPv3 (like other SNMP protocol versions) is a stateless protocol, and it has been designed with a minimal amount of interactions between the agent and the manager. Thus introducing a challenge-response handshake for each command would impose a burden on the agent (and possibly on the network itself) that the protocol designers deemed excessive and unacceptable.

The security deficiencies of all SNMP versions can be mitigated by IPsec authentication and confidentiality mechanisms. SNMP also may be carried securely over Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).

Many SNMP implementations include a type of automatic discovery where a new network component, such as a switch or router, is discovered and polled automatically. In SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c this is done through a &quot;community string&quot; that is transmitted in clear-text to other devices. Clear-text passwords are a significant security risk. Once the community string is known outside the organization it could become the target for an attack. To alert administrators of other attempts to glean community strings, SNMP can be configured to pass community-name authentication failure traps. If SNMPv2 is used, the issue can be avoided by enabling password encryption on the SNMP agents of network devices.

The common default configuration for community strings are &quot;public&quot; for read-only access and &quot;private&quot; for read-write. Because of the well-known defaults, SNMP topped the list of the SANS Institute&#x27;s Common Default Configuration Issues and was number ten on the SANS Top 10 Most Critical Internet Security Threats for the year 2000. System and network administrators frequently do not change these configurations.

Whether it runs over TCP or UDP, SNMPv1 and v2 are vulnerable to IP spoofing attacks. With spoofing, attackers may bypass device access lists in agents that are implemented to restrict SNMP access. SNMPv3 security mechanisms such as USM or TSM can prevent spoofing attacks.

<text>Simplex signaling (SX) is signaling in which two conductors are used for a single telecommunication circuit, and a center-tapped coil, or its equivalent, is used to split the signaling current equally between the two conductors. The return path for the current is through ground. 

It is distinct from a phantom circuit in which the return current path for power or signaling is provided through different signal conductors.
SX signaling may be one-way, for intra-central-office use, or the simplex legs may be connected to form full-duplex signaling circuits that function like composite (CX) signaling circuits with E&amp;M lead control.

Simplex is also used to describe a powering method where one or more signal conductors carries direct current to power a remote device, which sends its output signal back on the same conductor. Phantom powering as used in audio is a form of simplex powering, as the return current flows through the ground or shield conductor.

<text>The signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SINAD) is a measure of the quality of a signal from a communications device, often defined as
:formula_1
where formula_2 is the average power of the signal, noise and distortion components. The noise power term can include both thermal noise and quantization noise. SINAD is usually expressed in dB and is quoted alongside the receiver RF sensitivity, to give a quantitative evaluation of the receiver sensitivity. Note that with this definition, unlike SNR, a SINAD reading can never be less than 1 (i.e. it is always positive when quoted in dB).

When calculating the distortion, it is common to exclude the DC components.

Due to widespread use, SINAD has collected several different definitions. SINAD is commonly defined as:
#The ratio of (a) total received power, i.e., the signal to (b) the noise-plus-distortion power. This is modeled by the equation above.
#The ratio of (a) the power of a test signal, i.e. a sine wave, to (b) the residual received power, i.e. noise-plus-distortion power. With this definition, it is possible to have a SINAD level less than one. This definition is used in the calculation of effective number of bits (ENOB) for DACs and ADCs.
Information on the relations between SINAD, ENOB, SNR, THD and SFDR can be found in the footnotes of this article.

==Commercial radio specifications==
A typical example, quoted from a commercial hand held VHF or UHF radio, might be:

:Receiver sensitivity: 0.25 μV at 12 dB SINAD.

This is stating that the receiver will produce intelligible speech with a signal at its input as low as 0.25 μV. Radio receiver designers will test the product in a laboratory using a procedure, which is typically as follows:
* With no signal present on the input, the noise and distortion of the receiver are measured at a convenient level.
* A signal is applied to the input such that the output increases by 12 dB.
* The level of the signal needed to produce this is noted. In this case, it was found to be 0.25 microvolts.

According to the radio designer, intelligible speech can be detected 12 dB above the receiver&#x27;s noise floor (noise and distortion). Regardless of the accuracy of this output power in regards to intelligible speech, having a standard output SINAD allows easy comparison between radio receiver input sensitivities. This 0.25 μV value is typical for VHF commercial radio, while 0.35 μV is probably more typical for UHF. In the real world, lower SINAD values (more noise) can still result in intelligible speech, but it is tiresome work to listen to a voice in that much noise.

<text>In telephony, single-frequency signaling (SF or SF tone) is line signaling in which dial pulses or supervisory signals are conveyed by a single-frequency tone in each direction in the voice-band. SF and similar systems were used in 20th-century carrier systems.

An SF signaling unit converts DC signaling (usually, at least in long-distance circuits, E&amp;M signaling) to a format (characterized by the presence or absence of a single voice-frequency tone), which is suitable for transmission over an AC path, &quot;e.g.&quot;, a carrier system. The SF tone is present in the on-hook or idle state and absent during the seized state. In the seized state, dial pulses are conveyed by bursts of SF tone, corresponding to the interruptions in dc continuity created by a rotary dial or other DC dialing mechanism. 

The SF tone may occupy a small portion of the user data channel spectrum, &quot;e.g.,&quot; 1600 Hz or 2600 Hz (SF &quot;in-band signaling)&quot;. There may be a notch filter at the precise SF frequency, either filtering the circuit at all times or only when the circuit is off-hook, to prevent the user from inadvertently disconnecting a call if the users voice has a sufficiently strong spectral content at the SF frequency, a falsing condition known as &quot;talk-off&quot;. Notoriously, this property was exploited by blue boxers and other toll fraudsters. The SF tone may also be just outside the user voice band, &quot;e.g.,&quot; 3600 Hz. 

The Defense Data Network (DDN) transmitted DC line signaling pulses or supervisory signals, or both, over carrier channels or cable pairs on a four-wire circuit basis using a 2600 Hz signal tone. The conversion into tones, or vice versa, is done by SF signal units.

SF was developed in the early 20th century and standardized in middle century. It declined in the 1970s due to the adoption of T-carrier, and was largely abandoned late in the century in favor of common-channel signaling.

SF tones can transmit data that only consists of everyday telephone numbers, numbers which only have 0-9 in them. How many pulses are transmitted in one time is part of the number that is dialed. One pulse is 1, two pulses are 2, three pulses are 3 and so on, with 10 pulses being 0.

<text>In fiber-optic communication, a single-mode optical fiber (SMF), also known as fundamental- or mono-mode, is an optical fiber designed to carry only a single mode of light - the transverse mode. Modes are the possible solutions of the Helmholtz equation for waves, which is obtained by combining Maxwell&#x27;s equations and the boundary conditions. These modes define the way the wave travels through space, i.e. how the wave is distributed in space. Waves can have the same mode but have different frequencies. This is the case in single-mode fibers, where we can have waves with different frequencies, but of the same mode, which means that they are distributed in space in the same way, and that gives us a single ray of light. Although the ray travels parallel to the length of the fiber, it is often called transverse mode since its electromagnetic oscillations occur perpendicular (transverse) to the length of the fiber. The 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Charles K. Kao for his theoretical work on the single-mode optical fiber. The standards G.652 and G.657 define the most widely used forms of single-mode optical fiber.

==History==
In 1961, Elias Snitzer while working at American Optical published a comprehensive theoretical description of single mode fibers in the Journal of the Optical Society of America.

At the Corning Glass Works (now Corning Inc.), Robert Maurer, Donald Keck and Peter Schultz started with fused silica, a material that can be made extremely pure, but has a high melting point and a low refractive index. They made cylindrical preforms by depositing purified materials from the vapor phase, adding carefully controlled levels of dopants to make the refractive index of the core slightly higher than that of the cladding, without raising attenuation dramatically. In September 1970, they announced they had made single-mode fibers with attenuation at the 633-nanometer helium-neon line below 20 dB/km.

==Characteristics==
Unlike multi-mode optical fiber, single-mode fiber does not exhibit modal dispersion. This is due to the fiber having such a small cross section that only the first mode is transported. Single-mode fibers are therefore better at retaining the fidelity of each light pulse over longer distances than multi-mode fibers. For these reasons, single-mode fibers can have a higher bandwidth than multi-mode fibers. Equipment for single-mode fiber is more expensive than equipment for multi-mode optical fiber, but the single-mode fiber itself is usually cheaper in bulk. 

A typical single-mode optical fiber has a core diameter between 8 and 10.5 μm and a cladding diameter of 125 μm. There are a number of special types of single-mode optical fiber which have been chemically or physically altered to give special properties, such as dispersion-shifted fiber and nonzero dispersion-shifted fiber. Data rates are limited by polarization mode dispersion and chromatic dispersion. , data rates of up to 10 gigabits per second were possible at distances of over with commercially available transceivers (Xenpak). By using optical amplifiers and dispersion-compensating devices, state-of-the-art DWDM optical systems can span thousands of kilometers at 10 Gbit/s, and several hundred kilometers at 40 Gbit/s.

The lowest-order bounds mode is ascertained for the wavelength of interest by solving Maxwell&#x27;s equations for the boundary conditions imposed by the fiber, which are determined by the core diameter and the refractive indices of the core and cladding. The solution of Maxwell&#x27;s equations for the lowest order bound mode will permit a pair of orthogonally polarized fields in the fiber, and this is the usual case in a communication fiber.

In step-index guides, single-mode operation occurs when the normalized frequency, &quot;V&quot;, is less than or equal to 2.405. For power-law profiles, single-mode operation occurs for a normalized frequency, &quot;V&quot;, less than approximately 
:formula_1, 
where &quot;g&quot; is the profile parameter.

In practice, the orthogonal polarizations may not be associated with degenerate modes.

OS1 and OS2 are standard single-mode optical fiber used with wavelengths 1310 nm and 1550 nm (size 9/125 μm) with a maximum attenuation of 1 dB/km (OS1) and 0.4 dB/km (OS2). OS1 is defined in ISO/IEC 11801, and OS2 is defined in ISO/IEC 24702.

==Connectors==
Optical fiber connectors are used to join optical fibers where a connect/disconnect capability is required. The basic connector unit is a connector assembly. A connector assembly consists of an adapter and two connector plugs. 
Due to the sophisticated polishing and tuning procedures that may be incorporated into optical connector manufacturing, connectors are generally assembled onto optical fiber in a supplier&#x27;s manufacturing facility. However, the assembly and
polishing operations involved can be performed in the field, for example to make cross-connect jumpers to size.

Optical fiber connectors are used in telephone company central offices, at installations on customer premises, and in outside plant applications. Their uses include:
* Making the connection between equipment and the telephone plant in the central office
* Connecting fibers to remote and outside plant electronics such as optical network units (ONUs) and digital loop carrier (DLC) systems
* Optical cross connects in the central office
* Patching panels in the outside plant to provide architectural flexibility and to interconnect fibers belonging to different service providers
* Connecting couplers, splitters, and wavelength-division multiplexers (WDMs) to optical fibers
* Connecting optical test equipment to fibers for testing and maintenance.

Outside plant applications may involve locating connectors underground in subsurface enclosures that may be subject to flooding, on outdoor walls, or on utility poles. The closures that enclose them may be hermetic, or may be “free-breathing.” Hermetic closures will prevent the connectors within being subjected to temperature swings unless they are breached. Free-breathing enclosures will subject them to temperature and humidity swings, and possibly to condensation and biological action from airborne bacteria, insects, etc. Connectors in the underground plant may be subjected to groundwater immersion if the closures containing them are breached or improperly assembled.

The latest industry requirements for optical fiber connectors are in Telcordia GR-326, &quot;Generic Requirements for Single-Mode Optical Connectors and Jumper Assemblies&quot;.

A &quot;multi-fiber&quot; optical connector is designed to simultaneously join multiple optical fibers together, with each optical fiber being joined to only one other optical fiber.

The last part of the definition is included so as not to confuse multi-fiber connectors with a branching component, such as a coupler. The latter joins one optical fiber to two or more other optical fibers.

Multi-fiber optical connectors are designed to be used wherever quick and/or repetitive connects and disconnects of a group of fibers are needed. Applications include telecommunications companies’ central offices (COs), installations on customer premises, and outside plant (OSP) applications.

The multi-fiber optical connector can be used in the creation of a low-cost switch for use in fiber optical testing. Another application is in cables delivered to a user with pre-terminated multi-fiber jumpers. This would reduce the need for field splicing, which could greatly reduce the number of hours necessary for placing an optical fiber cable in a telecommunications network. This, in turn, would result in savings for the installer of such cable.

Industry requirements for multi-fiber optical connectors are covered in GR-1435, &quot;Generic Requirements for Multi-Fiber Optical Connectors&quot;.

==Fiber optic switches==
An optical switch is a component with two or more ports that selectively transmits, redirects, or blocks an optical signal in a transmission medium. According to Telcordia GR-1073, an optical switch must be actuated to select or change between states. The actuating signal (also referred to as the control signal) is usually electrical, but in principle, could be optical or mechanical. (The control signal format may be Boolean and may be an independent signal; or, in the case of optical actuation, the control signal may be encoded in the input data signal. Switch performance is generally intended to be independent of wavelength within the component passband.)

==Quadruply clad fiber==
In fiber optics, a quadruply clad fiber is a single-mode optical fiber that has four claddings. Each cladding has a refractive index lower than that of the core. With respect to one another, their relative refractive indices are, in order of distance from the core: lowest, highest, lower, higher. 

A quadruply clad fiber has the advantage of very low macrobending losses. It also has two zero-dispersion points, and moderately low dispersion over a wider wavelength range than a singly clad fiber or a doubly clad fiber.

==Advantages==
* No degradation of signal
* Low dispersion
* Good suitability for long distance communication

==Disadvantages==
* More difficult manufacturing and handling
* Higher price
* Difficult coupling of light into the fiber

<text>The S interface or S reference point, also known as S0, is a user–network interface reference point in an ISDN BRI environment, characterized by a four-wire circuit using 144kbit/s (2 bearer and 1 signaling channel; 2B+D) user rate.

The S interface is the connection between ISDN terminal equipment (TE) or terminal adapters (TAs) and an NT1 (network terminator, type 1.) Not all TE or TAs connect externally to an S interface, but instead integrate an NT1 so they can connect directly to a U interface (local loop from central office.)

Contrast to the T interface, which connects between an NT2 (PBX or other local switching device) and NT1. However, the S interface is electrically equivalent to the T interface, and the two are jointly referred to as the S/T interface.

The S interface operates at 4000 48-bit frames per second; i.e., 192kbit/s, with a user portion of 36bits per frame; i.e., 144kbit/s.

<doc id="41719" wikidata="Q1422637" url="?curid=41719" title="Skip zone">
<text>A skip zone, also called a silent zone or zone of silence, is a region where a radio transmission can not be received. The zone is located between regions both closer and farther from the transmitter where reception is possible.

==Cause==
When using medium to high-frequency radio telecommunication, there are radio waves which travel both parallel to the ground, and towards the ionosphere, referred to as a ground wave and sky wave, respectively. A skip zone is an annular region between the farthest points at which the ground wave can be received and the nearest point at which the refracted sky waves can be received. Within this region, no signal can be received because, due to the conditions of the local ionosphere, the relevant sky waves are not reflected but penetrate the ionosphere.

The skip zone is a natural phenomenon that cannot be influenced by technical means. Its width depends on the height and shape of the ionosphere and, particularly, on the local ionospheric maximum electron density characterized by critical frequency foF2. It varies mainly with this parameter, being larger for low foF2. With a fixed working frequency it is large by night and may even disappear by day. Transmitting at night is most effective for long-distance communication but the skip zone becomes significantly larger. 
Very high frequency waves and higher normally travel through the ionosphere wherefore communication via skywave is exceptional. A highly ionized Es-Layer that occasionally may appear in summer may produce such Sporadic E propagation.

==Avoidance==

A method of decreasing the skip zone is by decreasing the frequency of the radio waves. Decreasing the frequency is akin to increasing the ionospheric width. A point is eventually reached when decreasing the frequency results in a zero distance skip zone. In other words, a frequency exists for which vertically incident radio waves will always be refracted back to the Earth. This frequency is equivalent to the ionospheric plasma frequency and is also known as the ionospheric critical frequency, or foF2.

==Other==
Skip zone is the subject of a film &#x27;SKIPZONE&#x27; made in 1992 by UK artist, Peter Lee-Jones. It refers to areas in Scottish Highlands where it is difficult to obtain radio and TV reception.

In the episode &quot;Short Wave&quot; of &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;, the family hears a distress call from a small boat at sea. Jim explains that the reason they, and not the Coast Guard, can hear the transmission is because of a &quot;skip&quot;.

<text>In radio electronics, especially radar terminology, slant range or slant distance is the distance along the relative direction between two points. If the two points are at the same level (relative to a specific datum), the slant distance equals the horizontal distance. 

An example of slant range is the distance to an aircraft flying at high altitude with respect to that of the radar antenna. The slant range (1) is the hypotenuse of the triangle represented by the altitude of the aircraft and the distance between the radar antenna and the aircraft&#x27;s ground track (point (3) on the earth directly below the aircraft). In the absence of altitude information, for example from a height finder, the aircraft location would be plotted further (2) from the antenna than its actual ground track.

<text>In telecommunication and horology, a slave clock is a clock that depends on another clock, the master clock. Modern clocks are synchronized through the Internet or by radio time signals, to Coordinated Universal Time. UTC is based on a network of atomic clocks in many countries. For scientific purposes, precision clocks can be synchronized to within nanoseconds by dedicated satellite channels. Slave clock synchronization is usually achieved by phase-locking the slave clock signal to a signal received from the master clock. To adjust for the transit time of the signal from the master clock to the slave clock, the phase of the slave clocks are adjusted so that both clocks are in phase. Thus, the time markers of both clocks, at the output of the clocks, occur simultaneously.

The predecessors of atomic clocks, computer clocks, and digital clocks, these electric clocks were synchronized by an electrical pulse, wired to their master clock in the same facility. Thus the terms &quot;master&quot; and &quot;slave.&quot; From the late 19th to the mid 20th centuries, electrical master/slave clock systems were installed, all clocks in a building or facility synchronized through electric wires to a central master clock. Slave clocks either kept time by themselves, and were periodically corrected by the master clock, or required impulses from the master clock. Many slave clocks of these types were in operation, most commonly in schools, offices, military bases, hospitals, railway networks, telephone exchanges and factories the world over. School bells of elementary schools, high schools, and others were able to be synchronized across an entire campus, connected to the system. In schools, the master clock was in the principal&#x27;s office, with slave units in classrooms which were in other buildings on campus. In factories, a system with a bell or horn could signal the end of a shift, lunchtime or break time. Very few relics of this electrical, analogue system operate in the 21st century. Most 21st century systems of the type are digital.

<text>Specific detectivity, or D*, for a photodetector is a figure of merit used to characterize performance, equal to the reciprocal of noise-equivalent power (NEP), normalized per square root of the sensor&#x27;s area and frequency bandwidth (reciprocal of twice the integration time).

Specific detectivity is given by formula_1, where formula_2 is the area of the photosensitive region of the detector, formula_3 is the bandwidth, and NEP the noise equivalent power in units [W]. It is commonly expressed in &quot;Jones&quot; units (formula_4) in honor of Robert Clark Jones who originally defined it.

Given that noise-equivalent power can be expressed as a function of the responsivity formula_5 (in units of formula_6 or formula_7) and the noise spectral density formula_8 (in units of formula_9 or formula_10) as formula_11, it is common to see the specific detectivity expressed as formula_12.

It is often useful to express the specific detectivity in terms of relative noise levels present in the device. A common expression is given below.
: formula_13

With &quot;q&quot; as the electronic charge, formula_14 is the wavelength of interest, &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant, &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light, &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant, &quot;T&quot; is the temperature of the detector, formula_15 is the zero-bias dynamic resistance area product (often measured experimentally, but also expressible in noise level assumptions), formula_16 is the quantum efficiency of the device, and formula_17 is the total flux of the source (often a blackbody) in photons/sec/cm2.

== Detectivity measurement ==
Detectivity can be measured from a suitable optical setup using known parameters.
You will need a known light source with known irradiance at a given standoff distance. The incoming light source will be chopped at a certain frequency, and then each wavelength will be integrated over a given time constant over a given number of frames.

In detail, we compute the bandwidth formula_3 directly from the integration time constant formula_19.
: formula_20

Next, an average signal and rms noise needs to be measured from a set of formula_21 frames. This is done either directly by the instrument, or done as post-processing.
: formula_22
: formula_23

Now, the computation of the radiance formula_24 in W/sr/cm2 must be computed where cm2 is the emitting area. Next, emitting area must be converted into a projected area and the solid angle; this product is often called the etendue. This step can be obviated by the use of a calibrated source, where the exact number of photons/s/cm2 is known at the detector. If this is unknown, it can be estimated using the black-body radiation equation, detector active area formula_25 and the etendue. This ultimately converts the outgoing radiance of the black body in W/sr/cm2 of emitting area into one of W observed on the detector.

The broad-band responsivity, is then just the signal weighted by this wattage.
: formula_26
where
* formula_27 is the responsivity in units of Signal / W, (or sometimes V/W or A/W)
* formula_24 is the outgoing radiance from the black body (or light source) in W/sr/cm2 of emitting area
* formula_29 is the total integrated etendue between the emitting source and detector surface
* formula_25 is the detector area
* formula_31 is the solid angle of the source projected along the line connecting it to the detector surface.

From this metric noise-equivalent power can be computed by taking the noise level over the responsivity.
: formula_32

Similarly, noise-equivalent irradiance can be computed using the responsivity in units of photons/s/W instead of in units of the signal.
Now, the detectivity is simply the noise-equivalent power normalized to the bandwidth and detector area.
: formula_33

<text>In telecommunications, spectral width is the width of a spectral band, i.e., the range of wavelengths or frequencies over which the magnitude of all spectral components is significant, i.e., equal to or greater than a specified fraction of the largest magnitude.

In fiber-optic communication applications, the usual method of specifying spectral width is the &quot;full width at half maximum&quot; (FWHM). This is the same convention used in bandwidth, defined as the frequency range where power drops by less than half (at most −3 dB).

The FWHM method may be difficult to apply when the spectrum has a complex shape. Another method of specifying spectral width is a special case of root-mean-square deviation where the independent variable is wavelength, λ, and &quot;f&quot; (λ) is a suitable radiometric quantity.

The &quot;relative spectral width&quot;, Δλ/λ, is frequently used where Δλ is obtained according to note 1, and λ is the center wavelength.

<doc id="41734" wikidata="Q958957" url="?curid=41734" title="Spread spectrum">
<text>In telecommunications, especially radio communication, spread spectrum are techniques by which a signal (e.g., an electrical, electromagnetic, or acoustic) generated with a particular bandwidth is deliberately spread in the frequency domain over a wider frequency band. Spread-spectrum techniques are used for the establishment of secure communications, increasing resistance to natural interference, noise, and jamming, to prevent detection, to limit power flux density (e.g., in satellite downlinks), and to enable multiple-access communications.

==Telecommunications==
Spread spectrum generally makes use of a sequential noise-like signal structure to spread the normally narrowband information signal over a relatively wideband (radio) band of frequencies. The receiver correlates the received signals to retrieve the original information signal. Originally there were two motivations: either to resist enemy efforts to jam the communications (anti-jam, or AJ), or to hide the fact that communication was even taking place, sometimes called low probability of intercept (LPI).

Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS), direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS), time-hopping spread spectrum (THSS), chirp spread spectrum (CSS), and combinations of these techniques are forms of spread spectrum. The first two of these techniques employ pseudorandom number sequences—created using pseudorandom number generators—to determine and control the spreading pattern of the signal across the allocated bandwidth. Wireless standard IEEE 802.11 uses either FHSS or DSSS in its radio interface.

* Techniques known since the 1940s and used in military communication systems since the 1950s &quot;spread&quot; a radio signal over a wide frequency range several magnitudes higher than minimum requirement. The core principle of spread spectrum is the use of noise-like carrier waves, and, as the name implies, bandwidths much wider than that required for simple point-to-point communication at the same data rate.
* Resistance to jamming (interference). Direct sequence (DS) is good at resisting continuous-time narrowband jamming, while frequency hopping (FH) is better at resisting pulse jamming. In DS systems, narrowband jamming affects detection performance about as much as if the amount of jamming power is spread over the whole signal bandwidth, where it will often not be much stronger than background noise. By contrast, in narrowband systems where the signal bandwidth is low, the received signal quality will be severely lowered if the jamming power happens to be concentrated on the signal bandwidth.
* Resistance to eavesdropping. The spreading sequence (in DS systems) or the frequency-hopping pattern (in FH systems) is often unknown by anyone for whom the signal is unintended, in which case it obscures the signal and reduces the chance of an adversary making sense of it. Moreover, for a given noise power spectral density (PSD), spread-spectrum systems require the same amount of energy per bit before spreading as narrowband systems and therefore the same amount of power if the bitrate before spreading is the same, but since the signal power is spread over a large bandwidth, the signal PSD is much lower — often significantly lower than the noise PSD — so that the adversary may be unable to determine whether the signal exists at all. However, for mission-critical applications, particularly those employing commercially available radios, spread-spectrum radios do not provide adequate security unless, at a minimum, long nonlinear spreading sequences are used and the messages are encrypted. 
* Resistance to fading. The high bandwidth occupied by spread-spectrum signals offer some frequency diversity; i.e., it is unlikely that the signal will encounter severe multipath fading over its whole bandwidth. In direct-sequence systems, the signal can be detected by using a rake receiver.
* Multiple access capability, known as code-division multiple access (CDMA) or code-division multiplexing (CDM). Multiple users can transmit simultaneously in the same frequency band as long as they use different spreading sequences.

==Invention of frequency hopping==
The idea of trying to protect and avoid interference in radio transmissions dates back to the beginning of radio wave signaling. In 1899, Guglielmo Marconi experimented with frequency-selective reception in an attempt to minimize interference. The concept of Frequency-hopping was adopted by the German radio company Telefunken and also described in part of a 1903 US patent by Nikola Tesla. Radio pioneer Jonathan Zenneck&#x27;s 1908 German book &quot;Wireless Telegraphy&quot; describes the process and notes that Telefunken was using it previously. It saw limited use by the German military in World War I, was put forward by Polish engineer Leonard Danilewicz in 1929, showed up in a patent in the 1930s by Willem Broertjes ( issued Aug. 2, 1932), and in the top-secret US Army Signal Corps World War II communications system named SIGSALY.

During World War II, Golden Age of Hollywood actress Hedy Lamarr and avant-garde composer George Antheil developed an intended jamming-resistant radio guidance system for use in Allied torpedoes, patenting the device under &quot;Secret Communications System&quot; on August 11, 1942. Their approach was unique in that frequency coordination was done with paper player piano rolls, a novel approach which was never put into practice.

== Clock signal generation ==
Spread-spectrum clock generation (SSCG) is used in some synchronous digital systems, especially those containing microprocessors, to reduce the spectral density of the electromagnetic interference (EMI) that these systems generate. A synchronous digital system is one that is driven by a clock signal and, because of its periodic nature, has an unavoidably narrow frequency spectrum. In fact, a perfect clock signal would have all its energy concentrated at a single frequency (the desired clock frequency) and its harmonics.

=== Background ===
Practical synchronous digital systems radiate electromagnetic energy on a number of narrow bands spread on the clock frequency and its harmonics, resulting in a frequency spectrum that, at certain frequencies, can exceed the regulatory limits for electromagnetic interference (e.g. those of the FCC in the United States, JEITA in Japan and the IEC in Europe).

Spread-spectrum clocking avoids this problem by reducing the peak radiated energy and, therefore, its electromagnetic emissions and so comply with electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) regulations. It has become a popular technique to gain regulatory approval because it requires only simple equipment modification. It is even more popular in portable electronics devices because of faster clock speeds and increasing integration of high-resolution LCD displays into ever smaller devices. As these devices are designed to be lightweight and inexpensive, traditional passive, electronic measures to reduce EMI, such as capacitors or metal shielding, are not viable. Active EMI reduction techniques such as spread-spectrum clocking are needed in these cases.

=== Method ===
In PCIe, USB 3.0, and SATA systems, the most common technique is downspreading, via frequency modulation with a lower-frequency source. Spread-spectrum clocking, like other kinds of dynamic frequency change, can also create challenges for designers. Principal among these is clock/data misalignment, or clock skew. A phase-locked loop on the receiving side needs a high enough bandwidth to correctly track a spread-spectrum clock.

Even though SSC compatibility is mandatory on SATA receivers, it is not uncommon to find expander chips having problems dealing with such a clock. Consequently, an ability to disable spread-spectrum clocking in computer systems is considered useful.

=== Effect ===
Note that this method does not reduce total radiated energy, and therefore systems are not necessarily less likely to cause interference. Spreading energy over a larger bandwidth effectively reduces electrical and magnetic readings within narrow bandwidths. Typical measuring receivers used by EMC testing laboratories divide the electromagnetic spectrum into frequency bands approximately 120 kHz wide. If the system under test were to radiate all its energy in a narrow bandwidth, it would register a large peak. Distributing this same energy into a larger bandwidth prevents systems from putting enough energy into any one narrowband to exceed the statutory limits. The usefulness of this method as a means to reduce real-life interference problems is often debated, as it is perceived that spread-spectrum clocking hides rather than resolves higher radiated energy issues by simple exploitation of loopholes in EMC legislation or certification procedures. This situation results in electronic equipment sensitive to narrow bandwidth(s) experiencing much less interference, while those with broadband sensitivity, or even operated at other higher frequencies (such as a radio receiver tuned to a different station), will experience more interference.

FCC certification testing is often completed with the spread-spectrum function enabled in order to reduce the measured emissions to within acceptable legal limits. However, the spread-spectrum functionality may be disabled by the user in some cases. As an example, in the area of personal computers, some BIOS writers include the ability to disable spread-spectrum clock generation as a user setting, thereby defeating the object of the EMI regulations. This might be considered a loophole, but is generally overlooked as long as spread-spectrum is enabled by default.

<doc id="41735" wikidata="Q185585" url="?curid=41735" title="Squelch">
<text>In telecommunications, squelch is a circuit function that acts to suppress the audio (or video) output of a receiver in the absence of a strong input signal. Essentially, squelch is a specialized type of noise gate designed to suppress weak signals. Squelch is used in two-way radios and VHF/UHF radio scanners to eliminate the sound of noise when the radio is not receiving a desired transmission.

==Squelch==

In some designs, the squelch threshold is preset. For example, television squelch settings are usually preset. Receivers in base stations, or repeaters at remote mountain top sites, are usually not adjustable remotely from the control point.

In two-way radios (also known as radiotelephones), the received signal level required to unsquelch (un-mute) the receiver may be fixed or adjustable with a knob or a sequence of button presses. Typically the operator will adjust the control until noise is heard, and then adjust in the opposite direction until the noise is squelched. At this point, a weak signal will unsquelch the receiver and be heard by the operator. Further adjustment will increase the level of signal required to unsquelch the receiver. Some applications have the receiver tied to other equipment that uses the audio muting control voltage, as a &quot;signal present&quot; indication; for example, in a repeater the act of the receiver unmuting will switch on the transmitter. Squelch can be &quot;opened&quot; (turned off), which allows all signals to be heard, including radio frequency noise on the receiving frequency. This can be useful when trying to hear distant or otherwise weak signals, for example in DXing.

Carrier squelch is the most simple variant of all. It functions strictly on the signal strength, such as when a television mutes the audio or blanks the video on &quot;empty&quot; channels, or when a walkie-talkie mutes the audio when no signal is present. Carrier squelch uses receiver Automatic gain control (AGC) to determine the squelch threshold. Single-sideband modulation (SSB) typically uses carrier squelch.

Noise squelch is more reliable than carrier squelch. A noise squelch circuit is noise-operated and can be used in AM or FM receivers, and relies on the receiver quieting in the presence of an AM or FM carrier. To minimize the effects of voice audio on squelch operation, the audio from the receiver&#x27;s detector is passed through a high-pass filter, typically passing 4,000 Hz (4kHz) and above, leaving only high frequency noise. The squelch control adjusts the gain of an amplifier which varies the level of the noise coming out of the filter. This noise is rectified, producing a DC voltage when noise is present. The presence of continuous noise on an idle channel creates a DC voltage which turns the receiver audio off. When a signal with little or no noise is received, the noise-derived voltage is reduced and the receiver audio is unmuted.

Noise squelch can be defeated by intermodulation present in the high-pass band. For this reason, many receivers with noise squelch will also use a carrier squelch set at a higher threshold than the noise squelch.

==Tone squelch and selective calling==
Tone squelch, or another form of selective calling, is sometimes used to solve interference problems. Where more than one user is on the same channel (&quot;co-channel&quot; users), selective calling addresses a subset of all receivers. Instead of turning on the receiver audio for any signal, the audio turns on only in the presence of the correct selective calling code. This is akin to the use of a lock on a door. A carrier squelch is unlocked and will let any signal in. Selective calling locks out all signals except ones with the correct key to the lock (the correct code).

In non-critical uses, selective calling can also be used to hide the presence of interfering signals such as receiver-produced intermodulation. Receivers with poor specifications—such as inexpensive police scanners or low-cost mobile radios—cannot reject the strong signals present in urban environments. The interference will still be present, and will still degrade system performance, but by using selective calling the user will not have to hear the noises produced by receiving the interference.

Four different techniques are commonly used. Selective calling can be regarded as a form of in-band signaling.

===CTCSS===
CTCSS (Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System) continuously superimposes any one of about 50 low-pitch audio tones on the transmitted signal, ranging from 67 to 254 Hz. The original tone set was 10, then 32 tones, and has been expanded even further over the years. CTCSS is often called &quot;PL tone&quot; (for &quot;Private Line&quot;, a trademark of Motorola), or simply &quot;tone squelch&quot;. General Electric&#x27;s implementation of CTCSS is called &quot;Channel Guard&quot; (or &quot;CG&quot;). RCA Corporation used the name &quot;Quiet Channel&quot;, or &quot;QC&quot;. There are many other company-specific names used by radio vendors to describe compatible options. Any CTCSS system that has compatible tones is interchangeable. Old and new radios with CTCSS and radios across manufacturers are compatible. For those PMR446 radios with 38 codes, the codes 0 to 38 are CTCSS Tones:

===SelCall===
Selcall (Selective Calling) transmits a burst of up to five in-band audio tones at the beginning of each transmission. This feature (sometimes called &quot;tone burst&quot;) is common in European systems. Early systems used one tone (commonly called &quot;Tone Burst&quot;). Several tones were used, the most common being 1,750 Hz, which is still used in European amateur radio repeater systems. The addressing scheme provided by one tone was not enough, so a two-tone system was devised—one tone followed by a second tone (sometimes called a &quot;1+1&quot; system). Motorola later marketed a system called &quot;Quik-Call&quot; that used two simultaneous tones followed by two more simultaneous tones (sometimes called a &quot;2+2&quot; system) that was heavily used by fire department dispatch systems in the US. Later selective call systems used paging system technology that made use of a burst of five sequential tones.

===DCS===

DCS (Digital-Coded Squelch), generically known as &quot;CDCSS&quot; (Continuous Digital-Coded Squelch System), was designed as the digital replacement for CTCSS. In the same way that a single CTCSS tone would be used on an entire group of radios, the same DCS code is used in a group of radios. DCS is also referred to as &quot;Digital Private Line&quot; (or &quot;DPL&quot;), another trademark of Motorola, and likewise, General Electric&#x27;s implementation of DCS is referred to as &quot;Digital Channel Guard&quot; (or &quot;DCG&quot;). Despite the fact that it is not a tone, DCS is also called &quot;DTCS&quot; (Digital Tone Code Squelch) by Icom, and other names by other manufacturers. Radios with DCS options are generally compatible, provided the radio&#x27;s encoder-decoder will use the same code as radios in the existing system.

DCS adds a 134.4 bit/s (sub-audible) bitstream to the transmitted audio. The code word is a 23-bit Golay (23,12) code which has the ability to detect and correct errors of 3 or fewer bits. The word consists of 12 data bits followed by 11 check bits. The last 3 data bits are a fixed &#x27;001&#x27;, this leaves 9 code bits (512 possibilities) which are conventionally represented as a 3-digit octal number. Note that the first bit transmitted is the LSB, so the code is &quot;backwards&quot; from the transmitted bit order. Only 83 of the 512 possible codes are available, to prevent falsing due to alignment collisions.

DCS codes are standardized by the Telecommunications Industry Association with the following 83 codes being found in their most recent standard, however, some systems use non-standard codes. For those PMR446 radios with 121 codes, the codes 39 to 121 are DCS codes:

===XTCSS===
XTCSS is the newest signalling technique, and provides 99 codes with the added advantage of &quot;silent operation&quot;. XTCSS-fitted radios are purposed to enjoy more privacy and flexibility of operation. XTCSS is implemented as a combination of CTCSS and in-band signalling.

==Uses==
Squelch was invented first and is still in wide use in two-way radio. Squelch of any kind is used to indicate loss of signal, which is used to keep commercial and amateur radio repeaters from continually transmitting. Since a carrier squelch receiver cannot tell a valid carrier from a spurious signal (noise, etc.), CTCSS is often used as well, as it avoids false keyups. Use of CTCSS is especially helpful on congested frequencies or on frequency bands prone to skip and during band openings.

Professional wireless microphones use squelch to avoid reproducing noise when the receiver does not receive enough signal from the microphone. Most professional models have adjustable squelch, usually set with a screwdriver adjustment or front-panel control on the receiver.

<doc id="41741" wikidata="Q123300" url="?curid=41741" title="Standing wave">
<text>In physics, a standing wave, also known as a stationary wave, is a wave that oscillates in time but whose peak amplitude profile does not move in space. The peak amplitude of the wave oscillations at any point in space is constant with respect to time, and the oscillations at different points throughout the wave are in phase. The locations at which the absolute value of the amplitude is minimum are called nodes, and the locations where the absolute value of the amplitude is maximum are called antinodes.

Standing waves were first described scientifically by Michael Faraday in 1831. Faraday observed standing waves on the surface of a liquid in a vibrating container. Franz Melde coined the term &quot;standing wave&quot; (German: &quot;stehende Welle&quot; or &quot;Stehwelle&quot;) around 1860 and demonstrated the phenomenon in his classic experiment with vibrating strings.

This phenomenon can occur because the medium is moving in the direction opposite to the movement of the wave, or it can arise in a stationary medium as a result of interference between two waves traveling in opposite directions. The most common cause of standing waves is the phenomenon of resonance, in which standing waves occur inside a resonator due to interference between waves reflected back and forth at the resonator&#x27;s resonant frequency.

For waves of equal amplitude traveling in opposing directions, there is on average no net propagation of energy.

== Moving medium ==
As an example of the first type, under certain meteorological conditions standing waves form in the atmosphere in the lee of mountain ranges. Such waves are often exploited by glider pilots.

Standing waves and hydraulic jumps also form on fast flowing river rapids and tidal currents such as the Saltstraumen maelstrom. A requirement for this in river currents is a flowing water with shallow depth in which the inertia of the water overcomes its gravity due to the supercritical flow speed (Froude number: 1.7 – 4.5, surpassing 4.5 results in direct standing wave) and is therefore neither significantly slowed down by the obstacle nor pushed to the side. Many standing river waves are popular river surfing breaks.

== Opposing waves ==
As an example of the second type, a &quot;standing wave&quot; in a transmission line is a wave in which the distribution of current, voltage, or field strength is formed by the superposition of two waves of the same frequency propagating in opposite directions. The effect is a series of nodes (zero displacement) and anti-nodes (maximum displacement) at fixed points along the transmission line. Such a standing wave may be formed when a wave is transmitted into one end of a transmission line and is reflected from the other end by an impedance mismatch, &quot;i.e.&quot;, discontinuity, such as an or a short. The failure of the line to transfer power at the standing wave frequency will usually result in attenuation distortion.

In practice, losses in the transmission line and other components mean that a perfect reflection and a pure standing wave are never achieved. The result is a &quot;partial standing wave&quot;, which is a superposition of a standing wave and a traveling wave. The degree to which the wave resembles either a pure standing wave or a pure traveling wave is measured by the standing wave ratio (SWR).

Another example is standing waves in the open ocean formed by waves with the same wave period moving in opposite directions. These may form near storm centres, or from reflection of a swell at the shore, and are the source of microbaroms and microseisms.

== Mathematical description ==

This section considers representative one- and two-dimensional cases of standing waves. First, an example of an infinite length string shows how identical waves traveling in opposite directions interfere to produce standing waves. Next, two finite length string examples with different boundary conditions demonstrate how the boundary conditions restrict the frequencies that can form standing waves. Next, the example of sound waves in a pipe demonstrates how the same principles can be applied to longitudinal waves with analogous boundary conditions.

Standing waves can also occur in two- or three-dimensional resonators. With standing waves on two-dimensional membranes such as drumheads, illustrated in the animations above, the nodes become nodal lines, lines on the surface at which there is no movement, that separate regions vibrating with opposite phase. These nodal line patterns are called Chladni figures. In three-dimensional resonators, such as musical instrument sound boxes and microwave cavity resonators, there are nodal surfaces. This section includes a two-dimensional standing wave example with a rectangular boundary to illustrate how to extend the concept to higher dimensions.

=== Standing wave on an infinite length string ===

To begin, consider a string of infinite length along the &quot;x&quot;-axis that is free to be stretched transversely in the &quot;y&quot; direction.

For a harmonic wave traveling to the right along the string, the string&#x27;s displacement in the &quot;y&quot; direction as a function of position &quot;x&quot; and time &quot;t&quot; is
:formula_1

The displacement in the &quot;y&quot;-direction for an identical harmonic wave traveling to the left is
:formula_2

where
*&quot;y&quot;max is the amplitude of the displacement of the string for each wave,
*&quot;ω&quot; is the angular frequency or equivalently &quot;2π&quot; times the frequency &quot;f&quot;,
*&quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength of the wave.

For identical right- and left-traveling waves on the same string, the total displacement of the string is the sum of &quot;y&quot;R and &quot;y&quot;L,
:formula_3

Using the trigonometric sum-to-product identity formula_4,
Equation () does not describe a traveling wave. At any position &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;t&quot;) simply oscillates in time with an amplitude that varies in the &quot;x&quot;-direction as formula_5. The animation at the beginning of this article depicts what is happening. As the left-traveling blue wave and right-traveling green wave interfere, they form the standing red wave that does not travel and instead oscillates in place.

Because the string is of infinite length, it has no boundary condition for its displacement at any point along the &quot;x&quot;-axis. As a result, a standing wave can form at any frequency.

At locations on the &quot;x&quot;-axis that are &quot;even&quot; multiples of a quarter wavelength,
:formula_6

the amplitude is always zero. These locations are called nodes. At locations on the &quot;x&quot;-axis that are &quot;odd&quot; multiples of a quarter wavelength
:formula_7

the amplitude is maximal, with a value of twice the amplitude of the right- and left-traveling waves that interfere to produce this standing wave pattern. These locations are called anti-nodes. The distance between two consecutive nodes or anti-nodes is half the wavelength, &quot;λ&quot;/2.

=== Standing wave on a string with two fixed ends ===

Next, consider a string with fixed ends at and . The string will have some damping as it is stretched by traveling waves, but assume the damping is very small. Suppose that at the fixed end a sinusoidal force is applied that drives the string up and down in the y-direction with a small amplitude at some frequency &quot;f&quot;. In this situation, the driving force produces a right-traveling wave. That wave reflects off the right fixed end and travels back to the left, reflects again off the left fixed end and travels back to the right, and so on. Eventually, a steady state is reached where the string has identical right- and left-traveling waves as in the infinite-length case and the power dissipated by damping in the string equals the power supplied by the driving force so the waves have constant amplitude.

Equation () still describes the standing wave pattern that can form on this string, but now Equation () is subject to boundary conditions where at and because the string is fixed at and because we assume the driving force at the fixed end has small amplitude. Checking the values of &quot;y&quot; at the two ends,
:formula_8
:formula_9

This boundary condition is in the form of the Sturm–Liouville formulation. The latter boundary condition is satisfied when formula_10. &quot;L&quot; is given, so the boundary condition restricts the wavelength of the standing waves to

:formula_11

Waves can only form standing waves on this string if they have a wavelength that satisfies this relationship with &quot;L&quot;. If waves travel with speed &quot;v&quot; along the string, then equivalently the frequency of the standing waves is restricted to
:formula_12

The standing wave with oscillates at the fundamental frequency and has a wavelength that is twice the length of the string. Higher integer values of &quot;n&quot; correspond to modes of oscillation called harmonics or overtones. Any standing wave on the string will have &quot;n&quot; + 1 nodes including the fixed ends and &quot;n&quot; anti-nodes.

To compare this example&#x27;s nodes to the description of nodes for standing waves in the infinite length string, Equation () can be rewritten as
:formula_13
:formula_14

In this variation of the expression for the wavelength, &quot;n&quot; must be even. Cross multiplying we see that because &quot;L&quot; is a node, it is an &quot;even&quot; multiple of a quarter wavelength,
:formula_15
:formula_14

This example demonstrates a type of resonance and the frequencies that produce standing waves can be referred to as &quot;resonant frequencies&quot;.

=== Standing wave on a string with one fixed end ===

Next, consider the same string of length &quot;L&quot;, but this time it is only fixed at . At , the string is free to move in the &quot;y&quot; direction. For example, the string might be tied at to a ring that can slide freely up and down a pole. The string again has small damping and is driven by a small driving force at .

In this case, Equation () still describes the standing wave pattern that can form on the string, and the string has the same boundary condition of at . However, at where the string can move freely there should be an anti-node with maximal amplitude of &quot;y&quot;. Equivalently, this boundary condition of the &quot;free end&quot; can be stated as at , which is in the form of the Sturm–Liouville formulation. The intuition for this boundary condition at is that the motion of the &quot;free end&quot; will follow that of the point to its left.

Reviewing Equation (), for the largest amplitude of &quot;y&quot; occurs when , or
:formula_17

This leads to a different set of wavelengths than in the two-fixed-ends example. Here, the wavelength of the standing waves is restricted to
:formula_13
:formula_19

Equivalently, the frequency is restricted to
:formula_20

In this example &quot;n&quot; only takes odd values. Because &quot;L&quot; is an anti-node, it is an &quot;odd&quot; multiple of a quarter wavelength. Thus the fundamental mode in this example only has one quarter of a complete sine cycle–zero at and the first peak at –the first harmonic has three quarters of a complete sine cycle, and so on.

This example also demonstrates a type of resonance and the frequencies that produce standing waves are called &quot;resonant frequencies&quot;.

=== Standing wave in a pipe ===
Consider a standing wave in a pipe of length &quot;L&quot;. The air inside the pipe serves as the medium for longitudinal sound waves traveling to the right or left through the pipe. While the transverse waves on the string from the previous examples vary in their displacement perpendicular to the direction of wave motion, the waves traveling through the air in the pipe vary in terms of their pressure and longitudinal displacement along the direction of wave motion. The wave propagates by alternately compressing and expanding air in segments of the pipe, which displaces the air slightly from its rest position and transfers energy to neighboring segments through the forces exerted by the alternating high and low air pressures. Equations resembling those for the wave on a string can be written for the change in pressure Δ&quot;p&quot; due to a right- or left-traveling wave in the pipe.
:formula_21
:formula_22

where
*&quot;p&quot;max is the pressure amplitude or the maximum increase or decrease in air pressure due to each wave,
*&quot;ω&quot; is the angular frequency or equivalently &quot;2π&quot; times the frequency &quot;f&quot;,
*&quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength of the wave.

If identical right- and left-traveling waves travel through the pipe, the resulting superposition is described by the sum
:formula_23

This formula for the pressure is of the same form as Equation (), so a stationary pressure wave forms that is fixed in space and oscillates in time.

If the end of a pipe is closed, the pressure is maximal since the closed end of the pipe exerts a force that restricts the movement of air. This corresponds to a pressure anti-node (which is a node for molecular motions, because the molecules near the closed end cannot move). If the end of the pipe is open, the pressure variations are very small, corresponding to a pressure node (which is an anti-node for molecular motions, because the molecules near the open end can move freely). The exact location of the pressure node at an open end is actually slightly beyond the open end of the pipe, so the effective length of the pipe for the purpose of determining resonant frequencies is slightly longer than its physical length. This difference in length is ignored in this example. In terms of reflections, open ends partially reflect waves back into the pipe, allowing some energy to be released into the outside air. Ideally, closed ends reflect the entire wave back in the other direction.

First consider a pipe that is open at both ends, for example an open organ pipe or a recorder. Given that the pressure must be zero at both open ends, the boundary conditions are analogous to the string with two fixed ends,
:formula_24
:formula_25

which only occurs when the wavelength of standing waves is
:formula_26
:formula_27

or equivalently when the frequency is
:formula_28

where &quot;v&quot; is the speed of sound.

Next, consider a pipe that is open at (and therefore has a pressure node) and closed at (and therefore has a pressure anti-node). The closed &quot;free end&quot; boundary condition for the pressure at can be stated as , which is in the form of the Sturm–Liouville formulation. The intuition for this boundary condition at is that the pressure of the closed end will follow that of the point to its left. Examples of this setup include a bottle and a clarinet. This pipe has boundary conditions analogous to the string with only one fixed end. Its standing waves have wavelengths restricted to
:formula_13
:formula_30

or equivalently the frequency of standing waves is restricted to
:formula_31

For the case where one end is closed, &quot;n&quot; only takes odd values just like in the case of the string fixed at only one end.

So far, the wave has been written in terms of its pressure as a function of position &quot;x&quot; and time. Alternatively, the wave can be written in terms of its longitudinal displacement of air, where air in a segment of the pipe moves back and forth slightly in the &quot;x&quot;-direction as the pressure varies and waves travel in either or both directions. The change in pressure Δ&quot;p&quot; and longitudinal displacement &quot;s&quot; are related as
:formula_32

where &quot;ρ&quot; is the density of the air. In terms of longitudinal displacement, closed ends of pipes correspond to nodes since air movement is restricted and open ends correspond to anti-nodes since the air is free to move. A similar, easier to visualize phenomenon occurs in longitudinal waves propagating along a spring.

We can also consider a pipe that is closed at both ends. In this case, both ends will be pressure anti-nodes or equivalently both ends will be displacement nodes. This example is analogous to the case where both ends are open, except the standing wave pattern has a phase shift along the &quot;x&quot;-direction to shift the location of the nodes and anti-nodes. For example, the longest wavelength that resonates–the fundamental mode–is again twice the length of the pipe, except that the ends of the pipe have pressure anti-nodes instead of pressure nodes. Between the ends there is one pressure node. In the case of two closed ends, the wavelength is again restricted to
:formula_26
:formula_27

and the frequency is again restricted to
:formula_35

A Rubens tube provides a way to visualize the pressure variations of the standing waves in a tube with two closed ends.

=== 2D standing wave with a rectangular boundary ===

Next, consider transverse waves that can move along a two dimensional surface within a rectangular boundary of length &quot;Lx&quot; in the &quot;x&quot;-direction and length &quot;Ly&quot; in the &quot;y&quot;-direction. Examples of this type of wave are water waves in a pool or waves on a rectangular sheet that has been pulled taut. The waves displace the surface in the &quot;z&quot;-direction, with defined as the height of the surface when it is still.

In two dimensions and Cartesian coordinates, the wave equation is
:formula_36

where
*&quot;z&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;t&quot;) is the displacement of the surface,
*&quot;c&quot; is the speed of the wave.

To solve this differential equation, let&#x27;s first solve for its Fourier transform, with
:formula_37

Taking the Fourier transform of the wave equation,
:formula_38

This is an eigenvalue problem where the frequencies correspond to eigenvalues that then correspond to frequency-specific modes or eigenfunctions. Specifically, this is a form of the Helmholtz equation and it can be solved using separation of variables. Assume
:formula_39

Dividing the Helmholtz equation by &quot;Z&quot;,
:formula_40

This leads to two coupled ordinary differential equations. The &quot;x&quot; term equals a constant with respect to &quot;x&quot; that we can define as
:formula_41

Solving for &quot;X&quot;(&quot;x&quot;),
:formula_42

This &quot;x&quot;-dependence is sinusoidal–recalling Euler&#x27;s formula–with constants &quot;A&quot;&quot;k&quot;&quot;x&quot; and &quot;B&quot;&quot;k&quot;&quot;x&quot; determined by the boundary conditions. Likewise, the &quot;y&quot; term equals a constant with respect to &quot;y&quot; that we can define as
:formula_43

and the dispersion relation for this wave is therefore
:formula_44

Solving the differential equation for the &quot;y&quot; term,
:formula_45

Multiplying these functions together and applying the inverse Fourier transform, &quot;z&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;t&quot;) is a superposition of modes where each mode is the product of sinusoidal functions for &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;t&quot;,
:formula_46

The constants that determine the exact sinusoidal functions depend on the boundary conditions and initial conditions. To see how the boundary conditions apply, consider an example like the sheet that has been pulled taut where &quot;z&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;t&quot;) must be zero all around the rectangular boundary. For the &quot;x&quot; dependence, &quot;z&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;t&quot;) must vary in a way that it can be zero at both and for all values of &quot;y&quot; and &quot;t&quot;. As in the one dimensional example of the string fixed at both ends, the sinusoidal function that satisfies this boundary condition is
:formula_47

with &quot;k&quot;&quot;x&quot; restricted to
:formula_48

Likewise, the &quot;y&quot; dependence of &quot;z&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;t&quot;) must be zero at both and , which is satisfied by
:formula_49

Restricting the wave numbers to these values also restricts the frequencies that resonate to
:formula_50

If the initial conditions for &quot;z&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,0) and its time derivative &quot;ż&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,0) are chosen so the &quot;t&quot;-dependence is a cosine function, then standing waves for this system take the form
:formula_51
:formula_52

So, standing waves inside this fixed rectangular boundary oscillate in time at certain resonant frequencies parameterized by the integers &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot;. As they oscillate in time, they do not travel and their spatial variation is sinusoidal in both the &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-directions such that they satisfy the boundary conditions. The fundamental mode, and , has a single antinode in the middle of the rectangle. Varying &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; gives complicated but predictable two-dimensional patterns of nodes and antinodes inside the rectangle.

From the dispersion relation, in certain situations different modes–meaning different combinations of &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot;–may resonate at the same frequency even though they have different shapes for their &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-dependence. For example, if the boundary is square, , the modes and , and , and and all resonate at
:formula_53

Recalling that &quot;ω&quot; determines the eigenvalue in the Helmholtz equation above, the number of modes corresponding to each frequency relates to the frequency&#x27;s multiplicity as an eigenvalue.

== Standing wave ratio, phase, and energy transfer ==

If the two oppositely moving traveling waves are not of the same amplitude, they will not cancel completely at the nodes, the points where the waves are 180° out of phase, so the amplitude of the standing wave will not be zero at the nodes, but merely a minimum. Standing wave ratio (SWR) is the ratio of the amplitude at the antinode (maximum) to the amplitude at the node (minimum). A pure standing wave will have an infinite SWR. It will also have a constant phase at any point in space (but it may undergo a 180° inversion every half cycle). A finite, non-zero SWR indicates a wave that is partially stationary and partially travelling. Such waves can be decomposed into a superposition of two waves: a travelling wave component and a stationary wave component. An SWR of one indicates that the wave does not have a stationary component – it is purely a travelling wave, since the ratio of amplitudes is equal to 1.

A pure standing wave does not transfer energy from the source to the destination. However, the wave is still subject to losses in the medium. Such losses will manifest as a finite SWR, indicating a travelling wave component leaving the source to supply the losses. Even though the SWR is now finite, it may still be the case that no energy reaches the destination because the travelling component is purely supplying the losses. However, in a lossless medium, a finite SWR implies a definite transfer of energy to the destination.

== Examples ==
One easy example to understand standing waves is two people shaking either end of a jump rope. If they shake in sync the rope can form a regular pattern of waves oscillating up and down, with stationary points along the rope where the rope is almost still (nodes) and points where the arc of the rope is maximum (antinodes).

=== Acoustic resonance ===

Standing waves are also observed in physical media such as strings and columns of air. Any waves traveling along the medium will reflect back when they reach the end. This effect is most noticeable in musical instruments where, at various multiples of a vibrating string or air column&#x27;s natural frequency, a standing wave is created, allowing harmonics to be identified. Nodes occur at fixed ends and anti-nodes at open ends. If fixed at only one end, only odd-numbered harmonics are available. At the open end of a pipe the anti-node will not be exactly at the end as it is altered by its contact with the air and so end correction is used to place it exactly. The density of a string will affect the frequency at which harmonics will be produced; the greater the density the lower the frequency needs to be to produce a standing wave of the same harmonic.

=== Visible light ===
Standing waves are also observed in optical media such as optical waveguides and optical cavities. Lasers use optical cavities in the form of a pair of facing mirrors, which constitute a Fabry–Pérot interferometer. The gain medium in the cavity (such as a crystal) emits light coherently, exciting standing waves of light in the cavity. The wavelength of light is very short (in the range of nanometers, 10−9 m) so the standing waves are microscopic in size. One use for standing light waves is to measure small distances, using optical flats.

=== X-rays ===
Interference between X-ray beams can form an X-ray standing wave (XSW) field. Because of the short wavelength of X-rays (less than 1 nanometer), this phenomenon can be exploited for measuring atomic-scale events at material surfaces. The XSW is generated in the region where an X-ray beam interferes with a diffracted beam from a nearly perfect single crystal surface or a reflection from an X-ray mirror. By tuning the crystal geometry or X-ray wavelength, the XSW can be translated in space, causing a shift in the X-ray fluorescence or photoelectron yield from the atoms near the surface. This shift can be analyzed to pinpoint the location of a particular atomic species relative to the underlying crystal structure or mirror surface. The XSW method has been used to clarify the atomic-scale details of dopants in semiconductors, atomic and molecular adsorption on surfaces, and chemical transformations involved in catalysis.

=== Mechanical waves ===
Standing waves can be mechanically induced into a solid medium using resonance. One easy to understand example is two people shaking either end of a jump rope. If they shake in sync, the rope will form a regular pattern with nodes and antinodes and appear to be stationary, hence the name standing wave. Similarly a cantilever beam can have a standing wave imposed on it by applying a base excitation. In this case the free end moves the greatest distance laterally compared to any location along the beam. Such a device can be used as a sensor to track changes in frequency or phase of the resonance of the fiber. One application is as a measurement device for dimensional metrology.

=== Seismic waves ===
Standing surface waves on the Earth are observed as free oscillations of the Earth.

=== Faraday waves ===
The Faraday wave is a non-linear standing wave at the air-liquid interface induced by hydrodynamic instability. It can be used as a liquid-based template to assemble microscale materials.

=== Seiches ===
A seiche is an example of a standing wave in an enclosed body of water. It is characterised by the oscillatory behaviour of the water level at either end of the body and typically has a nodal point near the middle of the body where very little change in water level is observed. It should be distinguished from a simple storm surge where no oscillation is present. In sizeable lakes, the period of such oscillations may be between minutes and hours, for example Lake Geneva&#x27;s longitudinal period is 73 minutes and its transversal seiche has a period of around 10 minutes, while Lake Huron can be seen to have resonances with periods between 1 and 2 hours. See Lake seiches.

<text>In radio engineering and telecommunications, standing wave ratio (SWR) is a measure of impedance matching of loads to the characteristic impedance of a transmission line or waveguide. Impedance mismatches result in standing waves along the transmission line, and SWR is defined as the ratio of the partial standing wave&#x27;s amplitude at an antinode (maximum) to the amplitude at a node (minimum) along the line.

Voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) (pronounced &quot;vizwar&quot;) is the ratio of maximum to minimum voltage on a transmission line . For example, a VSWR of 1.2 means a peak voltage 1.2 times the minimum voltage along that line, if the line is at least one half wavelength long.

A SWR can be also defined as the ratio of the maximum amplitude to minimum amplitude of the transmission line&#x27;s currents, electric field strength, or the magnetic field strength. Neglecting transmission line loss, these ratios are identical.

The power standing wave ratio (PSWR) is defined as the square of the VSWR, however, this deprecated term has no direct physical relation to power actually involved in transmission.

SWR is usually measured using a dedicated instrument called an SWR meter. Since SWR is a measure of the load impedance relative to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line in use (which together determine the reflection coefficient as described below), a given SWR meter can interpret the impedance it sees in terms of SWR only if it has been designed for the same particular characteristic impedance as the line. In practice most transmission lines used in these applications are coaxial cables with an impedance of either 50 or 75 ohms, so most SWR meters correspond to one of these.

Checking the SWR is a standard procedure in a radio station. Although the same information could be obtained by measuring the load&#x27;s impedance with an impedance analyzer (or &quot;impedance bridge&quot;), the SWR meter is simpler and more robust for this purpose. By measuring the magnitude of the impedance mismatch at the transmitter output it reveals problems due to either the antenna or the transmission line.

==Impedance matching==

SWR is used as a measure of impedance matching of a load to the characteristic impedance of a transmission line carrying radio frequency (RF) signals. This especially applies to transmission lines connecting radio transmitters and receivers with their antennas, as well as similar uses of RF cables such as cable television connections to TV receivers and distribution amplifiers. Impedance matching is achieved when the source impedance is the complex conjugate of the load impedance. The easiest way of achieving this, and the way that minimizes losses along the transmission line, is for the imaginary part of the complex impedance of both the source and load to be zero, that is, pure resistances, equal to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line. When there is a mismatch between the load impedance and the transmission line, part of the forward wave sent toward the load is reflected back along the transmission line towards the source. The source then sees a different impedance than it expects which can lead to lesser (or in some cases, more) power being supplied by it, the result being very sensitive to the electrical length of the transmission line.

Such a mismatch is usually undesired and results in standing waves along the transmission line which magnifies transmission line losses (significant at higher frequencies and for longer cables). The SWR is a measure of the depth of those standing waves and is, therefore, a measure of the matching of the load to the transmission line. A matched load would result in an SWR of 1:1 implying no reflected wave. An infinite SWR represents complete reflection by a load unable to absorb electrical power, with all the incident power reflected back towards the source.

It should be understood that the match of a load to the transmission line is different from the match of a &quot;source&quot; to the transmission line or the match of a source to the load &quot;seen through&quot; the transmission line. For instance, if there is a perfect match between the load impedance load and the source impedance that perfect match will remain if the source and load are connected through a transmission line with an electrical length of one half wavelength (or a multiple of one half wavelengths) using a transmission line of &quot;any&quot; characteristic impedance 0. However the SWR will generally not be 1:1, depending only on load and 0. With a different length of transmission line, the source will see a different impedance than load which may or may not be a good match to the source. Sometimes this is deliberate, as when a quarter-wave matching section is used to improve the match between an otherwise mismatched source and load.

However typical RF sources such as transmitters and signal generators are designed to look into a purely resistive load impedance such as 50Ω or 75Ω, corresponding to common transmission lines&#x27; characteristic impedances. In those cases, matching the load to the transmission line, load 0, &quot;always&quot; ensures that the source will see the same load impedance as if the transmission line weren&#x27;t there. This is identical to a 1:1 SWR. This condition (load 0) also means that the load seen by the source is independent of the transmission line&#x27;s electrical length. Since the electrical length of a physical segment of transmission line depends on the signal frequency, violation of this condition means that the impedance seen by the source through the transmission line becomes a function of frequency (especially if the line is long), even if load is frequency-independent. So in practice, a good SWR (near 1:1) implies a transmitter&#x27;s output seeing the exact impedance it expects for optimum and safe operation.

==Relationship to the reflection coefficient==
The voltage component of a standing wave in a uniform transmission line consists of the forward wave (with complex amplitude formula_1) superimposed on the reflected wave (with complex amplitude formula_2).

A wave is partly reflected when a transmission line is terminated with an impedance unequal to its characteristic impedance. The reflection coefficient formula_3 can be defined as:

:formula_4

or

:formula_5

formula_3 is a complex number that describes both the magnitude and the phase shift of the reflection. The simplest cases with formula_3 &quot;measured at the load&quot; are:
* formula_8: complete negative reflection, when the line is short-circuited,
* formula_9: no reflection, when the line is perfectly matched,
* formula_10: complete positive reflection, when the line is open-circuited.

The SWR directly corresponds to the magnitude of formula_3.

At some points along the line the forward and reflected waves interfere constructively, exactly in phase, with the resulting amplitude formula_12 given by the sum of those waves&#x27; amplitudes:

:formula_13

At other points, the waves interfere 180° out of phase with the amplitudes partially cancelling:

:formula_14

The voltage standing wave ratio is then

:formula_15

Since the magnitude of formula_3 always falls in the range [0,1], the SWR is always greater than or equal to unity. Note that the &quot;phase&quot; of &quot;V&quot;f and &quot;V&quot;r vary along the transmission line in opposite directions to each other. Therefore, the complex-valued reflection coefficient formula_3 varies as well, but only in phase. With the SWR dependent &quot;only&quot; on the complex magnitude of formula_3, it can be seen that the SWR measured at &quot;any&quot; point along the transmission line (neglecting transmission line losses) obtains an identical reading.

Since the power of the forward and reflected waves are proportional to the square of the voltage components due to each wave, SWR can be expressed in terms of forward and reflected power:

:formula_19

By sampling the complex voltage and current at the point of insertion, an SWR meter is able to compute the effective forward and reflected voltages on the transmission line for the characteristic impedance for which the SWR meter has been designed. Since the forward and reflected power is related to the square of the forward and reflected voltages, some SWR meters also display the forward and reflected power.

In the special case of a load L, which is purely resistive but unequal to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line 0, the SWR is given simply by their ratio:

:formula_20

with the ratio or its reciprocal is chosen to obtain a value greater than unity.

==The standing wave pattern==
Using complex notation for the voltage amplitudes, for a signal at frequency , the actual (real) voltages V as a function of time are understood to relate to the complex voltages according to:

:formula_21 

Thus taking the real part of the complex quantity inside the parenthesis, the actual voltage consists of a sine wave at frequency with a peak amplitude equal to the complex magnitude of , and with a phase given by the phase of the complex . Then with the position along a transmission line given by , with the line ending in a load located at , the complex amplitudes of the forward and reverse waves would be written as:

:formula_22

for some complex amplitude (corresponding to the forward wave at that some treatments use phasors where the time dependence is according to formula_23 and spatial dependence (for a wave in the direction) of formula_24 Either convention obtains the same result for .

According to the superposition principle the net voltage present at any point on the transmission line is equal to the sum of the voltages due to the forward and reflected waves:

:formula_25

Since we are interested in the variations of the &quot;magnitude&quot; of along the line (as a function of ), we shall solve instead for the squared magnitude of that quantity, which simplifies the mathematics. To obtain the squared magnitude we multiply the above quantity by its complex conjugate:

:formula_26

Depending on the phase of the third term, the maximum and minimum values of (the square root of the quantity in the equations) are formula_27 and formula_28 respectively, for a standing wave ratio of:
:formula_29
:formula_30
as earlier asserted. Along the line, the above expression for formula_31 is seen to oscillate sinusoidally between formula_32 and formula_33 with a period of  . This is &quot;half&quot; of the guided wavelength for the frequency  . That can be seen as due to interference between two waves of that frequency which are travelling in &quot;opposite&quot; directions.

For example, at a frequency (free space wavelength of 15 m) in a transmission line whose velocity factor is 0.67 , the guided wavelength (distance between voltage peaks of the forward wave alone) would be At instances when the forward wave at is at zero phase (peak voltage) then at it would also be at zero phase, but at it would be at 180° phase (peak &quot;negative&quot; voltage). On the other hand, the magnitude of the voltage due to a standing wave produced by its addition to a reflected wave, would have a wavelength between peaks of only Depending on the location of the load and phase of reflection, there might be a peak in the magnitude of at Then there would be another peak found where at whereas it would find minima of the standing wave at 8.8 m, etc.

==Practical implications of SWR==

The most common case for measuring and examining SWR is when installing and tuning transmitting antennas. When a transmitter is connected to an antenna by a feed line, the driving point impedance of the antenna must match the characteristic impedance of the feed line in order for the transmitter to see the impedance it was designed for (the impedance of the feed line, usually 50 or 75 ohms).

The impedance of a particular antenna design can vary due to a number of factors that cannot always be clearly identified. This includes the transmitter frequency (as compared to the antenna&#x27;s design or resonant frequency), the antenna&#x27;s height above and quality of the ground, proximity to large metal structures, and variations in the exact size of the conductors used to construct the antenna.

When an antenna and feed line do not have matching impedances, the transmitter sees an unexpected impedance, where it might not be able to produce its full power, and can even damage the transmitter in some cases.
The reflected power in the transmission line increases the average current and therefore losses in the transmission line compared to power actually delivered to the load.
It is the interaction of these reflected waves with forward waves which causes standing wave patterns, with the negative repercussions we have noted.

Matching the impedance of the antenna to the impedance of the feed line can sometimes be accomplished through adjusting the antenna itself, but otherwise is possible using an antenna tuner, an impedance matching device. Installing the tuner between the feed line and the antenna allows for the feed line to see a load close to its characteristic impedance, while sending most of the transmitter&#x27;s power (a small amount may be dissipated within the tuner) to be radiated by the antenna despite its otherwise unacceptable feed point impedance. Installing a tuner in between the transmitter and the feed line can also transform the impedance seen at the transmitter end of the feed line to one preferred by the transmitter. However, in the latter case, the feed line still has a high SWR present, with the resulting increased feed line losses unmitigated.

The magnitude of those losses are dependent on the type of transmission line, and its length. They always increase with frequency. For example, a certain antenna used well away from its resonant frequency may have an SWR of 6:1. For a frequency of 3.5 MHz, with that antenna fed through 75 meters of RG-8A coax, the loss due to standing waves would be 2.2 dB. However the same 6:1 mismatch through 75 meters of RG-8A coax would incur 10.8 dB of loss at 146 MHz. Thus, a better match of the antenna to the feed line, that is, a lower SWR, becomes increasingly important with increasing frequency, even if the transmitter is able to accommodate the impedance seen (or an antenna tuner is used between the transmitter and feed line).

Certain types of transmissions can suffer other negative effects from reflected waves on a transmission line. Analog TV can experience &quot;ghosts&quot; from delayed signals bouncing back and forth on a long line. FM stereo can also be affected and digital signals can experience delayed pulses leading to bit errors. Whenever the delay times for a signal going back down and then again up the line are comparable to the modulation time constants, effects occur. For this reason, these types of transmissions require a low SWR on the feedline, even if SWR induced loss might be acceptable and matching is done at the transmitter.

==Methods of measuring standing wave ratio==
Many different methods can be used to measure standing wave ratio. The most intuitive method uses a slotted line which is a section of transmission line with an open slot which allows a probe to detect the actual voltage at various points along the line.
Thus the maximum and minimum values can be compared directly. This method is used at VHF and higher frequencies. At lower frequencies, such lines are impractically long.

Directional couplers can be used at HF through microwave frequencies. Some are a quarter wave or more long, which restricts their use to the higher frequencies. Other types of directional couplers sample the current and voltage at a single point in the transmission path and mathematically combine them in such a way as to represent the power flowing in one direction.
The common type of SWR / power meter used in amateur operation may contain a dual directional coupler. Other types use a single coupler which can be rotated 180 degrees to sample power flowing in either direction. Unidirectional couplers of this type are available for many frequency ranges and power levels and with appropriate coupling values for the analog meter used.

The forward and reflected power measured by directional couplers can be used to calculate SWR. The computations can be done mathematically in analog or digital form or by using graphical methods built into the meter as an additional scale or by reading from the crossing point between two needles on the same meter. 
The above measuring instruments can be used &quot;in line&quot; that is, the full power of the transmitter can pass through the measuring device so as to allow continuous monitoring of SWR. Other instruments, such as network analyzers, low power directional couplers and antenna bridges use low power for the measurement and must be connected in place of the transmitter. Bridge circuits can be used to directly measure the real and imaginary parts of a load impedance and to use those values to derive SWR. These methods can provide more information than just SWR or forward and reflected power.
Stand alone antenna analyzers use various measuring methods and can display SWR and other parameters plotted against frequency. By using directional couplers and a bridge in combination, it is possible to make an in line instrument that reads directly in complex impedance or in SWR.
Stand alone antenna analyzers also are available that measure multiple parameters.

==Power standing wave ratio==

The term &quot;power standing wave ratio&quot; (PSWR) is sometimes referred to, and defined as, the square of the voltage standing wave ratio. The term is widely cited as &quot;misleading&quot;.
However it does correspond to one type of measurement of SWR using what was formerly a standard measuring instrument at microwave frequencies, the slotted line. The slotted line is a waveguide (or air-filled coaxial line) in which a small sensing antenna which is part of a &quot;crystal detector&quot; or &quot;detector&quot; is placed in the electric field in the line. The voltage induced in the antenna is rectified by either a point contact diode (crystal rectifier) or a Schottky barrier diode that is incorporated in the detector. These detectors have a square law output for low levels of input. Readings therefore corresponded to the square of the electric field along the slot, &quot;E&quot;2(&quot;x&quot;), with maximum and minimum readings of &quot;E&quot;2max and &quot;E&quot;2min found as the probe is moved along the slot. The ratio of these yields the &quot;square&quot; of the SWR, the so-called PSWR.

This technique of rationalization of terms is fraught with problems. The square law behavior of the detector diode is exhibited only when the voltage across the diode is below the knee of the diode. Once the detected voltage exceeds the knee, the response of the diode becomes nearly linear. In this mode the diode and its associated filtering capacitor produce a voltage that is proportional to the peak of the sampled voltage. The operator of such a detector would not have a ready indication as to the mode in which the detector diode is operating and therefore differentiating the results between SWR or so called PSWR is not practical. Perhaps even worse, is the common case where the minimum detected voltage is below the knee and the maximum voltage is above the knee. In this case, the computed results are largely meaningless. Thus the terms PSWR and Power Standing Wave Ratio are deprecated and should be considered only from a legacy measurement perspective.

==Implications of SWR on medical applications==

SWR can also have a detrimental impact upon the performance of microwave-based medical applications. In microwave electrosurgery an antenna that is placed directly into tissue may not always have an optimal match with the feedline resulting in an SWR. The presence of SWR can affect monitoring components used to measure power levels impacting the reliability of such measurements.

<text>A star coupler is a device that takes in an input signal and splits it into several output signals.

In fiber optics, and especially in telecommunications, a star coupler is a passive optical device, used in network applications. An optical signal introduced into any input port is distributed to all output ports. Because of the way a passive star coupler is constructed, the number of ports is usually a power of 2; i.e., two input ports and two output ports (a &quot;two-port&quot; coupler, customarily called a &quot;directional coupler,&quot; or &quot;splitter&quot;); four input ports and four output ports (a &quot;four-port&quot; coupler); eight input ports and eight output ports (an &quot;eight-port&quot; coupler), etc.

Digital Equipment Corporation (now part of Hewlett-Packard) of Maynard, Massachusetts sold a star coupler that interconnected links to computers via coaxial cable rather than optical fibres, but the function was essentially the same. The signal that was distributed was 70 Mbit/s computer interconnect (CI) data and the star coupler provided two redundant paths of either 8 or 16 ports each. Digital&#x27;s star coupler was developed for use with the VAX- and later Alpha-based computers running Digital&#x27;s OpenVMS operating system, to provide a passive, highly reliable interconnect for Digital&#x27;s cluster technology.

<text>In telecommunications, a start signal is a signal that prepares a device to receive data or to perform a function. 

In asynchronous serial communication, start signals are used at the beginning of a character that prepares the receiving device for the reception of the code elements. 

A start signal is limited to one signal element usually having the duration of a unit interval.

<doc id="41748" wikidata="Q7607955" url="?curid=41748" title="Step-index profile">
<text>For an optical fiber, a step-index profile is a refractive index profile characterized by a uniform refractive index within the core and a sharp decrease in refractive index at the core-cladding so that the cladding is of a lower refractive index. The step-index profile corresponds to a power-law index profile with the profile parameter approaching infinity. The step-index profile is used in most single-mode fibers and some multimode fibers.

A step-index fiber is characterized by the core and cladding refractive indices &quot;n1&quot; and &quot;n2&quot; and the core and cladding radii a and b. Examples of standard core and cladding diameters 2a/2b are 8/125, 50/125, 62.5/125, 85/125, or 100/140 (units of μm). The fractional refractive-index change formula_1. The value of n1 is typically between 1.44 and 1.46, and formula_2 is typically between 0.001 and 0.02.

Step-index optical fiber is generally made by doping high-purity fused silica glass (SiO2) with different concentrations of materials like titanium, germanium, or boron.
Modal dispersion in a step index optical fiber is given by

formula_3

where
:formula_4 is the fractional index of refraction
:formula_5 is the refractive index of core
:formula_6 is the length of the optical fiber under observation
:formula_7 is the speed of light.

<doc id="41749" wikidata="Q1971063" url="?curid=41749" title="Stopband">
<text>A stopband is a band of frequencies, between specified limits, through which a circuit, such as a filter or telephone circuit, does not allow signals to pass, or the attenuation is above the required stopband attenuation level. Depending on application, the required attenuation within the stopband may typically be a value between 20 and 120 dB higher than the nominal passband attenuation, which often is 0 dB.

The lower and upper &quot;limiting frequencies&quot;, also denoted lower and upper stopband corner frequencies, are the frequencies where the stopband and the transition bands meet in a filter specification. The stopband of a low-pass filter is the frequencies from the stopband corner frequency (which is slightly higher than the passband 3 dB cut-off frequency) up to the infinite frequency. The stopband of a high-pass filter consists of the frequencies from 0 hertz to a stopband corner frequency (slightly lower than the passband cut-off frequency).

A band-stop filter has one stopband, specified by two non-zero and non-infinite corner frequencies. The difference between the limits in the band-stop filter is the stopband bandwidth, which usually is expressed in hertz.

A bandpass filter typically has two stopbands. The shape factor of a bandpass filter is the relationship between the 3 dB bandwidth, and the difference between the stopband limits.

#subtracting the power level obtained at the output of the fiber under test from the power level obtained at the output of the reference fiber, to get the transmission loss of the fiber under test. 

The substitution method has certain shortcomings with regard to its accuracy, but its simplicity makes it a popular field test method. It is conservative, in that if it were used to measure the individual losses of several long fibers, and the long fibers were concatenated, the total loss obtained (excluding splice losses) would be expected to be lower than the sum of the individual fiber losses. 

Some modern optical power meters have the capability to set to zero the reference level measured at the output of the reference fiber, so that the transmission loss of the fiber under test may be read out directly.

<text>Reduced-carrier transmission is an amplitude modulation (AM) transmission in which the carrier signal level is reduced to reduce wasted electrical power. Suppressed-carrier transmission is a special case in which the carrier level is reduced below that required for demodulation by a normal receiver.

Reduction of the carrier level permits higher power levels in the sidebands than would be possible with conventional AM transmission. Carrier power must be restored by the receiving station to permit demodulation, usually by means of a beat frequency oscillator (BFO). Failure of the BFO to match the original carrier frequency when receiving such a signal will cause a heterodyne.

Suppressed carriers are often used for single sideband (SSB) transmissions, such as for amateur radio on shortwave. That system is referred to in full as SSB suppressed carrier (SSBSC) or (SSB-SC). International broadcasters agreed in 1985 to also use SSBSC entirely by 2015, though IBOC and IBAC digital radio (namely Digital Radio Mondiale) seems likely to make this irrelevant.

FM stereo transmissions use a double-sideband suppressed carrier (DSBSC) signal from a stereo generator, together with a pilot tone of exactly half the original carrier frequency. This allows reconstitution of the original stereo carrier, and hence the stereo signal.

<doc id="41763" wikidata="Q889796" url="?curid=41763" title="Surface wave">
<text>In physics, a surface wave is a mechanical wave that propagates along the interface between differing media. A common example is gravity waves along the surface of liquids, such as ocean waves. Gravity waves can also occur within liquids, at the interface between two fluids with different densities. Elastic surface waves can travel along the surface of solids, such as &quot;Rayleigh&quot; or &quot;Love&quot; waves. Electromagnetic waves can also propagate as &quot;surface waves&quot; in that they can be guided along with a refractive index gradient or along an interface between two media having different dielectric constants. In radio transmission, a &quot;ground wave&quot; is a guided wave that propagates close to the surface of the Earth.

==Mechanical waves==
In seismology, several types of surface waves are encountered. Surface waves, in this mechanical sense, are commonly known as either &quot;Love waves&quot; (L waves) or &quot;Rayleigh waves&quot;. A seismic wave is a wave that &quot;travels through the Earth, often as the result of an earthquake or explosion.&quot; Love waves have transverse motion (movement is perpendicular to the direction of travel, like light waves), whereas Rayleigh waves have both longitudinal (movement parallel to the direction of travel, like sound waves) and transverse motion. Seismic waves are studied by seismologists and measured by a seismograph or seismometer. Surface waves span a wide frequency range, and the period of waves that are most damaging is usually 10 seconds or longer. Surface waves can travel around the globe many times from the largest earthquakes. Surface waves are caused when P waves and S waves come to the surface.

Examples are the waves at the surface of water and air (ocean surface waves). Another example is internal waves, which can be transmitted along the interface of two water masses of different densities.

In theory of hearing physiology, the traveling wave (TW) of Von Bekesy, resulted from an acoustic surface wave of the basilar membrane into the cochlear duct. His theory purported to explain every feature of the auditory sensation owing to these passive mechanical phenomena. Jozef Zwislocki, and later David Kemp, showed that that is unrealistic and that active feedback is necessary.

==Electromagnetic waves==
&quot;Ground waves&quot; are radio waves propagating parallel to and adjacent to the surface of the Earth, following the curvature of the Earth. This radiative ground wave is known as Norton surface wave, or more properly Norton ground wave, because ground waves in radio propagation are not confined to the surface.

Another type of surface wave is the non-radiative, bound-mode &quot;Zenneck surface wave&quot; or &quot;Zenneck–Sommerfeld surface wave&quot;. The earth has one refractive index and the atmosphere has another, thus constituting an interface that supports the guided Zenneck wave&#x27;s transmission. Other types of surface wave are the trapped surface wave, the gliding wave and Dyakonov surface waves (DSW) propagating at the interface of transparent materials with different symmetry. Apart from these, various types of surface waves have been studied for optical wavelengths.

===Microwave field theory===
Within microwave field theory, the interface of a dielectric and conductor supports &quot;surface wave transmission&quot;. Surface waves have been studied as part of transmission lines and some may be considered as single-wire transmission lines.

Characteristics and utilizations of the electrical surface wave phenomenon include:
* The field components of the wave diminish with distance from the interface.
* Electromagnetic energy is not converted from the surface wave field to another form of energy (except in leaky or lossy surface waves) such that the wave does not transmit power normal to the interface, i.e. it is evanescent along that dimension. 
* In coaxial cable in addition to the TEM mode there also exists a transverse-magnetic (TM) mode which propagates as a surface wave in the region around the central conductor. For coax of common impedance this mode is effectively suppressed but in high impedance coax and on a single central conductor without any outer shield, low attenuation and very broadband propagation is supported. Transmission line operation in this mode is called E-Line.

===Surface plasmon polariton===

The surface plasmon polariton (SPP) is an electromagnetic surface wave that can travel along an interface between two media with different dielectric constants. It exists under the condition that the permittivity of one of the materials forming the interface is negative, while the other one is positive, as is the case for the interface between air and a lossy conducting medium below the plasma frequency. The wave propagates parallel to the interface and decays exponentially vertical to it, a property called evanescence. Since the wave is on the boundary of a lossy conductor and a second medium, these oscillations can be sensitive to changes to the boundary, such as the adsorption of molecules by the conducting surface.

===Sommerfeld–Zenneck surface wave===

The Sommerfeld–Zenneck wave or Zenneck wave is a non-radiative guided electromagnetic wave that is supported by a planar or spherical interface between two homogeneous media having different dielectric constants. This surface wave propagates parallel to the interface and decays exponentially vertical to it, a property known as evanescence. It exists under the condition that the permittivity of one of the materials forming the interface is negative, while the other one is positive, as for example the interface between air and a lossy conducting medium such as the terrestrial transmission line, below the plasma frequency. Its electric field strength falls off at a rate of e-αd/√d in the direction of propagation along the interface due to two-dimensional geometrical field spreading at a rate of 1/√d, in combination with a frequency-dependent exponential attenuation (α), which is the terrestrial transmission line dissipation, where α depends on the medium’s conductivity. Arising from original analysis by Arnold Sommerfeld and Jonathan Zenneck of the problem of wave propagation over a lossy earth, it exists as an exact solution to Maxwell&#x27;s equations. The Zenneck surface wave, which is a non-radiating guided-wave mode, can be derived by employing the Hankel transform of a radial ground current associated with a realistic terrestrial Zenneck surface wave source. Sommerfeld-Zenneck surface waves predict that the energy decays as R−1 because the energy distributes over the circumference of a circle and not the surface of a sphere. Evidence does not show that in radio space wave propagation, Sommerfeld-Zenneck surfaces waves are a mode of propagation as the path-loss exponent is generally between 20 dB/dec and 40 dB/dec.

<text>Survivability is the ability to remain alive or continue to exist. The term has more specific meaning in certain contexts.

==Ecological==
Following disruptive forces such as flood, fire, disease, war, or climate change some species of flora, fauna, and local life forms are likely to survive more successfully than others because of consequent changes to their surrounding biophysical conditions.

==Engineering==
In engineering, survivability is the quantified ability of a system, subsystem, equipment, process, or procedure to continue to function during and after a natural or man-made disturbance; for example a nuclear electromagnetic pulse from the detonation of a nuclear weapon.

For a given application, survivability must be qualified by specifying the range of conditions over which the entity will survive, the minimum acceptable level or post-disturbance functionality, and the maximum acceptable downtime.

==Military==

In the military environment, survivability can be defined as the ability to remain mission capable after a single engagement. Engineers working in survivability are often responsible for improving four main system elements:

* Detectability - the inability to &quot;avoid&quot; being aurally and visually detected as well as detected by radar (by an observer).
* Susceptibility - the inability to &quot;avoid&quot; being hit (by a weapon).
* Vulnerability - the inability to &quot;withstand&quot; the hit.
* Recoverability - longer-term post-hit effects, damage control, and firefighting, &quot;capability restoration&quot;, or (in extremis) escape and evacuation.

The European Survivability Workshop introduced the concept of &quot;Mission Survivability&quot; whilst retaining the three core areas above, either pertaining to the &quot;survivability&quot; of a platform through a complete mission, or the &quot;survivability&quot; of the mission itself (i.e. probability of mission success). Recent studies have also introduced the concept of &quot;Force Survivability&quot; which relates to the ability of a force rather than an individual platform to remain &quot;mission capable&quot;.

There is no clear prioritisation of the three elements; this will depend on the characteristics and role of the platform. Some platform types, such as submarines and airplanes, minimise their susceptibility and may, to some extent, compromise in the other areas. Main Battle Tanks minimise vulnerability through the use of heavy armours. Present day surface warship designs tend to aim for a balanced combination of all three areas.

A popular term is the &quot;survivability onion&quot;; described as 5-8 layers: 
Don&#x27;t be there. If you are there, don’t be seen. If you are seen, don’t be targeted/acquired. If you are targeted/acquired, don’t be hit. If you are hit, don’t be penetrated. If you are penetrated, don’t be killed.

=== Naval ===
Survivability denotes the ability of a ship and its on-board systems to remain functional and continue designated mission in a man-made hostile environment. The naval vessels are designed to operate in a man-made hostile environment, and therefore the survivability is a vital feature required from them. The naval vessel&#x27;s survivability is a complicated subject affecting the whole life cycle of the vessel, and should be considered from the initial design phase of every war ship.

The classical definition of naval survivability includes three main aspects, which are susceptibility, vulnerability, and recoverability; although, recoverability is often subsumed within vulnerability.
Susceptibility consists of all the factors that expose the ship to the weapons effects in a combat environment. These factors in general are the operating conditions, the threat, and the features of the ship itself. The operating conditions, such as sea state, weather and atmospheric conditions, vary considerably, and their influence is difficult to address (hence they are often not accounted for in survivability assessment). The threat is dependent on the weapons directed against the ship and weapon&#x27;s performance, such as the range. The features of the ship in this sense include platform signatures (radar, infrared, acoustic, magnetic), the defensive systems on board, such as surface-to-air missiles, EW and decoys, and also the tactics employed by the platform in countering the attack (aspects such as speed, maneuverability, chosen aspect presented to the threat).
Vulnerability refers to the ability of the vessel to withstand the short-term effects of the threat weapon. Vulnerability is an attribute typical to the vessel and therefore heavily
affected by the vessel&#x27;s basic characteristics such as size, subdivision, armouring, and other hardening features, and also the design of the ship&#x27;s systems, in particular the location of equipment, degrees of redundancy and separation, and the presence within a system of single point failures. Recoverability refers to vessel&#x27;s ability to restore and maintain its functionality after sustaining damage. Thus, recoverability is dependent on the actions aimed to neutralize the effects of the damage. These actions include firefighting, limiting the extent of flooding, and dewatering. Besides the equipment, the crew also has a vital role in recoverability.

=== Combat vehicle crew ===

The crews of military combat vehicles face numerous lethal hazards which are both diverse and constantly evolving. Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), mines, and enemy fire are examples of such persistent and variable threats. Historically, measures taken to mitigate these hazards were concerned with protecting the vehicle itself, but due to this achieving only limited protection, the focus has now shifted to safeguarding the crew within from an ever-broadening range of threats, including Radio Controlled IEDs (RCIEDs), blast, fragmentation, heat stress, and dehydration.

The expressed goal of &quot;crew survivability&quot; is to ensure vehicle occupants are best protected. It goes beyond simply ensuring crew have the appropriate protective equipment and has expanded to include measuring the overpressure and blunt impact forces experienced by a vehicle from real blast incidents in order to develop medical treatment and improve overall crew survivability. Sustainable crew survivability is dependent on the effective integration of knowledge, training, and equipment.

==== Prevention and training ====
Threat intelligence identifying trends, emerging technologies, and attack tactics used by enemy forces enables crews to implement procedures that will reduce their exposure to unnecessary risks. Such intelligence also allows for more effective pre-deployment training programs where personnel can be taught the most up-to-date developments in IED concealment, for example, or undertake tailored training that will enable them to identify the likely attack strategy of enemy forces. In addition, with expert, current threat intelligence, the most effective equipment can be procured or rapidly developed in support of operations.

==Network==

===Definitions of network survivability===
&quot;The capability of a system to fulfill its mission, in a timely manner, in the presence of such as attacks or large-scale natural disasters. Survivability is a subset of resilience.&quot;

“The capability of a system to fulfill its mission, in a timely manner, in the presence of attacks, failures, or accidents.”

<doc id="41770" wikidata="Q940979" url="?curid=41770" title="Synchronous orbit">
<text>A synchronous orbit is an orbit in which an orbiting body (usually a satellite) has a period equal to the average rotational period of the body being orbited (usually a planet), and in the same direction of rotation as that body.

== Simplified meaning ==
A synchronous orbit is an orbit in which the orbiting object (for example, an artificial satellite or a moon) takes the same amount of time to complete an orbit as it takes the object it is orbiting to rotate once.

== Properties ==
A satellite in a synchronous orbit that is both equatorial and circular will appear to be suspended motionless above a point on the orbited planet&#x27;s equator. For synchronous satellites orbiting Earth, this is also known as a geostationary orbit. However, a synchronous orbit need not be equatorial; nor circular. A body in a non-equatorial synchronous orbit will appear to oscillate north and south above a point on the planet&#x27;s equator, whereas a body in an elliptical orbit will appear to oscillate eastward and westward. As seen from the orbited body the combination of these two motions produces a figure-8 pattern called an analemma.

== Nomenclature ==
There are many specialized terms for synchronous orbits depending on the body orbited. The following are some of the more common ones. A synchronous orbit around Earth that is circular and lies in the equatorial plane is called a geostationary orbit. The more general case, when the orbit is inclined to Earth&#x27;s equator or is non-circular is called a geosynchronous orbit. The corresponding terms for synchronous orbits around Mars are areostationary and areosynchronous orbits. 

== Formula ==

For a stationary synchronous orbit:

: formula_1
: G = Gravitational constant
: m2 = Mass of the celestial body
: T = rotational period of the body
:formula_2 = Radius of orbit

By this formula one can find the stationary orbit of an object in relation to a given body.

Orbital speed (how fast a satellite is moving through space) is calculated by multiplying the angular speed of the satellite by the orbital radius.

== Examples ==
An astronomical example is Pluto&#x27;s largest moon Charon.
Much more commonly, synchronous orbits are employed by artificial satellites used for communication, such as geostationary satellites.

For natural satellites, which can attain a synchronous orbit only by tidally locking their parent body, it always goes in hand with synchronous rotation of the satellite. This is because the smaller body becomes tidally locked faster, and by the time a synchronous orbit is achieved, it has had a locked synchronous rotation for a long time already.

<text>The basic study of system design is the understanding of component parts and their subsequent interaction with one another.

Systems design has appeared in a variety of fields, including sustainability, computer/software architecture, and sociology.

== Product Development ==
If the broader topic of product development &quot;blends the perspective of marketing, design, and manufacturing into a single approach to product development,&quot; then design is the act of taking the marketing information and creating the design of the product to be manufactured. 

Thus in product development, systems design involves the process of defining and developing systems, such as interfaces and data, for an electronic control system to satisfy specified requirements. Systems design could be seen as the application of systems theory to product development. There is some overlap with the disciplines of systems analysis, systems architecture and systems engineering.

===Physical design ===
The physical design relates to the actual input and output processes of the system. This is explained in terms of how data is input into a system, how it is verified/authenticated, how it is processed, and how it is displayed.
In physical design, the following requirements about the system are decided.
# Input requirement, 
# Output requirements,
# Storage requirements,
# Processing requirements,
# System control and backup or recovery.

Put another way, the physical portion of system design can generally be broken down into three sub-tasks:
# User Interface Design
# Data Design
# Process Design

===Architecture design===
Designing the overall structure of a system focuses on creating a scalable, reliable, and efficient system. For example, services like Google, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix exemplify large-scale distributed systems. Here are key considerations:
# Functional and non-functional requirements
# Capacity estimation
# Usage of relational and/or NoSQL databases
# Vertical scaling, horizontal scaling, sharding
# Load balancing
# Primary-secondary replication
# Cache and CDN
# Stateless and Stateful servers
# Datacenter georouting
# Message Queue, Publish-Subscribe Architecture
# Performance Metrics Monitoring and Logging
# Build, test, configure deploy automation
# Finding single point of failure
# API Rate Limiting
# Service Level Agreement

===Machine Learning Systems Design===
Machine learning systems design focuses on building scalable, reliable, and efficient systems that integrate machine learning (ML) models to solve real-world problems. ML systems require careful consideration of data pipelines, model training, and deployment infrastructure. ML systems are often used in applications such as recommendation engines, fraud detection, and natural language processing.

Key components to consider when designing ML systems include:
# Problem Definition: Clearly define the problem, data requirements, and evaluation metrics. Success criteria often involve accuracy, latency, and scalability.
# Data Pipeline: Build automated pipelines to collect, clean, transform, and validate data.
# Model Selection and Training: Choose appropriate algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, neural networks) and train models using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
# Deployment and Serving: Deploy trained models to production environments using scalable architectures such as containerized services (e.g., Docker and Kubernetes).
# Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor model performance, retrain as necessary, and ensure data drift is addressed.

Designing an ML system involves balancing trade-offs between accuracy, latency, cost, and maintainability, while ensuring system scalability and reliability. The discipline overlaps with MLOps, a set of practices that unifies machine learning development and operations to ensure smooth deployment and lifecycle management of ML systems.

<doc id="41775" wikidata="Q5408491" url="?curid=41775" title="Tactical communications">
<text>Tactical communications are military communications in which information of any kind, especially orders and military intelligence, are conveyed from one command, person, or place to another upon a battlefield, particularly during the conduct of combat. It includes any kind of delivery of information, whether verbal, written, visual or auditory, and can be sent in a variety of ways. In modern times, this is usually done by electronic means. Tactical communications do not include communications provided to tactical forces by the Defense Communications System to non-tactical military commands, to tactical forces by civil organizations, nor does it include strategic communication.

== Early means ==
The earliest way of communicating with others in a battle was by the commander&#x27;s voice or by human messenger. A runner would carry reports or orders from one officer to another. Once the horse was domesticated messages could travel much faster. A very fast way to send information was to use either drums, trumpets or flags. Each sound or banner would have a pre-determined significance for the soldier who would respond accordingly. Auditory signals were only as effective, though, as the receiver&#x27;s ability to hear them. The din of battle or long distances could make using noise less effective. They were also limited in the amount of information they could convey; the information must be simple, such as &quot;attack&quot; or &quot;retreat&quot;.

Visual cues, such as flags or smoke signals required the receiver to have a clear line of sight to the signal, and know when and where to look for them. Intricate warning systems have though always been used such as scouting towers with fires to signal incoming threats - this could occur at the tactical as well as the strategic level. The armies of the 19th century used two flags in combinations that replicated the alphabet. This allowed commanders the ability to send any order they wanted as they needed to, but still relied on line-of-sight. During the Siege of Paris (1870–71) the defending French effectively used carrier pigeons to relay information between tactical units.

== The wireless revolution ==
Although visual communication flew at the speed of light, it relied on a direct line of sight between the sender and the receiver. Telegraphs helped theater commanders to move large armies about, but one certainly could not count on using immobile telegraph lines on a changing battlefield. 

At the end of the 19th century the disparate units across any field were instantaneously joined to their commanders by the invention and mass production of the radio. At first the radio could only broadcast tones, so messages were sent via Morse code. The first field radios used by the United States Army saw action in the Spanish–American War (1898) and the Philippine Insurrection (1899–1902). At the same time as radios were deployed the field telephone was developed and made commercially viable. This caused a new signal occupation specialty to be developed: lineman.

During the Interwar period the German army invented Blitzkrieg in which air, armor, and infantry forces acted swiftly and precisely, with constant radio communication. They triumphed until their enemies equipped themselves to communicate and coordinate similarly.

== The digital battlefield ==
Security was a problem. If you broadcast your plans over radio waves, anyone with a similar radio listening to the same frequency could hear your plans. Trench codes became the tactical part of World War I cryptography. Advances in electronics, particularly after World War II, allowed for electronic scrambling of voice radio. Operational and strategic messages during the war were by text were encrypted with ciphers too complex for humans to crack without the assistance of a similar, high-tech machine, such as the German Enigma machine. Once computer science advanced, tactical voice radio could be encrypted, and large amounts of data could be sent over the airwaves in quick bursts of signals with more complex encryption. 

Communication between armies were of course much more difficult before the electronic age and could only be achieved with messengers on horseback or by foot and with time delays according to the distance the messenger needed to travel. Advances in long-range communications aided the commander on the battlefield, for then they could receive news of any outside force or factor that could impact the conduct of a battle.

<text>A tape relay is a method of retransmitting teletypewriter traffic from one communication channel to another, in which messages arriving on an incoming channel are recorded in the form of perforated tape, this punched tape then being either fed directly and automatically into an outgoing channel, or manually transferred to an automatic transmitter for transmission on an outgoing channel. Tape relay, sometimes informally called &quot;torn tape operation&quot;, was commonplace during much of the 20th century.

The first version, the Transmission System 1 (T1), was introduced in 1962 in the Bell System, and could transmit up to 24 telephone calls simultaneously over a single transmission line of copper wire. Subsequent specifications carried multiples of the basic T1 (1.544 Mbit/s) data rates, such as T2 (6.312 Mbit/s) with 96 channels, T3 (44.736 Mbit/s) with 672 channels, and others.

Although a &quot;T2&quot; was defined as part of AT&amp;T&#x27;s T-carrier system, which defined five levels, T1 through T5, only the T1 and T3 were commonly in use.

==Transmission System 1==
The T-carrier is a hardware specification for carrying multiple time-division multiplexed (TDM) telecommunications channels over a single four-wire transmission circuit. It was developed by AT&amp;T at Bell Laboratories ca. 1957 and first employed by 1962 for long-haul pulse-code modulation (PCM) digital voice transmission with the D1 channel bank.

The T-carriers are commonly used for trunking between switching centers in a telephone network, including to private branch exchange (PBX) interconnect points. It uses the same twisted pair copper wire that analog trunks used, employing one pair for transmitting, and another pair for receiving. Signal repeaters may be used for extended distance requirements.

Before the digital T-carrier system, carrier wave systems such as 12-channel carrier systems worked by frequency-division multiplexing; each call was an analog signal. A T1 trunk could transmit 24 telephone calls at a time, because it used a digital carrier signal called Digital Signal 1 (DS-1). DS-1 is a communications protocol for multiplexing the bitstreams of up to 24 telephone calls, along with two special bits: a &quot;framing bit&quot; (for frame synchronization) and a &quot;maintenance-signaling bit&quot;. T1&#x27;s maximum data transmission rate is 1.544 megabits per second.

Outside of the United States, Canada, Japan, and South Korea, the E-carrier system is used. E-carrier is similar transmission system with higher capacity that is not directly compatible with the T-carrier.

==Legacy==
Existing frequency-division multiplexing carrier systems worked well for connections between distant cities, but required expensive modulators, demodulators and filters for every voice channel. In the late 1950s, Bell Labs sought cheaper terminal equipment for connections within metropolitan areas. Pulse-code modulation allowed sharing a coder and decoder among several voice trunks, so this method was chosen for the T1 system introduced into local use in 1961. In later decades, the cost of digital electronics declined to the point that an individual codec per voice channel became commonplace, but by then the other advantages of digital transmission had become entrenched.

The T1 format carried 24 pulse-code modulated, time-division multiplexed speech signals each encoded in 64 kbit/s streams, leaving 8 kbit/s of framing information which facilitates the synchronization and demultiplexing at the receiver. The T2 and T3 circuit channels carry multiple T1 channels multiplexed, resulting in transmission rates of 6.312 and 44.736 Mbit/s, respectively. A T3 line comprises 28 T1 lines, each operating at total signaling rate of 1.544 Mbit/s. It is possible to get a fractional T3 line, meaning a T3 line with some of the 28 lines turned off, resulting in a slower transfer rate but typically at reduced cost.

Supposedly, the 1.544 Mbit/s rate was chosen because tests by AT&amp;T Long Lines in Chicago were conducted underground. The test site was typical of Bell System outside plant of the time in that, to accommodate loading coils, cable vault manholes were physically apart, which determined the repeater spacing. The optimum bit rate was chosen empirically—the capacity was increased until the failure rate was unacceptable, then reduced to leave a margin. Companding allowed acceptable audio performance with only seven bits per PCM sample in this original T1/D1 system. The later D3 and D4 channel banks had an extended frame format, allowing eight bits per sample, reduced to seven every sixth sample or frame when one bit was &quot;robbed&quot; for signaling the state of the channel. The standard does not allow an all zero sample which would produce a long string of binary zeros and cause the repeaters to lose bit sync. However, when carrying data (Switched 56) there could be long strings of zeros, so one bit per sample is set to &quot;1&quot; (jam bit 7) leaving 7 bits × 8,000 frames per second for data.

A more detailed understanding of the development of the 1.544 Mbit/s rate and its division into channels is as follows. Given that the telephone system nominal voiceband (including guardband) is 4,000 Hz, the required digital sampling rate is 8,000 Hz (see Nyquist rate). Since each T1 frame contains 1 byte of voice data for each of the 24 channels, that system needs then 8,000 frames per second to maintain those 24 simultaneous voice channels. Because each frame of a T1 is 193 bits in length (24 channels × 8 bits per channel + 1 framing bit = 193 bits), 8,000 frames per second is multiplied by 193 bits to yield a transfer rate of 1.544 Mbit/s (8,000 × 193 = 1,544,000).

Initially, T1 used Alternate Mark Inversion (AMI) to reduce frequency bandwidth and eliminate the DC component of the signal. Later B8ZS became common practice. For AMI, each mark pulse had the opposite polarity of the previous one and each space was at a level of zero, resulting in a three level signal which carried only binary data. Similar 1970s British 23 channel systems at 1.536 megabaud were equipped with ternary signal repeaters, in anticipation of using a 3B2T or 4B3T code to increase the number of voice channels in the future. But in the 1980s, the systems were merely replaced with European standard ones. American T-carriers could only work in AMI or B8ZS mode.

The AMI or B8ZS signal allowed a simple error rate measurement. The D bank in the central office could detect a bit with the wrong polarity, or &quot;bipolarity violation&quot; and sound an alarm. Later systems could count the number of violations and reframes and otherwise measure signal quality and allow a more sophisticated alarm indication signal system.

The decision to use a 193-bit frame was made in 1958. To allow for the identification of information bits within a frame, two alternatives were considered. Assign (a) just one extra bit, or (b) additional eight bits per frame. The 8-bit choice is cleaner, resulting in a 200-bit frame, twenty-five 8-bit channels, of which 24 are traffic and one 8-bit channel available for operations, administration, and maintenance (OA&amp;M). AT&amp;T chose the single bit per frame not to reduce the required bit rate (1.544 vs 1.6 Mbit/s), but because AT&amp;T Marketing worried that &quot;if 8 bits were chosen for OA&amp;M function, someone would then try to sell this as a voice channel and you wind up with nothing.&quot;

Soon after commercial success of T1 in 1962, the T1 engineering team realized the mistake of having only one bit to serve the increasing demand for housekeeping functions. They petitioned AT&amp;T management to change to 8-bit framing. This was flatly turned down because it would make installed systems obsolete.

Having this hindsight, some ten years later, CEPT chose eight bits for framing the European E1, although, as feared, the extra channel is sometimes appropriated for voice or data.

==Higher bandwidth carriers==
In the 1970s, Bell Labs developed higher rate systems. T1C with a more sophisticated modulation scheme carried 3 Mbit/s, on those balanced pair cables that could support it. T-2 carried 6.312 Mbit/s, requiring a special low-capacitance cable with foam insulation. This was standard for Picturephone. T-4 and T-5 used coaxial cables, similar to the old L-carriers used by AT&amp;T Long Lines. TD microwave radio relay systems were also fitted with high rate modems to allow them to carry a DS1 signal in a portion of their FM spectrum that had too poor quality for voice service. Later they carried DS3 and DS4 signals. During the 1980s companies such as RLH Industries, Inc. developed T1 over optical fiber. The industry soon developed and evolved with multiplexed T1 transmission schemes.

==Digital signal cross-connect==
DS1 signals are interconnected typically at Central Office locations at a common metallic cross-connect point known as a DSX-1. When a DS1 is transported over metallic outside plant cable, the signal travels over conditioned cable pairs known as a T1 span. A T1 span can have up to +-130 Volts of DC power superimposed on the associated four wire cable pairs to supply power to line or &quot;Span&quot; signal repeaters, and T1 NIU&#x27;s (T1 Smartjacks). T1 span repeaters are typically engineered up to apart, depending on cable gauge, and at no more than 36 dB of loss before requiring a repeated span. There can be no cable bridge taps or Load Coils across any pairs.

T1 copper spans are being replaced by optical transport systems, but if a copper (Metallic) span is used, the T1 is typically carried over an HDSL encoded copper line. Four wire HDSL does not require as many repeaters as conventional T1 spans. Newer two wire HDSL (HDSL-2) equipment transports a full 1.544 Mbit/s T1 over a single copper wire pair up to approximately twelve thousand (12,000) feet (3.5 km), if all 24 gauge cable is used. HDSL-2 does not employ multiple repeaters as does conventional four wire HDSL, or newer HDSL-4 systems.

One advantage of HDSL is its ability to operate with a limited number of bridge taps, with no tap being closer than from any HDSL transceiver. Both two or four wire HDSL equipment transmits and receives over the same cable wire pair, as compared to conventional T1 service that utilizes individual cable pairs for transmit or receive.

DS3 signals are rare except within buildings, where they are used for interconnections and as an intermediate step before being multiplexed onto a SONET circuit. This is because a T3 circuit can only go about between repeaters. A customer who orders a DS3 usually receives a SONET circuit run into the building and a multiplexer mounted in a utility box. The DS3 is delivered in its familiar form, two coax cables (1 for send and 1 for receive) with BNC connectors on the ends.

== Bit robbing ==
Twelve DS1 frames make up a single T1 Superframe (T1 SF). Each T1 Superframe is composed of two signaling frames. All T1 DS0 channels that employ in-band signaling will have its eighth bit over written, or &quot;robbed&quot; from the full 64 kbit/s DS0 payload, by either a logical ZERO or ONE bit to signify a circuit signaling state or condition. Hence robbed bit signaling will restrict a DS0 channel to a rate of only 56 kbit/s during two of the twelve DS1 frames that make up a T1 SF framed circuit. T1 SF framed circuits yield two independent signaling channels (A and B) T1 ESF framed circuits four signaling frames in a twenty four frame extended frame format that yield four independent signaling channels (A, B, C, and D).

Fifty-six kbit/s DS0 channels are associated with digital data service (DDS) services typically do not utilize the eighth bit of the DS0 as voice circuits that employ A&amp;B out of band signaling. One exception is Switched 56 kbit/s DDS. In DDS, bit eight is used to identify DTE request to send (RTS) condition. With Switched 56 DDS, bit eight is pulsed (alternately set to logical ZERO and ONE) to transmit two state dial pulse signaling information between a SW56 DDS CSU/DSU, and a digital end office switch.

The use of robbed-bit signaling in America has decreased significantly as a result of Signaling System No 7 (SS7) on inter-office dial trunks. With SS7, the full 64 kbit/s DS0 channel is available for use on a connection, and allows 64 kbit/s, and 128 kbit/s ISDN data calls to exist over a switched trunk network connection if the supporting T1 carrier entity is optioned B8ZS (Clear Channel Capable).

== Carrier pricing ==
Carriers price DS1 lines in many different ways. However, most boil down to two simple components: local loop (the cost the local incumbent charges to transport the signal from the end user&#x27;s central office, otherwise known as a CO, to the point of presence, otherwise known as a POP, of the carrier) and the port (the cost to access the telephone network or the Internet through the carrier&#x27;s network). Typically, the port price is based upon access speed and yearly commitment level while the loop is based on geography. The farther the CO and POP, the more the loop costs.

The loop price has several components built into it, including the mileage calculation (performed in V/H coordinates, not standard GPS coordinates) and the telco piece. Each local Bell operating company—namely Verizon, AT&amp;T Inc., and Qwest—charge T-carriers different price per mile rates. Therefore, the price calculation has two distance steps: geomapping and the determination of local price arrangements.

While most carriers utilize a geographic pricing model as described above, some Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (CLECs), such as TelePacific, Integra Telecom, tw telecom, Windstream, Level 3 Communications, and XO Communications offer national pricing.

Under this DS1 pricing model, a provider charges the same price in every geography it services. National pricing is an outgrowth of increased competition in the T-carrier market space and the commoditization of T-carrier products. Providers that have adopted a national pricing strategy may experience widely varying margins as their suppliers, the Bell operating companies (e.g., Verizon, AT&amp;T Inc., and Qwest), maintain geographic pricing models, albeit at wholesale prices.

For voice DS1 lines, the calculation is mostly the same, except that the port (required for Internet access) is replaced by LDU (otherwise known as Long Distance Usage). Once the price of the loop is determined, only voice-related charges are added to the total. In short, the total price = loop + LDU x minutes used.

<text>A teleconference or telecon is a live exchange of information among several people remote from one another but linked by a communications system. Terms such as audio conferencing, telephone conferencing, and phone conferencing are also sometimes used to refer to teleconferencing.

The communications system may support the teleconference by providing one or more of the following: audio, video, and/or data services by one or more means, such as telephone, computer, telegraph, teletypewriter, radio, and television.

== Internet teleconferencing ==

Internet teleconferencing includes internet telephone conferencing, videotelephony, web conferencing, virtual workplace, and augmented reality conferencing.

Internet telephony involves conducting a teleconference over the Internet or a wide area network. One key technology in this area is Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP).

A working example of an augmented reality conferencing was demonstrated at the Salone di Mobile in Milano by AR+RFID Lab.

<text>A terminal adapter or TA is a device that connects a terminal device – a computer, a mobile communications device, or other – to a communications network.

== ISDN ==
In ISDN terminology, the &quot;terminal adapter&quot; connects a &quot;terminal&quot; (computer) to the ISDN network. The TA therefore fulfills a similar function to the ones a modem has on the POTS network, and is therefore sometimes called an ISDN modem. The latter term, however, is partially misleading as there is no modulation or demodulation performed.

There are devices on the market that combine the functions of an ISDN TA with those of a classical modem (with an ISDN line interface). These combined TA/modems permit connections from both ISDN and analog-line/modem counterparts. In addition, a TA may contain an interface and codec for one or more analog telephone lines (aka &quot;a/b line&quot;), allowing an existing POTS installation to be upgraded to ISDN without changing phones.

Terminal adapters typically connect to a basic rate interface (S0, sometimes also U0). On the &quot;terminal&quot; side, the most popular interfaces are RS-232 serial and USB; others like V.35 or RS-449 are only of historical interest.

Devices connecting ISDN to a network (e.g. Ethernet) commonly include routing functionality; while they technically include a TA function, they are referred to as (ISDN) routers.

==Mobile networks==
In mobile networks, the &quot;terminal adapter&quot; is used by the terminal equipment to access the mobile termination, using AT commands (see Hayes command set).

In 2G (such as GSM or CDMA), the terminal adapter is a theoretically optional while in 3G (such as W-CDMA), the terminal adapter is mandatory and is part of the mobile termination.

==Automation industry==
In the automation industry, a &quot;terminal adapter&quot; is a &quot;passive&quot; device that converts a connector like the 8P8C (RJ-45) modular connector or 9 pin D-Sub into a terminal block to facilitate wiring. It is often used when daisy chain wiring is necessary on a multi-node serial communication network like RS-485 or RS-422.

<text>In telecommunications, a ternary signal is a signal that can assume, at any given instant, one of three states or significant conditions, such as power level, phase position, pulse duration, or frequency.

Examples of ternary signals are (a) a pulse that can have a positive, zero, or negative voltage value at any given instant (PAM-3), (b) a sine wave that can assume phases of 0°, 120°, or 240° relative to a clock pulse (3-PSK), and (c) a carrier signal that can assume any one of three different frequencies depending on three different modulation signal significant conditions (3-FM).

Some examples of PAM-3 line codes that use ternary signals are:
* hybrid ternary code
* bipolar encoding
* MLT-3 encoding used in 100BASE-TX Ethernet
* B3ZS
* 4B3T used in some ISDN basic rate interface
* 8B6T used in 100BASE-T4 Ethernet
* return-to-zero
* SOQPSK-TG uses ternary continuous phase modulation

3-PSK can be seen as falling between &quot;binary phase-shift keying&quot; (BPSK), which uses two phases, and &quot;quadrature phase-shift keying&quot; (QPSK), which uses four phases.

<doc id="41789" wikidata="Q264647" url="?curid=41789" title="Thermodynamic temperature">
<text>Thermodynamic temperature is a quantity defined in thermodynamics as distinct from kinetic theory or statistical mechanics.

Historically, thermodynamic temperature was defined by Lord Kelvin in terms of a macroscopic relation between thermodynamic work and heat transfer as defined in thermodynamics, but the kelvin was redefined by international agreement in 2019 in terms of phenomena that are now understood as manifestations of the kinetic energy of free motion of microscopic particles such as atoms, molecules, and electrons. From the thermodynamic viewpoint, for historical reasons, because of how it is defined and measured, this microscopic kinetic definition is regarded as an &quot;empirical&quot; temperature. It was adopted because in practice it can generally be measured more precisely than can Kelvin&#x27;s thermodynamic temperature.

A thermodynamic temperature of zero is of particular importance for the third law of thermodynamics. By convention, it is reported on the &quot;Kelvin scale&quot; of temperature in which the unit of measurement is the &quot;kelvin&quot; (unit symbol: K). For comparison, a temperature of 295 K corresponds to 21.85 °C and 71.33 °F.
== Overview ==
Thermodynamic temperature, as distinct from SI temperature, is defined in terms of a macroscopic Carnot cycle. Thermodynamic temperature is of importance in thermodynamics because it is defined in purely thermodynamic terms. SI temperature is conceptually far different from thermodynamic temperature. Thermodynamic temperature was rigorously defined historically long before there was a fair knowledge of microscopic particles such as atoms, molecules, and electrons.

The International System of Units (SI) specifies the international absolute scale for measuring temperature, and the unit of measure &quot;kelvin&quot; (unit symbol: K) for specific values along the scale. The kelvin is also used for denoting temperature &quot;intervals&quot; (a span or difference between two temperatures) as per the following example usage: &quot;A 60/40 tin/lead solder is non-eutectic and is plastic through a range of 5 kelvins as it solidifies.&quot; A temperature interval of one degree Celsius is the same magnitude as one kelvin.

The magnitude of the kelvin was redefined in 2019 in relation to the &quot;physical property&quot; underlying thermodynamic temperature: the kinetic energy of atomic free particle motion. The revision fixed the Boltzmann constant at exactly (J/K). 

The microscopic property that imbues material substances with a temperature can be readily understood by examining the ideal gas law, which relates, per the Boltzmann constant, how heat energy causes precisely defined changes in the pressure and temperature of certain gases. This is because monatomic gases like helium and argon behave kinetically like freely moving perfectly elastic and spherical billiard balls that move only in a specific subset of the possible motions that can occur in matter: that comprising the &quot;three translational&quot; degrees of freedom. The translational degrees of freedom are the familiar billiard ball-like movements along the X, Y, and Z axes of 3D space (see &quot;Fig. 1&quot;, below). This is why the noble gases all have the same specific heat capacity per atom and why that value is lowest of all the gases.

Molecules (two or more chemically bound atoms), however, have &quot;internal structure&quot; and therefore have additional &quot;internal&quot; degrees of freedom (see &quot;Fig. 3&quot;, below), which makes molecules absorb more heat energy for any given amount of temperature rise than do the monatomic gases. Heat energy is born in all available degrees of freedom; this is in accordance with the equipartition theorem, so all available internal degrees of freedom have the same temperature as their three external degrees of freedom. However, the property that gives all gases their pressure, which is the net force per unit area on a container arising from gas particles recoiling off it, is a function of the kinetic energy borne in the freely moving atoms&#x27; and molecules&#x27; three translational degrees of freedom.

Fixing the Boltzmann constant at a specific value, along with other rule making, had the effect of precisely establishing the magnitude of the unit interval of SI temperature, the kelvin, in terms of the average kinetic behavior of the noble gases. Moreover, the &quot;starting point&quot; of the thermodynamic temperature scale, absolute zero, was reaffirmed as the point at which &quot;zero average kinetic energy&quot; remains in a sample; the only remaining particle motion being that comprising random vibrations due to zero-point energy.

== Absolute zero of temperature ==
Temperature scales are numerical. The numerical zero of a temperature scale is not bound to the absolute zero of temperature. Nevertheless, some temperature scales have their numerical zero coincident with the absolute zero of temperature. Examples are the International SI temperature scale, the Rankine temperature scale, and the thermodynamic temperature scale. Other temperature scales have their numerical zero far from the absolute zero of temperature. Examples are the Fahrenheit scale and the Celsius scale.

At the zero point of thermodynamic temperature, absolute zero, the particle constituents of matter have minimal motion and can become no colder. Absolute zero, which is a temperature of zero kelvins (0 K), precisely corresponds to −273.15 °C and −459.67 °F. Matter at absolute zero has no remaining transferable average kinetic energy and the only remaining particle motion is due to an ever-pervasive quantum mechanical phenomenon called ZPE (zero-point energy). Though the atoms in, for instance, a container of liquid helium that was &quot;precisely&quot; at absolute zero would still jostle slightly due to zero-point energy, a theoretically perfect heat engine with such helium as one of its working fluids could never transfer any net kinetic energy (heat energy) to the other working fluid and no thermodynamic work could occur.

Temperature is generally expressed in absolute terms when scientifically examining temperature&#x27;s interrelationships with certain other physical properties of matter such as its volume or pressure (see Gay-Lussac&#x27;s law), or the wavelength of its emitted black-body radiation. Absolute temperature is also useful when calculating chemical reaction rates (see Arrhenius equation). Furthermore, absolute temperature is typically used in cryogenics and related phenomena like superconductivity, as per the following example usage:
&quot;Conveniently, tantalum&#x27;s transition temperature (&quot;T&quot;) of 4.4924 kelvin is slightly above the 4.2221 K boiling point of helium.&quot;

== Boltzmann constant ==
The Boltzmann constant and its related formulas describe the realm of particle kinetics and velocity vectors whereas ZPE (zero-point energy) is an energy field that jostles particles in ways described by the mathematics of quantum mechanics. In atomic and molecular collisions in gases, ZPE introduces a degree of &quot;chaos&quot;, i.e., unpredictability, to rebound kinetics; it is as likely that there will be &quot;less&quot; ZPE-induced particle motion after a given collision as &quot;more&quot;. This random nature of ZPE is why it has no net effect upon either the pressure or volume of any &quot;bulk quantity&quot; (a statistically significant quantity of particles) of gases. However, in temperature condensed matter; e.g., solids and liquids, ZPE causes inter-atomic jostling where atoms would otherwise be perfectly stationary. Inasmuch as the real-world effects that ZPE has on substances can vary as one alters a thermodynamic system (for example, due to ZPE, helium won&#x27;t freeze unless under a pressure of at least 2.5 MPa (25 bar)), ZPE is very much a form of thermal energy and may properly be included when tallying a substance&#x27;s internal energy.

== Rankine scale ==

Though there have been many other temperature scales throughout history, there have been only two scales for measuring thermodynamic temperature which have absolute zero as their null point (0): The Kelvin scale and the Rankine scale.

Throughout the scientific world where modern measurements are nearly always made using the International System of Units, thermodynamic temperature is measured using the Kelvin scale. The Rankine scale is part of English engineering units and finds use in certain engineering fields, particularly in legacy reference works. The Rankine scale uses the &quot;degree Rankine&quot; (symbol: °R) as its unit, which is the same magnitude as the degree Fahrenheit (symbol: °F).

A unit increment of one kelvin is exactly 1.8 times one degree Rankine; thus, to convert a specific temperature on the Kelvin scale to the Rankine scale, , and to convert from a temperature on the Rankine scale to the Kelvin scale, . Consequently, absolute zero is &quot;0&quot; for both scales, but the melting point of water ice (0 °C and 273.15 K) is 491.67 °R.

To convert temperature &quot;intervals&quot; (a span or difference between two temperatures), the formulas from the preceding paragraph are applicable; for instance, an interval of 5 kelvin is precisely equal to an interval of 9 degrees Rankine.

== Modern redefinition of the kelvin ==

For 65 years, between 1954 and the 2019 revision of the SI, a temperature interval of one kelvin was defined as the difference between the triple point of water and absolute zero. The 1954 resolution by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (known by the French-language acronym BIPM), plus later resolutions and publications, defined the triple point of water as precisely 273.16 K and acknowledged that it was &quot;common practice&quot; to accept that due to previous conventions (namely, that 0 °C had long been defined as the melting point of water and that the triple point of water had long been experimentally determined to be indistinguishably close to 0.01 °C), the difference between the Celsius scale and Kelvin scale is accepted as 273.15 kelvins; which is to say, 0 °C corresponds to 273.15 kelvins. The net effect of this as well as later resolutions was twofold: 1) they defined absolute zero as precisely 0 K, and 2) they defined that the triple point of special isotopically controlled water called Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water occurred at precisely 273.16 K and 0.01 °C. One effect of the aforementioned resolutions was that the melting point of water, while &quot;very&quot; close to 273.15 K and 0 °C, was not a defining value and was subject to refinement with more precise measurements.

The 1954 BIPM standard did a good job of establishing—within the uncertainties due to isotopic variations between water samples—temperatures around the freezing and triple points of water, but required that &quot;intermediate values&quot; between the triple point and absolute zero, as well as extrapolated values from room temperature and beyond, to be experimentally determined via apparatus and procedures in individual labs. This shortcoming was addressed by the International Temperature Scale of 1990, or ITS90, which defined 13 additional points, from 13.8033 K, to 1,357.77 K. While definitional, ITS90 had—and still has—some challenges, partly because eight of its extrapolated values depend upon the melting or freezing points of metal samples, which must remain exceedingly pure lest their melting or freezing points be affected—usually depressed.

The 2019 revision of the SI was primarily for the purpose of decoupling much of the SI system&#x27;s definitional underpinnings from the kilogram, which was the last physical artifact defining an SI base unit (a platinum/iridium cylinder stored under three nested bell jars in a safe located in France) and which had highly questionable stability. The solution required that four physical constants, including the Boltzmann constant, be definitionally fixed.

Assigning the Boltzmann constant a precisely defined value had no practical effect on modern thermometry except for the most exquisitely precise measurements. Before the revision, the triple point of water was exactly 273.16 K and 0.01 °C and the Boltzmann constant was experimentally determined to be , where the &quot;(51)&quot; denotes the uncertainty in the two least significant digits (the 03) and equals a relative standard uncertainty of 0.37 ppm. Afterwards, by defining the Boltzmann constant as exactly , the 0.37 ppm uncertainty was transferred to the triple point of water, which became an experimentally determined value of (). That the triple point of water ended up being exceedingly close to 273.16 K after the SI revision was no accident; the final value of the Boltzmann constant was determined, in part, through clever experiments with argon and helium that used the triple point of water for their key reference temperature.

Notwithstanding the 2019 revision, water triple-point cells continue to serve in modern thermometry as exceedingly precise calibration references at 273.16 K and 0.01 °C. Moreover, the triple point of water remains one of the 14 calibration points comprising ITS90, which spans from the triple point of hydrogen (13.8033 K) to the freezing point of copper (1,357.77 K), which is a nearly hundredfold range of thermodynamic temperature.

== Relationship of temperature, motions, conduction, and thermal energy ==

=== Nature of kinetic energy, translational motion, and temperature ===
The thermodynamic temperature of any &quot;bulk quantity&quot; of a substance (a statistically significant quantity of particles) is directly proportional to the mean average kinetic energy of a specific kind of particle motion known as &quot;translational motion&quot;. These simple movements in the three X, Y, and Z–axis dimensions of space means the particles move in the three spatial &quot;degrees of freedom&quot;. This particular form of kinetic energy is sometimes referred to as &quot;kinetic temperature&quot;. Translational motion is but one form of heat energy and is what gives gases not only their temperature, but also their pressure and the vast majority of their volume. This relationship between the temperature, pressure, and volume of gases is established by the ideal gas law&#x27;s formula and is embodied in the gas laws.

Though the kinetic energy borne exclusively in the three translational degrees of freedom comprise the thermodynamic temperature of a substance, molecules, as can be seen in &quot;Fig. 3&quot;, can have other degrees of freedom, all of which fall under three categories: bond length, bond angle, and rotational. All three additional categories are not necessarily available to all molecules, and even for molecules that &quot;can&quot; experience all three, some can be &quot;frozen out&quot; below a certain temperature. Nonetheless, all those degrees of freedom that are available to the molecules under a particular set of conditions contribute to the specific heat capacity of a substance; which is to say, they increase the amount of heat (kinetic energy) required to raise a given amount of the substance by one kelvin or one degree Celsius.

The relationship of kinetic energy, mass, and velocity is given by the formula . Accordingly, particles with one unit of mass moving at one unit of velocity have precisely the same kinetic energy, and precisely the same temperature, as those with four times the mass but half the velocity.

The extent to which the kinetic energy of translational motion in a statistically significant collection of atoms or molecules in a gas contributes to the pressure and volume of that gas is a proportional function of thermodynamic temperature as established by the Boltzmann constant (symbol: ). The Boltzmann constant also relates the thermodynamic temperature of a gas to the mean kinetic energy of an &quot;individual&quot; particles&#x27; translational motion as follows:
formula_1 
where:
* formula_2 is the mean kinetic energy for an individual particle
* is the thermodynamic temperature of the bulk quantity of the substance
While the Boltzmann constant is useful for finding the mean kinetic energy in a sample of particles, it is important to note that even when a substance is isolated and in thermodynamic equilibrium (all parts are at a uniform temperature and no heat is going into or out of it), the translational motions of individual atoms and molecules occurs across a wide range of speeds (see animation in &quot;Fig. 1&quot; above). At any one instant, the proportion of particles moving at a given speed within this range is determined by probability as described by the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. The graph shown here in &quot;Fig. 2&quot; shows the speed distribution of 5500 K helium atoms. They have a &quot;most probable&quot; speed of 4.780 km/s (0.2092 s/km). However, a certain proportion of atoms at any given instant are moving faster while others are moving relatively slowly; some are momentarily at a virtual standstill (off the &quot;x&quot;–axis to the right). This graph uses &quot;inverse speed&quot; for its &quot;x&quot;-axis so the shape of the curve can easily be compared to the curves in &quot;Fig. 5&quot; below. In both graphs, zero on the &quot;x&quot;-axis represents infinite temperature. Additionally, the &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-axes on both graphs are scaled proportionally.

==== High speeds of translational motion ====
Although very specialized laboratory equipment is required to directly detect translational motions, the resultant collisions by atoms or molecules with small particles suspended in a fluid produces Brownian motion that can be seen with an ordinary microscope. The translational motions of elementary particles are &quot;very&quot; fast and temperatures close to absolute zero are required to directly observe them. For instance, when scientists at the NIST achieved a record-setting cold temperature of 700 nK (billionths of a kelvin) in 1994, they used optical lattice laser equipment to adiabatically cool cesium atoms. They then turned off the entrapment lasers and directly measured atom velocities of 7 mm per second to in order to calculate their temperature.

It is neither difficult to imagine atomic motions due to kinetic temperature, nor distinguish between such motions and those due to zero-point energy. Consider the following hypothetical thought experiment, as illustrated in &quot;Fig. 2.5&quot; at left, with an atom that is exceedingly close to absolute zero. Imagine peering through a common optical microscope set to 400 power, which is about the maximum practical magnification for optical microscopes. Such microscopes generally provide fields of view a bit over 0.4 mm in diameter. At the center of the field of view is a single levitated argon atom (argon comprises about 0.93% of air) that is illuminated and glowing against a dark backdrop. If this argon atom was at a beyond-record-setting &quot;one-trillionth&quot; of a kelvin above absolute zero, and was moving perpendicular to the field of view towards the right, it would require 13.9 seconds to move from the center of the image to the 200-micron tick mark; this travel distance is about the same as the width of the period at the end of this sentence on modern computer monitors. As the argon atom slowly moved, the positional jitter due to zero-point energy would be much less than the 200-nanometer (0.0002 mm) resolution of an optical microscope. Importantly, the atom&#x27;s translational velocity of 14.43 microns per second constitutes all its retained kinetic energy due to not being precisely at absolute zero. Were the atom &quot;precisely&quot; at absolute zero, imperceptible jostling due to zero-point energy would cause it to very slightly wander, but the atom would perpetually be located, on average, at the same spot within the field of view. This is analogous to a boat that has had its motor turned off and is now bobbing slightly in relatively calm and windless ocean waters; even though the boat randomly drifts to and fro, it stays in the same spot in the long term and makes no headway through the water. Accordingly, an atom that was precisely at absolute zero would not be &quot;motionless&quot;, and yet, a statistically significant collection of such atoms would have zero net kinetic energy available to transfer to any other collection of atoms. This is because regardless of the kinetic temperature of the second collection of atoms, they too experience the effects of zero-point energy. Such are the consequences of statistical mechanics and the nature of thermodynamics.

==== Internal motions of molecules and internal energy ====

As mentioned above, there are other ways molecules can jiggle besides the three translational degrees of freedom that imbue substances with their kinetic temperature. As can be seen in the animation at right, molecules are complex objects; they are a population of atoms and thermal agitation can strain their internal chemical bonds in three different ways: via rotation, bond length, and bond angle movements; these are all types of &quot;internal degrees of freedom&quot;. This makes molecules distinct from &quot;monatomic&quot; substances (consisting of individual atoms) like the noble gases helium and argon, which have only the three translational degrees of freedom (the X, Y, and Z axis). Kinetic energy is stored in molecules&#x27; internal degrees of freedom, which gives them an &quot;internal temperature&quot;. Even though these motions are called &quot;internal&quot;, the external portions of molecules still move—rather like the jiggling of a stationary water balloon. This permits the two-way exchange of kinetic energy between internal motions and translational motions with each molecular collision. Accordingly, as internal energy is removed from molecules, both their kinetic temperature (the kinetic energy of translational motion) and their internal temperature simultaneously diminish in equal proportions. This phenomenon is described by the equipartition theorem, which states that for any bulk quantity of a substance in equilibrium, the kinetic energy of particle motion is evenly distributed among all the active degrees of freedom available to the particles. Since the internal temperature of molecules are usually equal to their kinetic temperature, the distinction is usually of interest only in the detailed study of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) phenomena such as combustion, the sublimation of solids, and the diffusion of hot gases in a partial vacuum.

The kinetic energy stored internally in molecules causes substances to contain more heat energy at any given temperature and to absorb additional internal energy for a given temperature increase. This is because any kinetic energy that is, at a given instant, bound in internal motions, is not contributing to the molecules&#x27; translational motions at that same instant. This extra kinetic energy simply increases the amount of internal energy that substance absorbs for a given temperature rise. This property is known as a substance&#x27;s specific heat capacity.

Different molecules absorb different amounts of internal energy for each incremental increase in temperature; that is, they have different specific heat capacities. High specific heat capacity arises, in part, because certain substances&#x27; molecules possess more internal degrees of freedom than others do. For instance, room-temperature nitrogen, which is a diatomic molecule, has &quot;five&quot; active degrees of freedom: the three comprising translational motion plus two rotational degrees of freedom internally. Not surprisingly, in accordance with the equipartition theorem, nitrogen has five-thirds the specific heat capacity per mole (a specific number of molecules) as do the monatomic gases. Another example is gasoline (see table showing its specific heat capacity). Gasoline can absorb a large amount of heat energy per mole with only a modest temperature change because each molecule comprises an average of 21 atoms and therefore has many internal degrees of freedom. Even larger, more complex molecules can have dozens of internal degrees of freedom.

=== Diffusion of thermal energy: entropy, phonons, and mobile conduction electrons ===


&quot;Heat conduction&quot; is the diffusion of thermal energy from hot parts of a system to cold parts. A system can be either a single bulk entity or a plurality of discrete bulk entities. The term &quot;bulk&quot; in this context means a statistically significant quantity of particles (which can be a microscopic amount). Whenever thermal energy diffuses within an isolated system, temperature differences within the system decrease (and entropy increases).

One particular heat conduction mechanism occurs when translational motion, the particle motion underlying temperature, transfers momentum from particle to particle in collisions. In gases, these translational motions are of the nature shown above in &quot;Fig. 1&quot;. As can be seen in that animation, not only does momentum (heat) diffuse throughout the volume of the gas through serial collisions, but entire molecules or atoms can move forward into new territory, bringing their kinetic energy with them. Consequently, temperature differences equalize throughout gases very quickly—especially for light atoms or molecules; convection speeds this process even more.

Translational motion in &quot;solids&quot;, however, takes the form of &quot;phonons&quot; (see &quot;Fig. 4&quot; at right). Phonons are constrained, quantized wave packets that travel at the speed of sound of a given substance. The manner in which phonons interact within a solid determines a variety of its properties, including its thermal conductivity. In electrically insulating solids, phonon-based heat conduction is &quot;usually&quot; inefficient and such solids are considered &quot;thermal insulators&quot; (such as glass, plastic, rubber, ceramic, and rock). This is because in solids, atoms and molecules are locked into place relative to their neighbors and are not free to roam.

Metals however, are not restricted to only phonon-based heat conduction. Thermal energy conducts through metals extraordinarily quickly because instead of direct molecule-to-molecule collisions, the vast majority of thermal energy is mediated via very light, mobile &quot;conduction electrons&quot;. This is why there is a near-perfect correlation between metals&#x27; thermal conductivity and their electrical conductivity. Conduction electrons imbue metals with their extraordinary conductivity because they are &quot;delocalized&quot; (i.e., not tied to a specific atom) and behave rather like a sort of quantum gas due to the effects of &quot;zero-point energy&quot; (for more on ZPE, see &quot;Note 1&quot; below). Furthermore, electrons are relatively light with a rest mass only that of a proton. This is about the same ratio as a .22 Short bullet (29 grains or 1.88 g) compared to the rifle that shoots it. As Isaac Newton wrote with his third law of motion,

However, a bullet accelerates faster than a rifle given an equal force. Since kinetic energy increases as the square of velocity, nearly all the kinetic energy goes into the bullet, not the rifle, even though both experience the same force from the expanding propellant gases. In the same manner, because they are much less massive, thermal energy is readily borne by mobile conduction electrons. Additionally, because they are delocalized and &quot;very&quot; fast, kinetic thermal energy conducts extremely quickly through metals with abundant conduction electrons.

=== Diffusion of thermal energy: black-body radiation ===

Thermal radiation is a byproduct of the collisions arising from various vibrational motions of atoms. These collisions cause the electrons of the atoms to emit thermal photons (known as black-body radiation). Photons are emitted anytime an electric charge is accelerated (as happens when electron clouds of two atoms collide). Even &quot;individual molecules&quot; with internal temperatures greater than absolute zero also emit black-body radiation from their atoms. In any bulk quantity of a substance at equilibrium, black-body photons are emitted across a range of wavelengths in a spectrum that has a bell curve-like shape called a Planck curve (see graph in &quot;Fig. 5&quot; at right). The top of a Planck curve (the peak emittance wavelength) is located in a particular part of the electromagnetic spectrum depending on the temperature of the black-body. Substances at extreme cryogenic temperatures emit at long radio wavelengths whereas extremely hot temperatures produce short gamma rays (see ).

Black-body radiation diffuses thermal energy throughout a substance as the photons are absorbed by neighboring atoms, transferring momentum in the process. Black-body photons also easily escape from a substance and can be absorbed by the ambient environment; kinetic energy is lost in the process.

As established by the Stefan–Boltzmann law, the intensity of black-body radiation increases as the fourth power of absolute temperature. Thus, a black-body at 824 K (just short of glowing dull red) emits 60 times the radiant power as it does at 296 K (room temperature). This is why one can so easily feel the radiant heat from hot objects at a distance. At higher temperatures, such as those found in an incandescent lamp, black-body radiation can be the principal mechanism by which thermal energy escapes a system.

==== Table of thermodynamic temperatures ====
The table below shows various points on the thermodynamic scale, in order of increasing temperature.


=== Heat of phase changes ===

The kinetic energy of particle motion is just one contributor to the total thermal energy in a substance; another is &quot;phase transitions&quot;, which are the potential energy of molecular bonds that can form in a substance as it cools (such as during condensing and freezing). The thermal energy required for a phase transition is called &quot;latent heat&quot;. This phenomenon may more easily be grasped by considering it in the reverse direction: latent heat is the energy required to &quot;break&quot; chemical bonds (such as during evaporation and melting). Almost everyone is familiar with the effects of phase transitions; for instance, steam at 100 °C can cause severe burns much faster than the 100 °C air from a hair dryer. This occurs because a large amount of latent heat is liberated as steam condenses into liquid water on the skin.

Even though thermal energy is liberated or absorbed during phase transitions, pure chemical elements, compounds, and eutectic alloys exhibit no temperature change whatsoever while they undergo them (see &quot;Fig. 7&quot;, below right). Consider one particular type of phase transition: melting. When a solid is melting, crystal lattice chemical bonds are being broken apart; the substance is transitioning from what is known as a &quot;more ordered state&quot; to a &quot;less ordered state&quot;. In &quot;Fig. 7&quot;, the melting of ice is shown within the lower left box heading from blue to green.

At one specific thermodynamic point, the melting point (which is 0 °C across a wide pressure range in the case of water), all the atoms or molecules are, on average, at the maximum energy threshold their chemical bonds can withstand without breaking away from the lattice. Chemical bonds are all-or-nothing forces: they either hold fast, or break; there is no in-between state. Consequently, when a substance is at its melting point, every joule of added thermal energy only breaks the bonds of a specific quantity of its atoms or molecules, converting them into a liquid of precisely the same temperature; no kinetic energy is added to translational motion (which is what gives substances their temperature). The effect is rather like popcorn: at a certain temperature, additional thermal energy cannot make the kernels any hotter until the transition (popping) is complete. If the process is reversed (as in the freezing of a liquid), thermal energy must be removed from a substance.

As stated above, the thermal energy required for a phase transition is called &quot;latent heat&quot;. In the specific cases of melting and freezing, it is called &quot;enthalpy of fusion&quot; or &quot;heat of fusion&quot;. If the molecular bonds in a crystal lattice are strong, the heat of fusion can be relatively great, typically in the range of 6 to 30 kJ per mole for water and most of the metallic elements. If the substance is one of the monatomic gases (which have little tendency to form molecular bonds) the heat of fusion is more modest, ranging from 0.021 to 2.3 kJ per mole. Relatively speaking, phase transitions can be truly energetic events. To completely melt ice at 0 °C into water at 0 °C, one must add roughly 80 times the thermal energy as is required to increase the temperature of the same mass of liquid water by one degree Celsius. The metals&#x27; ratios are even greater, typically in the range of 400 to 1200 times. The phase transition of boiling is much more energetic than freezing. For instance, the energy required to completely boil or vaporize water (what is known as &quot;enthalpy of vaporization&quot;) is roughly 540 times that required for a one-degree increase.

Water&#x27;s sizable enthalpy of vaporization is why one&#x27;s skin can be burned so quickly as steam condenses on it (heading from red to green in &quot;Fig. 7&quot; above); water vapors (gas phase) are liquefied on the skin with releasing a large amount of energy (enthalpy) to the environment including the skin, resulting in skin damage. In the opposite direction, this is why one&#x27;s skin feels cool as liquid water on it evaporates (a process that occurs at a sub-ambient wet-bulb temperature that is dependent on relative humidity); the water evaporation on the skin takes a large amount of energy from the environment including the skin, reducing the skin temperature. Water&#x27;s highly energetic enthalpy of vaporization is also an important factor underlying why &quot;solar pool covers&quot; (floating, insulated blankets that cover swimming pools when the pools are not in use) are so effective at reducing heating costs: they prevent evaporation. (In other words, taking energy from water when it is evaporated is limited.) For instance, the evaporation of just 20 mm of water from a 1.29-meter-deep pool chills its water .

=== Internal energy ===

The total energy of all translational and internal particle motions, including that of conduction electrons, plus the potential energy of phase changes, plus zero-point energy of a substance comprise the &quot;internal energy&quot; of it.

=== Internal energy at absolute zero ===

As a substance cools, different forms of internal energy and their related effects simultaneously decrease in magnitude: the latent heat of available phase transitions is liberated as a substance changes from a less ordered state to a more ordered state; the translational motions of atoms and molecules diminish (their kinetic energy or temperature decreases); the internal motions of molecules diminish (their internal energy or temperature decreases); conduction electrons (if the substance is an electrical conductor) travel &quot;somewhat&quot; slower; and black-body radiation&#x27;s peak emittance wavelength increases (the photons&#x27; energy decreases). When particles of a substance are as close as possible to complete rest and retain only ZPE (zero-point energy)-induced quantum mechanical motion, the substance is at the temperature of absolute zero ( = 0).
Whereas absolute zero is the point of zero thermodynamic temperature and is also the point at which the particle constituents of matter have minimal motion, absolute zero is not necessarily the point at which a substance contains zero internal energy; one must be very precise with what one means by &quot;internal energy&quot;. Often, all the phase changes that &quot;can&quot; occur in a substance, &quot;will&quot; have occurred by the time it reaches absolute zero. However, this is not always the case. Notably,  = 0 helium remains liquid at room pressure (&quot;Fig. 9&quot; at right) and must be under a pressure of at least to crystallize. This is because helium&#x27;s heat of fusion (the energy required to melt helium ice) is so low (only 21 joules per mole) that the motion-inducing effect of zero-point energy is sufficient to prevent it from freezing at lower pressures.

A further complication is that many solids change their crystal structure to more compact arrangements at extremely high pressures (up to millions of bars, or hundreds of gigapascals). These are known as &quot;solid–solid phase transitions&quot; wherein latent heat is liberated as a crystal lattice changes to a more thermodynamically favorable, compact one.

The above complexities make for rather cumbersome blanket statements regarding the internal energy in  = 0 substances. Regardless of pressure though, what &quot;can&quot; be said is that at absolute zero, all solids with a lowest-energy crystal lattice such those with a &quot;closest-packed arrangement&quot; (see &quot;Fig. 8&quot;, above left) contain minimal internal energy, retaining only that due to the ever-present background of zero-point energy. One can also say that for a given substance at constant pressure, absolute zero is the point of lowest &quot;enthalpy&quot; (a measure of work potential that takes internal energy, pressure, and volume into consideration). Lastly, all  = 0 substances contain zero kinetic thermal energy.
== Practical applications for thermodynamic temperature ==
Thermodynamic temperature is useful not only for scientists, it can also be useful for lay-people in many disciplines involving gases. By expressing variables in absolute terms and applying Gay-Lussac&#x27;s law of temperature/pressure proportionality, solutions to everyday problems are straightforward; for instance, calculating how a temperature change affects the pressure inside an automobile tire. If the tire has a cold pressure of 200 kPa, then its absolute pressure is 300 kPa. Room temperature (&quot;cold&quot; in tire terms) is 296 K. If the tire temperature is 20 °C hotter (20 kelvins), the solution is calculated as  = 6.8% greater thermodynamic temperature &quot;and&quot; absolute pressure; that is, an absolute pressure of 320 kPa, which is a of 220 kPa.
== Relationship to ideal gas law ==

The thermodynamic temperature is closely linked to the ideal gas law and its consequences. It can be linked also to the second law of thermodynamics. The thermodynamic temperature can be shown to have special properties, and in particular can be seen to be uniquely defined (up to some constant multiplicative factor) by considering the efficiency of idealized heat engines. Thus the ratio of two temperatures and is the same in all absolute scales.

Strictly speaking, the temperature of a system is well-defined only if it is at thermal equilibrium. From a microscopic viewpoint, a material is at thermal equilibrium if the quantity of heat between its individual particles cancel out. There are many possible scales of temperature, derived from a variety of observations of physical phenomena.

Loosely stated, temperature differences dictate the direction of heat between two systems such that their combined energy is maximally distributed among their lowest possible states. We call this distribution &quot;entropy&quot;. To better understand the relationship between temperature and entropy, consider the relationship between heat, work and temperature illustrated in the Carnot heat engine. The engine converts heat into work by directing a temperature gradient between a higher temperature heat source, , and a lower temperature heat sink, , through a gas filled piston. The work done per cycle is equal in magnitude to net heat taken up, which is sum of the heat taken up by the engine from the high-temperature source, plus the waste heat given off by the engine, &lt; 0. The &quot;efficiency&quot; of the engine is the work divided by the heat put into the system or

formula_3

where formula_4 is the work done per cycle. Thus the efficiency depends only on .

Carnot&#x27;s theorem states that all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient. Thus, any reversible heat engine operating between temperatures and must have the same efficiency, that is to say, the efficiency is the function of only temperatures
formula_5

In addition, a reversible heat engine operating between a pair of thermal reservoirs at temperatures and must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles, one between and another (intermediate) temperature , and the second between and . If this were not the case, then energy (in the form of ) will be wasted or gained, resulting in different overall efficiencies every time a cycle is split into component cycles; clearly a cycle can be composed of any number of smaller cycles as an engine design choice, and any reversible engine between the same reservoir at and must be equally efficient regardless of the engine design.

If we choose engines such that work done by the one cycle engine and the two cycle engine are same, then the efficiency of each heat engine is written as below.
formula_6

Here, the engine 1 is the one cycle engine, and the engines 2 and 3 make the two cycle engine where there is the intermediate reservoir at . We also have used the fact that the heat formula_7 passes through the intermediate thermal reservoir at formula_8 without losing its energy. (I.e., formula_7 is not lost during its passage through the reservoir at formula_8.) This fact can be proved by the following.
formula_11

In order to have the consistency in the last equation, the heat formula_7 flown from the engine 2 to the intermediate reservoir must be equal to the heat formula_13 flown out from the reservoir to the engine 3.

With this understanding of , and , mathematically,
formula_14

But since the first function is &quot;not&quot; a function of , the product of the final two functions &quot;must&quot; result in the removal of as a variable. The only way is therefore to define the function as follows:
formula_15
and
formula_16
so that
formula_17

I.e. the ratio of heat exchanged is a function of the respective temperatures at which they occur. We can choose any monotonic function for our formula_18; it is a matter of convenience and convention that we choose formula_19. Choosing then &quot;one&quot; fixed reference temperature (i.e. triple point of water), we establish the thermodynamic temperature scale.

Such a definition coincides with that of the ideal gas derivation; also it is this &quot;definition&quot; of the thermodynamic temperature that enables us to represent the Carnot efficiency in terms of and , and hence derive that the (complete) Carnot cycle is isentropic:
formula_20

Substituting this back into our first formula for efficiency yields a relationship in terms of temperature:
formula_21

Note that for the efficiency is 100% and that efficiency becomes greater than 100% for , which is unrealistic. Subtracting 1 from the right hand side of the Equation (4) and the middle portion gives formula_22 and thus 
formula_23

The generalization of this equation is the Clausius theorem, which proposes the existence of a state function formula_24 (i.e., a function which depends only on the state of the system, not on how it reached that state) defined (up to an additive constant) by

formula_25

where the subscript &quot;rev&quot; indicates heat transfer in a reversible process. The function formula_24 is the entropy of the system, mentioned previously, and the change of formula_24 around any cycle is zero (as is necessary for any state function). The Equation 5 can be rearranged to get an alternative definition for temperature in terms of entropy and heat (to avoid a logic loop, we should first define entropy through statistical mechanics):
formula_28

For a constant-volume system (so no mechanical work formula_29) in which the entropy formula_24 is a function formula_31 of its internal energy formula_32, formula_33 and the thermodynamic temperature formula_34 is therefore given by
formula_35
so that the reciprocal of the thermodynamic temperature is the rate of change of entropy with respect to the internal energy at the constant volume.

Guillaume Amontons (1663–1705) published two papers in 1702 and 1703 that may be used to credit him as being the first researcher to deduce the existence of a fundamental (thermodynamic) temperature scale featuring an absolute zero. He made the discovery while endeavoring to improve upon the air thermometers in use at the time. His J-tube thermometers comprised a mercury column that was supported by a fixed mass of air entrapped within the sensing portion of the thermometer. In thermodynamic terms, his thermometers relied upon the volume / temperature relationship of gas under constant pressure. His measurements of the boiling point of water and the melting point of ice showed that regardless of the mass of air trapped inside his thermometers or the weight of mercury the air was supporting, the reduction in air volume at the ice point was always the same ratio. This observation led him to posit that a sufficient reduction in temperature would reduce the air volume to zero. In fact, his calculations projected that absolute zero was equivalent to −240 °C—only 33.15 degrees short of the true value of −273.15 °C. Amonton&#x27;s discovery of a one-to-one relationship between absolute temperature and absolute pressure was rediscovered a century later and popularized within the scientific community by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac. Today, this principle of thermodynamics is commonly known as &quot;Gay-Lussac&#x27;s law&quot; but is also known as &quot;Amonton&#x27;s law&quot;.
In 1742, Anders Celsius (1701–1744) created a &quot;backwards&quot; version of the modern Celsius temperature scale. In Celsius&#x27;s original scale, zero represented the boiling point of water and 100 represented the melting point of ice. In his paper &quot;Observations of two persistent degrees on a thermometer&quot;, he recounted his experiments showing that ice&#x27;s melting point was effectively unaffected by pressure. He also determined with remarkable precision how water&#x27;s boiling point varied as a function of atmospheric pressure. He proposed that zero on his temperature scale (water&#x27;s boiling point) would be calibrated at the mean barometric pressure at mean sea level.
Coincident with the death of Anders Celsius in 1744, the botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) effectively reversed Celsius&#x27;s scale upon receipt of his first thermometer featuring a scale where zero represented the melting point of ice and 100 represented water&#x27;s boiling point. The custom-made &quot;Linnaeus-thermometer&quot;, for use in his greenhouses, was made by Daniel Ekström, Sweden&#x27;s leading maker of scientific instruments at the time. For the next 204 years, the scientific and thermometry communities worldwide referred to this scale as the &quot;centigrade scale&quot;. Temperatures on the centigrade scale were often reported simply as &quot;degrees&quot; or, when greater specificity was desired, &quot;degrees centigrade&quot;. The symbol for temperature values on this scale was °C (in several formats over the years). Because the term &quot;centigrade&quot; was also the French-language name for a unit of angular measurement (one-hundredth of a right angle) and had a similar connotation in other languages, the term &quot;centesimal degree&quot; was used when very precise, unambiguous language was required by international standards bodies such as the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). The 9th CGPM (General Conference on Weights and Measures and the CIPM (International Committee for Weights and Measures formally adopted &quot;degree Celsius&quot; (symbol: °C) in 1948.
In his book &quot;Pyrometrie&quot; (1777) completed four months before his death, Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728–1777), sometimes incorrectly referred to as Joseph Lambert, proposed an absolute temperature scale based on the pressure/temperature relationship of a fixed volume of gas. This is distinct from the volume/temperature relationship of gas under constant pressure that Guillaume Amontons discovered 75 years earlier. Lambert stated that absolute zero was the point where a simple straight-line extrapolation reached zero gas pressure and was equal to −270 °C.
Notwithstanding the work of Guillaume Amontons 85 years earlier, Jacques Alexandre César Charles (1746–1823) is often credited with discovering (circa 1787), but not publishing, that the volume of a gas under constant pressure is proportional to its absolute temperature. The formula he created was .
Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (1778–1850) published work in 1802 (acknowledging the unpublished lab notes of Jacques Charles fifteen years earlier) describing how the volume of gas under constant pressure changes linearly with its absolute (thermodynamic) temperature. This behavior is called Charles&#x27;s law and is one of the gas laws. His are the first known formulas to use the number 273 for the expansion coefficient of gas relative to the melting point of ice (indicating that absolute zero was equivalent to −273 °C).
William Thomson (1824–1907), also known as Lord Kelvin, wrote in his 1848 paper &quot;On an Absolute Thermometric Scale&quot; of the need for a scale whereby &quot;infinite cold&quot; (absolute zero) was the scale&#x27;s zero point, and which used the degree Celsius for its unit increment. Like Gay-Lussac, Thomson calculated that absolute zero was equivalent to −273 °C on the air thermometers of the time. This absolute scale is known today as the kelvin thermodynamic temperature scale. Thomson&#x27;s value of −273 was derived from 0.00366, which was the accepted expansion coefficient of gas per degree Celsius relative to the ice point. The inverse of −0.00366 expressed to five significant digits is −273.22 °C which is remarkably close to the true value of −273.15 °C.

In the paper he proposed to define temperature using idealized heat engines. In detail, he proposed that, given three heat reservoirs at temperatures formula_36, if two reversible heat engines (Carnot engine), one working between formula_37 and another between formula_38, can produce the same amount of mechanical work formula_29 by letting the same amount of heat formula_40 pass through, then define formula_41.

Note that like Carnot, Kelvin worked under the assumption that heat is conserved (&quot;the conversion of heat (or caloric) into mechanical effect is probably impossible&quot;), and if heat formula_40 goes into the heat engine, then heat formula_40 must come out.

Kelvin, realizing after Joule&#x27;s experiments that heat is not a conserved quantity but is convertible with mechanical work, modified his scale in the 1851 work &quot;An Account of Carnot&#x27;s Theory of the Motive Power of Heat&quot;. In this work, he defined as follows:

The above definition fixes the ratios between absolute temperatures, but it does not fix a scale for absolute temperature. For the scale, Thomson proposed to use the Celsius degree, that is, formula_44 the interval between the freezing and the boiling point of water.
In 1859 Macquorn Rankine (1820–1872) proposed a thermodynamic temperature scale similar to William Thomson&#x27;s but which used the degree Fahrenheit for its unit increment, that is, formula_45 the interval between the freezing and the boiling point of water. This absolute scale is known today as the Rankine thermodynamic temperature scale.
Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906) made major contributions to thermodynamics between 1877 and 1884 through an understanding of the role that particle kinetics and black body radiation played. His name is now attached to several of the formulas used today in thermodynamics.

Gas thermometry experiments carefully calibrated to the melting point of ice and boiling point of water showed in the 1930s that absolute zero was equivalent to −273.15 °C.

Resolution 3 of the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in 1948 fixed the triple point of water at precisely 0.01 °C. At this time, the triple point still had no formal definition for its equivalent kelvin value, which the resolution declared &quot;will be fixed at a later date&quot;. The implication is that if the value of absolute zero measured in the 1930s was truly −273.15 °C, then the triple point of water (0.01 °C) was equivalent to 273.16 K. Additionally, both the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) and the CGPM formally adopted the name &quot;Celsius&quot; for the &quot;degree Celsius&quot; and the &quot;Celsius temperature scale&quot;.

Resolution 3 of the 10th CGPM in 1954 gave the kelvin scale its modern definition by choosing the triple point of water as its upper defining point (with no change to absolute zero being the null point) and assigning it a temperature of precisely 273.16 kelvins (what was actually written 273.16 &quot;degrees Kelvin&quot; at the time). This, in combination with Resolution 3 of the 9th CGPM, had the effect of defining absolute zero as being precisely zero kelvins and −273.15 °C.

Resolution 3 of the 13th CGPM in 1967/1968 renamed the unit increment of thermodynamic temperature &quot;kelvin&quot;, symbol K, replacing &quot;degree absolute&quot;, symbol . Further, feeling it useful to more explicitly define the magnitude of the unit increment, the 13th CGPM also decided in Resolution 4 that &quot;The kelvin, unit of thermodynamic temperature, is the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water&quot;.

The CIPM affirmed in 2005 that for the purposes of delineating the temperature of the triple point of water, the definition of the kelvin thermodynamic temperature scale would refer to water having an isotopic composition defined as being precisely equal to the nominal specification of Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water.

In November 2018, the 26th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) changed the definition of the Kelvin by fixing the Boltzmann constant to when expressed in the unit J/K. This change (and other changes in the definition of SI units) was made effective on the 144th anniversary of the Metre Convention, 20 May 2019.

<doc id="41790" wikidata="Q1665922" url="?curid=41790" title="Third-order intercept point">
<text>In telecommunications, a third-order intercept point (IP3 or TOI) is a specific figure of merit associated with the more general third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3), which is a measure for weakly nonlinear systems and devices, for example receivers, linear amplifiers and mixers. It is based on the idea that the device nonlinearity can be modeled using a low-order polynomial, derived by means of Taylor series expansion. The third-order intercept point relates nonlinear products caused by the third-order nonlinear term to the linearly amplified signal, in contrast to the second-order intercept point that uses second-order terms.

The intercept point is a purely mathematical concept and does not correspond to a practically occurring physical power level. In many cases, it lies far beyond the damage threshold of the device.

==Definitions==
Two different definitions for intercept points are in use:

* &quot;Based on harmonics&quot;: The device is tested using a single input tone. The nonlinear products caused by &quot;n&quot;-th-order nonlinearity appear at &quot;n&quot; times the frequency of the input tone.
* &quot;Based on intermodulation products&quot;: The device is fed with two sine tones one at formula_1 and one at formula_2. When you cube the sum of these sine waves you will get sine waves at various frequencies including formula_3 and formula_4. If formula_1 and formula_2 are large but very close together then formula_3 and formula_4 will be very close to formula_1 and formula_2. This two-tone approach has the advantage that it is not restricted to broadband devices and is commonly used for radio receivers.
The intercept point is obtained graphically by plotting the output power versus the input power both on logarithmic scales (e.g., decibels). Two curves are drawn; one for the linearly amplified signal at an input tone frequency, one for a nonlinear product.
On a logarithmic scale, the function &quot;xn&quot; translates into a straight line with slope of &quot;n&quot;. Therefore, the linearly amplified signal will exhibit a slope of 1. A third-order nonlinear product will increase by 3 dB in power when the input power is raised by 1 dB.

Both curves are extended with straight lines of slope 1 and &quot;n&quot; (3 for a third-order intercept point). The point where the curves intersect is the intercept point. It can be read off from the input or output power axis, leading to input (IIP3) or output (OIP3) intercept point respectively.

Input and output intercept point differ by the small-signal gain of the device.


==Practical considerations==
The concept of intercept point is based on the assumption of a weakly nonlinear system, meaning that higher-order nonlinear terms are small enough to be negligible.
In practice, the weakly nonlinear assumption may not hold for the upper end of the input power range, be it during measurement or during use of the amplifier. As a consequence, measured or simulated data will deviate from the ideal slope of &quot;n&quot;.
The intercept point according to its basic definition should be determined by drawing the straight lines with slope 1 and &quot;n&quot; through the measured data at the smallest possible power level (possibly limited towards lower power levels by instrument or device noise).
It is a frequent mistake to derive intercept points by either changing the slope of the straight lines, or fitting them to points measured at too high power levels. In certain situations such a measure can be useful, but it is not an intercept point according to definition. Its value depends on the measurement conditions that need to be documented, whereas the IP according to definition is mostly unambiguous; although there is some dependency on frequency and tone spacing, depending on the physics of the device under test.

One of the useful applications of third-order intercept point is as a rule-of-thumb measure to estimate nonlinear products. When comparing systems or devices for linearity, a higher intercept point is better. It can be seen that the spacing between two straight lines with slopes of 3 and 1 closes with slope 2.

For example, assume a device with an input-referred third-order intercept point of 10 dBm is driven with a test signal of −5 dBm. This power is 15 dB below the intercept point, therefore nonlinear products will appear at approximately 2×15 dB below the test signal power at the device output (in other words, 3×15 dB below the output-referred third-order intercept point).

A rule of thumb that holds for many linear radio-frequency amplifiers is that the 1 dB compression point point falls approximately 10 dB below the third-order intercept point.

==Theory==
The third-order intercept point (TOI) is a property of the device transfer function &quot;O&quot; (see diagram).
This transfer function relates the output signal voltage level to the input signal voltage level. We assume a &quot;linear&quot; device having a transfer function whose small-signal form may be expressed in terms of a power series containing only odd terms, making the transfer function an odd function of input signal voltage, i.e., &quot;O&quot;(−&quot;s&quot;) = −&quot;O&quot;(&quot;s&quot;). Where the signals passing through the actual device are modulated sinusoidal voltage waveforms (e.g., RF amplifier), device nonlinearities can be expressed in terms of how they affect individual sinusoidal signal components. For example, say the input voltage signal is the sine wave

:formula_11

and the device transfer function produces an output of the form

:formula_12

where &quot;G&quot; is the amplifier gain, and &quot;D&quot;3 is cubic distortion. We may substitute the first equation into the second and, using the trigonometric identity

:formula_13

we obtain the device output voltage waveform as

:formula_14

The output waveform contains the original waveform, cos(&quot;ωt&quot;), plus a new harmonic term, cos(3&quot;ωt&quot;), the &quot;third-order term&quot;. The coefficient of the cos(&quot;ωt&quot;) harmonic has two terms, one that varies linearly with &quot;V&quot; and one that varies with the cube of &quot;V&quot;. In fact, the coefficient of cos(&quot;ωt&quot;) has nearly the same form as the transfer function, except for the factor on the cubic term. In other words, as signal level &quot;V&quot; is increased, the level of the cos(&quot;ωt&quot;) term in the output eventually levels off, similar to how the transfer function levels off. Of course, the coefficients of the higher-order harmonics will increase (with increasing &quot;V&quot;) as the coefficient of the cos(&quot;ωt&quot;) term levels off (the power has to go somewhere).

If we now restrict our attention to the portion of the cos(&quot;ωt&quot;) coefficient that varies linearly with &quot;V&quot;, and then ask ourselves, at what input voltage level &quot;V&quot; will the coefficients of the first- and third-order terms have equal magnitudes (i.e., where the magnitudes intersect), we find that this happens when

:formula_15

which is the third-order intercept point (TOI). So, we see that the TOI input power level is simply 4/3 times the ratio of the gain and the cubic distortion term in the device transfer function. The smaller the cubic term is in relation to the gain, the more linear the device is, and the higher the TOI is. The TOI, being related to the magnitude squared of the input voltage waveform, is a power quantity, typically measured in milliwatts (mW). The TOI is always beyond operational power levels because the output power saturates before reaching this level.

The TOI is closely related to the amplifier&#x27;s &quot;1 dB compression point&quot;, which is defined as that point at which the &quot;total&quot; coefficient of the cos(&quot;ωt&quot;) term is 1 dB below the &quot;linear portion&quot; of that coefficient. We can relate the 1 dB compression point to the TOI as follows. Since 1 dB = 20 log10 1.122, we may say, in a voltage sense, that the 1 dB compression point occurs when

:formula_16

or

:formula_17

or

:formula_18

In a power sense (&quot;V&quot;2 is a power quantity), a factor of 0.10875 corresponds to −9.636 dB, so by this approximate analysis, the 1 dB compression point occurs roughly 9.6 dB below the TOI.

Recall: decibel figure = 10 dB × log10(power ratio) = 20 dB × log10(voltage ratio).

* Second-order intercept point

==Notes==
* The third-order intercept point is an extrapolated convergence – not directly measurable – of intermodulation distortion products in the desired output.
* It indicates how well a device (for example an amplifier) or a system (for example, a receiver) performs in the presence of strong signals.
* It is sometimes used (interchangeably with the 1 dB compression point) to define the upper limit of the dynamic range of an amplifier.
* Determination of a third-order intercept point of a superheterodyne receiver is accomplished by using two test frequencies that fall within the first intermediate frequency mixer passband. Usually, the test frequencies are about 20–30 kHz apart.
* The concept of intercept point has no meaning for strongly nonlinear systems, such as when an output signal is clipped due to limited supply voltage.

<doc id="41792" wikidata="Q2603561" url="?curid=41792" title="Time-assignment speech interpolation">
<text>In telecommunications, a time-assignment speech interpolation (TASI) was an analog technique used on certain long transmission links to increase voice transmission capacity.

TASI was invented by Bell Labs in the early 1960s to increase the capacity of transatlantic telephone cables. It was one of their first applications requiring electronic switching of voice circuits.

Later digital circuit multiplication equipment included TASI as a feature, not as distinct hardware.

==Operation==
TASI takes advantage of the fact that in typical person-person conversation, speech in a single direction occurs for approximately 40% of the time, the remaining time being occupied with pauses and/or silence. Statistical analysis demonstrated that for an average voice channel usage of 40%, over 74 speech conversations could be handled using 37 full Duplex speech circuits thereby doubling potential revenue for a small capital outlay relative to a highly expensive cable. e.g. £12.5 million (£263 million as of 2014) cost of the TAT-1 cable on which TASI was implemented.

TASI worked by switching additional users onto any voice channel temporarily idled because an original user has stopped speaking. When the original user resumes speaking, that user would, in turn, be switched to any channel that happened to be idle. The speech detector function is called voice activity detection. Clipping or loss of speech would occur for all conversations that needed to be assigned to an available idle channel and in practice lasted at least 17 ms whilst information required to re-connect both parties was signalled by the TASI control circuits. An additional freezeout period lasting between 0 and 500 ms would depend on the instantaneous loading of voice circuits. In actual use, these delays presented few problems in typical conversations.

One of the issues with using this type of technology was that the users listening on an idled channel can sometimes hear the conversation that has been switched onto it. Generally the sound heard was of very low volume and individual words are not distinguishable. See also crosstalk for a similar phenomenon in telecommunications. Another potential issue was ensuring that non-voice type circuits (e.g. Music or radio type circuits where pauses would occur infrequently) were not routed via TASI speech channels since these could seriously degrade the level of service where callers would encounter frequent clipped speech and breaks in the conversation.

<doc id="41795" wikidata="Q240464" url="?curid=41795" title="Minimum spanning tree">
<text>A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. That is, it is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible. More generally, any edge-weighted undirected graph (not necessarily connected) has a minimum spanning forest, which is a union of the minimum spanning trees for its connected components.

There are many use cases for minimum spanning trees. One example is a telecommunications company trying to lay cable in a new neighborhood. If it is constrained to bury the cable only along certain paths (e.g. roads), then there would be a graph containing the points (e.g. houses) connected by those paths. Some of the paths might be more expensive, because they are longer, or require the cable to be buried deeper; these paths would be represented by edges with larger weights. Currency is an acceptable unit for edge weight – there is no requirement for edge lengths to obey normal rules of geometry such as the triangle inequality. A &quot;spanning tree&quot; for that graph would be a subset of those paths that has no cycles but still connects every house; there might be several spanning trees possible. A &quot;minimum spanning tree&quot; would be one with the lowest total cost, representing the least expensive path for laying the cable.

==Properties==

===Possible multiplicity===
If there are vertices in the graph, then each spanning tree has edges.
There may be several minimum spanning trees of the same weight; in particular, if all the edge weights of a given graph are the same, then every spanning tree of that graph is minimum.

===Uniqueness===
&quot;If each edge has a distinct weight then there will be only one, unique minimum spanning tree&quot;. This is true in many realistic situations, such as the telecommunications company example above, where it&#x27;s unlikely any two paths have &quot;exactly&quot; the same cost. This generalizes to spanning forests as well.

Proof:
# Assume the contrary, that there are two different MSTs and .
# Since and differ despite containing the same nodes, there is at least one edge that belongs to one but not the other. Among such edges, let be the one with least weight; this choice is unique because the edge weights are all distinct. Without loss of generality, assume is in .
# As is an MST, must contain a cycle with .
# As a tree, contains no cycles, therefore must have an edge that is not in .
# Since was chosen as the unique lowest-weight edge among those belonging to exactly one of and , the weight of must be greater than the weight of .
# As and are part of the cycle , replacing with in therefore yields a spanning tree with a smaller weight.
# This contradicts the assumption that is an MST.

More generally, if the edge weights are not all distinct then only the (multi-)set of weights in minimum spanning trees is certain to be unique; it is the same for all minimum spanning trees.

===Minimum-cost subgraph===
If the weights are &quot;positive&quot;, then a minimum spanning tree is, in fact, a minimum-cost subgraph connecting all vertices, since if a subgraph contains a cycle, removing any edge along that cycle will decrease its cost and preserve connectivity.

===Cycle property===
&quot;For any cycle in the graph, if the weight of an edge of is larger than any of the individual weights of all other edges of , then this edge cannot belong to an MST.&quot;

Proof: Assume the contrary, i.e. that belongs to an MST . Then deleting will break into two subtrees with the two ends of in different subtrees. The remainder of reconnects the subtrees, hence there is an edge of with ends in different subtrees, i.e., it reconnects the subtrees into a tree with weight less than that of , because the weight of is less than the weight of .

===Cut property===
&quot;For any cut of the graph, if the weight of an edge in the cut-set of is strictly smaller than the weights of all other edges of the cut-set of , then this edge belongs to all MSTs of the graph.&quot;

Proof: Assume that there is an MST that does not contain . Adding to will produce a cycle, that crosses the cut once at and crosses back at another edge . Deleting we get a spanning tree of strictly smaller weight than . This contradicts the assumption that was a MST.

By a similar argument, if more than one edge is of minimum weight across a cut, then each such edge is contained in some minimum spanning tree.

===Minimum-cost edge===
&quot;If the minimum cost edge of a graph is unique, then this edge is included in any MST.&quot;

Proof: if was not included in the MST, removing any of the (larger cost) edges in the cycle formed after adding to the MST, would yield a spanning tree of smaller weight.

===Contraction===
If is a tree of MST edges, then we can &quot;contract&quot; into a single vertex while maintaining the invariant that the MST of the contracted graph plus gives the MST for the graph before contraction.

==Algorithms==

In all of the algorithms below, is the number of edges in the graph and is the number of vertices.

=== Classic algorithms ===
The first algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree was developed by Czech scientist Otakar Borůvka in 1926 (see Borůvka&#x27;s algorithm). Its purpose was an efficient electrical coverage of Moravia. The algorithm proceeds in a sequence of stages. In each stage, called &quot;Boruvka step&quot;, it identifies a forest consisting of the minimum-weight edge incident to each vertex in the graph , then forms the graph as the input to the next step. Here denotes the graph derived from by contracting edges in (by the Cut property, these edges belong to the MST). Each Boruvka step takes linear time. Since the number of vertices is reduced by at least half in each step, Boruvka&#x27;s algorithm takes time.

A second algorithm is Prim&#x27;s algorithm, which was invented by Vojtěch Jarník in 1930 and rediscovered by Prim in 1957 and Dijkstra in 1959. Basically, it grows the MST () one edge at a time. Initially, contains an arbitrary vertex. In each step, is augmented with a least-weight edge such that is in and is not yet in . By the Cut property, all edges added to are in the MST. Its run-time is either or , depending on the data-structures used.

A third algorithm commonly in use is Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm, which also takes time.

A fourth algorithm, not as commonly used, is the reverse-delete algorithm, which is the reverse of Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm. Its runtime is .

All four of these are greedy algorithms. Since they run in polynomial time, the problem of finding such trees is in FP, and related decision problems such as determining whether a particular edge is in the MST or determining if the minimum total weight exceeds a certain value are in P.

=== Faster algorithms ===
Several researchers have tried to find more computationally-efficient algorithms.

In a comparison model, in which the only allowed operations on edge weights are pairwise comparisons, found a linear time randomized algorithm based on a combination of Borůvka&#x27;s algorithm and the reverse-delete algorithm.

The fastest non-randomized comparison-based algorithm with known complexity, by Bernard Chazelle, is based on the soft heap, an approximate priority queue. Its running time is , where is the classical functional inverse of the Ackermann function. The function grows extremely slowly, so that for all practical purposes it may be considered a constant no greater than 4; thus Chazelle&#x27;s algorithm takes very close to linear time.

=== Linear-time algorithms in special cases ===

==== Dense graphs ====

If the graph is dense (i.e. , then a deterministic algorithm by Fredman and Tarjan finds the MST in time . The algorithm executes a number of phases. Each phase executes Prim&#x27;s algorithm many times, each for a limited number of steps. The run-time of each phase is . If the number of vertices before a phase is , the number of vertices remaining after a phase is at most formula_1. Hence, at most phases are needed, which gives a linear run-time for dense graphs.

There are other algorithms that work in linear time on dense graphs.

==== Integer weights ====

If the edge weights are integers represented in binary, then deterministic algorithms are known that solve the problem in integer operations.
Whether the problem can be solved &quot;deterministically&quot; for a &quot;general graph&quot; in &quot;linear time&quot; by a comparison-based algorithm remains an open question.

=== Decision trees ===
Given graph where the nodes and edges are fixed but the weights are unknown, it is possible to construct a binary decision tree (DT) for calculating the MST for any permutation of weights. Each internal node of the DT contains a comparison between two edges, e.g. &quot;Is the weight of the edge between and larger than the weight of the edge between and ?&quot;. The two children of the node correspond to the two possible answers &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. In each leaf of the DT, there is a list of edges from that correspond to an MST. The runtime complexity of a DT is the largest number of queries required to find the MST, which is just the depth of the DT. A DT for a graph is called &quot;optimal&quot; if it has the smallest depth of all correct DTs for .

For every integer , it is possible to find optimal decision trees for all graphs on vertices by brute-force search. This search proceeds in two steps.

A. Generating all potential DTs
* There are formula_2 different graphs on vertices.
* For each graph, an MST can always be found using comparisons, e.g. by Prim&#x27;s algorithm.
* Hence, the depth of an optimal DT is less than .
* Hence, the number of internal nodes in an optimal DT is less than formula_3.
* Every internal node compares two edges. The number of edges is at most so the different number of comparisons is at most .
* Hence, the number of potential DTs is less than

formula_4

B. Identifying the correct DTs
To check if a DT is correct, it should be checked on all possible permutations of the edge weights.
* The number of such permutations is at most .
* For each permutation, solve the MST problem on the given graph using any existing algorithm, and compare the result to the answer given by the DT.
* The running time of any MST algorithm is at most , so the total time required to check all permutations is at most .

Hence, the total time required for finding an optimal DT for &quot;all&quot; graphs with vertices is:
:formula_5
which is less than
:formula_6

=== Optimal algorithm ===

Seth Pettie and Vijaya Ramachandran have found a optimal deterministic comparison-based minimum spanning tree algorithm. The following is a simplified description of the algorithm.

# Let , where is the number of vertices. Find all optimal decision trees on vertices. This can be done in time (see Decision trees above).
# Partition the graph to components with at most vertices in each component. This partition uses a soft heap, which &quot;corrupts&quot; a small number of the edges of the graph.
# Use the optimal decision trees to find an MST for the uncorrupted subgraph within each component.
# Contract each connected component spanned by the MSTs to a single vertex, and apply any algorithm which works on dense graphs in time to the contraction of the uncorrupted subgraph
# Add back the corrupted edges to the resulting forest to form a subgraph guaranteed to contain the minimum spanning tree, and smaller by a constant factor than the starting graph. Apply the optimal algorithm recursively to this graph.

The runtime of all steps in the algorithm is , &quot;except for the step of using the decision trees&quot;. The runtime of this step is unknown, but it has been proved that it is optimal - no algorithm can do better than the optimal decision tree. Thus, this algorithm has the peculiar property that it is &quot; optimal&quot; although its runtime complexity is &quot;unknown&quot;.

=== Parallel and distributed algorithms ===

Research has also considered parallel algorithms for the minimum spanning tree problem.
With a linear number of processors it is possible to solve the problem in time.

The problem can also be approached in a distributed manner. If each node is considered a computer and no node knows anything except its own connected links, one can still calculate the distributed minimum spanning tree.

==MST on complete graphs with random weights==
Alan M. Frieze showed that given a complete graph on &quot;n&quot; vertices, with edge weights that are independent identically distributed random variables with distribution function formula_7 satisfying formula_8, then as &quot;n&quot; approaches +∞ the expected weight of the MST approaches formula_9, where formula_10 is the Riemann zeta function (more specifically is formula_11 Apéry&#x27;s constant). Frieze and Steele also proved convergence in probability. Svante Janson proved a central limit theorem for weight of the MST.

For uniform random weights in formula_12, the exact expected size of the minimum spanning tree has been computed for small complete graphs.

== Fractional variant ==
There is a fractional variant of the MST, in which each edge is allowed to appear &quot;fractionally&quot;. Formally, a fractional spanning set of a graph (V,E) is a nonnegative function &quot;f&quot; on &quot;E&quot; such that, for every non-trivial subset &quot;W&quot; of &quot;V&quot; (i.e., &quot;W&quot; is neither empty nor equal to &quot;V&quot;), the sum of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;e&quot;) over all edges connecting a node of &quot;W&quot; with a node of &quot;V&quot;\&quot;W&quot; is at least 1. Intuitively, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;e&quot;) represents the fraction of e that is contained in the spanning set. A minimum fractional spanning set is a fractional spanning set for which the sum formula_13 is as small as possible.

If the fractions &quot;f&quot;(&quot;e&quot;) are forced to be in {0,1}, then the set &quot;T&quot; of edges with f(e)=1 are a spanning set, as every node or subset of nodes is connected to the rest of the graph by at least one edge of &quot;T&quot;. Moreover, if &quot;f&quot; minimizesformula_13, then the resulting spanning set is necessarily a tree, since if it contained a cycle, then an edge could be removed without affecting the spanning condition. So the minimum fractional spanning set problem is a relaxation of the MST problem, and can also be called the fractional MST problem.

The fractional MST problem can be solved in polynomial time using the ellipsoid method. However, if we add a requirement that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;e&quot;) must be half-integer (that is, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;e&quot;) must be in {0, 1/2, 1}), then the problem becomes NP-hard, since it includes as a special case the Hamiltonian cycle problem: in an formula_15-vertex unweighted graph, a half-integer MST of weight formula_16 can only be obtained by assigning weight 1/2 to each edge of a Hamiltonian cycle.

==Other variants==
* The Steiner tree of a subset of the vertices is the minimum tree that spans the given subset. Finding the Steiner tree is NP-Complete.

* The &quot;k&quot;-minimum spanning tree (&quot;k&quot;-MST) is the tree that spans some subset of &quot;k&quot; vertices in the graph with minimum weight.
* A set of k-smallest spanning trees is a subset of &quot;k&quot; spanning trees (out of all possible spanning trees) such that no spanning tree outside the subset has smaller weight. (Note that this problem is unrelated to the &quot;k&quot;-minimum spanning tree.)
* The Euclidean minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree of a graph with edge weights corresponding to the Euclidean distance between vertices which are points in the plane (or space).
* The rectilinear minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree of a graph with edge weights corresponding to the rectilinear distance between vertices which are points in the plane (or space).
* The distributed minimum spanning tree is an extension of MST to the distributed model, where each node is considered a computer and no node knows anything except its own connected links. The mathematical definition of the problem is the same but there are different approaches for a solution.
* The capacitated minimum spanning tree is a tree that has a marked node (origin, or root) and each of the subtrees attached to the node contains no more than &quot;c&quot; nodes. &quot;c&quot; is called a tree capacity. Solving CMST optimally is NP-hard, but good heuristics such as Esau-Williams and Sharma produce solutions close to optimal in polynomial time.
* The degree-constrained minimum spanning tree is a MST in which each vertex is connected to no more than &quot;d&quot; other vertices, for some given number &quot;d&quot;. The case &quot;d&quot; = 2 is a special case of the traveling salesman problem, so the degree constrained minimum spanning tree is NP-hard in general.
* An arborescence is a variant of MST for directed graphs. It can be solved in formula_17 time using the Chu–Liu/Edmonds algorithm.
* A maximum spanning tree is a spanning tree with weight greater than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. Such a tree can be found with algorithms such as Prim&#x27;s or Kruskal&#x27;s after multiplying the edge weights by -1 and solving the MST problem on the new graph. A path in the maximum spanning tree is the widest path in the graph between its two endpoints: among all possible paths, it maximizes the weight of the minimum-weight edge. Maximum spanning trees find applications in parsing algorithms for natural languages and in training algorithms for conditional random fields.
* The dynamic MST problem concerns the update of a previously computed MST after an edge weight change in the original graph or the insertion/deletion of a vertex.
* The minimum labeling spanning tree problem is to find a spanning tree with least types of labels if each edge in a graph is associated with a label from a finite label set instead of a weight.
* A bottleneck edge is the highest weighted edge in a spanning tree. A spanning tree is a minimum bottleneck spanning tree (or MBST) if the graph does not contain a spanning tree with a smaller bottleneck edge weight. A MST is necessarily a MBST ( by the cut property), but a MBST is not necessarily a MST.
* A minimum-cost spanning tree game is a cooperative game in which the players have to share among them the costs of constructing the optimal spanning tree.
* The optimal network design problem is the problem of computing a set, subject to a budget constraint, which contains a spanning tree, such that the sum of shortest paths between every pair of nodes is as small as possible.

==Applications==
Minimum spanning trees have direct applications in the design of networks, including computer networks, telecommunications networks, transportation networks, water supply networks, and electrical grids (which they were first invented for, as mentioned above). They are invoked as subroutines in algorithms for other problems, including the Christofides algorithm for approximating the traveling salesman problem, approximating the multi-terminal minimum cut problem (which is equivalent in the single-terminal case to the maximum flow problem),
and approximating the minimum-cost weighted perfect matching.

Other practical applications based on minimal spanning trees include:
* Taxonomy.
* Cluster analysis: clustering points in the plane, single-linkage clustering (a method of hierarchical clustering), graph-theoretic clustering, and clustering gene expression data.
* Constructing trees for broadcasting in computer networks.
* Image registration and segmentation – see minimum spanning tree-based segmentation.
* Curvilinear feature extraction in computer vision.
* Handwriting recognition of mathematical expressions.
* Circuit design: implementing efficient multiple constant multiplications, as used in finite impulse response filters.
* Regionalisation of socio-geographic areas, the grouping of areas into homogeneous, contiguous regions.
* Comparing ecotoxicology data.
* Topological observability in power systems.
* Measuring homogeneity of two-dimensional materials.
* Minimax process control.
* Minimum spanning trees can also be used to describe financial markets. A correlation matrix can be created by calculating a coefficient of correlation between any two stocks. This matrix can be represented topologically as a complex network and a minimum spanning tree can be constructed to visualize relationships.

<text>Time-division multiplexing (TDM) is a method of transmitting and receiving independent signals over a common signal path by means of synchronized switches at each end of the transmission line so that each signal appears on the line only a fraction of time according to agreed rules, e.g. with each transmitter working in turn. It can be used when the bit rate of the transmission medium exceeds that of the signal to be transmitted. This form of signal multiplexing was developed in telecommunications for telegraphy systems in the late 19th century but found its most common application in digital telephony in the second half of the 20th century.

==History==

Time-division multiplexing was first developed for applications in telegraphy to route multiple transmissions simultaneously over a single transmission line. In the 1870s, Émile Baudot developed a time-multiplexing system of multiple Hughes telegraph machines.

In 1944, the British Army used the Wireless Set No. 10 to multiplex 10 telephone conversations over a microwave relay as far as 50 miles. This allowed commanders in the field to keep in contact with the staff in England across the English Channel.

In 1953, a 24-channel time-division multiplexer was placed in commercial operation by RCA Communications to send audio information between RCA&#x27;s facility on Broad Street, New York, their transmitting station at Rocky Point and the receiving station at Riverhead, Long Island, New York. The communication was by a microwave system throughout Long Island. The experimental TDM system was developed by RCA Laboratories between 1950 and 1953.

In 1962, engineers from Bell Labs developed the first D1 channel banks, which combined 24 digitized voice calls over a four-wire copper trunk line between Bell central office analogue switches. A &quot;channel bank&quot; at each end of the line allowed the single line to carry short portions, each of a second, of up to 24 voice calls, in turn. The discrete signals on the trunk line carried 1.544 Mbit/s divided into separate &quot;frames&quot; per second, each composed of 24 contiguous octets and one framing bit. Each octet in a frame carried a single telephone call in turn. Thus each of 24 voice calls was encoded into two constant-bit-rate streams of 64 kbit/s (one in each direction), and converted back to conventional analog signals by the complementary equipment on the receiving end of the trunk line.

==Technology==
Time-division multiplexing is used primarily for digital signals but may be applied in analog multiplexing, as above, in which two or more signals or bit streams are transferred appearing simultaneously as sub-channels in one communication channel, but are physically taking turns on the channel. The time domain is divided into several recurrent &quot;time slots&quot; of fixed length, one for each sub-channel. A sample byte or data block of sub-channel 1 is transmitted during time slot 1, sub-channel 2 during time slot 2, etc. One TDM frame consists of one time slot per sub-channel, and usually a synchronization channel and sometimes an error correction channel. After all of these the cycle starts again with a new frame, starting with the second sample, byte or data block from sub-channel 1, etc.

==Application examples==
* The plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) system, also known as the PCM system, for digital transmission of several telephone calls over the same four-wire copper cable (T-carrier or E-carrier) or fiber in the circuit-switched digital telephone network
* The synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH)/synchronous optical networking (SONET) network transmission standards that have replaced PDH
* The Basic Rate Interface and Primary Rate Interface for the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
* The RIFF (WAV) audio standard interleaves left and right stereo signals on a per-sample basis

TDM can be further extended into the time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme, where several stations connected to the same physical medium, for example sharing the same frequency channel, can communicate. Application examples include:
* The GSM telephone system
* The Tactical Data Links Link 16 and Link 22

==Multiplexed digital transmission==
In circuit-switched networks, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), it is desirable to transmit multiple subscriber calls over the same transmission medium to effectively utilize the bandwidth of the medium. TDM allows transmitting and receiving telephone switches to create channels (&quot;tributaries&quot;) within a transmission stream. A standard DS0 voice signal has a data bit rate of 64 kbit/s. A TDM circuit runs at a much higher signal bandwidth, permitting the bandwidth to be divided into time frames (time slots) for each voice signal which is multiplexed onto the line by the transmitter. If the TDM frame consists of &quot;n&quot; voice frames, the line bandwidth is &quot;n&quot;*64 kbit/s.

Each voice time slot in the TDM frame is called a channel. In European systems, standard TDM frames contain 30 digital voice channels (E1), and in American systems (T1), they contain 24 channels. Both standards also contain extra bits (or bit time slots) for signaling and synchronization bits.

Multiplexing more than 24 or 30 digital voice channels is called &quot;higher order multiplexing&quot;. Higher order multiplexing is accomplished by multiplexing the standard TDM frames. For example, a European 120 channel TDM frame is formed by multiplexing four standard 30 channel TDM frames. At each higher order multiplex, four TDM frames from the immediate lower order are combined, creating multiplexes with a bandwidth of &quot;n&quot;*64 kbit/s, where &quot;n&quot; = 120, 480, 1920, etc.

==Telecommunications systems==
There are three types of synchronous TDM: T1, SONET/SDH, and ISDN.

Plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) was developed as a standard for multiplexing higher order frames. PDH created larger numbers of channels by multiplexing the standard Europeans 30 channel TDM frames. This solution worked for a while; however PDH suffered from several inherent drawbacks which ultimately resulted in the development of the Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH). The requirements which drove the development of SDH were these:

*Be synchronous – All clocks in the system must align with a reference clock.
*Be service-oriented – SDH must route traffic from End Exchange to End Exchange without worrying about exchanges in between, where the bandwidth can be reserved at a fixed level for a fixed period of time.
*Allow frames of any size to be removed or inserted into an SDH frame of any size.
*Easily manageable with the capability of transferring management data across links.
*Provide high levels of recovery from faults.
*Provide high data rates by multiplexing any size frame, limited only by technology.
*Give reduced bit rate errors.

SDH has become the primary transmission protocol in most PSTN networks. It was developed to allow streams 1.544 Mbit/s and above to be multiplexed, in order to create larger SDH frames known as Synchronous Transport Modules (STM). The STM-1 frame consists of smaller streams that are multiplexed to create a 155.52 Mbit/s frame. SDH can also multiplex packet based frames e.g. Ethernet, PPP and ATM.

While SDH is considered to be a transmission protocol (Layer 1 in the OSI Reference Model), it also performs some switching functions, as stated in the third bullet point requirement listed above. The most common SDH Networking functions are these:

*&quot;SDH Crossconnect&quot; – The SDH Crossconnect is the SDH version of a time–space–time crosspoint switch. It connects any channel on any of its inputs to any channel on any of its outputs. The SDH Crossconnect is used in Transit Exchanges, where all inputs and outputs are connected to other exchanges.
*&quot;SDH Add–Drop Multiplexer&quot; – The SDH Add–Drop Multiplexer (ADM) can add or remove any multiplexed frame down to 1.544 Mb. Below this level, standard TDM can be performed. SDH ADMs can also perform the task of an SDH Crossconnect and are used in End Exchanges where the channels from subscribers are connected to the core PSTN network.

SDH network functions are connected using high-speed optic fibre. Optic fibre uses light pulses to transmit data and is therefore extremely fast. Modern optic fibre transmission makes use of wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) where signals transmitted across the fibre are transmitted at different wavelengths, creating additional channels for transmission. This increases the speed and capacity of the link, which in turn reduces both unit and total costs.

==Statistical version==

Statistical time-division multiplexing (STDM) is an advanced version of TDM in which both the address of the terminal and the data itself are transmitted together for better routing. Using STDM allows bandwidth to be split over one line. Many college and corporate campuses use this type of TDM to distribute bandwidth.

On a 10-Mbit line entering a network, STDM can be used to provide 178 terminals with a dedicated 56k connection (178 * 56k = 9.96 Mb). A more common use however is to only grant the bandwidth when that much is needed. STDM does not reserve a time slot for each terminal, rather it assigns a slot when the terminal is requiring data to be sent or received.

In its primary form, TDM is used for circuit mode communication with a fixed number of channels and constant bandwidth per channel. Bandwidth reservation distinguishes time-division multiplexing from statistical multiplexing such as statistical time-division multiplexing. In pure TDM, the time slots are recurrent in a fixed order and pre-allocated to the channels, rather than scheduled on a packet-by-packet basis.

In dynamic TDMA, a scheduling algorithm dynamically reserves a variable number of time slots in each frame to variable bit-rate data streams, based on the traffic demand of each data stream. Dynamic TDMA is used in:
* HIPERLAN/2
* Dynamic synchronous transfer mode
* IEEE 802.16a

Asynchronous time-division multiplexing (ATDM), is an alternative nomenclature in which STDM designates synchronous time-division multiplexing, the older method that uses fixed time slots.

<text>A time-domain reflectometer (TDR) is an electronic instrument used to determine the characteristics of electrical lines by observing reflected pulses. It can be used to characterize and locate faults in metallic cables (for example, twisted pair wire or coaxial cable),
and to locate discontinuities in a connector, printed circuit board, or any other electrical path.

== Description ==
A TDR measures reflections along a conductor. In order to measure those reflections, the TDR will transmit an incident signal onto the conductor and listen for its reflections. If the conductor is of a uniform impedance and is properly terminated, then there will be no reflections and the remaining incident signal will be absorbed at the far-end by the termination. Instead, if there are impedance variations, then some of the incident signal will be reflected back to the source. A TDR is similar in principle to radar.

The impedance of the discontinuity can be determined from the amplitude of the reflected signal. The distance to the reflecting impedance can also be determined from the time that a pulse takes to return. The limitation of this method is the minimum system rise time. The total rise time consists of the combined rise time of the driving pulse and that of the oscilloscope or sampler that monitors the reflections.

=== Method ===
The TDR analysis begins with the propagation of a step or impulse of energy into a system and the subsequent observation of the energy reflected by the system. By analyzing the magnitude, duration and shape of the reflected waveform, the nature of the impedance variation in the transmission system can be determined.

If a pure resistive load is placed on the output of the reflectometer and a step signal is applied, a step signal is observed on the display, and its height is a function of the resistance. The magnitude of the step produced by the resistive load may be expressed as a fraction of the input signal as given by:

formula_1

where formula_2 is the characteristic impedance of the transmission line.

=== Reflection ===
Generally, the reflections will have the same shape as the incident signal, but their sign and magnitude depend on the change in impedance level. If there is a step increase in the impedance, then the reflection will have the same sign as the incident signal; if there is a step decrease in impedance, the reflection will have the opposite sign. The magnitude of the reflection depends not only on the amount of the impedance change, but also upon the loss in the conductor.

The reflections are measured at the output/input to the TDR and displayed or plotted as a function of time. Alternatively, the display can be read as a function of cable length because the speed of signal propagation is almost constant for a given transmission medium.

Because of its sensitivity to impedance variations, a TDR may be used to verify cable impedance characteristics, splice and connector locations and associated losses, and estimate cable lengths.

=== Incident signal ===
TDRs use different incident signals. Some TDRs transmit a pulse along the conductor; the resolution of such instruments is often the width of the pulse. Narrow pulses can offer good resolution, but they have high frequency signal components that are attenuated in long cables. The shape of the pulse is often a half cycle sinusoid. For longer cables, wider pulse widths are used.

Fast rise time steps are also used. Instead of looking for the reflection of a complete pulse, the instrument is concerned with the rising edge, which can be very fast. A 1970s technology TDR used steps with a rise time of 25 ps.

Still other TDRs transmit complex signals and detect reflections with correlation techniques. See spread-spectrum time-domain reflectometry.

=== Variations and extensions ===
The equivalent device for optical fiber is an optical time-domain reflectometer.

Time-domain transmissometry (TDT) is an analogous technique that measures the transmitted (rather than reflected) impulse. Together, they provide a powerful means of analysing electrical or optical transmission media such as coaxial cable and optical fiber.

Variations of TDR exist. For example, spread-spectrum time-domain reflectometry (SSTDR) is used to detect intermittent faults in complex and high-noise systems such as aircraft wiring. Coherent optical time domain reflectometry (COTDR) is another variant, used in optical systems, in which the returned signal is mixed with a local oscillator and then filtered to reduce noise.

== Example traces ==
These traces were produced by a time-domain reflectometer made from common lab equipment connected to approximately of coaxial cable having a characteristic impedance of 50 ohms. The propagation velocity of this cable is approximately 66% of the speed of light in vacuum.

These traces were produced by a commercial TDR using a step waveform with a 25 ps risetime, a sampling head with a 35 ps risetime, and an SMA cable. The far end of the SMA cable was left open or connected to different adapters. It takes about 3 ns for the pulse to travel down the cable, reflect, and reach the sampling head. A second reflection (at about 6 ns) can be seen in some traces; it is due to the reflection seeing a small mismatch at the sampling head and causing another &quot;incident&quot; wave to travel down the cable.
== Explanation ==
If the far end of the cable is shorted, that is, terminated with an impedance of zero ohms, and when the rising edge of the pulse is launched down the cable, the voltage at the launching point &quot;steps up&quot; to a given value instantly and the pulse begins propagating in the cable towards the short. When the pulse encounters the short, no energy is absorbed at the far end. Instead, an inverted pulse reflects back from the short towards the launching end. It is only when this reflection finally reaches the launch point that the voltage at this point abruptly drops back to zero, signaling the presence of a short at the end of the cable. That is, the TDR has no indication that there is a short at the end of the cable until its emitted pulse can travel in the cable and the echo can return. It is only after this round-trip delay that the short can be detected by the TDR. With knowledge of the signal propagation speed in the particular cable-under-test, the distance to the short can be measured.

A similar effect occurs if the far end of the cable is an open circuit (terminated into an infinite impedance). In this case, though, the reflection from the far end is polarized identically with the original pulse and adds to it rather than cancelling it out. So after a round-trip delay, the voltage at the TDR abruptly jumps to twice the originally-applied voltage.

Perfect termination at the far end of the cable would entirely absorb the applied pulse without causing any reflection, rendering the determination of the actual length of the cable impossible. In practice, some small reflection is nearly always observed.

The magnitude of the reflection is referred to as the reflection coefficient or &quot;ρ&quot;. The coefficient ranges from 1 (open circuit) to −1 (short circuit). The value of zero means that there is no reflection. The reflection coefficient is calculated as follows:
formula_3
where &quot;Z&quot;o is defined as the characteristic impedance of the transmission medium and &quot;Z&quot;t is the impedance of the termination at the far end of the transmission line.

Any discontinuity can be viewed as a termination impedance and substituted as &quot;Z&quot;t. This includes abrupt changes in the characteristic impedance. As an example, a trace width on a printed circuit board doubled at its midsection would constitute a discontinuity. Some of the energy will be reflected back to the driving source; the remaining energy will be transmitted. This is also known as a scattering junction.

== Usage ==
Time domain reflectometers are commonly used for in-place testing of very long cable runs, where it is impractical to dig up or remove what may be a kilometers-long cable. They are indispensable for preventive maintenance of telecommunication lines, as TDRs can detect resistance on joints and connectors as they corrode, and increasing insulation leakage as it degrades and absorbs moisture, long before either leads to catastrophic failures. Using a TDR, it is possible to pinpoint a fault to within centimetres.

TDRs are also very useful tools for technical surveillance counter-measures, where they help determine the existence and location of wire taps. The slight change in line impedance caused by the introduction of a tap or splice will show up on the screen of a TDR when connected to a phone line.

TDR equipment is also an essential tool in the failure analysis of modern high-frequency printed circuit boards with signal traces crafted to emulate transmission lines. Observing reflections can detect any unsoldered pins of a ball grid array device. Short-circuited pins can also be detected similarly.

The TDR principle is used in industrial settings, in situations as diverse as the testing of integrated circuit packages to measuring liquid levels. In the former, the time domain reflectometer is used to isolate failing sites in the same. The latter is primarily limited to the process industry.

=== In level measurement ===
In a TDR-based level measurement device, the device generates an impulse that propagates down a thin waveguide (referred to as a probe) – typically a metal rod or a steel cable. When this impulse hits the surface of the medium to be measured, part of the impulse reflects back up the waveguide. The device determines the fluid level by measuring the time difference between when the impulse was sent and when the reflection returned. The sensors can output the analyzed level as a continuous analog signal or switch output signals. In TDR technology, the impulse velocity is primarily affected by the permittivity of the medium through which the pulse propagates, which can vary greatly by the moisture content and temperature of the medium. In many cases, this effect can be corrected without undue difficulty. In some cases, such as in boiling and/or high temperature environments, the correction can be difficult. In particular, determining the froth (foam) height and the collapsed liquid level in a frothy / boiling medium can be very difficult.

=== Used in anchor cables in dams ===
The Dam Safety Interest Group of CEA Technologies, Inc. (CEATI), a consortium of electrical power organizations, has applied Spread-spectrum time-domain reflectometry to identify potential faults in concrete dam anchor cables. The key benefit of Time Domain reflectometry over other testing methods is the non-destructive method of these tests.

=== Used in the earth and agricultural sciences ===

A TDR is used to determine moisture content in soil and porous media. Over the last two decades, substantial advances have been made measuring moisture in soil, grain, food stuff, and sediment. The key to TDR&#x27;s success is its ability to accurately determine the permittivity (dielectric constant) of a material from wave propagation, due to the strong relationship between the permittivity of a material and its water content, as demonstrated in the pioneering works of Hoekstra and Delaney (1974) and Topp et al. (1980). Recent reviews and reference work on the subject include, Topp and Reynolds (1998), Noborio (2001), Pettinellia et al. (2002), Topp and Ferre (2002) and Robinson et al. (2003). The TDR method is a transmission line technique, and determines apparent permittivity (Ka) from the travel time of an electromagnetic wave that propagates along a transmission line, usually two or more parallel metal rods embedded in soil or sediment. The probes are typically between 10 and 30 cm long and connected to the TDR via coaxial cable.

=== In geotechnical engineering ===
Time domain reflectometry has also been utilized to monitor slope movement in a variety of geotechnical settings, including highway cuts, rail beds, and open pit mines (Dowding &amp; O&#x27;Connor, 1984, 2000a, 2000b; Kane &amp; Beck, 1999). In TDR stability monitoring applications, a coaxial cable is installed in a vertical borehole passing through the region of concern. The electrical impedance at any point along a coaxial cable changes with deformation of the insulator between the conductors. A brittle grout surrounds the cable to translate earth movement into an abrupt cable deformation that shows up as a detectable peak in the reflectance trace. Until recently, the technique was relatively insensitive to small slope movements and could not be automated because it relied on human detection of changes in the reflectance trace over time. Farrington and Sargand (2004) developed a simple signal processing technique using numerical derivatives to extract reliable indications of slope movement from the TDR data much earlier than by conventional interpretation.

Another application of TDRs in geotechnical engineering is to determine the soil moisture content. This can be done by placing the TDRs in different soil layers and measuring the time of start of precipitation and the time that TDR indicates an increase in the soil moisture content. The depth of the TDR (d) is a known factor and the other is the time it takes the drop of water to reach that depth (&quot;t&quot;); therefore the speed of water infiltration (&quot;v&quot;) can be determined. This is a good method to assess the effectiveness of Best Management Practices (BMPs) in reducing stormwater surface runoff.

=== In semiconductor device analysis ===
Time domain reflectometry is used in semiconductor failure analysis as a non-destructive method for the location of defects in semiconductor device packages. The TDR provides an electrical signature of individual conductive traces in the device package, and is useful for determining the location of opens and shorts.

=== In aviation wiring maintenance ===
Time domain reflectometry, specifically spread-spectrum time-domain reflectometry is used on aviation wiring for both preventive maintenance and fault location. Spread spectrum time domain reflectometry has the advantage of precisely locating the fault location within thousands of miles of aviation wiring. Additionally, this technology is worth considering for real time aviation monitoring, as spread spectrum reflectometry can be employed on live wires.

This method has been shown to be useful to locating intermittent electrical faults.

Multi carrier time domain reflectometry (MCTDR) has also been identified as a promising method for embedded EWIS diagnosis or troubleshooting tools. Based on the injection of a multicarrier signal (respecting EMC and harmless for the wires), this smart technology provides information for the detection, localization and characterization of electrical defects (or mechanical defects having electrical consequences) in the wiring systems.
Hard fault (short, open circuit) or intermittent defects can be detected very quickly increasing the reliability of wiring systems and improving their maintenance.

<text>A time standard is a specification for measuring time: either the rate at which time passes or points in time or both. In modern times, several time specifications have been officially recognized as standards, where formerly they were matters of custom and practice. An example of a kind of time standard can be a time scale, specifying a method for measuring divisions of time. A standard for civil time can specify both time intervals and time-of-day.

Standardized time measurements are made using a clock to count periods of some period changes, which may be either the changes of a natural phenomenon or of an artificial machine.

Historically, time standards were often based on the Earth&#x27;s rotational period. From the late 18 century to the 19th century it was assumed that the Earth&#x27;s daily rotational rate was constant. Astronomical observations of several kinds, including eclipse records, studied in the 19th century, raised suspicions that the rate at which Earth rotates is gradually slowing and also shows small-scale irregularities, and this was confirmed in the early twentieth century. Time standards based on Earth rotation were replaced (or initially supplemented) for astronomical use from 1952 onwards by an &quot;ephemeris time&quot; standard based on the Earth&#x27;s orbital period and in practice on the motion of the Moon. The invention in 1955 of the caesium atomic clock has led to the replacement of older and purely astronomical time standards, for most practical purposes, by newer time standards based wholly or partly on atomic time.

Various types of second and day are used as the basic time interval for most time scales. Other intervals of time (minutes, hours, and years) are usually defined in terms of these two.

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;time&quot; is generally used for many close but different concepts, including:
* instant as an object – one point on the time axis. Being an object, it has no value;
** date as a quantity characterising an instant. As a quantity, it has a value which may be expressed in a variety of ways, for example &quot;2014-04-26T09:42:36,75&quot; in ISO standard format, or more colloquially such as &quot;today, 9:42 a.m.&quot;;
* time interval as an object – part of the time axis limited by two instants. Being an object, it has no value;
** duration as a quantity characterizing a time interval. As a quantity, it has a value, such as a number of minutes, or may be described in terms of the quantities (such as times and dates) of its beginning and end.
* chronology, an ordered sequence of events in the past. Chronologies can be put into chronological groups (periodization). One of the most important systems of periodization is the geologic time scale, which is a system of periodizing the events that shaped the Earth and its life. Chronology, periodization, and interpretation of the past are together known as the study of history.

== Definitions of the second ==
There have only ever been three definitions of the second: as a fraction of the day, as a fraction of an extrapolated year, and as the microwave frequency of a caesium atomic clock.

In early history, clocks were not accurate enough to track seconds. After the invention of mechanical clocks, the CGS system and MKS system of units both defined the second as of a mean solar day. MKS was adopted internationally during the 1940s.

In the late 1940s, quartz crystal oscillator clocks could measure time more accurately than the rotation of the Earth. Metrologists also knew that Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun (a year) was much more stable than Earth&#x27;s rotation. This led to the definition of ephemeris time and the tropical year, and the ephemeris second was defined as &quot;the fraction of the tropical year for 1900 January 0 at 12 hours ephemeris time&quot;. This definition was adopted as part of the International System of Units in 1960.

Most recently, atomic clocks have been developed that offer improved accuracy. Since 1967, the SI base unit for time is the SI second, defined as exactly &quot;the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom&quot; (at a temperature of 0 K and at mean sea level). The SI second is the basis of all atomic timescales, e.g. coordinated universal time, GPS time, International Atomic Time, etc.

== Current time standards ==

Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) is a coordinate time having its spatial origin at the center of Earth&#x27;s mass. TCG is a theoretical ideal, and any particular realization will have measurement error.

International Atomic Time (TAI) is the primary physically realized time standard. TAI is produced by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), and is based on the combined input of many atomic clocks around the world, each corrected for environmental and relativistic effects (both gravitational and because of speed, like in GNSS). TAI is not related to TCG directly but rather is a realization of Terrestrial Time (TT), a theoretical timescale that is a rescaling of TCG such that the time rate approximately matches proper time at mean sea level.

Universal Time (UT1) is the Earth Rotation Angle (ERA) linearly scaled to match historical definitions of mean solar time at 0° longitude. At high precision, Earth&#x27;s rotation is irregular and is determined from the positions of distant quasars using long baseline interferometry, laser ranging of the Moon and artificial satellites, as well as GPS satellite orbits.

Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is an atomic time scale designed to approximate UT1. UTC differs from TAI by an integral number of seconds. UTC is kept within 0.9 second of UT1 by the introduction of one-second steps to UTC, the &quot;leap second&quot;. To date these steps (and difference &quot;TAI-UTC&quot;) have always been positive.

The Global Positioning System broadcasts a very precise time signal worldwide, along with instructions for converting GPS time (GPST) to UTC. It was defined with a constant offset from TAI: GPST = TAI - 19 s. The GPS time standard is maintained independently but regularly synchronized with or from, UTC time.

Standard time or civil time in a time zone deviates a fixed, round amount, usually a whole number of hours, from some form of Universal Time, usually UTC. The offset is chosen such that a new day starts approximately while the Sun is crossing the nadir meridian. Alternatively the difference is not really fixed, but it changes twice a year by a round amount, usually one hour, see Daylight saving time.

Julian day number is a count of days elapsed since Greenwich mean noon on 1 January 4713 B.C., Julian proleptic calendar. The Julian Date is the Julian day number followed by the fraction of the day elapsed since the preceding noon. Conveniently for astronomers, this avoids the date skip during an observation night. Modified Julian day (MJD) is defined as MJD = JD - 2400000.5. An MJD day thus begins at midnight, civil date. Julian dates can be expressed in UT1, TAI, TT, etc. and so for precise applications the timescale should be specified, e.g. MJD 49135.3824 TAI.

Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB) is a coordinate time having its spatial origin at the center of mass of the Solar System, which is called the barycenter.

=== Conversions ===
Conversions between atomic time systems (TAI, GPST, and UTC) are for the most part exact. However, GPS time is a measured value as opposed to a computed &quot;paper&quot; scale. As such it may differ from UTC(USNO) by a few hundred nanoseconds, which in turn may differ from official UTC by as much as 26 nanoseconds. Conversions for UT1 and TT rely on published difference tables which are specified to 10 microseconds and 0.1 nanoseconds respectively.

Definitions:
# LS = TAI − UTC = leap seconds from USNO Table of Leap Seconds
# DUT1 = UT1 − UTC published in IERS Bulletins or U.S. Naval Observatory EO
# DTT = TT − TAI − 32.184 s published in BIPM&#x27;s TT(BIPM) tables.

TCG is linearly related to TT as: TCG − TT = LG × (JD − 2443144.5) × 86400 seconds, with the scale difference LG defined as 6.969290134 exactly.

TCB is a linear transformation of TDB and TDB differs from TT in small, mostly periodic terms. Neglecting these terms (on the order of 2 milliseconds for several millennia around the present epoch), TCB is related to TT by: TCB − TT = LB × (JD − 2443144.5) × 86400 seconds. The scale difference LB has been defined by the IAU to be 1.550519768e-08 exactly.

== Time standards based on Earth rotation ==
Apparent solar time or true solar time is based on the solar day, which is the period between one solar noon (passage of the real Sun across the meridian) and the next. A solar day is approximately 24 hours of mean time. Because the Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun is elliptical, and because of the obliquity of the Earth&#x27;s axis relative to the plane of the orbit (the ecliptic), the apparent solar day varies a few dozen seconds above or below the mean value of 24 hours. As the variation accumulates over a few weeks, there are differences as large as 16 minutes between apparent solar time and mean solar time (see Equation of time). However, these variations cancel out over a year. There are also other perturbations such as Earth&#x27;s wobble, but these are less than a second per year.

Sidereal time is time by the stars. A sidereal rotation is the time it takes the Earth to make one revolution with rotation to the stars, approximately 23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds. A mean solar day is about 3 minutes 56 seconds longer than a mean sidereal day, or more than a mean sidereal day. In astronomy, sidereal time is used to predict when a star will reach its highest point in the sky. For accurate astronomical work on land, it was usual to observe sidereal time rather than solar time to measure mean solar time, because the observations of &#x27;fixed&#x27; stars could be measured and reduced more accurately than observations of the Sun (in spite of the need to make various small compensations, for refraction, aberration, precession, nutation and proper motion). It is well known that observations of the Sun pose substantial obstacles to the achievement of accuracy in measurement. In former times, before the distribution of accurate time signals, it was part of the routine work at any observatory to observe the sidereal times of meridian transit of selected &#x27;clock stars&#x27; (of well-known position and movement), and to use these to correct observatory clocks running local mean sidereal time; but nowadays local sidereal time is usually generated by computer, based on time signals.

Mean solar time was a time standard used especially at sea for navigational purposes, calculated by observing apparent solar time and then adding to it a correction, the equation of time, which compensated for two known irregularities in the length of the day, caused by the ellipticity of the Earth&#x27;s orbit and the obliquity of the Earth&#x27;s equator and polar axis to the ecliptic (which is the plane of the Earth&#x27;s orbit around the sun). It has been superseded by Universal Time.

Greenwich Mean Time was originally mean time deduced from meridian observations made at the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO). The principal meridian of that observatory was chosen in 1884 by the International Meridian Conference to be the Prime Meridian. GMT either by that name or as &#x27;mean time at Greenwich&#x27; used to be an international time standard, but is no longer so; it was initially renamed in 1928 as Universal Time (UT) (partly as a result of ambiguities arising from the changed practice of starting the astronomical day at midnight instead of at noon, adopted as from 1 January 1925). UT1 is still in reality mean time at Greenwich. Today, GMT is a time zone but is still the legal time in the UK in winter (and as adjusted by one hour for summer time). But Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) (an atomic-based time scale which is always kept within 0.9 second of UT1) is in common actual use in the UK, and the name GMT is often used to refer to it. (See articles Greenwich Mean Time, Universal Time, Coordinated Universal Time and the sources they cite.)

Versions of Universal Time such as UT0 and UT2 have been defined but are no longer in use.

==Time standards for planetary motion calculations==
Ephemeris time (ET) and its successor time scales described below have all been intended for astronomical use, e.g. in planetary motion calculations, with aims including uniformity, in particular, freedom from irregularities of Earth rotation. Some of these standards are examples of dynamical time scales and/or of coordinate time scales. Ephemeris Time was from 1952 to 1976 an official time scale standard of the International Astronomical Union; it was a dynamical time scale based on the orbital motion of the Earth around the Sun, from which the ephemeris second was derived as a defined fraction of the tropical year. This ephemeris second was the standard for the SI second from 1956 to 1967, and it was also the source for calibration of the caesium atomic clock; its length has been closely duplicated, to within 1 part in 1010, in the size of the current SI second referred to atomic time. This Ephemeris Time standard was non-relativistic and did not fulfil growing needs for relativistic coordinate time scales. It was in use for the official almanacs and planetary ephemerides from 1960 to 1983, and was replaced in official almanacs for 1984 and after, by numerically integrated Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris DE200 (based on the JPL relativistic coordinate time scale Teph).

For applications at the Earth&#x27;s surface, ET&#x27;s official replacement was Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT), which maintained continuity with it. TDT is a uniform atomic time scale, whose unit is the SI second. TDT is tied in its rate to the SI second, as is International Atomic Time (TAI), but because TAI was somewhat arbitrarily defined at its inception in 1958 to be initially equal to a refined version of UT, TDT was offset from TAI, by a constant 32.184 seconds. The offset provided a continuity from Ephemeris Time to TDT. TDT has since been redefined as Terrestrial Time (TT).

For the calculation of ephemerides, Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) was officially recommended to replace ET. TDB is similar to TDT but includes relativistic corrections that move the origin to the barycenter, hence it is a dynamical time at the barycenter. TDB differs from TT only in periodic terms. The difference is at most 2 milliseconds. Deficiencies were found in the definition of TDB (though not affecting Teph), and TDB has been replaced by Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB) and Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG), and redefined to be JPL ephemeris time argument Teph, a specific fixed linear transformation of TCB. As defined, TCB (as observed from the Earth&#x27;s surface) is of divergent rate relative to all of ET, Teph and TDT/TT; and the same is true, to a lesser extent, of TCG. The ephemerides of Sun, Moon and planets in current widespread and official use continue to be those calculated at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (updated as from 2003 to DE405) using as argument Teph.

<text>A T-interface or T reference point is used for basic rate access in an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) environment. It is a User–network interface reference point that is characterized by a four-wire, 144 kbit/s (2B+D) user rate.

Other characteristics of a T-interface are:
* it accommodates the link access and transport layer function in the ISDN architecture
* it is located at the user premises
* it is distance sensitive to the servicing Network termination 1

<doc id="41802" wikidata="Q162641" url="?curid=41802" title="Total harmonic distortion">
<text>The total harmonic distortion (THD or THDi) is a measurement of the harmonic distortion present in a signal and is defined as the ratio of the sum of the powers of all harmonic components to the power of the fundamental frequency. Distortion factor, a closely related term, is sometimes used as a synonym.

In audio systems, lower distortion means that the components in a loudspeaker, amplifier or microphone or other equipment produce a more accurate reproduction of an audio recording.

In radio communications, devices with lower THD tend to produce less unintentional interference with other electronic devices. Since harmonic distortion can potentially widen the frequency spectrum of the output emissions from a device by adding signals at multiples of the input frequency, devices with high THD are less suitable in applications such as spectrum sharing and spectrum sensing.

In power systems, lower THD implies lower peak currents, less heating, lower electromagnetic emissions, and less core loss in motors. It is a key metric in the stability and quality of the U.S. electrical grid. IEEE Standard 519-2022 covers the recommended practice and requirements for harmonic control in electric power systems.

==Definitions and examples==
To understand a system with an input and an output, such as an audio amplifier, we start with an ideal system where the transfer function is linear and time-invariant. When a sinusoidal signal of frequency &quot;ω&quot; passes through a non-ideal, non-linear device, additional content is added at multiples &quot;nω&quot; (harmonics) of the original frequency. THD is a measure of that additional signal content not present in the input signal.

When the main performance criterion is the &quot;purity&quot; of the original sine wave (in other words, the contribution of the original frequency with respect to its harmonics), the measurement is most commonly defined as the ratio of the RMS amplitude of a set of higher harmonic frequencies to the RMS amplitude of the first harmonic, or fundamental frequency
:formula_1
where &quot;Vn&quot; is the RMS value of the &quot;n&quot;th harmonic voltage, and &quot;V&quot;1 is the RMS value of the fundamental component.

In practice, the THDF is commonly used in audio distortion specifications (percentage THD); however, THD is a non-standardized specification, and the results between manufacturers are not easily comparable. Since individual harmonic amplitudes are measured, it is required that the manufacturer disclose the test signal frequency range, level and gain conditions, and number of measurements taken. It is possible to measure the full 20 Hz–20 kHz range using a sweep (though distortion for a fundamental above 10 kHz is inaudible).

Measurements for calculating the THD are made at the output of a device under specified conditions. The THD is usually expressed in percent or in dB relative to the fundamental as distortion attenuation.

A variant definition uses the fundamental plus harmonics as the reference:
:formula_2
These can be distinguished as THDF (for &quot;fundamental&quot;), and THDR (for &quot;root mean square&quot;). THDR cannot exceed 100%. At low distortion levels, the difference between the two calculation methods is negligible. For instance, a signal with THDF of 10% has a very similar THDR of 9.95%. However, at higher distortion levels the discrepancy becomes large. For instance, a signal with THDF 266% has a THDR of 94%. A pure square wave with infinite harmonics has THDF of 48.3% and THDR of 43.5%.

Some use the term &quot;distortion factor&quot; as a synonym for THDR, while others use it as a synonym for THDF.

The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) also defines another term &quot;total harmonic factor&quot; for the &quot;ratio of the RMS value of the harmonic content of an alternating quantity to the RMS value of the quantity&quot; using a different equation.

==THD+N==
THD+N means total harmonic distortion plus noise. This measurement is much more common and more comparable between devices. It is usually measured by inputting a sine wave, notch-filtering the output, and comparing the ratio between the output signal with and without the sine wave:
:formula_3

Like the THD measurement, this is a ratio of RMS amplitudes and can be measured as THDF (bandpassed or calculated fundamental as the denominator) or, more commonly, as THDR (total distorted signal as the denominator).

A meaningful measurement must include the bandwidth of measurement. This measurement includes effects from ground-loop power-line hum, high-frequency interference, intermodulation distortion between these tones and the fundamental, and so on, in addition to harmonic distortion. For psychoacoustic measurements, a weighting curve is applied such as A-weighting or ITU-R BS.468, which is intended to accentuate what is most audible to the human ear, contributing to a more accurate measurement. A-weighting is a rough way to estimate the frequency sensitivity of every persons&#x27; ears, as it does not take into account the non-linear behavior of the ear. The loudness model proposed by Zwicker includes these complexities. The model is described in the German standard DIN45631

For a given input frequency and amplitude, THD+N is reciprocal to SINAD, provided that both measurements are made over the same bandwidth.

==Measurement==
The distortion of a waveform relative to a pure sinewave can be measured either by using a THD analyzer to analyse the output wave into its constituent harmonics and noting the amplitude of each relative to the fundamental; or by cancelling out the fundamental with a notch filter and measuring the remaining signal, which will be total aggregate harmonic distortion plus noise.

Given a sinewave generator of very low inherent distortion, it can be used as input to amplification equipment, whose distortion at different frequencies and signal levels can be measured by examining the output waveform.

There is electronic equipment both to generate sinewaves and to measure distortion; but a general-purpose digital computer equipped with a sound card can carry out harmonic analysis with suitable software. Different software can be used to generate sinewaves, but the inherent distortion may be too high for measurement of very low-distortion amplifiers.

=== Interpretation ===
For many purposes, different types of harmonics are not equivalent. For instance, crossover distortion at a given THD is much more audible than clipping distortion at the same THD, since the harmonics produced by crossover distortion are nearly as strong at higher-frequency harmonics, such as 10× to 20× the fundamental, as they are at lower-frequency harmonics like 3× or 5× the fundamental. Those harmonics appearing far away in frequency from a fundamental (desired signal) are not as easily masked by that fundamental. In contrast, at the onset of clipping, harmonics first appear at low-order frequencies and gradually start to occupy higher-frequency harmonics. A single THD number is therefore inadequate to specify audibility and must be interpreted with care. Taking THD measurements at different output levels would expose whether the distortion is clipping (which decreases with an decreasing level) or crossover (which stays constant with varying output level, and thus is a &quot;greater percentage&quot; of the sound produced at low volumes).

THD is a summation of a number of harmonics equally weighted, even though research performed decades ago identifies that lower-order harmonics are harder to hear at the same level, compared with higher-order ones. In addition, even-order harmonics are said to be generally harder to hear than odd-order. A number of methods have been developed to estimate the actual audibility of THD, used to quantify crossover distortion or loudspeaker rub and buzz, such as &quot;high-order harmonic distortion&quot; (HOHD) or &quot;higher harmonic distortion&quot; (HHD) which measures only the 10th and higher harmonics, or metrics that apply psychoacoustic loudness curves to the residual.

==Examples==
For many standard signals, the above criterion may be calculated analytically in a closed form. For example, a pure square wave has THDF equal to
:formula_4
The sawtooth signal possesses
:formula_5
The pure symmetrical triangle wave has
:formula_6
For the rectangular pulse train with the &quot;duty cycle&quot; &quot;μ&quot; (called sometimes the &quot;cyclic ratio&quot;), the THDF has the form
:formula_7
and logically, reaches the minimum (≈0.483) when the signal becomes symmetrical &quot;μ&quot; = 0.5, i.e. the pure square wave. Appropriate filtering of these signals may drastically reduce the resulting THD. For instance, the pure square wave filtered by the Butterworth low-pass filter of the second order (with the cutoff frequency set equal to the fundamental frequency) has THDF of 5.3%, while the same signal filtered by the fourth-order filter has THDF of 0.6%. However, analytic computation of the THDF for complicated waveforms and filters often represents a difficult task, and the resulting expressions may be quite laborious to obtain. For example, the closed-form expression for the THDF of the sawtooth wave filtered by the first-order Butterworth low-pass filter is simply
:formula_8
while that for the same signal filtered by the second-order Butterworth filter is given by a rather cumbersome formula
: formula_9
Yet, the closed-form expression for the THDF of the pulse train filtered by the &quot;p&quot;th-order Butterworth low-pass filter is even more complicated and has the following form:
: formula_10
where &quot;μ&quot; is the duty cycle, 0 &lt; &quot;μ&quot; &lt; 1, and
: formula_11

<text>In telecommunications networks, traffic intensity is a measure of the average occupancy of a server or resource during a specified period of time, normally a busy hour. It is measured in traffic units (erlangs) and defined as the ratio of the time during which a facility is cumulatively occupied to the time this facility is available for occupancy. 

In a digital network, the traffic intensity is:
:formula_1
where
:&quot;a&quot; is the average arrival rate of packets (e.g. in packets per second)
:&quot;L&quot; is the average packet length (e.g. in bits), and
:&quot;R&quot; is the transmission rate (e.g. bits per second)

A traffic intensity greater than one erlang means that the rate at which bits arrive exceeds the rate bits can be transmitted and queuing delay will grow without bound (if the traffic intensity stays the same). If the traffic intensity is less than one erlang, then the router can handle more average traffic. 

Telecommunication operators are vitally interested in traffic intensity, as it dictates the amount of equipment they must supply.

<doc id="41805" wikidata="Q954187" url="?curid=41805" title="Transceiver">
<text>In radio communication, a transceiver is an electronic device which is a combination of a radio &quot;trans&quot;mitter and a re&quot;ceiver&quot;, hence the name. It can both transmit and receive radio waves using an antenna, for communication purposes. These two related functions are often combined in a single device to reduce manufacturing costs. The term is also used for other devices which can both transmit and receive through a communications channel, such as &quot;optical transceivers&quot; which transmit and receive light in optical fiber systems, and &quot;bus transceivers&quot; which transmit and receive digital data in computer data buses.

Radio transceivers are widely used in wireless devices. One large use is in two-way radios, which are audio transceivers used for bidirectional person-to-person voice communication. Examples are cell phones, which transmit and receive the two sides of a phone conversation using radio waves to a cell tower, cordless phones in which both the phone handset and the base station have transceivers to communicate both sides of the conversation, and land mobile radio systems like walkie-talkies and CB radios. Another large use is in wireless modems in mobile networked computer devices such laptops, pads, and cellphones, which both transmit digital data to and receive data from a wireless router. Aircraft carry automated microwave transceivers called transponders which, when they are triggered by microwaves from an air traffic control radar, transmit a coded signal back to the radar to identify the aircraft. Satellite transponders in communication satellites receive digital telecommunication data from a satellite ground station, and retransmit it to another ground station.

==History==

The transceiver first appeared in the 1920s. Before then, receivers and transmitters were manufactured separately and devices that wanted to receive and transmit data required both components. Almost all amateur radio equipment today uses transceivers, but there is an active market for pure radio receivers, which are mainly used by shortwave listening operators.

===Analog===
Analog transceivers use frequency modulation to send and receive data. Although this technique limits the complexity of the data that can be broadcast, analog transceivers operate very reliably and are used in many emergency communication systems. They are also cheaper than digital transceivers, which makes them popular with the CB and HAM radio communities.

===Digital===
Digital transceivers send and receive binary data over radio waves. This allows more types of data to be broadcast, including video and encrypted communication, which is commonly used by police and fire departments. Digital transmissions tend to be clearer and more detailed than their analog counterparts. Many modern wireless devices operate on digital transmissions.

==Usage==
===Telephony===
In a wired telephone, the handset contains the transmitter (for speaking) and receiver (for listening). Despite being able to transmit and receive data, the whole unit is colloquially referred to as a &quot;receiver&quot;. On a mobile telephone or other radiotelephone, the entire unit is a transceiver for both audio and radio.

A cordless telephone uses an audio and radio transceiver for the handset, and a radio transceiver for the base station. If a speakerphone is included in a wired telephone base or in a cordless base station, the base also becomes an audio transceiver.

A modem is similar to a transceiver in that it sends and receives a signal, but a modem uses modulation and demodulation. It modulates the signal being transmitted and demodulates the signal being received.

===Ethernet===

Transceivers are called Medium Attachment Units (MAUs) in IEEE 802.3 documents and were widely used in 10BASE2 and 10BASE5 Ethernet networks. Fiber-optic gigabit, 10 Gigabit Ethernet, 40 Gigabit Ethernet, and 100 Gigabit Ethernet utilize GBIC, SFP, SFP+, QSFP, XFP, XAUI, CXP, and CFP transceiver systems.

==Regulation==

Because transceivers are capable of broadcasting information over airwaves, they are required to adhere to various regulations. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission oversees their use. Transceivers must meet certain standards and capabilities depending on their intended use, and manufacturers must comply with these requirements. However, transceivers can be modified by users to violate FCC regulations. For instance, they might be used to broadcast on a frequency or channel that they should not have access to. For this reason, the FCC monitors not only the production but also the use of these devices.

<text>In telecommunications, the term transmission block has the following meanings:

#A group of characters or bits transmitted as a block, unit, message, or packet. It usually includes additional encoded characters for error detection and correction.
#In data transmission, a group of records sent, processed, or recorded as a unit.

Some protocols require each transmission block to end with an end-of-message marker. This is often a control character such as End-of-Text (ETX), End-of-Transmission-Block (ETB), or End-of-Transmission (EOT).

Some protocols (especially those requiring ETX) require each transmission block to begin with a Start-of-Text character (STX).

<text>In telecommunications, a transmission level point (TLP) is a test point in an electronic circuit that is typically a transmission channel. At the TLP, a test signal may be introduced or measured. Various parameters, such as the power of the signal, noise, voltage levels, wave forms, may be measured at the TLP.

The nominal transmission level at a TLP is a function of system design and is an expression of the design gain or attenuation (loss).

Voice-channel transmission levels at test points are measured in decibel-milliwatts (dBm) at a frequency of ~1000 hertz.

The dBm is an absolute reference level measurement (see ) with respect to 1 mW power. When the nominal signal power is at the TLP, the test point is called a &quot;zero transmission level point&quot;, or &quot;zero-dBm TLP&quot;. The abbreviation dBm0 stands for the power in dBm measured at a zero transmission level point. The TLP is thus characterized by the relation:

:TLP = dBm — dBm0

The term &quot;TLP&quot; is commonly used as if it were a unit, preceded by the nominal level for the test point. For example, the expression &#x27; refers to a&#x27;. If for instance a signal is specified as -13 dBm0 at a particular point and -6 dBm is measured at that point, the TLP is +7 TLP.

The level at a TLP where an end instrument, such as a telephone set, is connected is usually specified as .

<doc id="41811" wikidata="Q693004" url="?curid=41811" title="Transmission line">
<text>In electrical engineering, a transmission line is a specialized cable or other structure designed to conduct electromagnetic waves in a contained manner. The term applies when the conductors are long enough that the wave nature of the transmission must be taken into account. This applies especially to radio-frequency engineering because the short wavelengths mean that wave phenomena arise over very short distances (this can be as short as millimetres depending on frequency). However, the theory of transmission lines was historically developed to explain phenomena on very long telegraph lines, especially submarine telegraph cables.

Transmission lines are used for purposes such as connecting radio transmitters and receivers with their antennas (they are then called feed lines or feeders), distributing cable television signals, trunklines routing calls between telephone switching centres, computer network connections and high speed computer data buses. RF engineers commonly use short pieces of transmission line, usually in the form of printed planar transmission lines, arranged in certain patterns to build circuits such as filters. These circuits, known as distributed-element circuits, are an alternative to traditional circuits using discrete capacitors and inductors.

==Overview==
Ordinary electrical cables suffice to carry low frequency alternating current (AC), such as mains power, which reverses direction 100 to 120 times per second, and audio signals. However, they are not generally used to carry currents in the radio frequency range, above about 30 kHz, because the energy tends to radiate off the cable as radio waves, causing power losses. Radio frequency currents also tend to reflect from discontinuities in the cable such as connectors and joints, and travel back down the cable toward the source. These reflections act as bottlenecks, preventing the signal power from reaching the destination. Transmission lines use specialized construction, and impedance matching, to carry electromagnetic signals with minimal reflections and power losses. The distinguishing feature of most transmission lines is that they have uniform cross sectional dimensions along their length, giving them a uniform impedance, called the &quot;characteristic impedance&quot;, to prevent reflections. Types of transmission line include parallel line (ladder line, twisted pair), coaxial cable, and planar transmission lines such as stripline and microstrip. The higher the frequency of electromagnetic waves moving through a given cable or medium, the shorter the wavelength of the waves. Transmission lines become necessary when the transmitted frequency&#x27;s wavelength is sufficiently short that the length of the cable becomes a significant part of a wavelength.

At frequencies of microwave and higher, power losses in transmission lines become excessive, and waveguides are used instead, which function as &quot;pipes&quot; to confine and guide the electromagnetic waves. Some sources define waveguides as a type of transmission line; however, this article will not include them.

==History==
Mathematical analysis of the behaviour of electrical transmission lines grew out of the work of James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, and Oliver Heaviside. In 1855, Lord Kelvin formulated a diffusion model of the current in a submarine cable. The model correctly predicted the poor performance of the 1858 trans-Atlantic submarine telegraph cable. In 1885, Heaviside published the first papers that described his analysis of propagation in cables and the modern form of the telegrapher&#x27;s equations.

==The four terminal model==


For the purposes of analysis, an electrical transmission line can be modelled as a two-port network (also called a quadripole), as follows:

In the simplest case, the network is assumed to be linear (i.e. the complex voltage across either port is proportional to the complex current flowing into it when there are no reflections), and the two ports are assumed to be interchangeable. If the transmission line is uniform along its length, then its behaviour is largely described by two parameters called &quot;characteristic impedance&quot;, symbol Z0 and &quot;propagation delay&quot;, symbol formula_1. Z0 is the ratio of the complex voltage of a given wave to the complex current of the same wave at any point on the line. Typical values of Z0 are 50 or 75 ohms for a coaxial cable, about 100 ohms for a twisted pair of wires, and about 300 ohms for a common type of untwisted pair used in radio transmission. Propagation delay is proportional to the length of the transmission line and is never less than the length divided by the speed of light. Typical delays for modern communication transmission lines vary from to .

When sending power down a transmission line, it is usually desirable that as much power as possible will be absorbed by the load and as little as possible will be reflected back to the source. This can be ensured by making the load impedance equal to Z0, in which case the transmission line is said to be &quot;matched&quot;.

Some of the power that is fed into a transmission line is lost because of its resistance. This effect is called &quot;ohmic&quot; or &quot;resistive&quot; loss (see ohmic heating). At high frequencies, another effect called &quot;dielectric loss&quot; becomes significant, adding to the losses caused by resistance. Dielectric loss is caused when the insulating material inside the transmission line absorbs energy from the alternating electric field and converts it to heat (see dielectric heating). The transmission line is modelled with a resistance (R) and inductance (L) in series with a capacitance (C) and conductance (G) in parallel. The resistance and conductance contribute to the loss in a transmission line.

The total loss of power in a transmission line is often specified in decibels per metre (dB/m), and usually depends on the frequency of the signal. The manufacturer often supplies a chart showing the loss in dB/m at a range of frequencies. A loss of 3 dB corresponds approximately to a halving of the power.

Propagation delay is often specified in units of nanoseconds per metre. While propagation delay usually depends on the frequency of the signal, transmission lines are typically operated over frequency ranges where the propagation delay is approximately constant.

==Telegrapher&#x27;s equations==

The telegrapher&#x27;s equations (or just telegraph equations) are a pair of linear differential equations which describe the voltage (formula_2) and current (formula_3) on an electrical transmission line with distance and time. They were developed by Oliver Heaviside who created the &quot;transmission line model&quot;, and are based on Maxwell&#x27;s equations.
The transmission line model is an example of the distributed-element model. It represents the transmission line as an infinite series of two-port elementary components, each representing an infinitesimally short segment of the transmission line:

* The distributed resistance formula_4 of the conductors is represented by a series resistor (expressed in ohms per unit length).
* The distributed inductance formula_5 (due to the magnetic field around the wires, self-inductance, etc.) is represented by a series inductor (in henries per unit length).
* The capacitance formula_6 between the two conductors is represented by a shunt capacitor (in farads per unit length).
* The conductance formula_7 of the dielectric material separating the two conductors is represented by a shunt resistor between the signal wire and the return wire (in siemens per unit length).

The model consists of an &quot;infinite series&quot; of the elements shown in the figure, and the values of the components are specified &quot;per unit length&quot; so the picture of the component can be misleading. formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, and formula_7 may also be functions of frequency. An alternative notation is to use formula_12, formula_13, formula_14 and formula_15 to emphasize that the values are derivatives with respect to length. These quantities can also be known as the primary line constants to distinguish from the secondary line constants derived from them, these being the propagation constant, attenuation constant and phase constant.

The line voltage formula_16 and the current formula_17 can be expressed in the frequency domain as

:formula_18

:formula_19

::(see differential equation, angular frequency ω and imaginary unit )

===Special case of a lossless line===
When the elements formula_4 and formula_7 are negligibly small the transmission line is considered as a lossless structure. In this hypothetical case, the model depends only on the formula_5 and formula_6 elements which greatly simplifies the analysis. For a lossless transmission line, the second order steady-state Telegrapher&#x27;s equations are:

:formula_24

:formula_25

These are wave equations which have plane waves with equal propagation speed in the forward and reverse directions as solutions. The physical significance of this is that electromagnetic waves propagate down transmission lines and in general, there is a reflected component that interferes with the original signal. These equations are fundamental to transmission line theory.

===General case of a line with losses===
In the general case the loss terms, formula_4 and formula_7, are both included, and the full form of the Telegrapher&#x27;s equations become:

:formula_28

:formula_29

where formula_30 is the (complex) propagation constant. These equations are fundamental to transmission line theory. They are also wave equations, and have solutions similar to the special case, but which are a mixture of sines and cosines with exponential decay factors. Solving for the propagation constant formula_30 in terms of the primary parameters formula_4, formula_5, formula_7, and formula_6 gives:

:formula_36

and the characteristic impedance can be expressed as

:formula_37

The solutions for formula_16 and formula_17 are:

:formula_40

:formula_41

The constants formula_42 must be determined from boundary conditions. For a voltage pulse formula_43, starting at formula_44 and moving in the positive formula_45 direction, then the transmitted pulse formula_46 at position formula_45 can be obtained by computing the Fourier Transform, formula_48, of formula_43, attenuating each frequency component by formula_50, advancing its phase by formula_51, and taking the inverse Fourier Transform. The real and imaginary parts of formula_30 can be computed as

:formula_53

:formula_54

with

:formula_55

:formula_56

the right-hand expressions holding when neither formula_5, nor formula_6, nor formula_59 is zero, and with

:formula_60

where atan2 is the everywhere-defined form of two-parameter arctangent function, with arbitrary value zero when both arguments are zero.

Alternatively, the complex square root can be evaluated algebraically, to yield:

:formula_61
and
:formula_62

with the plus or minus signs chosen opposite to the direction of the wave&#x27;s motion through the conducting medium. ( is usually negative, since formula_7 and formula_4 are typically much smaller than formula_65 and formula_66, respectively, so is usually positive. is always positive.)

===Special, low loss case===
For small losses and high frequencies, the general equations can be simplified: If formula_67 and formula_68 then

:formula_69

:formula_70

Since an advance in phase by formula_71 is equivalent to a time delay by formula_72, formula_73 can be simply computed as

:formula_74

===Heaviside condition===
The Heaviside condition is formula_75. 

If R, G, L, and C are constants that are &quot;not&quot; frequency dependent and the Heaviside condition is met, 
then waves travel down the transmission line without dispersion distortion.

==Input impedance of transmission line==
The characteristic impedance formula_76 of a transmission line is the ratio of the amplitude of a &quot;single&quot; voltage wave to its current wave. Since most transmission lines also have a reflected wave, the characteristic impedance is generally not the impedance that is measured on the line.

The impedance measured at a given distance formula_77 from the load impedance formula_78 may be expressed as

:formula_79,

where formula_30 is the propagation constant and formula_81 is the voltage reflection coefficient measured at the load end of the transmission line. Alternatively, the above formula can be rearranged to express the input impedance in terms of the load impedance rather than the load voltage reflection coefficient:

:formula_82.

===Input impedance of lossless transmission line===
For a lossless transmission line, the propagation constant is purely imaginary, formula_83, so the above formulas can be rewritten as
:formula_84

where formula_85 is the wavenumber.

In calculating formula_86 the wavelength is generally different &quot;inside&quot; the transmission line to what it would be in free-space. Consequently, the velocity factor of the material the transmission line is made of needs to be taken into account when doing such a calculation.

===Special cases of lossless transmission lines===
====Half wave length====
For the special case where formula_87 where n is an integer (meaning that the length of the line is a multiple of half a wavelength), the expression reduces to the load impedance so that
:formula_88

for all formula_89 This includes the case when formula_90, meaning that the length of the transmission line is negligibly small compared to the wavelength. The physical significance of this is that the transmission line can be ignored (i.e. treated as a wire) in either case.

====Quarter wave length====

For the case where the length of the line is one quarter wavelength long, or an odd multiple of a quarter wavelength long, the input impedance becomes
:formula_91

====Matched load====
Another special case is when the load impedance is equal to the characteristic impedance of the line (i.e. the line is &quot;matched&quot;), in which case the impedance reduces to the characteristic impedance of the line so that
:formula_92
for all formula_77 and all formula_94.

====Short====
For the case of a shorted load (i.e. formula_95), the input impedance is purely imaginary and a periodic function of position and wavelength (frequency)

:formula_96

====Open====

For the case of an open load (i.e. formula_97), the input impedance is once again imaginary and periodic

:formula_98

== Matrix parameters ==
The simulation of transmission lines embedded into larger systems generally utilize admittance parameters (Y matrix), impedance parameters (Z matrix), and/or scattering parameters (S matrix) that embodies the full transmission line model needed to support the simulation.

=== Admittance parameters ===
Admittance (Y) parameters may be defined by applying a fixed voltage to one port (V1) of a transmission line with the other end shorted to ground and measuring the resulting current running into each port (I1, I2) and computing the admittance on each port as a ratio of I/V The admittance parameter Y11 is I1/V1, and the admittance parameter Y12 is I2/V1. Since transmission lines are electrically passive and symmetric devices, Y12 = Y21, and Y11 = Y22.

For lossless and lossy transmission lines respectively, the Y parameter matrix is as follows:

formula_99

=== Impedance parameters ===
Impedance (Z) parameter may defines by applying a fixed current into one port (I1) of a transmission line with the other port open and measuring the resulting voltage on each port (V1, V2) and computing the impedance parameter Z11 is V1/I1, and the impedance parameter Z12 is V2/I1. Since transmission lines are electrically passive and symmetric devices, V12 = V21, and V11 = V22.

In the Y and Z matrix definitions, formula_100 and formula_101. Unlike ideal lumped 2 port elements (resistors, capacitors, inductors, etc.) which do not have defined Z parameters, transmission lines have an internal path to ground, which permits the definition of Z parameters.

For lossless and lossy transmission lines respectively, the Z parameter matrix is as follows:

formula_102

=== Scattering parameters ===
Scattering (S) matrix parameters model the electrical behavior of the transmission line with matched loads at each termination.

For lossless and lossy transmission lines respectively, the S parameter matrix is as follows, using standard hyperbolic to circular complex translations.

formula_103

=== Variable definitions ===
In all matrix parameters above, the following variable definitions apply:

formula_104 = characteristic impedance

Zp = port impedance, or termination impedance

formula_105 = the propagation constant per unit length

formula_106 = attenuation constant in nepers per unit length

formula_107 = wave number or phase constant radians per unit length

formula_59 = frequency radians / second

formula_109 = Speed of propagation

formula_94 = wave length in unit length

L = inductance per unit length

C = capacitance per unit length

formula_111 = effective dielectric constant

formula_112 = 299,792,458 meters / second = Speed of light in a vacuum

== Coupled transmission lines ==
Transmission lines may be placed in proximity to each other such that they electrically interact, such as two microstrip lines in close proximity. Such transmission lines are said to be coupled transmission lines. Coupled transmission lines are characterized by an even and odd mode analysis. The even mode is characterized by excitation of the two conductors with a signal of equal amplitude and phase. The odd mode is characterized by excitation with signals of equal and opposite magnitude. The even and odd modes each have their own characteristic impedances (Zoe, Zoo) and phase constants (formula_113). Lossy coupled transmission lines have their own even and odd mode attenuation constants (formula_114), which in turn leads to even and odd mode propagation constants (formula_115).

=== Coupled matrix parameters ===
Coupled transmission lines may be modeled using even and odd mode transmission line parameters defined in the prior paragraph as shown with ports 1 and 2 on the input and ports 3 and 4 on the output,

formula_116..

==Practical types==
===Coaxial cable===

Coaxial lines confine virtually all of the electromagnetic wave to the area inside the cable. Coaxial lines can therefore be bent and twisted (subject to limits) without negative effects, and they can be strapped to conductive supports without inducing unwanted currents in them.
In radio-frequency applications up to a few gigahertz, the wave propagates in the transverse electric and magnetic mode (TEM) only, which means that the electric and magnetic fields are both perpendicular to the direction of propagation (the electric field is radial, and the magnetic field is circumferential). However, at frequencies for which the wavelength (in the dielectric) is significantly shorter than the circumference of the cable other transverse modes can propagate. These modes are classified into two groups, transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) waveguide modes. When more than one mode can exist, bends and other irregularities in the cable geometry can cause power to be transferred from one mode to another.

The most common use for coaxial cables is for television and other signals with bandwidth of multiple megahertz. In the middle 20th century they carried long distance telephone connections.

===Planar lines===

Planar transmission lines are transmission lines with conductors, or in some cases dielectric strips, that are flat, ribbon-shaped lines. They are used to interconnect components on printed circuits and integrated circuits working at microwave frequencies because the planar type fits in well with the manufacturing methods for these components. Several forms of planar transmission lines exist.

====Microstrip====
A microstrip circuit uses a thin flat conductor which is parallel to a ground plane. Microstrip can be made by having a strip of copper on one side of a printed circuit board (PCB) or ceramic substrate while the other side is a continuous ground plane. The width of the strip, the thickness of the insulating layer (PCB or ceramic) and the dielectric constant of the insulating layer determine the characteristic impedance. Microstrip is an open structure whereas coaxial cable is a closed structure.

====Stripline====

A stripline circuit uses a flat strip of metal which is sandwiched between two parallel ground planes. The insulating material of the substrate forms a dielectric. The width of the strip, the thickness of the substrate and the relative permittivity of the substrate determine the characteristic impedance of the strip which is a transmission line.

====Coplanar waveguide====

A coplanar waveguide consists of a center strip and two adjacent outer conductors, all three of them flat structures that are deposited onto the same insulating substrate and thus are located in the same plane (&quot;coplanar&quot;). The width of the center conductor, the distance between inner and outer conductors, and the relative permittivity of the substrate determine the characteristic impedance of the coplanar transmission line.

===Balanced lines===

A balanced line is a transmission line consisting of two conductors of the same type, and equal impedance to ground and other circuits. There are many formats of balanced lines, amongst the most common are twisted pair, star quad and twin-lead.

====Twisted pair====

Twisted pairs are commonly used for terrestrial telephone communications. In such cables, many pairs are grouped together in a single cable, from two to several thousand. The format is also used for data network distribution inside buildings, but the cable is more expensive because the transmission line parameters are tightly controlled.

====Star quad====

Star quad is a four-conductor cable in which all four conductors are twisted together around the cable axis. It is sometimes used for two circuits, such as 4-wire telephony and other telecommunications applications. In this configuration each pair uses two non-adjacent conductors. Other times it is used for a single, balanced line, such as audio applications and 2-wire telephony. In this configuration two non-adjacent conductors are terminated together at both ends of the cable, and the other two conductors are also terminated together.

When used for two circuits, crosstalk is reduced relative to cables with two separate twisted pairs.

When used for a single, balanced line, magnetic interference picked up by the cable arrives as a virtually perfect common mode signal, which is easily removed by coupling transformers.

The combined benefits of twisting, balanced signalling, and quadrupole pattern give outstanding noise immunity, especially advantageous for low signal level applications such as microphone cables, even when installed very close to a power cable. The disadvantage is that star quad, in combining two conductors, typically has double the capacitance of similar two-conductor twisted and shielded audio cable. High capacitance causes increasing distortion and greater loss of high frequencies as distance increases.

====Twin-lead====

Twin-lead consists of a pair of conductors held apart by a continuous insulator. By holding the conductors a known distance apart, the geometry is fixed and the line characteristics are reliably consistent. It is lower loss than coaxial cable because the characteristic impedance of twin-lead is generally higher than coaxial cable, leading to lower resistive losses due to the reduced current. However, it is more susceptible to interference.

====Lecher lines====

Lecher lines are a form of parallel conductor that can be used at UHF for creating resonant circuits. They are a convenient practical format that fills the gap between lumped components (used at HF/VHF) and resonant cavities (used at UHF/SHF).

===Single-wire line===
Unbalanced lines were formerly much used for telegraph transmission, but this form of communication has now fallen into disuse. Cables are similar to twisted pair in that many cores are bundled into the same cable but only one conductor is provided per circuit and there is no twisting. All the circuits on the same route use a common path for the return current (earth return). There is a power transmission version of single-wire earth return in use in many locations.

==General applications==

===Signal transfer===

Electrical transmission lines are very widely used to transmit high frequency signals over long or short distances with minimum power loss. One familiar example is the down lead from a TV or radio aerial to the receiver.

=== Transmission line circuits ===

A large variety of circuits can also be constructed with transmission lines including impedance matching circuits, filters, power dividers and directional couplers.

====Stepped transmission line====
A stepped transmission line is used for broad range impedance matching. It can be considered as multiple transmission line segments connected in series, with the characteristic impedance of each individual element to be formula_117. The input impedance can be obtained from the successive application of the chain relation

:formula_118

where formula_119 is the wave number of the formula_120-th transmission line segment and formula_121 is the length of this segment, and formula_122 is the front-end impedance that loads the formula_120-th segment.
Because the characteristic impedance of each transmission line segment formula_117 is often different from the impedance formula_76 of the fourth, input cable (only shown as an arrow marked formula_76 on the left side of the diagram above), the impedance transformation circle is off-centred along the formula_45 axis of the Smith Chart whose impedance representation is usually normalized against formula_76.

==== Approximating lumped elements ====
At higher frequencies, the reactive parasitic effects of real world lumped elements, including inductors and capacitors, limits their usefulness. Therefore, it is sometimes useful to approximate the electrical characteristics of inductors and capacitors with transmission lines at the higher frequencies using Richards&#x27; Transformations and then substitute the transmission lines for the lumped elements.

More accurate forms of multimode high frequency inductor modeling with transmission lines exist for advanced designers.

===Stub filters===

If a short-circuited or open-circuited transmission line is wired in parallel with a line used to transfer signals from point A to point B, then it will function as a filter. The method for making stubs is similar to the method for using Lecher lines for crude frequency measurement, but it is &#x27;working backwards&#x27;. One method recommended in the RSGB&#x27;s radiocommunication handbook is to take an open-circuited length of transmission line wired in parallel with the feeder delivering signals from an aerial. By cutting the free end of the transmission line, a minimum in the strength of the signal observed at a receiver can be found. At this stage the stub filter will reject this frequency and the odd harmonics, but if the free end of the stub is shorted then the stub will become a filter rejecting the even harmonics.

Wideband filters can be achieved using multiple stubs. However, this is a somewhat dated technique. Much more compact filters can be made with other methods such as parallel-line resonators.

===Pulse generation===

Transmission lines are used as pulse generators. By charging the transmission line and then discharging it into a resistive load, a rectangular pulse equal in length to twice the electrical length of the line can be obtained, although with half the voltage. A Blumlein transmission line is a related pulse forming device that overcomes this limitation. These are sometimes used as the pulsed power sources for radar transmitters and other devices.

==Sound==

The theory of sound wave propagation is very similar mathematically to that of electromagnetic waves, so techniques from transmission line theory are also used to build structures to conduct acoustic waves; and these are called acoustic transmission lines.

<text>A transmission medium is a system or substance that can mediate the propagation of signals for the purposes of telecommunication. Signals are typically imposed on a wave of some kind suitable for the chosen medium. For example, data can modulate sound, and a transmission medium for sounds may be air, but solids and liquids may also act as the transmission medium. Vacuum or air constitutes a good transmission medium for electromagnetic waves such as light and radio waves. While a material substance is not required for electromagnetic waves to propagate, such waves are usually affected by the transmission media they pass through, for instance, by absorption or reflection or refraction at the interfaces between media. Technical devices can therefore be employed to transmit or guide waves. Thus, an optical fiber or a copper cable is used as transmission media.

Electromagnetic radiation can be transmitted through an optical medium, such as optical fiber, or through twisted pair wires, coaxial cable, or dielectric-slab waveguides. It may also pass through any physical material that is transparent to the specific wavelength, such as water, air, glass, or concrete. Sound is, by definition, the vibration of matter, so it requires a physical medium for transmission, as do other kinds of mechanical waves and heat energy. Historically, science incorporated various aether theories to explain the transmission medium. However, it is now known that electromagnetic waves do not require a physical transmission medium, and so can travel through the vacuum of free space. Regions of the insulative vacuum can become conductive for electrical conduction through the presence of free electrons, holes, or ions.

==Optical medium==
==Telecommunications==
A physical medium in data communications is the transmission path over which a signal propagates. Many different types of transmission media are used as communications channel.

In many cases, communication is in the form of electromagnetic waves. With guided transmission media, the waves are guided along a physical path; examples of guided media include phone lines, twisted pair cables, coaxial cables, and optical fibers. Unguided transmission media are methods that allow the transmission of data without the use of physical means to define the path it takes. Examples of this include microwave, radio or infrared. Unguided media provide a means for transmitting electromagnetic waves but do not guide them; examples are propagation through air, vacuum and seawater.

The term direct link is used to refer to the transmission path between two devices in which signals propagate directly from transmitters to receivers with no intermediate devices, other than amplifiers or repeaters used to increase signal strength. This term can apply to both guided and unguided media.

== Simplex versus duplex ==
A signal transmission may be simplex, half-duplex, or full-duplex.

In simplex transmission, signals are transmitted in only one direction; one station is a transmitter and the other is the receiver. In the half-duplex operation, both stations may transmit, but only one at a time. In full-duplex operation, both stations may transmit simultaneously. In the latter case, the medium is carrying signals in both directions at the same time.

== Types ==
In general, a transmission medium can be classified as
* &quot;linear&quot;, if different waves at any particular point in the medium can be superposed;
* &quot;bounded&quot;, if it is finite in extent, otherwise &quot;unbounded&quot;;
* &quot;uniform&quot; or &quot;homogeneous&quot;, if its physical properties are unchanged at different points;
* &quot;isotropic&quot;, if its physical properties are the same in different directions.

There are two main types of transmission media:
* &quot;guided media&quot;—waves are guided along a solid medium such as a transmission line;
* &quot;unguided media&quot;—transmission and reception are achieved by means of an antenna.

One of the most common physical media used in networking is copper wire. Copper wire to carry signals to long distances using relatively low amounts of power. The unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is eight strands of copper wire, organized into four pairs.

=== Guided media ===
==== Twisted pair ====

&quot;Twisted pair&quot; cabling is a type of wiring in which two conductors of a single circuit are twisted together for the purposes of improving electromagnetic compatibility. Compared to a single conductor or an untwisted balanced pair, a twisted pair reduces electromagnetic radiation from the pair and crosstalk between neighboring pairs and improves rejection of external electromagnetic interference. It was invented by Alexander Graham Bell.

==== Coaxial cable ====
&quot;Coaxial cable&quot;, or &quot;coax&quot; (pronounced ) is a type of electrical cable that has an inner conductor surrounded by a tubular insulating layer, surrounded by a tubular conducting shield. Many coaxial cables also have an insulating outer sheath or jacket. The term coaxial comes from the inner conductor and the outer shield sharing a geometric axis. Coaxial cable was invented by English physicist, engineer, and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, who patented the design in 1880.

Coaxial cable is a type of transmission line, used to carry high frequency electrical signals with low losses. It is used in such applications as telephone trunk lines, broadband internet networking cables, high-speed computer data busses, carrying cable television signals, and connecting radio transmitters and receivers to their antennas. It differs from other shielded cables because the dimensions of the cable and connectors are controlled to give a precise, constant conductor spacing, which is needed for it to function efficiently as a transmission line.

==== Optical fiber ====


&quot;Optical fiber&quot;, which has emerged as the most commonly used transmission medium for long-distance communications, is a thin strand of glass that guides light along its length. Four major factors favor optical fiber over copper: data rates, distance, installation, and costs. Optical fiber can carry huge amounts of data compared to copper. It can be run for hundreds of miles without the need for signal repeaters, in turn, reducing maintenance costs and improving the reliability of the communication system because repeaters are a common source of network failures. Glass is lighter than copper allowing for less need for specialized heavy-lifting equipment when installing long-distance optical fiber. Optical fiber for indoor applications cost approximately a dollar a foot, the same as copper.

Multimode and single mode are two types of commonly used optical fiber. Multimode fiber uses LEDs as the light source and can carry signals over shorter distances, about 2 kilometers. Single mode can carry signals over distances of tens of miles.

An &quot;optical fiber&quot; is a flexible, transparent fiber made by drawing glass (silica) or plastic to a diameter slightly thicker than that of a human hair. Optical fibers are used most often as a means to transmit light between the two ends of the fiber and find wide usage in fiber-optic communications, where they permit transmission over longer distances and at higher bandwidths (data rates) than electrical cables. Fibers are used instead of metal wires because signals travel along them with less loss; in addition, fibers are immune to electromagnetic interference, a problem from which metal wires suffer excessively. Fibers are also used for illumination and imaging, and are often wrapped in bundles so they may be used to carry light into, or images out of confined spaces, as in the case of a fiberscope. Specially designed fibers are also used for a variety of other applications, some of them being fiber optic sensors and fiber lasers.

Optical fibers typically include a core surrounded by a transparent cladding material with a lower index of refraction. Light is kept in the core by the phenomenon of total internal reflection which causes the fiber to act as a waveguide. Fibers that support many propagation paths or transverse modes are called multi-mode fibers, while those that support a single mode are called single-mode fibers (SMF). Multi-mode fibers generally have a wider core diameter and are used for short-distance communication links and for applications where high power must be transmitted. Single-mode fibers are used for most communication links longer than .

Being able to join optical fibers with low loss is important in fiber optic communication. This is more complex than joining electrical wire or cable and involves careful cleaving of the fibers, precise alignment of the fiber cores, and the coupling of these aligned cores. For applications that demand a permanent connection a fusion splice is common. In this technique, an electric arc is used to melt the ends of the fibers together. Another common technique is a mechanical splice, where the ends of the fibers are held in contact by mechanical force. Temporary or semi-permanent connections are made by means of specialized optical fiber connectors.

The field of applied science and engineering concerned with the design and application of optical fibers is known as fiber optics. The term was coined by Indian physicist Narinder Singh Kapany, who is widely acknowledged as the father of fiber optics.

=== Unguided transmission media ===
==== Radio ====
&quot;Radio propagation&quot; is the behavior of radio waves as they travel, or are propagated, from one point to another, or into various parts of the atmosphere. As a form of electromagnetic radiation, like light waves, radio waves are affected by the phenomena of reflection, refraction, diffraction, absorption, polarization, and scattering. Understanding the effects of varying conditions on radio propagation has many practical applications, from choosing frequencies for international shortwave broadcasters, to designing reliable mobile telephone systems, to radio navigation, to operation of radar systems.

Different types of propagation are used in practical radio transmission systems. Line-of-sight propagation means radio waves that travel in a straight line from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. Line of sight transmission is used to medium-range radio transmission such as cell phones, cordless phones, walkie-talkies, wireless networks, FM radio and television broadcasting and radar, and satellite communication, such as satellite television. Line-of-sight transmission on the surface of the Earth is limited to the distance to the visual horizon, which depends on the height of transmitting and receiving antennas. It is the only propagation method possible at microwave frequencies and above. At microwave frequencies, moisture in the atmosphere (rain fade) can degrade transmission.

At lower frequencies in the MF, LF, and VLF bands, due to diffraction radio waves can bend over obstacles like hills, and travel beyond the horizon as surface waves which follow the contour of the Earth. These are called ground waves. AM broadcasting stations use ground waves to cover their listening areas. As the frequency gets lower, the attenuation with distance decreases, so very low frequency (VLF) and extremely low frequency (ELF) ground waves can be used to communicate worldwide. VLF and ELF waves can penetrate significant distances through water and earth, and these frequencies are used for mine communication and military communication with submerged submarines.

At medium wave and shortwave frequencies (MF and HF bands) radio waves can refract from a layer of charged particles (ions) high in the atmosphere, called the ionosphere. This means that radio waves transmitted at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth beyond the horizon, at great distances, even transcontinental distances. This is called skywave propagation. It is used by amateur radio operators to talk to other countries and shortwave broadcasting stations that broadcast internationally. Skywave communication is variable, dependent on conditions in the upper atmosphere; it is most reliable at night and in the winter. Due to its unreliability, since the advent of communication satellites in the 1960s, many long-range communication that previously used skywaves now use satellites.

In addition, there are several less common radio propagation mechanisms, such as tropospheric scattering (troposcatter) and near vertical incidence skywave (NVIS) which are used in specialized communication systems.

==Digital encoding==
Transmission and reception of data is typically performed in four steps:
# At the transmitting end, the data is encoded to a binary representation.
# A carrier signal is modulated as specified by the binary representation.
# At the receiving end, the carrier signal is demodulated into a binary representation.
# The data is decoded from the binary representation.

<text>In telecommunications, transmit-after-receive time delay is the time interval from removal of RF energy at the local receiver input until the local transmitter is automatically keyed on and the transmitted RF signal amplitude has increased to 90% of its steady-state value. &quot;An Exception:&quot; High-frequency (HF) transceiver equipment is normally not designed with an interlock between receiver squelch and transmitter on-off key. The transmitter can be keyed on at any time, independent of whether or not a signal is being received at the receiver input.

<doc id="41817" wikidata="Q849640" url="?curid=41817" title="Transponder">
<text>In telecommunications, a transponder is a device that, upon receiving a signal, emits a different signal in response. The term is a blend of &quot;transmitter&quot; and &quot;responder&quot;.

In air navigation or radio frequency identification, a flight transponder is an automated transceiver in an aircraft that emits a coded identifying signal in response to an interrogating received signal. 

In a communications satellite, a satellite transponder receives signals over a range of uplink frequencies, usually from a satellite ground station; the transponder amplifies them, and re-transmits them on a different set of downlink frequencies to receivers on Earth, often without changing the content of the received signal or signals.

==Satellite/broadcast communications==

A communications satellite’s channels are called transponders because each is a separate transceiver or repeater. With digital video data compression and multiplexing, several video and audio channels may travel through a single transponder on a single wideband carrier. Original analog video only has one channel per transponder, with subcarriers for audio and automatic transmission identification service (ATIS). Non-multiplexed radio stations can also travel in single channel per carrier (SCPC) mode, with multiple carriers (analog or digital) per transponder. This allows each station to transmit directly to the satellite, rather than paying for a whole transponder, or using landlines to send it to an earth station for multiplexing with other stations.

==Optical communications==
In fiber-optic communications, a transponder is the element that sends and receives the optical signal from a fiber. A transponder is typically characterized by its data rate and the maximum distance the signal can travel.

The term &quot;transponder&quot; can apply to different items with important functional differences, mentioned across academic and commercial literature:
* according to one description, a transponder and transceiver are both functionally similar devices that convert a full-duplex &quot;electrical&quot; signal into a full-duplex optical signal. The difference between the two is that transceivers interface electrically with the host system using a &quot;serial&quot; interface, whereas transponders use a &quot;parallel&quot; interface to do so. In this view, transponders provide easier-to-handle lower-rate parallel signals, but are bulkier and consume more power than transceivers.
* according to another description, transceivers are limited to providing an &quot;electrical-optical&quot; function only (not differentiating between serial or parallel electrical interfaces), whereas transponders convert an optical signal at one wavelength to an optical signal at another wavelength (typically ITU standardized for DWDM communication). As such, transponders can be considered as two transceivers placed back-to-back. This view also seems to be held by, for example, Fujitsu.

As a result, differences in transponder functionality also might influence the functional description of related optical modules like transceivers and muxponders.

==Aviation==


Another type of transponder occurs in identification friend or foe (IFF) systems in military aviation and in air traffic control secondary surveillance radar (beacon radar) systems for general aviation and commercial aviation. 

Primary radar works best with large all-metal aircraft, but not so well on small, composite aircraft. Its range is also limited by terrain and rain or snow and also detects unwanted objects such as automobiles, hills and trees. Furthermore, it cannot always estimate the altitude of an aircraft. Secondary radar overcomes these limitations but it depends on a transponder in the aircraft to respond to interrogations from the ground station to make the plane more visible.

Depending on the type of interrogation, the transponder sends back a transponder code (or &quot;squawk code&quot;, Mode A) or altitude information (Mode C) to help air traffic controllers to identify the aircraft and to maintain separation between planes. Another mode called Mode S (Mode Select) is designed to help avoiding over-interrogation of the transponder (having many radars in busy areas) and to allow automatic collision avoidance. Mode S transponders are backward compatible with Modes A and C. Mode S is mandatory in controlled airspace in many countries. Some countries have also required, or are moving toward requiring, that all aircraft be equipped with Mode S, even in uncontrolled airspace. However, in the field of general aviation there have been objections to these moves, because of the cost, size, limited benefit to the users in uncontrolled airspace, and, in the case of balloons and gliders, the power requirements during long flights.

Transponders are used on some military aircraft to ensure ground personnel can verify the functionality of a missile’s flight termination system prior to launch. Such radar-enhancing transponders are needed as the enclosed weapon bays on modern aircraft interfere with prelaunch, flight termination system verification performed by range safety personnel during training test launches. The transponders re-radiate the signals allowing for much longer communication distances.

===Marine===
The International Maritime Organization&#x27;s International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) requires the Automatic Identification System (AIS) to be fitted aboard international voyaging ships with , and all passenger ships regardless of size. AIS transmitters/receivers are generally called &quot;transponders&quot;, but they generally transmit autonomously, although coast stations can interrogate class B transponders on smaller vessels for additional information. In addition, navigational aids often have transponders called RACON (radar beacons) designed to make them stand out on a ship&#x27;s radar screen.

Sonar transponders operate under water and are used to measure distance and form the basis of underwater location marking, position tracking and navigation.
==Other applications==

===Electronic toll collection===
Electronic toll collection systems such as E-ZPass in the eastern United States use RFID transponders to identify vehicles.

===Lap timing===
Transponders are used in races for lap timing. A cable loop is dug into the race circuit near to the start/finish line. Each individual runner or car has an active transponder with a unique ID code. When the individual passes the start/finish line, the lap time and the racing position is shown on the score board.

Passive and active RFID systems are used in motor sports, and off-road events such as Enduro and Hare and Hounds racing, the riders have a transponder on their person, normally on their arm. When they complete a lap they swipe or touch the receiver which is connected to a computer and log their lap time.

NASCAR uses transponders and cable loops placed at numerous points around the track to determine the lineup during a caution period. This system replaced a dangerous race back to the start-finish line.

===Car keys===
Many modern automobiles have keys with transponders hidden inside the plastic head of the key. The user of the car may not even be aware that the transponder is there, because there are no buttons to press. When a key is inserted into the ignition lock cylinder and turned, the car&#x27;s computer sends a signal to the transponder. Unless the transponder replies with a valid code, the computer will not allow the engine to be started. Transponder keys have no battery; they are energized by the signal itself.
===Gated communities===
Transponders may also be used by residents to enter their gated communities. 
However, having more than one transponder causes problems. If a resident&#x27;s car with simple transponder is parked in the vicinity, any vehicle can come up to the automated gate, triggering the gate interrogation signal, which may get an acceptable response from the resident&#x27;s car. Such units properly installed might involve beamforming, unique transponders for each vehicle, or simply obliging vehicles to be stored away from the gate.

<text>In telecommunications, a transverse redundancy check (TRC) or vertical redundancy check is a redundancy check for synchronized parallel bits applied once per bit time, across the bit streams. This requires additional parallel channels for the check bit or bits.

The term usually applies to a single parity bit, although it could also be used to refer to a larger Hamming code.

The adjective &quot;transverse&quot; is most often used when it is used in combination with additional error control coding, such as a longitudinal redundancy check. Although parity alone can only detect and not correct errors, it can be part of a system for correcting errors.

An example of a TRC is the parity written to the 9th track of a 9-track tape.

<doc id="41821" wikidata="Q2067937" url="?curid=41821" title="Tree structure">
<text>A tree structure, tree diagram, or tree model is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form. It is named a &quot;tree structure&quot; because the classic representation resembles a tree, although the chart is generally upside down compared to a biological tree, with the &quot;stem&quot; at the top and the &quot;leaves&quot; at the bottom.

A tree structure is conceptual, and appears in several forms. For a discussion of tree structures in specific fields, see Tree (data structure) for computer science; insofar as it relates to graph theory, see tree (graph theory) or tree (set theory). Other related articles are listed below.

==Terminology and properties==
The tree elements are called &quot;nodes&quot;.
The lines connecting elements are called &quot;branches&quot;. 
Nodes without children are called leaf nodes, &quot;end-nodes&quot;, or &quot;leaves&quot;.

Every finite tree structure has a member that has no superior. This member is called the &quot;root&quot; or root node. The root is the starting node. But the converse is not true: infinite tree structures may or may not have a root node.

The names of relationships between nodes model the kinship terminology of family relations. The gender-neutral names &quot;parent&quot; and &quot;child&quot; have largely displaced the older &quot;father&quot; and &quot;son&quot; terminology. The term &quot;uncle&quot; is still widely used for other nodes at the same level as the parent, although it is sometimes replaced with gender-neutral terms like &quot;ommer&quot;.

* A node&#x27;s &quot;parent&quot; is a node one step higher in the hierarchy (i.e. closer to the root node) and lying on the same branch.
* &quot;Sibling&quot; (&quot;brother&quot; or &quot;sister&quot;) nodes share the same parent node.
* A node&#x27;s &quot;uncles&quot; (sometimes &quot;ommers&quot;) are siblings of that node&#x27;s parent.
* A node that is connected to all lower-level nodes is called an &quot;ancestor&quot;. The connected lower-level nodes are &quot;descendants&quot; of the ancestor node.

In the example, &quot;encyclopedia&quot; is the parent of &quot;science&quot; and &quot;culture&quot;, its children. &quot;Art&quot; and &quot;craft&quot; are siblings, and children of &quot;culture&quot;, which is their parent and thus one of their ancestors. Also, &quot;encyclopedia&quot;, as the root of the tree, is the ancestor of &quot;science&quot;, &quot;culture&quot;, &quot;art&quot; and &quot;craft&quot;. Finally, &quot;science&quot;, &quot;art&quot; and &quot;craft&quot;, as leaves, are ancestors of no other node.

Tree structures can depict all kinds of taxonomic knowledge, such as family trees, the biological evolutionary tree, the evolutionary tree of a language family, the grammatical structure of a language (a key example being S → NP VP, meaning a sentence is a noun phrase and a verb phrase, with each in turn having other components which have other components), the way web pages are logically ordered in a web site, mathematical trees of integer sets, et cetera.

The Oxford English Dictionary records use of both the terms &quot;tree structure&quot; and &quot;tree-diagram&quot; from 1965 in Noam Chomsky&#x27;s &quot;Aspects of the Theory of Syntax&quot;.

In a tree structure there is one and only one path from any point to any other point.

Computer science uses tree structures extensively (&quot;see&quot; Tree (data structure) and telecommunications.)

For a formal definition see set theory, and for a generalization in which children are not necessarily successors, see prefix order.

== Examples of tree structures ==

* Internet:
** usenet hierarchy
** Document Object Model&#x27;s logical structure, Yahoo! subject index, Curlie
* Operating system: directory structure
* Information management: Dewey Decimal System, PSH, this hierarchical bulleted list
* Management: hierarchical organizational structures
* Computer science:
** binary search tree
** red–black tree
** AVL tree
** R-tree
** doubly logarithmic tree
* Biology: evolutionary tree
* Business: pyramid selling scheme
* Project management: work breakdown structure
* Linguistics:
** (Syntax) Phrase structure trees
** (Historical Linguistics) Tree model of language change
* Sports: business chess, playoffs brackets
* Mathematics: Von Neumann universe
* Group theory: descendant trees

== Representing trees ==
There are many ways of visually representing tree structures.
Almost always, these boil down to variations, or combinations,
of a few basic styles:

=== Classical node-link diagrams ===
Classical node-link diagrams, that connect nodes together with line segments:


=== Nested sets ===
Nested sets that use enclosure or containment to show parenthood; examples include TreeMaps, fractal maps, and Euler diagrams:

=== Layered &quot;icicle&quot; diagrams ===
Layered &quot;icicle&quot; diagrams that use alignment/adjacency.


=== Outlines and tree views ===

Lists or diagrams that use indentation, sometimes called &quot;outlines&quot; or &quot;tree views&quot;.

An outline:

:encyclopedia
::culture
:::art
:::craft
::science

A tree view:
*encyclopedia
**culture
***art
***craft
**science


=== Nested parentheses ===

A correspondence to nested parentheses was first noticed by Sir Arthur Cayley:

((art,craft)culture,science)encyclopedia
or
encyclopedia(culture(art,craft),science)

=== Radial trees ===

Trees can also be represented radially:

<doc id="41822" wikidata="Q40631" url="?curid=41822" title="Troposphere">
<text>The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere of Earth. It contains 80% of the total mass of the planetary atmosphere and 99% of the total mass of water vapor and aerosols, and is where most weather phenomena occur. From the planetary surface of the Earth, the average height of the troposphere is in the tropics; in the middle latitudes; and in the high latitudes of the polar regions in winter; thus the average height of the troposphere is .

The term &quot;troposphere&quot; derives from the Greek words &quot;tropos&quot; (rotating) and &quot;sphaira&quot; (sphere) indicating that rotational turbulence mixes the layers of air and so determines the structure and the phenomena of the troposphere. The rotational friction of the troposphere against the planetary surface affects the flow of the air, and so forms the planetary boundary layer (PBL) that varies in height from hundreds of meters up to . The measures of the PBL vary according to the latitude, the landform, and the time of day when the meteorological measurement is realized. Atop the troposphere is the tropopause, which is the functional atmospheric border that demarcates the troposphere from the stratosphere. As such, because the tropopause is an inversion layer in which air-temperature increases with altitude, the temperature of the tropopause remains constant. The layer has the largest concentration of nitrogen.

==Structure==
===Composition===
The Earth&#x27;s planetary atmosphere contains, besides other gases, water vapour and carbon dioxide, which produce carbonic acid in rain water, which therefore has an approximate natural pH of 5.0 to 5.5 (slightly acidic). (Water other than atmospheric water vapour fallen as fresh rain, such as fresh/sweet/potable/river water, will usually be affected by the physical environment and may not be in this pH range.) Atmospheric water vapour holds suspended gasses in it (not by mass),78.08% nitrogen as N2, 20.95% oxygen as O2, 0.93% argon, trace gases, and variable amounts of condensing water (from saturated water vapor). Any carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from a pressurised source combines with the carbonic acid water vapour and momentarily reduces the atmospheric pH by negligible amounts. Respiration from animals releases out of equilibrium carbonic acid and low levels of other ions. Combustion of hydrocarbons which is not a chemical reaction releases to atmosphere carbonic acid water as; saturates, condensates, vapour or gas (invisible steam). Combustion can releases particulates (carbon/soot and ash) as well as molecules forming nitrites and sulphites which will reduce the atmospheric pH of the water slightly or harmfully in highly industrialised areas where this is classed as air pollution and can create the phenomena of acid rain, a pH lower than the natural pH5.56. The negative effects of the by-products of combustion released into the atmospheric vapour can be removed by the use of scrubber towers and other physical means, the captured pollutants can be processed into a valuable by-product. The sources of atmospheric water vapor are the bodies of water (oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, swamps), and vegetation on the planetary surface, which humidify the troposphere through the processes of evaporation and transpiration respectively, and which influences the occurrence of weather phenomena; the greatest proportion of water vapor is in the atmosphere nearest the surface of the Earth. The temperature of the troposphere decreases at high altitude by way of the inversion layers that occur in the tropopause, which is the atmospheric boundary that demarcates the troposphere from the stratosphere. At higher altitudes, the low air-temperature consequently decreases the saturation vapor pressure, the amount of atmospheric water vapor in the upper troposphere.

===Pressure===
The maximum air pressure (weight of the atmosphere) is at sea level and decreases at high altitude because the atmosphere is in hydrostatic equilibrium, wherein the air pressure is equal to the weight of the air above a given point on the planetary surface. The relation between decreased air pressure and high altitude can be equated to the density of a fluid, by way of the following hydrostatic equation:

:formula_1

where:

:*&quot;gn&quot; is the standard gravity
:*&quot;ρ&quot; is the density

:*&quot;z&quot; is the altitude
:*&quot;P&quot; is the pressure
:*&quot;R&quot; is the gas constant
:*&quot;T&quot; is the thermodynamic (absolute) temperature
:*&quot;m&quot; is the molar mass

===Temperature===
The planetary surface of the Earth heats the troposphere by means of latent heat, thermal radiation, and sensible heat.
The gas layers of the troposphere are less dense at the geographic poles and denser at the equator, where the average height of the tropical troposphere is 13 km, approximately 7.0 km greater than the 6.0 km average height of the polar troposphere at the geographic poles; therefore, surplus heating and vertical expansion of the troposphere occur in the tropical latitudes. At the middle latitudes, tropospheric temperatures decrease from an average temperature of at sea level to approximately at the tropopause. At the equator, the tropospheric temperatures decrease from an average temperature of at sea level to approximately at the tropopause. At the geographical poles, the Arctic and the Antarctic regions, the tropospheric temperature decreases from an average temperature of at sea level to approximately at the tropopause.

====Altitude====

The temperature of the troposphere decreases with increased altitude, and the rate of decrease in air temperature is measured with the Environmental Lapse Rate (formula_2) which is the numeric difference between the temperature of the planetary surface and the temperature of the tropopause divided by the altitude. Functionally, the ELR equation assumes that the planetary atmosphere is static, that there is no mixing of the layers of air, either by vertical atmospheric convection or winds that could create turbulence.

The difference in temperature derives from the planetary surface absorbing most of the energy from the sun, which then radiates outwards and heats the troposphere (the first layer of the atmosphere of Earth) while the radiation of surface heat to the upper atmosphere results in the cooling of that layer of the atmosphere. The ELR equation also assumes that the atmosphere is static, but heated air becomes buoyant, expands, and rises. The dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR) accounts for the effect of the expansion of dry air as it rises in the atmosphere, and the wet adiabatic lapse rate (WALR) includes the effect of the condensation-rate of water vapor upon the environmental lapse rate.

====Compression and expansion====
A parcel of air rises and expands because of the lower atmospheric pressure at high altitudes. The expansion of the air parcel pushes outwards against the surrounding air, and transfers energy (as work) from the parcel of air to the atmosphere. Transferring energy to a parcel of air by way of heat is a slow and inefficient exchange of energy with the environment, which is an adiabatic process (no energy transfer by way of heat). As the rising parcel of air loses energy while it acts upon the surrounding atmosphere, no heat energy is transferred from the atmosphere to the air parcel to compensate for the heat loss. The parcel of air loses energy as it reaches greater altitude, which is manifested as a decrease in the temperature of the air mass. Analogously, the reverse process occurs within a cold parcel of air that is being compressed and is sinking to the planetary surface.

The compression and the expansion of an air parcel are reversible phenomena in which energy is not transferred into or out of the air parcel; atmospheric compression and expansion are measured as an isentropic process (formula_3) wherein there occurs no change in entropy as the air parcel rises or falls within the atmosphere. Because the heat exchanged (formula_4) is related to the change in entropy (formula_5 by formula_6) the equation governing the air temperature as a function of altitude for a mixed atmosphere is: formula_7 where is the entropy. The isentropic equation states that atmospheric entropy does not change with altitude; the adiabatic lapse rate measures the rate at which temperature decreases with altitude under such conditions.

====Humidity====
If the air contains water vapor, then cooling of the air can cause the water to condense, and the air no longer functions as an ideal gas. If the air is at the saturation vapor pressure, then the rate at which temperature decreases with altitude is called the saturated adiabatic lapse rate. The actual rate at which the temperature decreases with altitude is the environmental lapse rate. In the troposphere, the average environmental lapse rate is a decrease of about 6.5 °C for every 1.0 km (1,000m) of increased altitude.
For dry air, an approximately ideal gas, the adiabatic equation is: formula_8 wherein formula_9 is the heat capacity ratio (formula_10) for air. The combination of the equation for the air pressure yields the dry adiabatic lapse rate:formula_11.

====Environment====
The environmental lapse rate (formula_12), at which temperature decreases with altitude, usually is unequal to the adiabatic lapse rate (formula_13). If the upper air is warmer than predicted by the adiabatic lapse rate (formula_14), then a rising and expanding parcel of air will arrive at the new altitude at a lower temperature than the surrounding air. In which case, the air parcel is denser than the surrounding air, and so falls back to its original altitude as an air mass that is stable against being lifted. If the upper air is cooler than predicted by the adiabatic lapse rate, then, when the air parcel rises to a new altitude, the air mass will have a higher temperature and a lower density than the surrounding air and will continue to accelerate and rise.

===Tropopause===

The tropopause is the atmospheric boundary layer between the troposphere and the stratosphere, and is located by measuring the changes in temperature relative to increased altitude in the troposphere and in the stratosphere. In the troposphere, the temperature of the air decreases at high altitude, however, in the stratosphere the air temperature initially is constant, and then increases with altitude. The increase of air temperature at stratospheric altitudes results from the ozone layer&#x27;s absorption and retention of the ultraviolet (UV) radiation that Earth receives from the Sun. The coldest layer of the atmosphere, where the temperature lapse rate changes from a positive rate (in the troposphere) to a negative rate (in the stratosphere) locates and identifies the tropopause as an inversion layer in which limited mixing of air layers occurs between the troposphere and the stratosphere.

==Atmospheric flow==
The general flow of the atmosphere is from west to east, which, however, can be interrupted by polar flows, either north-to-south flow or a south-to-north flow, which meteorology describes as a zonal flow and as a meridional flow. The terms are used to describe localized areas of the atmosphere at a synoptic scale; the three-cell model more fully explains the zonal and meridional flows of the planetary atmosphere of the Earth.

===Three-cell model===

The three-cell model of the atmosphere of the Earth describes the actual flow of the atmosphere with the tropical-latitude Hadley cell, the mid-latitude Ferrel cell, and the polar cell to describe the flow of energy and the circulation of the planetary atmosphere. Balance is the fundamental principle of the model — that the solar energy absorbed by the Earth in a year is equal to the energy radiated (lost) into outer space. The Earth&#x27;s energy balance does not equally apply to each latitude because of the varying strength of the sunlight that strikes each of the three atmospheric cells, consequent to the inclination of the axis of planet Earth within its orbit of the Sun. The resultant atmospheric circulation transports warm tropical air to the geographic poles and cold polar air to the tropics. The effect of the three cells is the tendency to the equilibrium of heat and moisture in the planetary atmosphere of Earth.

===Zonal flow===
A zonal flow regime is the meteorological term meaning that the general flow pattern is west to east along the Earth&#x27;s latitude lines, with weak shortwaves embedded in the flow. The use of the word &quot;zone&quot; refers to the flow being along the Earth&#x27;s latitudinal &quot;zones&quot;. This pattern can buckle and thus become a meridional flow.

===Meridional flow===
When the zonal flow buckles, the atmosphere can flow in a more longitudinal (or meridional) direction, and thus the term &quot;meridional flow&quot; arises. Meridional flow patterns feature strong, amplified troughs of low pressure and ridges of high pressure, with more north–south flow in the general pattern than west-to-east flow.

<text>In telecommunications, a tropospheric wave is a radio wave that travels via reflection in the troposphere. Trophospheric waves are propagated from a place of abrupt change in the dielectric constant, or its gradient. In some cases, a ground wave may be so altered that new components appear to arise from reflection in regions of rapidly changing dielectric constant. When these components are distinguishable from the other components, they are called &quot;tropospheric waves.&quot;

<doc id="41826" wikidata="Q5492632" url="?curid=41826" title="Trusted computing base">
<text>The trusted computing base (TCB) of a computer system is the set of all hardware, firmware, and/or software components that are critical to its security, in the sense that bugs or vulnerabilities occurring inside the TCB might jeopardize the security properties of the entire system. By contrast, parts of a computer system that lie outside the TCB must not be able to misbehave in a way that would leak any more privileges than are granted to them in accordance to the system&#x27;s security policy.

The careful design and implementation of a system&#x27;s trusted computing base is paramount to its overall security. Modern operating systems strive to reduce the size of the TCB so that an exhaustive examination of its code base (by means of manual or computer-assisted software audit or program verification) becomes feasible.

==Definition and characterization==
The term goes back to John Rushby, who defined it as the combination of operating system kernel and trusted processes. The latter refers to processes which are allowed to violate the system&#x27;s access-control rules.
In the classic paper &quot;Authentication in Distributed Systems: Theory and Practice&quot; Lampson et al. define the TCB of a computer system as simply
: &quot;a small amount of software and hardware that security depends on and that we distinguish from a much larger amount that can misbehave without affecting security.&quot;

Both definitions, while clear and convenient, are neither theoretically exact nor intended to be, as e.g. a network server process under a UNIX-like operating system might fall victim to a security breach and compromise an important part of the system&#x27;s security, yet is not part of the operating system&#x27;s TCB. The Orange Book, another classic computer security literature reference, therefore provides a more formal definition of the TCB of a computer system, as

: &quot;the totality of protection mechanisms within it, including hardware, firmware, and software, the combination of which is responsible for enforcing a computer security policy.&quot;

In other words, trusted computing base (TCB) is a combination of hardware, software, and controls that work together to form a trusted base to enforce your security policy.

The Orange Book further explains that

: &quot;[t]he ability of a trusted computing base to enforce correctly a unified security policy depends on the correctness of the mechanisms within the trusted computing base, the protection of those mechanisms to ensure their correctness, and the correct input of parameters related to the security policy.&quot;

In other words, a given piece of hardware or software is a part of the TCB if and only if it has been designed to be a part of the mechanism that provides its security to the computer system. In operating systems, this typically consists of the kernel (or microkernel) and a select set of system utilities (for example, setuid programs and daemons in UNIX systems). In programming languages designed with built-in security features, such as Java and E, the TCB is formed of the language runtime and standard library.

==Properties==

===Predicated upon the security policy===
As a consequence of the above Orange Book definition, the boundaries of the TCB depend closely upon the specifics of how the security policy is fleshed out. In the network server example above, even though, say, a Web server that serves a multi-user application is not part of the operating system&#x27;s TCB, it has the responsibility of performing access control so that the users cannot usurp the identity and privileges of each other. In this sense, it definitely is part of the TCB of the larger computer system that comprises the UNIX server, the user&#x27;s browsers and the Web application; in other words, breaching into the Web server through e.g. a buffer overflow may not be regarded as a compromise of the operating system proper, but it certainly constitutes a damaging exploit on the Web application.

This fundamental relativity of the boundary of the TCB is exemplified by the concept of the &#x27;target of evaluation&#x27; (&#x27;TOE&#x27;) in the Common Criteria security process: in the course of a Common Criteria security evaluation, one of the first decisions that must be made is the boundary of the audit in terms of the list of system components that will come under scrutiny.

===A prerequisite to security===
Systems that don&#x27;t have a trusted computing base as part of their design do not provide security of their own: they are only secure insofar as security is provided to them by external means (e.g. a computer sitting in a locked room without a network connection may be considered secure depending on the policy, regardless of the software it runs). This is because, as David J. Farber et al. put it, &quot;[i]n a computer system, the integrity of lower layers is typically treated as axiomatic by higher layers&quot;. As far as computer security is concerned, reasoning about the security properties of a computer system requires being able to make sound assumptions about what it can, and more importantly, cannot do; however, barring any reason to believe otherwise, a computer is able to do everything that a general Von Neumann machine can. This obviously includes operations that would be deemed contrary to all but the simplest security policies, such as divulging an email or password that should be kept secret; however, barring special provisions in the architecture of the system, there is no denying that the computer &quot;could be programmed&quot; to perform these undesirable tasks.

These special provisions that aim at preventing certain kinds of actions from being executed, in essence, constitute the trusted computing base. For this reason, the Orange Book (still a reference on the design of secure operating systems ) characterizes the various security assurance levels that it defines mainly in terms of the structure and security features of the TCB.

===Software parts of the TCB need to protect themselves===
As outlined by the aforementioned Orange Book, software portions of the trusted computing base need to protect themselves against tampering to be of any effect. This is due to the von Neumann architecture implemented by virtually all modern computers: since machine code can be processed as just another kind of data, it can be read and overwritten by any program. This can be prevented by special memory management provisions that subsequently have to be treated as part of the TCB. Specifically, the trusted computing base must at least prevent its own software from being written to.

In many modern CPUs, the protection of the memory that hosts the TCB is achieved by adding in a specialized piece of hardware called the memory management unit (MMU), which is programmable by the operating system to allow and deny a running program&#x27;s access to specific ranges of the system memory. Of course, the operating system is also able to disallow such programming to the other programs. This technique is called supervisor mode; compared to more crude approaches (such as storing the TCB in ROM, or equivalently, using the Harvard architecture), it has the advantage of allowing security-critical software to be upgraded in the field, although allowing secure upgrades of the trusted computing base poses bootstrap problems of its own.

===Trusted vs. trustworthy===
As stated above, trust in the trusted computing base is required to make any progress in ascertaining the security of the computer system. In other words, the trusted computing base is “trusted” first and foremost in the sense that it &quot;has&quot; to be trusted, and not necessarily that it is trustworthy. Real-world operating systems routinely have security-critical bugs discovered in them, which attests to the practical limits of such trust.

The alternative is formal software verification, which uses mathematical proof techniques to show the absence of bugs. Researchers at NICTA and its spinout Open Kernel Labs have recently performed such a formal verification of seL4, a member of the L4 microkernel family, proving functional correctness of the C implementation of the kernel.
This makes seL4 the first operating-system kernel which closes the gap between trust and trustworthiness, assuming the mathematical proof is free from error.

===TCB size===
Due to the aforementioned need to apply costly techniques such as formal verification or manual review, the size of the TCB has immediate consequences on the economics of the TCB assurance process, and the trustworthiness of the resulting product (in terms of the mathematical expectation of the number of bugs not found during the verification or review). In order to reduce costs and security risks, the TCB should therefore be kept as small as possible. This is a key argument in the debate preferring microkernels to monolithic kernels.

==Examples==
AIX materializes the trusted computing base as an optional component in its install-time package management system.

<doc id="41827" wikidata="Q1151244" url="?curid=41827" title="Turnkey">
<text>A turnkey, a turnkey project, or a turnkey operation (also spelled turn-key) is a type of project that is constructed so that it can be sold to any buyer as a completed product. This is contrasted with build to order, where the constructor builds an item to the buyer&#x27;s exact specifications, or when an incomplete product is sold with the assumption that the buyer would complete it.

A turnkey project or contract as described by Duncan Wallace (1984) is
A turnkey contract is typically a construction contract under which a contractor is employed to plan, design and build a project or an infrastructure and do any other necessary development to make it functional or ‘ready to use’ at an agreed price and by a fixed date.

In turnkey contracts, most of the time the employer provides the primary design. The contractor must follow the primary design provided by the employer.

A turnkey computer system is a complete computer including hardware, operating system and application(s) designed and sold to satisfy specific business requirements.

==Common usage==
&quot;Turnkey&quot; refers to something that is ready for immediate use, generally used in the sale or supply of goods or services. The word is a reference to the fact that the customer, upon receiving the product, just needs to turn the ignition key to make it operational, or that the key just needs to be turned over to the customer. &quot;Turnkey&quot; is commonly used in the construction industry, for instance, in which it refers to bundling of materials and labour by the home builder or general contractor to complete the home without owner involvement. The word is often used to describe a home built on the developer&#x27;s land with the developer&#x27;s financing ready for the customer to move in. If a contractor builds a &quot;turnkey home&quot; it frames the structure and finish the interior; everything is completed down to the cabinets and carpet. &quot;Turnkey&quot; is also commonly used in motorsports to describe a car being sold with powertrain (engine, transmission, etc.) to contrast with a vehicle sold without one so that other components may be re-used.

Similarly, this term may be used to advertise the sale of an established business, including all the equipment necessary to run it, or by a business-to-business supplier providing complete packages for business start-up. An example would be the creation of a &quot;turnkey hospital&quot; which would be building a complete medical.

In manufacturing, the turnkey manufacturing contractor (the business that takes on the turnkey project) normally provide help during the initial design process, machining and tooling, quality assurance, to production, packaging and delivery. Turnkey manufacturing have advantages in saving production time, single point of contact, cost savings and price certainty and quality assurance. 

==Specific usage==
The term &quot;turnkey&quot; is also often used in the technology industry, most commonly to describe pre-built computer &quot;packages&quot; in which everything needed to perform a certain type of task (e.g. audio editing) is put together by the supplier and sold as a bundle. This often includes a computer with pre-installed software, various types of hardware, and accessories. Such packages are commonly called appliances. A website with a ready-made solutions and some configurations is called a turnkey website.

In real estate, &quot;turnkey&quot; is defined as a home or property that is ready for occupation for its intended purpose, i.e., a home that is fully functional, needs no upgrading or repairs (move-in ready). In commercial use, a building set up to do auto repairs would be defined as turnkey if it came fully stocked with all needed machinery and tools for that particular trade. The turnkey process includes all of the steps involved to open a location including the site selection, negotiations, space planning, construction coordination and complete installation. &quot;Turnkey real estate&quot; also refers to a type of investment. This process includes the purchase, construction or rehab (of an existing site), the leasing out to tenants, and then the sale of the property to a buyer. The buyer is purchasing an investment property which is producing a stream of income.

In drilling, the term indicates an arrangement where a contractor must fully complete a well up to some milestone to receive any payment (in exchange for greater compensation upon completion).

<doc id="41828" wikidata="Q2778226" url="?curid=41828" title="Two-out-of-five code">
<text>A two-out-of-five code is a constant-weight code that provides exactly ten possible combinations of two bits, and is thus used for representing the decimal digits using five bits. Each bit is assigned a weight, such that the set bits sum to the desired value, with an exception for zero.

According to Federal Standard 1037C:
* each decimal digit is represented by a binary numeral consisting of five bits of which two are of one kind, called &quot;ones&quot;, and three are of the other kind, called &quot;zeros&quot;, and
* the usual weights assigned to the bit positions are 0-1-2-3-6. However, in this scheme, zero is encoded as binary &quot;01100&quot;; strictly speaking the 0-1-2-3-6 previously claimed is just a mnemonic device.

The weights give a unique encoding for most digits, but allow two encodings for 3: 0+3 or 10010 and 1+2 or 01100. The former is used to encode the digit 3, and the latter is used to represent the otherwise unrepresentable zero.

The IBM 7070, IBM 7072, and IBM 7074 computers used this code to represent each of the ten decimal digits in a machine word, although they numbered the bit positions 0-1-2-3-4, rather than with weights. Each word also had a sign flag, encoded using a two-out-of-three code, that could be A Alphanumeric, − Minus, or + Plus. When copied to a digit, the three bits were placed in bit positions 0-3-4. (Thus producing the numeric values 3, 6 and 9, respectively.)

A variant is the United States Postal Service POSTNET barcode, used to represent the ZIP Code for automated mail sorting and routing equipment. This uses two tall bars as ones and three short bars as zeros. Here, the weights assigned to the bit positions are 7-4-2-1-0. Again, zero is encoded specially, using the 7+4 combination (binary 11000) that would naturally encode 11. This method was also used in North American telephone multi-frequency and crossbar switching systems.

The USPS Postal Alpha Numeric Encoding Technique (PLANET) uses the same weights, but with the opposite bar-height convention.

The Code 39 barcode uses weights 1-2-4-7-0 (i.e. LSB first, Parity bit last) for the widths of its bars, but it also encodes two bits of extra information in the spacing between bars. The || ||| spacing is used for digits.

The following table represents decimal digits from 0 to 9 in various two-out-of-five code systems:

The requirement that exactly two bits be set is strictly stronger than a parity check; like all constant-weight codes, a two-out-of-five code can detect not only any single-bit error, but any unidirectional error -- cases in which all the individual bit errors are of a single type (all 0→1 or all 1→0).

<doc id="41829" wikidata="Q7860676" url="?curid=41829" title="NSA product types">
<text>The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) used to rank cryptographic products or algorithms by a certification called product types. Product types were defined in the National Information Assurance Glossary (CNSSI No. 4009, 2010) which used to define Type 1, 2, 3, and 4 products. The definitions of numeric type products have been removed from the government lexicon and are no longer used in government procurement efforts.

==Type 1 product==
A Type 1 product was a device or system certified by NSA for use in cryptographically securing classified U.S. Government information. A Type 1 product was defined as:

Cryptographic equipment, assembly or component classified or certified by NSA for encrypting and decrypting classified and sensitive national security information when appropriately keyed. Developed using established NSA business processes and containing NSA approved algorithms. Used to protect systems requiring the most stringent protection mechanisms.

They were available to U.S. Government users, their contractors, and federally sponsored non-U.S. Government activities subject to export restrictions in accordance with International Traffic in Arms Regulations.

Type 1 certification was a rigorous process that included testing and formal analysis of (among other things) cryptographic security, functional security, tamper resistance, emissions security (EMSEC/TEMPEST), and security of the product manufacturing and distribution process.

==Type 2 product==
A Type 2 product was unclassified cryptographic equipment, assemblies, or components, endorsed by the NSA, for use in telecommunications and automated information systems for the protection of national security information, as defined as:

Cryptographic equipment, assembly, or component certified by NSA for encrypting or decrypting sensitive national security information when appropriately keyed. Developed using established NSA business processes and containing NSA approved algorithms. Used to protect systems requiring protection mechanisms exceeding best commercial practices including systems used for the protection of unclassified national security information.

==Type 3 product==
A Type 3 product was a device for use with Sensitive, But Unclassified (SBU) information on non-national security systems, defined as:

Unclassified cryptographic equipment, assembly, or component used, when appropriately keyed, for encrypting or decrypting unclassified sensitive U.S. Government or commercial information, and to protect systems requiring protection mechanisms consistent with standard commercial practices. Developed using established commercial standards and containing NIST approved cryptographic algorithms/modules or successfully evaluated by the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP).

<text>Telephony ( ) is the field of technology involving the development, application, and deployment of telecommunications services for the purpose of electronic transmission of voice, fax, or data, between distant parties. The history of telephony is intimately linked to the invention and development of the telephone.

Telephony is commonly referred to as the construction or operation of telephones and telephonic systems and as a system of telecommunications in which telephonic equipment is employed in the transmission of speech or other sound between points, with or without the use of wires. The term is also used frequently to refer to computer hardware, software, and computer network systems, that perform functions traditionally performed by telephone equipment. In this context the technology is specifically referred to as Internet telephony, or voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).

==Overview==
The first telephones were connected directly in pairs. Each user had a separate telephone wired to each locations to be reached. This quickly became inconvenient and unmanageable when users wanted to communicate with more than a few people. The invention of the telephone exchange provided the solution for establishing telephone connections with any other telephone in service in the local area. Each telephone was connected to the exchange at first with one wire, later one wire pair, the local loop. Nearby exchanges in other service areas were connected with trunk lines, and long-distance service could be established by relaying the calls through multiple exchanges.

Initially, exchange switchboards were manually operated by an attendant, commonly referred to as the &quot;switchboard operator&quot;. When a customer cranked a handle on the telephone, it activated an indicator on the board in front of the operator, who would in response plug the operator headset into that jack and offer service. The caller had to ask for the called party by name, later by number, and the operator connected one end of a circuit into the called party jack to alert them. If the called station answered, the operator disconnected their headset and completed the station-to-station circuit. Trunk calls were made with the assistance of other operators at other exchangers in the network.

Until the 1970s, most telephones were permanently wired to the telephone line installed at customer premises. Later, conversion to installation of jacks that terminated the inside wiring permitted simple exchange of telephone sets with telephone plugs and allowed portability of the set to multiple locations in the premises where jacks were installed. The inside wiring to all jacks was connected in one place to the wire drop which connects the building to a cable. Cables usually bring a large number of drop wires from all over a district access network to one wire center or telephone exchange. When a telephone user wants to make a telephone call, equipment at the exchange examines the dialed telephone number and connects that telephone line to another in the same wire center, or to a trunk to a distant exchange. Most of the exchanges in the world are interconnected through a system of larger switching systems, forming the public switched telephone network (PSTN).

In the second half of the 20th century, fax and data became important secondary applications of the network created to carry voices, and late in the century, parts of the network were upgraded with ISDN and DSL to improve handling of such traffic.

Today, telephony uses digital technology (digital telephony) in the provisioning of telephone services and systems. Telephone calls can be provided digitally, but may be restricted to cases in which the last mile is digital, or where the conversion between digital and analog signals takes place inside the telephone. This advancement has reduced costs in communication, and improved the quality of voice services. The first implementation of this, ISDN, permitted all data transport from end-to-end speedily over telephone lines. This service was later made much less important due to the ability to provide digital services based on the Internet protocol suite.

Since the advent of personal computer technology in the 1980s, computer telephony integration (CTI) has progressively provided more sophisticated telephony services, initiated and controlled by the computer, such as making and receiving voice, fax, and data calls with telephone directory services and caller identification. The integration of telephony software and computer systems is a major development in the evolution of office automation. The term is used in describing the computerized services of call centers, such as those that direct your phone call to the right department at a business you&#x27;re calling. It is also sometimes used for the ability to use your personal computer to initiate and manage phone calls (in which case you can think of your computer as your personal call center).

== Digital telephony==
Digital telephony is the use of digital electronics in the operation and provisioning of telephony systems and services. Since the late 20th century, a digital core network has replaced the traditional analog transmission and signaling systems, and much of the access network has also been digitized.

Starting with the development of transistor technology, originating from Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1947, to amplification and switching circuits in the 1950s, the public switched telephone network (PSTN) has gradually moved towards solid-state electronics and automation. Following the development of computer-based electronic switching systems incorporating metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) and pulse-code modulation (PCM) technologies, the PSTN gradually evolved towards the digitization of signaling and audio transmissions. Digital telephony has since dramatically improved the capacity, quality and cost of the network. Digitization allows wideband voice on the same channel, with improved quality of a wider analog voice channel.

===History===
The earliest end-to-end analog telephone networks to be modified and upgraded to transmission networks with Digital Signal 1 (DS1/T1) carrier systems date back to the early 1960s. They were designed to support the basic 3 kHz voice channel by sampling the bandwidth-limited analog voice signal and encoding using pulse-code modulation (PCM). Early PCM codec-filters were implemented as passive resistorcapacitorinductor filter circuits, with analog-to-digital conversion (for digitizing voices) and digital-to-analog conversion (for reconstructing voices) handled by discrete devices. Early digital telephony was impractical due to the low performance and high costs of early PCM codec-filters.

Practical digital telecommunication was enabled by the invention of the metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), which led to the rapid development and wide adoption of PCM digital telephony. In 1957, Frosch and Derick were able to manufacture the first silicon dioxide field effect transistors at Bell Labs, the first transistors in which drain and source were adjacent at the surface. Subsequently, a team demonstrated a working MOSFET at Bell Labs 1960. MOS technology was initially overlooked by Bell because they did not find it practical for analog telephone applications, before it was commercialized by Fairchild and RCA for digital electronics such as computers. 

MOS technology eventually became practical for telephone applications with the MOS mixed-signal integrated circuit, which combines analog and digital signal processing on a single chip, developed by former Bell engineer David A. Hodges with Paul R. Gray at UC Berkeley in the early 1970s. In 1974, Hodges and Gray worked with R.E. Suarez to develop MOS switched capacitor (SC) circuit technology, which they used to develop a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) chip, using MOS capacitors and MOSFET switches for data conversion. MOS analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and DAC chips were commercialized by 1974.

MOS SC circuits led to the development of PCM codec-filter chips in the late 1970s. The silicon-gate CMOS (complementary MOS) PCM codec-filter chip, developed by Hodges and W.C. Black in 1980, has since been the industry standard for digital telephony. By the 1990s, telecommunication networks such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN) had been largely digitized with very-large-scale integration (VLSI) CMOS PCM codec-filters, widely used in electronic switching systems for telephone exchanges, private branch exchanges (PBX) and key telephone systems (KTS); user-end modems; data transmission applications such as digital loop carriers, pair gain multiplexers, telephone loop extenders, integrated services digital network (ISDN) terminals, digital cordless telephones and digital cell phones; and applications such as speech recognition equipment, voice data storage, voice mail and digital tapeless answering machines. The bandwidth of digital telecommunication networks has been rapidly increasing at an exponential rate, as observed by Edholm&#x27;s law, largely driven by the rapid scaling and miniaturization of MOS technology.

Uncompressed PCM digital audio with 8-bit depth and 8kHz sample rate requires a bit rate of 64kbit/s, which was impractical for early digital telecommunication networks with limited network bandwidth. A solution to this issue was linear predictive coding (LPC), a speech coding data compression algorithm that was first proposed by Fumitada Itakura of Nagoya University and Shuzo Saito of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) in 1966. LPC was capable of audio data compression down to 2.4kbit/s, leading to the first successful real-time conversations over digital networks in the 1970s. LPC has since been the most widely used speech coding method. Another audio data compression method, a discrete cosine transform (DCT) algorithm called the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT), has been widely adopted for speech coding in voice-over-IP (VoIP) applications since the late 1990s.

The development of transmission methods such as SONET and fiber optic transmission further advanced digital transmission. Although analog carrier systems existed that multiplexed multiple analog voice channels onto a single transmission medium, digital transmission allowed lower cost and more channels multiplexed on the transmission medium. Today the end instrument often remains analog but the analog signals are typically converted to digital signals at the serving area interface (SAI), central office (CO), or other aggregation point. Digital loop carriers (DLC) and fiber to the x place the digital network ever closer to the customer premises, relegating the analog local loop to legacy status.

==IP telephony==
The field of technology available for telephony has broadened with the advent of new communication technologies. Telephony now includes the technologies of Internet services and mobile communication, including video conferencing.

The new technologies based on Internet Protocol (IP) concepts are often referred to separately as voice over IP (VoIP) telephony, also commonly referred to as IP telephony or Internet telephony. Unlike traditional phone service, IP telephony service is relatively unregulated by government. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates phone-to-phone connections, but says they do not plan to regulate connections between a phone user and an IP telephony service provider.

A specialization of digital telephony, Internet Protocol (IP) telephony involves the application of digital networking technology that was the foundation to the Internet to create, transmit, and receive telecommunications sessions over computer networks. Internet telephony is commonly known as voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), reflecting the principle, but it has been referred with many other terms. VoIP has proven to be a disruptive technology that is rapidly replacing traditional telephone infrastructure technologies. As of January 2005, up to 10% of telephone subscribers in Japan and South Korea have switched to this digital telephone service. A January 2005 &quot;Newsweek&quot; article suggested that Internet telephony may be &quot;the next big thing&quot;. As of 2006, many VoIP companies offer service to consumers and businesses.

A significant advancement in mobile telephony has been the integration of IP technologies into mobile networks, notably through Voice over LTE (VoLTE) and Voice over 5G (Vo5G). These technologies enable voice calls to be transmitted over the same IP-based infrastructure used for data services, offering improved call quality and faster connections compared to traditional circuit-switched networks. VoLTE and Vo5G are becoming the standard for mobile voice communication in many regions, as mobile operators transition to all-IP networks.

IP telephony uses an Internet connection and hardware IP phones, analog telephone adapters, or softphone computer applications to transmit conversations encoded as data packets. While one of the most common and cost-effective uses of IP telephony is through connections over WiFi hotspots, it is also employed on private networks and over other types of Internet connections, which may or may not have a direct link to the global telephone network.

==Social impact research==
Direct person-to-person communication includes non-verbal cues expressed in facial and other bodily articulation, that cannot be transmitted in traditional voice telephony. Video telephony restores such interactions to varying degrees. Social Context Cues Theory is a model to measure the success of different types of communication in maintaining the non-verbal cues present in face-to-face interactions. The research examines many different cues, such as the physical context, different facial expressions, body movements, tone of voice, touch and smell.

Various communication cues are lost with the usage of the telephone. The communicating parties are not able to identify the body movements, and lack touch and smell. Although this diminished ability to identify social cues is well known, Wiesenfeld, Raghuram, and Garud point out that there is a value and efficiency to the type of communication for different tasks. They examine work places in which different types of communication, such as the telephone, are more useful than face-to-face interaction.

The expansion of communication to mobile telephone service has created a different filter of the social cues than the land-line telephone. The use of instant messaging, such as &quot;texting&quot;, on mobile telephones has created a sense of community. In &quot;The Social Construction of Mobile Telephony&quot; it is suggested that each phone call and text message is more than an attempt to converse. Instead, it is a gesture which maintains the social network between family and friends. Although there is a loss of certain social cues through telephones, mobile phones bring new forms of expression of different cues that are understood by different audiences. New language additives attempt to compensate for the inherent lack of non-physical interaction.

Another social theory supported through telephony is the Media Dependency Theory. This theory concludes that people use media or a resource to attain certain goals. This theory states that there is a link between the media, audience, and the large social system. Telephones, depending on the person, help attain certain goals like accessing information, keeping in contact with others, sending quick communication, entertainment, etc.

<doc id="41832" wikidata="Q507271" url="?curid=41832" title="U interface">
<text>The U interface or U reference point is a Basic Rate Interface (BRI) in the local loop of an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), connecting the network terminator (NT1/2) on the customer&#x27;s premises to the line termination (LT) in the carrier&#x27;s local exchange, in other words providing the connection from subscriber to central office.

Unlike the ISDN S/T interfaces, the U interface was not originally electrically defined by the ITU ISDN specifications, but left up to network operators to implement, although the ITU has issued recommendations G.960 and G.961 to formalize the standards adopted in the US and EU.

In the US, the U interface is originally defined by the ANSI T1.601 specification as a 2-wire connection using 2B1Q line coding. It is not as distance sensitive as the S interface or T interface, and can operate at distances up to 18,000 feet. Typically the U interface does not connect to terminal equipment (which typically has an S/T interface) but to an NT1 or NT2 (network terminator type 1 or 2.)

An NT1 is a discrete device that converts the U interface to an S/T interface, which is then connected to terminal equipment (TE) having an S/T interface. However, some TE devices integrate an NT1, and therefore have a direct U interface suitable for connection directly to the loop.

An NT2 is a more sophisticated local switching device such as a PBX, that may convert the signal to a different format or hand it off as S/T to terminal equipment.

In America, the NT1 is customer premises equipment (CPE) which is purchased and maintained by the user, which makes the U interface a User–network interface (UNI). The American variant is specified by ANSI T1.601.

In Europe, the NT1 belongs to the network operator, so the user doesn&#x27;t have direct access to the U interface. The European variant is specified by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in recommendation ETR 080. The ITU-T has issued recommendations G.960 and G.961 with world-wide scope, encompassing both the European and American variants of the U interface.

==Logical interface==
Like all other ISDN basic rate interfaces, the U interface carries two B (bearer) channels at 64 kbit/s and one D (data) channel at 16 kbit/s for a combined bitrate of 144 kbit/s (2B+D).

==Duplex transmission==
While in a four-wire interface such as the ISDN S and T-interfaces one wire pair is available for each direction of transmission, a two-wire interface needs to implement both directions on a single wire pair. To that end, ITU-T recommendation G.961 specifies two duplex transmission technologies for the ISDN U interface, either of which shall be used: Echo cancellation (ECH) and Time Compression Multiplex (TCM).

===Echo cancellation (ECH)===
When a transmitter applies a signal to the wire-pair, parts of the signal will be reflected as a result of imperfect balance of the hybrid and because of impedance discontinuities on the line. These reflections return to the transmitter as an echo and are indistinguishable from a signal transmitted at the far end. In the echo cancellation (ECH) scheme, the transmitter locally simulates the echo it expects to receive, and subtracts it from the received signal.

===Time Compression Multiplex (TCM)===

The Time Compression Multiplex (TCM) duplex method, also referred to as &quot;burst mode&quot;, solves the echo problem indirectly. The line is operated at a rate at least twice the signal rate and both ends of the line take turns transmitting, in a time-division duplex fashion.

==Line Systems==
ITU-T G.961 specifies four line systems for the ISDN U interface: MMS43, 2B1Q, TCM, and SU32. All line systems except TCM use echo cancellation for duplex operation. The American standard ANSI T1.601 specifies the 2B1Q line system, the European ETSI TR 080 recommendation specifies 2B1Q and MMS43.

===MMMS43 (4B3T)===

The Modified Monitoring State Code mapping 4 bits into 3 ternary symbols (MMS43), which is also referred to as 4B3T (four binary, three ternary) is a line system used in Europe and elsewhere in the world. 4B3T is a &quot;block code&quot; that uses Return-to-Zero states on the line. 4B3T converts each group of 4 data bits into 3 &quot;ternary&quot; line signal states (3 symbols). Echo cancellation techniques allow full-duplex operation on the line.

MMS43 is defined in Appendix I of G.961, Annex B of ETR 080, and other national standards, like Germany&#x27;s 1TR220. 4B3T can be transmitted reliably at up to over cable or up to over cable. An internal termination impedance of is presented to the line at each end of the U-interface.

A 1 ms frame carrying 144 bits of 2B+D data is mapped to 108 ternary symbols. These symbols are scrambled, with different scrambling codes for the two transmission directions, in order reduce correlation between transmitted and received signal. To this frame, an 11-symbol preamble and a symbol from the CL channel are added, yielding a frame size of 120 ternary symbols and a symbol rate of 120 kilobaud. The CL channel is used to request activation or deactivation of a loopback in either the NT1 or a line regenerator.

In 4B3T coding, there are three states presented to line: a positive pulse (+), a negative pulse (-), or a zero-state (no pulse: 0). An analogy here is that operation is similar to B8ZS or HDB3 in T1/E1 systems, except that there is an actual gain in the information rate by coding 24=16 possible binary states to one of 33=27 ternary states. This added redundancy is used to generate a zero DC-bias signal.

One requirement for line transmission is that there should be no DC build-up on the line, so the accumulated DC build-up is monitored and the codewords are chosen accordingly. Of the 16 binary information words, some are always mapped to a DC-component free (ternary) code word, while others can be mapped to either one of two code words, one with a positive and the other with a negative DC-component. In the latter case, the transmitter chooses whether to send the code-word with negative or positive DC-component based on the accumulated DC-offset.

===2B1Q===

2B1Q coding is the standard used in North America, Italy, and Switzerland. 2B1Q means that two bits are combined to form a single Quaternary line state (symbol). 2B1Q combines two bits at a time to be represented by one of four signal levels on the line. Echo cancellation techniques allow full-duplex operation on the line.

2B1Q coding is defined in Appendix II of G.961, ANSI T1.601, and Annex A of ETR 080. It can operate at distances up to about 18,000 feet () with loss up to . An internal termination impedance of 135 ohms is presented to the line at each end of the U-interface.

A 1.5 ms frame carrying 216 scrambled bits of 2B+D data is mapped to 108 quaternary symbols. To this frame, a 9-symbol preamble and 3 symbols from the CL channel are added, yielding a frame size of 120 quaternary symbols and a symbol rate of 80 kilobaud. The CL channel is used for communication between LT and NT1, a 12-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC), and various other physical layer functions. The CRC covers one 12 ms multiframe (8×1.5 ms frames).

===TCM / AMI===
The TCM / AMI ISDN line system, also referred to as TCM-ISDN, is used by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in its &quot;INS-Net 64&quot; service.

Appendix III of G.961 specifies a line system based on the Time Compression Multiplex (TCM) duplex method and an alternate mark inversion (AMI) line code. The AMI line code maps one input bit to one ternary symbol. Like with MMS43, the ternary symbol can either be a positive (+), zero (0), or negative (-) voltage. A 0 bit is represented by a zero voltage, while a 1 bit is alternatingly represented by a positive and a negative voltage, resulting in a DC-bias free signal. In a 2.5 ms interval, each side can send a 1.178 ms frame representing 360 bits of 2B+D data. To the 2B+D data, an 8-bit preamble, 8 bits from the CL channel, as well as a parity bit are added, yielding a frame size of 377 bits and a baud rate of 320 kilobaud. The CL channel is used for operations and maintenance, as well transmitting a 12-bit CRC covering 4 frames.

===SU32===
Appendix IV of G.961 specifies a line system based on echo cancellation and a substitutional 3B2T (SU32) line code, which maps three bits into 2 ternary symbols. As with MMS43 and AMI, the ternary symbol can either be a positive (+), zero (0), or negative (-) voltage. The mapping from 23=8 to 32=9 symbols leaves one unused symbol. When two subsequent input (binary) information words are identical, the (ternary) code word is substituted by the unused code word. A 0.75 ms frame carrying 108 bits of 2B+D data is mapped to 72 ternary symbols. To this frame, a 6-symbol preamble, one CRC symbol, and 2 symbols from the CL channel are added, yielding a frame size of 81 ternary symbols and a symbol rate of 108 kilobaud. The CL channel is used for supervisory and maintenance functions between the LT and NT1. The 15-bit CRC covers 16 frames.

<doc id="41834" wikidata="Q207696" url="?curid=41834" title="Uninterruptible power supply">
<text>An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) or uninterruptible power source is a type of continual power system that provides automated backup electric power to a load when the input power source or mains power fails. A UPS differs from a traditional auxiliary/emergency power system or standby generator in that it will provide near-instantaneous protection from input power interruptions by switching to energy stored in battery packs, supercapacitors or flywheels. The on-battery run-times of most UPSs are relatively short (only a few minutes) but sufficient to &quot;buy time&quot; for initiating a standby power source or properly shutting down the protected equipment. Almost all UPSs also contain integrated surge protection to shield the output appliances from voltage spikes.

A UPS is typically used to protect hardware such as computers, hospital equipment, data centers, telecommunications equipment or other electrical equipment where an unexpected power disruption could cause injuries, fatalities, serious business disruption or data loss. UPS units range in size from ones designed to protect a single computer (around 200 volt-ampere rating) to large units powering entire data centers or buildings.

==Common power problems==
The primary role of any UPS is to provide short-term power when the input power source fails. However, most UPS units are also capable in varying degrees of correcting common utility power problems:
# Voltage spike or sustained overvoltage
# Momentary or sustained reduction in input voltage
# Voltage sag
# Noise, defined as a high frequency transient or oscillation, usually injected into the line by nearby equipment
# Instability of the mains frequency
# Harmonic distortion, defined as a departure from the ideal sinusoidal waveform expected on the line

Some manufacturers of UPS units categorize their products in accordance with the number of power-related problems they address.

A UPS unit may also introduce problems with electric power quality. To prevent this, a UPS should be selected not only by capacity but also by the quality of power that is required by the equipment that is being supplied.

==Technologies==

The three general categories of modern UPS systems are &quot;on-line&quot;, &quot;line-interactive&quot; and &quot;standby&quot;:
* An online UPS uses a &quot;double conversion&quot; method of accepting AC input, rectifying to DC for passing through the rechargeable battery (or battery strings), then inverting back to 120 V/230 V AC for powering the protected equipment.
* A line-interactive UPS maintains the inverter in line and redirects the battery&#x27;s DC current path from the normal charging mode to supplying current when power is lost.
* In a standby (&quot;off-line&quot;) system the load is powered directly by the input power and the backup power circuitry is only invoked when the utility power fails.
Most UPS below one kilovolt-ampere (1 kVA) are of the line-interactive or standby variety which are usually less expensive.

For large power units, dynamic uninterruptible power supplies (DUPS) are sometimes used. A synchronous motor/alternator is connected on the mains via a choke. Energy is stored in a flywheel. When the mains power fails, an eddy-current regulation maintains the power on the load as long as the flywheel&#x27;s energy is not exhausted. DUPS are sometimes combined or integrated with a diesel generator that is turned on after a brief delay, forming a diesel rotary uninterruptible power supply (DRUPS).

===Offline/standby===
The offline/standby UPS offers only the most basic features, providing surge protection and battery backup. The protected equipment is normally connected directly to incoming utility power. When the incoming voltage falls below or rises above a predetermined level the UPS turns on its internal DC-AC inverter circuitry, which is powered from an internal storage battery. The UPS then mechanically switches the connected equipment onto its DC-AC inverter output. The switch-over time can be as long as 25 milliseconds depending on the amount of time it takes the standby UPS to detect the lost utility voltage. The UPS will be designed to power certain equipment, such as a personal computer, without any objectionable dip or brownout to that device.

===Line-interactive===
The line-interactive UPS is similar in operation to a standby UPS but with the addition of a multi-tap variable-voltage autotransformer. This is a special type of transformer that can add or subtract powered coils of wire, thereby increasing or decreasing the magnetic field and the output voltage of the transformer. This may also be performed by a &quot;buck–boost transformer&quot; which is distinct from an autotransformer, since the former may be wired to provide galvanic isolation.

This type of UPS is able to tolerate continuous undervoltage brownouts and overvoltage surges without consuming the limited reserve battery power. It instead compensates by automatically selecting different power taps on the autotransformer. Depending on the design, changing the autotransformer tap can cause a very brief output power disruption, which may cause UPSs equipped with a power-loss alarm to &quot;chirp&quot; for a moment.

This has become popular even in the cheapest UPSes because it takes advantage of components already included. The main 50/60 Hz transformer used to convert between line voltage and battery voltage needs to provide two slightly different turns ratios: One to convert the battery output voltage (typically a multiple of 12 V) to line voltage, and a second one to convert the line voltage to a slightly higher battery charging voltage (such as a multiple of 14 V). The difference between the two voltages is because charging a battery requires a delta voltage (up to 13–14 V for charging a 12 V battery). Furthermore, it is easier to do the switching on the line-voltage side of the transformer because of the lower currents on that side.

To gain the &quot;buck/boost&quot; feature, all that is required is two separate switches so that the AC input can be connected to one of the two primary taps, while the load is connected to the other, thus using the main transformer&#x27;s primary windings as an autotransformer. The battery can still be charged while &quot;bucking&quot; an overvoltage, but while &quot;boosting&quot; an undervoltage, the transformer output is too low to charge the batteries.

Autotransformers can be engineered to cover a wide range of varying input voltages, but this requires more taps and increases complexity, as well as the expense of the UPS. It is common for the autotransformer to cover a range only from about 90 V to 140 V for 120 V power, and then switch to battery if the voltage goes much higher or lower than that range.

In low-voltage conditions the UPS will use more current than normal, so it may need a higher current circuit than a normal device. For example, to power a 1000 W device at 120 V, the UPS will draw 8.33 A. If a brownout occurs and the voltage drops to 100 V, the UPS will draw 10 A to compensate. This also works in reverse, so that in an overvoltage condition, the UPS will need less current.

===Online/double-conversion===

In an online UPS, the batteries are always connected to the inverter, so that no power transfer switches are necessary. When power loss occurs, the rectifier simply drops out of the circuit and the batteries keep the power steady and unchanged. When power is restored, the rectifier resumes carrying most of the load and begins charging the batteries, though the charging current may be limited to prevent the high-power rectifier from damaging the batteries. The main advantage of an online UPS is its ability to provide an &quot;electrical firewall&quot; between the incoming utility power and sensitive electronic equipment.

The online UPS is ideal for environments where electrical isolation is necessary or for equipment that is very sensitive to power fluctuations. Although it was at one time reserved for very large installations of 10 kW or more, advances in technology have now permitted it to be available as a common consumer device, supplying 500 W or less. The online UPS may be necessary when the power environment is &quot;noisy&quot;, when utility power sags, outages and other anomalies are frequent, when protection of sensitive IT equipment loads is required, or when operation from an extended-run backup generator is necessary.

The basic technology of the online UPS is the same as in a standby or line-interactive UPS. However, it typically costs much more, due to it having a much greater current AC-to-DC battery-charger/rectifier, and with the rectifier and inverter designed to run continuously with improved cooling systems. It is called a &quot;double-conversion&quot; UPS due to the rectifier directly driving the inverter, even when powered from normal AC current.

Online UPS typically has a static transfer switch (STS) for increasing reliability.

== Other designs ==

===Hybrid topology/double conversion on demand===

These hybrid rotary UPS designs do not have official designations, although one name used by UTL is &quot;double conversion on demand&quot;. This style of UPS is targeted towards high-efficiency applications while still maintaining the features and protection level offered by double conversion.

A hybrid (double conversion on demand) UPS operates as an off-line/standby UPS when power conditions are within a certain preset window. This allows the UPS to achieve very high efficiency ratings. When the power conditions fluctuate outside of the predefined windows, the UPS switches to online/double-conversion operation. In double-conversion mode the UPS can adjust for voltage variations without having to use battery power, can filter out line noise and control frequency.

===Ferroresonant===

Ferroresonant units operate in the same way as a standby UPS unit; however, they are online with the exception that a ferroresonant transformer, is used to filter the output. This transformer is designed to hold energy long enough to cover the time between switching from line power to battery power and effectively eliminates the transfer time. Many ferroresonant UPSs are 82–88% efficient (AC/DC-AC) and offer excellent isolation.

The transformer has three windings, one for ordinary mains power, the second for rectified battery power, and the third for output AC power to the load.

This once was the dominant type of UPS and is limited to around the range. These units are still mainly used in some industrial settings (oil and gas, petrochemical, chemical, utility, and heavy industry markets) due to the robust nature of the UPS. Many ferroresonant UPSs utilizing controlled ferro technology may interact with power-factor-correcting equipment. This will result in fluctuating output voltage of the UPS, but may be corrected by reducing the load levels or adding other linear type loads.

===DC power===
A UPS designed for powering DC equipment is very similar to an online UPS, except that it does not need an output inverter. Also, if the UPS&#x27;s battery voltage is matched with the voltage the device needs, the device&#x27;s power supply will not be needed either. Since one or more power conversion steps are eliminated, this increases efficiency and run time.

Many systems used in telecommunications use an extra-low voltage &quot;common battery&quot; 48 V DC power, because it has less restrictive safety regulations, such as being installed in conduit and junction boxes. DC has typically been the dominant power source for telecommunications, and AC has typically been the dominant source for computers and servers.

There has been much experimentation with 48 V DC power for computer servers, in the hope of reducing the likelihood of failure and the cost of equipment. However, to supply the same amount of power, the current would be higher than an equivalent 115 V or 230 V circuit; greater current requires larger conductors or more energy lost as heat.

High voltage DC (380 V) is finding use in some data center applications and allows for small power conductors, but is subject to the more complex electrical code rules for safe containment of high voltages.

For lower power devices that run on 5 V, some portable battery banks can work as a UPS.

=== Rotary ===

A rotary UPS uses the inertia of a high-mass spinning flywheel (flywheel energy storage) to provide short-term ride-through in the event of power loss. The flywheel also acts as a buffer against power spikes and sags, since such short-term power events are not able to appreciably affect the rotational speed of the high-mass flywheel. It is also one of the oldest designs, predating vacuum tubes and integrated circuits.

It can be considered to be &quot;on line&quot; since it spins continuously under normal conditions. However, unlike a battery-based UPS, flywheel-based UPS systems typically provide 10 to 20 seconds of protection before the flywheel has slowed and power output stops. It is traditionally used in conjunction with standby generators, providing backup power only for the brief period of time the engine needs to start running and stabilize its output.

The rotary UPS is generally reserved for applications needing more than 10,000 W of protection, to justify the expense and benefit from the advantages rotary UPS systems bring. A larger flywheel or multiple flywheels operating in parallel will increase the reserve running time or capacity.

Because the flywheels are a mechanical power source, it is not necessary to use an electric motor or generator as an intermediary between it and a diesel engine designed to provide emergency power. By using a transmission gearbox, the rotational inertia of the flywheel can be used to directly start up a diesel engine, and once running, the diesel engine can be used to directly spin the flywheel. Multiple flywheels can likewise be connected in parallel through mechanical countershafts, without the need for separate motors and generators for each flywheel.

They are normally designed to provide very high current output compared to a purely electronic UPS, and are better able to provide inrush current for inductive loads such as motor startup or compressor loads, as well as medical MRI and cath lab equipment. It is also able to tolerate short-circuit conditions up to 17 times larger than an electronic UPS, permitting one device to blow a fuse and fail while other devices still continue to be powered from the rotary UPS.

Its life cycle is usually far greater than a purely electronic UPS, up to 30 years or more. But they do require periodic downtime for mechanical maintenance, such as ball bearing replacement. In larger systems, redundancy of the system ensures the availability of processes during this maintenance. Battery-based designs do not require downtime if the batteries can be hot-swapped, which is usually the case for larger units. Newer rotary units use technologies such as magnetic bearings and air-evacuated enclosures to increase standby efficiency and reduce maintenance to very low levels.

Typically, the high-mass flywheel is used in conjunction with a motor-generator system. These units can be configured as:
# A motor driving a mechanically connected generator,
# A combined synchronous motor and generator wound in alternating slots of a single rotor and stator,
# A hybrid rotary UPS, designed similar to an online UPS, except that it uses the flywheel in place of batteries. The rectifier drives a motor to spin the flywheel, while a generator uses the flywheel to power the inverter.

In case No. 3, the motor generator can be synchronous/synchronous or induction/synchronous. The motor side of the unit in case Nos. 2 and 3 can be driven directly by an AC power source (typically when in inverter bypass), a 6-step double-conversion motor drive, or a 6-pulse inverter. Case No. 1 uses an integrated flywheel as a short-term energy source instead of batteries to allow time for external, electrically coupled gensets to start and be brought online. Case Nos. 2 and 3 can use batteries or a free-standing electrically coupled flywheel as the short-term energy source.

==Form factors==

Smaller UPS systems come in several different forms and sizes. However, the two most common forms are tower and rack-mount.

Tower models stand upright on the ground or on a desk or shelf, and are typically used in network workstations or desktop computer applications. Rack-mount models can be mounted in standard 19-inch rack enclosures and can require anywhere from 1U to 12U (rack units). They are typically used in server and networking applications. Some devices feature user interfaces that rotate 90°, allowing the devices to be mounted vertically on the ground or horizontally as would be found in a rack.

==Applications==

===&quot;N&quot; + 1===
In large business environments where reliability is of great importance, a single huge UPS can also be a single point of failure that can disrupt many other systems. To provide greater reliability, multiple smaller UPS modules and batteries can be integrated together to provide redundant power protection equivalent to one very large UPS. &quot;&quot;N&quot; + 1&quot; means that if the load can be supplied by &quot;N&quot; modules, the installation will contain &quot;N&quot; + 1 modules. In this way, failure of one module will not impact system operation.

===Multiple redundancy===
Many computer servers offer the option of redundant power supplies, so that in the event of one power supply failing, one or more other power supplies are able to power the load. This is a critical point – each power supply must be able to power the entire server by itself.

Redundancy is further enhanced by plugging each power supply into a different circuit (i.e. to a different circuit breaker).

Redundant protection can be extended further yet by connecting each power supply to its own UPS. This provides double protection from both a power supply failure and a UPS failure, so that continued operation is assured. This configuration is also referred to as 1 + 1 or 2&quot;N&quot; redundancy. If the budget does not allow for two identical UPS units then it is common practice to plug one power supply into mains power and the other into the UPS.

===Outdoor use===
When a UPS system is placed outdoors, it should have some specific features that guarantee that it can tolerate weather without any effects on performance. Factors such as temperature, humidity, rain, and snow among others should be considered by the manufacturer when designing an outdoor UPS system. Operating temperature ranges for outdoor UPS systems could be around −40 °C to +55 °C.

Outdoor UPS systems can either be pole, ground (pedestal), or host mounted. Outdoor environment could mean extreme cold, in which case the outdoor UPS system should include a battery heater mat, or extreme heat, in which case the outdoor UPS system should include a fan system or an air conditioning system.
A solar inverter, or PV inverter, or solar converter, converts the variable direct current (DC) output of a photovoltaic (PV) solar panel into a utility frequency alternating current (AC) that can be fed into a commercial electrical grid or used by a local, off-grid electrical network. It is a critical BOS–component in a photovoltaic system, allowing the use of ordinary AC-powered equipment. Solar inverters have special functions adapted for use with photovoltaic arrays, including maximum power point tracking and anti-islanding protection.

== Harmonic distortion ==
The output of some electronic UPSes can have a significant departure from an ideal sinusoidal waveform. This is especially true of inexpensive consumer-grade single-phase units designed for home and office use. These often utilize simple switching AC power supplies and the output resembles a square wave rich in harmonics. These harmonics can cause interference with other electronic devices including radio communication, and some devices (e.g. inductive loads such as AC motors) may perform with reduced efficiency or not at all. More sophisticated (and expensive) UPS units can produce nearly pure sinusoidal AC power.

== Power factor ==
A problem in the combination of a double-conversion UPS and a generator is the voltage distortion created by the UPS. The input of a double-conversion UPS is essentially a big rectifier. The current drawn by the UPS is non-sinusoidal. This can cause the voltage from the AC mains or a generator to also become non-sinusoidal. The voltage distortion then can cause problems in all electrical equipment connected to that power source, including the UPS itself. It will also cause more power to be lost in the wiring supplying power to the UPS due to the spikes in current flow. This level of &quot;noise&quot; is measured as a percentage of &quot;total harmonic distortion of the current&quot; (THD&quot;I&quot;). Classic UPS rectifiers have a THD&quot;I&quot; level of around 25%–30%. To reduce voltage distortion, this requires heavier mains wiring or generators more than twice as large as the UPS.

There are several solutions to reduce the THD&quot;I&quot; in a double-conversion UPS:

Classic solutions such as passive filters reduce THD&quot;I&quot; to 5%–10% at full load. They are reliable, but big and only work at full load, and present their own problems when used in tandem with generators.

An alternative solution is an active filter. Through the use of such a device, THD&quot;I&quot; can drop to 5% over the full power range. The newest technology in double-conversion UPS units is a rectifier that does not use classic rectifier components (thyristors and diodes) but uses high-frequency components instead. A double-conversion UPS with an insulated-gate bipolar transistor rectifier and inductor can have a THD&quot;I&quot; as small as 2%. This completely eliminates the need to oversize the generator (and transformers), without additional filters, investment cost, losses, or space.

==Communication==
Power management (PM) requires:

# The UPS to report its status to the computer it powers via a communications link such as a serial port, Ethernet and Simple Network Management Protocol, GSM/GPRS or USB
# A subsystem in the OS that processes the reports and generates notifications, PM events, or commands an ordered shut down. Some UPS manufacturers publish their communication protocols, but other manufacturers (such as APC) use proprietary protocols.

The basic computer-to-UPS control methods are intended for one-to-one signaling from a single source to a single target. For example, a single UPS may connect to a single computer to provide status information about the UPS, and allow the computer to control the UPS. Similarly, the USB protocol is also intended to connect a single computer to multiple peripheral devices.

In some situations, it is useful for a single large UPS to be able to communicate with several protected devices. For traditional serial or USB control, a &quot;signal replication&quot; device may be used, which for example allows one UPS to connect to five computers using serial or USB connections. However, the splitting is typically only one direction from UPS to the devices to provide status information. Return control signals may only be permitted from one of the protected systems to the UPS.

As Ethernet has increased in common use since the 1990s, control signals are now commonly sent between a single UPS and multiple computers using standard Ethernet data communication methods such as TCP/IP. The status and control information is typically encrypted so that, for example, an outside hacker can not gain control of the UPS and command it to shut down.

Distribution of UPS status and control data requires that all intermediary devices such as Ethernet switches or serial multiplexers be powered by one or more UPS systems, in order for the UPS alerts to reach the target systems during a power outage. To avoid the dependency on Ethernet infrastructure, the UPSs can be connected directly to the main control server by using a GSM/GPRS channel also. The SMS or GPRS data packets sent from UPSs trigger software to shut down the PCs to reduce the load.

==Batteries==

There are three main types of UPS batteries: Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA), Flooded Cell or VLA batteries, and lithium-ion batteries.
The run-time for a battery-operated UPS depends on the type and size of batteries and rate of discharge, and the efficiency of the inverter. The total capacity of a lead–acid battery is a function of the rate at which it is discharged, which is described as Peukert&#x27;s law.

Manufacturers supply run-time rating in minutes for packaged UPS systems. Larger systems (such as for data centers) require detailed calculation of the load, inverter efficiency, and battery characteristics to ensure the required endurance is attained.

=== Common battery characteristics and load testing ===
When a lead–acid battery is charged or discharged, this initially affects only the reacting chemicals, which are at the interface between the electrodes and the electrolyte. With time, the charge stored in the chemicals at the interface, often called &quot;interface charge&quot;, spreads by diffusion of these chemicals throughout the volume of the active material.

If a battery has been completely discharged (e.g. the car lights were left on overnight) and next is given a fast charge for only a few minutes, then during the short charging time it develops only a charge near the interface. The battery voltage may rise to be close to the charger voltage so that the charging current decreases significantly. After a few hours, this interface charge will not spread to the volume of the electrode and electrolyte, leading to an interface charge so low that it may be insufficient to start a car.

Due to the interface charge, brief UPS &quot;self-test&quot; functions lasting only a few seconds may not accurately reflect the true runtime capacity of a UPS, and instead an extended &quot;recalibration&quot; or &quot;rundown&quot; test that deeply discharges the battery is needed.

The deep discharge testing is itself damaging to batteries due to the chemicals in the discharged battery starting to crystallize into highly stable molecular shapes that will not re-dissolve when the battery is recharged, permanently reducing charge capacity. In lead-acid batteries, this is known as sulfation, but deep-discharge damage also affects other types such as nickel-cadmium batteries and lithium batteries. Therefore, it is commonly recommended that rundown tests be performed infrequently, such as every six months to a year.

=== Testing of strings of batteries/cells ===
Multi-kilowatt commercial UPS systems with large and easily accessible battery banks are capable of isolating and testing individual cells within a &quot;battery string&quot;, which consists of either combined-cell battery units (such as 12 V lead acid batteries) or individual chemical cells wired in series. Isolating a single cell and installing a jumper in place of it allows the one battery to be discharge-tested, while the rest of the battery string remains charged and available to provide protection.

It is also possible to measure the electrical characteristics of individual cells in a battery string, using intermediate sensor wires that are installed at every cell-to-cell junction, and monitored both individually and collectively. Battery strings may also be wired as series-parallel, for example, two sets of 20 cells. In such a situation it is also necessary to monitor current flow between parallel strings, as current may circulate between the strings to balance out the effects of weak cells, dead cells with high resistance, or shorted cells. For example, stronger strings can discharge through weaker strings until voltage imbalances are equalized, and this must be factored into the individual inter-cell measurements within each string.

=== Series-parallel battery interactions ===
Battery strings wired in series-parallel can develop unusual failure modes due to interactions between the multiple parallel strings. Defective batteries in one string can adversely affect the operation and lifespan of good or new batteries in other strings. These issues also apply to other situations where series-parallel strings are used, not just in UPS systems but also in electric vehicle applications.

Consider a series-parallel battery arrangement with all good cells, and one becomes shorted or dead:
* The failed cell will reduce the maximum developed voltage for the entire series string it is within.
* Other series strings wired in parallel with the degraded string will now discharge through the degraded string until their voltage matches the voltage of the degraded string, potentially overcharging and leading to electrolyte boiling and outgassing from the remaining good cells in the degraded string. These parallel strings can now never be fully recharged, as the increased voltage will bleed off through the string containing the failed battery.
* Charging systems may attempt to gauge battery string capacity by measuring overall voltage. Due to the overall string voltage depletion due to the dead cells, the charging system may detect this as a state of discharge, and will continuously attempt to charge the series-parallel strings, which leads to continuous overcharging and damage to all the cells in the degraded series string containing the damaged battery.
* If lead-acid batteries are used, all cells in the formerly good parallel strings will begin to sulfate due to the inability for them to be fully recharged, resulting in the storage capacity of these cells being permanently damaged, even if the damaged cell in the one degraded string is eventually discovered and replaced with a new one.

The only way to prevent these subtle series-parallel string interactions is by not using parallel strings at all and using separate charge controllers and inverters for individual series strings.

=== Series new/old battery interactions ===
Even just a single string of batteries wired in series can have adverse interactions if new batteries are mixed with old batteries. Older batteries tend to have reduced storage capacity, and so will both discharge faster than new batteries and also charge to their maximum capacity more rapidly than new batteries.

As a mixed string of new and old batteries is depleted, the string voltage will drop, and when the old batteries are exhausted the new batteries still have charge available. The newer cells may continue to discharge through the rest of the string, but due to the low voltage this energy flow may not be useful and may be wasted in the old cells as resistance heating.

For cells that are supposed to operate within a specific discharge window, new cells with more capacity may cause the old cells in the series string to continue to discharge beyond the safe bottom limit of the discharge window, damaging the old cells.

When recharged, the old cells recharge more rapidly, leading to a rapid rise of voltage to near the fully charged state, but before the new cells with more capacity have fully recharged. The charge controller detects the high voltage of a nearly fully charged string and reduces current flow. The new cells with more capacity now charge very slowly, so slowly that the chemicals may begin to crystallize before reaching the fully charged state, reducing new cell capacity over several charge/discharge cycles until their capacity more closely matches the old cells in the series string.

For such reasons, some industrial UPS management systems recommend periodic replacement of entire battery arrays potentially using hundreds of expensive batteries, due to these damaging interactions between new batteries and old batteries, within and across series and parallel strings.

<text>Universal Time (UT or UT1) is a time standard based on Earth&#x27;s rotation. While originally it was mean solar time at 0° longitude, precise measurements of the Sun are difficult. Therefore, UT1 is computed from a measure of the Earth&#x27;s angle with respect to the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF), called the Earth Rotation Angle (ERA, which serves as the replacement for Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time). UT1 is the same everywhere on Earth. UT1 is required to follow the relationship
:ERA = 2π(0.7790572732640 + 1.00273781191135448&quot; · Tu&quot;) radians
where &quot;Tu&quot; = (Julian UT1 date − 2451545.0).

==History==
Prior to the introduction of standard time, each municipality throughout the clock-using world set its official clock, if it had one, according to the local position of the Sun (see solar time). This served adequately until the introduction of rail travel in Britain, which made it possible to travel fast enough over sufficiently long distances as to require continuous re-setting of timepieces as a train progressed in its daily run through several towns. Starting in 1847, Britain established Greenwich Mean Time, the mean solar time at Greenwich, England, to solve this problem: all clocks in Great Britain were set to this time regardless of local solar noon. Using telescopes, GMT was calibrated to the mean solar time at the prime meridian through the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. Chronometers or telegraphy were used to synchronize these clocks.
As international commerce increased, the need for an international standard of time measurement emerged. Several authors proposed a &quot;universal&quot; or &quot;cosmic&quot; time (see ). The development of Universal Time began at the International Meridian Conference. At the end of this conference, on 22 October 1884, the recommended base reference for world time, the &quot;universal day&quot;, was announced to be the local mean solar time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, counted from 0 hours at Greenwich mean midnight. This agreed with the civil Greenwich Mean Time used on the island of Great Britain since 1847. In contrast, astronomical GMT began at mean noon, i.e. astronomical day &quot;X&quot; began at noon of civil day &quot;X&quot;. The purpose of this was to keep one night&#x27;s observations under one date. The civil system was adopted as of 0 hours (civil) 1 January 1925. Nautical GMT began 24 hours before astronomical GMT, at least until 1805 in the Royal Navy, but persisted much later elsewhere because it was mentioned at the 1884 conference. Greenwich was chosen because by 1884 two-thirds of all nautical charts and maps already used it as their prime meridian.

During the period between 1848 and 1972, all of the major countries adopted time zones based on the Greenwich meridian.

In 1928, the term &quot;Universal Time&quot; (&quot;UT&quot;) was introduced by the International Astronomical Union to refer to GMT, with the day starting at midnight. The term was recommended as a more precise term than &quot;Greenwich Mean Time&quot;, because &quot;GMT&quot; could refer to either an astronomical day starting at noon or a civil day starting at midnight. As the general public had always begun the day at midnight, the timescale continued to be presented to them as Greenwich Mean Time.

When introduced, broadcast time signals were based on UT, and hence on the rotation of the Earth. In 1955 the BIH adopted a proposal by William Markowitz, effective 1 January 1956, dividing UT into UT0 (UT as formerly computed), UT1 (UT0 corrected for polar motion) and UT2 (UT0 corrected for polar motion and seasonal variation). UT1 was the version sufficient for &quot;many astronomical and geodetic applications&quot;, while UT2 was to be broadcast over radio to the public.

UT0 and UT2 soon became irrelevant due to the introduction of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Starting in 1956, WWV broadcast an atomic clock signal stepped by 20 ms increments to bring it into agreement with UT1. The up to 20 ms error from UT1 is on the same order of magnitude as the differences between UT0, UT1, and UT2. By 1960, the U.S. Naval Observatory, the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and the UK National Physical Laboratory had developed UTC, with a similar stepping approach. The 1960 URSI meeting recommended that all time services should follow the lead of the UK and US and broadcast coordinated time using a frequency offset from cesium aimed to match the predicted progression of UT2 with occasional steps as needed. Starting 1 January 1972, UTC was defined to follow UT1 within 0.9 seconds rather than UT2, marking the decline of UT2.

Modern civil time generally follows UTC. In some countries, the term &quot;Greenwich Mean Time&quot; persists in common usage to this day in reference to UT1, in civil timekeeping as well as in astronomical almanacs and other references. Whenever a level of accuracy better than one second is not required, UTC can be used as an approximation of UT1. The difference between UT1 and UTC is known as DUT1.

===Adoption in various countries===
The table shows the dates of adoption of time zones based on the Greenwich meridian, including half-hour zones.



Apart from Nepal Standard Time (UTC+05:45), the Chatham Standard Time Zone (UTC+12:45) used in New Zealand&#x27;s Chatham Islands and the officially unsanctioned Central Western Time Zone (UTC+8:45) used in Eucla, Western Australia and surrounding areas, all time zones in use are defined by an offset from UTC that is a multiple of half an hour, and in most cases a multiple of an hour.

==Measurement==
Historically, Universal Time was computed from observing the position of the Sun in the sky. But astronomers found that it was more accurate to measure the rotation of the Earth by observing stars as they crossed the meridian each day. Nowadays, UT in relation to International Atomic Time (TAI) is determined by Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of the positions of distant celestial objects (stars and quasars), a method which can determine UT1 to within 15 microseconds or better.

The rotation of the Earth and UT are monitored by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS). The International Astronomical Union also is involved in setting standards, but the final arbiter of broadcast standards is the International Telecommunication Union or ITU.

The rotation of the Earth is somewhat irregular and also is very gradually slowing due to tidal acceleration. Furthermore, the length of the second was determined from observations of the Moon between 1750 and 1890. All of these factors cause the modern mean solar day, on the average, to be slightly longer than the nominal 86,400 SI seconds, the traditional number of seconds per day. As UT is thus slightly irregular in its rate, astronomers introduced Ephemeris Time, which has since been replaced by Terrestrial Time (TT). Because Universal Time is determined by the Earth&#x27;s rotation, which drifts away from more precise atomic-frequency standards, an adjustment (called a leap second) to this atomic time is needed since () &#x27;broadcast time&#x27; remains broadly synchronised with solar time. Thus, the civil broadcast standard for time and frequency usually follows International Atomic Time closely, but occasionally step (or &quot;leap&quot;) in order to prevent them from drifting too far from mean solar time.

Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), a form of atomic time, is now used in the construction of the ephemerides of the planets and other solar system objects, for two main reasons. First, these ephemerides are tied to optical and radar observations of planetary motion, and the TDB time scale is fitted so that Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, with corrections for general relativity, are followed. Next, the time scales based on Earth&#x27;s rotation are not uniform and therefore, are not suitable for predicting the motion of bodies in our solar system.

==Alternate versions==

UT1 is the principal form of Universal Time. However, there are also several other infrequently used time standards that are referred to as &quot;Universal Time&quot;, which agree within 0.03 seconds with UT1:

* UT0 is Universal Time determined at an observatory by observing the diurnal motion of stars or extragalactic radio sources, and also from ranging observations of the Moon and artificial Earth satellites. The location of the observatory is considered to have fixed coordinates in a terrestrial reference frame (such as the International Terrestrial Reference Frame) but the position of the rotational axis of the Earth wanders over the surface of the Earth; this is known as polar motion. UT0 does not contain any correction for polar motion while UT1 does include them. The difference between UT0 and UT1 is on the order of a few tens of milliseconds. The designation &quot;UT0&quot; is no longer in common use.
* UT1R is a smoothed version of UT1, filtering out periodic variations due to tides. It includes 62 smoothing terms, with periods ranging from 5.6 days to 18.6 years. UT1R is still in use in the technical literature but rarely used elsewhere.
* UT2 is a smoothed version of UT1, filtering out periodic seasonal variations. It is mostly of historic interest and rarely used anymore. It is defined by
::formula_1
::where &quot;t&quot; is the time as fraction of the Besselian year.

<text>The abstract factory pattern in software engineering is a design pattern that provides a way to create families of related objects without imposing their concrete classes, by encapsulating a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes. According to this pattern, a client software component creates a concrete implementation of the abstract factory and then uses the generic interface of the factory to create the concrete objects that are part of the family. The client does not know which concrete objects it receives from each of these internal factories, as it uses only the generic interfaces of their products. This pattern separates the details of implementation of a set of objects from their general usage and relies on object composition, as object creation is implemented in methods exposed in the factory interface.

Use of this pattern enables interchangeable concrete implementations without changing the code that uses them, even at runtime. However, employment of this pattern, as with similar design patterns, may result in unnecessary complexity and extra work in the initial writing of code. Additionally, higher levels of separation and abstraction can result in systems that are more difficult to debug and maintain.

==Overview==
The abstract factory design pattern is one of the 23 patterns described in the 1994 &quot;Design Patterns&quot; book. It may be used to solve problems such as:
* How can an application be independent of how its objects are created?
* How can a class be independent of how the objects that it requires are created?
* How can families of related or dependent objects be created?

Creating objects directly within the class that requires the objects is inflexible. Doing so commits the class to particular objects and makes it impossible to change the instantiation later without changing the class. It prevents the class from being reusable if other objects are required, and it makes the class difficult to test because real objects cannot be replaced with mock objects.

A factory is the location of a concrete class in the code at which objects are constructed. Implementation of the pattern intends to insulate the creation of objects from their usage and to create families of related objects without depending on their concrete classes. This allows for new derived types to be introduced with no change to the code that uses the base class.

The pattern describes how to solve such problems:
* Encapsulate object creation in a separate (factory) object by defining and implementing an interface for creating objects.
* Delegate object creation to a factory object instead of creating objects directly.

This makes a class independent of how its objects are created. A class may be configured with a factory object, which it uses to create objects, and the factory object can be exchanged at runtime.
==Definition==
&quot;Design Patterns&quot; describes the abstract factory pattern as &quot;an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.&quot;

==Usage==
The factory determines the concrete type of object to be created, and it is here that the object is actually created. However, the factory only returns a reference (in Java, for instance, by the new operator) or a pointer of an abstract type to the created concrete object.

This insulates client code from object creation by having clients request that a factory object create an object of the desired abstract type and return an abstract pointer to the object.

An example is an abstract factory class codice_1 that provides interfaces to create a number of products (e.g., codice_2 and codice_3). The system would have any number of derived concrete versions of the codice_1 class such ascodice_5 or codice_6, each with a different implementation of codice_2 and codice_3 that would create corresponding objects such ascodice_9 or codice_10. Each of these products is derived from a simple abstract class such ascodice_11 or codice_12 of which the client is aware. The client code would acquire an appropriate instance of the codice_1 and call its factory methods. Each of the resulting objects would be created from the same codice_1 implementation and would share a common theme. The client would only need to know how to handle the abstract codice_11 or codice_12 class, not the specific version that was created by the concrete factory.

As the factory only returns a reference or a pointer to an abstract type, the client code that requested the object from the factory is not aware of—and is not burdened by—the actual concrete type of the object that was created. However, the abstract factory knows the type of a concrete object (and hence a concrete factory). For instance, the factory may read the object&#x27;s type from a configuration file. The client has no need to specify the type, as the type has already been specified in the configuration file. In particular, this means:

* The client code has no knowledge of the concrete type, not needing to include any header files or class declarations related to it. The client code deals only with the abstract type. Objects of a concrete type are indeed created by the factory, but the client code accesses such objects only through their abstract interfaces.
* Adding new concrete types is performed by modifying the client code to use a different factory, a modification that is typically one line in one file. The different factory then creates objects of a different concrete type but still returns a pointer of the &quot;same&quot; abstract type as before, thus insulating the client code from change. This is significantly easier than modifying the client code to instantiate a new type. Doing so would require changing every location in the code where a new object is created as well as ensuring that all such code locations have knowledge of the new concrete type, for example, by including a concrete class header file. If all factory objects are stored globally in a singleton object, and all client code passes through the singleton to access the proper factory for object creation, then changing factories is as easy as changing the singleton object.

== Structure ==

=== UML diagram ===
In the above UML class diagram, 
the codice_17 class that requires codice_18 and codice_19 objects does not instantiate the codice_20 and codice_21 classes directly. Instead, the codice_17 refers to the codice_23 interface for creating objects, which makes the codice_17 independent of how the objects are created (which concrete classes are instantiated). The codice_25 class implements the codice_23 interface by instantiating the codice_20 and codice_21 classes.

The UML sequence diagram shows the runtime interactions. The codice_17 object calls codice_30 on the codice_25 object, which creates and returns a codice_20 object. Thereafter, the codice_17 calls codice_34 on codice_25, which creates and returns a codice_21 object.

=== Variants ===
The original structure of the abstract factory pattern, as defined in 1994 in &quot;Design Patterns&quot;, is based on abstract classes for the abstract factory and the abstract products to be created. The concrete factories and products are classes that specialize the abstract classes using inheritance. 

A more recent structure of the pattern is based on interfaces that define the abstract factory and the abstract products to be created. This design uses native support for interfaces or protocols in mainstream programming languages to avoid inheritance. In this case, the concrete factories and products are classes that realize the interface by implementing it. 

== Example ==
This C++23 implementation is based on the pre-C++98 implementation in the book.
import std;

enum class Direction {North, South, East, West};

class MapSite {
public:
 virtual void enter() = 0;
 virtual ~MapSite() = default;

class Room: public MapSite {
public:
 Room(): roomNumber(0) {}
 Room(int n): roomNumber(n) {}
 void setSide(Direction d, MapSite* ms) {
 std::println(&quot;Room::setSide {} ms&quot;, d);
 virtual void enter() {}
 Room(const Room&amp;) = delete; // rule of three
 Room&amp; operator=(const Room&amp;) = delete;
private:
 int roomNumber;

class Wall: public MapSite {
public:
 Wall() {}
 virtual void enter() {}

class Door: public MapSite {
public:
 Door(Room* r1 = nullptr, Room* r2 = nullptr): room1(r1), room2(r2) {}
 virtual void enter() {}
 Door(const Door&amp;) = delete; // rule of three
 Door&amp; operator=(const Door&amp;) = delete;
private:
 Room* room1;
 Room* room2;

class Maze {
public:
 void addRoom(Room* r) {
 std::println(&quot;Maze::addRoom {}&quot;, r);
 Room* roomNo(int) const {
 return nullptr;
};

class MazeFactory {
public:
 MazeFactory() = default;
 virtual ~MazeFactory() = default;

 virtual Maze* makeMaze() const {
 return new Maze;
 virtual Wall* makeWall() const {
 return new Wall;
 virtual Room* makeRoom(int n) const {
 return new Room(n);
 virtual Door* makeDoor(Room* r1, Room* r2) const {
 return new Door(r1, r2);
};

// If createMaze is passed an object as a parameter to use to create rooms, walls, and doors, then you can change the classes of rooms, walls, and doors by passing a different parameter. This is an example of the Abstract Factory (99) pattern.

class MazeGame {
public:
 Maze* createMaze(MazeFactory&amp; factory) {
 Maze* aMaze = factory.makeMaze();
 Room* r1 = factory.makeRoom(1);
 Room* r2 = factory.makeRoom(2);
 Door* aDoor = factory.makeDoor(r1, r2);
 aMaze-&gt;addRoom(r1);
 aMaze-&gt;addRoom(r2);
 r1-&gt;setSide(Direction::North, factory.makeWall());
 r1-&gt;setSide(Direction::East, aDoor);
 r1-&gt;setSide(Direction::South, factory.makeWall());
 r1-&gt;setSide(Direction::West, factory.makeWall());
 r2-&gt;setSide(Direction::North, factory.makeWall());
 r2-&gt;setSide(Direction::East, factory.makeWall());
 r2-&gt;setSide(Direction::South, factory.makeWall());
 r2-&gt;setSide(Direction::West, aDoor);
 return aMaze;
};

int main() {
 MazeGame game;
 MazeFactory factory;
 game.createMaze(factory);


The program output is:
Maze::addRoom 0x1317ed0
Maze::addRoom 0x1317ef0
Room::setSide 0 0x1318340
Room::setSide 2 0x1317f10
Room::setSide 1 0x1318360
Room::setSide 3 0x1318380
Room::setSide 0 0x13183a0
Room::setSide 2 0x13183c0
Room::setSide 1 0x13183e0
Room::setSide 3 0x1317f10

<text>In a telecommunications network, a link is a communication channel that connects two or more devices for the purpose of data transmission. The link may be a dedicated physical link or a virtual circuit that uses one or more physical links or shares a physical link with other telecommunications links.

A telecommunications link is generally based on one of several types of information transmission paths such as those provided by communication satellites, terrestrial radio communications infrastructure and computer networks to connect two or more points.

The term &quot;link&quot; is widely used in computer networking to refer to the communications facilities that connect nodes of a network.

Sometimes the communications facilities that provide the communication channel that constitutes a link are also included in the definition of &quot;link&quot;. 

==Types==

===Point-to-point===
A point-to-point link is a dedicated link that connects exactly two communication facilities (e.g., two nodes of a network, an intercom station at an entryway with a single internal intercom station, a radio path between two points, etc.).

===Broadcast===
Broadcast links connect two or more nodes and support &quot;broadcast transmission&quot;, where one node can transmit so that all other nodes can receive the same transmission. Classic Ethernet is an example.

===Multipoint===
Also known as a &quot;multidrop&quot; link, a multipoint link is a link that connects &quot;two or more&quot; nodes. Also known as general topology networks, these include ATM and Frame Relay links, as well as X.25 networks when used as links for a network-layer protocol like IP.

Unlike broadcast links, there is no mechanism to efficiently send a single message to all other nodes without copying and retransmitting the message.

===Point-to-multipoint===
A point-to-multipoint link (or simply a &quot;multipoint&quot;) is a specific type of multipoint link which consists of a central connection endpoint (CE) that is connected to multiple peripheral CEs. All of the peripheral CEs receive any transmission of data that originates from the central CE while any transmission of data that originates from any of the peripheral CEs is only received by the central CE.

=== Private and public ===
Links are often referred to by terms that refer to the ownership or accessibility of the link.
* A &quot;private link&quot; is a link that is either owned by a specific entity or a link that is only accessible by a particular entity.
* A &quot;public link&quot; is a link that uses the public switched telephone network or other public utility or entity to provide the link and which may also be accessible by anyone.

== Direction ==
=== Uplink ===

*Pertaining to radiocommunication service, an uplink (UL or U/L) is the portion of a feeder link used for the transmission of signals from an earth station to a space radio station, space radio system or high altitude platform station.
*Pertaining to GSM and cellular networks, the radio uplink is the transmission path from the mobile station (cell phone) to a base station (cell site). Traffic and signalling flowing within the BSS and NSS may also be identified as uplink and downlink.
*Pertaining to computer networks, an uplink is a connection from data communications equipment toward the network core. This is also known as an upstream connection.

=== Downlink ===
*Pertaining to radiocommunication service, a downlink (DL or D/L) is the portion of a feeder link used for the transmission of signals from a space radio station, space radio system or high altitude platform station to an earth station.
*In the context of satellite communications, a downlink (DL) is the link from a satellite to a ground station.
*Pertaining to cellular networks, the radio downlink is the transmission path from a cell site to the cell phone. Traffic and signalling flowing within the base station subsystem (BSS) and network switching subsystem (NSS) may also be identified as uplink and downlink.
*Pertaining to computer networks, a downlink is a connection from data communications equipment toward data terminal equipment. This is also known as a downstream connection.

=== Forward link ===
A forward link is the link from a fixed location (e.g., a base station) to a mobile user. If the link includes a communications relay satellite, the forward link will consist of both an uplink (base station to satellite) and a downlink (satellite to mobile user).

=== Reverse link ===
The reverse link (sometimes called a &quot;return channel&quot;) is the link from a mobile user to a fixed base station.

If the link includes a communications relay satellite, the reverse link will consist of both an uplink (mobile station to satellite) and a downlink (satellite to base station) which together constitute a half hop.

<text>In telecommunications, a variable length buffer or elastic buffer is a buffer into which data may be entered at one rate and removed at another rate without changing the data sequence. 

Most first-in first-out (FIFO) storage devices are variable-length buffers in that the input rate may be variable while the output rate is constant or the output rate may be variable while the input rate is constant. Various clocking and control systems are used to allow control of underflow or overflow conditions.

<text>Viewdata is a Videotex implementation. It is a type of information retrieval service in which a subscriber can access a remote database via a common carrier channel, request data and receive requested data on a video display over a separate channel. Samuel Fedida, who had the idea for Viewdata in 1968, was credited as inventor of the system which was developed while working for the British Post Office which was the operator of the national telephone system. The first prototype became operational in 1974. The access, request and reception are usually via common carrier broadcast channels. This is in contrast with teletext.

== Design ==

Viewdata offered a display of 40×24 characters, based on ISO 646 (IRV IA5) – 7 bits with no accented characters.
Originally, Viewdata was accessed with a special purpose terminal (or emulation software) and a modem running at ITU-T V.23 speed (1,200 bit/s down, 75 bit/s up). By 2004, it was normally accessed over TCP/IP using Viewdata client software on a personal computer running Microsoft Windows, or using a Web-based emulator.

Viewdata uses special symbols already widely available on telephone keypads: the &quot;star&quot; key and the &quot;square&quot; key, as formally standardised by the International Telecommunication Union. These are often treated as approximately corresponding to the ASCII asterisk (*) and number sign (#), which do not necessarily conform to the ITU specifications for the keypad symbols; the asterisk is also usually displayed smaller and raised.

These symbols appear as &#x27;Sextile&#x27; and &#x27;Viewdata square&#x27; in the Miscellaneous Symbols and Miscellaneous Technical Unicode blocks, respectively. The sextile was added due to its use in astrology, and the square had previously appeared in the BS_Viewdata character set, as a replacement for the underscore.

In 2013, the German national body submitted a Unicode Technical Committee proposal to align the Unicode reference glyphs with the ITU specifications for these symbols, and annotate them as telephone keypad symbols on the code charts. (Unicode 12.1), these changes have not been accepted/implemented.

== Uses ==

=== Travel industry ===
As of 2015, Viewdata was still in use in the United Kingdom, mainly by the travel industry. Travel agents use it to look up the price and availability of package holidays and flights. Once they find what the customer is looking for they can place a booking.

There are a number of factors still holding up a move to a Web-based standard. Viewdata is regarded within the industry as low-cost and reliable, travel consultants have been trained to use Viewdata and would need training to book holidays on the Internet, and tour operators cannot agree on a Web-based standard. 
=== Bulletin board systems ===
It was made in the late 1970s and early 1980s to make it easier for travel consultants to check availability and make bookings for holidays.
A number of Viewdata bulletin board systems existed in the 1980s, predominantly in the UK due to the proliferation of the BBC Micro, and a short-lived &quot;Viewdata Revival&quot; appeared in the late 1990s fuelled by the retrocomputing vogue. Some Viewdata boards still exist, with accessibility in the form of Java Telnet clients.

<doc id="41851" wikidata="Q777849" url="?curid=41851" title="Virtual circuit">
<text>A virtual circuit (VC) is a means of transporting data over a data network, based on packet switching and in which a connection is first established across the network between two endpoints. The network, rather than having a fixed data rate reservation per connection as in circuit switching, takes advantage of the statistical multiplexing on its transmission links, an intrinsic feature of packet switching. 

A 1978 standardization of virtual circuits by the CCITT imposes per-connection flow controls at all user-to-network and network-to-network interfaces. This permits participation in congestion control and reduces the likelihood of packet loss in a heavily loaded network. Some circuit protocols provide reliable communication service through the use of data retransmissions invoked by error detection and automatic repeat request (ARQ). 

Before a virtual circuit may be used, it must be established between network nodes in the call setup phase. Once established, a bit stream or byte stream may be exchanged between the nodes, providing abstraction from low-level division into protocol data units, and enabling higher-level protocols to operate transparently.

An alternative to virtual-circuit networks are datagram networks.

== Comparison with circuit switching ==
Virtual circuit communication resembles circuit switching, since both are connection oriented, meaning that in both cases data is delivered in correct order, and signaling overhead is required during a connection establishment phase. However, circuit switching provides a constant bit rate and latency, while these may vary in a virtual circuit service due to factors such as:

* varying packet queue lengths in the network nodes,
* varying bit rate generated by the application,
* varying load from other users sharing the same network resources by means of statistical multiplexing, etc.

==Virtual call capability==
In telecommunications, a virtual call capability, sometimes called a virtual call facility, is a service feature in which:

*a call set-up procedure and a call disengagement procedure determine the period of communication between two DTEs in which user data are transferred by a packet switched network
*end-to-end transfer control of packets within the network is required
*data may be delivered to the network by the call originator before the call access phase is completed, but the data are not delivered to the call receiver if the call attempt is unsuccessful
*the network delivers all the user data to the call receiver in the same sequence in which the data are received by the network
*multi-access DTEs may have several virtual calls in progress at the same time.

An alternative approach to virtual calls is connectionless communication using datagrams.

In the early 1970s, &quot;virtual call&quot; &quot;capability&quot; was developed by British Telecom for EPSS (building on the work of Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory). The concept was enhanced by Rémi Després as &quot;virtual circuits&quot; for the RCP experimental network of the French PTT.

==Layer 4 virtual circuits==
Connection oriented transport layer protocols such as TCP may rely on a connectionless packet switching network layer protocol such as IP, where different packets may be routed over different paths, and thus be delivered out of order. However, it is possible to use TCP as a virtual circuit, since TCP includes segment numbering that allows reordering on the receiver side to accommodate out-of-order delivery.

==Layer 2/3 virtual circuits==
Data link layer and network layer virtual circuit protocols are based on connection-oriented packet switching, meaning that data is always delivered along the same network path, i.e., through the same nodes. Advantages with this over connectionless packet switching are: 
* Bandwidth reservation during the connection establishment phase is supported, making guaranteed quality of service (QoS) possible. For example, a constant bit rate QoS class may be provided, resulting in emulation of circuit switching. 
* Less overhead is required since the packets are not routed individually and complete addressing information is not provided in the header of each data packet. Only a small virtual channel identifier (VCI) is required in each packet. Routing information is only transferred to the network nodes during the connection establishment phase.
* The network nodes are faster and have higher capacity in theory since they are switches that only perform routing during the connection establishment phase, while connectionless network nodes are routers that perform routing for each packet individually. Switching only involves looking up the virtual channel identifier in a table rather than analyzing a complete address. Switches can easily be implemented in ASIC hardware, while routing is more complex and requires software implementation. However, because of the large market of IP routers, and because advanced IP routers support layer 3 switching, modern IP routers may today be faster than switches for connection-oriented protocols.

==Example protocols==
Examples of transport layer protocols that provide a virtual circuit:
* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), where a reliable virtual circuit is established on top of the underlying unreliable and connectionless IP protocol. The virtual circuit is identified by the source and destination network socket address pair, i.e. the sender and receiver IP address and port number. Guaranteed QoS is not provided.
* Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), where a virtual circuit is established on top of the IP protocol.
Examples of network-layer and data-link-layer virtual circuit protocols, where data always is delivered over the same path:
* X.25, where the VC is identified by a virtual channel identifier (VCI). X.25 provides reliable node-to-node communication and guaranteed QoS.
* Frame Relay, where the VC is identified by a DLCI. Frame Relay is unreliable, but may provide guaranteed QoS.
* Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), where the circuit is identified by a virtual path identifier (VPI) and virtual channel identifier (VCI) pair. The ATM layer provides unreliable virtual circuits, but the ATM protocol provides for reliability through the ATM adaptation layer (AAL) Service Specific Convergence Sublayer (SSCS) (though it uses the terms &quot;assured&quot; and &quot;non-assured&quot; rather than &quot;reliable&quot; and &quot;unreliable&quot;).
* General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)
* Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), which can be used for IP over virtual circuits. Each circuit is identified by a label. MPLS is unreliable but provides eight different QoS classes.

==Permanent and switched virtual circuits in ATM, Frame Relay, and X.25==
Switched virtual circuits (SVCs) are generally set up on a per-call basis and are disconnected when the call is terminated; however, a permanent virtual circuit (PVC) can be established as an option to provide a dedicated circuit link between two facilities. PVC configuration is usually preconfigured by the service provider. Unlike SVCs, PVC are usually very seldom broken/disconnected.

A switched virtual circuit (SVC) is a virtual circuit that is dynamically established on demand and is torn down when transmission is complete, for example after a phone call or a file download. SVCs are used in situations where data transmission is sporadic and/or not always between the same data terminal equipment (DTE) endpoints.

A permanent virtual circuit (PVC) is a virtual circuit established for repeated/continuous use between the same DTE. In a PVC, the long-term association is identical to the data transfer phase of a virtual call. Permanent virtual circuits eliminate the need for repeated call set-up and clearing.

* Frame Relay is typically used to provide PVCs.
* ATM provides both switched virtual connections and permanent virtual connections, as they are called in ATM terminology.
* X.25 provides both virtual calls and PVCs, although not all X.25 service providers or DTE implementations support PVCs as their use was much less common than SVCs

<text>In open systems, a virtual terminal (VT) is an application service that:

# Allows host terminals on a multi-user network to interact with other hosts regardless of terminal type and characteristics,
# Allows remote log-on by local area network managers for the purpose of management,
# Allows users to access information from another host processor for transaction processing,
# Serves as a backup facility.

PuTTY is an example of a virtual terminal.

ITU-T defines a virtual terminal protocol based on the OSI application layer protocols. However, the virtual terminal protocol is not widely used on the Internet.

<text>A voice frequency (VF) or voice band is the range of audio frequencies used for the transmission of speech.

== Frequency band ==
In telephony, the usable voice frequency band ranges from approximately 300 to 3400 Hz. It is for this reason that the ultra low frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum between 300 and 3000 Hz is also referred to as &quot;voice frequency&quot;, being the electromagnetic energy that represents acoustic energy at baseband. The bandwidth allocated for a single voice-frequency transmission channel is usually 4 kHz, including guard bands, allowing a sampling rate of 8 kHz to be used as the basis of the pulse-code modulation system used for the digital PSTN. Per the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem, the sampling frequency (8 kHz) must be at least twice the highest component of the voice frequency via appropriate filtering prior to sampling at discrete times (4 kHz) for effective reconstruction of the voice signal.

== Fundamental frequency ==
The voiced speech of a typical adult male will have a fundamental frequency from 90 to 155 Hz, and that of a typical adult female from 165 to 255 Hz. Thus, the fundamental frequency of most speech falls below the bottom of the voice frequency band as defined. However, enough of the harmonic series will be present for the missing fundamental to create the impression of hearing the fundamental tone.

== Wavelength ==
The speed of sound at room temperature (20°C) is 343.15 m/s. Using the formula
:formula_1
we have:

Typical female voices range from to .

Typical male voices range from to .

<doc id="41859" wikidata="Q1641516" url="?curid=41859" title="Voice-operated switch">
<text>In telecommunications, a voice operated switch, also known as VOX or voice-operated exchange, is a switch that operates when sound over a certain threshold is detected. It is usually used to turn on a transmitter or recorder when someone speaks and turn it off when they stop speaking. It is used instead of a push-to-talk button on transmitters or to save storage space on recording devices. On cell phones, it is used to save battery life. Intercom systems that use a speaker in a room as both a speaker and a microphone will often use VOX on the main console to switch the audio direction during a conversation. The circuit usually includes a delay between the sound stopping and switching direction, to avoid the circuit turning off during short pauses in speech.

A special case exists, if there is enough energy to power the system directly. For example, a microphone may send a voltage high enough to directly operate a transmitter.

== Comparison with push-to-talk ==
Unlike manual push-to-talk (PTT) operation, VOX is
automatic; the user can keep his or her hands free while talking. But VOX also has some significant disadvantages that explain why PTT is still common.

Most VOX circuits have a sensitivity adjustment, but unwanted (and sometimes undetected) VOX triggering can still occur on background noise, heavy breathing or a side conversation. Conversely, it may not activate when desired on speech that is too weak.

The VOX in a two-way radio can also be triggered by the loudspeaker carrying the other side of the conversation. This problem can be
minimized with an &quot;anti vox&quot; feature to decrease VOX sensitivity when the receiver is active.

Transmitters and recorders have short but finite activation times that
may clip the beginnings of phrases. Some modern VOX circuits eliminate this problem by recording or transmitting a delayed version of the input signal. An older way of overcoming this, used by pilots, and astronauts, as some of the first users of VOX, was to habitually preface every transmission with &quot;uh&quot; in place of keying the microphone.

VOX uses a &quot;hang&quot; timer, typically 1–3 seconds, to remain engaged during brief speech pauses. This means the last several seconds of each transmission or recorded segment are always silence. A VOX-activated recorder can delete the end of each segment but the user of a VOX-activated half duplex radio must wait for the timer to expire before he or she can receive again.

<doc id="41860" wikidata="Q267131" url="?curid=41860" title="Wafer (electronics)">
<text>In electronics, a wafer (also called a slice or substrate) is a thin slice of semiconductor, such as a crystalline silicon (c-Si, silicium), used for the fabrication of integrated circuits and, in photovoltaics, to manufacture solar cells.

The wafer serves as the substrate for microelectronic devices built in and upon the wafer. It undergoes many microfabrication processes, such as doping, ion implantation, etching, thin-film deposition of various materials, and photolithographic patterning. Finally, the individual microcircuits are separated by wafer dicing and packaged as an integrated circuit.

== History ==

In the semiconductor industry, the term wafer appeared in the 1950s to describe a thin round slice of semiconductor material, typically germanium or silicon. The round shape characteristic of these wafers comes from single-crystal ingots usually produced using the Czochralski method. Though, silicon wafers were first introduced in the 1940s.

By 1960, silicon wafers were being manufactured in the U.S. by companies such as MEMC and SunEdison. In 1965, American engineers Eric O. Ernst, Donald J. Hurd, and Gerard Seeley, while working under IBM, filed Patent US3423629A for the first high-capacity epitaxial apparatus.

Today, silicon wafers are made by companies such as Sumco, Shin-Etsu Chemical, Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation and Siltronic.

== Production ==

=== Formation ===

Wafers are formed of highly pure,
nearly defect-free single crystalline material, with a purity of 99.9999999% (9N) or higher.
One process for forming crystalline wafers is known as the Czochralski method, invented by Polish chemist Jan Czochralski. In this process, a cylindrical ingot of high purity monocrystalline semiconductor, such as silicon or germanium, called a boule, is formed by pulling a seed crystal from a melt. Donor impurity atoms, such as boron or phosphorus in the case of silicon, can be added to the molten intrinsic material in precise amounts in order to dope the crystal, thus changing it into an extrinsic semiconductor of n-type or p-type.

The boule is then with a wafer saw (a type of wire saw), machined to improve flatness, chemically etched to remove crystal damage from machining steps and finally polished to form wafers. The size of wafers for photovoltaics is 100–200 mm square and the thickness is 100–500 μm. Electronics use wafer sizes from 100 to 450 mm diameter. The largest wafers made have a diameter of 450 mm, but are not yet in general use.

=== Cleaning, texturing and etching ===

Wafers are cleaned with weak acids to remove unwanted particles. There are several standard cleaning procedures to make sure the surface of a silicon wafer contains no contamination. One of the most effective methods is the RCA clean.
When used for solar cells, the wafers are textured to create a rough surface to increase surface area and so their efficiency. The generated PSG (phosphosilicate glass) is removed from the edge of the wafer in the etching.

== Wafer properties ==

=== Standard wafer sizes ===
==== Silicon substrate ====
Silicon wafers are available in a variety of diameters from 25.4 mm (1 inch) to 300 mm (11.8 inches). Semiconductor fabrication plants, colloquially known as &quot;fabs&quot;, are defined by the diameter of wafers that they are tooled to produce. The diameter has gradually increased to improve throughput and reduce cost with the current state-of-the-art fab using , with a proposal to adopt . Intel, TSMC, and Samsung were separately conducting research to the advent of &quot;prototype&quot; (research) fabs, though serious hurdles remain.

Wafers grown using materials other than silicon will have different thicknesses than a silicon wafer of the same diameter. Wafer thickness is determined by the mechanical strength of the material used; the wafer must be thick enough to support its own weight without cracking during handling. The tabulated thicknesses relate to when that process was introduced, and are not necessarily correct currently, for example the IBM BiCMOS7WL process is on 8-inch wafers, but these are only 200 μm thick. The weight of the wafer increases with its thickness and the square of its diameter. Date of introduction does not indicate that factories will convert their equipment immediately, in fact, many factories do not bother upgrading. Instead, companies tend to expand and build whole new lines with newer technologies, leaving a large spectrum of technologies in use at the same time.

==== Gallium Nitride substrate ====
GaN substrate wafers typically have had their own independent timelines, parallel but far lagging silicon substrate, but ahead of other substrates. The world&#x27;s first 300 mm wafer made of GaN was announced in Sept 2024 by Infineon, suggesting in the coming future they could put into use the first factory with 300 mm GaN commercial output.

==== SiC substrate ====
Meanwhile world&#x27;s first Silicon Carbide (SiC) 200 mm wafers were announced in July 2021 by ST Microelectronics. It is not known if SiC 200 mm has entered volume production as of 2024, as typically the largest fabs for SiC in commercial production remain at 150 mm.

==== Silicon on sapphire ====
Silicon on sapphire is different from silicon substrate as the substrate is sapphire, while superstrate is silicon, while epitaxal layers and doping can be anything. SOS in commercial production is typically maxed out at 150 mm wafer sizes as of 2024.

==== Gallium Arsenide substrate ====
GaAs wafers tend to be 150 mm at largest, in commercial production as of 2024.

==== Aluminum Nitride substrate ====
AlN tends to be 50 mm or 2 inch wafers in commercial production, while 100 mm or 4 inch wafers are being developed as of 2024 by wafer suppliers like Asahi Kasei. However, merely because a wafer exists commercially, does not imply in any way that processing equipment to produce chips on that wafer exists, indeed such equipment tends to lag development until paying end customer demand materializes. Even after equipment is developed (years), it can take further years for fabs to figure out how to use the machines productively.

==== Historical increases of wafer size ====
A unit of wafer fabrication step, such as an etch step, can produce more chips proportional to the increase in wafer area, while the cost of the unit fabrication step goes up more slowly than the wafer area. This was the cost basis for increasing wafer size. Conversion to 300 mm wafers from 200 mm wafers began in early 2000, and reduced the price per die for about 30–40%.Larger diameter wafers allow for more die per wafer.

==== Photovoltaic ====

M1 wafer size (156.75 mm) is in the process of being phased out in China as of 2020. Various nonstandard wafer sizes have arisen, so efforts to fully adopt the M10 standard (182 mm) are ongoing. Like other semiconductor fabrication processes, driving down costs has been the main driving factor for this attempted size increase, in spite of the differences in the manufacturing processes of different types of devices.

=== Crystalline orientation ===

Wafers are grown from crystal having a regular crystal structure, with silicon having a diamond cubic structure with a lattice spacing of 5.430710 Å (0.5430710 nm). When cut into wafers, the surface is aligned in one of several relative directions known as crystal orientations. Orientation is defined by the Miller index with (100) or (111) faces being the most common for silicon.
Orientation is important since many of a single crystal&#x27;s structural and electronic properties are highly anisotropic. Ion implantation depths depend on the wafer&#x27;s crystal orientation, since each direction offers distinct paths for transport.

Wafer cleavage typically occurs only in a few well-defined directions. Scoring the wafer along cleavage planes allows it to be easily diced into individual chips (&quot;dies&quot;) so that the billions of individual circuit elements on an average wafer can be separated into many individual circuits.

=== Crystallographic orientation notches ===

Wafers under 200 mm diameter have &quot;flats&quot; cut into one or more sides indicating the crystallographic planes of the wafer (usually a {110} face). In earlier-generation wafers a pair of flats at different angles additionally conveyed the doping type (see illustration for conventions). Wafers of 200 mm diameter and above use a single small notch to convey wafer orientation, with no visual indication of doping type. 450 mm wafers are notchless, relying on a laser scribed structure on the wafer surface for orientation.

=== Impurity doping ===

Silicon wafers are generally not 100% pure silicon, but are instead formed with an initial impurity doping concentration between 1013 and 1016 atoms per cm3 of boron, phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony which is added to the melt and defines the wafer as either bulk n-type or p-type. However, compared with single-crystal silicon&#x27;s atomic density of 5×1022 atoms per cm3, this still gives a purity greater than 99.9999%. The wafers can also be initially provided with some interstitial oxygen concentration. Carbon and metallic contamination are kept to a minimum. Transition metals, in particular, must be kept below parts per billion concentrations for electronic applications.

=== Challenges ===
There is considerable resistance to the 450 mm transition despite the possible productivity improvement, because of concern about insufficient return on investment. There are also issues related to increased inter-die / edge-to-edge wafer variation and additional edge defects. 450mm wafers are expected to cost 4 times as much as 300mm wafers, and equipment costs are expected to rise by 20 to 50%. Higher cost semiconductor fabrication equipment for larger wafers increases the cost of 450 mm fabs (semiconductor fabrication facilities or factories). Lithographer Chris Mack claimed in 2012 that the overall price per die for 450 mm wafers would be reduced by only 10–20% compared to 300 mm wafers, because over 50% of total wafer processing costs are lithography-related. Converting to larger 450 mm wafers would reduce price per die only for process operations such as etch where cost is related to wafer count, not wafer area. Cost for processes such as lithography is proportional to wafer area, and larger wafers would not reduce the lithography contribution to die cost.

Nikon planned to deliver 450-mm lithography equipment in 2015, with volume production in 2017. In November 2013 ASML paused development of 450-mm lithography equipment, citing uncertain timing of chipmaker demand.

In 2012, a group consisting of New York State (SUNY Poly/College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE)), Intel, TSMC, Samsung, IBM, Globalfoundries and Nikon companies has formed a public-private partnership called Global 450mm Consortium (G450C, similar to SEMATECH) who made a 5-year plan (expiring in 2016) to develop a &quot;cost effective wafer fabrication infrastructure, equipment prototypes and tools to enable coordinated industry transition to 450mm wafer level&quot;. In the mid of 2014 CNSE has announced that it will reveal first fully patterned 450mm wafers at SEMICON West. In early 2017, the G450C began to dismantle its activities over 450mm wafer research due to undisclosed reasons. Various sources have speculated that demise of the group came after charges of bid rigging made against Alain E. Kaloyeros, who at the time was a chief executive at the SUNY Poly. The industry realization of the fact that the 300mm manufacturing optimization is more cheap than costly 450mm transition may also have played a role.

The timeline for 450 mm has not been fixed. In 2012, it was expected that 450mm production would start in 2017, which never realized. Mark Durcan, then CEO of Micron Technology, said in February 2014 that he expects 450 mm adoption to be delayed indefinitely or discontinued. &quot;I am not convinced that 450mm will ever happen but, to the extent that it does, it&#x27;s a long way out in the future. There is not a lot of necessity for Micron, at least over the next five years, to be spending a lot of money on 450mm.&quot;

&quot;There is a lot of investment that needs to go on in the equipment community to make that happen. And the value at the end of the day – so that customers would buy that equipment – I think is dubious.&quot; As of March 2014, Intel Corporation expected 450 mm deployment by 2020 (by the end of this decade). Mark LaPedus of semiengineering.com reported in mid-2014 that chipmakers had delayed adoption of 450 mm &quot;for the foreseeable future.&quot; According to this report some observers expected 2018 to 2020, while G. Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSI Research, didn&#x27;t see 450mm fabs moving into production until 2020 to 2025.

The step up to 300 mm required major changes, with fully automated factories using 300 mm wafers versus barely automated factories for the 200 mm wafers, partly because a FOUP for 300 mm wafers weighs about 7.5 kilograms when loaded with 25 300 mm wafers where a SMIF weighs about 4.8 kilograms when loaded with 25 200 mm wafers, thus requiring twice the amount of physical strength from factory workers, and increasing fatigue. 300mm FOUPs have handles so that they can be still be moved by hand. 450mm FOUPs weigh 45 kilograms when loaded with 25 450 mm wafers, thus cranes are necessary to manually handle the FOUPs and handles are no longer present in the FOUP. FOUPs are moved around using material handling systems from Muratec or Daifuku. These major investments were undertaken in the economic downturn following the dot-com bubble, resulting in huge resistance to upgrading to 450 mm by the original timeframe. On the ramp-up to 450 mm, the crystal ingots will be 3 times heavier (total weight a metric ton) and take 2–4 times longer to cool, and the process time will be double. All told, the development of 450 mm wafers requires significant engineering, time, and cost to overcome.

== Analytical die count estimation ==
In order to minimize the cost per die, manufacturers wish to maximize the number of dies that can be made from a single wafer; dies always have a square or rectangular shape due to the constraint of wafer dicing. In general, this is a computationally complex problem with no analytical solution, dependent on both the area of the dies as well as their aspect ratio (square or rectangular) and other considerations such as the width of the scribeline or saw lane, and additional space occupied by alignment and test structures. (By simplifying the problem so that the scribeline and saw lane are both zero-width, the wafer is perfectly circular with no flats, and the dies have a square aspect ratio, we arrive at the Gauss Circle Problem, an unsolved open problem in mathematics.)

Note that formulas estimating the gross dies per wafer (DPW) account only for the number of complete dies that can fit on the wafer; gross DPW calculations do &quot;not&quot; account for yield loss among those complete dies due to defects or parametric issues.

Nevertheless, the number of gross DPW can be estimated starting with the first-order approximation or floor function of wafer-to-die area ratio,
:formula_1,
where
* formula_2 is the wafer diameter (typically in mm)
* formula_3 the size of each die (mm2) including the width of the scribeline ( or in the case of a saw lane, the kerf plus a tolerance).

This formula simply states that the number of dies which can fit on the wafer cannot exceed the area of the wafer divided by the area of each individual die. It will always overestimate the true best-case gross DPW, since it includes the area of partially patterned dies which do not fully lie on the wafer surface (see figure). These partially patterned dies don&#x27;t represent complete ICs, so they usually cannot be sold as functional parts.

Refinements of this simple formula typically add an edge correction, to account for partial dies on the edge, which in general will be more significant when the area of the die is large compared to the total area of the wafer. In the other limiting case (infinitesimally small dies or infinitely large wafers), the edge correction is negligible.

The correction factor or correction term generally takes one of the forms cited by De Vries:

:formula_4 (area ratio – circumference/(die diagonal length))
:or formula_5 (area ratio scaled by an exponential factor)
:or formula_6 (area ratio scaled by a polynomial factor).

Studies comparing these analytical formulas to brute-force computational results show that the formulas can be made more accurate, over practical ranges of die sizes and aspect ratios, by adjusting the coefficients of the corrections to values above or below unity, and by replacing the linear die dimension formula_7 with formula_8 (average side length) in the case of dies with large aspect ratio:

:formula_9
:or formula_10
:or formula_11.

== Compound semiconductors ==

While silicon is the prevalent material for wafers used in the electronics industry, other compound III-V or II-VI materials have also been employed. Gallium arsenide (GaAs), a III-V semiconductor produced via the Czochralski method, gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) are also common wafer materials, with GaN and sapphire being extensively used in LED manufacturing.
