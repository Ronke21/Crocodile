<text>Clifford Joseph Price MBE (born 19 September 1965), better known as Goldie, is an English music producer, DJ, and actor.

Initially gaining exposure for his work as a graffiti artist, Goldie became well known for his pioneering role as a musician in the 1990s UK jungle, drum and bass and breakbeat hardcore scenes. He released a variety of singles under the pseudonym Rufige Kru and co-founded the label Metalheadz. He later released several albums under his own name, including the 1995 album &quot;Timeless&quot;, which entered the UK charts at number 7.

Goldie&#x27;s acting credits include the 1999 James Bond film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, Guy Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;Snatch&quot; (2000) and the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; (2001–2002). He has also appeared in a number of celebrity reality television shows, including &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 2&quot; (UK), &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot; and &quot;Maestro&quot;.

== Early life ==
Born in Walsall, England, but raised in Wolverhampton, Price is of Jamaican and Scottish heritage. He was put up for adoption at the age of three, and raised in childcare homes and by several foster parents. According to his 2002 autobiography, he was physically and sexually abused during this time. Price was a member of the breakdance crew Westside, based in the Whitmore Reans and Heath Town areas of Wolverhampton, in the 1980s. He later joined a breakdance crew called the Birmingham Bboys, and made his name as a graffiti artist in the West Midlands.

His artwork around Birmingham and Wolverhampton was featured heavily in Dick Fontaine&#x27;s documentary &quot;Bombin″&quot;. He is mentioned for his graffiti in the book &quot;Spraycan Art&quot; by Henry Chalfant and James Prigoff, which contains several examples of his art.

He moved to the United States owing to graffiti projects, and also started selling grills (gold teeth jewellery) in New York and Miami; he continued this business after his return to the UK in 1988. His nickname stems from &quot;Goldielocks&quot;, an earlier nickname given to him during his Bboys days and subsequently shortened when he no longer wore dreadlocks.

==Career==
=== Music ===
By 1991, Price had become fascinated by the British breakbeat music scene when his girlfriend, DJ Kemistry, introduced him to the pioneering jungle and drum and bass producers Dennis &quot;Dego&quot; McFarlane and Mark &quot;Marc Mac&quot; Clair, known as 4hero. He went on to execute some design and A&amp;R work for 4hero&#x27;s Reinforced Records label.

In 1992, Price made his first record appearance by contributing to an EP by Icelandic group Ajax Project that included the track &quot;Ruffige&quot;.

His releases &quot;Killa Muffin&quot; b/w &quot;Krisp Biscuit&quot; and the &quot;Dark Rider&quot; EP were released under the alias &quot;Rufige Kru&quot; His track &quot;Terminator&quot;, released under the name &quot;Metal Heads&quot; in 1992, was a hit in the jungle scene and is noted for its use of pitch shifting. In 1993, he released &quot;Angel&quot;, another 12&quot; on the Synthetic Hardcore Phonography label. 1994 saw him setting up his own record label, Metalheadz.
His first studio album, &quot;Timeless&quot;, followed in 1995. &quot;Timeless&quot; entered the UK Albums Chart at number seven. The album fused the breakbeats and basslines common in jungle with orchestral textures and soul vocals by Diane Charlemagne. The album&#x27;s title track was a 21-minute symphonic piece. &quot;Inner City Life&quot;, a track from the album, reached number 39 in the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Timeless&quot; helped to popularise drum and bass as a form of musical expression. The music critic Simon Reynolds noted that Price&#x27;s credentials as a musical innovator—and particularly as one of the key driving forces of innovation in the jungle/breakbeat scene—were exceptional. &quot;Goldie revolutionised jungle not once but thrice&quot;, he noted in &quot;The Wire&quot; magazine, continuing, &quot;First there was &#x27;Terminator&#x27; (pioneering the use of time stretching), then &#x27;Angel&#x27; (fusing Diane Charlemagne&#x27;s live vocal with David Byrne/Brian Eno samples to prove that hardcore could be more &#x27;conventionally&#x27; musical), now there&#x27;s &#x27;Timeless&#x27;, a 22-minute hardcore symphony.&quot;

In 1996, he released the &quot;Toasted Both Sides Please&quot; remix of the Bush song &quot;Swallowed&quot;, which topped charts in the US and Canada.

Price released his second album, &quot;Saturnz Return&quot;, in 1998. The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Mother&quot;, is an hour-long orchestral drum and bass piece. The album featured appearances by David Bowie, Noel Gallagher and KRS-One. The album met with mixed reviews. David Brown of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the album &quot;ambitious but monotonous and overlong—Pink Floyd with a gold tooth&quot;.

In 2002, Price said that he had been working for three years on a film called &quot;Sine Tempus&quot;, described as a coming-of-age story of a young paintbrush artist. In 2006, he announced the soundtrack as his new album. The album was released via the Metalheadz website in 2008, but the film has not been released.

Price is known for his work as the leader of Rufige Kru. The group has no fixed members and has included drum and bass producers such as Technical Itch, Heist, Cujo, Agzilla Da Ice, Danny J, Doc Scott and Rob Playford.

March 2013 saw the release of &quot;The Alchemist: The Best of Goldie 1992–2012&quot;, featuring prominent tracks from throughout Price&#x27;s musical career. A subsequent compilation, the three-CD Masterpiece set released by Ministry of Sound in 2014, brought together tracks that influenced him (Soul II Soul&#x27;s &quot;Back To Life&quot;, Roy Ayers&#x27; &quot;Everybody Loves The Sunshine&quot;) with cuts that soundtracked his entry into the rave scene and key moments from the drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass scene.

In 2017, the Goldie album &quot;The Journey Man&quot; was released, which Price described as his &quot;magnum opus&quot; and &quot;the most important thing that I&#x27;ve ever made.&quot;

In 2020, Goldie launched his new record label, Fallen Tree 1Hundred.

A 25th anniversary edition of Timeless was released by London Records the following year. The new release included a triple gold vinyl version and a compact disc version. The release brought the number of versions of the iconic drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass album (including reissues and global pressings) to 44.

=== Acting ===
Price has appeared in Guy Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;Snatch&quot; and several other films, most notably the James Bond film, &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;. He also played gangster Angel Hudson in the British soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; (2001–2002). Price starred in &quot;Everybody Loves Sunshine&quot; (1999) (aka &quot;B.U.S.T.E.D.&quot; – United States title) with David Bowie.

=== Television appearances ===
Price appeared on BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Daytime Live&quot; in October 1987 to discuss the rise of urban art across the United Kingdom. Price also appeared on &quot;Central Weekend&quot;, a Friday evening topical debate show on Central TV, promoting graffiti as an art form. He had a small documentary made about his own art on Central TV&#x27;s &quot;Here and Now&quot; programme featuring Pogus Caesar&#x27;s photographs of New York. He has appeared on various young people&#x27;s TV shows as part of a breakdance crew, the Bboys from Wolverhampton. In 1995, he appeared on &quot;Passengers&quot;, and in a Channel 4 documentary about himself in 1998.

His next TV appearance was hosting &quot;Crime Business&quot; on the digital TV channels Bravo and Ftn. He presented the documentary series &quot;The World&#x27;s Deadliest Gangs&quot; on Bravo in 2002.

Price appeared on the second series of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; in 2002. He was the first celebrity to be &quot;evicted&quot;. In 2006, he was scheduled to appear in &quot;The Games&quot;, a UK reality TV show on Channel 4, but during training for the water-ski jump event he fractured his femur and was unable to take part in the show. He was replaced by Adam Rickitt. In 2009, he was reported to be suing the producers of the show for damages as a result of the injury.

In June 2008, Price participated in the German/French TV channel ARTEs format &#x27;Into the Night with ...&#x27; episode 052, where he met artist Skream. The episode not only shows an adventurous encounter between two hard-drinking stars of the club scene, but also a close-up look at the operation of one of Europe&#x27;s most important electro festivals, the Melt Festival.

During August and September 2008, the BBC broadcast &quot;Maestro&quot;, a reality television show in which eight celebrities, including Price, learned to conduct a concert orchestra. Price was placed second, behind Sue Perkins.

On 31 July 2009, the first of a two-part television programme &quot;Classic Goldie&quot; was broadcast, showing how in the wake of his success in the &quot;Maestro&quot; programme he learns to write a score for a large orchestra and choir. The resulting composition, commissioned by the BBC and entitled &quot;Sine Tempore&quot; (&quot;Timeless&quot;), was performed at two children&#x27;s Promenade concerts in the Royal Albert Hall on 1 and 2 August 2009, which featured music connected with Charles Darwin and the creation and evolution of the world.

He appeared on &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot; on 27 December 2009 and came fourth behind Paul O&#x27;Grady, Gail Emms and Loyd Grossman. On 11 September 2010, he was announced as part of the line-up in &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, staying in the competition for two weeks.

On 22 December 2010, he appeared in a &quot;Celebrity Come Dine with Me&quot; Christmas special.

On 26 March 2011, he appeared in a three-part reality television series, &quot;Goldie&#x27;s Band: By Royal Appointment&quot; in which he led a group of music experts as they conducted a nationwide search for young talented musicians and then selected and coached 12 of them, who collaborated to create some musical pieces for a performance at Buckingham Palace.

In 2014, he appeared on the telethon &quot;BBC Children in Need&quot;.

=== Art ===
In 2007, Price returned to the art world with an art exhibition, &quot;Love Over Gold&quot;, which was held at the Leonard Street Gallery, London. In 2008, he teamed up with Pete Tong to provide much of the artwork for Tong&#x27;s new Wonderland club night at Eden nightclub in San Antonio, Ibiza.

There was an exhibition of Price&#x27;s art in Berlin from 13 to 26 June 2008. In April 2009, a retrospective exhibition titled &quot;Kids Are All Riot&quot; took place in Shoreditch, London, coinciding with the release of his screenprint &quot;Apocalypse Angel&quot;.

Around 2008, Price&#x27;s art work was displayed on the London Underground by the arts company Art Below.

In 2021, he modeled for Louis Vuitton Menswear Spring / Summer collection and contributed a song.

=== Books ===
The innovative nature of Goldie&#x27;s art (both sonic and visual) was a consistent theme in Kodwo Eshun&#x27;s acclaimed book &#x27;More Brilliant Than The Sun&#x27; (published in 1998) which has long been seen as a landmark text on Afro-futurism. Among the works that Eshun referenced were Goldie&#x27;s 1986 graffiti piece Future World Machine and his 1992 single &#x27;Terminator&#x27;. Noting the links between the multi-dimensionality in both painting and sound, Eshun noted: &quot;There&#x27;s a big interface between graffiti and the break.&quot;

In 2002, Goldie&#x27;s autobiography &#x27;Nine Lives&#x27; was published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton. Written with London-based writer Paul Gorman, the book traced his life story from childhood in care and foster homes through to the first flush of his success as a groundbreaking musical artist.

A second autobiography &#x27;All Things Remembered&#x27; was published in November 2017 by Faber &amp; Faber. Written when Goldie was 52, it covers a more comprehensive span than the earlier book but is more philosophic in tone. While incidents from his extraordinary childhood are recounted, it also includes his ruminations on musical heroes such as Pat Metheny and a conversation with &quot;my left-hand man&quot; Doc Scott as well as memories of his work in TV and film. The book includes pictures of Goldie on set with David Bowie. Co-written with Ben Thompson, &#x27;All Things Remembered&#x27; was chosen by Nicola Barker as one of The Guardian&#x27;s Books Of The Year. She described it as &quot;a fabulous, whirling kaleidoscope of music, memory and trauma . . . magical and cautionary.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In the early 1990s, Price had a relationship with drum and bass artist Kemistry, who died in a car accident in 1999. 

He was romantically involved with Icelandic singer Björk in 1996. His relationship with Björk, and her previous relationship that year with Massive Attack member Tricky, upset Ricardo Lopez, an obsessed Björk fan, who was angered by the fact that Björk was in a relationship with a black man (in both Price’s and Tricky’s case) and, on September 12, 1996, sent an explosive device to Björk, disguised as a book, which was designed to spray sulfuric acid on her face, disfiguring her or killing her. Lopez then went back to his apartment, shaved off all the hair on his head, and painted his face and head red and green, before shooting himself, all of which he filmed. The device failed to reach Björk because Lopez’s body, and his plans, were discovered before the package was delivered, and the device was defused by Scotland Yard.

In 1998, Price bought a country house in Bovingdon, Hertfordshire.

Price married model Sonjia Ashby in 2002. They divorced in 2005. As of 2003, he had five children, including social content creator Danny Price, who has appeared on Channel 4 reality show &quot;Make Me Prime Minister&quot;.

In 2007, Goldie began a relationship with Mika Wassenaar, a Canadian. The couple appeared in the 20 June 2009 episode of ITV&#x27;s &quot;All Star Mr &amp; Mrs&quot; with Phillip Schofield and Fern Britton. Mika and Price married in 2010.

On 29 April 2010, Price opened the William Tyndale Primary School Sports Pitch in Islington, London.

In July 2010, Price received an honorary doctorate in Social Sciences from Brunel University, Uxbridge. On 3 September 2010, he received an honorary degree of Doctor of Design from the University of Wolverhampton.

On 7 September 2010, Price&#x27;s 23-year-old son Jamie Price was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum sentence of 21 years, for murder. He was convicted of stabbing a rival gang member to death in Wolverhampton town centre on 24 August 2008.

As of 2017, Price and his wife were living in Thailand, having moved there in 2015.

Price was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours awards, for services to music and young people.

Price was accused of assaulting a security guard at the 2017 Glastonbury festival after the guard had refused to let Price&#x27;s daughter, Chance, backstage; Price later emailed a response which read, &quot;Yep, guilty as charged&quot;, but in March 2018, district judge Lynn Matthews at Bristol Magistrates&#x27; Court rejected Price&#x27;s emailed response and in a video call Price later admitted to assault by beating. On 30 May Bristol Magistrates&#x27; Court ordered Goldie to pay almost £2,500 as a fine.

In 2017, Price appeared to reveal the first name of pseudonymous graffiti artist Banksy as &quot;Rob&quot; on Scroobius Pip&#x27;s weekly &quot;Distraction Pieces Podcast&quot; (Episode #156). When discussing the rise of commercialism in street art, Price said, &quot;Give me a bubble letter and put it on a T-shirt and write Banksy on it and we&#x27;re sorted. We can sell it now... No disrespect to Rob, I think he is a brilliant artist. I think he has flipped the world of art over.&quot;

<text>Winter sports or winter activities are competitive sports or non-competitive recreational activities which are played on snow or ice. Most are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally, such games were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Playing areas and fields consist of either snow or ice.

Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey, para ice hockey, ringette, broomball, bandy, rink bandy, rinkball, and spongee in a milder climate. The sport of speed skating uses a frozen circular track of ice, but in some facilities the track is combined in an enclosed area used for sports requiring an ice rink or the rink itself is used. Alternatively, ice cross downhill uses a track with various levels of elevation and a combination of bends. Long distance skating ( &quot;marathon skating&quot;) such as tour skating is only performed outdoors and uses the available natural ice from frozen lakes, ponds, and marshes. Tour skating at times includes speed skaters, though tour skates are more common.

Common individual sports include: cross-country skiing, alpine skiing, snowboarding, ski jumping, speed skating, figure skating, luge, skeleton, bobsleigh, ski orienteering and snowmobiling.

Common team sports include ice hockey, ringette, broomball (on either an indoor ice rink, or an outdoor ice rink or field of snow), curling, rinkball, and bandy. Based on the number of participants, ice hockey is the world&#x27;s most popular winter team sport, followed by bandy.

Winter sports at times have their own multi-sport events, such as the Winter Olympic Games and the Winter Universiade.

==History==

Snow and ice during the winter time has enabled sliding as a means of transportation, using sledges, skis and skates. This also led to different pastimes and sports being developed in the winter season as compared to other times of the year. Naturally, winter sports are more popular in countries with longer winter seasons.

In the European Alps, St. Moritz became a popular winter resort in 1864.

In the early days of the Olympics there was not much differentiation between the summer and winter games. These confusions would span from around the late 1890s until the early to mid 1900s. During this time, some sports considered to be winter sports and played or performed during the Olympic Winter Games today, would be held during the Olympic Summer Games. It was originally wanted to keep all of the Olympic sports together under one event and program, but due to environmental demands of some sports, it had to be separated.

While most winter sports are played outside, ice hockey, speed skating and to some extent bandy have moved indoors starting in the mid-20th century. Indoor ice rinks with artificial ice allow ice skating and hockey to be played in hot climates.

Outdoor winter sports will likely be severely impacted because of climate change in the next century.

<text>Roberto Gastone Zeffiro Rossellini (8 May 1906 – 3 June 1977) was an Italian film director, screenwriter and producer. He was one of the most prominent directors of the Italian neorealist cinema, contributing to the movement with films such as &quot;Rome, Open City&quot; (1945), &quot;Paisan&quot; (1946), and &quot;Germany, Year Zero&quot; (1948). He is also known for his films starring Ingrid Bergman, &quot;Stromboli&quot; (1950), &quot;Europe &#x27;51&quot; (1952), &quot;Journey to Italy&quot; (1954), &quot;Fear&quot; (1954) and &quot;Joan of Arc at the Stake&quot; (1954).

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Rossellini was born in Rome. His mother, Elettra (née Bellan), was a housewife born in Rovigo, Veneto, and his father, Angiolo Giuseppe &quot;Peppino&quot; Rossellini, who owned a construction firm, was born in Rome from a family originally from Pisa, Tuscany. His mother was of partial French descent, from immigrants who had arrived in Italy during the Napoleonic Wars. He lived on the Via Ludovisi, where Benito Mussolini had his first Roman hotel in 1922 when Fascism obtained power in Italy.

Rossellini&#x27;s father built the first cinema in Rome, the &quot;Barberini&quot;, a theatre where movies could be projected, granting his son an unlimited free pass; the young Rossellini started frequenting the cinema at an early age. When his father died, he worked in film sound-making and for a certain time, he experienced all the ancillary jobs related to the creation of a film, gaining competence in each field. Rossellini had a younger brother, Renzo, who later scored many of his films.

Although he was not personally religious, he had a strong interest in Christian values in the contemporary world; he appreciated Catholic ethics and religious sentiment—things which he saw as being neglected in the materialist world.

=== Career ===
In 1937, Rossellini shot his first film, &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot;, which was possibly unreleased and later lost. After this film, he was called to work as assistant director on Goffredo Alessandrini&#x27;s in making &quot;Luciano Serra pilota&quot;, one of the most successful Italian films of the first half of the 20th century, and later worked on Francesco De Robertis&#x27;s 1940 film &quot;Uomini sul Fondo&quot;. His close friendship with Vittorio Mussolini, son of Benito Mussolini, has been interpreted as a possible reason for having been preferred to other apprentices.

Some writers have described the first part of his career as a sequence of trilogies. His first feature film, &quot;The White Ship&quot; (1941) was sponsored by the audiovisual propaganda centre of Navy Department and is the first work in Rossellini&#x27;s &quot;Fascist Trilogy&quot;, together with &quot;A Pilot Returns&quot; (1942) and &quot;The Man with a Cross&quot; (1943). During this period he developed relationships with Federico Fellini and Aldo Fabrizi. The Fascist regime collapsed in 1943, and two months after the liberation of Rome (4 June 1944), Rossellini began preparing the anti-fascist &quot;Roma città aperta&quot; (&quot;Rome, Open City&quot;, 1945), with Fellini assisting on the script. Fabrizi played the role of the priest, while Rossellini self-produced, filming commencing in January 1945. Most of the money came from credits and loans, and film had to be found on the black market. This dramatic film was an immediate success. It has been called the first film of the &quot;Neorealist Trilogy&quot;, the second title of which was &quot;Paisà&quot; (1946), produced with non-professional actors, and the third, &quot;Germany, Year Zero&quot; (1948), was sponsored by a French producer and filmed in Berlin&#x27;s French sector. In Berlin also, Rossellini preferred non-actors, but he was unable to find a face he found &quot;interesting&quot;; he placed his camera in the centre of a town square, as he did for &quot;Paisà&quot;, but was surprised when nobody came to watch.

As he declared in an interview &quot;in order to really create the character that one has in mind, it is necessary for the director to engage in a battle with his actor which usually ends with submitting to the actor&#x27;s wish. Since I do not have the desire to waste my energy in a battle like this, I only use professional actors occasionally&quot;. One of the reasons for success is supposed to be Rossellini&#x27;s rewriting of the scripts according to the non-professional actors&#x27; feelings and histories. Regional accent, dialect and costumes were shown in the film as they were in real life.

After his Neorealist Trilogy, Rossellini produced two films now classified as the &#x27;Transitional films&#x27;: &quot;L&#x27;Amore&quot; (1948) (with Anna Magnani) and &quot;La macchina ammazzacattivi&quot; (1952), on the capability of cinema to portray reality and truth (with recalls of commedia dell&#x27;arte). In 1948, Rossellini received a letter from a famous foreign actress proposing a collaboration:
::Dear Mr. Rossellini,
:I saw your films &quot;Open City&quot; and &quot;Paisan&quot;, and enjoyed them very much. If you need a Swedish actress who speaks English very well, who has not forgotten her German, who is not very understandable in French, and who in Italian knows only &quot;ti amo,&quot; I am ready to come and make a film with you.
:::Ingrid Bergman

With this letter began one of the best-known love stories in film history, with Bergman and Rossellini both at the peak of their careers. Their first collaboration was &quot;Stromboli terra di Dio&quot; (1950) (in the island of Stromboli, and its volcano quite conveniently erupted during filming). This affair caused a great scandal in some countries (Bergman and Rossellini were married to other people); the scandal intensified when Bergman became pregnant with Renato Roberto Ranaldo Giusto Giuseppe (&quot;Robin&quot;) Rossellini. Rossellini and Bergman had two more children, Isabella Rossellini (actress &amp; model) and her twin, Ingrid Isotta. &quot;Europa &#x27;51&quot; (1952), &quot;Siamo Donne&quot; (1953), &quot;Journey to Italy&quot; (1954), &quot;La paura&quot; (1954) and &quot;Giovanna d&#x27;Arco al rogo&quot; (1954) were the other films on which they worked together.

In 1957, Jawaharlal Nehru, the prime minister of India at the time, invited him to India to make the documentary &quot;India&quot; and put some life into the floundering Indian Films Division. Though married to Bergman, he had an affair with Sonali Senroy Dasgupta, a screenwriter, herself married to local filmmaker Harisadhan Dasgupta, who was helping develop vignettes for the film. Given the climate of the 1950s, this led to a huge scandal in India as well as in Hollywood. Nehru had to ask Rossellini to leave. Soon after, Bergman and Rossellini separated.

In 1971, Rice University in Houston, Texas, invited Rossellini to help establish a Media Center, where in 1970 he had begun planning a film on science with Rice professor Donald D. Clayton. They worked daily for two weeks in Rome in summer 1970, but financing was insufficient for filming to begin. In 1973, he was invited to teach at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where he taught a one-semester course titled &quot;The Essential Image.&quot;

Rossellini&#x27;s final project was the documentary &quot;Beaubourg&quot;, filmed in 1977 and first premiered in 1983.

=== Personal life ===
In 1934, Rossellini married Assia Noris, a Russian actress who worked in Italian films; the marriage was annulled in 1936. On 26 September 1936, he married Marcella De Marchis (17 January 1916, Rome – 25 February 2009, Sarteano), a costume designer with whom he collaborated even after their marriage was over. De Marchis and Rossellini had two sons: Marco Romano (born 3 July 1937 and died of appendicitis in 1946), and Renzo (born 24 August 1941). Rossellini and De Marchis divorced in 1950.

While filming &quot;Stromboli&quot;, Rossellini had an affair with Ingrid Bergman (who was at the time married to Petter Lindström) in 1949. In the same month the film was released, Bergman gave birth to a boy, Renato Roberto Ranaldo Giusto Giuseppe (&quot;Robin&quot;) Rossellini (born 2 February 1950). A week after their son was born, Bergman divorced Lindström and married Rossellini in Mexico. On 18 June 1952, she gave birth to their twin daughters Isotta Ingrid Rossellini and Isabella Rossellini.

In 1957, Rossellini had an affair with Bengali screenwriter Sonali Dasgupta (née Senroy), and soon after, Bergman and Rossellini separated. Rossellini eloped with Dasgupta in 1957 when she was 27 years old. He adopted her young son Arjun, renamed Gil Rossellini (23 October 1956 – 3 October 2010), who became a New York-based film producer. Rossellini and Dasgupta had a daughter together, Raffaella Rossellini (born 1958), who is an actress and model.

In 1973, Rossellini left Dasgupta for producer Silvia D&#x27;Amico Bendicò, but he remained married to Dasgupta until his death of a heart attack at age 71 in 1977.

=== Global policy ===
Along with Albert Einstein, Rossellini was one of the sponsors of the Peoples&#x27; World Convention (PWC), also known as Peoples&#x27; World Constituent Assembly (PWCA), which took place in 1950-51 at Palais Electoral, Geneva, Switzerland.

==Legacy==
Rossellini&#x27;s films after his early Neo-Realist films—particularly his films with Ingrid Bergman—were commercially unsuccessful, though &quot;Journey to Italy&quot; is well regarded in some quarters. He was an acknowledged master for the critics of &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; in general and André Bazin, François Truffaut, and Jean-Luc Godard in particular. Truffaut noted in his 1963 essay, &quot;Roberto Rossellini Prefers Real Life&quot; (available in &quot;The Films in My Life&quot;) that Rossellini&#x27;s influence among the directors who became part of the nouvelle vague was so great that he was in every sense &quot;the father of the French New Wave&quot;.

His posthumous ex-son-in-law Martin Scorsese has acknowledged Rossellini&#x27;s seminal influence in his documentary &quot;My Voyage to Italy&quot; (the title itself a take on Rossellini&#x27;s &quot;Voyage to Italy&quot;). Among works from Italian directors Fellini, Visconti, De Sica and Antonioni, Rossellini&#x27;s films form at least half of the films Scorsese discusses, highlighting Rossellini&#x27;s monumental role in Italian and world cinema. The films covered include his Neo-Realist films and films with Ingrid Bergman, as well as &quot;The Flowers of St. Francis&quot;, about St. Francis of Assisi. Scorsese notes that in contrast to directors who often become stylistically restrained and conservative as their careers advanced, Rossellini became more unconventional as his career advanced, and was constantly experimenting with new styles and technical challenges. Scorsese particularly highlights the series of biographies Rossellini made in the 60s of historical figures and singles out &quot;La Prise de pouvoir par Louis XIV&quot; for praise. 

Certain of Rossellini&#x27;s film-related material and personal papers are contained in the Wesleyan University Cinema Archives to which scholars and media experts from around the world may have full access. Rossellini&#x27;s son Renzo is producing the &quot;Audiovisual Encyclopedia of History by Roberto Rossellini&quot;, a multi-media collection containing all of Rossellini&#x27;s works, interviews, and other material from the Rossellini archive. The &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; existed in prototype form in 2011.

<text>An inclined plane, also known as a ramp, is a flat supporting surface tilted at an angle from the vertical direction, with one end higher than the other, used as an aid for raising or lowering a load. The inclined plane is one of the six classical simple machines defined by Renaissance scientists. Inclined planes are used to move heavy loads over vertical obstacles. Examples vary from a ramp used to load goods into a truck, to a person walking up a pedestrian ramp, to an automobile or railroad train climbing a grade.

Moving an object up an inclined plane requires less force than lifting it straight up, at a cost of an increase in the distance moved. The mechanical advantage of an inclined plane, the factor by which the force is reduced, is equal to the ratio of the length of the sloped surface to the height it spans. Owing to conservation of energy, the same amount of mechanical energy (work) is required to lift a given object by a given vertical distance, disregarding losses from friction, but the inclined plane allows the same work to be done with a smaller force exerted over a greater distance.

The angle of friction, also sometimes called the angle of repose, is the maximum angle at which a load can rest motionless on an inclined plane due to friction without sliding down. This angle is equal to the arctangent of the coefficient of static friction &quot;μs&quot; between the surfaces.

Two other simple machines are often considered to be derived from the inclined plane. The wedge can be considered a moving inclined plane or two inclined planes connected at the base. The screw consists of a narrow inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder.

The term may also refer to a specific implementation; a straight ramp cut into a steep hillside for transporting goods up and down the hill. This may include cars on rails or pulled up by a cable system; a funicular or cable railway, such as the Johnstown Inclined Plane.

==Uses==
Inclined planes are widely used in the form of &quot;loading ramps&quot; to load and unload goods on trucks, ships and planes. Wheelchair ramps are used to allow people in wheelchairs to get over vertical obstacles without exceeding their strength. Escalators and slanted conveyor belts are also forms of an inclined plane.In a funicular or cable railway a railroad car is pulled up a steep inclined plane using cables. Inclined planes also allow heavy fragile objects, including humans, to be safely lowered down a vertical distance by using the normal force of the plane to reduce the gravitational force. Aircraft evacuation slides allow people to rapidly and safely reach the ground from the height of a passenger airliner.

Other inclined planes are built into permanent structures. Roads for vehicles and railroads have inclined planes in the form of gradual slopes, ramps, and causeways to allow vehicles to surmount vertical obstacles such as hills without losing traction on the road surface. Similarly, pedestrian paths and sidewalks have gentle ramps to limit their slope, to ensure that pedestrians can keep traction. Inclined planes are also used as entertainment for people to slide down in a controlled way, in playground slides, water slides, ski slopes and skateboard parks.

==History==

Inclined planes have been used by people since prehistoric times to move heavy objects. The sloping roads and causeways built by ancient civilizations such as the Romans are examples of early inclined planes that have survived, and show that they understood the value of this device for moving things uphill. The heavy stones used in ancient stone structures such as Stonehenge are believed to have been moved and set in place using inclined planes made of earth, although it is hard to find evidence of such temporary building ramps. The Egyptian pyramids were constructed using inclined planes, Siege ramps enabled ancient armies to surmount fortress walls. The ancient Greeks constructed a paved ramp 6 km (3.7 miles) long, the Diolkos, to drag ships overland across the Isthmus of Corinth.

However the inclined plane was the last of the six classic simple machines to be recognised as a machine. This is probably because it is a passive and motionless device (the load is the moving part), and also because it is found in nature in the form of slopes and hills. Although they understood its use in lifting heavy objects, the ancient Greek philosophers who defined the other five simple machines did not include the inclined plane as a machine. This view persisted among a few later scientists; as late as 1826 Karl von Langsdorf wrote that an inclined plane &quot;...is no more a machine than is the slope of a mountain&quot;. The problem of calculating the force required to push a weight up an inclined plane (its mechanical advantage) was attempted by Greek philosophers Heron of Alexandria (c. 10 - 60 CE) and Pappus of Alexandria (c. 290 - 350 CE), but their solutions were incorrect.

It was not until the Renaissance that the inclined plane was solved mathematically and classed with the other simple machines. The first correct analysis of the inclined plane appeared in the work of 13th century author Jordanus de Nemore, however his solution was apparently not communicated to other philosophers of the time. Girolamo Cardano (1570) proposed the incorrect solution that the input force is proportional to the angle of the plane. Then at the end of the 16th century, three correct solutions were published within ten years, by Michael Varro (1584), Simon Stevin (1586), and Galileo Galilei (1592). Although it was not the first, the derivation of Flemish engineer Simon Stevin is the most well-known, because of its originality and use of a string of beads (see box). In 1600, Italian scientist Galileo Galilei included the inclined plane in his analysis of simple machines in &quot;Le Meccaniche&quot; (&quot;On Mechanics&quot;), showing its underlying similarity to the other machines as a force amplifier.

The first elementary rules of sliding friction on an inclined plane were discovered by Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), but remained unpublished in his notebooks. They were rediscovered by Guillaume Amontons (1699) and were further developed by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1785). Leonhard Euler (1750) showed that the tangent of the angle of repose on an inclined plane is equal to the coefficient of friction.

==Terminology==

===Slope===
The mechanical advantage of an inclined plane depends on its &quot;slope&quot;, meaning its gradient or steepness. The smaller the slope, the larger the mechanical advantage, and the smaller the force needed to raise a given weight. A plane&#x27;s slope &quot;s&quot; is equal to the difference in height between its two ends, or &quot;&quot;rise&quot;, divided by its horizontal length, or &quot;run&quot;&quot;. It can also be expressed by the angle the plane makes with the horizontal, formula_1.
 
:formula_2

===Mechanical advantage===
The mechanical advantage formula_3 of a simple machine as defined as the ratio of the output force exerted on the load to the input force applied. The inclined plane the output load force is just the gravitational force of the load object on the plane, its weight formula_4. The input force is the force formula_5 exerted on the object, parallel to the plane, to move it up the plane. The mechanical advantage is

:formula_6

The formula_3 of an ideal inclined plane without friction is sometimes called &quot;ideal mechanical advantage&quot; formula_8 while the MA when friction is included is called the &quot;actual mechanical advantage&quot; formula_9.

==Frictionless inclined plane==
If there is no friction between the object being moved and the plane, the device is called an &quot;ideal inclined plane&quot;. This condition might be approached if the object is rolling like a barrel, or supported on wheels or casters. Due to conservation of energy, for a frictionless inclined plane the work done on the load lifting it, formula_10, is equal to the work done by the input force, formula_11

:formula_12

Work is defined as the force multiplied by the displacement an object moves. The work done on the load is equal to its weight multiplied by the vertical displacement it rises, which is the &quot;rise&quot; of the inclined plane
:formula_13
The input work is equal to the force formula_5 on the object times the diagonal length of the inclined plane. 
:formula_15
Substituting these values into the conservation of energy equation above and rearranging

:formula_16

To express the mechanical advantage by the angle formula_1 of the plane, it can be seen from the diagram &quot;(above)&quot; that
:formula_18
So
:formula_19

So the mechanical advantage of a frictionless inclined plane is equal to the reciprocal of the sine of the slope angle. The input force formula_20 from this equation is the force needed to hold the load motionless on the inclined plane, or push it up at a constant velocity. If the input force is greater than this, the load will accelerate up the plane. If the force is less, it will accelerate down the plane.

==Inclined plane with friction==
Where there is friction between the plane and the load, as for example with a heavy box being slid up a ramp, some of the work applied by the input force is dissipated as heat by friction, formula_21, so less work is done on the load. Due to conservation of energy, the sum of the output work and the frictional energy losses is equal to the input work 
:formula_22
Therefore, more input force is required, and the mechanical advantage is lower, than if friction were not present.
With friction, the load will only move if the net force parallel to the surface is greater than the frictional force formula_23 opposing it. The maximum friction force is given by 
:formula_24
where formula_25 is the normal force between the load and the plane, directed normal to the surface, and formula_26 is the coefficient of static friction between the two surfaces, which varies with the material. When no input force is applied, if the inclination angle formula_1 of the plane is less than some maximum value formula_28 the component of gravitational force parallel to the plane will be too small to overcome friction, and the load will remain motionless. This angle is called the angle of repose and depends on the composition of the surfaces, but is independent of the load weight. It is shown below that the tangent of the angle of repose formula_28 is equal to formula_26 
:formula_31
With friction, there is always some range of input force formula_5 for which the load is stationary, neither sliding up or down the plane, whereas with a frictionless inclined plane there is only one particular value of input force for which the load is stationary.

===Analysis===
A load resting on an inclined plane, when considered as a free body has three forces acting on it:
*The applied force, formula_5 exerted on the load to move it, which acts parallel to the inclined plane.
*The weight of the load, formula_4, which acts vertically downwards
*The force of the plane on the load. This can be resolved into two components:
**The normal force formula_25 of the inclined plane on the load, supporting it. This is directed perpendicular (normal) to the surface.
**The frictional force, formula_23 of the plane on the load acts parallel to the surface, and is always in a direction opposite to the motion of the object. It is equal to the normal force multiplied by the coefficient of static friction μ between the two surfaces.
Using Newton&#x27;s second law of motion the load will be stationary or in steady motion if the sum of the forces on it is zero. Since the direction of the frictional force is opposite for the case of uphill and downhill motion, these two cases must be considered separately: 
*Uphill motion: The total force on the load is toward the uphill side, so the frictional force is directed down the plane, opposing the input force.

:The mechanical advantage is
:formula_37

:where formula_31. This is the condition for &quot;impending motion&quot; up the inclined plane. If the applied force Fi is greater than given by this equation, the load will move up the plane.

*Downhill motion: The total force on the load is toward the downhill side, so the frictional force is directed up the plane.

:The mechanical advantage is
:formula_39
:This is the condition for impending motion down the plane; if the applied force Fi is less than given in this equation, the load will slide down the plane. There are three cases:
:#formula_40: The mechanical advantage is negative. In the absence of applied force the load will remain motionless, and requires some negative (downhill) applied force to slide down.
:#formula_41: The &#x27;angle of repose&#x27;. The mechanical advantage is infinite. With no applied force, load will not slide, but the slightest negative (downhill) force will cause it to slide.
:#formula_42: The mechanical advantage is positive. In the absence of applied force the load will slide down the plane, and requires some positive (uphill) force to hold it motionless

==Mechanical advantage using power==

The mechanical advantage of an inclined plane is the ratio of the weight of the load on the ramp to the force required to pull it up the ramp. If energy is not dissipated or stored in the movement of the load, then this mechanical advantage can be computed from the dimensions of the ramp.

In order to show this, let the position r of a rail car on along the ramp with an angle, &quot;θ&quot;, above the horizontal be given by
:formula_43

where &quot;R&quot; is the distance along the ramp. The velocity of the car up the ramp is now

:formula_44

Because there are no losses, the power used by force &quot;F&quot; to move the load up the ramp equals the power out, which is the vertical lift of the weight &quot;W&quot; of the load.

The input power pulling the car up the ramp is given by

:formula_45

and the power out is

:formula_46

Equate the power in to the power out to obtain the mechanical advantage as

:formula_47

The mechanical advantage of an inclined plane can also be calculated from the ratio of length of the ramp &quot;L&quot; to its height &quot;H,&quot; because the sine of the angle of the ramp is given by
:formula_48
therefore,
:formula_49

Example: If the height of a ramp is H = 1 meter and its length is L = 5 meters, then the mechanical advantage is
:formula_50
which means that a 20 lb force will lift a 100 lb load.

The Liverpool Minard inclined plane has the dimensions 1804 meters by 37.50 meters, which provides a mechanical advantage of
:formula_51
so a 100 lb tension force on the cable will lift a 4810 lb load. The grade of this incline is 2%, which means the angle θ is small enough that sin θ≈tan θ.

<text>Snowboarding is a recreational and competitive activity that involves descending a snow-covered surface while standing on a snowboard that is almost always attached to a rider&#x27;s feet. It features in the Winter Olympic Games and Winter Paralympic Games.

Snowboarding was developed in the United States, inspired by skateboarding, sledding, surfing, and skiing. It became popular around the world and was introduced as a Winter Olympic Sport at Nagano in 1998 and featured in the Winter Paralympics at Sochi in 2014. , its popularity (as measured by equipment sales) in the United States peaked in 2007 and has been in a decline since.

==History==


The first snowboards were developed in 1965 when Sherm Poppen, an engineer in Muskegon, Michigan, invented a toy for his daughters by fastening two skis together and attaching a rope to one end so he would have some control as they stood on the board and glided downhill. Dubbed the &quot;snurfer&quot; (combining snow and surfer) by his wife Nancy, the toy proved so popular among his daughters&#x27; friends that Poppen licensed the idea to a manufacturer, Brunswick Corporation, that sold about a million snurfers over the next decade. And, in 1966 alone, over half a million snurfers were sold.

Modern snowboarding was pioneered by Tom Sims and Jake Burton Carpenter, who both contributed significant innovations and started influential companies. In February 1968, Poppen organized the first snurfing competition at a Michigan ski resort that attracted enthusiasts from all over the country. One of those early pioneers was Tom Sims, a devotee of skateboarding (a sport born in the 1950s when kids attached roller skate wheels to small boards that they steered by shifting their weight). In the 1960s, as an eighth grader in Haddonfield, New Jersey, Sims crafted a snowboard in his school shop class by gluing carpet to the top of a piece of wood and attaching aluminum sheeting to the bottom. He produced commercial snowboards in the mid-70s including the &quot;Skiboard&quot; (also known as the &quot;Lonnie Toft flying banana&quot;) a molded polyethylene bottom with a Lonnie Toft signature skateboard deck attached to the top. Others experimented with board-on-snow configurations at this time, including Welsh skateboard enthusiasts Jon Roberts and Pete Matthews developed their own snowboards to use at their local dry ski slope.

Also during this same period, in 1977, Jake Burton Carpenter, a Vermont native who had enjoyed snurfing since the age of 14, impressed the crowd at a Michigan snurfing competition with bindings he had designed to secure his feet to the board. That same year, he founded Burton Snowboards in Londonderry, Vermont. The &quot;snowboards&quot; were made of wooden planks that were flexible and had water ski foot traps. Very few people picked up snowboarding because the price of the board was considered too high at $38 and were not allowed on many ski hills, but eventually Burton would become the biggest snowboarding company in the business. Burton&#x27;s early designs for boards with bindings became the dominant features in snowboarding.

The first competitions to offer prize money were the National Snurfing Championship, held at Muskegon State Park in Muskegon, Michigan. In 1979, Jake Burton Carpenter came from Vermont to compete with a snowboard of his own design. There were protests about Jake entering with a non-snurfer board. Paul Graves, and others, advocated that Jake be allowed to race. A &quot;modified&quot; &quot;Open&quot; division was created and won by Jake as the sole entrant. That race was considered the first competition for snowboarding and is the start of what became competitive snowboarding. Ken Kampenga, John Asmussen and Jim Trim placed first, second and third respectively in the Standard competition with best two combined times of 24.71, 25.02 and 25.41; and Jake Carpenter won prize money as the sole entrant in the &quot;open&quot; division with a time of 26.35. In 1980 the event moved to Pando Winter Sports Park near Grand Rapids, Michigan, because of a lack of snow that year at the original venue.

In the early 1980s, Aleksey Ostatnigrosh and Alexei Melnikov, two Snurfers from the Soviet Union, patented design changes to the Snurfer to allow jumping by attaching a bungee cord, a single footed binding to the Snurfer tail, and a two-foot binding design for improved control.

As snowboarding became more popular in the 1970s and 1980s, pioneers such as Dimitrije Milovich (founder of Winterstick out of Salt Lake City, Utah), Jake Burton Carpenter (founder of Burton Snowboards from Londonderry, Vermont), Tom Sims (founder of Sims Snowboards), David Kemper (founder of Kemper Snowboards) and Mike Olson (founder of Gnu Snowboards) came up with new designs for boards and mechanisms that slowly developed into the snowboards and other related equipment. From these developments, modern snowboarding equipment usually consists of a snowboard with specialized bindings and boots.

In April 1981, the &quot;King of the Mountain&quot; Snowboard competition was held at Ski Cooper in Colorado. Tom Sims along with an assortment of other snowboarders of the time were present. One entrant showed up on a homemade snowboard with a formica bottom that turned out to not slide so well on the snow.

In 1982, the first USA National Snowboard race was held near Woodstock, Vermont, at Suicide Six. The race, organized by Graves, was won by Burton&#x27;s first team rider Doug Bouton.

In 1983, the first World Championship halfpipe competition was held at Soda Springs, California. Tom Sims, founder of Sims Snowboards, organized the event with the help of Mike Chantry, a snowboard instructor at Soda Springs.

In 1985, the first World Cup was held in Zürs, Austria, further cementing snowboarding&#x27;s recognition as an official international competitive sport.

In 1990, the International Snowboard Federation (ISF) was founded to provide universal contest regulations. In addition, the United States of America Snowboard Association (USASA) provides instructing guidelines and runs snowboard competitions in the U.S. today, high-profile snowboarding events like the Winter X Games, Air &amp; Style, US Open, Olympic Games and other events are broadcast worldwide. Many alpine resorts have terrain parks.

At the 1998 Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan, Snowboarding became an official Olympic event. France&#x27;s Karine Ruby was the first to win an Olympic gold medal for Woman&#x27;s Snowboarding, while Canadian Ross Rebagliati was the first for Men&#x27;s Snowboarding.

Initially, ski areas adopted the sport at a much slower pace than the winter sports public. Indeed, for many years, there was animosity between skiers and snowboarders, which led to an ongoing skier vs snowboarder feud. Early snowboards were banned from the slopes by park officials. For several years snowboarders would have to take a small skills assessment prior to being allowed to ride the chairlifts. It was thought that an unskilled snowboarder would wipe the snow off the mountain. In 1985, only seven percent of U.S. ski areas allowed snowboarding, with a similar proportion in Europe. As equipment and skills improved, gradually snowboarding became more accepted. In 1990, most major ski areas had separate slopes for snowboarders. Now, approximately 97% of all ski areas in North America and Europe allow snowboarding, and more than half have jumps, rails and half pipes.

In 2008, snowboarding had over 5 million participants, most aged between 18 and 24, with women comprising 25% of participants.

There were 8.2 million snowboarders in the US and Canada for the 2009–2010 season. There was a 10% increase over the previous season, accounting for more than 30% of all snow sports participants.

On 2 May 2012, the International Paralympic Committee announced that adaptive snowboarding (dubbed &quot;para-snowboarding&quot;) would debut as a men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s medal event in the 2014 Paralympic Winter Games taking place in Sochi, Russia.

==Styles==
Since snowboarding&#x27;s inception as an established winter sport, it has developed various styles, each with its own specialized equipment and technique. The most common styles today are: freeride, freestyle, and freecarve/race. These styles are used for both recreational and professional snowboarding. While each style is unique, there is overlap between them.

===Jibbing===

&quot;Jibbing&quot; is the term for technical riding on non-standard surfaces. The word &quot;jib&quot; is both a noun and a verb, depending on the usage of the word. As a noun: a jib includes metal rails, boxes, benches, concrete ledges, walls, vehicles, rocks and logs. As a verb: to jib is referring to the action of jumping, sliding, or riding on top of objects other than snow. It is directly influenced by grinding a skateboard. Jibbing is a freestyle snowboarding technique of riding. Typically jibbing occurs in a snowboard resort park but can also be done in urban environments.

===Freeriding===

Freeriding is a style without a set of governing rules or set course, typically on natural, un-groomed terrain. The basic allows for various snowboarding styles in a fluid motion and spontaneity through naturally rugged terrain. It can be like freestyle with the exception that no man-made features are utilized. &quot;See also Backcountry snowboarding.&quot;

===Freestyle===
Freestyle snowboarding is any riding that includes performing tricks. In freestyle, the rider utilizes natural and man-made features such as rails, jumps, boxes, and innumerable others to perform tricks. It is a popular all-inclusive concept that distinguishes the creative aspects of snowboarding, in contrast to a style like alpine snowboarding.

===Alpine snowboarding===
Alpine snowboarding is a discipline within the sport of snowboarding. It is practiced on groomed pistes. It has been an Olympic event since 1998.

Sometimes called freecarving or hardbooting (due to the equipment used), this discipline usually takes place on hard packed snow or groomed runs (although it can be practiced in any and all conditions) and focuses on carving linked turns, much like surfing or longboarding. Little or no jumping takes place in this discipline. Alpine Snowboarding consists of a small portion of the general snowboard population, that has a well connected social community and its own specific board manufacturers, most situated in Europe. Alpine Snowboard equipment includes a ski-like hardshell boot and plate binding system with a true directional snowboard that is stiffer and narrower to manage linking turns with greater forces and speed. Shaped skis can thank these &quot;freecarve&quot; snowboards for the cutting-edge technology leading to their creation. A skilled alpine snowboarder can link numerous turns into a run placing their body very close to the ground each turn, similar to a motocross turn or waterski carve. Depending on factors including stiffness, turning radius and personality this can be done slowly or fast. Carvers make perfect half-circles out of each turn, changing edges when the snowboard is perpendicular to the fall line and starting every turn on the downhill edge. Carving on a snowboard is like riding a roller coaster, because the board will lock into a turn radius and provide what feels like multiple Gs of acceleration.

Alpine snowboarding shares more visual similarities with skiing equipment than it does with snowboarding equipment. Compared to freestyle snowboarding gear:
* Boards are narrower, longer, and stiffer to improve carving performance
* Boots are made from a hard plastic shell, making it flex differently from a regular snowboard boot and is designed differently to ski boots although they look similar.
* Bindings have a bail or step-in design and are sometimes placed on suspension plates to provide a layer of isolation between an alpine snowboarder and the board, to decrease the level of vibrations felt by the rider, creating a better overall experience when carving, and to give extra weight to the board among other uses. 
===Slopestyle===

Competitors perform tricks while descending a course, moving around, over, across, up, or down terrain features. The course is full of obstacles including boxes, rails, jumps, jibs, or anything else the board or rider can slide across. Slopestyle is a judged event and winning a Slopestyle contest usually comes from successfully executing the most difficult line in the terrain park while having a smooth flowing line of difficult, mistake-free tricks performed on the obstacles. However, overall impression and style can play a factor in winning a Slopestyle contest and the rider who lands the hardest tricks will not always win over the rider who lands easier tricks on more difficult paths.

===Big air===

Big air competitions are contests where riders perform tricks after launching off a man-made jump built specifically for the event. Competitors perform tricks in the air, aiming to attain sizable height and distance, all while securing a clean landing. Many competitions also require the rider to do a complex trick. Not all competitions call for a trick to win the gold; some intermittent competitions are based solely on height and distance of the launch of the snowboarder. Some competitions also require the rider to do a specific trick to win the major prize. One of the first snowboard competitions where Travis Rice attempted and landed a &quot;double back flip backside 180&quot; took place at the 2006 Red Bull Gap Session.

===Half-pipe===

The half-pipe is a semi-circular ditch dug into the mountain or purpose-built ramp made up of snow, with walls between 8 and . Competitors perform tricks while going from one side to the other and while in the air above the sides of the pipe.

===Snowboard cross===

Snowboard cross, also known as &quot;boardercross&quot;, &quot;boarder X&quot;, or &quot;snowboard X&quot;, and commonly abbreviated as &quot;SBX&quot;, or just &quot;BX&quot;, is a snowboarding discipline consisting of several (typically 4 to 6) riders racing head-to-head down a course with jumps, berms and other obstacles constructed out of snow. Snowboard cross began in the 1980s, earning its place as an official Winter Olympic event in the 2006 Turin games. Unlike other snowboard racing disciplines such as parallel giant slalom, competitors race on a single course together.

===Snowboard racing===

In snowboard racing, riders must complete a downhill course constructed of a series of turning color indicators (gates) placed in the snow at prescribed distances apart. A gate consists of a tall pole and a short pole, connected by a triangular panel. The racer must pass around the short side of the gate, passing the long side of the gate doesn&#x27;t count. There are 3 main formats used in snowboard racing including single person, parallel courses or multiple people on the course at the same time (SBX).

==Competitions==
Snowboarding contests are held throughout the world and range from grassroots competitions to professional events contested worldwide.
Some of the larger snowboarding contests include: the European Air &amp; Style, the Japanese X-Trail Jam, Burton Global Open Series, Shakedown, FIS World Championships, the annual FIS World Cup, the Winter X Games, Freeride World Tour and the Winter Dew Tour.

Snowboarding has been a Winter Olympic sport since 1998 Winter Olympics in Japan. Since its inauguration, Olympic snowboarding has seen many additions and removals of events. During the 2018 Winter Olympics, snowboarding events contested included big air, halfpipe, parallel giant slalom, slopestyle and snowboard cross.

&quot;Snowboarder Magazine&quot; Superpark event was created in 1996. Over 150 of the World&#x27;s top pros are invited to advance freestyle snowboarding on the most progressive terrain parks.

Part of the snowboarding approach is to ensure maximum fun, friendship and event quality. Reflecting this perspective of snowboarding, there are &quot;Anti Contests&quot; which are an important part of its identity. These include the Holy Oly Revival at The Summit at Snoqualmie, The Nate Chute Hawaiian Classic at Whitefish, the original anti-contest, the World Quarterpipe Championships and the Grenade Games.

The United States of America Snowboarding and Freeski Association (USASA), the first governing body for grassroots snowboarding, runs 30 regional series and national championships in the US.

==Subculture==

The snowboarding way of life came about as a natural response to the culture from which it emerged. Early on, there was a rebellion against skiing culture and the view that snowboarders were inferior. Skiers did not easily accept this new culture on their slopes. The two cultures contrasted each other in several ways including how they spoke, acted, and their entire style of clothing. Snowboarders first embraced the punk and later the hip-hop look into their style. Words such as &quot;dude&quot;, &quot;gnarly&quot;, and &quot;Shred the Gnar&quot; are some examples of words used in the snowboarding culture. Snowboarding subculture became a crossover between the urban and suburban styles on snow, which made an easy transition from surfing and skateboarding culture over to snowboarding culture. In fact many skateboarders and surfers snowboarded in the winter months and were the early snowboarders.

The early stereotypes of snowboarding included &quot;lazy&quot;, &quot;grungy&quot;, &quot;punk&quot;, &quot;stoners&quot;, &quot;troublemakers&quot;, and numerous others, many of which are associated with skateboarding and surfing as well. However, these stereotypes may be considered out of style. Snowboarding has become a sport that encompasses a very diverse international based crowd and fanbase of many millions, so much so that it is no longer possible to stereotype such a large community. Reasons for these dying stereotypes include how mainstream and popular the sport has become, with the shock factor of snowboarding&#x27;s quick take off on the slopes wearing off. Skiers and snowboarders are becoming used to each other, showing more respect to each other on the mountain. &quot;The typical stereotype of the sport is changing as the demographics change&quot;. While these two subcultures are now becoming accustomed to each other, there are still three resorts, in the United States, which do not allow snowboarding. Alta, Deer Valley, and Mad River Glen are the last skiing only resorts in North America and have become a focal point over time for the remaining animosity between snowboarding and skiing.

== Common injuries ==
Common injuries in snowboarding differ between professional and recreational groups. The most common type of injury for snowboarders is injury to the upper body. In recreational snowboarding, wrist injuries are more likely to occur. Among professional snowboarders, injuries to the lower half, specifically the knee joint, are more likely to occur. When injured, snowboarders are twice as likely to get a fracture as skiers. Other minor injuries that happen are &quot;wrist injuries, shoulder soft tissue injuries, ankle injuries, concussions, and clavicle fractures, were seen injuries are very common when snowboarding&quot;. In recreational and inexperienced &quot;most injuries to snowboarders occurred more often while they were traveling at reckless speed on moderate slopes&quot;. Another way injuries happen is because they try sticking with someone that is a higher skill level, which they are not capable of handling because of the lack of skill they possess. Some major injuries that occur during snowboarding are head, and spinal injuries, &quot;the main cause of spinal fractures in snowboarders was jump landing failure and compression type fractures occur in about 80% of snowboarders with vertebral fractures because they frequently fall backwards, and this can cause axial loading and anterior compression fractures&quot;. Injuries to the upper body are much less common among professional snowboarders. &quot;Most of the professionals and elite snowboarders frequently sustain injuries when trying to execute challenging tricks at high speeds and with increased levels of force to the lower limbs&quot;.

==Safety and precautions==

Like some other winter sports, snowboarding comes with a certain level of risk.

The average snowboarder is a male in their early twenties, and there are three times as many men as there are women in the sport. Snowboarders have a 2.4 times greater risk of fractures than skiers, particularly in the upper extremities. Conversely, snowboarders have a lower risk of knee injuries than skiers. The injury rate for snowboarding is about four to six per thousand persons per day, which is around double the injury rate for alpine skiing. Injuries are more likely amongst beginners, especially those who do not take lessons with professional instructors. A quarter of all injuries occur to first-time riders and half of all injuries occur to those with less than a year of experience. Experienced riders are less likely to suffer injury, but the injuries that do occur tend to be more severe.

Two-thirds of injuries occur to the upper body and one-third to the lower body. This contrasts with alpine skiing, where two-thirds of injuries are to the lower body. The most common types of injuries are sprains, which account for around 40% of injuries. The most common point of injury is the wrists – 40% of all snowboard injuries are to the wrists and 24% of all snowboard injuries are wrist fractures. There are around 100,000 wrist fractures worldwide among snowboarders each year. For this reason the use of wrist guards, either separate or built into gloves, is very strongly recommended. They are often compulsory in beginner&#x27;s classes and their use reduces the likelihood of wrist injury by half. In addition it is important for snow boarders to learn how to fall without stopping the fall with their hand by trying to &quot;push&quot; the slope away, as landing a wrist which is bent at a 90-degree angle increase the chance of it breaking. Rather, landing with the arms stretched out (like a wing) and slapping the slope with the entire arm is an effective way to break a fall. This is the method used by practitioners of judo and other martial arts to break a fall when they are thrown against the floor by a training partner.

The risk of head injury is two to six times greater for snowboarders than for skiers and injuries follow the pattern of being rarer, but more severe, with experienced riders. Head injuries can occur both because of a collision and when failing to carry out a heel-side turn. The latter can result in the rider landing on his or her back and slamming the back of his or her head onto the ground, resulting in an occipital head injury. For this reason, helmets are widely recommended. Protective eyewear is also recommended as eye injury can be caused by impact and snow blindness can be a result of exposure to strong ultra-violet light in snow-covered areas. The wearing of ultra-violet-absorbing goggles is recommended even on hazy or cloudy days as ultra-violet light can penetrate clouds.

Unlike ski bindings, snowboard bindings are not designed to release automatically in a fall. The mechanical support provided by the feet being locked to the board has the effect of reducing the likelihood of knee injury – 15% of snowboard injuries are to the knee, compared with 45% of all skiing injuries. Such injuries are typically to the knee ligaments, bone fractures are rare. Fractures to the lower leg are also rare but 20% of injuries are to the foot and ankle. Fractures of the talus bone are rare in other sports but account for 2% of snowboard injuries – a lateral process talus fracture is sometimes called &quot;snowboarder&#x27;s ankle&quot; by medical staff. This injury results in persistent lateral pain in the affected ankle yet is difficult to spot in a plain X-ray image. It may be misdiagnosed as just a sprain, with possibly serious consequences as not treating the fracture can result in serious long-term damage to the ankle. The use of portable ultrasound for mountainside diagnostics has been reviewed and appears to be a plausible tool for diagnosing some of the common injuries associated with the sport.

Four to eight percent of snowboarding injuries take place while the person is waiting in ski-lift lines or entering and exiting ski lifts. Snowboarders push themselves forward with a free foot while in the ski-lift line, leaving the other foot (usually that of the lead leg) locked on the board at a 9–27 degree angle, placing a large torque force on this leg and predisposing the person to knee injury if a fall occurs. Snowboard binding rotating devices are designed to minimize the torque force, Quick Stance being the first developed in 1995. They allow snowboarders to turn the locked foot straight into the direction of the tip of the snowboard without removing the boot from the boot binding.

Avalanches are a clear danger when on snowy mountain slopes.
It is best to learn the different kinds of avalanches, how to prevent causing one and how to react when one is going to happen. Also when going out onto the snow, all who practice an activity with increased chances of injury should have a basic First Aid knowledge and know how to deal with injuries that may occur.

Snowboarding boots should be well-fitted, with toes snug in the end of the boot when standing upright and slightly away from the end when in the snowboarding position. Padding or &quot;armor&quot; is recommended on other body parts such as hips, knees, spine, and shoulders. To further help avoid injury to body parts, especially knees, it is recommended to use the right technique. To acquire the right technique, one should be taught by a qualified instructor. Also, when snowboarding alone, precaution should be taken to avoid tree wells, a particularly dangerous area of loose snow that may form at the base of trees.

Some care is also required when waxing a board as fluorocarbon waxes emit toxic fumes when overheated. Waxing is best performed in a ventilated area with care being taken to use the wax at the correct temperature – the wax should be melted but not smoking or smoldering.

In a study conducted to examine the types of snowboarding injuries and changes in injury patterns over time, data was collected on injured snowboarders and skiers in a base-lodge clinic of a ski resort in Vermont over 18 seasons (1988–2006) and included extensive information about injury patterns, demographics, and experience. In conclusion of the study, the highest rate of injury was among young, inexperienced, female snowboarders. Injury rates in snowboarders have fluctuated over time but still remain higher than skiers. No evidence was found that those who spend more time in terrain parks are over represented in the injury population.

== Terminology ==

=== Stances===
The way in which a snowboarder normally rides most on their snowboard as determined by the placement of their feet and direction of travel.




=== Parts of a snowboard ===





=== Rotations ===




=== Flips ===






=== Off-axis rotations ===

Off-Axis rotations combine flips and rotations; the naming convention is to first describe the horizontal rotation, followed by the number of off-axis rotations, terminated by the degree of total rotation (i.e. Backside Triple-Cork 1440).


==Media==

===Films===
Snowboarding films have become a main part of progression in the sport. Each season, many films are released, usually in autumn. These are made by many snowboard-specific video production companies as well as manufacturing companies that use these films as a form of advertisement. Snowboarding videos usually contain video footage of professional riders sponsored by companies. An example of commercial use of snowboarding films would be &quot;The White Album&quot;, a film by snowboarding legend and filmmaker Dave Seoane about Shaun White, that includes cameos by Tony Hawk and was sponsored by PlayStation, Mountain Dew and Burton Snowboards. Snowboarding films are also used as documentation of snowboarding and showcasing of current trends and styles of the sport. In addition, the 2011 movie &quot;The Art of Flight&quot; showcased snowboarders such as Travis Rice attempting to attain greater feats in the sport of snowboarding.

However, sometimes the snowboarding industry is not supportive of all snowboarding-themed films. In 2013, &quot;The Crash Reel&quot;, a feature-length documentary by filmmaker Lucy Walker about former Shaun White rival Kevin Pearce, premiered on the film festival circuit to critical acclaim and was subsequently broadcast on HBO. Using Pearce&#x27;s career-ending traumatic brain injury and subsequent recovery as a backdrop, the film examines the physical dangers inherent to pro snowboarders and other extreme sports professional athletes under pressure by sponsors and the media to perform increasingly spectacular feats. Although there are significant references to various brands in the film, Walker is &quot;adamant&quot; that the snowboarding industry did not sponsor the film in any way and in fact has been unsupportive, despite the film&#x27;s mainstream media success.

===Magazines===
Snowboard magazines are integral in promoting the sport, although less so with the advent of the internet age. Photo incentives are written into many professional riders&#x27; sponsorship contracts giving professionals not only a publicity but a financial incentive to have a photo published in a magazine. Snowboard magazine staff travel with professional riders throughout the winter season and cover travel, contests, lifestyle, rider and company profiles, and product reviews. Snowboard magazines have recently made a push to expand their brands to the online market, and there has also been a growth in online-only publications.

<text>The picometre (international spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures; SI symbol: pm) or picometer (American spelling) is a unit of length in the International System of Units (SI), equal to , or one trillionth of a metre, which is the SI base unit of length.

The picometre is one thousand femtometres, one thousandth of a nanometre ( nm), one millionth of a micrometre (also known as a micron), one billionth of a millimetre, and one trillionth of a metre. The symbol μμ was once used for it. It is also one hundredth of an ångström, an internationally known (but non-SI) unit of length.

==Use==
The picometre&#x27;s length is of an order so small that its application is almost entirely confined to particle physics, quantum physics, chemistry, and acoustics. Atoms are between 62 and 520 pm in diameter, and the typical length of a carbon–carbon single bond is 154 pm. Smaller units still may be used to describe smaller particles (some of which are the components of atoms themselves), such as hadrons and the upper limits of possible size for fermion point particles.

The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) probe is planned for launch in 2034 to directly detect gravitational waves and will measure relative displacements with a resolution of 20 picometres over a distance of 2.5 gigametres, yielding a strain sensitivity of better than 1 part in 1020.

<doc id="38965" wikidata="Q83410" url="?curid=38965" title="Cary Grant">
<text>Cary Grant (né Archibald Alec Leach; January 18, 1904November 29, 1986) was an English and American actor. Known for his blended British and American accent, debonair demeanor, lighthearted approach to acting, and sense of comic timing, he was one of classic Hollywood&#x27;s definitive leading men. He was nominated twice for the Academy Award, received an Academy Honorary Award in 1970, and received the Kennedy Center Honor in 1981. He was named the second greatest male star of the Golden Age of Hollywood by the American Film Institute in 1999.

Grant was born into an impoverished family in Bristol, where he had an unhappy childhood marked by the absence of his mother and his father&#x27;s alcoholism. He became attracted to theatre at a young age when he visited the Bristol Hippodrome. At 16, he went as a stage performer with the Pender Troupe for a tour of the US. After a series of successful performances in New York City, he decided to stay there. He established a name for himself in vaudeville in the 1920s and toured the United States before moving to Hollywood in the early 1930s.

Grant initially appeared in crime films and dramas, such as &quot;Blonde Venus&quot; (1932) and &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot; (1933), but later gained renown for his performances in romantic screwball comedies such as &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; (1937), &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938), &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (1940), and &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940). These pictures are frequently cited among the greatest comedy films of all time. Other well-known films in which he starred in this period were the adventure &quot;Gunga Din&quot; (1939), the dark comedy &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; (1944), and the dramas &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot; (1939), &quot;Penny Serenade&quot; (1941), and &quot;None but the Lonely Heart&quot; (1944), the latter two for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

During the 1940s and 1950s, Grant had a close working relationship with director Alfred Hitchcock, who cast him in four films: &quot;Suspicion&quot; (1941), &quot;Notorious&quot; (1946), &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; (1955), and &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959). For the suspense-dramas &quot;Suspicion&quot; and &quot;Notorious&quot;, Grant took on darker, morally ambiguous characters, both challenging Grant&#x27;s screen persona and his acting abilities. Toward the end of his career he starred in the romantic films &quot;Indiscreet&quot; (1958), &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; (1959), &quot;That Touch of Mink&quot; (1962), and &quot;Charade&quot; (1963). He is remembered by critics for his unusually broad appeal as a handsome, suave actor who did not take himself too seriously, and in comedies was able to toy with his dignity without sacrificing it entirely.

Grant was married five times, three of them elopements with actresses Virginia Cherrill (1934–1935), Betsy Drake (1949–1962), and Dyan Cannon (1965–1968). He had daughter Jennifer Grant with Cannon. He retired from film acting in 1966 and pursued numerous business interests, representing cosmetics firm Fabergé and sitting on the board of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He died of a stroke in 1986 at the age of 82.

== Early life and education ==
Grant was born Archibald Alec Leach on January 18, 1904, at 15 Hughenden Road in the northern Bristol, England suburb of Horfield. He was the second child of Elias James Leach and Elsie Maria Leach (née Kingdon). His father worked as a tailor&#x27;s presser at a clothes factory, while his mother worked as a seamstress. His older brother John William Elias Leach died of tuberculous meningitis two days before his first birthday. Grant may have considered himself partly Jewish. He had an unhappy upbringing; his father was an alcoholic and his mother had clinical depression.

Grant&#x27;s mother taught him song and dance when he was four, and she was keen on his having piano lessons. She occasionally took him to the cinema, where he enjoyed the performances of Charlie Chaplin, Chester Conklin, Fatty Arbuckle, Ford Sterling, Mack Swain, and Broncho Billy Anderson. He moved a short distance to 50 Berkeley Road at about age 4, and was sent to Bishop Road Primary School when he was . He lived at six addresses in Bristol, but said his time at Berkeley Road were his childhood &quot;happiest days&quot;.

Grant&#x27;s biographer Graham McCann claimed that his mother &quot;did not know how to give affection and did not know how to receive it either&quot;. Biographer Geoffrey Wansell notes that his mother blamed herself bitterly for the death of Grant&#x27;s brother John, and never recovered from it. Grant acknowledged that his negative experiences with his mother affected his relationships with women later in life. She frowned on alcohol and tobacco, and would reduce pocket money for minor mishaps. Grant attributed her behavior to overprotectiveness, fearing that she would lose him as she did John.

When Grant was nine, his father placed his mother in Glenside Hospital, a mental institution, and told him she had gone away on a &quot;long holiday&quot;, later declaring that she had died. Grant grew up resenting his mother, particularly after being told she left the family. After she was institutionalised, Grant and his father moved into Grant&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s home in Bristol. When Grant was ten, his father remarried and started a new family. Grant did not learn that his mother was still alive until he was 31, his father confessing to the lie shortly before his own death. Grant made arrangements for his mother to leave the institution in June 1935, shortly after he learned of her whereabouts. He visited her regularly, including after filming &quot;Gunga Din&quot; in October 1938.

Grant enjoyed the theater, particularly pantomimes at Christmas, which he attended with his father. He befriended a troupe of acrobatic dancers known as The Penders or the Bob Pender Stage Troupe. He subsequently trained as a stilt walker and began touring with them. Jesse Lasky was a Broadway producer at the time and saw Grant performing at the Wintergarten theater in Berlin around 1914.
In 1915, Grant won a scholarship to attend Fairfield Grammar School in Bristol, although his father could barely afford to pay for the uniform. He was quite capable in most academic subjects, but he excelled at sports, particularly fives, and his good looks and acrobatic talents made him a popular figure. He developed a reputation for mischief, and frequently refused to do his homework. A former classmate referred to him as a &quot;scruffy little boy&quot;, while an old teacher remembered &quot;the naughty little boy who was always making a noise in the back row and would never do his homework&quot;.

He spent his evenings working backstage in Bristol theatres, and at the age of 13, was responsible for the lighting for magician David Devant at the Bristol Empire in 1917. He began hanging around backstage at the theatre at every opportunity, and volunteered for work in the summer as a messenger boy and guide at the military docks in Southampton, to escape the unhappiness of his home life. The time spent at Southampton strengthened his desire to travel; he was eager to leave Bristol and tried to sign on as a ship&#x27;s cabin boy, but he was too young.

On March 13, 1918, the 14-year-old Grant was expelled from Fairfield. Several explanations were given, including being discovered in the girls&#x27; lavatory and assisting two other classmates with theft in the nearby town of Almondsbury. Wansell claims that Grant had set out intentionally to get himself expelled from school to pursue a career in entertainment with the troupe, and he did rejoin Pender&#x27;s troupe three days after being expelled. His father had a better-paying job in Southampton, and Grant&#x27;s expulsion brought local authorities to Pender&#x27;s door with questions about why he was living in Bristol and not with his father in Southampton. His father then co-signed a three-year contract between Grant and Pender that stipulated Grant&#x27;s weekly salary, along with room and board, dancing lessons, and other training for his profession until age 18. There was also a provision in the contract for salary raises based on job performance.

== Vaudeville and performing career ==

The Pender Troupe began touring the country, and Grant&#x27;s performing pantomime developed his physical skills, broadening the range of his acting. The troupe traveled on the to conduct a tour of the United States on July 21, 1920, when he was 16, arriving a week later. Biographer Richard Schickel writes that Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford were aboard the same ship, returning from their honeymoon; Grant played shuffleboard with Fairbanks, who became an important role model for him. After arriving in New York, the group performed at the New York Hippodrome, the largest theater in the world at the time with a capacity of 5,697. They performed there for nine months, putting on 12 shows a week, and they had a successful production of &quot;Good Times&quot;.

Grant became a part of the vaudeville circuit and began touring, performing in places such as St. Louis, Missouri, Cleveland, and Milwaukee, and he decided to stay in the US with several of the other members when the rest of the troupe returned to Britain. He became fond of the Marx Brothers during this period, and Zeppo Marx was an early role model for him. In July 1922, he performed in a group called the &quot;Knockabout Comedians&quot; at the Palace Theater on Broadway. He formed another group that summer called &quot;The Walking Stanleys&quot; with several of the former members of the Pender Troupe, and he starred in a variety show named &quot;Better Times&quot; at the Hippodrome towards the end of the year. While serving as a paid escort for the opera singer Lucrezia Bori at a Park Avenue party, he met George C. Tilyou Jr., whose family owned Steeplechase Park. Learning of his acrobatic experience, Tilyou hired him to work as a stilt-walker and attract large crowds on the newly opened Coney Island Boardwalk, wearing a bright greatcoat and a sandwich board that advertised the amusement park.

Grant spent the next couple of years touring the United States with &quot;The Walking Stanleys&quot;. He visited Los Angeles for the first time in 1924, which made a lasting impression on him. The group split up and he returned to New York, where he began performing at the National Vaudeville Artists Club on West 46th Street, doing comic sketches, juggling, performing acrobatics, and as &quot;Rubber Legs&quot;, riding a unicycle. The experience was a particularly demanding one, but it gave Grant the opportunity to improve his comic technique and to develop skills that benefitted him later in Hollywood.

Grant became a leading man alongside Jean Dalrymple and decided to form the &quot;Jack Janis Company&quot;, which began touring vaudeville. He was sometimes mistaken for an Australian during this period and was nicknamed &quot;Kangaroo&quot; or &quot;Boomerang&quot;. His accent seemed to have changed as a result of moving to London with the Pender troupe and working in so many music halls in the UK and the US, eventually becoming a sort of transatlantic or mid-Atlantic accent. In 1927, he was cast as an Australian in Reggie Hammerstein&#x27;s musical &quot;Golden Dawn&quot;, for which he earned $75 a week. The show was not well received, but it lasted for 184 performances and several critics started to notice Grant as the &quot;pleasant new juvenile&quot; or &quot;competent young newcomer&quot;.

In 1928, he joined the William Morris Agency and was offered another juvenile part by Hammerstein in his play &quot;Polly&quot;, an unsuccessful production. One critic wrote that Grant &quot;has a strong masculine manner, but unfortunately fails to bring out the beauty of the score&quot;. Wansell notes that the pressure of a failing production began to make him fret, and he was eventually dropped from the run after six weeks of poor reviews. Despite the setback, Hammerstein&#x27;s rival Florenz Ziegfeld made an attempt to buy Grant&#x27;s contract, but Hammerstein sold it to the Shubert Brothers instead.

J. J. Shubert cast him in a small role as a Spaniard opposite Jeanette MacDonald in the French risqué comedy &quot;Boom-Boom&quot; at the Casino Theater on Broadway, which premiered on January 28, 1929, ten days after his 25th birthday. MacDonald later admitted that Grant was &quot;absolutely terrible in the role&quot;, but he exhibited a charm that endeared him to people and effectively saved the show from failure. The play ran for 72 shows, and Grant earned $350 a week before moving to Detroit, and then to Chicago.

To console himself, Grant bought a 1927 Packard sport phaeton. He visited his half-brother Eric in England, and he returned to New York to play the role of Max Grunewald in a Shubert production of &quot;A Wonderful Night&quot;. It premiered at the Majestic Theatre on October 31, 1929, two days after the Wall Street Crash, and lasted until February 1930 with 125 shows. The play received mixed reviews; one critic criticized his acting, likening it to a &quot;mixture of John Barrymore and cockney&quot;, while another announced that he had brought a &quot;breath of elfin Broadway&quot; to the role. Grant found it difficult forming relationships with women, remarking that he &quot;never seemed able to fully communicate with them&quot; even after many years &quot;surrounded by all sorts of attractive girls&quot; in the theater, on the road, and in New York.

In 1930, Grant toured for nine months in a production of the musical &quot;The Street Singer&quot;. It ended in early 1931, and the Shuberts invited him to spend the summer performing on the stage at The Muny in St. Louis, Missouri; he appeared in 12 different productions, putting on 87 shows. He received praise from local newspapers for these performances, gaining a reputation as a romantic leading man. Significant influences on his acting in this period were Gerald du Maurier, A. E. Matthews, Jack Buchanan, and Ronald Squire. He admitted that he was drawn to acting because of a &quot;great need to be liked and admired&quot;.

He was eventually fired by the Shuberts at the end of the summer season when he refused to accept a pay cut because of financial difficulties caused by the Depression. His unemployment was short-lived, however; impresario William B. Friedlander offered him the romantic lead in his musical &quot;Nikki&quot;, and Grant starred opposite Fay Wray as a soldier in post-World War I France. The production opened on September 29, 1931, in New York, but was stopped after just 39 performances due to the effects of the Depression.

== Film career ==
=== 1932–1936: Acting debut and early roles ===

Grant&#x27;s role in &quot;Nikki&quot; was praised by Ed Sullivan of &quot;The New York Daily News&quot;, who noted that the &quot;young lad from England&quot; had &quot;a big future in the movies&quot;. The review led to another screen test by Paramount Publix, resulting in an appearance as a sailor in &quot;Singapore Sue&quot; (1931), a ten-minute short film by Casey Robinson. Grant delivered his lines &quot;without any conviction&quot; according to McCann. Through Robinson, Grant met with Jesse L. Lasky and B. P. Schulberg, the co-founder and general manager of Paramount Pictures respectively. After a successful screen-test directed by Marion Gering, Schulberg signed a contract with the 27-year-old Grant on December 7, 1931, for five years, at a starting salary of $450 a week. Schulberg demanded that he change his name to &quot;something that sounded more all-American like Gary Cooper&quot;, and they eventually agreed on Cary Grant.

Grant set out to establish himself as what McCann calls the &quot;epitome of masculine glamour&quot;, and made Douglas Fairbanks his first role model. McCann notes that Grant&#x27;s career in Hollywood immediately took off because he exhibited a &quot;genuine charm&quot;, which made him stand out among the other good looking actors at the time, making it &quot;remarkably easy to find people who were willing to support his embryonic career&quot;. He made his feature film debut with the Frank Tuttle-directed comedy &quot;This is the Night&quot; (1932), playing an Olympic javelin thrower opposite Thelma Todd and Lili Damita. Grant disliked his role and threatened to leave Hollywood, but to his surprise a critic from &quot;Variety&quot; praised his performance, and thought that he looked like a &quot;potential femme rave&quot;.

In 1932, Grant played a wealthy playboy opposite Marlene Dietrich in &quot;Blonde Venus&quot;, directed by Josef von Sternberg. Grant&#x27;s role is described by William Rothman as projecting the &quot;distinctive kind of nonmacho masculinity that was to enable him to incarnate a man capable of being a romantic hero&quot;. Grant found that he conflicted with the director during the filming and the two often argued in German. He played a suave playboy type in a number of films: &quot;Merrily We Go to Hell&quot; opposite Fredric March and Sylvia Sidney, &quot;Devil and the Deep&quot; with Tallulah Bankhead, Gary Cooper and Charles Laughton (Cooper and Grant had no scenes together), &quot;Hot Saturday&quot; opposite Nancy Carroll and Randolph Scott, and &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; with Sidney. According to biographer Marc Eliot, while these films did not make Grant a star, they did well enough to establish him as one of Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;new crop of fast-rising actors&quot;.

In 1933, Grant gained attention for appearing in the pre-Code films &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m No Angel&quot; opposite Mae West. West would later claim that she had discovered Cary Grant. Of course Grant had already made &quot;Blonde Venus&quot; the previous year in which he was Marlene Dietrich&#x27;s leading man. Pauline Kael noted that Grant did not appear confident in his role as a Salvation Army director in &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot;, which made it all the more charming. The film was a box office hit, earning more than $2 million in the United States, and has since won much acclaim. For &quot;I&#x27;m No Angel&quot;, Grant&#x27;s salary was increased from $450 to $750 a week. The film was even more successful than &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot;, and saved Paramount from bankruptcy; Vermilye cites it as one of the best comedy films of the 1930s.

A string of financially unsuccessful films followed, including roles as a president of a company who is sued for knocking down a boy in an accident in &quot;Born to Be Bad&quot; (1934) for 20th Century Fox, a cosmetic surgeon in &quot;Kiss and Make-Up&quot; (1934), and a blinded pilot opposite Myrna Loy in &quot;Wings in the Dark&quot; (1935). Amid press reports of problems in his marriage to Cherrill, Paramount concluded that Grant was expendable.
Grant&#x27;s prospects picked up in the latter half of 1935 when he was loaned out to RKO Pictures. Producer Pandro Berman agreed to take him on in the face of failure because &quot;I&#x27;d seen him do things which were excellent, and [Katharine] Hepburn wanted him too.&quot; His first venture with RKO, playing a raffish Cockney swindler in George Cukor&#x27;s &quot;Sylvia Scarlett&quot; (1935), was the first of four collaborations with Hepburn. Though a commercial failure, his dominating performance was praised by critics, and Grant always considered the film to have been the breakthrough for his career.

When his contract with Paramount ended in 1936 with the release of &quot;Wedding Present&quot;, Grant decided not to renew it and wished to work freelance. Grant claimed to be the first freelance actor in Hollywood. His first venture as a freelance actor was &quot;The Amazing Quest of Ernest Bliss&quot; (1936), which was shot in England. The film was a box office bomb and prompted Grant to reconsider his decision. Critical and commercial success with &quot;Suzy&quot; later that year in which he played a French airman opposite Jean Harlow and Franchot Tone, led to him signing joint contracts with RKO and Columbia Pictures, enabling him to choose the stories that he felt suited his acting style. His Columbia contract was a four-film deal over two years, guaranteeing him $50,000 each for the first two and $75,000 each for the others.

=== 1937–1945: Hollywood stardom ===
In 1937, Grant began the first film under his contract with Columbia Pictures, &quot;When You&#x27;re in Love&quot;, portraying a wealthy American artist who eventually woos a famous opera singer (Grace Moore). His performance received positive feedback from critics, with Mae Tinee of &quot;The Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; describing it as the &quot;best thing he&#x27;s done in a long time&quot;. After a commercial failure in his second RKO venture &quot;The Toast of New York&quot;, Grant was loaned to Hal Roach&#x27;s studio for &quot;Topper&quot;, a screwball comedy film distributed by MGM, which became his first major comedy success. Grant played one half of a wealthy, freewheeling married couple with Constance Bennett, who wreak havoc on the world as ghosts after dying in a car accident. &quot;Topper&quot; became one of the most popular movies of the year, with a critic from &quot;Variety&quot; noting that both Grant and Bennett &quot;do their assignments with great skill&quot;. Vermilye described the film&#x27;s success as &quot;a logical springboard&quot; for Grant to star in &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; that year, his first film made with Irene Dunne and Ralph Bellamy. Though director Leo McCarey reportedly disliked Grant, who had mocked the director by enacting his mannerisms in the film, he recognized Grant&#x27;s comic talents and encouraged him to improvise his lines and draw upon his skills developed in vaudeville. The film was a critical and commercial success and made Grant a top Hollywood star, establishing a screen persona for him as a sophisticated light comedy leading man in screwball comedies.

&quot;The Awful Truth&quot; began what film critic Benjamin Schwarz of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; later called &quot;the most spectacular run ever for an actor in American pictures&quot; for Grant. In 1938, he starred opposite Katharine Hepburn in the screwball comedy &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;, featuring a leopard and frequent bickering and verbal jousting between Grant and Hepburn. He was initially uncertain how to play his character, but was told by director Howard Hawks to think of Harold Lloyd. Grant was given more leeway in the comic scenes, the editing of the film and in educating Hepburn in the art of comedy. Despite losing over $350,000 for RKO, the film earned rave reviews from critics. He again appeared with Hepburn in the romantic comedy &quot;Holiday&quot; later that year, which did not fare well commercially, to the point that Hepburn was considered to be &quot;box office poison&quot; at the time.

Despite a series of commercial failures, Grant was now more popular than ever and in high demand. According to Vermilye, in 1939, Grant played roles that were more dramatic, albeit with comical undertones. He played a British army sergeant opposite Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in the George Stevens-directed adventure film &quot;Gunga Din&quot;, set at a military station in India. Roles as a pilot opposite Jean Arthur and Rita Hayworth in Hawks&#x27; &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot;, and a wealthy landowner alongside Carole Lombard in &quot;In Name Only&quot; followed.

In 1940, Grant played a callous newspaper editor who learns that his ex-wife and former journalist, played by Rosalind Russell, is to marry insurance officer Ralph Bellamy in Hawks&#x27; comedy &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;, which was praised for its strong chemistry and &quot;great verbal athleticism&quot; between Grant and Russell. Grant reunited with Irene Dunne in &quot;My Favorite Wife&quot;, a &quot;first rate comedy&quot; according to &quot;Life&quot; magazine, which became RKO&#x27;s second biggest picture of the year, with profits of $505,000. After playing a Virginian backwoodsman in &quot;The Howards of Virginia&quot;, set during the American Revolution – which McCann considers to have been Grant&#x27;s worst film and performance – his last film of the year was in the critically lauded romantic comedy &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;, in which he played the ex-husband of Hepburn&#x27;s character. Grant felt his performance was so strong that he was bitterly disappointed not to have received an Oscar nomination, especially since both his lead co-stars, Hepburn and James Stewart, received them, with Stewart winning for Best Actor. Grant joked &quot;I&#x27;d have to blacken my teeth first before the Academy will take me seriously&quot;. Film historian David Thomson wrote that &quot;the wrong man got the Oscar&quot; for &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; and that &quot;Grant got better performances out of Hepburn than (her long-time companion) Spencer Tracy ever managed.&quot; Stewart&#x27;s winning the Oscar &quot;was considered a gold-plated apology for his being robbed of the award&quot; for the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;. Grant&#x27;s not being nominated for &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; the same year is also a &quot;sin of omission&quot; for the Oscars.
The following year Grant was considered for the Academy Award for Best Actor for &quot;Penny Serenade&quot;—his first nomination from the academy. Wansell claims that Grant found the film to be an emotional experience, because he and wife-to-be Barbara Hutton had started to discuss having their own children. Later that year he appeared in the romantic psychological thriller &quot;Suspicion&quot;, the first of Grant&#x27;s four collaborations with director Alfred Hitchcock. Grant did not warm to co-star Joan Fontaine, finding her to be temperamental and unprofessional. Film critic Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; considered that Grant was &quot;provokingly irresponsible, boyishly gay and also oddly mysterious, as the role properly demands&quot;. Hitchcock later stated that he thought the conventional happy ending of the film (with the wife discovering her husband is innocent rather than his being guilty and she letting him kill her with a glass of poisoned milk) &quot;a complete mistake because of making that story with Cary Grant. Unless you have a cynical ending it makes the story too simple&quot;. Geoff Andrew of &quot;Time Out&quot; believes &quot;Suspicion&quot; served as &quot;a supreme example of Grant&#x27;s ability to be simultaneously charming and sinister&quot;.

In 1942, Grant participated in a three-week tour of the United States as part of a group to help the war effort and was photographed visiting wounded marines in hospital. He appeared in several routines of his own during these shows and often played the straight-man opposite Bert Lahr. In May 1942, when he was 38, the ten-minute propaganda short &quot;Road to Victory&quot; was released, in which he appeared alongside Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Charles Ruggles. On film, Grant played Leopold Dilg, a convict on the run in &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot; (1942), who escapes after being wrongly convicted of arson and murder. He hides in a house with characters played by Jean Arthur and Ronald Colman, and gradually plots to secure his freedom. Crowther praised the script, and noted that Grant played Dilg with a &quot;casualness which is slightly disturbing&quot;. After a role as a foreign correspondent opposite Ginger Rogers and Walter Slezak in the off-beat comedy &quot;Once Upon a Honeymoon&quot;, in which he was praised for his scenes with Rogers, he appeared in &quot;Mr. Lucky&quot; the following year, playing a gambler in a casino aboard a ship. The commercially successful submarine war film &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot; (1943) was shot in just six weeks in September and October, which left him exhausted; the reviewer from &quot;Newsweek&quot; thought it was one of the finest performances of his career.

In 1944, Grant starred alongside Priscilla Lane, Raymond Massey and Peter Lorre, in Frank Capra&#x27;s dark comedy &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;, playing the manic Mortimer Brewster, who belongs to a bizarre family that includes two murderous aunts and an uncle claiming to be President Teddy Roosevelt. Grant took up the role after it was originally offered to Bob Hope, who turned it down owing to schedule conflicts. Grant found the macabre subject matter of the film difficult to contend with and believed that it was the worst performance of his career. That year he received his second Oscar nomination for a role, opposite Ethel Barrymore and Barry Fitzgerald in the Clifford Odets-directed film &quot;None but the Lonely Heart&quot;, set in London during the Depression. Late in the year he featured in the CBS Radio series &quot;Suspense&quot;, playing a tormented character who hysterically discovers that his amnesia has affected the masculine order in society in &quot;The Black Curtain&quot;.

=== 1946–1953: Post-War success and slump ===

After making a brief cameo appearance opposite Claudette Colbert in &quot;Without Reservations&quot; (1946), Grant portrayed Cole Porter in the musical &quot;Night and Day&quot; (1946). The production proved to be problematic, with scenes often requiring multiple takes, frustrating the cast and crew. Grant next appeared with Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains in the Hitchcock-directed film &quot;Notorious&quot; (1946), playing a government agent who recruits the American daughter of a convicted Nazi spy (Bergman) to infiltrate a Nazi organization in Brazil after World War II. During the course of the film Grant and Bergman&#x27;s characters fall in love and share one of the longest kisses in film history at around two and a half minutes. Wansell notes how Grant&#x27;s performance &quot;underlined how far his unique qualities as a screen actor had matured in the years since &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;&quot;.

In 1947, Grant played an artist who becomes involved in a court case when charged with assault in the comedy &quot;The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer&quot; (released in the U.K. as &quot;Bachelor Knight&quot;), opposite Myrna Loy and Shirley Temple. The film was praised by the critics, who admired the picture&#x27;s slapstick qualities and chemistry between Grant and Loy; it became one of the biggest-selling films at the box office that year. Later that year he starred opposite David Niven and Loretta Young in the comedy &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot;, playing an angel who is sent down from heaven to straighten out the relationship between the bishop (Niven) and his wife (Loretta Young). The film was a major commercial and critical success, and was nominated for five Academy Awards. &quot;Life&quot; magazine called it &quot;intelligently written and competently acted&quot;.
The following year, Grant played neurotic Jim Blandings, the title-sake in the comedy &quot;Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House&quot;, again with Loy. Though the film lost money for RKO, Philip T. Hartung of &quot;Commonweal&quot; thought that Grant&#x27;s role as the &quot;frustrated advertising man&quot; was one of his best screen portrayals. In &quot;Every Girl Should Be Married&quot;, an &quot;airy comedy&quot;, he appeared with Betsy Drake and Franchot Tone, playing a bachelor who is trapped into marriage by Drake&#x27;s conniving character. He finished the year as the fourth most popular film star at the box office. In 1949, Grant starred alongside Ann Sheridan in the comedy &quot;I Was a Male War Bride&quot; in which he appeared in scenes dressed as a woman, wearing a skirt and a wig. During the filming he was taken ill with infectious hepatitis and lost weight, affecting the way he looked in the picture. The film, based on the autobiography of Belgian resistance fighter Roger Charlier, proved to be successful, becoming the highest-grossing film for 20th Century Fox that year with over $4.5 million in takings and being likened to Hawks&#x27;s screwball comedies of the late 1930s. By this point he was one of the highest paid Hollywood stars, commanding $300,000 per picture.

The early 1950s marked the beginning of a slump in Grant&#x27;s career. His roles as a top brain surgeon who is caught in the middle of a bitter revolution in a Latin American country in &quot;Crisis&quot;, and as a medical-school professor and orchestra conductor opposite Jeanne Crain in &quot;People Will Talk&quot; were poorly received. Grant had become tired of being Cary Grant after twenty years, being successful, wealthy and popular, and remarked: &quot;To play yourself, your &quot;true&quot; self, is the hardest thing in the world&quot;. In 1952, Grant starred in the comedy &quot;Room for One More&quot;, playing an engineer husband who with his wife (Betsy Drake) adopt two children from an orphanage. He reunited with Howard Hawks to film the off-beat comedy &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, co-starring Ginger Rogers and Marilyn Monroe. Though the critic from &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; wrote gushingly that Grant had given a career&#x27;s best with an &quot;extraordinary and agile performance&quot;, which was matched by Rogers, it received a mixed reception overall. Grant had hoped that starring opposite Deborah Kerr in the romantic comedy &quot;Dream Wife&quot; would salvage his career, but it was a critical and financial failure upon release in July 1953, when Grant was 49. Though he was offered the leading part in &quot;A Star is Born&quot;, Grant decided against playing that character. He believed that his film career was over, and briefly left the industry.

=== 1955–1966: Film resurgence and final roles ===
In 1955, Grant agreed to star opposite Grace Kelly in &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;, playing a retired jewel thief named John Robie, nicknamed &quot;The Cat&quot;, living in the French Riviera. Grant and Kelly worked well together during the production, which was one of the most enjoyable experiences of Grant&#x27;s career. He found Hitchcock and Kelly to be very professional, and later stated that Kelly was &quot;possibly the finest actress I&#x27;ve ever worked with&quot;. Grant was one of the first actors to go independent by not renewing his studio contract, effectively leaving the studio system, which almost completely controlled all aspects of an actor&#x27;s life. He decided which films he was going to appear in, often had personal choice of directors and co-stars, and at times negotiated a share of the gross revenue, something uncommon at the time. Grant received more than $700,000 for his 10% of the gross of the successful &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;, while Hitchcock received less than $50,000 for directing and producing it. Though critical reception to the overall film was mixed, Grant received high praise for his performance, with critics commenting on his suave, handsome appearance in the film.

In 1957, Grant starred opposite Deborah Kerr in the romance &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot;, playing an international playboy who becomes the object of her affections. Schickel sees the film as one of the definitive romantic pictures of the period, but remarks that Grant was not entirely successful in trying to supersede the film&#x27;s &quot;gushing sentimentality&quot;. That year, Grant also appeared opposite Sophia Loren in &quot;The Pride and the Passion&quot;. He had expressed an interest in playing William Holden&#x27;s character in &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; at the time, but found that it was not possible because of his commitment to &quot;The Pride and the Passion&quot;. The film was shot on location in Spain and was problematic, with co-star Frank Sinatra irritating his colleagues and leaving the production after just a few weeks. Although Grant had an affair with Loren during filming, Grant&#x27;s attempts to woo Loren to marry him during the production proved fruitless, which led to him expressing anger when Paramount cast her opposite him in &quot;Houseboat&quot; (1958) as part of her contract. The sexual tension between the two was so great during the making of &quot;Houseboat&quot; that the producers found it almost impossible to make. Later in 1958, Grant starred opposite Bergman in the romantic comedy &quot;Indiscreet&quot;, playing a successful financier who has an affair with a famous actress (Bergman) while pretending to be a married man. During the filming he formed a closer friendship and gained new respect for her as an actress. Schickel stated that he thought the film was possibly the finest romantic comedy film of the era, and that Grant himself had professed that it was one of his personal favorites. Grant received his first of five Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy nominations for his performance and finished the year as the most popular film star at the box office.
In 1959, Grant starred in the Hitchcock-directed film &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, playing an advertising executive who becomes embroiled in a case of mistaken identity. Like &quot;Indiscreet&quot;, it was warmly received by the critics and was a major commercial success,
and is now often listed as one of the greatest films of all time. Weiler, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised Grant&#x27;s performance, remarking that the actor &quot;was never more at home than in this role of the advertising-man-on-the-lam&quot; and handled the role &quot;with professional aplomb and grace&quot;. Grant wore one of his most well-known suits in the film, which became very popular, a fourteen-gauge, mid-gray, subtly plaid, worsted wool that was custom-made on Savile Row. Grant finished the year playing a U.S. Navy submarine skipper opposite Tony Curtis in the comedy &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot;. The reviewer from &quot;Daily Variety&quot; saw Grant&#x27;s comic portrayal as a classic example of how to attract the laughter of the audience without lines, remarking that &quot;In this film, most of the gags play off him. It is his reaction, blank, startled, etc., always underplayed, that creates or releases the humor&quot;. The film was major box office success, and in 1973, Deschner ranked the film as the highest earning film of Grant&#x27;s career at the US box office, with takings of $9.5 million.

In 1960, Grant appeared opposite Deborah Kerr, Robert Mitchum, and Jean Simmons in &quot;The Grass Is Greener&quot;, which was shot in England at Osterley Park and Shepperton Studios. McCann notes that Grant took great relish in &quot;mocking his aristocratic character&#x27;s over-refined tastes and mannerisms&quot;, though the film was panned and was seen as his worst since &quot;Dream Wife&quot;. In 1962, Grant starred in the romantic comedy &quot;That Touch of Mink&quot;, playing suave, wealthy businessman Philip Shayne romantically involved with an office worker, played by Doris Day. He invites her to his apartment in Bermuda, but her guilty conscience begins to take hold. The picture was praised by critics, and it received three Academy Award nominations and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Comedy Picture, in addition to landing Grant another Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor. Deschner ranked the film as the second highest grossing of Grant&#x27;s career.

Producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman originally sought Grant for the role of James Bond in &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962) but discarded the idea as Grant would be committed to only one feature film; therefore, the producers decided to go after someone who could be part of a franchise after James Mason would only agree to commit to three films. In 1963, Grant appeared in his last typically suave, romantic role opposite Audrey Hepburn in &quot;Charade&quot;. Grant found the experience of working with Hepburn &quot;wonderful&quot; and believed that their close relationship was clear on camera, though according to Hepburn, he was particularly worried during the filming that he would be criticized for being far too old for her and seen as a &quot;cradle snatcher&quot;. Author Chris Barsanti writes: &quot;It&#x27;s the film&#x27;s canny flirtatiousness that makes it such ingenious entertainment. Grant and Hepburn play off each other like the pros that they are&quot;. The film, well received by the critics, is often called &quot;the best Hitchcock film Hitchcock never made&quot;.

In 1964, Grant changed from his typically suave, distinguished screen persona to play a grizzled beachcomber who is coerced into serving as a coastwatcher on an uninhabited island in the World War II romantic comedy &quot;Father Goose&quot;. The film was a major commercial success, and upon its release at Radio City at Christmas 1964 it took over $210,000 at the box-office in the first week, breaking the record set by &quot;Charade&quot; the previous year. Grant&#x27;s final film, &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot; (1966), a comedy co-starring Jim Hutton and Samantha Eggar, was shot on location in Tokyo, and is set amid the backdrop of the housing shortage of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. &quot;Newsweek&quot; concluded: &quot;Though Grant&#x27;s personal presence is indispensable, the character he plays is almost wholly superfluous. Perhaps the inference to be taken is that a man in his 50s or 60s has no place in romantic comedy except as a catalyst. If so, the chemistry is wrong for everyone&quot;. Hitchcock had asked Grant to star in &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; that year, only to learn that he had decided to retire.

== Later years ==

In 1966, when his daughter Jennifer Grant was born, Grant retired from the screen so he could focus on bringing her up and to provide a sense of permanence and stability in her life. He had become increasingly disillusioned with cinema in the 1960s, rarely finding a script of which he approved. He remarked: &quot;I could have gone on acting and playing a grandfather or a bum, but I discovered more important things in life&quot;. He knew after he had made &quot;Charade&quot; that the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Hollywood was over. Grant expressed little interest in making a career comeback, and would respond to the suggestion with &quot;fat chance&quot;. He did, however, briefly appear in the audience for Elvis Presley&#x27;s 1970 Las Vegas concert documentary &quot;&quot;. In the 1970s, he was given the negatives from a number of his films, and he sold them to television for a sum of over $2 million dollars in 1975 .

Morecambe and Stirling argue that Grant&#x27;s absence from film after 1966 was not because he had &quot;irrevocably turned his back on the film industry,&quot; but because he was &quot;caught between a decision made and the temptation to eat a bit of humble pie and re-announce himself to the cinema-going public&quot;. In the 1970s, MGM was keen on remaking &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; (1932) and hoped to lure Grant out of retirement. Hitchcock had long wanted to make a film based on the idea of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, with Grant in the lead role. Grant stated that Warren Beatty had made a big effort to get him to play the role of Mr. Jordan in &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978), which eventually went to James Mason. Morecambe and Stirling claim that Grant had also expressed an interest in appearing in &quot;A Touch of Class&quot; (1973), &quot;The Verdict&quot; (1982), and a film adaptation of William Goldman&#x27;s 1983 book about screenwriting, &quot;Adventures in the Screen Trade&quot;.

In the late 1970s and early &#x27;80s, Grant became troubled by the deaths of many close friends, including Howard Hughes in 1976, Howard Hawks in 1977, Lord Mountbatten and Barbara Hutton in 1979, Alfred Hitchcock in 1980, Grace Kelly and Ingrid Bergman in 1982, and David Niven in 1983. At the funeral of Mountbatten, he was quoted as remarking to a friend: &quot;I&#x27;m absolutely pooped, and I&#x27;m so goddamned old. ...I&#x27;m going to quit all next year. I&#x27;m going to lie in bed... I shall just close all doors, turn off the telephone, and enjoy my life&quot;. Grace Kelly&#x27;s death was the hardest on him, as it was unexpected and the two had remained close friends after filming &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;. Grant visited Monaco three or four times each year during his retirement, and showed his support for Kelly by joining the board of the Princess Grace Foundation.

In 1980, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art put on a two-month retrospective of more than 40 of Grant&#x27;s films. In 1982, he was honored with the &quot;Man of the Year&quot; award by the New York Friars Club at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. He turned 80 on January 18, 1984, and Peter Bogdanovich noticed that a &quot;serenity&quot; had come over him. Grant was in good health until he had a mild stroke in October that year. In the last few years of his life, he undertook tours of the United States in the one-man show &quot;A Conversation with Cary Grant&quot;, in which he would show clips from his films and answer audience questions. He made some 36 public appearances in his last four years, from New Jersey to Texas, and his audiences ranged from elderly film buffs to enthusiastic college students discovering his films for the first time. Grant admitted that the appearances were &quot;ego-fodder&quot;, remarking that &quot;I know who I am inside and outside, but it&#x27;s nice to have the outside, at least, substantiated&quot;.

== Business interests ==

Stirling refers to Grant as &quot;one of the shrewdest businessmen ever to operate in Hollywood&quot;. His long-term friendship with Howard Hughes from the 1930s onward saw him invited into the most glamorous circles in Hollywood and their lavish parties. Biographers Morecambe and Stirling state that Hughes played a major role in the development of Grant&#x27;s business interests so that by 1939, he was &quot;already an astute operator with various commercial interests&quot;. Scott also played a role, encouraging Grant to invest his money in shares, making him a wealthy man by the end of the 1930s. In the 1940s, Grant and Barbara Hutton invested heavily in real estate development in Acapulco at a time when it was little more than a fishing village, and teamed up with Richard Widmark, Roy Rogers, and Red Skelton to buy a hotel there. Behind his business interests was a particularly intelligent mind, to the point that his friend David Niven once said: &quot;Before computers went into general release, Cary had one in his brain&quot;. Film critic David Thomson believes that Grant&#x27;s intelligence came across on screen, and stated that &quot;no one else looked so good and so intelligent at the same time&quot;.

After Grant retired from the screen, he became more active in business. He accepted a position on the board of directors at Fabergé. This position was not honorary, as some had assumed; Grant regularly attended meetings and traveled internationally to support them. His pay was modest in comparison to the millions of his film career, a salary of a reported $15,000 a year. Such was Grant&#x27;s influence on the company that George Barrie once claimed that Grant had played a role in the growth of the firm to annual revenues of about $50 million in 1968, a growth of nearly 80% since the inaugural year in 1964. The position also permitted the use of a private plane, which Grant could use to fly to see his daughter wherever her mother, Dyan Cannon, was working.

In 1975, Grant was an appointed director of MGM. In 1980, he sat on the board of MGM Films and MGM Grand Hotels following the division of the parent company. He played an active role in the promotion of MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas when opened in 1973, and he continued to promote the city throughout the 1970s. When Allan Warren met Grant for a photo shoot that year he noticed how tired Grant looked, and his &quot;slightly melancholic air&quot;. Grant later joined the boards of Hollywood Park, the Academy of Magical Arts (The Magic Castle, Hollywood, California), and Western Airlines (acquired by Delta Air Lines in 1987).

== Personal life ==

Grant became a naturalized United States citizen on June 26, 1942, aged 38, at which time he also legally changed his name to Cary Grant. At the time of his naturalization, he listed his middle name as Alexander rather than Alec.

One of the wealthiest stars in Hollywood, Grant owned houses in Beverly Hills, Malibu, and Palm Springs. He was immaculate in his personal grooming, and Edith Head, the renowned Hollywood costume designer, appreciated his &quot;meticulous&quot; attention to detail and considered him to have had the greatest fashion sense of any actor she had worked with. McCann attributed his &quot;almost obsessive maintenance&quot; with tanning, which deepened the older he got, to Douglas Fairbanks, who also had a major influence on his refined sense of dress. McCann notes that because Grant came from a working-class background and was not well educated, he made a particular effort over the course of his career to mix with high society and absorb their knowledge, manners, and etiquette. His image was meticulously crafted from the early days in Hollywood, where he would frequently sunbathe; he avoided being photographed smoking despite smoking two packs a day at the time. Grant quit smoking in the early 1950s through hypnotherapy. He remained health-conscious, staying very trim and athletic even into his late career, though he claimed that he &quot;never crook[ed] a finger to keep fit&quot;, saying that he did &quot;everything in moderation. Except making love.&quot;

Grant&#x27;s daughter Jennifer said that her father made hundreds of friends from all walks of life, and that their house was frequently visited by the likes of Frank and Barbara Sinatra, Quincy Jones, Gregory Peck and his wife Veronique, Johnny Carson and his wife, Kirk Kerkorian, and Merv Griffin. She said that Grant and Sinatra were the closest of friends, that the two men had a similar radiance and &quot;indefinable incandescence of charm&quot;, and that they were eternally &quot;high on life&quot;. While raising Jennifer, Grant archived artifacts of her childhood and adolescence in a bank-quality, room-sized vault he had installed in the house. Jennifer attributed this meticulous collection to the fact that artifacts of his own childhood had been destroyed during the Luftwaffe&#x27;s bombing of Bristol in World War II (an event that also claimed the lives of his uncle, aunt, cousin, and his cousin&#x27;s husband and grandson), and he may have wanted to prevent her from experiencing a similar loss.
Grant lived with costume designer Orry-Kelly from 1925 to 1931 in the West Village, New York, until both moved to Hollywood. They met when Grant was a struggling performer who had just been evicted from a boarding house for nonpayment; they had a volatile, on-and-off relationship over three decades until Orry-Kelly died in 1964, when Grant became one of his pallbearers. While Kelly stops short of claiming that Grant was his boyfriend in his memoir, director Gillian Armstrong&#x27;s documentary on Kelly&#x27;s memoir states so outright.

Grant lived with actor Randolph Scott off and on for 12 years. The two met early in Grant&#x27;s career, in 1932, at the Paramount studio when Scott was filming &quot;Sky Bride&quot; while Grant was shooting &quot;Sinners in the Sun;&quot; they moved in together soon afterwards. Whether the relationship was romantic is a matter of biographical dispute. Certainly, the association was critical to shaping Grant&#x27;s star persona. Scott, who hailed from wealth, was polished and relaxed; Grant, who&#x27;d been gauche and unsophisticated, would adopt these traits and make them his trademark.

Richard Blackwell, then an actor at RKO, Jerome Zerbe, a photographer who shot a series of publicity photographs of the couple in their home, and Scotty Bowers, a Hollywood pimp, all claimed to have slept with the pair. Blackwell wrote in his autobiography that Grant and Scott &quot;were deeply, madly in love, their devotion was complete&quot;. Biographer and friend of Grant&#x27;s, Bill Royce, claimed that in old age Grant confessed to him that he and Scott had been bisexual, and that their relationship was the first time he&#x27;d ever been in love, characterising the memory as: &quot;Have you ever heard of gravity collapse?&quot; However, he allegedly also told Royce that while Scott had loved him &quot;on some profound level&quot;, Scott had not desired him physically to the same degree, but that they had explored the imbalance of their attraction. Since Grant&#x27;s death, journalists such as David Canfield writing for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; have revisited the rumours and speculation.

Grant&#x27;s daughter, Jennifer, has denied her father was bisexual. When Chevy Chase joked on television in 1980 that Grant was a &quot;homo. What a gal!&quot;, Grant sued him for slander, and Chase was forced to retract his words. Grant became a fan of comedians Morecambe and Wise in the 1960s, and remained friends with Eric Morecambe until his death in 1984.

Grant began experimenting with LSD in the late 1950s, before it became more widely popular. His wife at the time, Betsy Drake, displayed a keen interest in psychotherapy, and through her Grant developed a considerable knowledge of the field of psychoanalysis. Radiologist Mortimer Hartman began treating him with LSD in the late 1950s, with Grant optimistic that it could make him feel better about himself and rid him of the inner turmoil from his childhood and failed relationships. He had an estimated 100 sessions over several years. For a long time, Grant viewed the drug positively, saying that it was the solution after many years of &quot;searching for his peace of mind&quot;, and that for the first time in his life he was &quot;truly, deeply and honestly happy&quot;. Dyan Cannon claimed during a court hearing that he was an &quot;apostle of LSD&quot;, and that he was still taking the drug in 1967 as part of a remedy to save their relationship. Grant later remarked that &quot;taking LSD was an utterly foolish thing to do but I was a self-opinionated boor, hiding all kinds of layers and defences, hypocrisy and vanity. I had to get rid of them and wipe the slate clean.&quot;

=== Marriages ===

Grant was married five times. He wed Virginia Cherrill on February 9, 1934, at the Caxton Hall register office in London. She divorced him on March 26, 1935, following charges that he had hit her. They were involved in a bitter divorce case which was widely reported in the press, with Cherrill demanding $1,000 a week from him in benefits from his Paramount earnings. Grant then dated actress Phyllis Brooks from 1937. They considered marriage and vacationed together in Europe in mid-1939, visiting the Roman villa of Dorothy Taylor Dentice di Frasso in Italy, but the relationship ended later that year.

He married Barbara Hutton in 1942, one of the wealthiest women in the world, following a $50 million inheritance from her grandfather Frank Winfield Woolworth. They were derisively nicknamed &quot;Cash and Cary&quot;, although Grant refused any financial settlement in a prenuptial agreement to avoid the accusation that he married for money. Toward the end of their marriage they lived in a white mansion at 10615 Bellagio Road in Bel Air. They divorced in 1945, although they remained the &quot;fondest of friends&quot;. He dated Betty Hensel for a period, then married Betsy Drake, the co-star of two of his films, on December 25, 1949. In 1957 Grant had an affair with Sophia Loren. Drake and Grant separated in 1958, divorcing on August 14,1962. It was his longest marriage.

Grant married Dyan Cannon on July 22, 1965, at the Desert Inn in Las Vegas, and their daughter Jennifer, his only child, was born on February 26, 1966; he frequently called her his &quot;best production&quot;. He said of fatherhood:

My life changed the day Jennifer was born. I&#x27;ve come to think that the reason we&#x27;re put on this earth is to procreate. To leave something behind. Not films, because you know that I don&#x27;t think my films will last very long once I&#x27;m gone. But another human being. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s important.

Grant and Cannon separated in August 1967.

On March 12, 1968, Grant was involved in a car accident in Queens, New York, en route to JFK Airport, when a truck hit the side of his limousine. He was hospitalized for 17 days with three broken ribs and bruising. A female companion, Baroness Gratia von Furstenberg, was also injured in the accident. Grant and Cannon divorced nine days later.

Grant had a brief affair with actress Cynthia Bouron in the late 1960s. He had been at odds with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1958, but received an Academy Honorary Award in 1970. He announced that he would attend the awards ceremony to accept it, ending his 12-year boycott of the ceremony. Two days after his announcement, Bouron filed a paternity suit against him and publicly stated that he was the father of her seven-week-old daughter, and she named him as the father on the child&#x27;s birth certificate. Grant challenged her to a blood test and Bouron failed to provide one, and the court ordered her to remove his name from the certificate. Between 1973 and 1977, he dated British photojournalist Maureen Donaldson, followed by the much younger Victoria Morgan.

On April 11, 1981, Grant married Barbara Harris, a British hotel public relations agent 46 years his junior. They met in 1976 at the Royal Lancaster Hotel in London, where Harris was working at the time and Grant was attending a Fabergé conference. They became friends, but it was not until 1979 that she moved to live with him in California. Grant&#x27;s friends felt that she had a positive impact on him, and Prince Rainier of Monaco remarked that Grant had &quot;never been happier&quot; than he was in his last years with her.

=== Politics ===
Biographer Nancy Nelson noted that Grant did not openly align himself with political causes but occasionally commented on current events. Grant spoke out against the blacklisting of his friend Charlie Chaplin during the period of McCarthyism, arguing that Chaplin was not a communist and that his status as an entertainer was more important than his political beliefs. In 1950, he told a reporter that he would like to see a female president of the United States but asserted a reluctance to comment on political affairs, believing it was not the place of actors to do so. Grant supported Thomas Dewey in the 1944 United States presidential election, appearing at a rally at the Los Angeles Coliseum after the New York governor won the Republican nomination.

In 1963 Grant visited Washington and with Attorney General Robert Kennedy went to a schoolyard, then a nearby junkyard as the two men considered what turning it into a playground might do for the children of Washington, DC,
On December 10, 1967, Grant attended the Democratic National Committee Fundraising Dinner at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.

In 1976, Grant made a public appearance at the Republican Party National Convention in Kansas City during which he gave a speech in support of Gerald Ford&#x27;s reelection and for female equality before introducing Betty Ford onto the stage. A 1977 interview with Grant in &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted his political beliefs to be conservative but observed that Grant did not actively campaign for candidates.

=== Death ===

Grant was at the Adler Theater in Davenport, Iowa, on the afternoon of Saturday, November 29, 1986, preparing for his performance in &quot;A Conversation with Cary Grant&quot; when he was taken ill; he had been feeling unwell as he arrived at the theater. Basil Williams photographed him there and thought that he still looked his usual suave self, but he noticed that he seemed very tired and that he stumbled once in the auditorium. Williams recalls that Grant rehearsed for half an hour before &quot;something seemed wrong&quot; all of a sudden, and he disappeared backstage. Grant was taken back to the Blackhawk Hotel where he and his wife had checked in, and a doctor was called and discovered that Grant was having a massive stroke, with a blood pressure reading of 210 over 130. Grant refused to be taken to the hospital. The doctor recalled: &quot;The stroke was getting worse. In only fifteen minutes he deteriorated rapidly. It was terrible watching him die and not being able to help. But he wouldn&#x27;t let us.&quot; By 8:45 p.m., Grant had slipped into a coma and was taken to St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in Davenport, Iowa. He spent 45 minutes in the emergency room before being transferred to intensive care. He died at 11:22 pm, aged 82.

An editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated: &quot;Cary Grant was not supposed to die. ... Cary Grant was supposed to stick around, our perpetual touchstone of charm and elegance and romance and youth.&quot; His body was taken back to California, where it was cremated and his ashes scattered in the Pacific Ocean. No funeral was conducted for him following his request, which Roderick Mann remarked was appropriate for &quot;the private man who didn&#x27;t want the nonsense of a funeral&quot;. His estate was worth in the region of 60 to 80 million dollars; the bulk of it went to Barbara Harris and Jennifer.

== Screen persona ==

McCann wrote that one of the reasons why Grant&#x27;s film career was so successful is that he was not conscious of how handsome he was on screen, acting in a fashion that was most unexpected and unusual from a Hollywood star of that period. George Cukor once stated: &quot;You see, he didn&#x27;t depend on his looks. He wasn&#x27;t a narcissist, he acted as though he were just an ordinary young man. And that made it all the more appealing, that a handsome young man was funny; that was especially unexpected and good because we think, &#x27;Well, if he&#x27;s a Beau Brummel, he can&#x27;t be either funny or intelligent&#x27;, but he proved otherwise&quot;. Jennifer Grant acknowledged that her father neither relied on his looks nor was a character actor, and said that he was just the opposite of that, playing the &quot;basic man&quot;.

Grant&#x27;s appeal was unusually broad among both men and women. Pauline Kael remarked that men wanted to be him and women dreamed of dating him. She noticed that Grant treated his female co-stars differently than many of the leading men at the time, regarding them as subjects with multiple qualities rather than &quot;treating them as sex objects&quot;. Leslie Caron said that he was the most talented leading man she worked with. David Shipman writes that &quot;more than most stars, he belonged to the public&quot;. A number of critics have argued that Grant had the rare star ability to turn a mediocre picture into a good one. Philip T. Hartung of &quot;The Commonweal&quot; stated in his review for &quot;Mr. Lucky&quot; (1943) that, if it &quot;weren&#x27;t for Cary Grant&#x27;s persuasive personality, the whole thing would melt away to nothing at all&quot;. Political theorist C. L. R. James saw Grant as a &quot;new and very important symbol&quot;, a new type of Englishman who differed from Leslie Howard and Ronald Colman, who represented the &quot;freedom, natural grace, simplicity, and directness which characterise such different American types as Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan&quot;, which ultimately symbolized the growing relationship between Britain and America.

McCann notes that Grant typically played &quot;wealthy privileged characters who never seemed to have any need to work in order to maintain their glamorous and hedonistic lifestyle&quot;. Martin Stirling thought that Grant had an acting range that was &quot;greater than any of his contemporaries&quot;, but felt that a number of critics underrated him as an actor. He believes that Grant was always at his &quot;physical and verbal best in situations that bordered on farce&quot;. Charles Champlin identifies a paradox in Grant&#x27;s screen persona, in his unusual ability to &quot;mix polish and pratfalls in successive scenes&quot;. He remarks that Grant was &quot;refreshingly able to play the near-fool, the fey idiot, without compromising his masculinity or surrendering to camp for its own sake&quot;. Wansell further notes that Grant could, &quot;with the arch of an eyebrow or the merest hint of a smile, question his own image&quot;. Stanley Donen stated that his real &quot;magic&quot; came from his attention to minute details and always seeming real, which came from &quot;enormous amounts of work&quot; rather than being God-given. Grant remarked of his career: &quot;I guess to a certain extent I did eventually become the characters I was playing. I played at being someone I wanted to be until I became that person, or he became me&quot;. He professed that the real Cary Grant was more like his scruffy, unshaven fisherman in &quot;Father Goose&quot; than the &quot;well-tailored charmer&quot; of &quot;Charade&quot;.

Grant often poked fun at himself with statements such as, &quot;Everyone wants to be Cary Grant—even I want to be Cary Grant&quot;, and in ad-lib lines such as in &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (1940): &quot;Listen, the last man who said that to me was Archie Leach, just a week before he cut his throat.&quot; In &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; (1944), a gravestone is seen bearing the name Archie Leach. Alfred Hitchcock thought that Grant was very effective in darker roles, with a mysterious, dangerous quality, remarking that &quot;there is a frightening side to Cary that no one can quite put their finger on&quot;. Wansell notes that this darker, mysterious side extended to his personal life, which he took great lengths to cover up to retain his debonair image. In a profile, Tom Wolfe wrote that &quot;Cary Grant plays a wonderful Cary Grant.&quot; Upon being recognized by a fan, Wolfe writes that Grant &quot;cocks his head and gives her the Cary Grant mock-quizzical look—just like he does in the movies—the look that says, &#x27;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening, but we&#x27;re not going to take it very seriously, are we? Or are we?&#x27;&quot;

== Legacy ==

Biographers Morecambe and Stirling believe that Cary Grant was the &quot;greatest leading man Hollywood had ever known&quot;. Schickel stated that there are &quot;very few stars who achieve the magnitude of Cary Grant, art of a very high and subtle order&quot; and thought that he was the &quot;best star actor there ever was in the movies&quot;. David Thomson and directors Stanley Donen and Howard Hawks concurred that Grant was the greatest and most important actor in the history of the cinema. He was a favorite of Hitchcock&#x27;s, who admired him and called him &quot;the only actor I ever loved in my whole life&quot;. He remained one of Hollywood&#x27;s top box-office attractions for almost 30 years. Pauline Kael stated that the world still thinks of him affectionately because he &quot;embodies what seems a happier time−a time when we had a simpler relationship to a performer&quot;.
Grant was nominated for Academy Awards for &quot;Penny Serenade&quot; (1941) and &quot;None But the Lonely Heart&quot; (1944), but he never won a competitive Oscar. He did, however, receive a special Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1970. The inscription on his statuette read &quot;To Cary Grant, for his unique mastery of the art of screen acting with respect and affection of his colleagues&quot;. Presenting the award to Grant, Frank Sinatra announced: &quot;No one has brought more pleasure to more people for so many years than Cary has, and nobody has done so many things so well&quot;.

Grant was awarded a special plaque at the Straw Hat Awards in New York in May 1975, which recognized him as a &quot;star and superstar in entertainment&quot;. In July 1976, Betty Ford invited him to attend the Bicentennial dinner for Queen Elizabeth II at the White House and to give a speech introducing her at the Republican National Convention in Kansas City the following month. He was invited to a royal charity gala in 1978 at the London Palladium. In 1979, he hosted the American Film Institute&#x27;s tribute to Alfred Hitchcock, and presented Laurence Olivier with his honorary Oscar.

In 1981, Grant was accorded the Kennedy Center Honors. In 1984, a theater on the MGM lot was renamed the &quot;Cary Grant Theatre&quot;. In 1995, more than 100 leading film directors were asked to reveal their favorite actor of all time in a &quot;Time Out&quot; poll, and Grant came second only to Marlon Brando. In December 2001, a statue of Grant by Graham Ibbeson was unveiled in Millennium Square, a regenerated area next to Bristol Harbour, Bristol, the city where he was born. In November 2005, Grant again came first in &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Movie Stars of All Time&quot;. The biennial Cary Comes Home Festival was established in 2014 in his hometown Bristol. McCann declared that Grant was &quot;quite simply, the funniest actor cinema has ever produced&quot;.

There is a street named after Grant in San Antonio, Texas.

In November 2024, a Historic England national blue plaque was unveiled on his childhood home at 50 Berkeley Road, Bishopston, Bristol, where he lived from about age four to six, by Heritage Minister Sir Chris Bryant.

===Portrayals===
Grant was portrayed by John Gavin in the 1980 made-for-television biographical film &quot;Sophia Loren: Her Own Story&quot;, and in the similar 1987 TV serialisation &quot;Poor Little Rich Girl: The Barbara Hutton Story&quot;, James Read played Grant as Barbara Hutton&#x27;s third husband.

The British miniseries &quot;Archie&quot;, covering Grant&#x27;s life, was broadcast from November 2023 on ITV. Grant is portrayed by Dainton Anderson, Oaklee Pendergast, Calam Lynch and Jason Isaacs at successive stages of his life.

== Filmography and stage work ==
From 1932 to 1966, Grant starred in over seventy films. In 1999, the American Film Institute named him the second-greatest male star of Golden Age Hollywood cinema (after Humphrey Bogart). He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for &quot;Penny Serenade&quot; (1941) and &quot;None but the Lonely Heart&quot; (1944).

Widely recognized for comedic and dramatic roles, among his best-known films are:
* &quot;Blonde Venus&quot; (1932) with Marlene Dietrich

<doc id="38972" wikidata="Q202509" url="?curid=38972" title="Chinatown">
<text>Chinatown () is the catch-all name for an ethnic enclave of Chinese people located outside Greater China, most often in an urban setting. Areas known as &quot;Chinatown&quot; exist throughout the world, including Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania, and the Americas.

The development of most Chinatowns typically resulted from human migration to an area without any or with few Chinese residents. Binondo in Manila, established in 1594, is recognized as the world&#x27;s oldest Chinatown. Notable early examples outside Asia include San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown in the United States and Melbourne&#x27;s Chinatown in Australia, which were founded in the early 1850s during the California and Victoria gold rushes, respectively. A more modern example, in Montville, Connecticut, was caused by the displacement of Chinese workers in New York&#x27;s Manhattan Chinatown following the September 11th attacks in 2001.

==Definition==
Oxford Dictionaries defines &quot;Chinatown&quot; as &quot;...a district of any non-Asian town, especially a city or seaport, in which the population is predominantly of Chinese origin&quot;. However, some Chinatowns may have little to do with China. Some &quot;Vietnamese&quot; enclaves are in fact a city&#x27;s &quot;second Chinatown&quot;, and some Chinatowns are in fact pan-Asian, meaning they could also be counted as a Koreatown or Little India. One example includes Asiatown in Cleveland, Ohio. It was initially referred to as a Chinatown but was subsequently renamed due to the influx of non-Chinese Asian Americans who opened businesses there. Today the district acts as a unifying factor for the Chinese, Taiwanese, Korean, Japanese, Filipino, Indian, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Nepalese and Thai communities of Cleveland.

Further ambiguities with the term can include Chinese ethnoburbs which by definition are &quot;...suburban ethnic clusters of residential areas and business districts in large metropolitan areas An article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; blurs the line further by categorizing very different Chinatowns such as Chinatown, Manhattan, which exists in an urban setting as &quot;traditional&quot;; Monterey Park&#x27;s Chinatown, which exists in a &quot;suburban&quot; setting (and labeled as such); and Austin, Texas&#x27;s Chinatown, which is in essence a &quot;fabricated&quot; Chinese-themed mall. This contrasts with narrower definitions, where the term only described Chinatown in a city setting.

==History==

Trading centers populated predominantly by Chinese men and their native spouses have long existed throughout Southeast Asia. Emigration to other parts of the world from China accelerated in the 1860s with the signing of the Treaty of Peking (1860), which opened China&#x27;s borders to free movement. Early emigrants came primarily from the coastal provinces of Guangdong (Canton, Kwangtung) and Fujian (Fukien, Hokkien) in southeastern China – where the people generally speak Toishanese, Cantonese, Hakka, Teochew (Chiuchow) and Hokkien. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, a significant amount of Chinese emigration to North America originated from four counties called Sze Yup, located west of the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong province, making Toishanese a dominant variety of the Chinese language spoken in Chinatowns in Canada and the United States.

As conditions in China have improved in recent decades, many Chinatowns have lost their initial mission, which was to provide a transitional place into a new culture. As net migration has slowed into them, the smaller Chinatowns have slowly decayed, often to the point of becoming purely historical and no longer serving as ethnic enclaves.

===In Asia===

In the Spanish Philippines, where the oldest surviving Chinatowns are located, the district where Chinese migrants (&quot;sangleyes&quot;) were required to live is called a parián, which were also often a marketplace for trade goods. Most of them were established in the late 16th century to house Chinese migrants as part of the early Spanish colonial policy of ethnic segregation. There were numerous pariáns throughout the Philippines in various locations, the names of which still survive into modern district names. This include the Parián de Arroceros of Intramuros, Manila (which was eventually moved several times, ending up in Binondo). The term was also carried into Latin America by Filipino migrants. The central market place of Mexico City (now part of Zócalo) selling imported goods from the Manila galleons in the 18th and early 19th centuries was called &quot;Parián de Manila&quot; (or just &quot;Parián&quot;).

Along the coastal areas of Southeast Asia, several Chinese settlements existed as early as the 16th century according to Zheng He and Tomé Pires&#x27; travel accounts. Melaka during the Portuguese colonial period, for instance, had a large Chinese population in Campo China. They settled down at port towns under the authority&#x27;s approval for trading. After the European colonial powers seized and ruled the port towns in the 16th century, Chinese supported European traders and colonists, and created autonomous settlements.

Several Asian Chinatowns, although not yet called by that name, have a long history. Those in Nagasaki, Kobe, Kuwana, and Yokohama, Japan, Binondo in Manila, Hoi An and Bao Vinh in central Vietnam all existed in 1600. Glodok, the Chinese quarter of Jakarta, Indonesia, dates to 1740.

Chinese presence in India dates back to the 5th century CE, with the first recorded Chinese settler in Calcutta named Young Atchew around 1780. Chinatowns first appeared in the Indian cities of Kolkata, Mumbai, and Chennai.

The Chinatown centered on Yaowarat Road in Bangkok, Thailand, was founded at the same time as the city itself, in 1782.

===Outside of Asia===
 Many Chinese immigrants arrived in Liverpool in the late 1850s in the employ of the Blue Funnel Shipping Line, a cargo transport company established by Alfred Holt. The commercial shipping line created strong trade links between the cities of Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Liverpool, mainly in the importation of silk, cotton, and tea. They settled near the docks in south Liverpool, this area was heavily bombed during World War II, causing the Chinese community moving to the current location Liverpool Chinatown on Nelson Street.

The Chinatown in San Francisco is one of the largest in North America and the oldest north of Mexico. It served as a port of entry for early Chinese immigrants from the 1850s to the 1900s. The area was the one geographical region deeded by the city government and private property owners which allowed Chinese persons to inherit and inhabit dwellings within the city. Many Chinese found jobs working for large companies seeking a source of labor, most famously as part of the Central Pacific on the Transcontinental Railroad. Since it started in Omaha, that city had a notable Chinatown for almost a century. Other cities in North America where Chinatowns were founded in the mid-nineteenth century include almost every major settlement along the West Coast from San Diego to Victoria. Other early immigrants worked as mine workers or independent prospectors hoping to strike it rich during the 1849 Gold Rush.

Economic opportunity drove the building of further Chinatowns in the United States. The initial Chinatowns were built in the Western United States in states such as California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, Colorado and Arizona. As the transcontinental railroad was built, more Chinatowns started to appear in railroad towns such as St. Louis, Chicago, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh and Butte, Montana. Chinatowns then subsequently emerged in many East Coast cities, including New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Providence and Baltimore. With the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation, many southern states such as Arkansas, Louisiana and Georgia began to hire Chinese for work in place of slave labor.

The history of Chinatowns was not always peaceful, especially when labor disputes arose. Racial tensions flared when lower-paid Chinese workers replaced white miners in many mountain-area Chinatowns, such as in Wyoming with the Rock Springs Massacre. Many of these frontier Chinatowns became extinct as American racism surged and the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed.

In Australia, the Victorian gold rush, which began in 1851, attracted Chinese prospectors from the Guangdong area. A community began to form in the eastern end of Little Bourke Street, Melbourne by the mid-1850s; the area is still the center of the Melbourne Chinatown, making it the oldest continuously occupied Chinatown in a western city (since the San Francisco one was destroyed and rebuilt). Gradually expanding, it reached a peak in the early 20th century, with Chinese business, mainly furniture workshops, occupying a block wide swath of the city, overlapping into the adjacent &#x27;Little Lon&#x27; red light district. With restricted immigration it shrunk again, becoming a strip of Chinese restaurants by the late 1970s, when it was celebrated with decorative arches. However, with a recent huge influx of students from mainland China, it is now the center of a much larger area of noodle shops, travel agents, restaurants, and groceries. The Australian gold rushes also saw the development of a Chinatown in Sydney, at first around The Rocks, near the docks, but it has moved twice, first in the 1890s to the east side of the Haymarket area, near the new markets, then in the 1920s concentrating on the west side. Nowadays, Sydney&#x27;s Chinatown is centered on Dixon Street.

Other Chinatowns in European capitals, including Paris and London, were established at the turn of the 20th century. The first Chinatown in London was located in the Limehouse area of the East End of London at the start of the 20th century. The Chinese population engaged in business which catered to the Chinese sailors who frequented the Docklands. The area acquired a bad reputation from exaggerated reports of opium dens and slum housing.

France received a large settlement of Chinese immigrant laborers, mostly from the city of Wenzhou, in the Zhejiang province of China. Significant Chinatowns sprung up in Belleville and the 13th arrondissement of Paris.
===1970s to the present===
By the late 1970s, refugees and exiles from the Vietnam War played a significant part in the redevelopment of Chinatowns in developed Western countries. As a result, many existing Chinatowns have become pan-Asian business districts and residential neighborhoods. By contrast, most Chinatowns in the past had been largely inhabited by Chinese from southeastern China.

In 2001, the events of September 11 resulted in a mass migration of about 14,000 Chinese workers from Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown to Montville, Connecticut, due to the fall of the garment industry. Chinese workers transitioned to casino jobs fueled by the development of the Mohegan Sun casino.

In 2012, Tijuana&#x27;s Chinatown formed as a result of availability of direct flights to China. The La Mesa District of Tijuana was formerly a small enclave, but has tripled in size as a result of direct flights to Shanghai. It has an ethnic Chinese population rise from 5,000 in 2009 to roughly 15,000 in 2012, overtaking Mexicali&#x27;s Chinatown as the largest Chinese enclave in Mexico.

The New York metropolitan area, consisting of New York City, Long Island, and nearby areas within the states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, is home to the largest Chinese-American population of any metropolitan area within the United States and the largest Chinese population outside of China, enumerating an estimated 893,697 in 2017, and including at least 12 Chinatowns, including nine in New York City proper alone. Steady immigration from mainland China, both legal and illegal, has fueled Chinese-American population growth in the New York metropolitan area. New York&#x27;s status as an alpha global city, its extensive mass transit system, and the New York metropolitan area&#x27;s enormous economic marketplace are among the many reasons it remains a major international immigration hub. The Manhattan Chinatown contains the largest concentration of ethnic Chinese in the Western hemisphere, and the Flushing Chinatown in Queens has become the world&#x27;s largest Chinatown.

The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected tourism and business in Chinatown, San Francisco and Chinatown, Chicago, Illinois as well as others worldwide.

*People of Fujian province used to move over the South China Sea from the 14th century to look for more stable jobs, in most cases of trading and fishery, and settled down near the port/jetty under approval of the local authority such as Magong (Penghu), Hoian (Vietnam), Songkla (Thailand), Malacca (Malaysia), Banten, Semarang, Tuban (Indonesia), Manila (the Philippines), etc. A large number of this kind of settlements was developed along the coastal areal of the South China Sea, and was called &quot;Campon China&quot; by Portuguese account and &quot;China Town&quot; by English account.

===Settlement pattern===
*The settlement was developed along a jetty and protected by Mazu temple, which was dedicated for the Goddess of Sea for safe sailing. Market place was open in front of Mazu temple, and shophouses were built along the street leading from west side of the Mazu temple. At the end of the street, Tudigong (Land God) temple was placed. As the settlement prospered as commercial town, Kuan Ti temple would be added for commercial success, especially by people from Hong Kong and Guangdong province. This core pattern was maintained even the settlement got expanded as a city, and forms historical urban center of the Southeast Asia.
==Characteristics==
The features described below are characteristic of many modern Chinatowns.

===Demographics===
The early Chinatowns such as those in San Francisco and Los Angeles in the United States were naturally destinations for people of Chinese descent as migration were the result of opportunities such as the California Gold Rush and the Transcontinental Railroad drawing the population in, creating natural Chinese enclaves that were almost always 100% exclusively Han Chinese, which included both people born in China and in the enclave, in this case American-born Chinese. In some free countries such as the United States and Canada, housing laws that prevent discrimination also allows neighborhoods that may have been characterized as &quot;All Chinese&quot; to also allow non-Chinese to reside in these communities. For example, the Chinatown in Philadelphia has a sizeable non-Chinese population residing within the community.

A recent study also suggests that the demographic change is also driven by gentrification of what were previously Chinatown neighborhoods. The influx of luxury housing is speeding up the gentrification of such neighborhoods. The trend for emergence of these types of natural enclaves is on the decline (with the exceptions being the continued growth and emergence of newer Chinatowns in Queens and Brooklyn in New York City), only to be replaced by newer &quot;Disneyland-like&quot; attractions, such as a new Chinatown that will be built in the Catskills region of New York. This includes the endangerment of existing historical Chinatowns that will eventually stop serving the needs of Chinese immigrants.

Newer developments like those in Norwich, Connecticut, and the San Gabriel Valley, which are not necessarily considered &quot;Chinatowns&quot; in the sense that they do not necessarily contain the Chinese architectures or Chinese language signs as signatures of an officially sanctioned area that was designated either in law or signage stating so, differentiate areas that are called &quot;Chinatowns&quot; versus locations that have &quot;significant&quot; populations of people of Chinese descent. For example, San Jose, California in the United States has 63,434 people (2010 U.S. Census) of Chinese descent, and yet &quot;does not have a Chinatown&quot;. Some &quot;official&quot; Chinatowns have Chinese populations much lower than that.

===Town-Scape===

Many tourist-destination metropolitan Chinatowns can be distinguished by large red arch entrance structures known in Mandarin Chinese as &quot;Paifang&quot; (sometimes accompanied by imperial guardian lion statues on either side of the structure, to greet visitors). Other Chinese architectural styles such as the Chinese Garden of Friendship in Sydney Chinatown and the Chinese stone lions at the gate to the Victoria, British Columbia Chinatown are present in some Chinatowns. Mahale Chiniha, the Chinatown in Iran, contains many buildings that were constructed in the Chinese architectural style.

Paifangs usually have special inscriptions in Chinese. Historically, these gateways were donated to a particular city as a gift from the Republic of China and People&#x27;s Republic of China, or local governments (such as Chinatown, San Francisco) and business organizations. The long-neglected Chinatown in Havana, Cuba, received materials for its paifang from the People&#x27;s Republic of China as part of the Chinatown&#x27;s gradual renaissance. Construction of these red arches is often financed by local financial contributions from the Chinatown community. Some of these structures span an entire intersection, and some are smaller in height and width. Some paifang can be made of wood, masonry or steel and may incorporate an elaborate or simple design.

==Benevolent and business associations==

A major component of many Chinatowns is the family benevolent association, which provides some degree of aid to immigrants. These associations generally provide social support, religious services, death benefits (members&#x27; names in Chinese are generally enshrined on tablets and posted on walls), meals, and recreational activities for ethnic Chinese, especially for older Chinese migrants. Membership in these associations can be based on members sharing a common Chinese surname or belonging to a common clan, spoken Chinese dialect, specific village, region or country of origin, and so on. Many have their own facilities.

Some examples include San Francisco&#x27;s prominent Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (中華總會館 &quot;Zhōnghuá Zǒng Huìguǎn&quot;), aka Chinese Six Companies and Los Angeles&#x27; Southern California Teochew Association. The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association is among the largest umbrella groups of benevolent associations in the North America, which branches in several Chinatowns. Politically, the CCBA has traditionally been aligned with the Kuomintang and the Republic of China.

The London Chinatown Chinese Association is active in Chinatown, London. Chinatown, Paris has an institution in the &quot;Association des Résidents en France d&#x27;origine indochinoise&quot; and it servicing overseas Chinese immigrants in Paris who were born in the former French Indochina.

Traditionally, Chinatown-based associations have also been aligned with ethnic Chinese business interests, such as restaurant, grocery, and laundry (antiquated) associations in Chinatowns in North America. In Chicago&#x27;s Chinatown, the On Leong Merchants Association was active.

==Names==

===English===

Although the term &quot;Chinatown&quot; was first used in Asia, it is not derived from a Chinese language. Its earliest appearance seems to have been in connection with the Chinese quarter of Singapore, which by 1844 was already being called &quot;China Town&quot; or &quot;Chinatown&quot; by the British colonial government. This may have been a word-for-word translation into English of the Malay name for that quarter, which in those days was probably &quot;Kampong China&quot; or possibly &quot;Kota China&quot; or &quot;Kampong Tionghua/Chunghwa/Zhonghua&quot;.

The first appearance of a Chinatown outside Singapore may have been in 1852, in a book by the Rev. Hatfield, who applied the term to the Chinese part of the main settlement on the remote South Atlantic island of St. Helena. The island was a regular way-station on the voyage to Europe and North America from Indian Ocean ports, including Singapore.
One of the earliest American usages dates to 1855, when San Francisco newspaper &quot;The Daily Alta California&quot; described a &quot;pitched battle on the streets of [SF&#x27;s] Chinatown&quot;. Other &quot;Alta&quot; articles from the late 1850s make it clear that areas called &quot;Chinatown&quot; existed at that time in several other California cities, including Oroville and San Andres. By 1869, &quot;Chinatown had acquired its full modern meaning all over the U.S. and Canada. For instance, an Ohio newspaper wrote: &quot;From San Diego to Sitka..., every town and hamlet has its &#x27;Chinatown&#x27;.&quot;

In British publications before the 1890s, &quot;Chinatown&quot; appeared mainly in connection with California. At first, Australian and New Zealand journalists also regarded Chinatowns as Californian phenomena. However, they began using the term to denote local Chinese communities as early as 1861 in Australia and 1873 in New Zealand. In most other countries, the custom of calling local Chinese communities &quot;Chinatowns&quot; is not older than the twentieth century.

Several alternate English names for Chinatown include China Town (generally used in British and Australian English), The Chinese District, Chinese Quarter and China Alley (an antiquated term used primarily in several rural towns in the western United States for a Chinese community; some of these are now historical sites). In the case of Lillooet, British Columbia, Canada, China Alley was a parallel commercial street adjacent to the town&#x27;s Main Street, enjoying a view over the river valley adjacent and also over the main residential part of Chinatown, which was largely of adobe construction. All traces of Chinatown and China Alley there have disappeared, despite a once large and prosperous community.

===In Chinese===

In Chinese, Chinatown is usually called , in Cantonese &quot;Tong jan gai&quot;, in Mandarin &quot;Tángrénjiē&quot;, in Hakka &quot;Tong ngin gai&quot;, and in Toisan &quot;Hong ngin gai&quot;, literally meaning &quot;Tang people&#x27;s street(s)&quot;. The Tang dynasty was a zenith of the Chinese civilization, after which some Chinese call themselves. Some Chinatowns are indeed just one single street, such as the relatively short Fisgard Street in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.

A more modern Chinese name is (Cantonese: Waa Fau, Mandarin: Huábù) meaning &quot;Chinese City&quot;, used in the semi-official Chinese translations of some cities&#x27; documents and signs. &quot;Bù&quot;, pronounced sometimes in Mandarin as &quot;fù&quot;, usually means &quot;seaport&quot;; but in this sense, it means &quot;city&quot; or &quot;town&quot;. &quot;Tong jan fau&quot; ( &quot;Tang people&#x27;s town&quot;) is also used in Cantonese nowadays. The literal word-for-word translation of &quot;Chinatown&quot;—&quot;Zhōngguó Chéng&quot; () is also used, but more frequently by visiting Chinese nationals rather than immigrants of Chinese descent who live in various Chinatowns.

Chinatowns in Southeast Asia have unique Chinese names used by the local Chinese, as there are large populations of people who are Overseas Chinese, living within the various major cities of Southeast Asia. As the population of Overseas Chinese, is widely dispersed in various enclaves, across each major Southeast Asian city, specific Chinese names are used instead.

For example, in Singapore, where 2.8 million ethnic Chinese constitute a majority 74% of the resident population, the Chinese name for Chinatown is &quot;Niúchēshǔi&quot; (, Hokkien POJ: &quot;Gû-chia-chúi&quot;), which literally means &quot;ox-cart water&quot; from the Malay &#x27;Kreta Ayer&#x27; in reference to the water carts that used to ply the area. The Chinatown in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, (where 2 million ethnic Chinese comprise 30% of the population of Greater Kuala Lumpur) while officially known as Petaling Street (Malay: &quot;Jalan Petaling&quot;), is referred to by Malaysian Chinese by its Cantonese name &quot;ci4 cong2 gaai1&quot; (, pinyin: &quot;Cíchǎng Jiē&quot;), literally &quot;tapioca factory street&quot;, after a tapioca starch factory that once stood in the area. In Manila, Philippines, the area is called Mínlúnluò Qū , literally meaning the &quot;Mín and Luò Rivers confluence district&quot; but is actually a transliteration of the local term &quot;Binondo&quot; and an allusion to its proximity to the Pasig River.

===Other languages===
In Philippine Spanish, the term used for Chinatown districts is parián, the etymology of which is uncertain. In the rest of the Spanish Empire, the Spanish-language term is usually barrio chino (&quot;Chinese neighborhood&quot;; plural: &quot;barrios chinos&quot;), used in Spain and Latin America. (However, &quot;barrio chino&quot; or its Catalan cognate &quot;barri xinès&quot; do not always refer to a Chinese neighborhood: these are also common terms for a disreputable district with drugs and prostitution, and often no connection to the Chinese.).

In Portuguese, Chinatown is often referred to as Bairro chinês (&quot;the Chinese Neighbourhood&quot;; plural: &quot;bairros chineses&quot;).

In Francophone regions (such as France and Quebec), Chinatown is often referred to as le quartier chinois (&quot;the Chinese Neighbourhood&quot;; plural: &quot;les quartiers chinois&quot;). The most prominent Francophone Chinatowns are located in Paris and Montreal.

The Vietnamese term for Chinatown is &quot;Khu người Hoa&quot; (Chinese district) or &quot;phố Tàu&quot; (Chinese street). Vietnamese language is prevalent in Chinatowns of Paris, Los Angeles, Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, and Montreal as ethnic Chinese from Vietnam have set up shop in them.

In Japanese, the term &quot;chūkagai&quot; (中華街, literally &quot;Chinese Street&quot;) is the translation used for Yokohama and Nagasaki Chinatown.

In Indonesia, chinatown is known as Pecinan, a shortened term of &quot;pe-cina-an&quot;, means everything related to the Chinese people. Most of these pecinans usually located in Java.

Some languages have adopted the English-language term, such as Dutch and German.

==Locations==
===Africa===

There are three noteworthy Chinatowns in Africa located in the coastal African nations of Madagascar, Mauritius and South Africa. South Africa has the largest Chinatown and the largest Chinese population of any African country and remains a popular destination for Chinese immigrants coming to Africa. Derrick Avenue in Cyrildene, Johannesburg, hosts South Africa&#x27;s largest Chinatown.

===America===
In the Americas, which includes North America, Central America and South America, Chinatowns have been around since the 1800s. The most prominent ones exist in the United States and Canada in New York, Boston, San Francisco, Chicago, Toronto and Vancouver. The New York City metropolitan area is home to the largest ethnically Chinese population outside of Asia, comprising an estimated 893,697 uniracial individuals as of 2017, including at least 12 Chinatowns – six (or nine, including the emerging Chinatowns in Corona and Whitestone, Queens, and East Harlem, Manhattan) in New York City proper, and one each in Nassau County, Long Island; Edison, New Jersey; and Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey, not to mention fledgling ethnic Chinese enclaves emerging throughout the New York City metropolitan area. San Francisco, a Pacific port city, has the oldest and longest continuous running Chinatown in the Western Hemisphere. In Canada, The Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area is home to the 2nd largest ethnically Chinese population outside of Asia, comprising 694,970 individuals as of the 2021 Census. Vancouver&#x27;s Chinatown is the country&#x27;s largest.

The oldest Chinatown in the Americas is in Mexico City and dates back to at least the early 17th century. Since the 1970s, new arrivals have typically hailed from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Latin American Chinatowns may include the descendants of original migrants – often of mixed Chinese and Latin parentage – and more recent immigrants from East Asia. Most Asian Latin Americans are of Cantonese and Hakka origin. Estimates widely vary on the number of Chinese descendants in Latin America. Notable Chinatowns also exist in Chinatown, Lima, Peru.

In Brazil, the Liberdade neighborhood in São Paulo has, along with a large Japanese community, an important Chinese community. There is a project for a Chinatown in the Mercado neighborhood, close to the Municipal Market and the commercial Rua 25 de Março.

===Asia===

Chinatowns in Asia are widespread with a large concentration of overseas Chinese in East Asia and Southeast Asia and ethnic Chinese whose ancestors came from southern China – particularly the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Hainan – and settled in countries such as Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam centuries ago—starting as early as the Tang dynasty, but mostly notably in the 17th through the 19th centuries (during the reign of the Qing dynasty), and well into the 20th century. Today the Chinese diaspora in Asia is largely concentrated in Southeast Asia however the legacy of the once widespread overseas Chinese communities in Asia is evident in the many Chinatowns that are found across East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.

Vietnam houses the largest Chinatown by size in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon).

===Australia and Oceania===

The Chinatown of Melbourne lies within the Melbourne central business district and centers on the eastern end of Little Bourke Street. It extends between the corners of Swanston and Exhibition Streets. Melbourne&#x27;s Chinatown originated during the Victorian gold rush in 1851, and is notable as the oldest Chinatown in Australia. It has also been claimed to be the longest continuously running Chinese community outside of Asia, but only because the 1906 San Francisco earthquake all but destroyed the Chinatown in San Francisco in California.

Sydney&#x27;s main Chinatown centers on Sussex Street in the Sydney downtown. It stretches from Central Station in the east to Darling Harbour in the west, and is Australia&#x27;s largest Chinatown.

The Chinatown of Adelaide was originally built in the 1960s and was renovated in the 1980s. It is located near Adelaide Central Market and the Adelaide Central bus station.

Chinatown Gold Coast is a precinct in the Central Business District of Southport, Queensland, that runs through Davenport Street and Young Street. The precinct extends between Nerang Street in the north and Garden Street/Scarborough Street east-west. Redevelopment of the precinct was established in 2013 and completed in 2015 in time for Chinese New Year celebrations.

There are additional Chinatowns in Brisbane, Perth, and Broome in Australia.


===Europe===

Several urban Chinatowns exist in major European capital cities. There is Chinatown, London, England as well as major Chinatowns in Birmingham, Liverpool, Newcastle, and Manchester. Berlin, Germany has one established Chinatown in the area around Kantstrasse of Charlottenburg in the West. Antwerp, Belgium has also seen an upstart Chinese community, that has been recognized by the local authorities since 2011. The city council of Cardiff has plans to recognize the Chinese Diaspora in the city.

The Chinatown in Paris, located in the 13th arrondissement, is the largest in Europe, where many Vietnamese – specifically ethnic Chinese refugees from Vietnam – have settled and in Belleville in the northeast of Paris as well as in Lyon. In Italy, there is a Chinatown in Milan between Via Luigi Canonica and Via Paolo Sarpi and others in Rome and Prato. In the Netherlands, Chinatowns exist in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and the Hague.

In the United Kingdom, several exist in Birmingham, Liverpool, London, Manchester and Newcastle Upon Tyne. The Chinatown in Liverpool is the oldest Chinese community in Europe. The Chinatown in London was established in the Limehouse district in the late 19th century. The Chinatown in Manchester is located in central Manchester.

==In popular culture==
Chinatowns have been portrayed in various films including &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot;, &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot;, &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot;, &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;, &quot;The Lady from Shanghai&quot; and &quot;Chinatown&quot;. Within the context of the last film &quot;Chinatown&quot; is used primarily as an extended metaphor for any situation in which an outside entity seeks to intervene without having the local knowledge required to understand the consequences of that intervention. The neighborhood or district is often associated with being outside the normal rule of law or isolated from the social norms of the larger society.

Chinatowns have also been mentioned in the song &quot;Kung Fu Fighting&quot; by Carl Douglas whose song lyrics says &quot;...There was funky China men from funky Chinatown...&quot;

The martial arts actor Bruce Lee is well known as a person who was born in the Chinatown of San Francisco. Other notable Chinese Americans such as politician Gary Locke and NBA player Jeremy Lin grew up in suburbs with lesser connections to traditional Chinatowns. Neighborhood activists and politicians have increased in prominence in some cities, and some are starting to attract support from non-Chinese voters.

ISSN 0047-9462 Oral history (1981) describes the Chinatown of Winnemucca, Nevada, during 1901–10. Though many Chinese left Winnemucca after the Central Pacific Railroad was completed in 1869, around four hundred Chinese had formed a community in the town by the 1890s. Among the prominent buildings was the Joss House, a place of worship and celebration that was visited by Chinese revolutionist Sun Yat-Sen in 1911.

<text>A skateboarding trick, or simply a trick, is a maneuver performed by manipulating a skateboard, usually with one&#x27;s feet, in a specific way to achieve the desired outcome – the trick.

==History==
Though skateboards emerged in the 1900s, skateboarding tricks like the ones done today did not appear until decades later. In the 1970s and earlier, the most common tricks were &quot;2D&quot; freestyle types such as manuals and pivots. Only later in the 1980s and early 1990s were common modern-day tricks like the ollie and heel-flip invented by Alan Gelfand and Rodney Mullen, setting the stage for other aerial tricks. The invention of these tricks changed the skateboarding lifestyle for many years to come.

==Types==

===Ollie===

An ollie is a jump where the front wheels leave the ground first. This motion is attained with a snap of the tail (from the back foot) and sliding one&#x27;s front foot forward to reach any altitude. A lot of technical tricks transpire from this element (e.g. the kickflip, heelflip, 360-flip). A &quot;nollie&quot; is when the back wheels leave the ground first by snapping the nose of the board, with the back foot sliding towards the tail. There is also a switch ollie, which is simply an ollie in switch stance position. The switch stance position is the opposite position of how the rider would normally ride.

===Grabs===
A grab involves floating in the air, while using either hand to hold the board against the feet or keeping constant and careful pressure on the board with the feet to keep it from floating away. The Indy grab usually combines rotation with different grabs. This class of tricks was first popularized when Tony Hawk became famous for his frontside airs in empty swimming pools in the late 1970s and has expanded to include the bulk of skateboarding tricks to this day, including the ollie and all of its variations. The 900 and 1080 fall under the class of aerials, though these are commonly confused with aerial grabs.

===Flip tricks===


Flip tricks are a subset of aerials which are all based on the ollie. An example is the kickflip, the most widely known and performed flip trick. The board can be spun around many different axes as part of a flip trick, thus combining several rotations into one trick. These tricks are undoubtedly most popular among street skateboarding purists, although skaters with other styles perform them as well. The famous placing of the board on the feet and then jumping was created in 1987 by Nathan Lipor. Combining spins and flips is extremely popular in today&#x27;s culture. A common trick in skateboarding lines is a 360 flip, or tre flip. A 360 flip is the combination of a skateboard spinning 360 degrees and a kickflip. There are also double kickflips and triple kickflips, which are very difficult.

===Freestyle===
Freestyle skateboarding tricks are tricks specifically associated with freestyle skateboarding. They are part of the building blocks and some of the most important reference points for tricks which have evolved to form street skateboarding.

===Slides and grinds===
Slides and grinds involve getting the board up on some type of ledge, rail, or coping and sliding or grinding along the board or trucks, respectively. When it is primarily the board which is contacting the edge, it is called a slide; when it is the truck, it is a grind. Grinding and sliding skateboards started with sliding the board on parking blocks and curbs, then extended to using the coping on swimming pools, then stairway handrails, and has now been expanded to include almost every possible type of edge. Grinds and slides on street environments were brought to mainstream skateboarding by professional skateboarders Natas Kaupas and Mark Gonzales.

===Manuals===

A manual is a balancing trick where a skateboarder balances on either the front two or rear two wheels, without the other two wheels or any other part of the skateboard touching the ground for the entire duration of the trick. The trick is often performed at speed and technical skateboarders such as Daewon Song are renowned for performing tricks such as the kickflip both in and out of the trick, whilst also simultaneously doing so up onto, over and off ledges, blocks, benches and other street obstacles.

<text>The photosphere is a star&#x27;s outer shell from which light is radiated. It extends into a star&#x27;s surface until the plasma becomes opaque, equivalent to an optical depth of approximately , or equivalently, a depth from which 50% of light will escape without being scattered.

A photosphere is the region of a luminous object, usually a star, that is transparent to photons of certain wavelengths.

Stars, except neutron stars, have no solid or liquid surface. Therefore, the photosphere is typically used to describe the Sun&#x27;s or another star&#x27;s visual surface.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;photosphere&quot; is derived from Ancient Greek roots, φῶς, φωτός/&quot;phos&quot;, &quot;photos&quot; meaning &quot;light&quot; and σφαῖρα/&quot;sphaira&quot; meaning &quot;sphere&quot;, in reference to it being a spherical surface that is perceived to emit light.

== Temperature ==

The surface of a star is defined to have a temperature given by the effective temperature in the Stefan–Boltzmann law. Various stars have photospheres of various temperatures.

== Composition of the Sun ==
The Sun is composed primarily of the chemical elements hydrogen and helium; they account for 74.9% and 23.8%, respectively, of the mass of the Sun in the photosphere. All heavier elements, colloquially called &quot;metals&quot; in stellar astronomy, account for less than 2% of the mass, with oxygen (roughly 1% of the Sun&#x27;s mass), carbon (0.3%), neon (0.2%), and iron (0.2%) being the most abundant.

== Sun&#x27;s photosphere ==
The Sun&#x27;s photosphere has a temperature between (with an effective temperature of ) meaning human eyes perceive it as an overwhelmingly bright surface, and with sufficiently strong neutral density filter, as a hueless, gray surface. It has a density of about 3 kg/m3; increasing with increasing depth. The Sun&#x27;s photosphere is 100–400 kilometers thick.

== Photospheric phenomena ==
In the Sun&#x27;s photosphere, the most ubiquitous phenomenon are granules—convection cells of plasma each approximately in diameter with hot rising plasma in the center and cooler plasma falling in the spaces between them, flowing at velocities of . Each granule has a lifespan of only about twenty minutes, resulting in a continually shifting &quot;boiling&quot; pattern. Grouping the typical granules are supergranules up to in diameter with lifespans of up to 24 hours and flow speeds of about , carrying magnetic field bundles to the edges of the cells. Other magnetically related phenomena in the Sun&#x27;s photosphere include sunspots and solar faculae dispersed between granules. These features are too fine to be directly observed on other stars; however, sunspots have been indirectly observed, in which case they are referred to as &quot;starspots&quot;.

<text>Boardsports are active outdoor sports that are played with any sort of board as the primary equipment. These sports take place on a variety of terrains, from paved flat-ground and snow-covered hills to water and air. Most boardsports are considered action sports or extreme sports, and thus often appeal to youth. Some board sports were marginalized in the past. However, many board sports are gaining mainstream recognition, and with this recognition, they have gotten wider broadcasting, sponsorship and inclusion in institutional sporting events, including the Olympic Games.

Surfing is the first known boardsport, originating from Polynesian culture. Skateboarding was then invented by surfers looking to &quot;surf&quot; on land. It is hard to estimate when most boardsports were invented because people have been making homemade versions throughout history. For example, it is not hard to conceive of a person, who is familiar with the concept of skiing or sledding, standing sideways on a plank of wood and riding down a snow-covered slope. M.J. &quot;Jack&quot; Burchett is credited with first doing this in 1929, using horse reins and clothesline to secure his feet on the plank of wood. Most boardsports have similar, equally unknown origins.

Using data collected in the past decade, it is estimated there are 18-50 million skateboarders, 5-25 million surfers, and 10-20 million snowboarders in the world. Approximately 100 million people participate in boardsports worldwide.

==Classifications== 
There are a variety of board sports, which are characterized by terrain: Surf, Snow, Wake, Skate are the primary.

===Water===

;Surfing: The grandfather of all board sports, surfing is a surface water sport that involves the participant being carried by a breaking wave.
;Stand Up Paddle Surfing (SUP):A variant of surfing where one always a stands up on the board and propels oneself by a one-bladed paddle, without lying down on the board. Although originally the goal was to catch and surf the waves, a racing modality has emerged with similarities to kayaking.
;Skimboarding (1930s) :A discipline of surfing involving riding a board on wet sand or shallow water. A predominantly recreational activity that has evolved into a highly competitive water sport.
;Windsurfing (1970) : Also known as &quot;sailboarding&quot;. A water sport involving travel over water on a small 2–4.7 metre board powered by wind acting on a single sail. The sail is connected to the board by a flexible joint
;Bodyboarding (1971) : Wave riding consisting of a small, roughly rectangular piece of foam, shaped to a hydrodynamic form. The bodyboard is ridden predominantly lying down, (or &#x27;prone&#x27;). It can also be ridden in a half-standing stance (known as &#x27;dropknee&#x27;) or can even be ridden standing up.
;Kneeboarding (1973) :A discipline of surfing where the rider paddles on his belly into a wave on a kneeboard, then rides the wave face typically on both knees.
;Riverboarding (1978) : A boardsport in which the participant is prone on the board with fins on his/her feet for propulsion and steering.
;Wakeboarding (1983) : A surface watersport created from a combination of water skiing, snow boarding and surfing techniques. As in water skiing, the rider is towed behind a boat, or a cable skiing setup.
;Skurfing (1984) :Another fast growing boardsport is skurfing a mix of surfing and more conventional water sports in which the participant is towed behind the boat.
;Flowriding (1991) : Similar to surfing but done on a man-made artificial sheet wave.
;Wakeskating (1990s) :A rider is pulled behind a boat on a wakeskate which is smaller than a wakeboard and has no bindings with a foam or griptape surface.
;Kitesurfing (1996) : Also known as &quot;kiteboarding&quot;. Boards similar to those known from windsurfing or wakeboarding are propelled by an inflatable or foil power kite, allowing for high speeds and high jumps. Other variations are to use a wheeled board or buggy on land, or skis or a snowboard on snow.
; Wakesurfing (1997) : A rider is pulled behind a boat on a mini surfboard and can ride the boat&#x27;s wake with no rope.

===Land===
====Paved surface====

;Skateboarding (1950) : Uses a board mounted on wheels, and often ridden on a half-pipe, in urban settings, or emptied specially built swimming pools. 
;Longboarding (1970s) : Similar to freeboarding but with long skateboards that come in different shapes and sizes, longboarding is mostly a racing sport but there are many other styles as well.
;Snakeboard (1989) : Similar to skateboarding, but also influenced heavily by snowboarding, uses a board broken into three connected pieces that move together in order to generate momentum. 
;Freestyle scootering (1996) : an action sport which involves using scooters to perform freestyle tricks, in a manner similar to skateboarding and BMX freestyle.
; Carveboarding : A board that has wheels similar to a car except smaller, it turns better than most boards on four wheels, its main purpose is to cruise and carve, it can turn 65 degrees, and has spring-loaded trucks that are almost as unique as a flowboards trucks.
;Freeboarding: Often said to be the board whose feel is the most similar to snowboarding. There are two extra castor wheels in the middle of the base that are somewhat lower than the other four. This allows the rider to distribute his weight to only one &quot;edge&quot;, as in snowboarding. This gives the rider the ability to slide, an ability no other land board has besides the longboard.
;Caster board : Two narrow platforms known as &quot;decks&quot; are adjoined by a rubber or aluminium coated metal beam that houses a strong spring. Each truck has one wheel that is connected to the board in such a way that each wheel can rotate independently. Both wheels are mounted on slants that measure around 30° in angle, facing away from the front of the board. Similar to Vigorboard (2003) : Constructed from two platforms, each supported by a single caster with a single wheel giving the board a total of two wheels. the two platforms are connected by heavy metal torsion bar that enables the board to twist in the centre.
; Street Skurfing : Similar to Caster board, but the rider can move both feet independently.
; Freeline skates (2000&#x27;s) : A pair of skates designed to give the feeling of skateboarding, snowboarding, surfing, and inline skates all in one. Freeline Skates are extremely portable, making them the smallest and lightest form of transportation. See also Street Skurfing.
; Street surfing : A split deck board connected by a spring rod to allow each half of the board to twist independently from the other, each side only having 1 caster wheel, allowing for tight maneuvers and self propulsion.
; On-shore boards: A type of board that has four inline wheels and four in the back (two on each side) and is deeply concave in the front.
;T-boarding :A skateboard deck with two wheels that can spin 360 degrees.

====Off-paved surface====

;Land windsurfing: A sport similar to traditional windsurfing that is performed on land rather than water. A four-wheeled deck, similar to a mountain board or skateboard deck, is commonly used in conjunction with a mast and sail in order to project the board across land.
;Mountainboarding (1992) : Similar to snowboarding, but on snowless peaks (in between winter seasons). The board is wider and sturdier. Mountainboarding is similar to skateboarding in the way that mountainbiking is similar to regular biking.
;Kite landboarding: Similar to Kite Surfing but the kite is used to pull the rider along flat ground (often a hard packed sandy beach) on a mountainboard

====Snow====

;Snowboarding (1977) :A cross between skateboarding and skiing, the board medium is snow, although the condition of the snow can have a major impact on snowboarding style and technique. The four subcategories are freeride, freestyle, alpine and powder.
;Snowskating (1998) :This is similar to snowboarding but there are no bindings used. Instead the snow skate has a foam grip similar to griptape, enabling you to do skateboard style tricks. There are four main types of snowskates: Single deck (a skateboard-deck-like platform made out of either wood and/or plastic; Bilevel (similar to a skate board but, instead of trucks and wheels, a small ski with metal edges called a subdeck is used with special trucks to be used on a ski hill); 4x4 (a skateboard but the wheels are replaced by very small skis); Powderskate (can either be like a Bilevel snowskate or a single deck snowskate but longer and wider).
;Snowkiting: This is when a kite is used to pull a snowboarder along.

====Sand====

;Sandboarding: A recreational activity similar to snowboarding that takes place on sand dunes rather than snow-covered hills.

===Air===

;Skysurfing: A kind of skydiving in which the skydiver wears a board attached to their feet and performs surfing-style aerobatics during freefall.

<doc id="38985" wikidata="Q472827" url="?curid=38985" title="Water skiing">
<text>Water skiing (also waterskiing or water-skiing) is a surface water sport in which an individual is pulled behind a boat or a cable ski installation over a body of water, skimming the surface on two skis or one ski. The sport requires sufficient area on a stretch of water, one or two skis, a tow boat with tow rope, two or three people (depending on local boating laws), and a personal flotation device. In addition, the skier must have adequate upper and lower body strength, muscular endurance, and good balance.

There are water ski participants around the world, in Asia and Australia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. In the United States alone, there are approximately 11 million water skiers and over 900 sanctioned water ski competitions every year. Australia boasts 1.3 million water skiers.

There are many options for recreational or competitive water skiers. These include speed skiing, trick skiing, show skiing, slaloming, jumping, barefoot skiing and wakeski. Similar, related sports are wakeboarding, kneeboarding, discing, tubing, and sit-down hydrofoil.

==Basic technique==

Water skiers can start their ski set in one of two ways: wet is the most common, but dry is possible. Water skiing typically begins with a deep-water start. The skier enters the water with their skis on or they jump in without the skis on their feet, having the skis floated to them, and put them on while in the water. Most times it can be easier to put the skis on when they are wet. Once the skier has their skis on they will be thrown a tow rope from the boat, which they position between their skis or, if on only one ski, to the left if right foot forward and to the right if left foot forward. In the deep-water start, the skier crouches down in the water while holding onto the ski rope; they are in a cannonball position with their legs tucked into their chest, with skis pointing towards the sky and approximately of the ski out of the water. The skier can also perform a &quot;dry start&quot; by standing on the shore or a pier; however, this type of entry is recommended for professionals only. When the skier is ready (usually acknowledged by them yelling &quot;in gear,&quot;: followed by &quot;hit it&quot;), the driver accelerates the boat. As the boat accelerates and takes up the slack on the rope, the skier allows the boat to pull them out of the water by applying some muscle strength to get into an upright body position.

By leaning back and keeping the legs slightly bent, the skis will eventually plane out and the skier will start to glide over the water. The skier turns by shifting weight left or right. The skier&#x27;s body weight should be balanced between the balls of the feet and the heels. While being towed, the skier&#x27;s arms should be relaxed but still fully extended so as to reduce stress on the arms. The handle can be held vertically or horizontally, depending on whichever position is more comfortable for the skier.

In addition to the driver and the skier, a third person known as the &quot;spotter&quot; or the &quot;observer&quot; should be present. The spotter&#x27;s job is to watch the skier and inform the driver if the skier falls. The spotter usually sits in a chair on the boat facing backwards to see the skier. The skier and the boat&#x27;s occupants communicate using hand signals (see the Safety section below).

==Equipment==
===Water===

Water skiing can take place on any type of water – such as a river, lake, or ocean – but calmer waters are ideal for recreational skiing. There should be a skiing space and the water should be at least deep. There must be enough space for the water skier to safely &quot;get up&quot;, or successfully be in the upright skiing position. Skiers and their boat drivers must also have sufficient room to avoid hazards.Most Competitive skiers ski on man made ski lakes. The first was in Barstow, California, built by Jack Horton in 1969. The Second built by famed water ski magnate Herb O&#x27;Brien was built in 1972 in Redmond Washington. Today there are over 384 Man made ski lakes in the US.

===Skis===

Younger skiers generally start out on children&#x27;s skis, which consist of two skis tied together at their back and front. These connections mean that less strength is necessary for the child to keep the skis together. Sometimes these skis can come with a handle to help balance the skier as well. Children&#x27;s skis are short – usually long – reflecting the skier&#x27;s smaller size. Once a person is strong enough to hold the skis together themselves there are various options depending upon their skill level and weight.

Water skiers can use two skis (one on each foot, also called &quot;combo skiing&quot;) or one ski (dominant foot in front of the other foot, also called &quot;slalom skiing&quot;). Generally the heavier the person, the bigger the skis will be. Length will also vary based on the type of water skiing being performed; jump skis, for example, are longer than skis used in regular straight-line recreational skiing or competitive slalom and trick skiing. A trick ski is around 40 inches long and wider than combo skis. Again the skier rides it with his or her dominant foot in front. It has no fins which allows for spins to be performed.

Modern water skis have evolved from wooden barrels and snow skis to sophisticated composites of thermoplastics, aluminum, Kevlar, and carbon fiber. These materials make the skis not only high-performing but also sustainable, as manufacturers now use recycled materials to reduce waste and environmental impact. The incorporation of these advanced materials has led to skis that are incredibly strong, lightweight, and flexible, enhancing both performance and durability. Classic water skis are approximately 1.7 meters (5.5 feet) long and 15 centimeters (6 inches) wide, equipped with a stabilizing fin and rubber foot bindings for safety during falls. In contrast, skis used for trick or figure waterskiing are shorter, lack fins for complete rotation capability.

===Boat===
Competition skiing uses specifically designed towboats. Most towboats have a very small hull and a flat bottom to minimize wake. A true tournament ski boat will have a direct drive motor shaft that centers the weight in the boat for an optimal wake shape. However, some recreational ski boats will have the motor placed in the back of the boat (v-drive), which creates a bigger wake. Permitted towboats used for tournament water skiing are the MasterCraft ProStar 197, MasterCraft ProStar 190, Ski Nautique 200, Malibu Response TXi, and Centurion Carbon Pro. These boats have ability to pull skiers for trick skiing, jumping, and slalom.

Recreational boats can serve as water skiing platforms as well as other purposes such as cruising and fishing. Popular boat types include bowriders, deckboats, cuddy cabins, and jetboats.

The towboat must be capable of maintaining the proper speed. Speeds vary with the skier&#x27;s weight, experience level, comfort level, and type of skiing. For example, a child on two skis would require speeds of , whereas an adult on one ski might require as high as . Barefoot skiing requires speeds of approximately . Competition speeds have a wide range: as slow as up to for slalom water skiing, and approaching in water ski racing.

The boat must be equipped with a ski rope and handle. The tow rope must be sufficiently long for maneuvering, with a recommended length of (within tolerance) although length varies widely depending on the type of water skiing and the skier&#x27;s skill level. Competition requirements on rope construction have changed over the years, from &quot;quarter-inch polypropylene rope&quot; in 1992 to the 2003 flexibility as long as the same specification is used &quot;for the entire event.&quot; The handle width and diameter sizes are based on skier preference, and the handle grip is a tough rubber material. Skiers will often wear gloves to assist in holding the handle at the higher speeds as well as keep from hurting their hands. The rope and handle are anchored to the boat and played out at the stern. This anchor point on a recreation boat is commonly a tow ring or cleat, mounted on the boat&#x27;s stern. For more dedicated skiers, a metal ski pylon is placed in the center of the boat in front of the engine to connect the skier. This pylon must be mounted securely, since a skilled slalom skier can put a considerable amount of tension on the ski rope and the pylon.

==Safety measures==
As water skiing is a potentially dangerous sport, safety is important.

There should be a wide skiing space and the water should be at least deep. The towboat should stay at least from docks, swim areas, and the shore, and other boats should steer clear of skiers by at least 100 feet. Without proper space and visibility skiing can be extremely dangerous. Skiers should wear a life jacket regardless of swimming ability, although the expectation that all skiers are also competent swimmers is advisable as well. Specially-designed life jackets or ski vests allow movement needed for the sport while still providing floatation for a downed or injured skier. The most common water ski injuries involve the lower legs, such as the knee, because a fall at high speed can create irregular angles of collision between the skier&#x27;s body and the water surface. Another common cause of injury is colliding with objects on or near the water, like docks.

The tow boat must contain at least two people: a driver and an observer. In most locales, the observer will need to be at least 12 years of age. The driver maintains a steady course, free of obstacles to the skier. The observer continually observes the skier, relays the condition of the skier to the boat driver, and if necessary, raises the &quot;skier down&quot; warning flag, as required, when a skier is in the water, returning to the boat, or in some localities, the entire time the skier is out of the boat. The skier and observer should agree on a set of standard hand-signals for easy communication: stop, speed up, turn, I&#x27;m OK, skier in the water, etc.

==History==
Water skiing was invented in 1922 when Ralph Samuelson used a pair of boards as skis and a clothesline as a towrope on Lake Pepin in Lake City, Minnesota. Samuelson experimented with different positions on the skis for several days until 2 July 1923. Samuelson discovered that leaning backwards in the water with ski tips up and poking out of the water at the tip was the optimal method. His brother Ben towed him and they reached a speed of . Samuelson spent 15 years performing shows and teaching water skiing to people in the United States.

Samuelson went through several iterations of equipment in his quest to ski on water. His first equipment consisted of barrel staves for skis. He later tried snow skis, but finally fabricated his own design out of lumber with bindings made of strips of leather. The ski rope was made from a long window sash cord. Samuelson never patented any of his ski equipment.

The first patent for water skis was issued to Fred Waller, of Huntington, NY, on 27 October 1925, for skis he developed independently and marketed as &quot;Dolphin Akwa-Skees.&quot; Waller&#x27;s skis were constructed of kiln-dried mahogany, as were some boats at that time. Jack Andresen patented the first trick ski, a shorter, fin-less water ski, in 1940.

In 1928, Don Ibsen developed his own water skis out in Bellevue, Washington, never having heard of Samuelson or Waller. In 1941, Don Ibsen founded The Olympic Water Ski Club in Seattle, Washington. It was the first such club in America. Ibsen, a showman and entrepreneur, was one of the earliest manufacturers of water skis and was a leading enthusiast and promoter of the sport. In 1983, he was inducted into the Water Ski Hall of Fame in Winter Haven, Florida.

The sport of water skiing remained an obscure activity for several years after 1922, until Samuelson performed water ski shows from Michigan to Florida. The American Water Ski Association formally acknowledged Samuelson in 1966 as the first recorded water skier in history. Samuelson was also the first ski racer, slalom skier, and the first organizer of a water ski show.

Parallel to this, an avid sailor, sportsman and early adopter of water skiing, the young Swedish engineer Gunnar Ljungström (1905–1999) pioneered water skiing in slalom moves from 1929. A demonstrating behind a motorboat was made to the Swedish public at the 100th anniversary of the Royal Swedish Yacht Club in Sandhamn outside Stockholm in 1930.

Water skiing gained international attention in the hands of famed promoter, Dick Pope, Sr., often referred to as the &quot;Father of American Water Skiing&quot; and founder of Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven, Florida. Pope cultivated a distinct image for his theme-park, which included countless photographs of the water skiers featured at the park. These photographs began appearing in magazines worldwide in the 1940s and 1950s, helping to bring international attention to the sport for the first time. He was also the first person to complete a jump on water skis, jumping over a wooden ramp in 1928, for a distance of 25 feet. His son, Dick Pope, Jr., is the inventor of bare-foot skiing. Both men are in the Water Ski Hall of Fame. Today, Winter Haven, Florida, with its famous Chain of Lakes, remains an important city for water skiing, with several major ski schools operating there.

Water skiing has developed over time. Water skiing tournaments and water skiing competitions have been organized. As an exhibition sport, water skiing was included in the 1972 Olympics. The first National Show Ski Tournament was held in 1974, and the first ever National Intercollegiate Water Ski Championships were held in 1979. The Home CARE US National Water Ski Challenge, the first competition for people with disabilities, was organized ten years later.

The first patented design of a water ski which included carbon fiber was that of Hani Audah at SPORT labs in 2001. Its first inclusion in tournament slalom skiing was in 2003.

==Disciplines==
===3-event tournament water skiing===
In the United States, there are over 900 sanctioned water ski competitions each summer. Orlando, Florida is considered to be the competitive 3-event waterskiing capital of the world. Competitive water skiing consists of three events: slalom, jump, and trick.

====Slalom====

In an attempt to become as agile as possible, slalom water skiers use only one ski with feet oriented forward, one in front of the other. Slalom skis are narrow and long, at depending on the height and weight of the skier. The two forward-facing bindings vary: they can be made of rubber or thick plastic, and they can be designed more like a snow ski binding or more like a roller blade boot.

Slalom skiing involves a multi-buoy course that the skier must go around in order to complete the pass. A complete slalom water ski course consists of 26 buoys. There are entrance gates at the beginning and end of the course that the skier must go between, and there are 6 turn buoys that the skier must navigate around in a zigzag pattern. The remainder of the buoys are for the driver to ensure the boat goes straight down the center of the course. For a tournament to be sanctioned as &#x27;record capable&#x27; by the International Waterski &amp; Wakeboard Federation (IWWF), the entire course must be surveyed prior to competition by a land surveyor to ensure its accuracy. The drivers boat path must be verified as well to ensure that all skiers are getting a fair pull.

Every consecutive pass is harder than the pass before it. When a pass is completed, the boat is sped up by or the rope is shortened by specific increments. The rope is usually not shortened until the maximum speed has been reached for the division, based on the skier&#x27;s gender and age ( for women and for men). In a tournament, the boat speeds up or the rope shortens until the skier fails to complete the slalom course by falling, not getting around a buoy, or missing an entrance or exit gate.

A skier&#x27;s score is based upon the number of successful buoys cleared, the speed of the boat, and the length of the rope. In a tournament, skiers choose the starting boat speed and rope length (with a maximum length of ). Professional water skiers will typically start at the max speed of with a rope that has already been shortened to . The skier with the most buoys wins the competition.

The turn buoys are positioned away from the center of the slalom course. As the rope is shortened beyond that, the skiers are required to use the momentum generated through their turns to swing up on the side of the boat and reach out in order to get their ski around the next buoy. At these rope lengths, the skier&#x27;s body is experiencing intense isometric contractions and extreme upper body torque with loads of up to 600 kg as they begin accelerating after rounding a turn buoy. Their top speeds will generally be more than double the boat&#x27;s speed, which means that the Pro men can reach speeds in excess of and each turn will generally generate around 4 g of force. Essentially, slalom water skiers are using their body as a lever, which allows them to withstand loads that would otherwise not be possible for the human body.

====Jump====
Water ski jumpers use two long skis to ride over a water ski jump in an attempt to travel the longest distance. In a tournament, skiers are given three attempts to hit the ramp. The winner is the skier who travels the farthest calculated distance and successfully rides away. There are no style points, simply distance.

Water ski jumps have specific dimensions and the ramp height is adjustable. Skiers may choose their boat speed and ramp height, although there are maximums based the skier&#x27;s gender and age. Professional ski jumpers have a maximum boat speed of . The ramp height must be between . As a professional jumper approaches the ramp they will zigzag behind the boat in a series of cuts to generate speed and angle. When the jumper hits the ramp they will generally be going over and the load they have generated on the rope can be over .

====Trick====

The Trick competition has been described as the most technical of the three classic water skiing events.

Trick skiing uses small, oval-shaped or oblong water skis. Beginners generally use two skis while more advanced skiers use one. The shorter, wider Trick ski has a front binding facing forward and a back binding facing at a 45°. It has a smooth bottom that allows it to turn over the surface of the water. According to official 2013 Tournament Rules for 3-event competition in the United States and the Pan-Am Games, skis used in the Tricks event must be a single ski without fins, although molded rails/grooves less than are allowed, as are a foot pad cemented to the ski as a place for the rear foot; in addition, the ski must float with all bindings, fins, etc., installed. The ski&#x27;s configuration allows the skier to perform both surface and air tricks in quick succession.

In a tournament, skiers are given two 20-second runs during which they perform a series of their chosen tricks. In most cases, one pass is for hand tricks, which includes surface turns, rotations over the wake, and flips. The second pass is for toe tricks, which are done by doing wake turns and rotations with only a foot attaching them to the handle; the foot is either in the toehold part of the handle or, professionally, attached to the rope. The toehold part of the handle does not allow the skier to let go of the handle if they lose their balance and fall into the water, therefore a person in the boat is required to release the rope from the boat using a quick release mechanism installed on the ski pylon. A trick cannot be repeated. Each trick has a point value. A panel of five judges assesses which tricks were completed correctly and assigns that predetermined point value to each successfully completed trick. The skier with the most points wins.

===Barefoot water skiing===
A barefoot water skier should use a wetsuit instead of a life jacket because the wetsuit covers more of the body in case of a fall at high speed. The wetsuit also allows the skier to do starts in the water where they lie on their back. Unlike a normal life jacket, the &quot;barefoot wetsuit&quot; allows the skier to glide on their back on top of the water once they reach a high enough speed. The barefoot wetsuit is generally thicker in the back, rear, and chest for flotation and impact absorption.

Barefoot skiing requires a higher speed because the skier&#x27;s feet are smaller than skis, providing less lift. A rule of thumb for barefoot water skiing speed in miles per hour is (M/10)+18=S, where M equals the skier&#x27;s weight in pounds. In other words, a person would have to divide 175/10, which is 17.5; then simply add 17.5+18 which equals .

Another tool used in barefoot water skiing is the barefoot boom. It provides a stable aluminum bar on the side of the boat where a short rope can be attached or the skier can grip the bar itself. The skier is within earshot of the people in the boat, providing a good platform for teaching. Once the bare footer is good enough, he/she will go behind the boat with a long rope.

A beginner can wear shoes to decrease the necessary speed, lessen foot injury from choppy water, learn better technique, and master the sport.

===Show skiing===

Show skiing is a type of water skiing where skiers perform tricks somewhat similar to those of gymnasts while being pulled by the boat. Traditional ski show acts include pyramids, ski doubles, freestyle jumping, and swivel skiing. Show skiing is normally performed in water ski shows, with elaborate costumes, choreography, music, and an announcer. Show teams may also compete regionally or nationally. In the US, each team member must be a member of USA Water Ski to compete.

The first organized show occurred in 1928. The bi-annual World Show Ski Championship was inaugurated in September 2012 in Janesville, Wisconsin. Past competition included teams from Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, and the United States.

===Freestyle jumping===
Freestyle jumping is often related to show skiing. The goal is to go off the jump, perform one of many stunts, and successfully land back on the water. The most common freestyle stunts – in order of usual progression – would be a heli (360°), a flip (forwards), a gainer (a back flip), and a möbius (back flip with 360°).

===Ski racing===

Water ski racing consists of 1 or 2 skiers per boat who race around a set course behind boats set up for this type of event. It can occur in a &#x27;circle&#x27; or lap format type racing or on river courses offering longer distances and higher speeds. Races can be timed events such as 20 minute races and up to 1 hour or on courses where race distance can be over 100 km in length.

Speeds vary by classes but can reach up to 200 km/h. Boats can be inboards or outboards and are generally between 19 and 21 feet in length. Outboards are commonly 300HP and Inboards around 1,300HP (majority are turbocharged).

Current format world championship racing involves men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s open (unrestricted), and men&#x27;s and women formula 2 (limited to single rig, 300 hp outboards, as well as junior classes for under 17&#x27;s. The World Championships are held every 2 years with the most recent being 2019 in Vichy, France.

Major events include the Southern 80 (Echuca Victoria Australia), the Diamond Race (Viersel Belgium), the Catalina ski race (Long Beach CA United States), and the Bridge to Bridge (Sydney Australia). Races can have anywhere from 10 boats to 150 boats competing (grouped by engine size and age classes).

===Disabled===

Disabled water skiing uses equipment or other adaptations to allow disabled people to compete in standard 3 event skiing. Seated water skis, special handles, audio slalom gear, and other adaptations are all used for different disabilities.

==Criticism==
While water skiing is very popular, it is not universally liked. The fast, powerful boats create noise, cause waves which can cause beach erosion, and sometimes hit swimmers, other boats, or marine life. People operating boats may drink alcohol, which increases the chance of accidents. Water skiing is also criticized for air pollution from the boats&#x27; engines, and the unnecessary use of fuel (usually gasoline) and the consequent impact to climate change.

<text>Eric Arthur Heiden (born June 14, 1958) is an American physician and a former long track speed skater, road cyclist and track cyclist. He won an unprecedented five individual gold medals, and set four Olympic records and one world record at the 1980 Winter Olympics. Heiden was the most successful athlete at those Olympic Games, single-handedly winning more gold medals than all nations except for the Soviet Union (10) and East Germany (9). He is the most successful Winter Olympian from a single edition of any Winter Olympics. He delivered the Athlete&#x27;s Oath at those same 1980 Games. His coach was Dianne Holum.

Heiden is an icon in the speed skating community. His victories are significant, as few speed skaters (and athletes in general) have won competitions in both sprint and long-distance events. Heiden is the only athlete in the history of speed skating to have won all five events in a single Olympic tournament and the only one to have won a gold medal in all events. He is considered by some to be the best overall speed skater (short and long distances) in the sport&#x27;s history. Heiden ranked No. 46 in &quot;ESPN&#x27;s SportsCentury 50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century&quot; in 1999, the only speed skater to make the list. In 2000, a Dutch newspaper called him the greatest skater ever.

==Early life, education and family==
Heiden was born in Madison, Wisconsin on June 14, 1958. His father, Jack Heiden, was a longtime orthopedic surgeon in Madison. His sister, Beth Heiden, also became an accomplished cyclist, speed skater and cross-country skier. In their hometown Shorewood Hills, Wisconsin (a suburb of Madison), Eric and his sister Beth were the driving forces behind the creation of the Heiden Haus, a small outpost where local children can warm up after skating or playing hockey on the ice rink (complete with underground clay platform). He graduated from Madison West High School in 1976.

After starting his undergraduate education at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Heiden transferred to the University of California, San Diego and then to Stanford University in California, earning a B.S. degree in 1984 and an M.D. degree in 1991.

== Athletic career ==
===Speed skating===
Heiden won the World Junior Speed Skating Championships in 1977 and 1978. During his short speed skating career, Heiden won three World Allround Championships and four World Sprint Championships, becoming the youngest athlete to do so. Three times he broke the world record in the 1000 metres, twice in the 3000 metres, and once each in the 1500 metres and 10000 metres. He also broke the points world record in both allround and the sprinting distances.

Heiden finished his speed skating career by finishing second behind Hilbert van der Duim at the 1980 World Allround Championships in Heerenveen. He stood at the top of the Adelskalender, a ranking system for long-track speed skating, for a record 1,495 days, and he won the Oscar Mathisen Award four times in a row from 1977 until 1980. As of 2025, he still is the only skater who has won the award four times.

He received the 1980 James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States. In 1983, he was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame.

Heiden was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1990.

==== World records ====


Over the course of Heiden&#x27;s career he skated 15 world records:

===Cycling===
After his speed-skating career Heiden became a professional cyclist.

====Track cycling====
As a track cyclist Heiden competed at the 1981 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Brno, but was not successful. He finished 19th and last in the men&#x27;s individual pursuit event.

==== Road bicycle racing ====
Heiden became a professional racing cyclist. He was one of the first cross-over athletes, becoming a founding member of the 7-Eleven Cycling Team. Together with his former speed skating coach (and ex-bike racer), Jim Ochowicz, he conceived of the idea of a European-style sponsored team for North American riders Heiden won a few American professional races. He finished the 1985 Giro d&#x27;Italia and took part in the 1986 Tour de France, although he did not complete the race, crashing on a downhill stretch and suffering a concussion five days from the finish.

Heiden is believed to have recorded one of the fastest times at 14:10 (1986 or 1987) on one of the local benchmark climbs in Woodside, California: Old La Honda Road. In 1985, Heiden won the first U.S. Professional Cycling Championship, becoming the American road race champion.

In 1999, Heiden was inducted into the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame.

== Medical career ==
Heiden completed medical school at Stanford University in 1991, and orthopedic residency training at University of California, Davis, in 1996, then spent a year at a sports medicine clinic in Birmingham, Alabama. He returned to California to practice as an orthopedic surgeon in Sacramento. At that time, he also served as team physician for the NBA&#x27;s Sacramento Kings and the Sacramento Monarchs of the WNBA. In 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014 he was team physician for the U.S. Olympic speed skating team. He opened a sports medicine-based practice at The Orthopedic Specialty Hospital (TOSH) in Murray, Utah and expanded Heiden Orthopaedics with an additional office in Park City, Utah.

In 2008, Heiden and Massimo Testa published &quot;Faster, Better, Stronger&quot;, a book about exercise science and exercise programs.

In 2009, Heiden was one of the team of doctors assisting U.S. speed skater J.R. Celski as the latter recovered from a very bad speed skating crash during the U.S. Olympic trials. Despite cutting himself to the bone and requiring 60 stitches, Celski was able to recover in time for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, where he won the bronze medal in both men&#x27;s 1500 m and 5000 m relay.

==Personal life==
Heiden met fellow medical student Karen Drews while the two were studying at Stanford, and they married in 1995. Karen is a hand surgeon. They have a daughter, Zoe, born in 2001.

Heiden was offered many sponsorship opportunities after his record-setting performance in the 1980 Winter Olympics, but turned down most of them, saying he had enough money, and preferred the anonymity.

A number of American former gold medal winners, including Heiden, were asked to participate in the ceremonies for the 2002 Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City, Utah, but Heiden declined after he was passed over for the honor of lighting the Olympic torch. The 1980 U.S. Hockey Team, which won the gold medal at the 1980 games, was given the honor instead. Heiden said in 2009: &quot;I was probably just too stubborn. I figured if they don&#x27;t appreciate what I did as a skater, if they don&#x27;t appreciate now what I am doing as a human being, I&#x27;d just as soon hang out with my buddies and watch it. I did not mean to slight the Olympic hockey team in any way.&quot;

<doc id="38992" wikidata="Q59151" url="?curid=38992" title="Cosmological constant">
<text>In cosmology, the cosmological constant (usually denoted by the Greek capital letter lambda: ), alternatively called Einstein&#x27;s cosmological constant, 
is a coefficient that Albert Einstein initially added to his field equations of general relativity. He later removed it; however, much later it was revived to express the energy density of space, or vacuum energy, that arises in quantum mechanics. It is closely associated with the concept of dark energy.

Einstein introduced the constant in 1917 to counterbalance the effect of gravity and achieve a static universe, which was then assumed. Einstein&#x27;s cosmological constant was abandoned after Edwin Hubble confirmed that the universe was expanding. From the 1930s until the late 1990s, most physicists agreed with Einstein&#x27;s choice of setting the cosmological constant to zero. That changed with the discovery in 1998 that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, implying that the cosmological constant may have a positive value.

Since the 1990s, studies have shown that, assuming the cosmological principle, around 68% of the mass–energy density of the universe can be attributed to dark energy. The cosmological constant is the simplest possible explanation for dark energy, and is used in the standard model of cosmology known as the ΛCDM model.

According to quantum field theory (QFT), which underlies modern particle physics, empty space is defined by the vacuum state, which is composed of a collection of quantum fields. All these quantum fields exhibit fluctuations in their ground state (lowest energy density) arising from the zero-point energy existing everywhere in space. These zero-point fluctuations should contribute to the cosmological constant , but actual calculations give rise to an enormous vacuum energy. The discrepancy between theorized vacuum energy from quantum field theory and observed vacuum energy from cosmology is a source of major contention, with the values predicted exceeding observation by some 120 orders of magnitude, a discrepancy that has been called &quot;the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics!&quot;. This issue is called the cosmological constant problem and it is one of the greatest mysteries in science with many physicists believing that &quot;the vacuum holds the key to a full understanding of nature&quot;.

== History ==
The cosmological constant was originally introduced in Einstein&#x27;s 1917 paper entitled “&quot;The cosmological considerations in the General Theory of Reality&quot;”. Einstein included the cosmological constant as a term in his field equations for general relativity because he was dissatisfied that otherwise his equations did not allow for a static universe: gravity would cause a universe that was initially non-expanding to contract. To counteract this possibility, Einstein added the cosmological constant. However, Einstein was not happy about adding this cosmological term. He later stated that &quot;Since I introduced this term, I had always a bad conscience. ... I am unable to believe that such an ugly thing is actually realized in nature&quot;. Einstein&#x27;s static universe is unstable against matter density perturbations. Furthermore, without the cosmological constant Einstein could have found the expansion of the universe before Hubble&#x27;s observations.

In 1929, not long after Einstein developed his static theory, observations by Edwin Hubble indicated that the universe appears to be expanding; this was consistent with a cosmological solution to the original general relativity equations that had been found by the mathematician Alexander Friedmann, working on the Einstein equations of general relativity. Einstein reportedly referred to his failure to accept the validation of his equations—when they had predicted the expansion of the universe in theory, before it was demonstrated in observation of the cosmological redshift—as his &quot;biggest blunder&quot; (according to George Gamow).

It transpired that adding the cosmological constant to Einstein&#x27;s equations does not lead to a static universe at equilibrium because the equilibrium is unstable: if the universe expands slightly, then the expansion releases vacuum energy, which causes yet more expansion. Likewise, a universe that contracts slightly will continue contracting.

However, the cosmological constant remained a subject of theoretical and empirical interest. Empirically, the cosmological data of recent decades strongly suggest that our universe has a positive cosmological constant. The explanation of this small but positive value is a remaining theoretical challenge, the so-called cosmological constant problem.

Some early generalizations of Einstein&#x27;s gravitational theory, known as classical unified field theories, either introduced a cosmological constant on theoretical grounds or found that it arose naturally from the mathematics. For example, Arthur Eddington claimed that the cosmological constant version of the vacuum field equation expressed the &quot;epistemological&quot; property that the universe is &quot;self-gauging&quot;, and Erwin Schrödinger&#x27;s pure-affine theory using a simple variational principle produced the field equation with a cosmological term.

In 1990s, Saul Perlmutter at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Brian Schmidt of the Australian National University and Adam Riess of the Space Telescope Science Institute were searching for type Ia supernovae. At that time, they expected to observe the deceleration of the supernovae caused by gravitational attraction of mass according to Einstein&#x27;s gravitational theory. The first reports published in July 1997 from the Supernova Cosmology Project used the supernova observation to support such deceleration hypothesis. But soon they found that supernovae were accelerating away. Both teams announced this surprising result in 1998. It implied the universe is undergoing accelerating expansion. The cosmological constant is needed to explain such acceleration. Following this discovery, the cosmological constant was reinserted in the general relativity equations.

=== Sequence of events 1915–1998 ===
* In 1915, Einstein publishes his equations of general relativity, without a cosmological constant .
* In 1917, Einstein adds the parameter to his equations when he realizes that his theory implies a dynamic universe for which space is a function of time. He then gives this constant a value that makes his Universe model remain static and eternal (Einstein static universe).
* In 1922, the Russian physicist Alexander Friedmann mathematically shows that Einstein&#x27;s equations (whatever ) remain valid in a dynamic universe.
* In 1927, the Belgian astrophysicist Georges Lemaître shows that the Universe is expanding by combining general relativity with astronomical observations, those of Hubble in particular.
* In 1931, Einstein accepts the theory of an expanding universe and proposes, in 1932 with the Dutch physicist and astronomer Willem de Sitter, a model of a continuously expanding universe with zero cosmological constant (Einstein–de Sitter spacetime).
* In 1998, two teams of astrophysicists, the Supernova Cosmology Project and the High-Z Supernova Search Team, carried out measurements on distant supernovae which showed that the speed of galaxies&#x27; recession in relation to the Milky Way increases over time. The universe is in accelerated expansion, which requires having a strictly positive . The universe would contain a mysterious dark energy producing a repulsive force that counterbalances the gravitational braking produced by the matter contained in the universe (see &quot;Standard cosmological model&quot;). For this work, Perlmutter, Schmidt, and Riess jointly received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011.

== Equation ==

The cosmological constant appears in the Einstein field equations in the form
formula_1
where the Ricci tensor , Ricci scalar and the metric tensor describe the structure of spacetime, the stress–energy tensor describes the energy density, momentum density and stress at that point in spacetime, and . The gravitational constant and the speed of light are universal constants. When is zero, this reduces to the field equation of general relativity usually used in the 20th century. When is zero, the field equation describes empty space (a vacuum).

The cosmological constant has the same effect as an intrinsic energy density of the vacuum, &quot;&quot; (and an associated pressure). In this context, it is commonly moved to the right-hand side of the equation using . It is common to quote values of energy density directly, though still using the name &quot;cosmological constant&quot;. The dimension of is generally understood as length.

Using the Planck units, and the value evaluated in 2025 for the Hubble constant &quot;&quot;0 = = , has the value of formula_2 where formula_3 is the Planck length. A positive vacuum energy density resulting from a cosmological constant implies a negative pressure, and vice versa. If the energy density is positive, the associated negative pressure will drive an accelerated expansion of the universe, as observed. (See &quot;Dark energy&quot; and &quot;Cosmic inflation&quot; for details.)

=== Density parameter Ω ===
The dimensionless density parameter Ω represents the ratio of the actual density of a component of the universe to the critical density. The total density parameter for a flat universe (concluded by WMAP), can be expressed as:

formula_4

Where:

* Ω&quot;m&quot; is the matter density parameter (including both baryonic and dark matter);

* ΩΛ is the density parameter for dark energy (cosmological constant); and

* Ω&quot;k&quot; describes the curvature of the universe which is 0 in a flat universe.

Instead of the cosmological constant itself, cosmologists often refer to the ratio between the energy density due to the cosmological constant and the critical density of the universe, the tipping point for a sufficient density to stop the universe from expanding forever (the dark energy density parameter). This ratio is estimated to be 0.714, according to results published by the Planck Collaboration in 2018 and clearly mentioned on WMAP. More intuitively, this parameter could be described as the fraction of the universe that is made up of dark energy. Note that this value changes over time: The critical density changes with cosmological time but the energy density due to the cosmological constant remains unchanged throughout the history of the universe, because the amount of dark energy increases as the universe grows but the amount of matter does not.

=== Equation of state ===
Another ratio that is used by scientists is the equation of state, usually denoted , which is the ratio of pressure that dark energy puts on the universe to the energy per unit volume. This ratio is for the cosmological constant used in the Einstein equations; alternative time-varying forms of vacuum energy such as quintessence generally use a different value. The value = , measured by the Planck Collaboration (2018) is consistent with , assuming does not change over cosmic time.

== Positive value ==

Observations announced in 1998 of distance–redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, if one assumes the cosmological principle. When combined with measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation these implied a value of ≈ 0.7, a result which has been supported and refined by more recent measurements (as well as previous works). If one assumes the cosmological principle, as in the case for all models that use the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric, while there are other possible causes of an accelerating universe, such as quintessence, the cosmological constant is in most respects the simplest solution. Thus, the Lambda-CDM model, the current standard model of cosmology which uses the FLRW metric, includes the cosmological constant, which is measured to be on the order of . It may be expressed as (multiplying by ) or as 10−122 &quot;ℓ&quot;−2 (where &quot;ℓ&quot; is the Planck length). The value is based on recent measurements of vacuum energy density, = ≘ = . However, due to the Hubble tension and the CMB dipole, recently it has been proposed that the cosmological principle is no longer true in the late universe and that the FLRW metric breaks down, so it is possible that observations usually attributed to an accelerating universe are simply a result of the cosmological principle not applying in the late universe.

As was only recently seen, by works of &#x27;t Hooft, Susskind and others, a positive cosmological constant has surprising consequences, such as a finite maximum entropy of the observable universe (see &quot;Holographic principle&quot;).

A major outstanding problem is that most quantum field theories predict a huge value for the quantum vacuum. A common assumption is that the quantum vacuum is equivalent to the cosmological constant. Although no theory exists that supports this assumption, arguments can be made in its favor.

Such arguments are usually based on dimensional analysis and effective field theory. If the universe is described by an effective local quantum field theory down to the Planck scale, then we would expect a cosmological constant of the order of formula_5 (formula_6 in reduced Planck units). As noted above, the measured cosmological constant is smaller than this by a factor of ~10120. This discrepancy has been called &quot;the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics&quot;.

Some supersymmetric theories require a cosmological constant that is exactly zero, which further complicates things. This is the cosmological constant problem, the worst problem of fine-tuning in physics: there is no known natural way to derive the tiny cosmological constant used in cosmology from particle physics.

No vacuum in the string theory landscape is known to support a metastable, positive cosmological constant, and in 2018 a group of four physicists advanced a controversial conjecture which would imply that no such universe exists.

=== Anthropic principle ===
One possible explanation for the small but non-zero value was noted by Steven Weinberg in 1987 following the anthropic principle. Weinberg explains that if the vacuum energy took different values in different domains of the universe, then observers would necessarily measure values similar to that which is observed: the formation of life-supporting structures would be suppressed in domains where the vacuum energy is much larger. Specifically, if the vacuum energy is negative and its absolute value is substantially larger than it appears to be in the observed universe (say, a factor of 10 larger), holding all other variables (e.g. matter density) constant, that would mean that the universe is closed; furthermore, its lifetime would be shorter than the age of our universe, possibly too short for intelligent life to form. On the other hand, a universe with a large positive cosmological constant would expand too fast, preventing galaxy formation. According to Weinberg, domains where the vacuum energy is compatible with life would be comparatively rare. Using this argument, Weinberg predicted that the cosmological constant would have a value of less than a hundred times the currently accepted value. In 1992, Weinberg refined this prediction of the cosmological constant to 5 to 10 times the matter density.

This argument depends on the vacuum energy density being constant throughout spacetime, as would be expected if dark energy were the cosmological constant. There is no evidence that the vacuum energy does vary, but it may be the case if, for example, the vacuum energy is (even in part) the potential of a scalar field such as the residual inflaton (also see &quot;Quintessence&quot;). Another theoretical approach that deals with the issue is that of multiverse theories, which predict a large number of &quot;parallel&quot; universes with different laws of physics and/or values of fundamental constants. Again, the anthropic principle states that we can only live in one of the universes that is compatible with some form of intelligent life. Critics claim that these theories, when used as an explanation for fine-tuning, commit the inverse gambler&#x27;s fallacy.

In 1995, Weinberg&#x27;s argument was refined by Alexander Vilenkin to predict a value for the cosmological constant that was only ten times the matter density, i.e. about three times the current value since determined.

=== Failure to detect dark energy ===
An attempt to directly observe and relate quanta or fields like the chameleon particle or the symmetron theory to dark energy, in a laboratory setting, failed to detect a new force. Inferring the presence of dark energy through its interaction with baryons in the cosmic microwave background has also led to a negative result, although the current analyses have been derived only at the linear perturbation regime. It is also possible that the difficulty in detecting dark energy is due to the fact that the cosmological constant describes an existing, known interaction (e.g. electromagnetic field).

<text>In physics, optical depth or optical thickness is the natural logarithm of the ratio of incident to &quot;transmitted&quot; radiant power through a material.
Thus, the larger the optical depth, the smaller the amount of transmitted radiant power through the material. 
Spectral optical depth or spectral optical thickness is the natural logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted spectral radiant power through a material. Optical depth is dimensionless, and in particular is not a length, though it is a monotonically increasing function of optical path length, and approaches zero as the path length approaches zero. The use of the term &quot;optical density&quot; for optical depth is discouraged.

In chemistry, a closely related quantity called &quot;absorbance&quot; or &quot;decadic absorbance&quot; is used instead of optical depth: the common logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted radiant power through a material. It is the optical depth divided by , because of the different logarithm bases used.

== Mathematical definitions ==
=== Optical depth ===
The optical depth of a material, denoted formula_1, is given by:formula_2where
* formula_3 is the radiant flux received by that material;
* formula_4 is the radiant flux transmitted by that material;
* formula_5 is the transmittance of that material.

The absorbance formula_6 is related to optical depth by:formula_7

=== Spectral optical depth ===
The spectral optical depth in frequency (denoted formula_8) or in wavelength (formula_9) of a material is given by:
formula_10formula_11
where
* formula_12 is the spectral radiant flux in frequency transmitted by that material;
* formula_13 is the spectral radiant flux in frequency received by that material;
* formula_14 is the spectral transmittance in frequency of that material;
* formula_15 is the spectral radiant flux in wavelength transmitted by that material;
* formula_16 is the spectral radiant flux in wavelength received by that material;
* formula_17 is the spectral transmittance in wavelength of that material.

Spectral absorbance is related to spectral optical depth by:
formula_18formula_19
where
* formula_20 is the spectral absorbance in frequency;
* formula_21 is the spectral absorbance in wavelength.

== Relationship with attenuation ==

=== Attenuation ===

Optical depth measures the attenuation of the transmitted radiant power in a material. Attenuation can be caused by absorption, but also reflection, scattering, and other physical processes. Optical depth of a material is approximately equal to its attenuation when both the absorbance is much less than 1 and the emittance of that material (not to be confused with radiant exitance or emissivity) is much less than the optical depth:
formula_22formula_23
where
* Φet is the radiant power transmitted by that material;
* Φeatt is the radiant power attenuated by that material;
* Φei is the radiant power received by that material;
* Φee is the radiant power emitted by that material;
* &quot;T&quot; = Φet/Φei is the transmittance of that material;
* &quot;ATT&quot; = Φeatt/Φei is the attenuation of that material;
* &quot;E&quot; = Φee/Φei is the emittance of that material,
and according to the Beer–Lambert law,
formula_24so:formula_25

=== Attenuation coefficient ===
Optical depth of a material is also related to its attenuation coefficient by:formula_26where
* &quot;l&quot; is the thickness of that material through which the light travels;
* &quot;α&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is the attenuation coefficient or Napierian attenuation coefficient of that material at &quot;z&quot;,
and if &quot;α&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is uniform along the path, the attenuation is said to be a linear attenuation and the relation becomes: formula_27

Sometimes the relation is given using the attenuation cross section of the material, that is its attenuation coefficient divided by its number density:formula_28 where
* &quot;σ&quot; is the attenuation cross section of that material;
* &quot;n&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is the number density of that material at &quot;z&quot;,
and if formula_29 is uniform along the path, i.e., formula_30, the relation becomes:formula_31

== Applications ==

=== Atomic physics ===
In atomic physics, the spectral optical depth of a cloud of atoms can be calculated from the quantum-mechanical properties of the atoms. It is given byformula_32where
* &quot;d&quot; is the transition dipole moment;
* &quot;n&quot; is the number of atoms;
* &quot;ν&quot; is the frequency of the beam;
* &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light;
* &quot;ħ&quot; is the reduced Planck constant;
* &quot;ε&quot;0 is the vacuum permittivity;
* &quot;σ&quot; is the cross section of the beam;
* &quot;γ&quot; is the natural linewidth of the transition.

===Atmospheric sciences===

In atmospheric sciences, one often refers to the optical depth of the atmosphere as corresponding to the vertical path from Earth&#x27;s surface to outer space; at other times the optical path is from the observer&#x27;s altitude to outer space. The optical depth for a slant path is , where &quot;τ′&quot; refers to a vertical path, &quot;m&quot; is called the relative airmass, and for a plane-parallel atmosphere it is determined as where &quot;θ&quot; is the zenith angle corresponding to the given path. Therefore,formula_33The optical depth of the atmosphere can be divided into several components, ascribed to Rayleigh scattering, aerosols, and gaseous absorption. The optical depth of the atmosphere can be measured with a Sun photometer.

The optical depth with respect to the height within the atmosphere is given by
formula_34
and it follows that the total atmospheric optical depth is given by
formula_35

In both equations:
* &quot;k&quot;a is the absorption coefficient
* &quot;w&quot;1 is the mixing ratio
* &quot;ρ&quot;0 is the density of air at sea level
* &quot;H&quot; is the scale height of the atmosphere
* &quot;z&quot; is the height in question

The optical depth of a plane parallel cloud layer is given byformula_36where:
* &quot;Q&quot;e is the extinction efficiency
* &quot;L&quot; is the liquid water path
* &quot;H&quot; is the geometrical thickness
* &quot;N&quot; is the concentration of droplets
* &quot;ρ&quot;l is the density of liquid water

So, with a fixed depth and total liquid water path, formula_37.

=== Astronomy ===

In astronomy, the photosphere of a star is defined as the surface where its optical depth is 2/3. This means that each photon emitted at the photosphere suffers an average of less than one scattering before it reaches the observer. At the temperature at optical depth 2/3, the energy emitted by the star (the original derivation is for the Sun) matches the observed total energy emitted.

Note that the optical depth of a given medium will be different for different colors (wavelengths) of light.

For planetary rings, the optical depth is the (negative logarithm of the) proportion of light blocked by the ring when it lies between the source and the observer. This is usually obtained by observation of stellar occultations.

<doc id="38998" wikidata="Q188631" url="?curid=38998" title="Vulcanization">
<text>Vulcanization (British English: vulcanisation) is a range of processes for hardening rubbers. The term originally referred exclusively to the treatment of natural rubber with sulfur, which remains the most common practice. It has also grown to include the hardening of other (synthetic) rubbers via various means. Examples include silicone rubber via room temperature vulcanizing and chloroprene rubber (neoprene) using metal oxides. 

Vulcanization can be defined as the curing of elastomers, with the terms &#x27;vulcanization&#x27; and &#x27;curing&#x27; sometimes used interchangeably in this context. It works by forming cross-links between sections of the polymer chain which results in increased rigidity and durability, as well as other changes in the mechanical and electrical properties of the material. Vulcanization, in common with the curing of other thermosetting polymers, is generally irreversible.

The word was suggested by William Brockedon (a friend of Thomas Hancock who attained the British patent for the process) coming from the god Vulcan who was associated with heat and sulfur in volcanoes.

==History==

In ancient Mesoamerican cultures, rubber was used to make balls, sandal soles, elastic bands, and waterproof containers. It was cured using sulfur-rich plant juices, an early form of vulcanization.

In the 1830s, Charles Goodyear worked to devise a process for strengthening rubber tires. Tires of the time would become soft and sticky with heat, accumulating road debris that punctured them. Goodyear tried heating rubber in order to mix other chemicals with it. This seemed to harden and improve the rubber, though this was due to the heating itself and not the chemicals used. Not realizing this, he repeatedly ran into setbacks when his announced hardening formulas did not work consistently. One day in 1839, when trying to mix rubber with sulfur, Goodyear accidentally dropped the mixture in a hot frying pan. To his astonishment, instead of melting further or vaporizing, the rubber remained firm and, as he increased the heat, the rubber became harder. Goodyear worked out a consistent system for this hardening, and by 1844 patented the process and was producing the rubber on an industrial scale.

==Applications==
There are many uses for vulcanized materials, some examples of which are rubber hoses, shoe soles, toys, erasers, hockey pucks, shock absorbers, conveyor belts, vibration mounts/dampers, insulation materials, tires, and bowling balls. Most rubber products are vulcanized as this greatly improves their lifespan, function, and strength.

==Overview==
In contrast with thermoplastic processes (the melt-freeze process that characterize the behaviour of most modern polymers), vulcanization, in common with the curing of other thermosetting polymers, is generally irreversible.
Five types of curing systems are in common use:

# Sulfur systems
# Peroxides
# Metallic oxides
# Acetoxysilane
# Urethane crosslinkers

==Vulcanization with sulfur==
The most common vulcanizing methods depend on sulfur. Sulfur, by itself, is a slow vulcanizing agent and does not vulcanize synthetic polyolefins. Accelerated vulcanization is carried out using various compounds that modify the kinetics of crosslinking; this mixture is often referred to as a cure package. The main polymers subjected to sulfur vulcanization are polyisoprene (natural rubber) and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), which are used for most street-vehicle tires. The cure package is adjusted specifically for the substrate and the application. The reactive sites—cure sites—are allylic hydrogen atoms. These C-H bonds are adjacent to carbon-carbon double bonds (&gt;C=C&lt;). During vulcanization, some of these C-H bonds are replaced by chains of sulfur atoms that link with a cure site of another polymer chain. These bridges contain between one and several atoms. The number of sulfur atoms in the crosslink strongly influences the physical properties of the final rubber article. Short crosslinks give the rubber better heat resistance. Crosslinks with higher number of sulfur atoms give the rubber good dynamic properties but less heat resistance. Dynamic properties are important for flexing movements of the rubber article, e.g., the movement of a side-wall of a running tire. Without good flexing properties these movements rapidly form cracks, and ultimately will make the rubber article fail.

==Vulcanization of polychloroprene==
The vulcanization of neoprene or polychloroprene rubber (CR rubber) is carried out using metal oxides (specifically MgO and ZnO, sometimes Pb3O4) rather than sulfur compounds which are presently used with many natural and synthetic rubbers. In addition, because of various processing factors (principally scorch, this being the premature cross-linking of rubbers due to the influence of heat), the choice of accelerator is governed by different rules to other diene rubbers. Most conventionally used accelerators are problematic when CR rubbers are cured and the most important accelerant has been found to be ethylene thiourea (ETU), which, although being an excellent and proven accelerator for polychloroprene, has been classified as reprotoxic. From 2010 to 2013, the European rubber industry had a research project titled SafeRubber to develop a safer alternative to the use of ETU.

==Vulcanization of silicones==
Room-temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone is constructed of reactive oil-based polymers combined with strengthening mineral fillers. There are two types of room-temperature vulcanizing silicone:
# RTV-1 (One-component systems); hardens due to the action of atmospheric humidity, a catalyst, and acetoxysilane. Acetoxysilane, when exposed to humid conditions, will form acetic acid. The curing process begins on the outer surface and progresses through to its core. The product is packed in airtight cartridges and is either in a fluid or paste form. RTV-1 silicone has good adhesion, elasticity, and durability characteristics. The Shore hardness can be varied between 18 and 60. Elongation at break can range from 150% up to 700%. They have excellent aging resistance due to superior resistance to UV radiation and weathering.
# RTV-2 (Two-component systems); two-component products that, when mixed, cure at room-temperature to a solid elastomer, a gel, or a flexible foam. RTV-2 remains flexible from . Break-down occurs at temperatures above , leaving an inert silica deposit that is non-flammable and non-combustible. They can be used for electrical insulation due to their dielectric properties. Mechanical properties are satisfactory. RTV-2 is used to make flexible moulds, as well as many technical parts for industry and paramedical applications.

<text>Bolesław I the Brave (17 June 1025), less often known as Bolesław the Great, was Duke of Poland from 992 to 1025 and the first King of Poland in 1025. He was also Duke of Bohemia between 1003 and 1004 as Boleslaus IV. A member of the Piast dynasty, Bolesław was a capable monarch and a strong mediator in Central European affairs. He continued to proselytise Western Christianity among his subjects and raised Poland to the rank of a kingdom, thus becoming the first Polish ruler to hold the title of &quot;rex&quot;, Latin for king.

The son of Mieszko I of Poland by his first wife Dobrawa of Bohemia, Bolesław ruled Lesser Poland already during the final years of Mieszko&#x27;s reign. When the country became divided in 992, he banished his father&#x27;s widow, Oda of Haldensleben, purged his half-brothers along with their adherents and successfully reunified Poland by 995. As a devout Christian, Bolesław supported the missionary endeavours of Adalbert of Prague and Bruno of Querfurt. The martyrdom of Adalbert in 997 and Bolesław&#x27;s successful attempt to ransom the bishop&#x27;s remains, paying for their weight in gold, consolidated Poland&#x27;s autonomy from the Holy Roman Empire.

At the Congress of Gniezno (11 March 1000), Emperor Otto III permitted the establishment of a Polish church structure with a metropolitan see at Gniezno, independent from the Archbishopric of Magdeburg. Bishoprics were also established in Kraków, Wrocław, and Kołobrzeg, and Bolesław formally repudiated paying tribute to the Empire. Following Otto&#x27;s death in 1002, Bolesław fought a series of wars against Otto&#x27;s cousin and heir, Henry II, ending in the Peace of Bautzen (1018). In the summer of 1018, in one of his expeditions, Bolesław I captured Kiev, where he installed his son-in-law Sviatopolk I as ruler. According to legend, Bolesław chipped his blade when striking Kiev&#x27;s Golden Gate. In honour of this legend, the &quot;Szczerbiec&quot; (&quot;Jagged Sword&quot;) would later become the coronation sword of Polish kings.

Bolesław is widely considered one of Poland&#x27;s most accomplished Piast monarchs; he was an able strategist and , who transformed Poland into an entity comparable to a hereditary monarchy. Bolesław conducted successful military campaigns to the west, south and east of his realm, and conquered territories in modern-day Slovakia, Moravia, Red Ruthenia, Meissen, Lusatia, and Bohemia. He established the &quot;Prince&#x27;s Law&quot; and sponsored the construction of churches, monasteries, military forts as well as waterway infrastructure. He also introduced the first Polish monetary unit, the &quot;grzywna&quot;, divided into 240 denarii, and minted his own coinage.

== Early life ==
Bolesław was born in 966 or 967, the first child of Mieszko I of Poland and his wife, the Bohemian princess Dobrawa, known in Czech as Doubravka. His &quot;Epitaph&quot;, which was written in the middle of the , emphasised that Bolesław had been born to a &quot;faithless&quot; father and a &quot;true-believing&quot; mother, suggesting that he was born before his father&#x27;s baptism. Bolesław was baptised shortly after his birth. He was named after his maternal grandfather, Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia. Not much is known about Bolesław&#x27;s childhood. His &quot;Epitaph&quot; recorded that he underwent the traditional hair-cutting ceremony at the age of seven and a lock of his hair was sent to Rome. The latter act suggests that Mieszko wanted to place his son under the protection of the Holy See. Historian Tadeusz Manteuffel says that Bolesław needed that protection because his father had sent him to the court of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor in token of his allegiance to the emperor. However, historian Marek Kazimierz Barański notes that the claim that Bolesław was sent as a hostage to the imperial court is disputed.

Bolesław&#x27;s mother, Dobrawa, died in 977; his widowed father married Oda of Haldensleben who had already been a nun. Around that time, Bolesław became the ruler of Lesser Poland, through it is not exactly clear in what circumstances. Jerzy Strzelczyk says that Bolesław received Lesser Poland from his father; Tadeusz Manteuffel states that he seized the province from his father with the local lords&#x27; support; and Henryk Łowmiański writes that his uncle, Boleslav II of Bohemia, granted the region to him.

== Accession and consolidation ==


Mieszko I died on 25 May 992. The contemporaneous Thietmar of Merseburg recorded that Mieszko left &quot;his kingdom to be divided among many claimants&quot;, but Bolesław unified the country &quot;with fox-like cunning&quot; and expelled his stepmother and half-brothers from Poland. Two Polish lords Odilien and Przibiwoj, who had supported Oda and her sons, were blinded on Bolesław&#x27;s order. How long it took him to take control of all of Poland is a matter of dispute, but the consensus is within a few years.

Bolesław&#x27;s first coins were issued around 995. One of them bore the inscription Vencievlavus, showing that he regarded his mother&#x27;s uncle Duke Wenceslaus I of Bohemia as the patron saint of Poland. Bolesław sent reinforcements to the Holy Roman Empire to fight against the Polabian Slavs in summer 992. Bolesław personally led a Polish army to assist the imperial troops in invading the land of the Abodrites or Veleti in 995. During the campaign, he met the young German monarch, Otto III.

Soběslav, the head of the Bohemian Slavník dynasty, also participated in the 995 campaign. Taking advantage of Soběslav&#x27;s absence, Boleslav II of Bohemia invaded the Slavníks&#x27; domains and had most members of the family murdered. After learning of his kinsmen&#x27;s fate, Soběslav settled in Poland. Bolesław gave shelter to him &quot;for the sake of [Soběslav&#x27;s] holy brother&quot;, Bishop Adalbert of Prague, according to the latter&#x27;s hagiographies. Adalbert (known as Wojciech before his consecration) also came to Poland in 996, because Bolesław &quot;was quite amicably disposed towards him&quot;. Adalbert&#x27;s hagiographies suggest that the bishop and Bolesław closely cooperated. In early 997 Adalbert left Poland to proselytise among the Prussians, who had been invading the eastern borderlands of Bolesław&#x27;s realm. However, the pagans murdered him on 23 April 997. Bolesław ransomed Adalbert&#x27;s remains, paying its weight in gold, and buried it in Gniezno. He sent parts of the martyr bishop&#x27;s corpse to Emperor Otto III who had been Adalbert&#x27;s friend.

== Congress of Gniezno and its aftermath (999–1002) ==
Emperor Otto III held a synod in Rome where Adalbert was canonised on the emperor&#x27;s request on 29 June 999. Before 2 December 999, Adalbert&#x27;s brother, Radim Gaudentius, was consecrated &quot;Saint Adalbert&#x27;s archbishop&quot;. Otto III made a pilgrimage to Saint Adalbert&#x27;s tomb in Gniezno, accompanied by Pope Sylvester II&#x27;s legate, Robert, in early 1000. Thietmar of Merseburg mentioned that it &quot;would be impossible to believe or describe&quot; how Bolesław received the emperor and conducted him to Gniezno. A century later, Gallus Anonymus added that &quot;[m]arvelous and wonderful sights Bolesław set before the emperor when he arrived: the ranks first of the knights in all their variety, and then of the princes, lined up on a spacious plain like choirs, each separate unit set apart by the distinct and varied colors of its apparel, and no garment there was of inferior quality, but of the most precious stuff that might anywhere be found.&quot;

Bolesław took advantage of the emperor&#x27;s pilgrimage. After the Emperor&#x27;s visit in Gniezno, Poland started to develop into a sovereign state, in contrast with Bohemia, which remained a vassal state, incorporated in the Kingdom of Germany. Thietmar of Merseburg condemned Otto III for &quot;making a lord out of a tributary&quot; in reference to the relationship between the Emperor and Bolesław. Gallus Anonymus emphasised that Otto III declared Bolesław &quot;his brother and partner&quot; in the Holy Roman Empire, also calling Bolesław &quot;a friend and ally of the Roman people&quot;. The same chronicler mentioned that Otto III &quot;took the imperial diadem from his own head and laid it upon the head of Bolesław in pledge of friendship&quot; in Gniezno. Bolesław also received &quot;one of the nails from the cross of our Lord with the lance of St. Maurice&quot; from the Emperor.
Gallus Anonymus claimed that Bolesław was &quot;gloriously raised to kingship by the emperor&quot; through these acts, but the Emperor&#x27;s acts in Gniezno only symbolised that Bolesław received royal prerogatives, including the control of the Church in his realm. Radim Gaudentius was installed as the archbishop of the newly established Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno. At the same time, three suffragan bishoprics, subordinated to the see of Gniezno—the dioceses of Kołobrzeg, Kraków and Wrocław—were set up. Bolesław had promised that Poland would pay Peter&#x27;s Pence to the Holy See to obtain the pope&#x27;s sanction to the establishment of the new archdiocese. Unger, who had been the only prelate in Poland and was opposed to the creation of the archdiocese of Gniezno, was made bishop of Poznań, directly subordinated to the Holy See. However, Polish commoners only slowly adopted Christianity: Thietmar of Merseburg recorded that Bolesław forced his subjects with severe punishments to observe fasts and to refrain from adultery:

During the time the Emperor spent in Poland, Bolesław also showed off his affluence. At the end of the banquets, he &quot;ordered the waiters and the cupbearers to gather the gold and silver vessels ... from all three days&#x27; coursis, that is, the cups and goblets, the bowls and plates and the drinking-horns, and he presented them to the emperor as a toke of honor ... [h]is servants were likewise told to collect the wall-hangings and the coverlets, the carpets and tablecloths and napkins and everything that had been provided for their needs and take them to the emperor&#x27;s quarters&quot;, according to Gallus Anonymus. Thietmar of Merseburg recorded that Bolesław presented Otto III with a troop of &quot;three hundred armoured warriors&quot;. Bolesław also gave Saint Adalbert&#x27;s arm to the Emperor.

After the meeting, Bolesław escorted Otto III to Magdeburg in Germany where &quot;they celebrated Palm Sunday with great festivity&quot; on 25 March 1000. A continuator of the chronicle of Adémar de Chabannes recorded, decades after the events, that Bolesław also accompanied Emperor Otto from Magdeburg to Aachen where Otto III had Charlemagne&#x27;s tomb reopened and gave Charlemagne&#x27;s golden throne to Bolesław.

An illustrated Gospel, made for Otto III around 1000, depicted four women symbolising Roma, Gallia, Germania and Sclavinia as doing homage to the Emperor who sat on his throne. Historian Alexis P. Vlasto writes that &quot;Sclavinia&quot; referred to Poland, proving that it was regarded as one of the Christian realms subjected to the Holy Roman Empire in accordance with Otto III&#x27;s idea of &quot;Renovatio imperii&quot;—the renewal of the Roman Empire based on a federal concept. Within that framework, Poland, along with Hungary, was upgraded to an eastern &quot;foederatus&quot; of the Holy Roman Empire, according to historian Jerzy Strzelczyk.

Coins struck for Bolesław shortly after his meeting with the emperor bore the inscription Gnezdun Civitas, showing that he regarded Gniezno as his capital. The name of Poland was also recorded on the same coins referring to the Princes Polonie . The title &quot;princeps&quot; was almost exclusively used in Italy around that time, suggesting that it also represented the Emperor&#x27;s idea of the renewal of the Roman Empire. However, Otto&#x27;s premature death on 23 January 1002 put an end to his ambitious plans. The contemporaneous Bruno of Querfurt stated that &quot;nobody lamented&quot; the 22-year-old emperor&#x27;s &quot;death with greater grief than Bolesław&quot;.

In 1000 Bolesław issued a law prohibiting hunting beavers and created a office called &quot;Bobrowniczy&quot; whose task was to enforce prince&#x27;s ordinances.

== Expansion (1002–1018) ==

Three candidates were competing with each other for the German crown after Otto III&#x27;s death. One of them, Duke Henry IV of Bavaria, promised the Margraviate of Meissen to Bolesław in exchange for his assistance against Eckard I, Margrave of Meissen who was the most powerful contender. However, Eckard was murdered on 30 April 1002, which enabled Henry of Bavaria to defeat his last opponent, Herman II, Duke of Swabia. Fearing that Henry II would side with elements in the German Church hierarchy which were unfavorable towards Poland, and taking advantage of the chaos that followed Margrave Eckard&#x27;s death and Henry of Bavaria&#x27;s conflict with Henry of Schweinfurt, Bolesław invaded Lusatia and Meissen. He &quot;seized Margrave Gero&#x27;s march as far as the river Elbe&quot;, and also Bautzen, Strehla and Meissen. At the end of July, he participated at a meeting of the Saxon lords where Henry of Bavaria, who had meanwhile been crowned king of Germany, only confirmed Bolesław&#x27;s possession of Lusatia, and granted Meissen to Margrave Eckard&#x27;s brother, Gunzelin, and Strehla to Eckard&#x27;s oldest son, Herman. The relationship between King Henry and Bolesław became tense after assassins tried to murder Bolesław in Merseburg, because he accused the king of conspiracy against him. In retaliation, he seized and burned Strehla and took the inhabitants of the town into captivity.

Duke Boleslaus III of Bohemia was dethroned and the Bohemian lords made Vladivoj, who had earlier fled to Poland, duke in 1002. The Czech historian Dušan Třeštík writes that Vladivoj seized the Bohemian throne with Bolesław&#x27;s assistance. After Vladivoj died in 1003, Bolesław invaded Bohemia and restored Boleslaus III who had many Bohemian noblemen murdered. The Bohemian lords who survived the massacre &quot;secretly sent representatives&quot; to Bolesław, asking &quot;him to rescue them from fear of the future&quot;, according to Thietmar of Merseburg. Bolesław invaded Bohemia and had Boleslaus III blinded. He entered Prague in March 1003 where the Bohemian lords proclaimed him duke. King Henry sent his envoys to Prague, demanding that Bolesław take an oath of loyalty and pay tribute to him, but Bolesław refused to obey. He also allied himself with the king&#x27;s opponents, including Henry of Schweinfurt to whom he sent reinforcements. King Henry defeated Henry of Schweinfurt, forcing him to flee to Bohemia in August 1003. Bolesław invaded the Margraviate of Meissen, but Margrave Gunzelin refused to surrender his capital. It is also likely that Polish forces took control of Moravia and the northern parts of the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day mostly Slovakia) in 1003 as well. The proper conquest date of the Hungarian territories is 1003 or 1015 and this area stayed a part of Poland until 1018.

King Henry allied himself with the pagan Lutici, and broke into Lusatia in February 1004, but heavy snows forced him to withdraw. He invaded Bohemia in August 1004, taking the oldest brother of the blinded Boleslaus III of Bohemia, Jaromír, with him. The Bohemians rose up in open rebellion and murdered the Polish garrisons in the major towns. Bolesław left Prague without resistance, and King Henry made Jaromír duke of Bohemia on 8 September. Bolesław&#x27;s ally Soběslav died in this campaign.

During the next part of the offensive King Henry retook Meissen and in 1005, his army advanced as far into Poland as the city of Poznań where a peace treaty was signed. According to the peace treaty Bolesław lost Lusatia and Meissen and likely gave up his claim to the Bohemian throne. Also in 1005, a pagan rebellion in Pomerania overturned Bolesław&#x27;s rule and resulted in the destruction of the newly established local bishopric.

In 1007, after learning about Bolesław&#x27;s efforts to gain allies among Saxon nobles and giving refuge to the deposed duke of Bohemia, Oldřich, King Henry denounced the Peace of Poznań, which caused Bolesław&#x27;s attack on the Archbishopric of Magdeburg as well as the re-occupation of the marches of Lusatia, though he stopped short of retaking Meissen. The German counter-offensive began three years later (previously, Henry was occupied with rebellion in Flanders), in 1010, but it was of no significant consequence. In 1012, another ineffective campaign by archbishop Walthard of Magdeburg was launched, as he died during that campaign and, consequently, his forces returned home. Later that year, Bolesław once again invaded Lusatia. Bolesław&#x27;s forces pillaged and burned the city of Lubusz (Lebus). In 1013, a peace accord was signed at Merseburg. As part of the treaty, Bolesław paid homage to King Henry for the March of Lusatia (including the town of Bautzen) and Sorbian Meissen as fiefs. A marriage of Bolesław&#x27;s son Mieszko with Richeza of Lotharingia, daughter of the Count Palatine Ezzo of Lotharingia and granddaughter of Emperor Otto II, was also performed. During the brief period of peace on the western frontier that followed, Bolesław took part in a short campaign in the east, towards the Kievan Rus&#x27; territories.

In 1014, Bolesław sent his son Mieszko to Bohemia in order to form an alliance with Duke Oldrich against Henry, by then crowned emperor. Oldrich imprisoned Mieszko and turned him over to Henry, who, however, released him in a gesture of good will after being pressured by Saxon nobles. Bolesław nonetheless refused to aid the emperor militarily in his Italian expedition. This led to imperial intervention in Poland and so in 1015 a war erupted once again. The war started out well for the emperor, as he was able to defeat the Polish forces at the Battle of Ciani. Once the imperial forces crossed the river Oder, Bolesław sent a detachment of Moravian knights in a diversionary attack against the Eastern March of the empire. Soon after, the imperial army, having suffered a defeat near the Bóbr marshes, retreated from Poland without any permanent gains. After this event, Bolesław&#x27;s forces took the initiative. Margrave Gero II of Meissen was defeated and killed during a clash with the Polish forces in late 1015. In 1015 and 1017, Bolesław I attacked the Eastern March and was defeated twice by Henry the Strong and his forces.

Later that year, Bolesław&#x27;s son Mieszko was sent to plunder Meissen. His attempt at conquering the city, however, failed. In 1017, Bolesław defeated Duke Henry V of Bavaria. In that same year, supported by his Slavic allies, Emperor Henry once again invaded Poland, albeit once again to very little effect. He did besiege the cities of Głogów and Niemcza, but was unable to conquer them. The imperial forces once again were forced to retreat, suffering significant losses. Taking advantage of the involvement of Czech troops, Bolesław ordered his son to invade Bohemia, where Mieszko met very little resistance. On 30 January 1018, the Peace of Bautzen was signed. The Polish ruler was able to keep the contested marches of Lusatia and Sorbian Meissen not as fiefs, but as a part of Polish territory, and also received military aid in his expedition against Rus&#x27;. Also, Bolesław (then a widower) strengthened his dynastic bonds with the German nobility through his marriage with Oda, daughter of Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. The wedding took place four days later, on 3 February in the castle of &quot;Cziczani&quot; (also &quot;Sciciani&quot;, at the site of either modern Groß-Seitschen or Zützen).

==War in Kiev (1018)==

Bolesław organised his first expedition east, to support his son-in-law Sviatopolk I of Kiev, in 1013, but the decisive engagements were to take place in 1018 after the Peace of Bautzen was already signed. At the request of Sviatopolk I, in what became known as the Kiev Expedition of 1018, the Polish duke sent an expedition to Kievan Rus&#x27; with an army of 2,000–5,000 Polish warriors, in addition to Thietmar&#x27;s reported 1,000 Pechenegs, 300 German knights, and 500 Hungarian mercenaries. After collecting his forces during June, Bolesław led his troops to the border in July and on 23 July at the banks of the Bug River, near Wołyń, he defeated the forces of Yaroslav the Wise, Prince of Kiev, in what became known as the Battle of the River Bug. All primary sources agree that the Polish prince was victorious in battle. Yaroslav retreated north to Novgorod, opening the road to Kiev. The city, which suffered from fires caused by the Pecheneg siege, surrendered upon seeing the main Polish force on 14 August. The entering army, led by Bolesław, was ceremonially welcomed by the local archbishop and the family of Vladimir I of Kiev. According to popular legend Bolesław notched his sword (Szczerbiec) hitting the Golden Gate of Kiev. Although Sviatopolk lost the throne soon afterwards and lost his life the following year, during this campaign Poland re-annexed the Red Strongholds, later called Red Ruthenia, lost by Bolesław&#x27;s father in 981.

== Last years (1019–1025) ==
Historians dispute the exact date of Bolesław&#x27;s coronation. The year 1025 is most widely accepted by scholars, though the year 1000 is also likely. According to an epitaph, the crowning took place when Otto bestowed upon Bolesław royal regalia at the Congress of Gniezno. However, independent German sources confirmed that after Henry II&#x27;s death in 1024, Bolesław took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself king in 1025. It is generally assumed that the coronation took place on Easter Sunday 27 March 1025. However Tadeusz Wojciechowski believes that the coronation took place prior to that, on 24 December 1024. The basis for this assertion is that the coronations of kings were usually held during religious festivities. The exact place of the coronation is also highly debated, with the cathedrals of Gniezno or Poznań being the most probable locations. Poland was thereafter raised to the rank of a kingdom before its neighbour, Bohemia.

Wipo of Burgundy in his chronicle describes the event:

It is widely believed that Bolesław had to receive permission for his coronation from the newly-elected Pope John XIX. John was known to be corrupt, and it is likely that consent was or may have been obtained through bribes. However, Rome also hoped for a potential alliance to defend itself from Byzantine Emperor Basil II, who launched a military expedition to recover the island of Sicily and could subsequently threaten the Papal States from the south. Stanisław Zakrzewski put forward the theory that the coronation had the tacit consent of Conrad II and that the pope only confirmed that fact. That is corroborated by Conrad&#x27;s confirmation of the royal title to Mieszko II, his agreement with the counts of Tusculum and the papal interactions with Conrad and Bolesław.

==Death and burial==
According to Cosmas of Prague, Bolesław I died shortly after his coronation on 17 June 1025. Already in advanced age for the time, the true cause of death is unknown and remains a matter of speculation. Chronicler Jan Długosz (and followed by modern historians and archaeologists) writes that Bolesław was laid to rest at the Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul in Poznań. In the 14th century, Casimir III the Great reportedly ordered the construction of a new, presumably Gothic, sarcophagus to which he transferred Bolesław&#x27;s remains.

The medieval sarcophagus was partially damaged on 30 September 1772 during a fire, and completely destroyed in 1790 due to the collapse of the southern tower. Bolesław&#x27;s remains were subsequently excavated from the rubble and moved to the cathedral&#x27;s chapter house. Three bone fragments were donated to Tadeusz Czacki in 1801, at his request. Czacki, a notable Polish historian, pedagogue, and numismatist, placed one of the bone fragments in his ancestral mausoleum in Poryck (now Pavlivka) in the Volhynia region; the other two were given to Princess Izabela Flemming Czartoryska, who placed them in her recently founded Czartoryski Museum in Puławy. 

After many historical twists, the burial place of Bolesław I ultimately remained at Poznań Cathedral, in the Golden Chapel. The content of his epitaph is known to historians. It is Bolesław&#x27;s epitaph, which, in part, came from the original tombstone, that is one of the first sources (dated to the period immediately after Bolesław&#x27;s death, probably during the reign of Mieszko II) that gave the King his widely known nickname of &quot;Brave&quot; (Polish: &quot;Chrobry&quot;). Later, Gallus Anonymus, in Chapter 6 of his , named the Polish ruler as &quot;Bolezlavus qui dicebatur Gloriosus seu Chrabri&quot;.

==Family==

The contemporaneous Thietmar of Merseburg recorded Bolesław&#x27;s marriages, also mentioning his children. Bolesław&#x27;s first wife was a daughter of Rikdag, Margrave of Meissen. Historian Manteuffel says that the marriage was arranged in the early 980s by Mieszko I who wanted to strengthen his links with the Saxon lords and to enable his son to succeed Rikdag in Meissen. Bolesław &quot;later sent her away&quot;, according to Thietmar&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon&quot;. Historian Marek Kazimierz Barański writes that Bolesław repudiated his first wife after her father&#x27;s death in 985 which left the marriage without any political value.

Bolesław &quot;took a Hungarian woman&quot; as his second wife. Most historians identify her as a daughter of the Hungarian ruler Géza, but this theory has not been universally accepted. She gave birth to a son, Bezprym, but Bolesław repudiated her.

Bolesław&#x27;s third wife, Emnilda, was &quot;a daughter of the venerable lord, Dobromir&quot;. Her father was a West Slavic or Lechitic prince, either a local ruler from present-day Brandenburg who was closely related to the imperial Liudolfing dynasty, or the last independent prince of the Vistulans, before their incorporation into Poland. Wiszewski dates the marriage of Bolesław and Emnilda to 988. Emnilda exerted a beneficial influence on Bolesław, reforming &quot;her husband&#x27;s unstable character&quot;, according to Thietmar of Merseburg&#x27;s report. Bolesław&#x27;s and Emnilda&#x27;s oldest (unnamed) daughter &quot;was an abbess&quot; of an unidentified abbey. Their second daughter Regelinda, who was born in 989, was given in marriage to Herman I, Margrave of Meissen in 1002 or 1003. Mieszko II Lambert who was born in 990 was Bolesław&#x27;s favorite son and successor. The name of Bolesław&#x27;s and Emnilda&#x27;s third daughter, who was born in 995, is unknown; she married Sviatopolk I of Kiev between 1005 and 1012. Bolesław&#x27;s youngest son, Otto, was born in 1000.

Bolesław&#x27;s fourth marriage, from 1018 until his death, was to Oda ( 995–1025), daughter of Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. They had a daughter, Matilda ( 1018–1036), betrothed (or married) on 18 May 1035 to Otto of Schweinfurt.

Predslava, a daughter of Vladimir the Great and Rogneda, whom, along with her sister Mstislava, he had taken from Kiev in 1018, was his concubine.

<text>Robert Broom FRS FRSE (30 November 1866 6 April 1951) was a British- South African medical doctor and palaeontologist. He qualified as a medical practitioner in 1895 and received his DSc in 1905 from the University of Glasgow.

From 1903 to 1910, he was professor of zoology and geology at Victoria College, Stellenbosch, South Africa, and subsequently he became keeper of vertebrate palaeontology at the South African Museum, Cape Town.

==Life==

Broom was born at 66 Back Sneddon Street in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland, the son of John Broom, a designer of calico prints and Paisley shawls, and Agnes Hunter Shearer.

In 1893, he married Mary Baird Baillie, his childhood sweetheart.

In his medical studies at the University of Glasgow Broom specialised in obstetrics. After graduating in 1895 he travelled to Australia, supporting himself by practising medicine. He settled in South Africa in 1897, just prior to the South African War. From 1903 to 1910, he was professor of Zoology and Geology at Victoria College, Stellenbosch (later Stellenbosch University), but was forced out of this position for promoting belief in evolution. He established a medical practice in the Karoo region of South Africa, an area rich in therapsid fossils. Based on his continuing studies of these fossils and mammalian anatomy he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1920. Following the discovery of the Taung child he became interested in the search for human ancestors and commenced work on much more recent fossils from the dolomite caves north-west of Johannesburg, particularly Sterkfontein Cave (now part of the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site). As well as describing many mammalian fossils from these caves he identified several hominin fossils, the most complete of which was an australopithecine skull, nicknamed Mrs Ples, and a partial skeleton that indicated that australopithecines walked upright.

Broom died in Pretoria, South Africa in 1951.

== Contributions ==
Broom was first known for his study of therapsids. After Raymond Dart&#x27;s discovery of the Taung Child, an infant australopithecine, Broom&#x27;s interest in palaeoanthropology was heightened. Broom&#x27;s career seemed over and he was sinking into poverty, when Dart wrote to Jan Smuts about the situation. Smuts, exerting pressure on the South African government, managed to obtain a position for Broom in 1934 with the staff of the Transvaal Museum in Pretoria as an Assistant in Palaeontology.

Broom has been described as &quot;one of the great Karoo (and, in particular, therapsid) palaeontologists&quot;, having managed to describe 369 therapsid holotypes in his lifetime, which he ascribed to 168 new genera. Broom has a reputation as a &quot;splitter&quot; that has resulted in only around 57% of his holotypes still being considered valid as of 2003.

In the following years, he and John T. Robinson made a series of spectacular finds, including fragments from six hominins in Sterkfontein, which they named &quot;Plesianthropus transvaalensis&quot;, popularly called Mrs. Ples, but which was later classified as an adult &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot;, as well as more discoveries at sites in Kromdraai and Swartkrans. In 1937, Broom made his most famous discovery, by defining the robust hominin genus &quot;Paranthropus&quot; with his discovery of &quot;Paranthropus robustus&quot;. These discoveries helped support Dart&#x27;s claims for the Taung species.

For his volume, &quot;The South Africa Fossil Ape-Men, The Australopithecinae&quot;, in which he proposed the Australopithecinae subfamily, Broom was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1946.

The remainder of Broom&#x27;s career was devoted to the exploration of these sites and the interpretation of the many early hominin remains discovered there. He continued to write to the last. Shortly before his death he finished a monograph on the Australopithecines and remarked to his nephew:
::&quot;Now that&#x27;s finished ... and so am I.&quot;

== Spiritual evolution ==

Broom was a nonconformist and was deeply interested in the paranormal and spiritualism; he was a critic of Darwinism and materialism. Broom was a believer in spiritual evolution. In his book &quot;The Coming of Man: Was it Accident or Design?&quot; (1933) he claimed that &quot;spiritual agencies&quot; had guided evolution as animals and plants were too complex to have arisen by chance. According to Broom, there were at least two different kinds of spiritual forces, and psychics are capable of seeing them. Broom claimed there was a plan and purpose in evolution and that the origin of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; is the ultimate purpose behind evolution. According to Broom &quot;Much of evolution looks as if it had been planned to result in man, and in other animals and plants to make the world a suitable place for him to dwell in.&quot;

After discovering the skull of Mrs. Ples, Broom was asked if he excavated at random, Broom replied that spirits had told him where to find his discoveries.

== Research on the Khoisan ==
Broom had a noted interest in the Khoisan peoples, which included collecting their remains, including those of the recently deceased, as well as by digging up old graves. Broom first began collecting modern human remains in 1897, shortly after he moved to South Africa. In that year he collected the remains of three elderly &quot;Hottentot&quot; people that had died around Port Nolloth following a drought in the region. Broom stated that he &quot;cut their heads off and boiled them in paraffin tins on the kitchen stove&quot;. Their skulls were later sent to the medical school of the University of Edinburgh, alongside a 7 month old foetus, from which Broom had removed the brain which he preserved separately. Broom also obtained remains of deceased prisoners, stating: &quot;If a prisoner dies and you want his skeleton, probably two or three regulations stand in the way, but the enthusiast does not worry about such regulations.&quot; Broom said that he had buried several corpses in his garden allowing them to decay before later retrieving their bones. These include the remains of two men who were imprisoned in Douglas jail: Andreas Links, an 18 year old !Ora man, (catalogued as MMK 264), as well an unnamed 18 year old &quot;bushman&quot; from Langeberg (catalogued as MMK 283), who was photographed while alive at the request of Broom, despite this being against policy. The skeletons of both men were added to the collections of the McGregor Museum in 1921.

Broom described the Khoisan peoples as a &quot;degenerate&quot; and &quot;degraded race&quot;, speculating in 1907 that they descended from &quot;the race which built the Pyramids&quot; and &quot;Mongoloids&quot;, but had &quot;degenerated&quot; due to South Africa&#x27;s hot climate. In his later works he divided the Khoisan peoples into three races, the Bushmen, Hottentot and Korana, based on supposed typological differences, with the type specimen of the Korana race being the skeleton of Links. Other contemporary anthropologists questioned this classification scheme, especially the Korana race. Broom later said that he had &quot;invented the Korana&quot;. All such typological racial classification schemes are discredited today, due to being based on vague criteria, resulting in the rigid categorization ultimately being arbitrary. Anatomist Goran Štrkalj wrote that: &quot;It is obvious that Broom&#x27;s anthropological work was ... influenced by the racist stereotypes and prejudices of the day&quot;.

<text>A wall is a structure and a surface that defines an area; carries a load; provides security, shelter, or soundproofing; or serves a decorative purpose. There are various types of walls, including border barriers between countries, brick walls, defensive walls in fortifications, and retaining walls that hold back dirt, stone, water, or noise. Walls can also be found in buildings, where they support roofs, floors, and ceilings, enclose spaces, and provide shelter and security.

The construction of walls can be categorized into framed walls and mass-walls. Framed walls transfer the load to the foundation through posts, columns, or studs and typically consist of structural elements, insulation, and finish elements. Mass-walls are made of solid materials such as masonry, concrete, adobe, or rammed earth. Walls may also house utilities like electrical wiring or plumbing and must conform to local building and fire codes.

Walls have historically served defensive purposes, with the term &quot;wall&quot; originally referring to defensive walls and ramparts. Examples of famous defensive walls include the Great Wall of China and Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. In addition to their functional roles, walls can also be decorative, contributing to the aesthetic appeal of a space.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;wall&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;vallum&quot; meaning &quot;an earthen wall or rampart set with palisades, a row or line of stakes, a wall, a rampart, fortification&quot;, while the Latin word &quot;murus&quot; means a defensive stone wall. 
English uses the same word to mean an external wall and the internal sides of a room, but this is not universal. Many languages distinguish between the two. In German, some of this distinction can be seen between &quot;Wand&quot; and &quot;Mauer&quot;, in Spanish between &quot;pared&quot; and &quot;muro&quot;.

==Defensive wall==

The word wall originally referred to defensive walls and ramparts.

==Building wall==

The purposes of walls in buildings are to support roofs, floors and ceilings; to enclose a space as part of the building envelope along with a roof to give buildings form; and to provide shelter and security. In addition, the wall may house various types of utilities such as electrical wiring or plumbing. Wall construction falls into two basic categories: &quot;framed walls&quot; or &quot;mass-walls&quot;. In framed walls the load is transferred to the foundation through posts, columns or studs. Framed walls most often have three or more separate components: the structural elements (such as 2×4 studs in a house wall), insulation, and finish elements or surfaces (such as drywall or panelling). Mass-walls are of a solid material including masonry, concrete including slipform stonemasonry, log building, cordwood construction, adobe, rammed earth, cob, earthbag construction, bottles, tin cans, straw-bale construction, and ice. Walls may or may not be leadbearing. Walls are required to conform to the local building and/or fire codes.

There are three basic methods walls control water intrusion: moisture storage, drained cladding, or face-sealed cladding. Moisture storage is typical of stone and brick &quot;mass-wall&quot; buildings where moisture is absorbed and released by the walls of the structure itself. &quot;Drained cladding&quot; also known as &quot;screened walls&quot; acknowledges moisture will penetrate the cladding so a &quot;moisture barrier&quot; such as housewrap or felt paper inside the cladding provides a second line of defense and sometimes a &quot;drainage plane&quot; or &quot;air gap&quot; allows a path for the moisture to drain down through and exit the wall. Sometimes ventilation is provided in addition to the drainage plane such as in rainscreen construction. &quot;Face-sealed&quot; also called &quot;barrier wall&quot; or &quot;perfect barrier&quot; cladding relies on maintaining a leak-free surface of the cladding. Examples of face sealed cladding are the early exterior insulation finishing systems, structural glazing, metal clad panels, and corrugated metal.

Building walls frequently become works of art, externally and internally, such as when featuring mosaic work or when murals are painted on them; or as design foci when they exhibit textures or painted finishes for effect.

===Curtain wall===

In architecture and civil engineering, curtain wall refers to a building facade that is not load-bearing but provides decoration, finish, front, face, or historical preservation.

===Precast wall===
Precast walls are walls which have been manufactured in a factory and then shipped to where it is needed, ready to install. It is faster to install compared to brick and other walls and may have a lower cost compared to other types of wall. Precast walls are cost effective compare to Brick Wall compound wall.

===Mullion wall===

Mullion walls are a structural system that carries the load of the floor slab on prefabricated panels around the perimeter.

===Partition wall===

A partition wall is a usually thin wall that is used to separate or divide a room, primarily a pre-existing one. Partition walls are usually not load-bearing, and can be constructed out of many materials, including steel panels, bricks, cloth, plastic, plasterboard, wood, blocks of clay, terracotta, concrete, and glass.

Some partition walls are made of sheet glass. Glass partition walls are a series of individual toughened glass panels mounted in wood or metal framing. They may be suspended from or slide along a robust aluminium ceiling track. The system does not require the use of a floor guide, which allows easy operation and an uninterrupted threshold.

A timber partition consists of a wooden framework, supported on the floor or by side walls. Metal lath and plaster, properly laid, forms a reinforced partition wall. Partition walls constructed from fibre cement backer board are popular as bases for tiling in kitchens or in wet areas like bathrooms. Galvanized sheet fixed to wooden or steel members are mostly adopted in works of temporary character. Plain or reinforced partition walls may also be constructed from concrete, including pre-cast concrete blocks. Metal framed partitioning is also available. This partition consists of track (used primarily at the base and head of the partition) and studs (vertical sections fixed into the track typically spaced at 24&quot;, 16&quot;, or at 12&quot;).

Internal wall partitions, also known as office partitioning, are usually made of plasterboard (drywall) or varieties of glass. Toughened glass is a common option, as low-iron glass (better known as &quot;opti-white glass&quot;) increases light and solar heat transmission.

Wall partitions are constructed using beads and tracking that is either hung from the ceiling or fixed into the ground. The panels are inserted into the tracking and fixed. Some wall partition variations specify their fire resistance and acoustic performance rating.

;Movable partitions

Movable partitions are walls that open to join two or more rooms into one large floor area. These include:
* Sliding—a series of panels that slide in tracks fixed to the floor and ceiling, similar sliding doors
* Sliding and folding doors —similar to sliding folding doors, these are good for smaller spans
* Folding partition walls - a series of interlocking panels suspended from an overhead track that when extended provide an acoustical separation, and when retracted stack against a wall, ceiling, closet, or ceiling pocket.
* Screens—usually constructed of a metal or timber frame fixed with plywood and chipboard and supported with legs for free standing and easy movement
* Pipe and drape—fixed or telescopic uprights and horizontals provide a ground supported drape system with removable panels.

===Party wall===
Party walls are walls that separate buildings or units within a building. They provide fire resistance and sound resistance between occupants in a building. The minimum fire resistance and sound resistance required for the party wall is determined by a building code and may be modified to suit a variety of situations. Ownership of such walls can become a legal issue. It is not a load-bearing wall and may be owned by different people.

===Infill wall===
An infill wall is the supported wall that closes the perimeter of a building constructed with a three-dimensional framework structure.

===Fire wall===

Fire walls resist spread of fire within or sometimes between structures to provide passive fire protection. A delay in the spread of fire gives occupants more time to escape and fire fighters more time to extinguish the fire. Some fire walls allow fire resistive window assemblies, and are made of non-combustible material such as concrete, cement block, brick, or fire rated drywall. Wall penetrations are sealed with fire resistive materials. A doorway in a firewall must have a rated fire door. Fire walls provide varying resistance to the spread of fire, (e.g., one, two, three or four hours). Firewalls can also act as smoke barriers when constructed vertically from slab to roof deck and horizontally from an exterior wall to exterior wall subdividing a building into sections.

===Shear wall===

Shear walls resist lateral forces such as in an earthquake or severe wind. There are different kinds of shear walls such as the steel plate shear wall.

===Knee wall===

Knee walls are short walls that either support rafters or add height in the top floor rooms of houses. In a -story house, the knee wall supports the &quot;half story&quot;.

===Cavity wall===

Cavity walls are walls made with a space between two &quot;skins&quot; to inhibit heat transfer.

===Pony wall===
Pony wall (or dwarf wall) is a general term for short walls, such as:
* A half wall that only extends partway from floor to ceiling, without supporting anything
* A stem wall—a concrete wall that extends from the foundation slab to the cripple wall or floor joists
* A cripple wall—a framed wall from the stem wall or foundation slab to the floor joists

===Demountable wall===

Demountable walls fall into 3 different main types:
*Glass walls (unitesed panels or butt joint),
*Laminated particle board walls (this may also include other finishes, such as whiteboards, cork board, magnetic, etc., typically all on purpose-made wall studs)
*Drywall

===Solar energy===
A trombe wall in passive solar building design acts as a heat sink.

==Shipbuilding==

On a ship, a wall that separates major compartments is called a &quot;bulkhead&quot;. A thinner wall between cabins is called a &quot;partition&quot;.

==Boundary wall==

Boundary walls include privacy walls, boundary-marking walls on property, and town walls. These intergrade into fences. The conventional differentiation is that a fence is of minimal thickness and often open in nature, while a wall is usually more than a nominal thickness and is completely closed, or opaque. More to the point, an exterior structure of wood or wire is generally called a fence—but one of masonry is a wall. A common term for both is barrier, which is convenient for structures that are partly wall and partly fence—for example the Berlin Wall. Another kind of wall-fence ambiguity is the ha-ha—which is set below ground level to protect a view, yet acts as a barrier (to cattle, for example).
Before the invention of artillery, many of the world&#x27;s cities and towns, particularly in Europe and Asia, had defensive or protective walls (also called town walls or city walls). In fact, the English word &quot;wall&quot; derives from Latin &quot;vallum&quot;—a type of fortification wall. These walls are no longer relevant for defense, so such cities have grown beyond their walls, and many fortification walls, or portions of them, have been torn down—for example in Rome, Italy and Beijing, China. Examples of protective walls on a much larger scale include the Great Wall of China and Hadrian&#x27;s Wall.

==Border wall==

Some walls formally mark the border between one population and another. A border wall is constructed to limit the movement of people across a certain line or border. These structures vary in placement with regard to international borders and topography. The most famous example of border barrier in history is probably the Great Wall of China, a series of walls that separated the Empire of China from nomadic powers to the north. The most prominent recent example is the Berlin Wall, which surrounded the enclave of West Berlin and separated it from East Germany for most of the Cold War era. The US-Mexico border wall, separating the United States and Mexico, is another recent example.

==Retaining wall==


In areas of rocky soils around the world, farmers have often pulled large quantities of stone out of their fields to make farming easier and have stacked those stones to make walls that either mark the field boundary, or the property boundary, or both.

Retaining walls resist movement of earth, stone, or water. They may be part of a building or external. The ground surface or water on one side of a retaining wall is typically higher than on the other side. A dike is a retaining wall, as is a levee, a load-bearing foundation wall, and a sea wall.

==Shared wall==
Special laws often govern walls that neighbouring properties share. Typically, one neighbour cannot alter the common wall if it is likely to affect the building or property on the other side. A wall may also separate apartment or hotel rooms from each other. Each wall has two sides and breaking a wall on one side will break the wall on the other side.

==Portable wall==
Portable walls, such as room dividers or portable partitions divide a larger open space into smaller rooms. Portable walls can be static, such as cubicle walls, or can be wall panels mounted on casters to provide an easy way to reconfigure assembly space. They are often found inside schools, churches, convention centers, hotels, and corporate facilities.

==Temporary wall==
A temporary wall is constructed for easy removal or demolition. A typical temporary wall can be constructed with 1⁄2&quot; (6 mm) to 5⁄8&quot; (16 mm) sheet rock (plasterboard), metal 2 × 3s (approx. 5 × 7 cm), or 2 × 4s, or taped, plastered and compounded. Most installation companies use lattice (strips of wood) to cover the joints of the temporary wall with the ceiling. These are sometimes known as pressurized walls or temporary pressurized walls.

==Walls in popular culture==
Walls are often seen in popular culture, oftentimes representing barriers preventing progress or entry. For example:

;Fictional and symbolic walls

The progressive/psychedelic rock band Pink Floyd used a metaphorical wall to represent the isolation felt by the protagonist of their 1979 concept album &quot;The Wall&quot;.

The American poet laureate Robert Frost describes a pointless rock wall as a metaphor for the myopia of the culture-bound in his poem &quot;Mending Wall&quot;, published in 1914.

Walls are a recurring symbol in Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s 1974 novel &quot;The Dispossessed&#x27;.

In some cases, a wall may refer to an individual&#x27;s debilitating mental or physical condition, seen as an impassable barrier.

In George R. R. Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series and its television adaptation, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, The Wall plays multiple important roles: as a colossal fortification, made of ice and fortified with magic spells; as a cultural barrier; and as a codification of assumptions. Breaches of the wall, who is allowed to cross it and who is not, and its destruction have important symbolic, logistical, and socio-political implications in the storyline. Reportedly over 700 feet high and 100 leagues (300 miles) wide, it divides the northern border of the Seven Kingdoms realm from the domain of the wildlings and several categories of undead who live beyond it.

;Historical walls
In a real-life example, the Berlin Wall, constructed by the Soviet Union to divide Berlin into NATO and Warsaw Pact zones of occupation, became a worldwide symbol of oppression and isolation.

;Social media walls
Another common usage is as a communal surface to write upon. For instance the social networking site Facebook previously used an electronic &quot;wall&quot; to log the scrawls of friends until it was replaced by the &quot;timeline&quot; feature.

<doc id="39010" wikidata="Q47875" url="?curid=39010" title="Robbie Williams">
<text>Robert Peter Williams (born 13 February 1974) is an English singer and songwriter. He found fame as a member of the pop group Take That from 1990 to 1995, launching a solo career in 1996. His debut studio album, &quot;Life thru a Lens&quot;, was released in 1997, and included his best-selling single &quot;Angels&quot;. His second album, &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Expecting You&quot;, featured the songs &quot;Millennium&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot;, his first and second number one singles. His discography includes seven UK No. 1 singles, and all but one of his 14 studio albums have reached No. 1 in the UK. Six of his albums are among the top 100 biggest-selling albums in the UK, with two of them in the top 60, and he gained a Guinness World Record in 2006 for selling 1.6 million tickets in a single day during his Close Encounters Tour.

Williams has received a record 18 Brit Awards, winning Best British Male Artist four times, Outstanding Contribution to Music twice, an Icon Award for his lasting impact on British culture, eight German ECHO Awards, and three MTV European Music Awards. In 2004, he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame after being voted the Greatest Artist of the 1990s. According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), he has been certified for 20.36 million albums and 10 million singles in the UK as a solo artist. Five of his albums have also topped the Australian albums chart, and has sold 75 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He also topped the 2000–2010 UK airplay chart. His three concerts at Knebworth in 2003 drew over 375,000 people, the UK&#x27;s biggest music event to that point. In 2014, he was awarded the freedom of his hometown of Stoke-on-Trent and had a tourist trail created and streets named in his honour. Williams&#x27; latest compilation album, &quot;XXV&quot;, was released on 9 September 2022.

After 15 years, Williams rejoined Take That in 2010 to co-write and perform lead vocals on their album &quot;Progress&quot;, which became the second-fastest-selling album in UK chart history and the fastest-selling record of the century at the time. The subsequent stadium tour, which featured seven songs from Williams&#x27; solo career, became the biggest-selling concert in UK history when it sold 1.34 million tickets in less than 24 hours. In 2011, Take That frontman Gary Barlow confirmed that Williams had left the band for a second time to focus on his solo career, although he stated that the departure was amicable and that Williams was welcome to rejoin Take That in the future. Williams has since performed with Take That on three separate television appearances, and collaborated with Barlow on a number of projects such as the West End musical &quot;The Band&quot;. In 2024, a film based on Williams&#x27; life, &quot;Better Man&quot;, was released.

==Early life ==
Robert Peter Williams was born on 13 February 1974 in Stoke-on-Trent, the son of Janet (née Farrell) and Peter Williams (also known as Pete Conway), who ran a pub called the Red Lion in Burslem before becoming the licensee at the Port Vale Social Club. His maternal grandfather was an Irishman from Kilkenny. He attended St Margaret Ward Catholic School in Tunstall and participated in several school plays, most notably in the role of the Artful Dodger in a production of &quot;Oliver!&quot;

==Take That==
===1990–1995: First stint===
In 1990, the sixteen-year-old Williams was the youngest member to join Take That. According to the documentary &quot;Take That: For the Record&quot;, his mother read an advertisement seeking members for a new boy band and suggested that he try out for the group. He met fellow member Mark Owen on the day of his audition/interview with Nigel Martin-Smith. Although the majority of the group&#x27;s material was written and performed by Gary Barlow, Williams performed lead vocals on three hits &quot;Could It Be Magic&quot;, &quot;I Found Heaven&quot;, and &quot;Everything Changes&quot;. Williams&#x27; use of alcohol and cocaine brought him into conflict with Martin-Smith over the behaviour rules for Take That members.

In November 1994, Williams&#x27;s drug use had escalated; he nearly had a drug overdose the night before the group was scheduled to perform at the MTV Europe Music Awards. According to the documentary &quot;For the Record&quot;, he was unhappy with his musical ideas not being taken seriously by Martin-Smith and lead singer Barlow; his desire to explore hip hop and rap conflicted with Take That&#x27;s usual ballads. Barlow stated in interviews that Williams had given up trying to offer creative input.

Noting Williams&#x27;s increasingly belligerent behaviour and poor attendance at rehearsals, and worried that he might leave the group during their upcoming tour, Barlow and Jason Orange took their concerns to Martin-Smith. During one of the last rehearsals before the tour commenced, the three confronted Williams about his attitude and stated they wanted to do the tour without him. He agreed to quit and left the group in July 1995; it would be the last time for twelve years that they were all together. Despite the departure of Williams, Take That completed their Nobody Else Tour as a four-piece. They later disbanded on 13 February 1996, Williams&#x27;s 22nd birthday.

Shortly afterwards, Williams was photographed by the press partying with the members of Oasis at Glastonbury Festival. Following his departure, he became the subject of talk shows and newspapers as he acknowledged his plans to become a solo singer, and he was spotted partying with George Michael in France. A clause in his Take That contract prohibited him from releasing any material until after the group was officially dissolved, and he was later sued by Martin-Smith and forced to pay $200,000 in commission. After various legal battles over his right to a solo career, Williams succeeded in getting released from his contract with BMG. On 27 June 1996, he signed with Chrysalis Records.

===2006–2011: Second stint===

By March 2009, Williams had shown interest in rejoining Take That; the band completed their tour, The Circus Live, without him. In spite of rumours that Williams was working in New York with Take That in September that year, by the day of the &quot;Children in Need&quot; charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall in November they were still performing separately. Both did join with the other acts in the final song of the evening, with Williams putting his arm around Gary Barlow and singing &quot;Hey Jude&quot;.

On 15 July 2010, Williams reconciled with his former colleagues and rejoined Take That. In November 2010 the Take That album &quot;Progress&quot; was released, becoming the fastest selling album since 2000 and the second fastest selling album in UK history. The group travelled across the UK on their Progress Live tour, which included eight nights at Wembley Stadium in London, then continued across Europe. The tour was the fastest selling in UK history with ticket hotlines and websites crashing under the demand.

In August 2012, Take That performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics. Williams was due to perform with Take That but missed the performance because his wife gave birth at around the same time; the group performed as a four-piece.

Although still officially part of Take That, Williams chose not to return for group&#x27;s seventh and eighth studio albums and their accompanying tours, focusing instead on his solo commitments. He continued to write music with his colleagues and has performed with the group on several occasions since 2011&#x27;s Progress tour and planned to return for a full tour to celebrate Take That&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 2019.

==Solo career==

===1996–1998: &quot;Life thru a Lens&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Expecting You&quot;===

Williams launched his solo career in 1996 with a cover of George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Freedom&quot;, which reached number two in the UK Singles Chart. Recordings for Williams&#x27;s first album began at London&#x27;s Maison Rouge studios in March 1997. Shortly after his introduction to songwriter and producer Guy Chambers, Williams released &quot;Old Before I Die&quot;, the first single from his debut album. The single reached number two on the UK Charts; it was largely ignored on international charts. His debut album, &quot;Life thru a Lens&quot;, was released in September 1997. The album launched with his first live solo gig at the Élysée Montmartre theatre in Paris, France. The album debuted at number eleven on the UK Albums Chart.

&quot;Angels&quot;, the fourth single, is Williams&#x27; best-seller in the United Kingdom. The song, apart from becoming a hit around Europe and Latin America, caused sales of his album to skyrocket. The album remained in the British top ten for forty weeks and spent 218 weeks there altogether, making it the 58th best selling album in UK history with sales of over 2.4 million. The album eventually managed to sell over three million copies in Europe.

Williams and Chambers started writing the second album, &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Expecting You&quot;, in Jamaica in early 1998. The first single, &quot;Millennium&quot;, accompanied with a music video featuring Williams parodying James Bond, complete with tuxedo and references to Bond films like &quot;Thunderball&quot; and &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;, became Williams&#x27; first solo number one single in the United Kingdom. It also became a top twenty hit in many European countries, Latin America and Australia.

&quot;I&#x27;ve Been Expecting You&quot; was released in late October 1998 and debuted at number one in the UK Albums Chart. The album received more attention outside the United Kingdom, leaving its mark in the European and Latin American markets with hits such as &quot;No Regrets&quot;, a collaboration with the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; singer Neil Tennant and the Divine Comedy&#x27;s Neil Hannon. &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot;, a cover of a World Party track written by Karl Wallinger, became Williams&#x27; second UK number-one single. Williams finished the year with a European Tour late in 1999. &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Expecting You&quot; sold almost 3 million copies in the UK and was certified 10× Platinum by the BPI. In Europe, the album sold over 4 million copies.

===1999–2001: &quot;Sing When You&#x27;re Winning&quot; and &quot;Swing When You&#x27;re Winning&quot;===

In 1999, Williams was signed to Capitol Records in the United States, a part of EMI. He embarked on a United States promotional tour and released his first United States and Canadian single, &quot;Millennium&quot;. The compilation album &quot;The Ego Has Landed&quot; was released in July 1999 in the United States and Canada. In the middle of promotion and the tours in 1999, Williams began work on his third studio album.

The first single taken from the album was &quot;Rock DJ&quot;, a song inspired by Williams&#x27;s UNICEF mentor, the late Ian Dury. The video created by Fred &amp; Farid showed Williams in an attempt to get noticed by a group of women, first stripping and then tearing chunks of skin and muscle from his body, and caused controversy in the United Kingdom and many other countries. The video was edited by &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; for its graphic content and many other channels followed suit. The song became an instant hit, reaching number one in the UK (becoming his third number one single as a solo artist) and New Zealand. The song went on to win &quot;Best Song of 2000&quot; at the MTV Europe Music Awards, &quot;Best Single of the Year&quot; at the Brit Awards and an MTV Video Music Award for Best Special Effects.

When the album, &quot;Sing When You&#x27;re Winning&quot; was released in August 2000, it topped the charts in many different countries. In the UK the album was certified 2× Platinum on its first week of release. After the success of his third album, Williams wanted to take another musical direction. He took two weeks off from his tour to record &quot;Swing When You&#x27;re Winning&quot;, his fourth studio album. Born from his lifelong love for Frank Sinatracombined with the success of the track &quot;Have You Met Miss Jones?&quot; that he recorded for the film &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27; Diary&quot; in 2001the album was recorded at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles.

Williams took the chance to duet with his long-time friend Jonathan Wilkes, &quot;Little Voice&quot; star Jane Horrocks, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; star Jon Lovitz, Rupert Everett and actress Nicole Kidman. The first single released from the album was a duet with Kidman, on &quot;Somethin&#x27; Stupid&quot;. Originally a hit for Frank and Nancy Sinatra, the song became Williams&#x27; fifth number one hit in the UK. It eventually went on to become one of the biggest hits of 2001. &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; was featured over the credits of the film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; in 2003 and was also released on the film&#x27;s soundtrack CD. A DVD, &quot;Robbie Williams Live at the Albert Hall&quot;, was released in December of that year and has become one of the best selling music DVDs in Europe, being certified 6× Platinum in the United Kingdom and 2× Platinum in Germany.

===2002–2005: &quot;Escapology&quot; and &quot;Intensive Care&quot;===

In 2002, Williams signed a record-breaking £80 million contract with EMI. The contract included a number of provisos, including the label ceding greater creative control to the artist and a commitment to breaking Williams into the US market. It remains the biggest music deal in British history. The deal was brokered by Ingenious Media, a UK corporate finance advisory business. Williams began working on what would be his fifth studio album, spending a year in the recording studio. The album heralded a new era for Williams. He had taken a more active role in the making of this album. &quot;One Fine Day&quot;, &quot;Nan&#x27;s Song&quot;, and &quot;Come Undone&quot; were the first songs that Williams wrote without the input of Guy Chambers. Most of the songs were recorded in Los Angeles.
The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Feel&quot;, written by Williams and Chambers, was recorded as a demo. When they started working on the album and were trying to re-record the vocals, Williams felt dissatisfied with it, so he decided to include the demo version and then release it as the first single. When the single was released in late 2002, it became Williams&#x27; biggest international hit, going number one in The Netherlands and Italy and reaching the top ten in many European countries. When Williams&#x27; fifth studio album, &quot;Escapology&quot;, was released in late 2002, it hit number one in at least 10 countries around the world. In the United States, it failed to make such an impact. &quot;Escapology&quot; sold almost 2 million copies by the end of 2003 in the United Kingdom. On 1–3 August 2003, Williams played three consecutive concerts at Knebworth to 125,000 people each night, making it the biggest event in UK music history. Memorable performances included &quot;Come Undone&quot; where he interjected with &quot;Britain, I&#x27;m Your Son&quot;, and further interacted with the audience when he brought a girl up on stage. In October 2003, Williams released a live album of the concerts, &quot;Live at Knebworth&quot;.

In October 2004, Williams released &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, a retrospective of his career, which also contained new tracks he had been working on with then-new collaborator Stephen Duffy. &quot;Radio&quot;, the compilation&#x27;s first single, debuted at number one in the UK Singles Chart, becoming Williams&#x27; sixth number-one hit. When the compilation was released, it debuted at number one in the UK and was the best selling album of the year in the UK and Europe. Eight years after the release of &quot;Angels&quot;, the British public voted it as the &quot;Best Single of the Past Twenty-Five Years&quot; at the 2005 Brit Awards.

After touring Latin America in late 2004 for the promotion &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, Williams started working on his sixth studio album. Recorded at his house in the Hollywood Hills, the album was co-written by Stephen Duffy over the course of 24 months. The album &quot;Intensive Care&quot; was launched in Berlin on 9 October. It became an international hit. In November 2005, Williams took home the MTV Europe Music Award for &#x27;Best Male&#x27;, but also, entered in &quot;The Guinness Book of World Records&quot; when he announced his World Tour for 2006, selling 1.6 million tickets in one single day. Williams kicked off his &quot;Close Encounters World Tour&quot; in South Africa in April 2006; when he finished his European leg of the tour, 2.5 million people had seen the show and, after touring Latin America and Australia, the numbers went up to 3 million.

===2006–2009: &quot;Rudebox&quot; and &quot;Reality Killed the Video Star&quot;===

Williams released his much anticipated dance/electro album, &quot;Rudebox&quot;, on 23 October 2006. It featured collaborations with the Pet Shop Boys, William Orbit, Soul Mekanik, Joey Negro, Mark Ronson, Chris Grierson, and The Orr Boys. It received mixed reviews: Allmusic gave it a four star rating, the &quot;NME&quot; 8 out of 10, and Music Week and MOJO were equally positive, but it received much weaker reviews from some of the British press. The album sold 2× Platinum in Europe with sales of over 2 million making it the fastest platinum-selling album of 2006. To promote his album, Williams commissioned a series of short films. &quot;Goodbye to the Normals&quot; was directed by Jim Field Smith and features &quot;Burslem Normals&quot; by Williams.

In February 2009, it was confirmed that Williams had written material with Guy Chambers and Mark Ronson. A spokesman said that Williams was planning to begin the recording sessions in March and that the new album would be released in late 2009. This will probably be the last Williams album released by EMI. On his official website, Williams confirmed that he was working with producer Trevor Horn on his new album, which would eventually be titled &quot;Reality Killed the Video Star&quot;, a reference to the song &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; by Horn&#x27;s former band the Buggles. The album was released on 9 November 2009 in the United Kingdom.

On 11 October 2009 Williams published a 12-track compilation album, titled &quot;Songbook&quot;, as a free CD for the newspaper &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;. That same evening, Williams made his &quot;comeback&quot; on &quot;The X Factor&quot; results show, performing his new single &quot;Bodies&quot; for the first time live. On 20 October 2009 Williams opened the BBC Electric Proms at the London RoundHouse. It was his first live concert for 3 years and was broadcast across 200 cinemas worldwide. Accompanied by a string section, horn section, full band and producer Trevor Horn, Williams performed several new tracks from &quot;Reality Killed the Video Star&quot; and older tracks.

&quot;Reality Killed the Video Star&quot; was previewed in the UK on the Spotify music streaming service on 6 November 2009, and official released on 9 November. In a high-profile chart battle, Williams&#x27; album was pitted against &quot;X Factor&quot; 2008 runners-up JLS who released their debut album the same day. JLS beat Williams to the number one spot by 1500 sales. The album was also released in the United States (Williams&#x27; first album to be released there since 2002&#x27;s &quot;Escapology&quot;). In late November 2009, Williams travelled to Australia to perform at the ARIA Music Awards of 2009.

=== 2010–2012: &quot;In and Out of Consciousness&quot; and &quot;Take the Crown&quot; ===
In October 2010, Williams released his second greatest hits album, &quot;In and Out of Consciousness: The Greatest Hits 1990–2010&quot;, to celebrate 20 years as a performing artist. A single, &quot;Shame&quot;, was also released, which was written and sung by Williams and Barlow.

On 21 October 2011 Williams signed with Island Records (Universal Music), following his departure from his previous record label EMI in 2010.

Williams was the opening act at the Diamond Jubilee Concert, which was co-organised by Gary Barlow, held outside Buckingham Palace on 4 June 2012. During the end of August his official website began a countdown to the release of information regarding his latest solo material, with an image of his face and his mind unveiled daily as the countdown expired. Titled &quot;Take the Crown&quot;, the album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart making it Williams&#x27; tenth number one album. It also marked the second time that Williams had a number one single (&quot;Candy&quot;) and album at the same time on the chart. The first time was in 2001 when &quot;Somethin&#x27; Stupid&quot; and &quot;Swing When You&#x27;re Winning&quot; were number one on the singles and albums chart respectively.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Candy&quot;, premiered on 10 September 2012 and was released on 11 September in most countries and 29 October in the UK. In the UK, &quot;Candy&quot; became Williams&#x27; first number one single since &quot;Radio&quot; (2004) and his seventh solo number one single. In its first week the song had sold 137,000 copies becoming the fastest-selling male artist single of the year. On 26 November 2012 Williams announced a 17 date stadium tour of Europe. Williams also confirmed that the support act for the tour would be Olly Murs who also duets with him on &quot;Kids&quot;. Universal and EMI merged in 2012, bringing Williams&#x27; Chrysalis/Virgin recordings full circle to Universal.

===2013–2014: &quot;Swings Both Ways&quot; and &quot;Under the Radar Volume 1&quot;===

In September 2013, Williams announced a follow-up to his 2001 swing album, titled &quot;Swings Both Ways&quot; for release in November. The album features covers and original songs, whilst also including duet recordings with Michael Bublé, Olly Murs, Rufus Wainwright, Lily Allen and Kelly Clarkson. In November 2013, Williams made a cameo appearance in the video to Murs&#x27;s song &quot;Hand on Heart&quot;.

Williams released a compilation album entitled &quot;Under the Radar Volume 1&quot; on 1 December 2014 through his website, featuring leftovers and unreleased songs. &quot;[These are] loads and loads of songs that I have written that I am incredibly passionate about, I want you to hear them, otherwise they are just going to remain in my computer!&quot; Williams said that Guy Chambers was &quot;not happy&quot; about these songs being released online: &quot;He thinks I am a lunatic for not putting them on an album that we have promoted with TV performances and at radio stations and a big tour,&quot; Williams said. &quot;But I am an impetuous bugger, and I want them out now, now, now!&quot;

=== 2016–2018: &quot;The Heavy Entertainment Show&quot;, and &quot;The X Factor&quot; ===
In May 2016, it was announced that Williams had signed a recording contract with Sony Music. In a statement, Williams said: &quot;They&#x27;re [Sony Music] inspired, I&#x27;m inspired. I&#x27;m more ready than I ever have been and I&#x27;m totally convinced I&#x27;m in the right place. I look forward to working on this album, which is an album I&#x27;m immensely proud of, in this exciting new partnership with Sony Music.&quot; &quot;The Heavy Entertainment Show&quot; became his 12th UK number-one album, putting him level with Madonna. In July 2017, Williams announced a new album, &quot;Under the Radar Volume 2&quot;, which was released in November 2017. A third edition in the Under the Radar series was released on Valentine&#x27;s Day of 2019.
On 14 June 2018, Williams performed at the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony held at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia. Williams sang 
&quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot; and &quot;Feel&quot; before he performed a duet of &quot;Angels&quot; with Russian soprano Aida Garifullina. Williams then performed an encore with &quot;Rock DJ&quot;, during which he gave the finger. Fox in the U.S. apologised for the incident which they had broadcast live. The incident was not shown on ITV in the UK who had cut away prior to the encore. Williams appeared on &quot;This Morning&quot; on 19 June and explained what happened, &quot;It was one minute to kick off, I was under a lot of pressure, because there was one minute left and I didn&#x27;t know how I was going to do half a minute, so I just did a one-minute countdown [using his middle finger].&quot; Asked by presenter Phillip Schofield whether he regrets it, he said: &quot;Yeah, of course, yeah. I cannot trust me. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do at any time. There&#x27;s no, sort of, plan. The plan was, sing in key, don&#x27;t fall over. That was the plan and 99% of the plan, I pulled off.&quot; When asked did the idea just enter his head he responded, &quot;Nothing actually pops into my head. There&#x27;s a block between me and sense... then something happens and then five minutes later, I&#x27;m like, &#x27;Did I? Yeah, I did, didn&#x27;t I?&quot;.

On 17 July 2018, Williams along with his wife, and One Direction star Louis Tomlinson, were announced as the new judges on the fifteenth series of &quot;The X Factor&quot; in the UK, joining Simon Cowell and replacing Louis Walsh, Sharon Osbourne and Nicole Scherzinger.

===2019–2023: &quot;The Christmas Present&quot; and &quot;XXV&quot;===
On 22 November, Williams released his first Christmas album, &quot;The Christmas Present&quot;, with guest appearances from boxer Tyson Fury, Rod Stewart, Jamie Cullum, Helene Fischer and Bryan Adams. It debuted at number two on the UK Charts behind Coldplay&#x27;s &quot;Everyday Life&quot;. The album sold over 67,000 copies, matching &quot;The Heavy Entertainment Show.&quot; Williams also sold over 10,000 cassettes in seven days, the most in two decades. The following week saw Williams&#x27; album go to #1 in the UK, outselling the nearest competitor, Rod Stewart, by 5,000 copies. This was Williams&#x27; 13th UK number-one album, tying Elvis Presley for the most UK number-one albums. Williams released the promotional single &quot;Hey Tiger&quot; in December 2019, for the new version of &quot;The Tiger Who Came to Tea&quot;.

On 25 February 2022, it was revealed that Williams had teamed up with his regular collaborators Tim Metcalfe and Flynn Francis to record the trance track &quot;Sway&quot; under the new alias &#x27;Lufthaus&#x27;. In April 2022, &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that while Williams &quot;remains a big draw&quot;, he was no longer guaranteed hits and was &quot;now more likely to be playlisted on Smooth Radio than BBC Radio 1&quot;. Williams said he was working on more experimental music, which he likened to David Bowie and Lou Reed, but said: &quot;Do I unashamedly want to still be one of the biggest artists in the world? Yeah, I do ... I&#x27;ve had an interesting first half of my life. I&#x27;d like an interesting second half, too.&quot; In May 2022, Williams performed at the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, Australia, during the filming of his &quot;Better Man&quot; biopic which was produced at Docklands Studios Melbourne. 

On 7 June 2022, Williams announced that his tenth compilation album, &quot;XXV&quot;, would be released on 9 September 2022. It will feature new, reimagined versions of his hit songs, plus new material. On the same day as this announcement, Williams released &quot;Angels XXV&quot;, a reworked version of &quot;Angels&quot;. On 10 June 2022, &quot;Angels (XXV)&quot; reached number 92 on the UK Official Singles Sales Chart, rising to 74 a week later. On 5 August 2022, Williams released the single &quot;Lost&quot;, also taken from &quot;XXV&quot;.
&quot;XXV&quot; was released on 9 September 2022 and debuted a week later at number 1 on the UK Official Albums Chart. In doing so, Williams broke all previous &quot;Official Chart&quot; records with his fourteenth solo number one album. On 24 September 2022, Williams performed at the 2022 AFL Grand Final held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne, Australia. Williams sang &quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot;, &quot;Rock DJ&quot;, &quot;Lost&quot; and &quot;Feel&quot; before he performed &quot;Angels&quot; which Williams dedicated to Australian cricketer Shane Warne, who had died in March 2022. Williams then covered John Farnham&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re the Voice&quot; stating &quot;The next song is the unofficial national anthem of Australia! Let&#x27;s all send our love to John and his family&quot;. Just two days prior on 22 September 2022, John Farnham had released a statement outlining that he was to undergo immediate surgery after being diagnosed with cancer. Williams then performed &quot;Kids&quot; with Australian singer Delta Goodrem.

On 7 October 2022, Lufthaus released the single &quot;Soul Seekers&quot;. Williams&#x27; XXV tour started on 9 October 2022 in The O2 Arena, supported by Lufthaus. In November 2022, Williams performed in Qatar as part of the country&#x27;s FIFA World Cup 2022 celebrations. His appearance attracted criticism due to Qatar&#x27;s human rights abuses and strict LGBT laws. After the criticism, Williams stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t condone any abuses of human rights anywhere [...] if we&#x27;re not condoning human rights abuses anywhere, then it would be the shortest tour the world has ever known: I wouldn&#x27;t even be able to perform in my own kitchen [...] Anybody leaving messages saying &#x27;no to Qatar&#x27; are doing so on Chinese technology [...] the hypocrisy there is that if we take that case in this place, we need to apply that unilaterally to the world. Then if we apply that unilaterally to the world, nobody can go anywhere.&quot;

On 5 May 2023, Williams was featured on the bilingual single &quot;Une Tahitienne á Paris&quot; by the French singer Mareva Galanter. On 21 August 2023, Williams was featured with a cameo performance on the single &quot;Punk&#x27;s Dead&quot;, by the English duo Soft Play. Lufthaus&#x27; debut album, &quot;Visions, Volume 1&quot; was released on 6 October 2023. The single &quot;Immortal&quot;, featuring Sophie Ellis-Bextor, was released the day before.

=== 2024–present: &quot;Better Man&quot; ===
On 2 May 2024, Williams was featured on the duet version of Lucy Spraggan&#x27;s 2020 single &quot;Sober&quot;. In September 2024, he featured on the track &quot;Danny&quot; with the Israeli singer Noga Erez on her album, &quot;The Vandalist&quot;. The pair previously performed together at his June 2023 concert in Tel Aviv. 

In August 2024, &quot;Better Man&quot;, a musical biopic about Williams&#x27; life, opened to acclaim at the Telluride Film Festival. It was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on 10 September 2024, and made its theatrical premiere on 26 December 2024 in Australia by Roadshow Films and in the United Kingdom by Entertainment Film Distributors. It had a limited theatrical release by Paramount Pictures in the United States on 25 December, before a wider release set for 10 January 2025. &quot;Better Man&quot; received a record-breaking 16 nominations at the 2025 AACTA Awards, winning in nine categories, including Best Film. It was a box-office failure, and performed particularly poorly in the US, where Williams is less known.

On 29 November 2024, Williams released the first single from the &quot;Better Man&quot; soundtrack, &quot;Forbidden Road&quot;; it charted at number 20 on the UK Singles Downloads Chart one week later. It was nominated for Best Original Song at the 82nd Golden Globe Awards and the 14th AACTA Awards. It was initially shortlisted for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 97th Academy Awards but was disqualified a few days later after it was found it incorporated material from another song, &quot;I Got A Name&quot;, as performed by Jim Croce. Williams was a headline performer for Australia&#x27;s nationally broadcast New Year&#x27;s Eve concert, screened annually on the ABC from in front of the Sydney Opera House. A portion of his performance from Sydney also appeared in &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot; in the United States broadcast, hosted by Ryan Seacrest. On 3 January 2025, the soundtrack album to &quot;Better Man&quot; debuted at number 1 on the UK Albums Downloads Chart, and at number 4 on the UK Soundtrack Albums Chart; on 24 January 2025, after the album was released on CD, it debuted at number 1 on the main UK Albums Chart.

Williams features in his own karaoke video game, &quot;We Sing Robbie Williams&quot;, which was released on 12 November 2010 by Nordic Games Publishing AB.

===Football===
In 2005, Williams founded a football team called Los Angeles Vale F.C. Williams formed the club with other celebrity friends after building his own soccer pitch at his home in Los Angeles. The club was named after Williams&#x27; hometown club, Port Vale, and its logo was very similar. The club was disbanded in 2007, reportedly after Williams discovered two players had swindled him out of £200,000.

In January 2024, Williams was named president of Port Vale Football Club in Stoke-on-Trent.

=== Musical theatre ===
In 2018, it was announced that Williams and Guy Chambers would write the music and lyrics (with a book by Mark Ravenhill) for the stage musical adaptation of David Walliams&#x27; children&#x27;s book &quot;The Boy in the Dress&quot; for the Royal Shakespeare Company. The musical opened in November 2019 at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon where it ran for an 18-week season, earning rave reviews from the critics and audiences.

==Influences==
During his childhood, Williams was influenced by swing musicians such as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr. The first records he listened to were released by Nat King Cole, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald and Cole Porter, which belonged to his mother. At the age of 10, he got into hip hop and started collecting electro albums; and when he started his solo career in the &#x27;90s, he was influenced by Britpop bands such as Oasis, Blur and Pulp.

As a singer, his influences include George Michael, Tom Jones, Elvis Presley and Bono. He worked with Jones several times throughout his career: They performed together at the Brit Awards in 1998; the following year, they recorded a cover of the song &quot;Are You Gonna Go My Way&quot; for Jones&#x27; album Reload; and in 2012, Williams and Jones worked together again on the song &quot;On My Own&quot;, b-side of his single &quot;Different&quot;.

Williams also feels great admiration for Freddie Mercury and Queen. In 2001, Williams, Brian May and Roger Taylor released a new version of &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; for the movie &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;. He also revealed that he was once asked to be the new frontman of Queen, but that he turned down the offer because of his &quot;very low self-esteem&quot;. He said: &quot;I just thought I&#x27;d save them the audacity of me even trying to step on a stage and be in the same echelon as Freddie Mercury. Because he, to me, is angelic. He&#x27;s godlike. It was just too scary.&quot;

Williams has revealed that he does the &quot;Elvis Prayer&quot; before going on stage at every concert. In 2000, he got a tattoo of the phrase &quot;Elvis Grant Me Serenity&quot; and he also played as an Elvis impersonator in the music video for his song &quot;Advertising Space&quot; (2005).

Speaking to BBC Radio 2 in February 2021, Williams cited Ian Dury as his biggest inspiration as a lyricist. He sings on &quot;You&#x27;re the Why&quot;, the final track of the posthumously released album &quot;Ten More Turnips from the Tip&quot; (2002).

==Legacy==

By 2008, Williams had sold more albums in the UK than any other British solo artist in history. His record sales stand at over 77 million worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time. Williams was entered in &quot;The Guinness Book of World Records&quot; when, after he announced his World Tour for 2006, 1.6 million tickets were sold in one day.

Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that Williams is &quot;a perfect meeting of ego, self-deprecation and hits&quot;, adding &quot;there really is nobody else, in pop music anyway, who combines monumental hamminess and bone-deep vulnerability quite so effectively.&quot;

Williams has won significantly more Brit Awards than any other artist, a record eighteen—Best British Male Artist four times, two awards for Outstanding Contribution to Music and the 2017 Brits Icon for his &quot;lasting impact on British culture&quot;, and eight German ECHO awards. In 2004, he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame, after being voted as the Greatest artist of the 1990s. He appeared in the 2009 edition of the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; when his sell-out show at the BBC Electric Proms at London&#x27;s Roundhouse was screened by more than 250 cinemas across 23 countries to set a new record for the most simultaneous cinematic screenings of a live concert. Williams appears in the list of the all-time Top 100 biggest selling albums in the UK six times–with four albums in the top 60.

In 2005, the British public voted &quot;Angels&quot; the song they would most like played at their funeral. In October 2009, it was announced that he would receive the Outstanding Contribution to British Music award at the 2010 Brit Awards. In September 2010, Williams switched on the Blackpool illuminations, stating that it was one of the greatest honours he had achieved. In October, Media Control named Williams the most successful album-artist of the millennium due to the fact that he had spent No. 1 on the German Albums Chart for 38 weeks since 2000. He also reached that chart&#x27;s Top Ten 135 times.

He was ranked at No. 11 the greatest frontman of all time in a reader poll by &quot;Q&quot; magazine.

===Influence on other artists===
Contemporary artists have expressed their admiration for Williams and cited him as one of their influences. The English rapper Example admitted his obsession with Williams and how he had been inspired by Williams&#x27; performances when he was younger. He described his own performance on stage as &quot;a combination of rap, rock and Robbie Williams&quot;.

Ed Sheeran, in an interview with El Hormiguero, revealed the first album he ever bought was &quot;Life Thru a Lens&quot;. Olly Murs paid tribute to Williams&#x27; &quot;Angels&quot; music video in the music video for his single &quot;Hand on Heart&quot;. One of Louis Tomlinson&#x27;s earliest influences was Williams, of whom he declared he is a big fan.

==Personal life==
===Residence===
In 2006, Williams emigrated to Los Angeles. He briefly moved back to the UK in 2009 when he bought an £8.5 million mansion in Compton Bassett, but sold the property a year later to move back to Los Angeles.

In 2016, he moved into Woodland House, a £17 million mansion in the Kensington area of London. His next-door neighbour there is Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, who has lived in The Tower House since 1972. In 2018, Page delayed Williams&#x27; plans for an underground swimming pool, stating that construction work would damage The Tower House.

In 2017, he sold his mansion in Beverly Hills to DJ Khaled for $9.9 million.

===Health issues===

Williams has reportedly battled mental illness, obesity, self-esteem issues, alcoholism, and substance abuse throughout his life. He has discussed how his friend Elton John booked him into a clinic to cope with his drug use that emerged from the depression he was experiencing while still in Take That.

Williams revealed in 2011 he had been experiencing lethargy caused by a type of hormone imbalance called andropause for a number of years, and thought at first it was a return of his depression. In a June 2020 interview with &quot;Weight Watchers Magazine&quot;, he revealed that he had developed an addiction to online golf games.

Williams also has dyslexia and dyscalculia.

===Interests===

Williams has a keen interest in UFOs and related paranormal phenomena, and researched the subject during his 2007–2008 sabbatical. He participated in a documentary for BBC Radio 4 with Jon Ronson about the paranormal. The documentary followed them to a UFO convention in Nevada, during which Williams linked his obsession in the paranormal with the desire to understand his childhood fears of his mother&#x27;s belief in &quot;the world&#x27;s mysteries, elves, demons, [and] witchcraft&quot;.

Williams featured in a 2018 TV documentary &quot;Hunt for the Skinwalker&quot; by Jeremy Corbell, and revealed that his partner Ayda Field dissuaded him from buying the Skinwalker Ranch when it became for sale.

Williams became an ordained minister with the Universal Ministries to officiate the wedding of friends.

Williams has a number of tattoos, many of which are related to British culture. These include:
* an Ace of Spades, commemorating heavy metal band Motörhead.
* a fez, common headwear of comedian Tommy Cooper.
* the logo of &quot;The Saint&quot;, tribute to Roger Moore who played the titular character on the TV show.
* the spectacles logo of &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;, the comedy sketch show of the TV double act of Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett.
* the &quot;skip dance&quot; pose of Morecambe and Wise, another TV comic double act (Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise).
* a Stafford knot, a symbol of his home county Staffordshire.
* the logo of his former group Take That.
* the coat of arms of Burslem, the town in Stoke-on-Trent where he grew up.
* the notes and words of the first line of the chorus of the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; on his lower back.

Williams became a fan of his hometown football team Port Vale FC as a child after his father became the licensee of the team&#x27;s social club. He has played in a testimonial match for club legend Neil Aspin and helped to design the playing strip for the 2020–21 season. He is also a supporter of the Carlton Football Club in the Australian Football League.

In 2020, Williams received backlash for defending the widely debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory.

At a February 2025 auction of memorabilia and personal items, belonging to Eric Morecambe, long-time fan Williams bought his distinctive imitation tortoiseshell Metzler spectacles and pipe for £20,000, much more than their £2,000 to £4,000 estimate.

===Relationships and fatherhood===

In 1997, Williams was in a month-long relationship with Spice Girls singer Melanie Chisholm; also in 2000, Williams was in a short-term relationship with Geri Halliwell, another member of Spice Girls.

In December 1997, he met All Saints singer Nicole Appleton while filming &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. The following year, they started a on-and-off relationship, and at one point got engaged. In an autobiography she co-authored with her sister Natalie titled &quot;Together&quot;, Appleton revealed that she terminated the pregnancy of her and Williams&#x27; baby after pressure from her record company, causing an immense emotional strain on their relationship. They broke up by 1999. Williams would state in later interviews that he was ashamed of his actions during their relationship, citing himself as a &quot;fucking awful boyfriend&quot; [to Appleton]. Their relationship was portrayed heavily in the 2024 biopic &quot;Better Man&quot;.

In May 2006, Williams started dating American actress Ayda Field. She was featured in the UFO documentary that Williams did for BBC Radio 4 and took part in a field investigation he did in Trout Lake, Washington, in 2008. Williams and Field wed at his home in Mulholland Estates in Beverly Hills on 7 August 2010. They have four children: daughters Theodora and Colette, and sons Charlton and Beau. Williams&#x27;s wife is Ashkenazi Jewish. Williams considers his children to be Jewish.

There have been questions about Williams&#x27;s sexuality, with some speculating that he may be bisexual.

===Wealth===
In the 2011 &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; of wealthiest people in the British music industry, his wealth was estimated at £90 million. Williams is a lifelong supporter of football club Port Vale, based in his home town of Stoke-on-Trent, and in February 2006 he bought £240,000 worth of shares in the club, making him the largest shareholder. However, the club entered administration on 9 March 2012, and as a result Williams lost all of his shares in the club and received only a fraction of his original investment back.

===Charity===

Williams has set up a charity in his home town of Stoke-on-Trent entitled &quot;Give It Sum&quot;, its goal being to &quot;improve local conditions and strengthen community life by giving money to those who are disadvantaged.&quot;

Williams, with the help of friend Jonathan Wilkes, has organised charity football matches called Soccer Aid to raise money for UNICEF UK. A mixture of non-football celebrities and professional football players have played Soccer Aid matches in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 at Old Trafford, and Etihad Stadium in Manchester and Wembley Stadium, Stamford Bridge, and the London Stadium in London.

Williams has been the Patron of the children&#x27;s charity the Donna Louise Trust, based in Stoke-on-Trent, since 2002. The charity offers respite and palliative care to terminally ill and life-limited children who are not expected to live past the age of 16.

==Awards and nominations==

Williams has won various awards, with some of his more recognised accolades being the Brit Awards. He has won a record eighteen Brit Awards, which also include the Brits he won with Take That, making him the most successful artist in the history of the awards. He has also won 8 Echo Awards from the German music industry.

<doc id="39011" wikidata="Q1127209" url="?curid=39011" title="Labial consonant">
<text>Labial consonants are consonants in which one or both lips are the active articulator. The two common labial articulations are bilabials, articulated using both lips, and labiodentals, articulated with the lower lip against the upper teeth, both of which are present in English. A third labial articulation is dentolabials, articulated with the upper lip against the lower teeth (the reverse of labiodental), normally only found in pathological speech. Generally precluded are linguolabials, in which the tip of the tongue contacts the posterior side of the upper lip, making them coronals, though sometimes, they behave as labial consonants.

The most common distribution between bilabials and labiodentals is the English one, in which the nasal and the stops, , , and , are bilabial and the fricatives, , and , are labiodental. The voiceless bilabial fricative, voiced bilabial fricative, and the bilabial approximant do not exist as the primary realizations of any sounds in English, but they occur in many languages. For example, the Spanish consonant written &quot;b&quot; or &quot;v&quot; is pronounced, between vowels, as a voiced bilabial approximant.

Lip rounding, or labialization, is a common approximant-like co-articulatory feature. English is a voiced labialized velar approximant, which is far more common than the purely labial approximant [β̞]. In the languages of the Caucasus, labialized dorsals like /kʷ/ and /qʷ/ are very common.

Very few languages, however, make a distinction purely between bilabials and labiodentals, making &quot;labial&quot; usually a sufficient specification of a language&#x27;s phonemes. One exception is Ewe, which has both kinds of fricatives, but the labiodentals are produced with greater articulatory force.

==Lack of labials==
While most languages make use of purely labial phonemes, a few generally lack them. Examples are Tlingit, Eyak (both Na-Dené), Wichita (Caddoan), and the Iroquoian languages except Cherokee.

Many of these languages are transcribed with and with labialized consonants. However, it is not always clear to what extent the lips are involved in such sounds. In the Iroquoian languages, for example, involved little apparent rounding of the lips. See the Tillamook language for an example of a language with &quot;rounded&quot; consonants and vowels that do not have any actual labialization. All of these languages have seen labials introduced under the influence of English.

<text>Coronals, previously called point-and-blade consonants, are consonants articulated with the flexible front part of the tongue. Among places of articulation, only the coronal consonants can be divided into as many articulation types: apical (using the tip of the tongue), laminal (using the blade of the tongue), domed (with the tongue bunched up), or subapical (using the underside of the tongue) as well as different postalveolar articulations (some of which also involve the back of the tongue as an articulator): palato-alveolar, alveolo-palatal and retroflex. Only the front of the tongue (coronal) has such dexterity among the major places of articulation, allowing such variety of distinctions. Coronals have another dimension, grooved, to make sibilants in combination with the orientations above.

==Places of articulation==
Coronal places of articulation include the dental consonants at the upper teeth, the alveolar consonants at the upper gum (the alveolar ridge), the various postalveolar consonants (including domed palato-alveolar, laminal alveolo-palatal, and apical retroflex) just behind that, the subapical retroflex consonants curled back against the hard palate, and linguolabial consonants with the tongue against the upper lip. Alveolo-palatal and linguolabial consonants sometimes behave as dorsal and labial consonants, respectively, rather than as coronals.

==Examples==
===Arabic===
In Arabic and Maltese philology, the sun letters represent coronal consonants.

===European===
===Australian Aboriginal===
In Australian Aboriginal languages, coronals contrast with peripheral consonants.

<doc id="39014" wikidata="Q509891" url="?curid=39014" title="Harry R. Truman">
<text>Harry R. Truman (October 1896 – May 18, 1980) was an American businessman, bootlegger, and prospector. He
lived near Mount St. Helens, an active volcano in the state of Washington, and was the owner and caretaker of Mount St. Helens Lodge at Spirit Lake near the base of the mountain. Truman came to fame as a folk hero in the weeks leading up to the volcano&#x27;s 1980 eruption after refusing to leave his home despite evacuation orders. He was killed by a pyroclastic flow that overtook his lodge and buried the site under of volcanic debris.

After Truman&#x27;s death, his family and friends reflected on his love for the mountain. In 1981, Art Carney portrayed Truman in the docudrama film &quot;St. Helens&quot;. He was commemorated in a book by his niece, and also in various pieces of music, including songs by Headgear, Billy Jonas, and Shawn Wright and the Brothers Band.

==Early life==
Truman was born to foresters in Ivydale, West Virginia in October, 1896. He claimed not to know the exact day of his birth but he eventually chose to celebrate his birthday on the 30th of the month. This date appears on his World War 1 draft registration card. Truman also stated that he did not know his middle name, only the initial, R; some noncontemporaneous sources have given his middle name as Randall. His draft card lists his middle name as Rainel.

In 1907, Truman&#x27;s family moved west to the state of Washington, drawn to the promise of cheap land and the successful timber industry in the Pacific Northwest; they at first settled in Napavine, then moved to the little town of Nesika in eastern Lewis County, where the family purchased of farmland.

== Career ==
Truman attended high school in the city of Mossyrock, Washington, then enlisted in the U.S. Army as a private in August, 1917. He was assigned to the 100th Aero Squadron, 7th Squad, and trained as an aeromechanic. He served in France during World War I. While en route to Europe, his troopship, &quot;Tuscania&quot;, was sunk by a German U-boat in a torpedo attack off the coast of Ireland.

During his service, he reportedly sustained injuries due to his audacious and independent nature. However, according to Washington State Archives, Truman served overseas from January 24, 1918, until February 1, 1919, but this record states he was not 
wounded or injured in action and did not participate in any engagements. The record also states he had a disability rating of zero at the time of his discharge.

Truman was honorably discharged on June 12, 1919, and he began prospecting, but failed to achieve his goal of becoming rich. He later became a bootlegger, smuggling alcohol from San Francisco to Washington during the Prohibition era.

Truman returned to Chehalis, Washington, in 1919, where he worked as an automobile mechanic and ran a service station called Harry&#x27;s Sudden Service. He married Helen Hughes, the daughter of a sawmill owner; they had one daughter, born in 1922.
In the mid 1920s, Truman leased from the Northern Pacific Railway overlooking Spirit Lake in the wilderness near Mount St. Helens, a stratovolcano of the Cascade Range located in Skamania County, Washington. He settled near the base of the mountain and opened a gas station and a small grocery store; he eventually opened the Mount St. Helens Lodge, close to the outlet of Spirit Lake , which he operated for 52 years.
During the 1930s, Truman divorced his first wife; he remarried in 1935. The second marriage was short, as he reportedly attempted to win arguments by throwing his wife into Spirit Lake, despite her inability to swim. He began dating a local girl, though he eventually married the girl&#x27;s sister Edna, whom he called Edie. This third marriage held, and he and Edna operated the Mount St. Helens Lodge together until her death from a heart attack in 1975.

In the Mount St. Helens area, Truman became notorious for his antics, once getting a forest ranger drunk so that he could burn a pile of brush. He poached, stole gravel from the U.S. Forest Service, and fished on American Indian land with a fake game warden badge. Despite their knowledge of these criminal activities, local rangers failed to catch him in the act. When the Washington state government changed the state sales tax, Truman kept charging the old rate at his lodge. A tax agency employee rented a boat from him, but refused to pay his tax rate, so Truman pushed him into Spirit Lake.

Truman was a fan of the cocktail drink Whiskey and Coke made with Schenley whiskey and Coca-Cola. He owned a pink 1957 Cadillac, and he swore frequently. He loved discussing politics and reportedly hated Republicans, hippies, young children, and the elderly. In 1953, Truman refused to allow Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas to stay at his lodge, dismissing him as an &quot;old coot&quot;. When he learned who Douglas was, he realized his mistake and chased the Justice for , to a neighboring lodge and convinced him to return; Truman and Douglas became friends and drinking buddies for the rest of their lives. After his wife Edna died in September 1975, Truman lost interest in running his lodge which began to fall into disrepair. He rented only a limited number of cabins and boats during the summer months, became even more irascible and his drinking increased.

==Celebrity==
Although Truman was already well-known by locals for his various antics, he became an even bigger celebrity during the two months of volcanic activity preceding the eruption of Mount St. Helens in May, 1980. Truman gave several interviews to reporters and expressed his opinion that the danger of a volcanic eruption was exaggerated. &quot;I don&#x27;t have any idea whether it will blow,&quot; he said, &quot;but I don&#x27;t believe it to the point that I&#x27;m going to pack up.&quot; Truman displayed little concern about the volcano and his situation: &quot;If the mountain goes, I&#x27;m going with it. This area is heavily timbered, Spirit Lake is in between me and the mountain, and the mountain is a mile away, the mountain ain&#x27;t gonna hurt me.&quot; Law enforcement and Forest Service officials were frustrated by his refusal to evacuate because the media continued to enter the volcano&#x27;s restricted zone to interview him and endangered themselves in the process. Still, Truman remained steadfast. &quot;You couldn&#x27;t pull me out with a mule team. That mountain&#x27;s part of Truman and Truman&#x27;s part of that mountain.&quot;

Truman told reporters that he was knocked from his bed by precursor earthquakes, so he responded by moving his bed to the basement. He claimed to wear spurs to bed to cope with the earthquakes while he slept. He scoffed at the public&#x27;s concern for his safety, responding to scientists&#x27; claims about the threat of the volcano that &quot;the mountain has shot its wad and it hasn&#x27;t hurt my place a bit, but those goddamn geologists with their hair down to their butts wouldn&#x27;t pay no attention to ol&#x27; Truman.&quot;

As a result of his defiant commentary, Truman became something of a folk hero, and was the subject of many songs and poems by children. One group of school children from Salem, Oregon, sent him banners inscribed &quot;Harry – We Love You&quot;, which moved him so much that he took a helicopter trip (arranged and paid for by &quot;National Geographic&quot;) to visit them on May 14. He also received many fan letters, including several marriage proposals. A group of fifth graders from Grand Blanc, Michigan, wrote letters that brought him to tears. In return, he sent them a letter and volcanic ash, which the children later sold to send flowers to his family after the eruption.

Truman caused a media frenzy, appearing on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; and attracting the attention of &quot;National Geographic&quot;, United Press International, and &quot;The Today Show&quot;. Many major magazines composed profiles, including &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Field &amp; Stream&quot;, and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. A historian named Richard W. Slatta wrote that &quot;his fiery attitude, brash speech, love of the outdoors, and fierce independence… made him a folk hero the media could adore.&quot; Slatta pointed to Truman&#x27;s &quot;unbendable character and response to the forces of nature&quot; as a source of his rise to fame, and the interviews with him added &quot;color&quot; to reports about the events at Mount St. Helens. Truman was immortalized, according to Slatta, &quot;with many of the embellished qualities of the western hero&quot;, and the media spotlight created a persona that was &quot;in some ways quite different from his true character.&quot;

==Death==
As the likelihood of a major eruption increased, state officials ordered an evacuation of the area with the exception of a few scientists and security officials. On Saturday, May 17, local law enforcement made one final attempt to persuade Truman to leave his home, to no avail. On Sunday morning, May 18, at 8:32, Mount St. Helens erupted, collapsing the entire northern flank of the mountain. Truman and his 16 cats were all presumed to have died in the eruption. All likely died of heat shock in less than a second, too quickly to register pain. 

The largest landslide in recorded history and a pyroclastic flow traveling atop the landslide engulfed the Spirit Lake area almost simultaneously, destroying the lake and burying the site of Truman&#x27;s lodge under of volcanic landslide debris. Authorities never searched for Truman&#x27;s remains. Truman considered his cats family and mentioned them in almost all public statements.

Friends hoped that Truman might have survived, as he had claimed to have provisioned an abandoned mine shaft with food and liquor in case of an eruption, but the lack of any immediate warning of the eruption would almost certainly have prevented him from escaping to the shaft before the pyroclastic flow reached his lodge (less than a minute after the eruption began). Even if Truman had made it there, the landslide would have made any rescue impossible. Truman&#x27;s sister, Geraldine, said that she found it hard to accept the reality of his death. &quot;I don&#x27;t think he made it, but I thought if they would let me fly over and see for myself that Harry&#x27;s lodge is gone, then maybe I&#x27;d believe it for sure.&quot; 

Truman&#x27;s niece Shirley Rosen added that her uncle thought he could escape the volcano but was not expecting the lateral eruption. She stated that her sister took him a bottle of bourbon whiskey to persuade him to evacuate, but he was too afraid to drink alcohol at the time because he was unsure whether the shaking was coming from his body or the earthquakes. Truman owned a second home located between Washougal and Stevenson, Washington and his possessions were auctioned off there as keepsakes to admirers in September, 1980.

==Legacy==
Truman emerged as a folk hero for his resistance to the evacuation efforts. &quot;The Columbian&quot; wrote: &quot;With his 10-dollar name and hell-no-I-won&#x27;t-go attitude, Truman was a made-for-prime-time folk hero.&quot; His friends and family commented: &quot;He was a very opinionated person.&quot; Truman&#x27;s friend John Garrity added, &quot;The mountain and the lake were his life. If he&#x27;d left and then saw what the mountain did to his lake, it would have killed him anyway. He always said he wanted to die at Spirit Lake. He went the way he wanted to go.&quot; 

Truman&#x27;s niece Shirley stated, &quot;He used to say that&#x27;s my mountain and my lake and he would say those are my arms and my legs. If he would have seen it the way it is now, I don&#x27;t think he would have survived.&quot; Truman&#x27;s cousin Richard Ice commented that Truman&#x27;s short period as a celebrity was &quot;the peak of his life.&quot;

Truman was the subject of the books &quot;Truman of St. Helens: The Man and His Mountain&quot; by his niece Shirley Rosen, and &quot;The Legend of Harry Truman&quot; by his sister Geri Whiting. He was portrayed by Art Carney, his favorite actor, in the 1981 docudrama &quot;St. Helens&quot;. Memorabilia were sold in the area surrounding Mount St. Helens, including Harry Truman hats, pictures, posters, and postcards. A restaurant opened in Anchorage, Alaska, named after him, serving dishes such as Harry&#x27;s Hot Molten Chili. 

According to &quot;The Washington Star&quot;, more than 100 songs had been composed in Truman&#x27;s honor by 1981, in addition to a commemorative album titled &quot;The Musical Legend Of Harry Truman — A Very Special Collection Of Mount St. Helens’ Volcano Songs&quot;. Lula Belle Garland wrote &quot;The Legend of Harry And The Mountain,&quot; which was recorded in 1980 by Ron Shaw &amp; The Desert Wind Band. Musicians Ron Allen and Steve Asplund wrote a country rock song in 1980 called &quot;Harry Truman, Your Spirit Still Lives On&quot;. One of the major characters from the first two seasons of TV show &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990-91) was named Sheriff Harry S. Truman in his honor. Billy Jonas included Truman&#x27;s narrative in his song &quot;Old St. Helen&quot; in 1993. He is the subject of the 2007 song &quot;Harry Truman&quot; written and recorded by Irish band Headgear.

Truman Trail and Harry&#x27;s Ridge in the Mount St. Helens region are named after him. The Harry R. Truman Memorial Park was named in his honor in Castle Rock, Washington, though it later was renamed Castle Rock Lions Club Volunteer Park.

<text>Henry Probus (Latin for the Righteous; or &quot;Prawy&quot;; ;  – 23 June 1290) was a member of the Silesian branch of the royal Polish Piast dynasty. He was Duke of Silesia at Wrocław from 1266 as well as the ruler of the Seniorate Province of Kraków and High Duke of Poland from 1288 until his death in 1290.

==Life==
Henry IV was the only son of Duke Henry III the White of Silesia-Wrocław by his first wife Judith, daughter of Duke Konrad I of Masovia.

===Early life and tutelage===
A minor upon the early death of his father in 1266, Henry IV was placed under the guardianship of his paternal uncle, Archbishop Władysław of Salzburg. The Archbishop decided that the constant travels between Wrocław and Salzburg were inappropriate for a child, and, in 1267, sent Henry to Prague to be raised at the court of King Ottokar II of Bohemia. Ottokar after Władysław&#x27;s death in 1270 also took over Wrocław.

Shortly after the death of his uncle (who left him as his universal heir), Henry IV returned to Wrocław, where he found himself under the direct care of one of the closest advisers of his late father, Simon Gallicusa. Henry IV received a careful education, which may explain his subsequent interest in culture and poetry (there are reasonable suspicions that the Duke had asperger syndrome). The cooperation between Henry IV and King Ottokar II was exemplary. In 1271 Henry IV participated in an armed expedition against Hungary, which brought an attack on Wrocław by the Árpád princes and their allies, the Dukes of Greater and Lesser Poland.

In 1273 Henry IV was formally proclaimed an adult and by himself assumed the government of his Silesian Duchy of Wrocław, which, however, after the split between Opole, Legnica and Głogów only comprised the eastern part of the Lower Silesian lands. He began to follow a policy which was more independent from Bohemia, including in respect to friendly relations with his Upper Silesian cousin Duke Władysław of Opole and also with duke Przemysł II of Greater Poland.

===Kidnapping of Henry IV by Bolesław II the Bald===
Henry supported King Ottokar II in his fierce conflict with King Rudolph I of Germany in 1276, giving food and refuge to the Bohemian troops. When Ottokar was placed under the Imperial ban, Duke Bolesław II the Bald of Legnica took the occasion, had his nephew Henry seized at Jelcz and imprisoned him in 1277.

Fortunately for Henry IV, the reaction to his imprisonment was indignation. Ottokar&#x27;s Polish allies, Duke Henry III of Głogów and Duke Przemysł II of Greater Poland attempted to enforce Henry IV&#x27;s liberation. The Bohemian king however only sent febrile appeals and request for release. Henry IV&#x27;s allies were defeated by Duke Bolesław II &#x27;s son Henry V the Fat in the bloody Battle of Stolec (24 April 1277), where both Dukes Przemysł II and Henry III were captured.

Henry IV could obtain his freedom only at the end of the year, when he finally decided to capitulate after hearing the defeat of his main ally King Ottokar II against the Imperial and Hungarian troops at the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld. Henry IV was forced to give Bolesław II one-third of his duchy including the towns of Środa Śląska and Strzegom and forced to pledge Krosno Odrzańskie, which he had obtained from the Dukes of Głogów in 1273–1274, in order to obtain the money for his ransom.

===Ottokar II&#x27;s death and Regency of Bohemia===
While Henry himself did not take part in the Battle on the Marchfeld, he had sent reinforcements to King Ottokar II, whose death was a serious blow to the Wrocław duke. After hearing the news of Ottokar&#x27;s death, Henry IV went to Prague and attempted to gain the guardianship of the king&#x27;s son Wenceslaus II, as one of his closest relatives (Henry IV&#x27;s paternal grandmother was Anna of Bohemia, a daughter of late King Ottokar I) and ally.

He was however not successful due to the actions of King Rudolph I of Germany, who in his capacity as King of the Romans had given the regency over Bohemia to the Ascanian margrave Otto V, Margrave of Brandenburg-Salzwedel. As compensation, the German king gave Henry IV the Bohemian County of Kladsko as a fief.

===Homage to King Rudolph I in 1280===
Upon the death of his Bohemian ally, Henry IV reconciled with King Rudolph I and in 1280 went to his Austrian court in Vienna, where Henry tried to obtain for himself the Polish royal crown.

Some historians believed that the Duke of Wrocław took the opportunity from his homage to King Rudolph I to expose him the possibility of becoming King of Poland. At that time, he also made an alliance with Duke Władysław of Opole, who promised to help Henry IV with the condition that his daughter (perhaps called Constance), who had recently married Henry IV, was crowned with him as Polish queen if he would obtain the royal investiture.
===Attempts at authority over Silesia and Poland===
The relation of Henry IV with his Silesian relatives, in general, was not good. In 1280 he again suffered the invasion of the Duke Henry V the Fat of Legnica, who was supported by the Margrave of Brandenburg, who could resist with unusual difficulty.

In order to normalize the situation in February of the next year Henry IV organized a meeting in Sądowel, a village located in the Duchy of Wrocław, for the purpose to find ways of mutual cooperation between the Silesian dukes. Henry IV, however, had other plans: immediately he captured his long-time enemy, Duke Henry V the Fat of Legnica, as well as his own allies, Dukes Henry III of Głogów and Przemysł II of Greater Poland, in order to obtain political concessions from them.

Przemysł II was forced to give the strategic Lesser Polish land of Wieluń (also known as Ruda) and to acknowledge Henry IV&#x27;s overlordship, paying homage to him. In subsequent years, the good politics of Henry IV were reflected in the voluntary submission of the Silesian dukes Przemko of Ścinawa and Bolko I of Opole; the re-unification of Silesia seemed within reach.

However, not all the Silesian dukes accepted his authority: Dukes Bolko I the Strict, Konrad II the Hunchback and three of the four sons of Władysław of Opole: Casimir of Bytom, Mieszko I of Cieszyn and Przemysław of Racibórz were completely against Henry&#x27;s politics. With the Opole Dukes, the situation was more delicate: in 1287, Henry IV obtained the annulment of his marriage with their sister, who was sent back to her homeland. The fourth of Władysław&#x27;s sons, Bolko I, remained faithful to Henry IV&#x27;s politics.

The first attempt of Henry IV to take the Seniorate Province at Kraków was during 1280–1281, as a response to the invasion which the Polish High Duke Leszek II the Black had made against Wrocław before. However, this trip ended unsuccessfully.

===Conflict with Bishop Thomas II of Wrocław===
In the years 1282–1287 Henry IV was involved in a long-lasting dispute with the Bishop of Wrocław Tomas II Zaremba. The first phase of the conflict was already noted in the years 1274–1276, concluded with arbitration which was not satisfied any of the parts. The disputes erupted again in 1282; this time, the conflict was for the lands and properties seized by the church in a difficult period that followed after the Battle of Legnica, and for the violation of the immunity of the Church hierarchy in trials.

At the beginning of 1282, the Bishop sent their complaint to the Papal Legate Philip of Ferno, which was to address the settlement of the dispute. His ruling was favorable to the Church hierarchy, and Henry IV appealed. In 1283 Henry IV organized a big Episcopal convention in Nysa, whose main attraction was a knight&#x27;s tournament. However, the tensions continued and Thomas II, using the support of the Papal Legate, and wanting to break the rebelliousness of Henry IV he excommunicated him and the whole Duchy in March 1284. However, the Duke of Wrocław refused to subject to the Bishop&#x27;s will and in the same year appealed to Pope Martin IV. It soon became clear, of course, that he could not expect a positive message from Rome. Despite Thomas II&#x27;s efforts to subordinate the local clergy under his rule, several religious Orders remained faithful to Henry IV, among others, the Franciscans. The conflict continued, even after the unsuccessful attempts for mediation by the Archbishop of Gniezno, Jakub Świnka.

In 1285 Henry IV took advantage of his power over the clergy and confiscated some lands which belonged to the bishopric Duchy of Nysa–Otmuchów. The humiliated Bishop Thomas II was forced to emigrate to the Duchy of Racibórz. The last act of the dispute took place in 1287 when Henry IV entered Racibórz. Thomas II was no longer able to escape and finally decided to subordinate to the Duke of Wrocław. But Henry IV was generous in his triumph: he restored the rich lands obtained earlier from the Bishopric and also founded a Kolegiata consecrated to the Holy Cross.

Meanwhile, in foreign politics, Henry IV continued to try to obtain the subordination of the other Silesian Dukes, which indirectly could bring him the Royal Crown. In 1284 he used the betrayal of the Greater Poland noble family of Zaremba (Thomas II&#x27;s family) as a pretext to capture the town of Kalisz. It soon became clear that the Dukes of Greater Poland never accepted this loss, so after some discussions, Kalisz was exchanged with the town of Ołobok by Duke Przemysł II.

===Henry IV, High Duke of Poland===
On 30 September 1288, Leszek II the Black, Duke of Sieradz and High Duke of Poland, died without issue. This event opened an opportunity for Henry IV to realize his ambitious plans to gain Kraków and the title of High Duke. With this purpose, he began to find suitable allies from 1287, when he reconciled with Przemysł II, returning him Wieluń. According to the Professor and Historian Oswald Balzer, shortly before began the preparations to the First Coalition of Piast Dukes formed by Leszek II the Black, Henry IV, Przemysł II and Henry III of Głogow, which had the intention to make the unification of Poland. Notwithstanding the veracity of this theory, after hearing the news of Leszek II&#x27;s death, Henry IV was ready for action.

Henry IV&#x27;s major contenders for the Kraków throne were Leszek II&#x27;s half-brother Władysław I the Elbow-high and Duke Bolesław II of Płock, who counted on the support of the Lesser Poland nobility. However, the Duke of Płock failed to obtain the decisive support of the Castellan Sulk the Bear (&quot;Sułk z Niedźwiedzia&quot;), who was the Governor of the city. On 26 February 1289, the bloody Battle of Siewierz took place between the troops of the Dukes of Płock and Kuyavia, and Henry IV&#x27;s troops, supported by King Rudolph I and the Dukes of Opole, Głogów and Ścinawa (Steinau). The battle ended with a victory for the Masovia-Kuyavia coalition; from two of Henry IV&#x27;s allies, Duke Przemko of Ścinawa was killed in the battle, and Duke Bolko I of Opole was seriously injured and captured by Władysław I the Elbow-high.

Despite this success, Duke Bolesław II of Płock unexpectedly resigned his pretensions, leaving all the Kraków inheritance to Wladyslaw I the Elbow-high. As the war turned favorable to him, Wladyslaw I, with the assistance of the Bishop of Kraków, Paul of Półkozic (who was later imprisoned after rebelled against him), managed to besiege and capture Wawel castle and forced the Silesian troops to retreat to Skała.

However, Henry IV regrouped his forces and marched against Kraków in person at the head of his army in August 1289. Thanks to the betrayal of the Kraków townspeople and the help of the Franciscans (who even hid him in their monastery), Henry IV took the city and was recognized as High Duke. Despite his victory, Henry IV decided to remain in Sandomierz.
===Internal politics===
During his reign, Henry succeeded in strengthening central power across his duchy, as well as improving its economy. He supported progress of mining and cities, many of which received German city law and various privileges. He was also an educated man, fluently spoke several languages and actively supported Western court culture and chivalric ethos. Henry himself was a talented poet; two of his poems were recorded in Codex Manesse.

==Death==
Henry IV died suddenly in 1290, aged no more than thirty-two years. The details of his death, given by the chronicler Ottokar of Styria, are seen by some historians as very reliable and by others as doubtful.

The year of his death is widely accepted, and confirmation for this can be found in numerous sources. However, the exact day was variously given by the sources.

One, the most supported by far of the largest number of sources, and given by the Church of St. John the Baptist, was 23 June. There are, however, other proposals: 24 June, 22 July, and even in April.

===Poisoning===
About the real cause of Henry IV&#x27;s death, there are several independent sources: these are the tombs of the Silesian Dukes, the Chronicle of Jan Długosz, and later chroniclers, like the Bohemian Chronicle of Pulkawy and the Chronicle of Ottokar of Styria.

According to Ottokar of Styria, who seems to be the most accurate in details, Henry IV aspired to the title of the King of Poland, asking the Pope for permission for a coronation. The negotiations were successful, and he sent to Rome 12,000 &quot;grzywnas&quot; as a present to the Pope. But when the envoy reached Italy it was noted that 400 &quot;grzywnas&quot; were stolen during the trip, and the Pope, infuriated, cancelled all negotiations with Henry IV. Although the embezzler was able to escape from the papal fury and the justice of the Doge of Venice, it is known that Henry IV wanted to punish him. In order to prevent the imminent revenge of the Duke it was decided to get rid of him: a false lawyer (brother of one of the Duke&#x27;s doctors) was employed at the court of Wrocław, and slowly poisoned Henry IV. While another doctor, called Guncelin, recognizing the symptoms of poisoning, was able to rescue the Duke from an imminent death, causing severe vomiting and cleansing the body; but the assassin was not discovered, and this time put the poison in the knife used by Henry IV to cut his bread. The poison was finally detected, but it was too late to save the Duke. Henry IV died in the Catholic faith, deciding not to prosecute or punish his killers.

This is a very long story of the Duke&#x27;s death and only some elements are confirmed by other sources. Ottokar of Styria told the story in many details in agreement with that provided by the &quot;Kronika Zbrasławska&quot;. Other sources related that a chaplain named Aleksy, as a deputy of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia had betrayed Henry IV&#x27;s interests and tried to give the crown to the &quot;King of Kalisz&quot; Przemysł II. In this story the theft of the envoy to Rome was also mentioned, only the epilogue was a little different: here, the thief was killed by his own servants in the streets of Rome.

===Killers===
Following the version of Ottokar of Styria, should be sought among the Wrocław townspeople (just like Henry IV&#x27;s father) two brothers, one of them was lawyer and the other doctor. The only two persons who could be identified as the brothers were John (who was an adviser of the Duchy and a lawyer) and Jakob (known as &quot;Magister&quot;, so probably a doctor), sons of one Goćwina, who was a doctor in the court of Henry III the White. They still in their posts at the time of Henry IV&#x27;s death. It&#x27;s assumed that they acted on behalf of Henry V the Fat, who wanted to obtain Kraków and with this the title of High Duke, but was not any evidence to support this. There is no other person who will take advantage of the Duke&#x27;s death, and could be linked to the circumstances of the death of Henry IV.

===Henry IV&#x27;s testament===
According to the chroniclers, the dying Henry IV made two documents. One to the Wrocław church (which give the desired permissions to the Bishop to obtain the full sovereignty over the Duchy of Nysa–Otmuchów) and other politic (who regulated the issue of his inheritance). Under this will, he bequeathed the Duchy of Wrocław to Duke Henry III of Głogów, and Kraków -with the title of High Duke- to Przemysł II. In case of the death of one of the princes, the other could take possession over his districts, which further arrangements according to custom. Many historians, however, believed the existence of a third document. If it was true, this would be a step towards the reunification of Poland, and Henry IV, who was denigrated particularly in the earlier literature, was really a conscious promoter of Poland interests and a true patriot (apart from the merits of raising the awareness of the problems of ethnic and linguistic diversity in the Middle Ages). Only the testament to the Church (who was not count with the return of Kłodzko to King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia as an excuse for mixing in the Silesian affairs) was fully implemented. Henry IV was buried in the Kolegiata of the Holy Cross and St. Bartholomeus in Wrocław, which he founded.

Henry V the Fat could take Wrocław with support of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, after the local nobility refused to accept the rule of Henry III of Głogów. Wenceslaus II himself gained the Seniorate Province, but Duke Przemysł II could retain the title of High Duke.

During World War II German anthropologists wanted to prove the &quot;Germanic look&quot; of Henry IV. To this end, his remains were removed and were to be tested. Unfortunately, they were lost during the war. The sarcophagus is now in the National Museum in Wrocław.

==Marriages==
Around March 1280, Henry IV married firstly with the daughter of Duke Władysław of Opole (b. ca. 1256/65? – d. 1287/88?), perhaps called Constance. After almost seven years of childless union, the Duke of Wrocław obtain the annulment of his marriage under the grounds of sterility, although this fact is disputed by modern historians.

By 1288, Henry IV married secondly with Matilda (b. ca. 1270 – d. bef. 1 June 1298), daughter of Margrave Otto V &quot;the Tall&quot; of Brandenburg–Salzwedel. The Professor and historian Ewa Maleczyńska alleged that the real reason of the divorce of Henry IV was that he maintain an affair with Matilda and wanted to marry her. They had no children.

<text>The Daytona 500 is a NASCAR Cup Series motor race held annually at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. It is the first of two Cup races held every year at Daytona, the second being the Coke Zero Sugar 400, and one of three held in Florida, with the annual fall showdown Straight Talk Wireless 400 being held at Homestead south of Miami. From 1988 to 2019, it was one of the four restrictor plate races on the Cup schedule. The inaugural Daytona 500 was held in 1959 coinciding with the opening of the speedway and since 1982, it has been the season-opening race of the Cup series.

The Daytona 500 is regarded as the most important and prestigious race on the NASCAR calendar, carrying by far the largest purse. Championship points awarded are equal to that of any other NASCAR Cup Series race. It is also the series&#x27; first race of the year; this phenomenon is unique in sports, which tend to have championships or other major events at the end of the season rather than the start. From 1995–2020, U.S. television ratings for the Daytona 500 were the highest for any auto race of the year, surpassing the traditional leader, the Indianapolis 500 which in turn greatly surpasses the Daytona 500 in gate attendance and international viewing. In 2021 the Indianapolis 500 surpassed the Daytona 500 in TV ratings and viewership. The 2006 Daytona 500 attracted the sixth largest average live global TV audience of any sporting event that year with 20 million viewers.

The race serves as the final event of Speedweeks and is also known as &quot;The Great American Race&quot; or the &quot;Super Bowl of Stock Car Racing&quot;. Since its inception, the race has been held in mid-to-late February. From 1971 to 2011, and again since 2018, the event has been as associated with Presidents Day weekend, taking place on the third Sunday of February and since 2022, it was held on the same day that the NBA All-Star Game was held and one week after the Super Bowl. On eight occasions, the race has been run on Valentine&#x27;s Day.

Since 1997, the winner of the Daytona 500 has been presented with the Harley J. Earl Trophy in Victory Lane, and the winning car is displayed in race-winning condition for one year at Daytona 500 Experience, a museum and gallery adjacent to Daytona International Speedway.

==Origins==

The race is the direct successor of shorter races held on the Daytona Beach Road Course. This long square was partially on the sand and also on the highway near the beach. Earlier events featured races with stock cars. A stock car race was held at Daytona International Speedway in 1959. It was the second 500-mile NASCAR race, following the annual Southern 500, and has been held every year since. By 1961, it began to be referred to as the Daytona 500, by which it is still commonly known.

Daytona International Speedway is long and a 500-mile race requires 200 laps to complete. However, the race was considered official after halfway (100 laps/250 miles) had been completed from 1959 to 2016. From 2017 to 2019, the race was considered official after the conclusion of Stage 2 (120 laps/300 miles) when stage-racing was introduced. In 2020, they revised the rule in which a race is considered official at either halfway or the conclusion of Stage 2 (whichever comes first, in this case halfway). The race has been shortened four times due to rain (in 1965, 1966, 2003, and 2009) and once in response to the energy crisis of 1974. Since the adaptation of the green–white–checkered finish rule in 2004, the race has gone past 500 miles on ten occasions (2005, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2023). It took two attempts to finish the race in 2010, 2011, and 2020. The 2023 running is the longest Daytona 500 contested, lasting 212 laps/530 miles.

William Byron is the two-time defending winner.

==History highlights==
* 1959: Lee Petty, patriarch of the racing family, won the inaugural 500 Mile NASCAR International Sweepstakes at Daytona on February 22, 1959, defeating Johnny Beauchamp.
* 1960: Junior Johnson made use of the draft, then a little-understood phenomenon, to win while running a slower, year-old car in a field of 68 cars, the most in the history of the Daytona 500.
* 1961: First race to be called Daytona 500.
* 1965: The first rain-shortened Daytona 500. Fred Lorenzen was in the lead when the race was called on lap 133 of 200.
* 1966: Richard Petty becomes the first two-time winner, having previously won the 1964 race. Through 2024, only 12 drivers have won 2 or more Daytona 500s.
* 1967: Mario Andretti led 112 of the 200 laps including the last 33 to capture his first and only win in the Cup Series.
* 1968: For much of this race, both Cale Yarborough and (unrelated) LeeRoy Yarbrough traded the lead. With 5 laps to go, Cale made a successful slingshot pass on the third turn to take the lead from LeeRoy and never looked back as he won his first Daytona 500 by 1.3 seconds.
* 1969: Having learned from the previous year, LeeRoy Yarbrough would use the same slingshot treatment out of turn 3 on Charlie Glotzbach, to score the victory on the final lap.
* 1971: Richard Petty becomes the first three-time winner, including the 1964 and 1966 races. Through 2015, only 5 drivers have won 3 or more Daytona 500s.
* 1972: A. J. Foyt cruised into the lead on lap 80 and stayed there through the 200 lap race, lapping the entire field. Foyt beat second-place Charlie Glotzbach by nearly two laps, with Jim Vandiver finishing 6 laps down in third.
* 1973: Richard Petty becomes the first four-time winner, including the 1964, 1966, and 1971 races. Through 2015, only Petty (7 total) and Cale Yarborough have won at least 4 Daytona 500s.
* 1974: During the start of the 1974 NASCAR season, many races had their distance cut ten percent in response to the 1973 oil crisis. As a result, the 1974 Daytona 500 was shortened to 180 laps (450 miles), as symbolically, the race &quot;started&quot; on lap 21. Richard Petty became the first of only 4 drivers (as of 2021) to win consecutive Daytona 500s, while also setting a mark of 5 total wins.
* 1976: In the 1976 race, Richard Petty was leading on the last lap when he was passed on the backstretch by David Pearson. Petty tried to turn under Pearson coming off the final corner but didn&#x27;t clear Pearson. The contact caused the drivers to spin into the grass in the infield just short of the finish line. Petty&#x27;s car didn&#x27;t start, but Pearson was able to keep his car running and limp over the finish line for the win. Many fans consider this finish to be the greatest in the history of NASCAR.
* 1979: The 1979 race was the first Daytona 500 to be broadcast live on national television, airing on CBS, whose audience was increased in much of the Eastern and Midwestern USA due to a blizzard. (The Indianapolis 500 was only broadcast on tape delay that evening in this era; most races were broadcast only through the final quarter to half of the race, as was the procedure for ABC&#x27;s Championship Auto Racing broadcasts; with the new CBS contract, the network and NASCAR agreed to a full live broadcast.) That telecast introduced in-car and low-level track-side cameras, which has now become standard in all sorts of automotive racing broadcasts. A final lap crash and subsequent fight between leaders Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison (along with Donnie&#x27;s brother Bobby) brought national (if unwelcome) publicity to NASCAR, with the added emphasis of a snowstorm that bogged down much of the northeastern part of the United States. Donnie Allison was leading the race on the final lap with Yarborough drafting him tightly. As Yarborough attempted a slingshot pass at the end of the backstretch, Allison attempted to block him. Yarborough refused to give ground and as he pulled alongside Allison, his left side tires left the pavement and went into the wet and muddy infield grass. Yarborough lost control of his car and contacted Allison&#x27;s car halfway down the backstretch. As both drivers tried to regain control, their cars made contact several more times before finally locking together and crashing into the outside wall in turn three. After the cars settled in the grass, Donnie Allison and Yarborough began to argue. After they had talked it out, Bobby Allison, who was lapped at that point, pulled over, began defending his brother, and a fight broke out. Richard Petty, who was over half a lap behind at the time, went on to win; with the brawl in the infield, the television audience scarcely noticed. The story was the talk of the water cooler the next day, even making the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; Sports section.
* 1980: Buddy Baker won the fastest Daytona 500 in history before the introduction of mandatory stage cautions in 2017, at 177.602 mph (285.809 km/h).
* 1981: Richard Petty becomes the first seven-time winner, three wins more than the second-highest multiple winner, Cale Yarborough. With wins in 1964, 1966, 1971, 1973, 1974, and 1979, Petty is the only driver to win in three different decades.
* 1982: The Daytona 500 becomes the opening race in the NASCAR season, a position held since. Bobby Allison wins his second Daytona 500 but many people consider this a controversial win because on lap 3 Bobby Allison&#x27;s rear bumper broke away from the car (later it was discovered that it was welded on purpose by a wire welder) and caused a pileup further behind the leaders. Without a rear bumper, Allison&#x27;s car gained an aerodynamic advantage and won the race by just over twenty-two seconds.
* 1983: Cale Yarborough was the first driver to run a qualifying lap over in his Chevrolet Monte Carlo; only to crash out during the second qualifying lap. Yarborough raced in a backup Pontiac LeMans displayed at a nearby Hardee&#x27;s (Yarborough&#x27;s sponsor) and took the backup car to his 3rd Daytona 500 victory. This would also be the final time a driver won a Daytona 500 in a Pontiac.
* 1984: Cale Yarborough completed a lap of , officially breaking the barrier at Daytona. He joined Richard Petty as the only drivers to win the race in consecutive years and to win the race four times overall.
* 1985: Bill Elliott dominated the race, and by lap 140, was close to lapping the entire field. During a pit stop, NASCAR officials held him in the pit area in order to repair a supposed broken headlight assembly. The two-minute pit stop dropped him to third, barely clinging to the lead lap. Elliott made up the deficit and survived a late-race caution and a final lap restart to win his first Daytona 500. Elliott would go on to win the first Winston Million.
* 1986: The race that came down to a two-car duel between Dale Earnhardt and Geoff Bodine. With 3 laps to go, Earnhardt was forced to make a pit stop for a &quot;splash &#x27;n go&quot;. However, as Earnhardt left the pits, he burned a piston, allowing Bodine to cruise to victory.
* 1987: Winner Bill Elliott qualified for the pole position at an all-time Daytona record of 210.364 mph (338.532 km/h). Bill Elliott dominated much of the race, leading 104 of the 200 laps. During two different points in the race, he pulled away from the other leaders and was all by himself on the track, leading the first 35 laps, 29 in a row at another point, and the last three.
* 1988: Restrictor plates were mandated to reduce dangerously high speeds at Daytona. This race was remembered for two things. First, Richard Petty&#x27;s rollover crash in the tri-oval on lap 106, initiated when he was tagged from behind by Phil Barkdoll. Petty rolled over about eight times and was then hit by Brett Bodine. The wreck also collected 1972 race winner A. J. Foyt, Eddie Bierschwale, and Alan Kulwicki. All of the drivers, including Petty, walked away. Second, Bobby Allison and his son Davey finished one-two and celebrated together in Victory Lane, making Bobby Allison the oldest driver to win the Daytona 500.
* 1989: Darrell Waltrip stretches his final tank of fuel for 53 laps to win in his 17th try.
* 1990: Dale Earnhardt appeared headed for certain victory until the closing laps. On lap 193, Geoff Bodine spun in the first turn, causing the third and final caution of the race. All of the leaders pitted except Derrike Cope, who stayed out to gain track position. On the lap 195 restart, Earnhardt re-took the lead. On the final lap, going into turn three, he ran over a bell housing from the blown engine of Rick Wilson&#x27;s car. He blew a tire, allowing the relatively unknown Cope to slip by and take his first career win in a major upset.
* 1991: Dale Earnhardt&#x27;s Daytona 500 frustrations continued as Ernie Irvan passed Earnhardt with six laps to go to. Ultimately, Earnhardt - who was battling issues with the car temperature after striking a seagull early in the race - spun with two laps remaining and collected Davey Allison and Kyle Petty. Irvan took the win as the race ended under the caution flag. The race was dominated by complex pit stop rules, implemented to improve safety in the pit area.
* 1992: Davey Allison dominated the second half en route to his lone Daytona 500 victory. He avoided a major wreck on lap 92 and went on to lead the final 102 laps.
* 1993: In a frightening wreck on lap 170, Rusty Wallace flipped over multiple times on the back straightaway. With two laps to go, Dale Earnhardt was leading Jeff Gordon and Dale Jarrett. Jarrett battled into the lead with one lap to go. It was the fourth time Earnhardt had been leading the Daytona 500 with less than ten laps to go but failed to win.
* 1994: Sterling Marlin gambled on fuel and was able to complete the final 59 laps without stopping, to win his first career Cup victory. During Speedweeks, two drivers, Neil Bonnett and Rodney Orr, died during separate practice accidents. Also, Loy Allen became the first rookie to start the Daytona 500 on the pole.
* 1995: Sterling Marlin became the first driver since Cale Yarborough, and only third overall, to win back-to-back Daytona 500s. It was the third win in five years for Morgan–McClure Motorsports (1991, 1994, 1995).
* 1996: Dale Jarrett won his second Daytona 500 in four years, again holding off Dale Earnhardt, who finished second for the third time in four years.
* 1997: Jeff Gordon became the youngest winner of the event to that point at the age of 25 in a three-way finish under caution with Hendrick Motorsports teammates Terry Labonte and Ricky Craven finishing second and third. Dale Earnhardt&#x27;s Daytona &#x27;curse&#x27; continued as, while contending for the lead with 12 laps to go, he was involved in a rollover crash on the backstretch, though after observing from an ambulance that his car was still relatively intact, got back in and finished the race in 31st.
* 1998: Dale Earnhardt finally won the Daytona 500 after &quot;20 years of trying, 20 years of frustration.&quot; Though Earnhardt had usually been a strong competitor in the Daytona 500, mechanical problems, crashes, or other misfortunes had prevented him from winning.
* 1999: Jeff Gordon accomplished the feat of winning the pole and the race marking the first time since 1987 when Bill Elliott did this.
* 2000: Dale Jarrett avenged his previous year&#x27;s rollover accident by winning the 1999 season championship &amp; 2000 500 which was the final 500 broadcast for CBS.
* 2001: Also known as &quot;Black Sunday,&quot; or the &quot;darkest day in NASCAR,” as Dale Earnhardt died in a crash on the final lap. Michael Waltrip and Dale Earnhardt Jr. were running first and second on the final lap, while Earnhardt Sr. was third. In turn 4, Earnhardt lost control after making contact from Sterling Marlin, and crashed into the outside wall, taking Ken Schrader with him. Earnhardt suffered a fatal basilar skull fracture. The death overshadowed Waltrip&#x27;s first win, which came in his 463rd Cup Series race.
* 2003: Michael Waltrip became a two-time winner in the shortest ever Daytona 500 after the race was shortened to 109 laps due to rain.
* 2004: Dale Earnhardt Jr. won his first Daytona 500 in his fifth attempt, six years after his father accomplished the feat after 20 attempts.
* 2005: The start time was changed, allowing the race to finish under the lights at dusk. In the first use of the green-white-checkered finish rule in the Daytona 500, Gordon held off Kurt Busch, and Earnhardt Jr. to win his third Daytona 500. The race went 203 laps/507.5 miles.
* 2007: Running fifth with half a lap to go, Kevin Harvick picked up a push and surged to the front to nip Mark Martin by 0.02 seconds at the line. Most of the rest of the field crashed across the line as The Big One erupted behind them.
* 2008: The celebrated 50th running of the Daytona 500 was the first using NASCAR&#x27;s Car of Tomorrow. It also marked the first race under the &quot;Sprint Cup Series&quot; banner, following the merger of Sprint with Nextel in 2006.

* 2010: The longest Daytona 500 distance until the 2020 event, 208 laps (), due to requiring two green-white-checker efforts to finish the race. Jamie McMurray came home with the 2010 Daytona 500 victory. Dale Earnhardt Jr. finished second.
* 2011: Since this race marked the tenth anniversary of the death of Dale Earnhardt, the third lap was a &quot;silent lap&quot;, meaning the TV and radio announcers were silent during the entire lap, and fans held up three fingers in reference to Earnhardt&#x27;s car number. Trevor Bayne, at 20 years and one day old, became the youngest Daytona 500 winner ever.
* 2012: While 2010 was the longest distance, 2012 was the longest time to complete the race. Scheduled for a 12 noon EST start on Sunday, rain delayed the race to Monday, then further delayed it to a 7 PM start that Monday night, resulting in the first primetime Daytona 500 start (but the third to reach primetime). On lap 160, Juan Pablo Montoya crashed into a jet dryer in turn 3, sparking a lengthy red flag as crews put out the resulting fire and repaired the damage. The race finally ended at approximately 1 AM EST Tuesday morning, 37 hours after the originally scheduled start, with Matt Kenseth becoming the first repeat winner since Jeff Gordon who won the 2005 race. It was attended by that year&#x27;s presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who met his once removed sixteenth cousin and professional wrestler John Cena Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and musician Lenny Kravitz there.
* 2013: There were a number of firsts. This was the first race with NASCAR&#x27;s new redesigned Generation 6 body. Rookie Danica Patrick won the pole, becoming the first woman on pole in the Daytona 500 and also the first woman to finish among the Top 10. Jimmie Johnson earned his second Daytona 500 victory.
* 2014: For the second year in a row, a rookie won the pole position, in this case, Austin Dillon in his first ride in the newly renumbered #3 Chevy SS for Richard Childress Racing, the first time the #3 had been used in a NASCAR Cup Series race since Dale Earnhardt&#x27;s death. Dale Earnhardt Jr., won his second Daytona 500, the third straight won by a past winner, after Kenseth in 2012 and Johnson in 2013. The race was delayed 6 hours, 22 minutes, and ended at 11:18 p.m. ET Sunday night.

* 2015: Jeff Gordon won the pole for the final time. There were two big wrecks during the race, one with 19 laps to go for Justin Allgaier and Ty Dillon, brought out a red flag to ensue cleanup on the track, and one on lap 202 at a scheduled Green–white–checkered finish, Joey Logano won his first Daytona 500.
* 2016: Rookie Chase Elliott started the race from the pole position. Driver Denny Hamlin led 95 laps during the race, and on the last lap, Hamlin passed leader Matt Kenseth. Hamlin would then beat Martin Truex Jr. by 0.010 seconds, which would become the closest finish in the Daytona 500.
* 2017: The very first race in the era of stage caution breaks. Chase Elliott started the race from the pole for the second year in a row. Several big wrecks decimated the field but a long green run to the finish put everyone in fuel trouble. Kurt Busch won as Elliott, Martin Truex Jr., and Kyle Larson all ran out of fuel in the last four laps.
* 2018: 20 years after Dale Earnhardt Sr. earned his iconic victory at Daytona, Austin Dillon brought Richard Childress&#x27;s #3 Chevrolet back to Victory Lane. Dillon, Childress&#x27;s grandson, who was photographed next to Earnhardt as a child after the earlier win, led only the final lap, bumping leader Aric Almirola out of the way, sending the latter&#x27;s Ford into the wall. Also of note, rookie Darrell Wallace Jr. finished in the runner-up spot, barely edging out 2016 winner Denny Hamlin, the highest finish for an African-American driver in the event&#x27;s history. It was also the final NASCAR race for Danica Patrick, who was collected in a multi-car wreck near the end of the second stage that also ended the days of Chase Elliott, Brad Keselowski, Kevin Harvick, among others. This race was also the fastest Daytona 500 in the stages era.
* 2019: The last race to use traditional restrictor plates in NASCAR since 1988. William Byron started on the pole alongside Alex Bowman, making it the youngest front-row starters in Daytona 500 history. Kurt Busch was caught up in an early wreck after contact with Ricky Stenhouse Jr., collecting Jamie McMurray, Austin Dillon, and Bubba Wallace. Kyle Busch would win stage 1 and Ryan Blaney would win stage 2. Matt DiBenedetto, driving for Leavine Family Racing, would lead a race-high of 49 laps until he was caught up in &quot;The Big One&quot; with nine laps to go after contact with Paul Menard going into turn 3, collecting 18 cars in all. Two more wrecks occurring in the final 5 laps forced the race into overtime. Denny Hamlin escaped through all the late crashes and would go on to win his second Daytona 500 race in his career. Joe Gibbs earned his third Daytona 500 victory. Gibbs-owned Toyotas swept the top three spots, as Kyle Busch finished second and Erik Jones third. It was the second time in event history that one team took home the first three spots, and the first time since Hendrick Motorsports achieved the feat in 1997.
* 2020: Donald Trump is the second President of the United States to serve as Daytona 500 Grand Marshal (after George W. Bush in 2004), and the opening lap is paced by the official Presidential state car. Shortly after this, continuing rain showers caused the race to be postponed for one day, for the first time in eight years. Denny Hamlin won his third Daytona 500 the next day in the second-closest finish in race history, though the win was overshadowed by a horrific accident for Ryan Newman on the final lap, being sent to a nearby hospital.
* 2021: Much like 2011, this race also had a &quot;silent lap&quot; on lap 3. Ironically, Derrike Cope, the 1990 Daytona 500 winner making his final start, blew a tire on this lap headed into turn 3, much like how Dale Earnhardt blew a tire on the final lap of the aforementioned 500. On lap 14, a 16-car wreck occurred before the race was red-flagged due to rain. After a 5-hour 40 minute stoppage, at 9:07pm the race resumed with Denny Hamlin eventually winning both stages. On the last lap, which occurred after midnight, a big wreck occurred in turn 3 and Michael McDowell scored his first career Cup win.

* 2022: The first race with the Generation 7 &quot;Next-Gen&quot; car. On Lap 63, an eight-car wreck caused by Brad Keselowski, who now was a part owner at RFK Racing, would lead to rookie Harrison Burton flipping his car. Keselowski later turned Stenhouse Jr. with six laps to go in the race. Austin Cindric would hold off Bubba Wallace at the finish line to win the 500 in only his 8th Cup start, while also becoming the second youngest driver to win (behind Trevor Bayne).
* 2023: The 2023 Daytona 500 saw Ricky Stenhouse Jr. claim victory after a dramatic double-overtime finish. This win marked Stenhouse&#x27;s first Daytona 500 victory and his third career Cup Series win. The race featured numerous lead changes and several multi-car wrecks, including a massive crash on Lap 118 and another big wreck in the final laps. These incidents led to the race going into double overtime. Joey Logano finished second, followed by Christopher Bell in third. Kyle Busch and Brad Keselowski also had strong runs but were involved in late-race incidents that impacted the final standings. Despite the chaos, Stenhouse managed to navigate through the wreckage and hold off Joey Logano to secure the win in a thrilling conclusion.

* 2025: President Trump made his second attendance to the Daytona 500.

==Qualifying procedure==

The qualifying procedure is unique for the Daytona 500. Some teams must race their way into the Daytona 500 field. The first row is set by a timed round of qualifying. Prior to 2021, the session was held one week before the race (prior to 2003, this was two rounds; prior to 2001, it was three) but the session is now held on the Wednesday evening leading up to the race. The remainder of the field is set on the Thursday before the race by two separate qualifying races (these were from 1959 to 1967; from 1969 to 2004; and with a two-lap overtime, if necessary, beginning in 2005 (these races were not held in 1968 due to rain)). The top two drivers from the qualifying races who were not in the top 35 in owner points were given spots on the field, and the rest of the field was set by the finishing order of the duels, with guaranteed spots to those in the top 35. The remaining spots, 40 to 43, were filled by top qualifying times of those not already in the field from the qualifying race. If there was a previous NASCAR champion without a spot, he would get one of those four spots, otherwise, the fourth-fastest car was added to the field.

Prior to 2005 – and beginning again in 2013 – after the top two cars were set, the top fourteen cars in the qualifying races advance to the field, and then between six (1998–2003), eight (1995–97, 2004) or 10 (until 1994) fastest cars which do not advance from the qualifying race are added, then cars in the top 35 in owner points not locked into the race, and then the driver with the championship provisional, except for 1985 when no such car was eligible for a provisional starting spot, the only time that happened in the Daytona 500 from when the provisional was added in 1976 through 2004.

==Television==
The Daytona 500 was the first auto race to be televised live flag-to-flag on network television when CBS aired it in 1979, continuing to air until 2000.

From 2001 to 2006, the race alternated between Fox and NBC under the terms of a six–year, $2.48 billion NASCAR television contract, with Fox broadcasting the Daytona 500 in odd-numbered years (2001, 2003, 2005) and the Pepsi 400 in even-numbered years (2002, 2004, 2006) and NBC broadcasting the opposite race in that year.

In 2005, a new television contract was signed, which made Fox the sole broadcaster of the Daytona 500 for eight years, from 2007 to 2014. In 2013, 10 more years were added to the contract, giving Fox every Daytona 500 from 2015 to 2024 as well, for a total of at least 20 Daytona 500s in a row. The installation of the lighting system at Daytona International Speedway in 1998, as well as the implementations of the television packages in 2001 and 2007 respectively, have resulted in the race starting and ending much later than it did in the race&#x27;s early years. The race started at 12:15 p.m. EST from 1979 until 2000. The start time was moved to 1:00 p.m EST from 2001 to 2004, 2:30 p.m. in 2005 and 2006, and 3:30 p.m. from 2007 to 2009, all for the convenience of west coast viewers. The 2005 race ended at sunset for the first time in its history, and the 2006 race ended well after sunset.

Every Daytona 500 between 2006 and 2010, as well as the 2012 and 2014 races, ended under the lights. The changing track conditions caused by the onset of darkness in the closing laps in these years forced the crew chiefs to predict the critical car setup adjustments needed for their final two pit stops. The 2007 race was the first Daytona 500 to go into prime-time, ending at 7:07 p.m. Eastern time. In 2010, the race moved back to a 1:00 p.m. start time, which should have resulted in it ending in daylight; however, two red flags caused by track surface issues led to long delays that pushed the race to 7:34 p.m. EST, pushing the race into prime-time for the second time. The 2012 race was also scheduled to start at 1:00 p.m. EST on Sunday, February 26, but heavy rain in the area caused the race to be postponed to 7:00 p.m. EST on Monday, February 27, making it the first Daytona 500 to be postponed to a Monday, as well as the first (and only) Daytona 500 to be run as a night race. Due to a two–hour red flag period after a jet dryer fire on the track with 40 laps remaining, the race did not end until about 12:40 a.m. on Tuesday, February 28. The 2013 race marked a return to the race&#x27;s past tradition of ending in the late afternoon, as it ended at about 4:40 p.m., the race&#x27;s earliest ending time since 2004. Although the 2014 race started around 1:30 p.m. EST, heavy rain and a tornado warning red–flagged the race after 38 laps and it was delayed for a record six hours and 22 minutes; the race finished the entire 500–mile distance around after 11:00 p.m. the same day, which effectively competed with the time-delayed East Coast broadcast of NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2014 Winter Olympics closing ceremony, scheduled between 7:00 and 10:30 p.m. The 2015 race started on time around 1:00  p.m., and ended after 203 laps due to a Green–white–checkered finish.

The television ratings for the Daytona 500 have surpassed those of the larger Indianapolis 500 (which has much larger physical attendance and international attendance) since 1995, even though the 1995 race was available in far fewer homes than the year before. Then-broadcaster CBS had lost well-established VHF (channels 2–13) affiliates in major markets as a result of the Fox affiliate switches of 1994. As an example, new affiliates WDJT in Milwaukee and WGNX in Atlanta — both cities that are home to NASCAR races — and WWJ in Detroit, close to Michigan International Speedway, were on the UHF band (channels 14–69), meaning that they had a significantly reduced broadcast area compared to former affiliates WITI, WAGA-TV, and WJBK, respectively. WDJT was not available in many Wisconsin markets by the time the Daytona 500 took place.

Rain delays forced the 2025 Daytona 500 race to go on longer, with television coverage cutting into numerous Fox Animation Domination shows.

<text>Michael Gerard Tyson (born June 30, 1966) is an American former professional boxer who competed between 1985 to 2024. Nicknamed &quot;Iron Mike&quot; and &quot;Kid Dynamite&quot; in his early career, and later known as &quot;the Baddest Man on the Planet&quot;, Tyson is regarded as one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time. He reigned as the undisputed world heavyweight champion from 1987 to 1990. Tyson won his first 19 professional fights by knockout, 12 of them in the first round. Claiming his first belt at 20 years, 4 months, and 22 days old, Tyson holds the record as the youngest boxer ever to win a heavyweight title. He was the first heavyweight boxer to simultaneously hold the World Boxing Association (WBA), World Boxing Council (WBC), and International Boxing Federation (IBF) titles, as well as the only heavyweight to unify them in succession. The following year, Tyson became the lineal champion when he knocked out Michael Spinks in 91 seconds of the first round. In 1990, Tyson lost the undisputed heavyweight championship when he was knocked out by underdog Buster Douglas, making it one of the biggest upsets in boxing history.

In 1992, he was convicted of rape and sentenced to six years in prison. He was released on parole after three years. After his release in 1995, he engaged in a series of comeback fights, regaining the WBA and WBC titles in 1996 to join Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali, Tim Witherspoon, Evander Holyfield and George Foreman as the only men in boxing history to have regained a heavyweight championship after losing it. After being stripped of the WBC title in the same year, Tyson lost the WBA title to Evander Holyfield by an eleventh round stoppage. Their 1997 rematch ended when Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfield&#x27;s ears. In 2002, Tyson fought for the world heavyweight title, losing by knockout to Lennox Lewis. In November 2024, his bout against Jake Paul, which he lost via unanimous decision, became the biggest boxing gate in US history outside of Las Vegas.

Tyson was known for his ferocious and intimidating boxing style as well as his controversial behavior inside and outside the ring, which he explained was inspired by Sonny Liston, a boxer who is widely regarded as the most intimidating man in the history of boxing. With a knockout-to-win percentage of 88%, he was ranked 16th on &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of 100 greatest punchers of all time, and first on ESPN&#x27;s list of &quot;The Hardest Hitters in Heavyweight History&quot;. Sky Sports described him as &quot;perhaps the most ferocious fighter to step into a professional ring&quot;. He has been inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame.

Outside his boxing career, Tyson has appeared in various popular media. He appeared in the well-received movies &quot;Rocky Balboa &quot; (2006) and &quot;The Hangover&quot; (2009).

==Early life==
Michael Gerard Tyson was born in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, New York City, on June 30, 1966. He has an older brother named Rodney (born ) and had an older sister named Denise, who died of a heart attack at age 24 in February 1990. Tyson&#x27;s mother, born in Charlottesville, Virginia, was described as a promiscuous woman who might have been a prostitute. Tyson&#x27;s biological father is listed as &quot;Purcell Tyson&quot;, a &quot;humble cab driver&quot; (who was from Jamaica) on his birth certificate, but the man Tyson had known as his father was a pimp named Jimmy Kirkpatrick. Kirkpatrick was from Grier Town, North Carolina (a predominantly black neighborhood that was annexed by the city of Charlotte), where he was one of the neighborhood&#x27;s top baseball players. Kirkpatrick married and had a son, Tyson&#x27;s half-brother Jimmie Lee Kirkpatrick, who would help to integrate Charlotte high school football in 1965. In 1959, Jimmy Kirkpatrick left his family and moved to Brooklyn, where he met Tyson&#x27;s mother, Lorna Mae (Smith) Tyson. Kirkpatrick frequented pool halls, gambled and hung out on the streets. &quot;My father was just a regular street guy caught up in the street world,&quot; Tyson said. Kirkpatrick abandoned the Tyson family around the time Mike was born, leaving Tyson&#x27;s mother to care for the children on her own. Kirkpatrick died in 1992.

The family lived in Bedford-Stuyvesant until their financial burdens necessitated a move to Brownsville when Tyson was 10 years old. Throughout his childhood, Tyson lived in and around neighborhoods with a high rate of crime. According to an interview in &quot;Details&quot;, his first fight was with a bigger youth who had pulled the head off one of Tyson&#x27;s pigeons. Tyson was repeatedly caught committing petty crimes and fighting those who ridiculed his high-pitched voice and lisp. By the age of 13, he had been arrested 38 times. He ended up at the Tryon School for Boys in Johnstown, New York. Tyson&#x27;s emerging boxing ability was discovered there by Bobby Stewart, a juvenile detention center counselor and former boxer. Stewart considered Tyson to be an outstanding fighter and trained him for a few months before introducing him to boxing manager and trainer Cus D&#x27;Amato. Tyson dropped out of high school as a junior. He was later awarded an honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters from Central State University in 1989. Kevin Rooney also trained Tyson, and he was occasionally assisted by Teddy Atlas, although Atlas was dismissed by D&#x27;Amato when Tyson was 15. Rooney eventually took over all training duties for the young fighter.

Tyson&#x27;s mother died when he was 16, leaving him in the care of D&#x27;Amato, who would become his legal guardian. Tyson later said, &quot;I never saw my mother happy with me and proud of me for doing something: she only knew me as being a wild kid running the streets, coming home with new clothes that she knew I didn&#x27;t pay for. I never got a chance to talk to her or know about her. Professionally, it has no effect, but it&#x27;s crushing emotionally and personally.&quot;

==Amateur career==
As an amateur, Tyson won gold medals at the 1981 and 1982 Junior Olympic Games, defeating Joe Cortez in 1981 and beating Kelton Brown in 1982. Brown&#x27;s corner threw in the towel in the first round. In 1984 Tyson won the gold medal at the Nation Golden Gloves held in New York, beating Jonathan Littles. He fought Henry Tillman twice as an amateur, losing both bouts by decision. Tillman went on to win heavyweight gold at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

==Professional career==

===Early career===
Tyson made his professional debut as an 18-year-old on March 6, 1985, in Albany, New York. He defeated Hector Mercedes via first-round TKO. He had 15 bouts in his first year as a professional. Fighting frequently, Tyson won 26 of his first 28 fights by KO or TKO; 16 of those came in the first round. The quality of his opponents gradually increased to journeyman fighters and borderline contenders, like James Tillis, David Jaco, Jesse Ferguson, Mitch Green, and Marvis Frazier. His win streak attracted media attention and Tyson was billed as the next great heavyweight champion. D&#x27;Amato died in November 1985, relatively early into Tyson&#x27;s professional career, and some speculate that his death was the catalyst to many of the troubles Tyson was to experience as his life and career progressed.

===Rise up the ranks===
Tyson&#x27;s first nationally televised bout took place on February 16, 1986, at Houston Field House in Troy, New York, against journeyman heavyweight Jesse Ferguson, and was carried by ABC Sports. Tyson knocked down Ferguson with an uppercut in the fifth round that broke Ferguson&#x27;s nose. During the sixth round, Ferguson began to hold and clinch Tyson in an apparent attempt to avoid further punishment. After admonishing Ferguson several times to obey his commands to box, the referee finally stopped the fight near the middle of the sixth round. The fight was initially ruled a win for Tyson by disqualification (DQ) of his opponent. The ruling was &quot;adjusted&quot; to a win by technical knockout (TKO) after Tyson&#x27;s corner protested that a DQ win would end Tyson&#x27;s string of knockout victories, and that a knockout would have been the inevitable result.

In July, after recording six more knockout victories, Tyson fought former world title challenger Marvis Frazier in Glens Falls, New York, on another ABC Sports broadcast. Tyson won easily, charging at Frazier at the opening bell and hitting him with two consecutive uppercuts, the second of which knocked Frazier unconscious thirty seconds into the fight.

After his win over Frazier, Tyson was booked to fight José Ribalta at the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey in 1986. Ribalta would hit Tyson in the body throughout the fight. Tyson knocked down Ribalta three times in the 2nd, 8th, and 10th round when the referee called the fight off. Tyson would go on to say that Ribalta was his toughest fight commenting, &quot;I hit Jose Ribalta with everything, and he took everything and kept coming back for more. Jose Ribalta stood toe to toe with me. He was very strong in the clinches,&quot; and &quot;Ribalta was a game fighter who actually engaged me. I felt nauseous from all Ribalta’s body blows, even hours after the fight. I never felt that much general pain again.&quot;

===WBC heavyweight champion===
====Tyson vs. Berbick====

On November 22, 1986, Tyson was given his first title fight against Trevor Berbick for the World Boxing Council (WBC) heavyweight championship. Tyson won the title by TKO in the second round, and at the age of 20 years and 4 months became the youngest heavyweight champion in history. He added the WBA and IBF titles after defeating James Smith and Tony Tucker in 1987. Tyson&#x27;s dominant performances brought many accolades. Donald Saunders wrote: &quot;The noble and manly art of boxing can at least cease worrying about its immediate future, now [that] it has discovered a heavyweight champion fit to stand alongside Dempsey, Tunney, Louis, Marciano, and Ali.&quot;

Tyson intimidated fighters with his strength, combined with outstanding hand speed, accuracy, coordination and timing. Tyson also possessed notable defensive abilities, holding his hands high in the peek-a-boo style taught by his mentor Cus D&#x27;Amato to slip under and weave around his opponent&#x27;s punches while timing his own. Tyson&#x27;s explosive punching technique was due in large part to crouching immediately prior to throwing a hook or an uppercut: this allowed the &quot;spring&quot; of his legs to add power to the punch. Among his signature moves was a right hook to his opponent&#x27;s body followed by a right uppercut to his opponent&#x27;s chin. Lorenzo Boyd, Jesse Ferguson and José Ribalta were each knocked down by this combination.

===Unified heavyweight champion===
====Tyson vs. Smith, Thomas====

Expectations for Tyson were extremely high, and he was the favorite to win the heavyweight unification series, a tournament designed to establish an undisputed heavyweight champion. Tyson defended his title against James Smith on March 7, 1987, in Las Vegas, Nevada. He won by unanimous decision and added Smith&#x27;s World Boxing Association (WBA) title to his existing belt. &quot;Tyson-mania&quot; in the media was becoming rampant.

He beat Pinklon Thomas in May by TKO in the sixth round.

===Undisputed heavyweight champion===
====Tyson vs. Tucker====

On August 1 he took the International Boxing Federation (IBF) title from Tony Tucker in a twelve-round unanimous decision 119–111, 118–113, and 116–112. He became the first heavyweight to own all three major belts – WBA, WBC, and IBF – at the same time.

====Tyson vs. Biggs, Holmes, Tubbs====
Another fight, in October of that year, ended with a victory for Tyson over 1984 Olympic super heavyweight gold medalist Tyrell Biggs by TKO in the seventh round.
During this time, Tyson came to the attention of gaming company Nintendo. After witnessing one of Tyson&#x27;s fights, Nintendo of America president Minoru Arakawa was impressed by the fighter&#x27;s &quot;power and skill&quot;, prompting him to suggest Tyson be included in the upcoming Nintendo Entertainment System port of the &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; arcade game. In 1987, Nintendo released &quot;Mike Tyson&#x27;s Punch-Out!!&quot;, which was well received and sold more than a million copies. It has retrospectively been considered one of the greatest games of all-time.

Tyson had three fights in 1988. He faced Larry Holmes on January 22, 1988, and defeated the legendary former champion by KO in the fourth round. This was the only knockout loss Holmes had in 75 professional bouts.

In March, Tyson then fought contender Tony Tubbs in Tokyo, Japan, fitting in an easy second-round TKO victory amid promotional and marketing work.

====Tyson vs. Spinks====

On June 27, 1988, Tyson faced Michael Spinks. Spinks, who had taken the heavyweight championship from Larry Holmes via fifteen-round decision in 1985, had not lost his title in the ring but was not recognized as champion by the major boxing organizations. Holmes had previously given up all but the IBF title, and that was eventually stripped from Spinks after he elected to fight Gerry Cooney (winning by TKO in the fifth round) rather than IBF Number 1 Contender Tony Tucker, as the Cooney fight provided him a larger purse. However, Spinks did become the lineal champion by beating Holmes and many (including &quot;Ring&quot; magazine) considered him to have a legitimate claim to being the true heavyweight champion. The bout was, at the time, the richest fight in history and expectations were very high. Boxing pundits were predicting a titanic battle of styles, with Tyson&#x27;s aggressive infighting conflicting with Spinks&#x27;s skillful out-boxing and footwork. The fight ended after 91 seconds when Tyson knocked Spinks out in the first round; many consider this to be the pinnacle of Tyson&#x27;s fame and boxing ability.

During this period, Tyson&#x27;s problems outside the ring were also beginning to emerge. His marriage to Robin Givens was heading for divorce, and his future contract was being fought over by Don King and Bill Cayton. In late 1988, Tyson parted with manager Bill Cayton and fired longtime trainer Kevin Rooney, the man many credit for honing Tyson&#x27;s craft after the death of D&#x27;Amato. Following Rooney&#x27;s departure, critics alleged that Tyson began to show less head movement and combination punching.

====Tyson vs. Bruno, Carl Williams====
In 1989, Tyson had only two fights amid personal turmoil. He faced the British boxer Frank Bruno in February. Bruno managed to stun Tyson at the end of the first round, although Tyson went on to knock Bruno out in the fifth round. Tyson then knocked out Carl &quot;The Truth&quot; Williams in the first round in July.

====Tyson vs. Douglas====

By 1990, Tyson seemed to have lost direction, and his personal life was in disarray amidst reports of less vigorous training prior to the Buster Douglas match. In a fight on February 11, 1990, he lost the undisputed championship to Douglas in Tokyo. Tyson was a huge betting favorite; indeed, the Mirage, the only casino to put out odds for the fight, made Tyson a 42/1 favorite. Tyson failed to find a way past Douglas&#x27;s quick jab that had a reach advantage over his own. Tyson did catch Douglas with an uppercut in the eighth round and knocked him to the floor, but Douglas recovered sufficiently to hand Tyson a heavy beating in the subsequent two rounds. After the fight, the Tyson camp would complain that the count was slow and that Douglas had taken longer than ten seconds to get back on his feet. Just 35 seconds into the tenth round, Douglas unleashed a brutal uppercut, followed by a four-punch combination of hooks that knocked Tyson down for the first time in his career. He was counted out by referee Octavio Meyran.

The knockout victory by Douglas over Tyson, the previously undefeated &quot;baddest man on the planet&quot; and arguably the most feared boxer in professional boxing at that time, has been described as one of the most shocking upsets in modern sports history.

===Return to the ring===

Despite the shocking loss, Tyson has said that losing to Douglas was the greatest moment of his career: &quot;I needed that fight to make me a better person and fighter. I have a broader perspective of myself and boxing.&quot;

After the loss, Tyson recovered with first-round knockouts of Henry Tillman and Alex Stewart in his next two fights. Tyson&#x27;s victory over Tillman, the 1984 Olympic heavyweight gold medalist, enabled Tyson to avenge his amateur losses at Tillman&#x27;s hands. These bouts set up an elimination match for another shot at the undisputed world heavyweight championship, which Evander Holyfield had taken from Douglas in his first defense of the title.

====Tyson vs. Ruddock====

Tyson, who was the number one contender, faced number two contender Donovan &quot;Razor&quot; Ruddock on March 18, 1991, in Las Vegas. Ruddock was seen as the most dangerous heavyweight around and was thought of as one of the hardest punching heavyweights. Tyson and Ruddock went back and forth for most of the fight, until referee Richard Steele controversially stopped the fight during the seventh round in favor of Tyson. This decision infuriated the fans in attendance, sparking a post-fight melee in the audience. The referee had to be escorted from the ring.

====Tyson vs. Ruddock II====

Tyson and Ruddock met again on June 28 that year, with Tyson knocking down Ruddock twice and winning a twelve-round unanimous decision 113–109, 114–108, and 114–108. A fight between Tyson and Holyfield for the undisputed championship was scheduled for November 8, 1991, at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, but Tyson pulled out after sustaining a rib cartilage injury during training.

===Comeback===

Tyson was convicted of the rape charge on February 10, 1992, and was released in 1995. After being paroled from prison, Tyson easily won his comeback bouts against Peter McNeeley and Buster Mathis Jr. Tyson&#x27;s first comeback fight was marketed as &quot;He&#x27;s back!&quot; and grossed more than US$96 million worldwide, including a United States record $63 million for PPV television. The viewing of the fight was purchased by 1.52 million homes, setting both PPV viewership and revenue records. The 89-second fight elicited criticism that Tyson&#x27;s management lined up &quot;tomato cans&quot; to ensure easy victories for his return. &quot;TV Guide&quot; included the Tyson–McNeeley fight in their list of the 50 Greatest TV Sports Moments of All Time in 1998.

===Second reign as unified heavyweight champion===
====Tyson vs. Bruno II, Seldon====
Tyson regained one belt by easily winning the WBC title against Frank Bruno in March 1996. It was the second fight between the two, and Tyson knocked out Bruno in the third round. In 1996, Lennox Lewis turned down a $13.5 million guarantee to fight Tyson. This would&#x27;ve been Lewis&#x27;s highest fight purse to date. Lewis then accepted $4 million from Don King to step aside and allow Tyson to fight Bruce Seldon for an expected $30 million instead with the intention that if Tyson defeated Seldon, he would fight Lewis next. Tyson added the WBA belt by defeating champion Seldon in the first round in September that year. Seldon was severely criticized and mocked in the popular press for seemingly collapsing to innocuous punches from Tyson.

====Tyson vs. Holyfield====

Tyson attempted to defend the WBA title against Evander Holyfield, who was in the fourth fight of his own comeback. Holyfield had retired in 1994 following the loss of his championship to Michael Moorer. It was said that Don King and others saw former champion Holyfield, who was 34 at the time of the fight and a huge underdog, as a washed-up fighter.

On November 9, 1996, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Tyson faced Holyfield in a title bout dubbed &quot;Finally&quot;. In a surprising turn of events, Holyfield, who was given virtually no chance to win by numerous commentators, defeated Tyson by TKO when referee Mitch Halpern stopped the bout in round eleven. Holyfield became the second boxer to win a heavyweight championship belt three times. Holyfield&#x27;s victory was marred by allegations from Tyson&#x27;s camp of Holyfield&#x27;s frequent headbutts during the bout. Although the headbutts were ruled accidental by the referee, they would become a point of contention in the rematch.

===Post-title career===
====Tyson vs. Holyfield II====

Tyson and Holyfield fought again on June 28, 1997. Originally, Halpern was supposed to be the referee, but after Tyson&#x27;s camp protested, Halpern stepped aside in favor of Mills Lane. The highly anticipated rematch was dubbed &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;, and it was held at the Las Vegas MGM Grand Garden Arena, site of the first bout. It was a lucrative event, drawing even more attention than the first bout and grossing $100 million. Tyson received $30 million and Holyfield $35 million, the highest paid professional boxing purses until 2007. The fight was purchased by 1.99 million households, setting a pay-per-view buy rate record that stood until May 5, 2007, being surpassed by Oscar De La Hoya vs. Floyd Mayweather Jr.

Soon to become one of the most controversial events in modern sports, the fight was stopped at the end of the third round, with Tyson disqualified for biting Holyfield on both ears. The first time Tyson bit him, the match was temporarily stopped. Referee Mills Lane deducted two points from Tyson and the fight resumed. However, after the match resumed, Tyson bit him again, resulting in his disqualification, and Holyfield won the match. The first bite was severe enough to remove a piece of Holyfield&#x27;s right ear, which was found on the ring floor after the fight. Tyson later stated that his actions were retaliation for Holyfield repeatedly headbutting him without penalty. In the confusion that followed the ending of the bout and announcement of the decision, a near riot occurred in the arena and several people were injured. Tyson Holyfield II was the first heavyweight title fight in over 50 years to end in a disqualification.

As a fallout from the incident, US$3 million was immediately withheld from Tyson&#x27;s $30-million purse by the Nevada state boxing commission (the most it could legally hold back at the time). Two days after the fight, Tyson issued a statement, apologizing to Holyfield for his actions and asked not to be banned for life over the incident. Tyson was roundly condemned in the news media but was not without defenders. Novelist and commentator Katherine Dunn wrote a column that criticized Holyfield&#x27;s sportsmanship in the controversial bout and charged the news media with being biased against Tyson.

On July 9, 1997, Tyson&#x27;s boxing license was rescinded by the Nevada State Athletic Commission in a unanimous voice vote; he was also fined US$3 million and ordered to pay the legal costs of the hearing. As most state athletic commissions honor sanctions imposed by other states, this effectively made Tyson unable to box in the United States. The revocation was not permanent, as the commission voted 4–1 to restore Tyson&#x27;s boxing license on October 18, 1998.

During his time away from boxing in 1998, Tyson made a guest appearance at WrestleMania XIV as an enforcer for the main event match between Shawn Michaels and Steve Austin. During this time, Tyson was also an unofficial member of Michaels&#x27;s stable, D-Generation X. Tyson was paid $3 million for being guest enforcer of the match at WrestleMania XIV.


In January 1999, Tyson returned to the ring for a match against the South African Francois Botha. This match also ended in controversy. While Botha initially controlled the fight, Tyson allegedly attempted to break Botha&#x27;s arms during a tie-up and both boxers were cautioned by the referee in the ill-tempered bout. Botha was ahead on points on all scorecards and was confident enough to mock Tyson as the fight continued. Nonetheless, Tyson landed a straight right hand in the fifth round that knocked out Botha. Critics noticed Tyson stopped using the bob and weave defense altogether following this return. Promoting the fight on Secaucus, New Jersey television station WWOR-TV, Tyson launched into an expletive-laden tirade that forced sports anchor Russ Salzberg to cut the interview short.

Legal problems arose with Tyson once again. On February 5, 1999, Tyson was sentenced to a year&#x27;s imprisonment, fined $5,000, and ordered to serve two years probation along with undergoing 200 hours of community service for assaulting two motorists after a traffic accident on August 31, 1998. He served nine months of that sentence. After his release, he fought Orlin Norris on October 23, 1999. Tyson knocked down Norris with a left hook thrown after the bell sounded to end the first round. Norris injured his knee when he went down and said that he was unable to continue. Consequently, the bout was ruled a no contest.

In 2000, Tyson had three fights. The first match in January was staged at the MEN Arena in Manchester, England against Julius Francis. Following controversy as to whether Tyson was allowed into the country, he took four minutes to knock out Francis, ending the bout in the second round. He also fought Lou Savarese in June 2000 in Glasgow, winning in the first round; the fight lasted only 38 seconds. Tyson continued punching after the referee had stopped the fight, knocking the referee to the floor as he tried to separate the boxers. It was after this fight that Tyson called out Lennox Lewis with his post fight speech proclaiming that he was the &quot;best ever&quot; and he was &quot;Sonny Listion and Jack Dempsey, cut from their cloth.&quot; In October, Tyson fought the similarly controversial Andrew Golota, winning in round three after Gołota was unable to continue due to a broken cheekbone, concussion, and neck injury. The result was later changed to no contest after Tyson refused to take a pre-fight drug test and then tested positive for marijuana in a post-fight urine test. Tyson fought only once in 2001, beating Brian Nielsen in Copenhagen by TKO in the seventh round.

====Tyson vs. Lewis====

Tyson once again had the opportunity to fight for a heavyweight championship in 2002. Lennox Lewis held the WBC, IBF, IBO and Lineal titles at the time. As promising fighters, Tyson and Lewis had sparred at a training camp in a meeting arranged by Cus D&#x27;Amato in 1984. Tyson sought to fight Lewis in Nevada for a more lucrative box-office venue, but the Nevada Boxing Commission refused him a license to box as he was facing possible sexual assault charges at the time.

Two years prior to the bout, Tyson had made several inflammatory remarks to Lewis in an interview following the Savarese fight. The remarks included the statement &quot;I want your heart, I want to eat your children.&quot; On January 22, 2002, the two boxers and their entourages were involved in a brawl at a New York press conference to publicize the planned event. A few weeks later, the Nevada State Athletic Commission refused to grant Tyson a license for the fight, and the promoters had to make alternative arrangements. After multiple states balked at granting Tyson a license, the fight eventually occurred on June 8 at the Pyramid Arena in Memphis, Tennessee. Lewis dominated the fight and knocked out Tyson with a right hand in the eighth round. Tyson was respectful after the fight and praised Lewis on his victory. This fight was the highest-grossing event in pay-per-view history at that time, generating $106.9 million from 1.95 million buys in the US.
In another Memphis fight on February 22, 2003, Tyson beat fringe contender Clifford Etienne 49 seconds into round one. The pre-fight was marred by rumors of Tyson&#x27;s lack of fitness. Some said that he took time out from training to party in Las Vegas and get a new facial tattoo. This eventually proved to be Tyson&#x27;s final professional victory in the ring.

In August 2003, after years of financial struggles, Tyson finally filed for bankruptcy. Tyson earned over $30 million for several of his fights and $300 million during his career. At the time, the media reported that he had approximately $23 million in debt.

On August 13, 2003, Tyson entered the ring for a face-to-face confrontation against K-1 fighter Bob Sapp immediately after Sapp&#x27;s win against Kimo Leopoldo in Las Vegas. K-1 signed Tyson to a contract with the hopes of making a fight happen between the two, but Tyson&#x27;s felony history made it impossible for him to obtain a visa to enter Japan, where the fight would have been most profitable. Alternative locations were discussed, but the fight ultimately did not take place.

On July 30, 2004, Tyson had a match against British boxer Danny Williams in another comeback fight, and this time, staged in Louisville, Kentucky. Tyson dominated the opening two rounds. The third round was even, with Williams getting in some clean blows and also a few illegal ones, for which he was penalized. In the fourth round, Williams took control of the fight landing a succession of accurate and powerful punches that knocked Tyson down. He failed to beat the count and was thus defeated by KO. After the fight, Tyson&#x27;s manager claimed that Tyson had torn a ligament in his knee in the first round. This was Tyson&#x27;s fifth career defeat. He underwent surgery for the ligament four days after the fight. His manager, Shelly Finkel, claimed that Tyson was unable to throw significant right-hand punches since he had a knee injury.

==Retirement==
=== Tyson vs. McBride ===

On June 11, 2005, Tyson quit before the start of the seventh round in a close bout against journeyman Kevin McBride. In the 2008 documentary &quot;Tyson&quot;, he stated that he fought McBride for a payday, that he did not anticipate winning, that he was in poor physical condition and fed up with taking boxing seriously. After losing three of his last four fights, Tyson said he would quit boxing because he felt he had lost his passion for the sport.

In 2000 Tyson dismissed everyone who was working for him and enlisted new accountants, who prepared a statement showing he started the year $3.3 million in debt but earned $65.7 million. In August 2007, Tyson pleaded guilty to drug possession and driving under the influence in an Arizona court, which stemmed from an arrest in December where authorities said Tyson, who has a long history of legal contentions, admitted to using cocaine that day and to being addicted to the drug.

In his 2013 autobiography &quot;Undisputed Truth&quot;, Tyson admitted to using the urine of his then wife Monica Turner to pass doping tests. He was married to Turner from 1997 to 2003. He also used his infant&#x27;s urine for the same purpose.

===Exhibition bouts and 2024 sanctioned fight===
====Mike Tyson&#x27;s World Tour====
To help pay off his debts, Tyson announced he would be doing a series of exhibition bouts, calling it Tyson&#x27;s World Tour. For his first bout, Tyson returned to the ring in 2006 for a four-round exhibition against journeyman heavyweight Corey Sanders in Youngstown, Ohio. Tyson, without headgear at 5 ft 10 in and 216 pounds, was in quality shape, but far from his prime against Sanders, at 6 ft 6 in who wore headgear. Tyson appeared to be &quot;holding back&quot; in the exhibition to prevent an early end to the &quot;show&quot;. &quot;If I don&#x27;t get out of this financial quagmire there&#x27;s a possibility I may have to be a punching bag for somebody. The money I make isn&#x27;t going to help my bills from a tremendous standpoint, but I&#x27;m going to feel better about myself. I&#x27;m not going to be depressed&quot;, explained Tyson about the reasons for his &quot;comeback&quot;. After the bout was poorly received by fans, the remainder of the tour was canceled.

====Tyson vs. Jones====

It was announced in July 2020 that Tyson had signed a contract to face former four-division world champion, Roy Jones Jr., in an eight-round exhibition fight. Mixed martial arts coach Rafael Cordeiro was selected to be Tyson&#x27;s trainer and cornerman. The bout—officially sanctioned by the California State Athletic Commission (CSAC)—was initially scheduled to take place on September 12 at the Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California, however, the date was pushed back to November 28 in order to maximize revenue for the event. The fight went the full eight rounds and was declared a draw. The fight was a split draw and the three judges scored the fight as follows: Chad Dawson (76–76 draw), Christy Martin (79–73 for Tyson), and Vinny Pazienza (76–80 for Jones).

==== Tyson vs. Paul ====

In March 2024, it was announced that Tyson would be making his ring return against Jake Paul in a heavyweight bout on July 20, 2024, at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. On April 29, 2024, it was announced that the fight would be sanctioned as a professional boxing match by Texas Department of Licensing and Regulations (TDLR). On May 26, 2024, Tyson suffered an ulcer flare-up aboard a plane. On May 31, 2024, it was announced that the fight was postponed per medical advice from Tyson&#x27;s doctor, allowing him to recover from his ulcer flare-up. On June 7, 2024, it was announced that the fight would take place at the same stadium on November 15, 2024.

Paul defeated Tyson via unanimous decision with the judges scoring the bout 80–72, 79–73 and 79–73 in favor of Paul.

== Mike Tyson&#x27;s Legends Only League ==

In July 2020, Mike Tyson announced the creation of Mike Tyson&#x27;s Legends Only League. Tyson formed the league in partnership with Sophie Watts and her company, Eros Innovations. The league provides retired professional athletes the opportunity to compete in their respective sport. On November 28, 2020, Mike Tyson fought Roy Jones Jr. at the Staples Center in the first event produced under Legends Only League. The event received largely positive reviews and was the highest selling PPV event of 2020, which ranks in the Top-10 for PPV purchased events all-time.

==Legacy==
Tyson was &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s Fighter of the Year in 1986 and 1988. A 1998 ranking of &quot;The Greatest Heavyweights of All-Time&quot; by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine placed Tyson at number 14 on the list. Despite criticism of facing underwhelming competition during his run as champion, Tyson&#x27;s knockout power and intimidation factor made him the sport&#x27;s most dynamic box-office draw. According to Douglas Quenqua of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The [1990s] began with Mike Tyson, considered by many to be the last great heavyweight champion, losing his title to the little-known Buster Douglas. Seven years later, Mr. Tyson bit Evander Holyfield&#x27;s ear in a heavyweight champion bout—hardly a proud moment for the sport.&quot;

He is remembered for his attire of black trunks, black shoes with no socks, and a plain white towel fit around his neck in place of a traditional robe, as well as his habit of rapidly pacing the ring before the start of a fight. In his prime, Tyson rarely took a step back and had never been knocked down or seriously challenged. According to &quot;Martial Arts World Report&quot;, it gave Tyson an Honorable Mention in its Ten Greatest Heavyweights of All Time rather than a ranking because longevity is a factor and the peak period of Tyson&#x27;s career lasted only about 5 years.

BoxRec currently ranks Tyson at number 20 among the greatest boxers that had their last fight at heavyweight. In &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years, released in 2002, Tyson was ranked at number 72. He is ranked number 16 on &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2003 list of 100 greatest punchers of all time. Tyson has defeated 11 boxers for the world heavyweight title, the seventh-most in history.

On June 12, 2011, Tyson was inducted to the International Boxing Hall of Fame alongside legendary Mexican champion Julio César Chávez, light welterweight champion Kostya Tszyu, and actor/screenwriter Sylvester Stallone. In 2011, Bleacher Report omitted Tyson from its list of top 10 heavyweights, saying that &quot;Mike Tyson is not a top 10 heavyweight. He killed the fighters he was supposed to beat, but when he fought another elite fighter, he always lost. I&#x27;m not talking about some of those B-level fighters he took a belt from. I&#x27;m talking about the handful of good boxers he fought throughout his career.&quot;

In 2013, Tyson was inducted into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame and headlined the induction ceremony. Tyson was inducted into the Southern Nevada Hall of Fame in 2015 along with four other inductees with ties to Southern Nevada.

Tyson reflected on his strongest opponents in ten categories for a 2014 interview with &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine, including best jab, best defense, fastest hands, fastest feet, best chin, smartest, strongest, best puncher, best boxer, and best overall.

In 2017, &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine ranked Tyson as number 9 of 20 heavyweight champions based on a poll of panelists that included trainers, matchmakers, media, historians, and boxers, including:

* Trainers: Teddy Atlas, Pat Burns, Virgil Hunter, and Don Turner
* Matchmakers: Eric Bottjer, Don Chargin, Don Elbaum, Bobby Goodman, Ron Katz, Mike Marchionte, Russell Peltz, and Bruce Trampler.
* Media: Al Bernstein, Ron Borges, Gareth A Davies, Norm Frauenheim, Jerry Izenberg, Harold Lederman, Paulie Malignaggi, Dan Rafael, and Michael Rosenthal
* Historians: Craig Hamilton, Steve Lott, Don McRae, Bob Mee, Clay Moyle, Adam Pollack, and Randy Roberts
* Boxers: Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson participated in the poll, but neither fighter ranked himself. Instead, a weighted average from the other panelists was assigned to their respective slots on their ballots.

In 2020, Bill Caplan of &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine listed Tyson as number 17 of the 20 greatest heavyweights of all time. Tyson spoke with &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine in 2020 about his six greatest victories, those over Trevor Berbick, Pinklon Thomas, Tony Tucker, Tyrell Biggs, Larry Holmes, and Michael Spinks. In 2020, CBS Sports boxing experts Brian Campbell and Brent Brookhouse ranked the top 10 heavyweights of the last 50 years and Tyson was ranked number 7.

== Trial and incarceration ==
Tyson was arrested in July 1991 for the rape of 18-year-old Desiree Washington at the Canterbury Hotel in Indianapolis. Washington, who had previously been crowned &quot;Miss Black Rhode Island&quot;, was a contestant in the Miss Black America pageant, rehearsals for which were being held in the city. Tyson was charged with &quot;one count of rape, two counts of criminal deviate conduct, and one count of criminal confinement—charges that carried a maximum sentence of 63 years.&quot; Tyson&#x27;s rape trial at the Marion County superior court lasted from January 26 to February 10, 1992.

Washington herself testified that Tyson had &quot;called her around 1:45 a.m. to tour the city, then picked her up in his limo, took her back to his room, and made small talk as they both sat on the bed.&quot; After propositioning her for sex, Washington stated that she firmly refused and went to use the bathroom before leaving. &quot;After using the bathroom, she said, she noticed some discharge on her panty shield. Washington said she removed the liner and threw it away.&quot; When she came out, &quot;Tyson then pulled her to the bed, pinned her down and raped her, she testified. &#x27;He was mean, evil,&#x27; she said. &#x27;I got on top and started to try to get away, but he slammed me down again.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Three days after the assault, Washington went to the police and accused Tyson of rape.&quot; Partial corroboration of Washington&#x27;s story came via testimony from Tyson&#x27;s chauffeur, Virginia Foster, who confirmed Desiree Washington&#x27;s &quot;state of shock&quot; after the incident. Foster also testified that Tyson had previously attempted to sexually assault her, too, having &quot;lured her to his hotel room, tried to touch her, and then exposed himself&quot;. Further testimony came from the emergency room physician, Dr. Thomas Richardson, who examined Washington after the incident and confirmed that Washington&#x27;s physical condition was consistent with rape. Richardson testified that Washington had suffered &quot;two small vaginal abrasions, consistent with 20 to 30 percent of the injuries seen in sexual assault cases&quot;, and that in approximately 20,000 cases over a period of 20 years, &quot;only twice [...] had he ever seen such abrasions following consensual sex.&quot;

Under lead defense lawyer Vincent J. Fuller&#x27;s direct examination, Tyson claimed that everything had taken place with Washington&#x27;s full consent and he claimed not to have forced himself upon her. When he was cross-examined by lead prosecutor Gregory Garrison, Tyson denied claims that he had misled Washington and insisted that she wanted to have sex with him. &quot;In a misguided attempt to show that Washington must have known that Tyson wanted sex, the defense called witness after witness to testify about their client&#x27;s lewd remarks and crude behavior during his encounters with the Miss Black America contestants, and even with Washington herself.&quot; Former attorney Mark Shaw argued that Tyson&#x27;s &quot;case was mishandled, citing a jury-selection process that allowed a conservative ex-Marine to become foreman, a defense &quot;strategy&quot; of making Tyson look as bad as possible, and a disastrous decision to allow the defendant to testify at the grand jury hearing, the trial, and his sentencing.&quot;

Despite Fuller&#x27;s reputation as:

Fuller had also successfully defended Tyson&#x27;s manager, Don King, &quot;against federal tax-evasion charges&quot; in 1985, which may have been one of the reasons King chose him to represent Tyson. Tyson himself would later describe Fuller as &quot;a horrible lawyer&quot;. According to Shaw, Fuller &quot;never challenged obvious problems in Washington’s story. Exactly why did she remove her panty shield? How did Tyson perform oral sex on her and still keep her pinned to the bed? If Tyson is one of the strongest men in the world, where were the bruises on the 108-pound woman?&quot;

Tyson was convicted of the rape charge on February 10, 1992, after the jury deliberated for nearly 10 hours.

Alan Dershowitz, acting as Tyson&#x27;s counsel, filed an appeal urging error of law in the Court&#x27;s exclusion of evidence of the victim&#x27;s past sexual conduct (known as the Rape Shield Law; Dershowitz alleged that Washington had &quot;falsely accused one of her high school classmates of rape&quot;), the exclusion of three potential defense witnesses, and the lack of jury instructions on honest and reasonable mistake of fact. The Indiana Court of Appeals ruled against Tyson in a 2–1 vote. The Indiana Supreme Court let the lower court opinion stand due to a 2–2 split in its review. The tie vote was due to the fact that the Chief Justice, Randall T. Shepard, recused himself from the case. The Chief Justice later revealed he did so because of a heated argument between his wife and Dershowitz at a Yale Law School reunion concerning the case. On March 26, 1992, Tyson was sentenced to six years in prison along with four years of probation. He was assigned to the Indiana Youth Center (now the Plainfield Correctional Facility) in April 1992, and he was released in March 1995 after serving less than three years of the sentence. He left with prison tattoos of tennis player Arthur Ashe and Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong; Tyson also dates his tattoo of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara to this time.

Due to his conviction, Tyson was required to register as a Tier II sex offender under federal law. Tyson has continued to maintain his innocence. In 1992, Erinn Cosby, the daughter of comedian and actor Bill Cosby, publicly accused Tyson of sexually assaulting her in 1989, although no criminal charges were ever sought.

==Life outside of boxing==

In an interview with &quot;USA Today&quot; published on June 3, 2005, Tyson said, &quot;My whole life has been a waste – I&#x27;ve been a failure.&quot; He continued: &quot;I just want to escape. I&#x27;m really embarrassed with myself and my life. I want to be a missionary. I think I could do that while keeping my dignity without letting people know they chased me out of the country. I want to get this part of my life over as soon as possible. In this country nothing good is going to come of me. People put me so high; I wanted to tear that image down.&quot; Tyson began to spend much of his time tending to his 350 pigeons in Paradise Valley, an upscale enclave near Phoenix, Arizona.

Tyson has stayed in the limelight by promoting various websites and companies. In the past Tyson had shunned endorsements, accusing other athletes of putting on a false front to obtain them. Tyson has held entertainment boxing shows at a casino in Las Vegas and started a tour of exhibition bouts to pay off his numerous debts.

In October 2012, Tyson launched the Mike Tyson Cares Foundation. The mission of the Mike Tyson Cares Foundation is to &quot;give kids a fighting chance&quot; with innovative centers that provide for the comprehensive needs of kids from broken homes.

In August 2013, Tyson teamed up with Acquinity Sports to form Iron Mike Productions, a boxing promotions company.

In September 2013, Tyson was featured on a six-episode television series on Fox Sports 1 that documented his personal and private life entitled &quot;Being: Mike Tyson&quot;.
In November 2013, Tyson&#x27;s &quot;Undisputed Truth&quot; was published, which appeared on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. At the Golden Podium Awards Ceremony, Tyson received the Sportel Special Prize for the best autobiography.

In May 2017, Tyson published his second memoir, &quot;Iron Ambition&quot;, which details his time with trainer and surrogate father Cus D&#x27;Amato. Both were written with Larry Sloman.
In February 2018, Tyson attended the international mixed martial arts (MMA) tournament in the Russian city of Chelyabinsk. Tyson said: &quot;As I have travelled all over the country of Russia I have realised that the people are very sensitive and kind. But most Americans do not have any experience of that.&quot;

On May 12, 2020, Tyson posted a video on his Instagram of him training again. At the end of the video, Tyson hinted at a return to boxing by saying, &quot;I&#x27;m back&quot;.

On May 23, 2020, at All Elite Wrestling&#x27;s Double or Nothing, Tyson helped Cody defeat Lance Archer alongside Jake Roberts and presented him the inaugural AEW TNT Championship. Tyson alongside Henry Cejudo, Rashad Evans, and Vitor Belfort appeared on the May 27 episode of &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot; facing off against Chris Jericho and his stable The Inner Circle. Tyson returned to AEW on the April 7, 2021, episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot; and helped Jericho from being attacked by The Pinnacle, beating down Shawn Spears in the process. He was the special guest enforcer on the April 14 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot; for a match between Jericho and Dax Harwood of The Pinnacle, a preview of the upcoming Inner Circle vs. Pinnacle match at Blood and Guts.

Tyson made an extended cameo appearance in the Telugu-Hindi movie &quot;Liger&quot;, which released on August 25, 2022.

==Personal life==
=== Marriages and children ===
Tyson resides in Seven Hills, Nevada. He has been married three times, and has seven children, one deceased, with three women; in addition to his biological children, Tyson includes his second wife&#x27;s oldest daughter as one of his own.

Tyson married actress Robin Givens on February 7, 1988, at Holy Angels Catholic Church during a traditional ceremony in Chicago. Givens was known at the time for her role on the sitcom &quot;Head of the Class.&quot; Tyson&#x27;s marriage to Givens was especially tumultuous, with allegations of violence, spousal abuse, and mental instability on Tyson&#x27;s part.

Matters came to a head when Tyson and Givens gave a joint interview with Barbara Walters on the ABC TV news magazine show &quot;20/20&quot; in September 1988, in which Givens described life with Tyson as &quot;torture, pure hell, worse than anything I could possibly imagine.&quot; Givens also described Tyson as &quot;manic depressive&quot; – which was later confirmed by doctors – on national television while Tyson looked on with an intent and calm expression. A month later, Givens announced that she was seeking a divorce from the allegedly abusive Tyson, with the two officially separating on February 14, 1989.

According to the book &quot;Fire and Fear: The Inside Story of Mike Tyson&quot;, Tyson admitted that he punched Givens and stated, &quot;that was the best punch I&#x27;ve ever thrown in my entire life.&quot; Tyson claimed that the book was &quot;filled with inaccuracies.&quot; Tyson and Givens had no children, but she reported having had a miscarriage; Tyson claimed that she was never pregnant and only used that to get him to marry her. During their marriage, the couple lived in a mansion in Bernardsville, New Jersey.

Tyson&#x27;s second marriage was to Monica Turner from April 19, 1997, to January 14, 2003. At the time of the divorce filing, Turner worked as a pediatric resident at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C. She is the sister of Michael Steele, the former Lieutenant Governor of Maryland and former Republican National Committee chairman. Turner filed for divorce from Tyson in January 2002, claiming that he committed adultery during their five-year marriage, an act that &quot;has neither been forgiven nor condoned.&quot; The couple had two children.

On May 25, 2009, Tyson&#x27;s four-year-old daughter, Exodus, was found by her seven-year-old brother, unconscious and tangled in a cord, dangling from an exercise treadmill. The child&#x27;s mother untangled her, administered CPR and called for medical attention. Tyson, who was in Las Vegas at the time of the incident, traveled back to Phoenix to be with her. She died of her injuries on May 26, 2009.

Eleven days after his daughter&#x27;s death, Tyson wed for the third time, to longtime girlfriend Lakiha &quot;Kiki&quot; Spicer, age 32, exchanging vows on June 6, 2009, in a short, private ceremony at the La Bella Wedding Chapel at the Las Vegas Hilton. They have two children.

=== Religious beliefs ===
Raised as a Catholic, Tyson has stated that he converted to Islam before entering prison and that he made no efforts to correct what was reported in the media, although it was falsely reported that he converted to Islam during his time in prison and adopted the Muslim name Malik Abdul Aziz; some sources report it as Malik Shabazz. Tyson never changed his given name to an Islamic one, despite the rumors.

In November 2013, Tyson stated &quot;the more I look into the churches and mosques for god, the more I start seeing the devil&quot;. But, just a month later, in a December 2013 interview with Fox News, Tyson said that he is very grateful to be a Muslim and that he needs Allah in his life. In the same interview Tyson talked about his progress with sobriety and how being in the company of good people has made him want to be a better and more humble person.

He first completed the Islamic pilgrimage Umrah in July 2010 and more recently in December 2022 accompanied by DJ Khaled, a Palestinian American Muslim.

=== Diet ===
In March 2011, Tyson appeared on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; to discuss his new Animal Planet reality series &quot;Taking On Tyson&quot;. In the interview with DeGeneres, Tyson discussed some of the ways he had improved his life in the past two years, including sober living and a vegan diet. However, in August 2013 he admitted publicly that he had lied about his sobriety and was on the verge of death from alcoholism.

Tyson also revealed that he is no longer vegan, stating, &quot;I was a vegan for four years but not anymore. I eat chicken every now and then. I should be a vegan. [No red meat] at all, no way! I would be very sick if I ate red meat. That&#x27;s probably why I was so crazy before.&quot;

=== Political views ===
In 2015, Tyson announced that he was supporting Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential candidacy.

=== Controversies and legal challenges ===
On December 29, 2006, Tyson was arrested in Scottsdale, Arizona, on suspicion of DUI and felony drug possession; he nearly crashed into a police SUV shortly after leaving a nightclub. According to a police probable-cause statement, filed in Maricopa County Superior Court, &quot;[Tyson] admitted to using [drugs] today and stated he is an addict and has a problem.&quot; Tyson pleaded not guilty on January 22, 2007, in Maricopa County Superior Court to felony drug possession and paraphernalia possession counts and two misdemeanor counts of driving under the influence of drugs. On February 8 he checked himself into an inpatient treatment program for &quot;various addictions&quot; while awaiting trial on the drug charges.

On September 24, 2007, Tyson pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine and driving under the influence. He was convicted of these charges in November 2007 and sentenced to 24 hours in jail. After his release, he was ordered to serve three years&#x27; probation and complete 360 hours of community service. Prosecutors had requested a year-long jail sentence, but the judge praised Tyson for seeking help with his drug problems. On November 11, 2009, Tyson was arrested after getting into a scuffle at Los Angeles International airport with a photographer. No charges were filed.

In September 2011, Tyson gave an interview in which he made comments about former Alaska governor Sarah Palin including crude and violent descriptions of interracial sex. These comments were reprinted on &quot;The Daily Caller&quot; website. Journalist Greta van Susteren criticized Tyson and &quot;The Daily Caller&quot; over the comments, which she described as &quot;smut&quot; and &quot;violence against women&quot;.

On April 20, 2022, on a JetBlue flight from San Francisco to Florida, Tyson repeatedly punched a male passenger who was harassing him, including throwing water on Tyson; he did not face criminal charges.

In 2023, an unnamed woman filed a $5 million lawsuit against Tyson, accusing him of raping her in his limousine in the early 90s. She accused Tyson of kissing her several times before pulling off her pants and raping her, despite repeatedly telling him to stop. The woman claims to have experienced &quot;guilt, loss of self-esteem, shame, embarrassment, sadness, anger, depression, anxiety, violent tendencies, drug and alcohol addiction and confusion&quot;, as well as inability &quot;to maintain and/or develop healthy relationships with men or other people in general&quot;.

In November 2023, Tyson found himself amidst criticism and rumors regarding his alleged donation to the Israeli Defense Forces after he was photographed attending a November 13 event sponsored by Friends of the IDF (FIDF) to fundraise for the Israel–Hamas war, which seemed to clash with his previous statements about Palestinians. This led to a social media backlash, prompting Tyson to release the following statement on Instagram: &quot;I want to clarify the recent portrayal of an event I attended,&quot; he wrote on Thursday. &quot;Invited for a casual evening out by a friend, I was unaware of the arranged fundraiser and no donations were made by me or on my behalf. As a Muslim and human, I support peace. My prayers have been and continue to be with my brothers and sisters.&quot;
