<text>Soho is an area of the City of Westminster in the West End of London. Originally a fashionable district for the aristocracy, it has been one of the main entertainment districts in the capital since the 19th century.

The area was developed from farmland by Henry VIII in 1536, when it became a royal park. It became a parish in its own right in the late 17th century, when buildings started to be developed for the upper class, including the laying out of Soho Square in the 1680s. St Anne&#x27;s Church was established during the late 17th century, and remains a significant local landmark; other churches are the Church of Our Lady of the Assumption and St Gregory and St Patrick&#x27;s Church in Soho Square. The aristocracy had mostly moved away by the mid-19th century, when Soho was particularly badly hit by an outbreak of cholera in 1854. For much of the 20th century Soho had a reputation as a base for the sex industry in addition to its night life and its location for the headquarters of leading film companies. Since the 1980s, the area has undergone considerable gentrification. It is now predominantly a fashionable district of upmarket restaurants and media offices, with only a small remnant of sex industry venues. London&#x27;s most prominent gay village is centred on Old Compton Street in Soho.

Soho&#x27;s reputation as a major entertainment district of London stems from theatres such as the Windmill Theatre on Great Windmill Street and the Raymond Revuebar owned by entrepreneur Paul Raymond, and music clubs such as the 2i&#x27;s Coffee Bar and the Marquee Club. Trident Studios was based in Soho, and the nearby Denmark Street has hosted numerous music publishing houses and instrument shops from the 20th century onwards. The independent British film industry centres on Soho, including the British headquarters of Twentieth Century Fox and the British Board of Film Classification offices. The area has been popular for restaurants since the 19th century, including the long-standing Kettner&#x27;s which was visited by numerous celebrities. Near to Soho is London&#x27;s Chinatown, centred on Gerrard Street and containing several restaurants and shops.

==Name==
The name &quot;Soho&quot; first appears in the 17th century. The name is derived from a former hunting cry. James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, used &quot;soho&quot; as a rallying call for his men at the Battle of Sedgemoor on 6 July 1685, half a century after the name was first used for this area of London.

The Soho name has been reused by other entertainment and restaurant districts such as SoHo, Hong Kong, which derives its name from being located south of Hollywood Road, and the cultural and commercial area of Soho in Málaga, Spain. The New York City neighbourhood of SoHo, Manhattan, gets its name from its location south of Houston Street, but is also a reference to London&#x27;s Soho. The Pittsburgh neighbourhood of Uptown was also formerly called Soho, most likely having been named by its founder James Tustin after the London district, though it may refer to Soho, West Midlands.

==Location==

Soho has never been an administrative unit with formally defined boundaries; it is about in area, and is usually considered to be bounded by Shaftesbury Avenue to the south, Oxford Street to the north, Regent Street to the west, and Charing Cross Road to the east. Apart from Oxford Street, all of these roads are 19th-century metropolitan improvements. The area to the west is known as Mayfair, to the north Fitzrovia, to the east St Giles and Covent Garden, and to the south St James&#x27;s. Soho is part of the West End electoral ward which elects three councillors to Westminster City Council.

The nearest London Underground stations are Oxford Circus, Piccadilly Circus, Tottenham Court Road, Leicester Square and Covent Garden.

==History==

===Early history===
During the Middle Ages, the area that is now Soho was farmland that belonged to the Abbot and Convent of Abingdon and the master of Burton St Lazar Hospital in Leicestershire, who managed a leper hospital in St Giles in the Fields. In 1536, the land was taken by Henry VIII as a royal park for the Palace of Whitehall. The area south of what is now Shaftesbury Avenue did not stay in the Crown possession for long; Queen Mary sold around in 1554, and most of the remainder was sold between 1590 and 1623. A small section of land remained, until sold by Charles II in 1676.

In the 1660s, ownership of Soho Fields passed to Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans, who leased 19 out of the of land to Joseph Girle. He was granted permission to develop property and quickly passed the lease and development to bricklayer Richard Frith. Much of the land was granted freehold in 1698 by William III to William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland, while the southern part of Soho was sold piecemeal in the 16th and 17th centuries, partly to Robert Sidney, Earl of Leicester.

Soho was part of the ancient parish of St Martin in the Fields, forming part of the Liberty of Westminster. As the population started to grow, a new church was provided, and in 1687 a new parish of St Anne was established for it. The parish stretched from Oxford Street in the north to Leicester Square in the south and from what is now Charing Cross Road in the east to Wardour Street in the west; it therefore included all of contemporary eastern Soho, including the Chinatown area. The western portion of modern Soho, around Carnaby Street, was part of the parish of St James, which was split off from St Martin in 1686.

===Gentrification===
Building progressed rapidly in the late 17th century, with large properties such as Monmouth House (built for James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, Charles II&#x27;s eldest illegitimate son), Leicester House, Fauconberg House, Carlisle House and Newport House.

Soho Square was first laid out in the 1680s on the former Soho Fields; by 1691, 41 houses had been completed there. It was originally called King Square in honour of Charles II, and a statue of him was based in the centre. Several upper-class families moved into the area, including those of Richard Graham, 1st Viscount Preston, and Edward Howard, 2nd Earl of Carlisle. The square had become known as Soho Square by 1720, at which point it had fashionable houses on all sides. Only No 10 and No 15 from this period have survived into the 21st century.

Though the Earls of Leicester and Portland had intended Soho to be an upper-class estate comparable to Bloomsbury, Marylebone and Mayfair, it never developed as such. Immigrants began to settle in the area from around 1680 onwards, particularly French Huguenots after 1688. The area became known as London&#x27;s French quarter. The French church in Soho Square was founded by Huguenots and opened on 25 March 1893, with a façade of terracotta and coloured brick designed by Aston Webb.

===Cholera outbreak===

A significant event in the history of epidemiology and public health was John Snow&#x27;s study of an 1854 outbreak of cholera in Soho. He identified the cause of the outbreak as water from the public pump at the junction of Broad Street (now Broadwick Street) and Cambridge Street (now Lexington Street), close to the rear wall of what is today the John Snow public house.

Snow mapped the addresses of the sick and noted that they were mostly people whose nearest access to water was the Broad Street pump. He persuaded the authorities to remove the handle of the pump, thus preventing any more of the infected water from being collected. The spring below the pump was later found to have been contaminated with sewage. This is an early example of epidemiology, public health medicine and the application of science—the germ theory of disease—in a real-life crisis. Science writer Steven Johnson has written about the changes related to the cholera outbreak, and notes that almost every building on the street that existed in 1854 has since been replaced. A replica of the pump, with a memorial plaque and without a handle (to signify Snow&#x27;s action to halt the outbreak) was erected in 1992 near the location of the original.

===Decline===
By the mid-18th century, the aristocrats who had been living in Soho Square or Gerrard Street had moved away, as more fashionable areas such as Mayfair became available. The historian and topographer William Maitland wrote that the parish &quot;so greatly abound with French that is an easy Matter for a Stranger to imagine himself in France.&quot; Soho&#x27;s character stems partly from the ensuing neglect by rich and fashionable London, and the lack of the redevelopment that characterised the neighbouring areas.

The aristocracy had mostly disappeared from Soho by the 19th century, to be replaced by prostitutes, music halls and small theatres. The population increased significantly, reaching 327 inhabitants per acre by 1851, making the area one of the most densely populated areas of London. Houses became divided into tenements with chronic overcrowding and disease. The 1854 cholera outbreak caused the remaining upper-class families to leave the area. Numerous hospitals were built to cope with the health problem; six were constructed between 1851 and 1874. Businesses catering to household essentials were established at the same time.

The restaurant trade in Soho improved dramatically in the early 20th century. The construction of new theatres along Shaftesbury Avenue and Charing Cross Road improved the reputation of the area, and a meal for theatre-goers became common. Public houses in Soho increased in popularity during the 1930s and were frequented by struggling authors, poets and artists.

===Recent history===

Since the decline of the sex industry in Soho in the 1980s, the area has returned to being more residential. The Soho Housing Association was established in 1976 to provide reasonable rented accommodation. By the 21st century, it had acquired around 400 flats. St Anne&#x27;s Church in Dean Street was refurbished after decades of neglect, and a Museum of Soho was established.

On 30 April 1999, the Admiral Duncan pub on Old Compton Street, which serves the gay community, was damaged by a nail bomb that left three dead and 30 injured. The bomb was the third that had been planted by David Copeland, a neo-Nazi who was attempting to stir up ethnic and homophobic tensions by carrying out a series of bombings.

In early February 2020, parts of an unexploded Second World War bomb was discovered by construction workers developing a new mixed residential building in Richmond Mews, near Dean Street. Residents, employees, and pedestrians on Richmond Mews, Dean Street, Meard Street and St Anne&#x27;s Court were evacuated on both the 3 and 4 February 2020. All road junctions connecting to the streets closed during retrieval of the bomb fragments as well.

===Theatre and film===

Soho is near the heart of London&#x27;s theatre area. It is home to the Soho Theatre, built in 2000 to present new plays and comedy.

The Windmill Theatre was based on Great Windmill Street, and was named after a windmill at this location that was demolished in the 18th century. It initially opened as the Palais de Luxe in 1910 as a small cinema, but was unable to compete with larger venues and was converted into a theatre by Howard Jones. It re-opened in December 1931, but was still unsuccessful. In 1932, the general manager Vivian Van Damm introduced a non-stop variety show throughout the afternoon and evening. It was famous for its nude &quot;tableaux vivants&quot;, in which the models had to remain motionless to avoid the censorship laws then in place. The theatre claimed that, aside from a compulsory closure between 4 and 16 September 1939, it was the only theatre in London which did not close during the Second World War; this led it to use the slogan &quot;We never closed&quot;. Several prominent comedians including Harry Secombe, Jimmy Edwards and Tony Hancock began their careers at the Windmill. It closed on 31 October 1964 and was again turned into a cinema.

The Raymond Revuebar at No. 11 Walker&#x27;s Court was a small theatre specialising in striptease and nude dancing. It was owned by Paul Raymond and opened in 1958. The facade supported a brightly lit sign declaring it to be the &quot;World Centre of Erotic Entertainment&quot;. Raymond subsequently bought the lease of the Windmill and ran it as a &quot;nude entertainment&quot; venue until 1981. The upstairs became known as the Boulevard Theatre and in 1980 was adopted as a comedy club called &quot;The Comic Strip&quot; by a small group of alternative comedians including Rik Mayall, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Alexei Sayle and Adrian Edmondson, before they found wider recognition with the series &quot;The Comic Strip Presents&quot; on Channel 4. The name and control of the theatre (but not the property itself) were bought by Raymond&#x27;s business associate Gérard Simi in 1996. The theatre suffered financial difficulties owing to increasing rent, leading to its closure in 2004. It became a gay bar and cabaret venue called Too2Much; in 2005, Elton John staged a joint bachelor party there with his longtime partner David Furnish in anticipation of their civil partnership. The venue was subsequently renamed to the Soho Revue Bar, but closed in 2009.

Soho is a centre of the independent film and video industry as well as the television and film post-production industry. Audio post duo White Lightning (Robbie Weston and Rick Dzendzera) opened two audio post-production facilities in different parts of Soho between 1978 and 1987: Silk Sound at 13 Berwick Street, and The Bridge Facilities at 55-57 Great Marlborough Street. Silk Sound was acquired by Bubble TV in 2010, and was rebranded under Bubble&#x27;s banner in 2018, while The Bridge went defunct altogether in 2009. White Lightning also opened a third studio at 16 Dufours Place, named Space Facilities, in late 1995. However, Space closed in 2008, just a year before The Bridge did. Twentieth Century House in Soho Square was built in 1937 for Twentieth Century Fox. Since 1947, Soho has also been home to De Lane Lea Studios, which is currently owned by Warner Bros. The British Board of Film Classification, formerly known as the British Board of Film Censors, has been based in Soho Square since 1950. Soho&#x27;s key fibre communications network has been managed by Sohonet since 1995, which connects the Soho media and post-production community to British film studios such as Pinewood and Shepperton, along with other locations worldwide include HBO and Warner Brothers. In the 2010s, research commissioned by Westminster City Council showed 23 per cent of the workforce in Soho worked in the creative industries.

===Restaurants and clubs===

Many small and easily affordable restaurants and cafes were established in Soho during the 19th century, particularly as a result of Greek and Italian immigration. The restaurants were not looked upon favourably at first, but their reputation changed at the start of the 20th century. In 1924, a guide reported &quot;of late years, the inexpensive restaurants of Soho have enjoyed an extraordinary vogue.&quot; Arthur Ransome&#x27;s &quot;Bohemia in London&quot; (1907) mentions Old and New Soho, including details about Soho coffee-houses including The Moorish Café and The Algerian.

Kettner&#x27;s was a restaurant on Romilly Street, established in 1867 by Napoleon III&#x27;s chef Auguste Kettner. It was frequently visited by Albert, Prince of Wales (where he is alleged to have dined with his mistress, Lillie Langtry) and Oscar Wilde. The restaurant survived both World Wars without incident, and was regularly visited by Agatha Christie and Bing Crosby.

In the 20th century, several Soho pubs and private members clubs gained notoriety for both their proprietors and clientele. Clive Jennings says of regular clientele such as Jeffrey Barnard and Francis Bacon that &quot;the lethal triangle of The French, The Coach &amp; Horses and The Colony were the staging points of the Dean Street shuffle, with occasional forays into other joints such as The Gargoyle or the Mandrake ... The Groucho or Blacks&quot;. Christopher Howse notes of the coterie of bohemian heavy drinkers that &quot;There was no worry about pensions in Soho. People didn&#x27;t live that long.&quot;

The Gargoyle Club opened at 69 Dean Street in 1925. It was founded by the socialite the Hon David Tennant as a place where writers, artists and musicians could mingle with the upper crust and eat and drink at affordable prices for the next three decades. In May 1979 the Gargoyle&#x27;s uppermost room started hosting a weekly club-night on Saturdays called the Comedy Store, which made the reputations of many of the UK&#x27;s upcoming &quot;alternative comedians&quot;. Among the original lineup here were Alexei Sayle, Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson who broke away in 1980 to establish The Comic Strip team at Raymond&#x27;s Revue Bar, before they found wider recognition with the series &quot;The Comic Strip Presents&quot; on Channel 4. The Gargoyle&#x27;s success and Bohemian clientele led to other restaurants being founded around Soho, including the Eiffel Tower and Bellotti&#x27;s.

During the 1970s the building at 69 Dean Street housed another nightspot in its cellars, initially known as Billy&#x27;s, and run by Soho&#x27;s only Jamaican club owner, Vince Howard. The Blitz Kids, a group of London clubgoers who spearheaded the New Romantic movement in the early 1980s, originally met at Billy&#x27;s. The club changed its name to Gossip&#x27;s and became part of London&#x27;s clubland heritage by spawning several weekly club-nights that influenced British music and fashion during the 1980s.

Gerrard Street is the centre of London&#x27;s Chinatown, and along with Lisle Street and Little Newport Street, house a mix of import companies, oriental food shops and restaurants. Street festivals are held throughout the year, particularly on the Chinese New Year. In March 2022, Cadbury opened a temporary vegan chocolate shop at 15 Bateman Street.

===Radio===
Soho Radio is an internet radio station on Great Windmill Street, next to the Windmill Theatre. Since May 2014 it has been streaming live and pre-recorded programming from its premises, which also function as a retail space and coffee shop. The station states on its website that it aims &quot;to reflect the culture of Soho through our vibrant and diverse content&quot;. There is no playlist policy, and presenters are allowed to play any music they like. In 2016, it was voted the world&#x27;s best radio station at Mixcloud&#x27;s Online Radio Awards.

===Religion===

Soho is home to numerous religious and spiritual groups. St Anne&#x27;s Church on Wardour Street was built between 1677 and 1686, possibly to the design of Sir Christopher Wren or William Talman. An additional tower was built in 1717 by Talman and reconstructed in 1803. The church was damaged by a V1 flying bomb during World War II in 1940, but the tower survived. In 1976, John Betjeman campaigned to save the building. The church was fully restored in the late 1980s and formally re-opened by the Princess Royal on 12 March 1990. The Church of Our Lady of the Assumption and St Gregory on Warwick Street was built in 1788 and is the only remaining 18th-century Roman Catholic embassy chapel in London and principal church of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham. St Patrick&#x27;s Church in Soho Square was built in 1792 to accommodate Irish immigrants who had moved to the area.

Other religious buildings in Soho include the Hare Krishna Temple off Soho Square, which was part-funded by George Harrison and opened in 1979. There exists a small mosque on Berwick Street. The French Protestant Church of London, the only one of its kind in the city and constructed in the Flemish Gothic style, has been at Nos. 8–9 Soho Square since 1893.

===Music===
The music scene in Soho can be traced back to 1948 and Club Eleven, generally regarded as the first venue where modern jazz, or bebop, was performed in the UK. It closed in 1950 following a drugs raid. The Harmony Inn was a hang-out for musicians on Archer Street operating during the 1940s and 1950s.

The Ken Colyer Band&#x27;s 51 Club, a venue for traditional jazz, opened on Great Newport Street in 1951. Blues guitarist and harmonica player Cyril Davies and guitarist Bob Watson launched the London Skiffle Centre, London&#x27;s first skiffle club, on the first floor of the Roundhouse pub on Wardour Street in 1952. It was renamed the London Blues and Barrelhouse Club in the late 1950s, and closed in 1964.

In the early 1950s, Soho became the centre of the beatnik culture in London. The first coffee bar to open was Moka at No. 29 Frith Street. It was formally opened in 1953 by the film star Gina Lollobrigida, and the frothed coffee produced from stainless steel machines was pioneering in British culture. &quot;Le Macabre&quot; on Wardour Street, had coffin-shaped tables, fostered beat poetry, jive dance and political debate. The Goings On, in Archer Street, was a Sunday afternoon club organised by the beat poet Pete Brown, active in the mid-1960s. For the rest of the week, it operated as an illegal gambling den. Pink Floyd played at the club at the beginning of their career.

The 2i&#x27;s Coffee Bar was one of the first rock clubs in Europe. It initially opened on No. 44 Gerard Street in 1956, but soon moved to its more famous venue of No. 59 Old Compton Street. Soho quickly became the centre of the fledgling rock scene in London. Clubs included the Flamingo Club, a regular gig for Georgie Fame, Ronan O&#x27;Rahilly&#x27;s The Scene, which opened in 1963 and catered for the Mod movement with regular attendees including Steve Marriot and Andrew Loog Oldham, and jazz clubs like Ronnie Scott&#x27;s, which opened in 1959 at 39 Gerrard Street and moved to 47 Frith Street in 1965.
Soho&#x27;s Wardour Street was the home of the Marquee Club, which opened in 1958. In the 1960s, numerous major rock bands played at the venue, including early performances from the Rolling Stones in July 1962 and The Who in late 1964, Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, AC/DC and Iron Maiden. Eric Clapton and Brian Jones both lived for a time in Soho, sharing a flat with future rock publicist, Tony Brainsby.

Trident Studios was based at 17 St Anne&#x27;s Court, Soho and was a major London recording studio. It was established by Norman and Barry Sheffield in 1968, who wanted to expand from the small studio they had above their music shop. It became immediately successful after The Beatles decided to record several tracks on &quot;The White Album&quot; there, as the facilities were better than Abbey Road studios. Queen were originally managed by the Sheffields, and recorded their first four albums at Trident. Other artists who recorded at Trident include David Bowie, Elton John, Free and Thin Lizzy. It closed as a general-purpose recording studio in 1981, but has since reopened in various guises, including providing sound and mixing services for television.

Although technically not part of Soho, the adjacent Denmark Street is known for its connections with British popular music, and is nicknamed the British Tin Pan Alley due to its large concentration of shops selling musical instruments. The Sex Pistols lived beneath No. 6 and recorded their first demos there. Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones and David Bowie have all recorded at studios on Denmark Street and Elton John wrote his hit &quot;Your Song&quot; in the street. Led Zeppelin&#x27;s first rehearsal in 1968 was in a basement studio on Gerrard Street.

===Sex industry===

The Soho area has been at the heart of London&#x27;s sex industry for more than 200 years; between 1778 and 1801, 21 Soho Square was location of the White House, a brothel described by the magistrate Henry Mayhew as &quot;a notorious place of ill-fame&quot;. Shortly before World War I, two rival gangs, one led by Chan Nan (also called &quot;Brilliant Chang&quot;) and the other by Eddie Manning, controlled drugs and prostitution in Soho. Both were eventually arrested and imprisoned; Manning died midway through a three-year sentence in 1933. Following World War II, gangs set up rings of prostitutes in the area, concentrated around Brewer Street and Rupert Street. Photographers also visited Soho in the hope of being able to blackmail people caught in the act of visiting prostitutes.

When the Street Offences Act 1959 drove prostitution off the streets, many clubs such as the Blue Lagoon at No. 50 Carnaby Street became fronts for it. Gangs controlled the clubs and the prostitutes, and the police were bribed. In 1960 London&#x27;s first sex cinema, the Compton Cinema Club (a members-only club to get around the law), opened at 56 Old Compton Street. It was owned by Michael Klinger and Tony Tenser who later produced two early Roman Polanski films, including &quot;Repulsion&quot; (1965). As post-war austerity relaxed into the &quot;swinging &#x27;60s&quot;, clip joints also surfaced; these unlicensed establishments sold coloured water as champagne with the promise of sex to follow, thus fleecing tourists looking for a &quot;good time&quot;. Harrison Marks, a &quot;glamour photographer&quot; and girlie magazine publisher, had a photographic gallery on Gerrard Street and published several magazines in the 1950s and &#x27;60s. The model Pamela Green prompted him to take up nude photography, and she remained the creative force in their business.
By the 1970s, the sex shops had grown from the handful opened by Carl Slack in the early 1960s. From 1976 to 1982, Soho had 54 sex shops, 39 sex cinemas and cinema clubs, 16 strip and peep shows, 11 sex-oriented clubs and 12 licensed massage parlours. The proliferation of sex shops dissuaded some people from visiting Soho. The growth of the sex industry in Soho during this time was partly caused by corruption in the Metropolitan Police. The vice squad at the time suffered from police officers enforcing against organised crime in the area, while simultaneously accepting bribes. This changed following the appointment of Robert Mark as chief constable, who began to crack down on corruption. In 1972 local residents started the Soho Society in order to control the increasing expansion of the sex industry in the area and improve it with a comprehensive redevelopment plan. This led to a series of corruption trials in 1975, following which several senior police officers were imprisoned. This caused a small recession in Soho which depressed property values at the time Paul Raymond had started buying freeholds there.

By the 1980s, purges of the police force along with pressure from the Soho Society and new and tighter licensing controls by the City of Westminster led to a crackdown on illegal premises. The number of sex industry premises dropped from 185 in 1982 to around 30 in 1991. By 2000, substantial relaxation of general censorship, the ready availability of non-commercial sex, and the licensing or closing of unlicensed sex shops had reduced the red-light area to just a small area around Berwick Street. Much of the business has been reported to have been run by Albanian gangs. By the end of 2014, gentrification and competition from the internet had reduced the number of flats in Soho used for prostitution (see Soho walk-up), but the area remains a red-light district and a centre of the sex industry in London.

===Health and welfare===
The National Hospital for Diseases of the Heart and Paralysis was established at No. 32 Soho Square in 1874. The property had previously been owned by the naturalist and botanist Sir Joseph Banks. It moved to Westmoreland Street in 1914, and then to Fulham Road in 1991.

In July 2019, Soho was reported to be the unhealthiest place to live in Britain. Researchers from the University of Liverpool found that the area had the greatest access to takeaways, pubs and off-licences and these were combined with high levels of air pollution and low levels of parks and green spaces.
==Streets==
Berwick Street was built between 1687 and 1703, and is probably named after James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick, the illegitimate son of James II of England. It has held a street market since the early 18th century, which has been formally organised since 1892.

Carnaby Street was laid out in the late 17th century. It was named after Karnaby House, built on the street&#x27;s eastern side in 1683. It was a popular residence for Huguenots at first, before becoming populated by shops in the 19th century. In 1957, a fashion boutique was opened, and Carnaby Street became the fashion centre of 1960s Swinging London, although it quickly became known for poor quality &quot;kitsch&quot; products.
D&#x27;Arblay Street was laid out between 1735 and 1744. It was originally known as Portland Street after William Bentinck, 2nd Duke of Portland, and given its current named in 1909 in commemoration of Frances Burney, Madame D&#x27;Arblay, who had lived in Poland Street nearby, when she was young. The George public house at No. 1 was opened in 1889, but there has been a tavern on this site since 1739. Several of the original houses have survived into the 21st century.

Dean Street was built in the 1680s and was originally settled by French immigrants. It is home to the Soho Theatre and a pub known as The French House, which during the Second World War was popular with the French government-in-exile. Karl Marx lived at No. 64 Dean Street around 1850. The Colony Club was founded by Muriel Belcher and based at No. 41 Dean Street from 1948 to 2008. It was frequented by several important artists including Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud and Frank Auerbach.

Frith Street was named after Richard Frith, a local builder. On Rocque&#x27;s Map of London it is marked as Thrift Street. It was a popular aristocratic residence, although without as many foreign residents as some other streets. A plaque above the stage door of the Prince Edward Theatre identifies the site where Mozart lived as a child between 1764 and 1765. John Logie Baird first demonstrated television in his laboratory at No 22 in 1926; the site is now the location of Bar Italia. Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club is located at No 46 Frith Street, having moved there from Gerrard Street in 1965.

Greek Street was first laid out around 1680 and was named after a nearby Greek church. It initially housed several upper-class tenants including Arthur Annesley, 5th Earl of Anglesey, and Peter Plunket, 4th Earl of Fingall. Thomas De Quincey lived in the street after running away from Manchester Grammar School in 1802. Josiah Wedgwood ran his main pottery warehouse and showrooms at Nos. 12–13 between 1774 and 1797. The street now mostly contains restaurants, and several historical buildings from the early 18th century are still standing.

Gerrard Street was built between 1677 and 1685 on land, called the Military Ground, which was owned by Charles Gerard, 1st Earl of Macclesfield. The initial development contained a large house belonging to the Earl of Devonshire, which was subsequently occupied by Charles Montagu, 4th Earl of Manchester, Thomas Wharton, Baron Wharton, and Richard Lumley, 1st Earl of Scarbrough. Several foreign restaurants had become established on Gerrard Street by the end of the 19th century, including the Hotel des Etrangers and the Mont Blanc. Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club opened at 39 Gerrard Street in 1959 and remained there until its move to No 47 Frith Street in 1965. Scott kept 39 Gerrard Street open for up-and-coming British jazz musicians (referred to as &#x27;the Old Place&#x27;) until the lease ran out in 1967. The 43 Club was based on Gerrard Street. It was one of the most notorious clubs in Soho, run as a cover for organised crime and illegal after-hours selling of alcohol; following a police investigation, the owner Kate Meyrick was jailed in 1928. During the 1950s, the cheap rents on Gerrard Street attracted Chinese Londoners, many who moved from Poplar. By 1970, the street had become the centre of London&#x27;s Chinatown, and it became pedestrianised and decorated with a Chinese gateway and lanterns. It continues to host numerous Chinese restaurants and shops into the 21st century.

Golden Square is a garden square to the southwest of Soho. Built over land formerly used for grazing, its name is a corruption of gelding. Building began in 1675 and it was complete by the early 18th century. It was originally home to several upper-class residents, including Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland, James Brydges (later to become 1st Duke of Chandos), and Henry St John, 1st Viscount St John. By the mid-18th century the aristocracy had moved west towards Mayfair, and a number of foreign embassies were established around the square. In the 19th century, it became a popular residence for local musicians and instrument makers, while by the 20th it had become an established centre of woollen merchants. A statue of King George II sits in the centre of the square, designed by John Van Nost and constructed in 1753.

Great Marlborough Street was first laid out in the early 18th century, and named after the military commander John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. The street was initially fashionable and was home to numerous peers. The London College of Music was based at No. 47 from 1896 to 1990, while the department store Liberty is on the corner with Regent Street. The street was the location of Philip Morris&#x27;s original London factory and gave its name to the Marlboro brand of cigarettes. Marlborough Street Magistrates Court was based at No. 20–21 and had become one of the country&#x27;s most important magistrates courts by the late 19th century. The Marquess of Queensbury&#x27;s libel trial against Oscar Wilde took place here in 1895. The Rolling Stones&#x27; Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were tried for drugs possession at the court in 1967, with fellow band member Brian Jones being similarly charged a year later.

Great Windmill Street was named after a 17th-century windmill on this location. The Scottish anatomist William Hunter opened his anatomical theatre at No. 16 in 1766, running it until his death in 1783. It continued to be used for anatomical lectures until 1831. The principles of The Communist Manifesto were laid out by Karl Marx in 1850 at a meeting in the Red Lion pub.
Old Compton Street is named after the Bishop of London Henry Compton, and was first laid out in the 1670s, fully developed by 1683. During the late 18th and 19th centuries, it became a popular meeting place for French exiles. The street was the birthplace of Europe&#x27;s rock club circuit (2i&#x27;s club) and contained the first adult cinema in England (The Compton Cinema Club). Dougie Millings, who was the famous tailor for The Beatles, had his first shop at 63 Old Compton Street, which opened in 1962. Old Compton Street is now the core of London&#x27;s main gay village, where there are several businesses catering for the gay community.

Poland Street was named for the King of Poland pub which stood at one end. It was destroyed by a bomb in 1940. Henry Howard, 6th Earl of Suffolk lived at No. 15 in 1717, while Percy Bysshe Shelley briefly lodged in the street in 1811. William Blake lived at No. 28 from 1785 to 1791, and wrote several works there, including &quot;Songs of Innocence&quot; and &quot;The Book of Thel&quot;. The street was the site of the St James Workhouse whose infirmary is believed to be the predecessor to the St. James Infirmary. The first multi-storey car park in London opened on Poland Street in 1934.

Wardour Street dates back to 1585, when it was known as Commonhedge Lane and connected Oxford Street to the King&#x27;s Mews (now part of Trafalgar Square). It began to be built up in the 1680s and was named after local landowner Edward Wardour. Most of the original houses were rebuilt in the 18th century, and the street became known for antiques and furniture dealers. Several music publishers were established along Wardour Street in the early 20th century, including Novello and Co at Nos. 152–160. The most famous location of the Marquee Club was at No. 90 Wardour Street between 1964 and 1988. Another seventies rock hangout was The Intrepid Fox pub (at 97/99 Wardour Street), originally dedicated to Charles James Fox (who is featured on a relief on the outside of the building). It subsequently became a haven for the Goth subculture before closing in 2006.

<text>In the United Kingdom and the British Overseas Territories, personal bravery, achievement, or service are rewarded with honours. The honours system consists of three types of award:

*Honours are used to recognise merit in terms of achievement and service;
*Decorations tend to be used to recognise specific deeds;
*Medals are used to recognise service on a particular operation or in a specific theatre, long or valuable service, and good conduct.

Appointments to the various orders and awards of other honours are usually published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;.

== Brief history ==
Although the Anglo-Saxon monarchs are known to have rewarded their loyal subjects with rings and other symbols of favour, it was the Normans who introduced knighthoods as part of their feudal government. The first English order of chivalry, the Order of the Garter, was created in 1348 by Edward III. Since then, the system has evolved to address the changing need to recognise other forms of service to the United Kingdom.

== System ==
As the head of state, the Sovereign is the fount of honour, but the system for identifying and recognising candidates to honour has changed considerably over time. Various orders of knighthood have been created (see below) as well as awards for military service, bravery, merit, and achievement which take the form of decorations or medals. Most medals are not graded. Each one recognises specific service so there are normally set criteria which must be met. These criteria may include a period of time and will often delimit a particular geographic region. Medals are not normally presented by the Sovereign. A full list is printed in the &quot;order of wear&quot;, published (infrequently) by the &quot;London Gazette&quot;.

=== Orders of honours ===
Honours are split into classes (&quot;orders&quot;) and are graded to distinguish different degrees of achievement or service, according to various criteria. Nominations are reviewed by honours committees made up of government officials and private citizens from different fields, who meet twice a year to discuss the candidates and make recommendations for appropriate honours to be awarded by the King.

=== Selection and nomination ===

==== New Year and Birthday honours ====
A list of approximately 1,350 names are published twice a year, at the New Year and on the date of the Sovereign&#x27;s (official) birthday. Since decisions are inevitably subjective, the twice-yearly honours lists often provoke criticism from those who feel strongly about particular cases. Candidates are identified by public or private bodies, by government departments, or are nominated by members of the public. Depending on their roles, those people selected by the honours committee are submitted either to the Prime Minister, Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, or Secretary of State for Defence for their approval before being sent to the Sovereign for final approval. Certain honours are conferred solely at the Sovereign&#x27;s discretion, such as appointments to the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, the Royal Victorian Order, and the Order of Merit. The honours&#x27; insignia are then presented by the Sovereign or his representative at investitures held at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle or the Palace of Holyroodhouse; Prince Charles, Prince William and Princess Anne deputised for Queen Elizabeth II with William and Anne continuing to do so for King Charles III since his September 2022 accession.

==== Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours ====
By convention, a departing prime minister is allowed to nominate Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours, to reward political and personal service. In recent history, only Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Rishi Sunak have not taken up this privilege (although Brown did issue the 2010 Dissolution Honours and Sunak issued the 2024 Dissolution Honours to similar effect).

==== Special Honours ====
As part of the British honours system, Special Honours are issued at the Monarch&#x27;s pleasure at any given time. The Special Honours refer to the awards made within royal prerogative, operational honours, political honours and other honours awarded outside the New Years Honours and Birthday Honours.

==== Crown Honours Lists ====
== Orders of chivalry ==
=== Current orders ===
The current system is made up of six orders of chivalry and four orders of merit. The statutes of each order specify matters such as the size of the order, the use of post-nominal letters and insignia design and display. These are ordered by the order of wear.

=== Dormant orders ===
Orders were created for particular reasons at particular times. In some cases these reasons have ceased to have any validity and orders have fallen into abeyance, primarily due to the decline of the British Empire during the twentieth century. Reforms of the system have sometimes made other changes. For example, the British Empire Medal temporarily ceased to be awarded in the UK in 1993, as was the companion level award of the Imperial Service Order (although its medal is still used). The British Empire Medal was revived, however, in 2012 with 293 BEMs awarded for the 2012 Birthday Honours, and has continued to be awarded in some other Commonwealth nations.
The Order of St Patrick was founded in 1783 by George III for the Kingdom of Ireland, and after the Acts of Union 1800 continued for Irish peers in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. After the Irish Free State&#x27;s secession in 1922, only members of the royal family were appointed to the order, the last in 1936. The last surviving knight was Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, who died on 10 June 1974. Although dormant, the order technically still exists, and may be used as an award at any time.

Orders relating to the British Raj or the British Indian Empire are also dormant. The senior order, the Order of the Star of India, was divided into three grades, Knight Grand Commander, Knight Commander and Companion, of which the first and highest was conferred upon the Princes and Chiefs of Indian states and upon important British civil servants working in India. Women were not eligible to receive the award. The junior order, the Order of the Indian Empire, was divided into the same ranks and also excluded women. The third order, the Order of the Crown of India, was used exclusively to honour women. Its members, all sharing a single grade, consisted of the wives and close female relatives of Indian Princes or Chiefs; the Viceroy or Governor-General; the Governors of Bombay, Madras and Bengal; the Principal Secretary of State for India; and the Commander-in-Chief in India. Upon Indian independence in 1947, appointments to all these orders ceased.

 Maharaja Tej Singh Prabhakar Bahadur of Alwar, who was a KCSI and the last surviving member of the Order of the Star of India, died in February 2009, aged 97. The last surviving member of the Order of the Indian Empire, HH Maharaja Meghrajji III of Dhrangadhra-Halvad, a KCIE died in August 2010, aged 87. Queen Elizabeth II was appointed to the Order of the Crown of India (then as Princess Elizabeth) and was the last surviving former member of that order until her death in September 2022, aged 96.

The Order of Burma was created in May 1940 by King George VI of the United Kingdom to recognise subjects of the British colony of Burma (Myanmar) after it became a distinct colony, separate from British India. This order had one class which entitled the member to the postnominal letters OB but no title. It was originally intended to reward long and faithful service by military and police. In 1945 the Royal Warrant was altered to allow for membership for acts of gallantry as well as meritorious service. The Order was one of the rarest awarded with only 33 appointments by the time appointments were discontinued in 1948 when Burma declared independence.

=== Orders no longer associated with the British monarch ===
The Royal Guelphic Order, also known as the Hanoverian Guelphic Order, was an honour founded by George, Prince Regent in the name of his father King George III in 1815. In the United Kingdom, it was used only briefly, until the death of William IV in 1837. That is when the personal union with the Kingdom of Hanover ended due to the Hanover throne succession, which followed Salic Law, unlike the United Kingdom, where women could inherit the throne. The order continued for some time as a national order of Hanover, until the Kingdom of Hanover’s defeat against Prussia and forced dissolution in 1866. Since then, it has been a house order to be awarded by the House of Hanover. The order&#x27;s current head is Ernst August Prinz von Hanover, head of the House of Hanover. The Order includes two Divisions, Civil and Military. During the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover, it originally had three classes. Today, after several reorganizations since 1841, it is a house order with four classes and an additional Cross of Merit.

== Decorations ==

=== Current decorations ===
Current awarded decorations in order of wear:

On 1 July 2009, BBC News reported that the Queen had approved a new posthumous award, the Elizabeth Cross, honouring members of the armed forces killed in action or by terrorist attack since World War II. The cross itself is given to the deceased&#x27;s family.

=== Inactive decorations ===
These decorations have not been awarded since the Independence of India in 1947.
== Other honours and appointments ==
=== Hereditary peerage ===
There are five ranks of hereditary peerage: duke, marquess, earl, viscount, and baron. Until the mid-20th century, peerages were usually hereditary. Until the end of the 20th century, English, Scottish, British, and UK peerages (except, until very recent times, those for the time being held by women) carried the right to a seat in the House of Lords.

Hereditary peerages are now normally given only to Royal Family members. The most recent were the grants to: Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s youngest son, Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, on his marriage in 1999; the Queen&#x27;s grandson Prince William, made the Duke of Cambridge on the morning before his marriage to Catherine Middleton on 29 April 2011; and the Queen&#x27;s grandson Prince Harry, made the Duke of Sussex on the morning before his marriage to Meghan Markle on 19 May 2018. No hereditary peerages were granted to commoners after the Labour Party came to power in 1964, until Margaret Thatcher tentatively reintroduced them by two grants to men with no sons in 1983: Speaker of the House of Commons George Thomas and former deputy prime minister William Whitelaw. Both titles died with their holders. She followed this with an earldom in 1984 for former prime minister Harold Macmillan not long before his death, reviving a traditional honour for former prime ministers. Macmillan&#x27;s grandson succeeded him on his death in 1986. No hereditary peerages have been created since, and Thatcher&#x27;s own title was a life peerage (see further explanation below). The concession of a baronetcy (i.e., hereditary knighthood), was granted to her husband Denis following her resignation (explained below).

Hereditary peerages are not &quot;honours under the crown&quot; and cannot normally be withdrawn. A peerage can be revoked only by a specific Act of Parliament, and then only for the current holder, in the case of hereditary peerages. A hereditary peer can disclaim his peerage for his own lifetime under Peerage Act 1963 within a year of inheriting the title.

=== Life peerage ===
Modern life peerages were introduced under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876, following a test case, the &quot;Wensleydale Peerage Case&quot; (1856), which established that non-statutory life peers would not have the right to sit in the House of Lords. At that time, life peerages were intended only for law lords, who would introduce appellate legal expertise into the chamber without conferring rights on future generations, which might not have legal experts.

Subsequently, under the Life Peerages Act 1958, life peerages became the norm for all new grants outside the Royal Family. This was viewed as a modest reform of the second legislative chamber. However, its effects were gradual because hereditary peers and their successors retained their rights to attend and vote with the life peers. All hereditary peers, except 92 chosen in a secret ballot of all hereditary peers, have now lost their rights to sit in the second chamber. All hereditary peers, however, retain dining rights to the House of Lords, viewed as &quot;the best club in London&quot;.

All life peers hold the rank of baron and automatically have the right to sit in the House of Lords. The title exists only for the duration of their own lifetime and is not passed to their heirs, although the children of life peers enjoy the same courtesy titles as those of hereditary peers. Some life peerages are created as an honour for achievement, some for the specific purpose of introducing legislators from the various political parties (known as working peers), and some under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876, with a view to judicial work. There is a discrete number appointed as &quot;People&#x27;s Peers&quot;, recommended by the general public. Twenty-six Church of England bishops have a seat in the House of Lords.

As a life peerage is not technically an &quot;honour under the Crown&quot;, it cannot normally be withdrawn once granted. Thus, while knighthoods have been withdrawn as &quot;honours under the Crown&quot;, convicted criminals who have served their sentences have returned to the House of Lords. In the case of Lord Archer of Weston-super-Mare, he has chosen only to exercise dining rights and has not spoken in Parliament since released from his perjury conviction.

=== Baronetcy ===
A baronetcy is the lowest hereditary title in the United Kingdom. It carries the title sir. In order of precedence, a Baronetcy is below a Barony but above most knighthoods. Baronetcies are not peerages. When a baronetcy becomes vacant on the holder&#x27;s death, the heir is required to register the proofs of succession if he wishes to be addressed as &quot;Sir&quot;. The Official Roll of Baronets is kept at the Ministry of Justice, transferred from the Home Office in 2001, by the Registrar of the Baronetage. Anyone who considers that he is entitled to be entered on the roll may petition the Crown through the Lord Chancellor. Anyone succeeding to a baronetcy must exhibit proofs of succession to the Lord Chancellor. A person who is not entered on the roll will not be addressed or mentioned as a baronet or accorded precedence as a baronet, effectively declining the honour. The baronetcy can be revived at any time on provision of acceptable proofs of succession. As of 2017, 208 baronetcies are listed as presumedly not extinct but awaiting proofs of succession.

As with hereditary peerages, baronetcies generally ceased to be granted after the Labour Party came to power in 1964. The sole subsequent exception was a baronetcy created in 1990 for the husband of Margaret Thatcher, Sir Denis Thatcher, later inherited by their son Mark Thatcher.

=== Knighthood ===

Descended from medieval chivalry, knights exist both within the orders of chivalry and in a class known as &quot;Knights Bachelor&quot;. Regular recipients include High Court judges and, to a lesser extent, Chief Constables of larger police forces. Knighthood carries the title &quot;Sir&quot;; the female equivalent &quot;Dame&quot; exists only within the orders of chivalry—Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) is usually awarded as an equivalent of a Knight Bachelor.

=== Order of St John ===

Members of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem (founded 1888) may wear the Order&#x27;s insignia, but the ranks within the Order of St John do not confer official rank in the order of precedence. Likewise, the abbreviations or post-nominal initials associated with the various grades of membership in the Order of St John do not indicate precedence among the other orders. Thus, someone knighted in the order does not take precedence over the knights of other British orders, nor should they be addressed as &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Dame&quot;.

=== Other orders ===

Other British and Commonwealth orders, decorations, and medals exist that do not carry titles but entitle the holder to place post-nominal letters after his or her name, as do a small number of Royal Family Orders.

== British honours in the Commonwealth realms ==
Until the mid-20th century, the British honours system was the primary—and generally the sole—honours system utilised across the various dominions and territories of the British Empire, which became the Commonwealth of Nations from 1949. Today, British honours and decorations continue to be awarded to citizens of Commonwealth realms and British Overseas Territories. Within the Commonwealth realms, however, the nature of the British honour or decoration awarded and the permissibility of its conferment varies from government to government. The British honours system comprises both dynastic honours, the personal gift of the Sovereign, and British state honours or decorations (known as imperial honours or decorations outside the UK), which are not. Dynastic honours continue to be conferred by the Sovereign across the Commonwealth realms, although outside the United Kingdom they are typically non-titular honours, such as the Order of Merit or the lower grades of the Royal Victorian Order.

In 1917 and 1919, the Canadian House of Commons passed the Nickle Resolutions, which although non-binding gradually ended the conferment of titular honours—peerages, baronetcies, and knighthoods—to Canadians. Occasional conferments of knighthoods (in 1934 and 1935) and imperial honours, notably after the Second World War, continued until 1955, when the Canadian government officially ended all awards of imperial honours to Canadians. In 1967, Canada established its own honours system with the Order of Canada, created its own system of bravery decorations in 1972, and its own system of military decorations for valour in 1993. Canadian service personnel remained eligible to receive the imperial Victoria Cross until 1993, when a Canadian version was instituted. Canadian citizens remain eligible for imperial honours, including peerages and knighthoods, presumably for achievements within Great Britain, however such conferment may involve individual approval by the Canadian government.

In 1975, the Australian government established its own honours system, creating the Order of Australia and its own system of bravery decorations. Indigenous police and fire service decorations followed from 1986, with a new system of military decorations created in 1991. Imperial honours continued to be conferred on Australians through 1989, when the last recommendations were made. With effect from 5 October 1992, the Australian government discontinued the awarding of imperial honours.

In 1975, New Zealand also instituted its first indigenous honour, the Queen&#x27;s Service Order, followed by the Order of New Zealand in 1987. In 1996, it replaced imperial honours with the New Zealand Order of Merit, and replaced imperial gallantry and bravery decorations with New Zealand decorations in 1999.

Other Commonwealth realms have continued to apply the imperial honours system together with their own honours systems. Jamaica established its own honours system in 1969, passing the &quot;National Honours and Awards Act.&quot; Saint Lucia followed in 1980; the Solomon Islands in 1981; Belize in 1991; Antigua and Barbuda in 1998; Papua New Guinea in 2004; and Grenada in 2007. The government of the Bahamas continues to solely use imperial honours. In 2007, it passed a National Honours Act establishing a Bahamian honours system; however, it had not come into effect as of 2015.

In practice, legislation across the Commonwealth realms regulating the awarding of imperial honours to citizens of a realm, including knighthoods and damehoods, does not necessarily prevent a citizen of a Commonwealth realm from receiving a substantive award of an imperial honour for service in the United Kingdom or to its government. There continue to be numerous examples of Canadians, New Zealanders, and Australians who the British government have honored and can use the honour or its accompanying style when they are resident in their own nation or the United Kingdom.

== Honorary awards ==
Citizens of countries that do not have the King as their head of state sometimes have honours conferred upon them, in which case the awards are &quot;honorary&quot;. In the case of knighthoods, the holders are entitled to place initials after their name but not style themselves &quot;Sir&quot; as they are not entitled to receive the accolade. Examples of foreigners with honorary knighthoods are Billy Graham, Bill Gates, Bob Geldof, Bono and Rudolph Giuliani, while Arsène Wenger and Gérard Houllier are honorary OBEs. Honorary knighthoods are of Orders of Chivalry rather than as Knights Bachelor as the latter confers no postnominal letters.

Recipients of honorary awards who later become subjects of His Majesty may apply to convert their awards to substantive ones. Examples of this are Marjorie Scardino, American CEO of Pearson PLC, and Yehudi Menuhin, the American-born violinist and conductor. They were granted an honorary damehood and knighthood respectively while still American citizens, and converted them to substantive awards after they assumed British nationality, becoming Dame Marjorie and Sir Yehudi. Menuhin later accepted a life peerage with the title Lord Menuhin.

Sir Tony O&#x27;Reilly, who holds both British and Irish nationality, uses the style &quot;Sir&quot;, but has also gained approval from the Irish Government to accept the award as is necessary under the Irish Constitution. Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, the German soprano, became entitled to be known as &quot;Dame Elisabeth&quot; when she took British nationality. Irish-born Sir Terry Wogan was initially awarded an honorary knighthood, but by the time he collected the accolade from the Queen in December 2005, he had obtained dual nationality and the award was upgraded to a substantive knighthood.

Bob Geldof is often erroneously referred to as &quot;Sir Bob&quot;; he is not entitled to this style as an honorary knight, as he is a citizen of the Republic of Ireland (i.e., he is not a citizen of a Commonwealth realm).

There is no law in the UK preventing foreigners from holding a peerage (e.g., Newburgh), though only Commonwealth and Irish citizens may sit in the House of Lords. This has yet to be tested under the new arrangements. However, some other countries have laws restricting the acceptances of awards granted to would-be recipients by foreign powers. In Canada, where the House of Commons of Canada (but not the Senate of Canada) has opposed the granting of titular honours with its (non-binding) Nickle Resolution, then Prime Minister Jean Chrétien advised the Queen not to grant Conrad Black a titular honour while he remained a Canadian citizen (see Black v Chrétien).

== Ceremony ==
Each year, around 2,600 people receive their awards personally from the monarch or another member of the Royal Family. The majority of investitures take place at Buckingham Palace, but an annual ceremony also takes place at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh (during Holyrood Week), and some happen at Windsor Castle. There are approximately 120 recipients at each Investiture. In recent years the King, the Prince of Wales and The Princess Royal have all held investitures.

During the ceremony, the monarch enters the ballroom of Buckingham Palace attended by two Gurkha orderly officers, a tradition begun in 1876 by Queen Victoria. On duty on the dais are five members of the King&#x27;s Body Guard of the Yeomen of the Guard, which was created in 1485 by Henry VII; they are the oldest, but not most senior, military corps in the United Kingdom. Three Lady or Gentleman Ushers are on duty to help look after the recipients and their guests.

The King or his representative is escorted by either the Lord Chamberlain or the Lord Steward. After the national anthem has been played, he stands to the right of the King and announces the name of each recipient and the achievement for which they are being decorated. The King or his representative is provided with a brief background for each recipient by their equerry as they approach to receive their decorations.

Men who are to be knighted kneel on an investiture stool to receive the accolade, which the King bestows. Elizabeth II used the sword used by her father, George VI as Duke of York and Colonel of the Scots Guards. Only men are knighted. Women receive their honours in the same fashion as men receiving decorations or medals, even if they are receiving a damehood. Occasionally an award for gallantry may be made posthumously and in this case, the King or his representative presents the decoration or medal to the recipient&#x27;s next-of-kin in private before the public investiture begins. The Elizabeth Cross was created especially for this purpose.

After the investiture ceremony, those honoured are ushered out of the ballroom into the Inner Quadrangle of Buckingham Palace, where the royal rota&#x27;s photographers are stationed. Here recipients are photographed with their awards. In some cases, members of the press may interview some of the more well-known people who have been honoured.

== Refusal ==

In 2003, &quot;Sunday Times&quot; published a list of almost 300 people who had declined an honour between 1951 and 1999. In 2020, &quot;the Guardian&quot; reported based on a Freedom of Information request, that the number of people refusing an honour had more than doubled in the previous nine years.

== Revocation ==

Honours are sometimes revoked (forfeited), for example if a recipient is subsequently convicted of a serious criminal offence. The Honours Forfeiture Committee is an &quot;ad hoc&quot; committee convened under the chairmanship of the Head of the Home Civil Service, to consider cases where information has been received which indicates an individual is unsuitable to hold an award. Sometimes the original decision to grant an honour was made on the basis of inaccurate information (including through manipulation of the public nominations system), but normally cases relate to actions that took place after the award was made. Recommendations are made to the monarch of the United Kingdom, who has the sole authority to rescind an honour.

In 2009, Gordon Brown confirmed that the process remains as set out in 1994 by the then Prime Minister John Major in a written answer to the House of Commons:

In October 2016, the House of Commons approved a motion to ask the Honours Forfeiture Committee to strip Sir Philip Green of his knighthood for his role in the downfall of British Home Stores. It was the first time MPs voted to recommend rescinding a knighthood.

=== Notable examples ===
*Kaiser Wilhelm II was a Knight Companion of the Garter prior to the start of the First World War, when it was revoked.
*Roger Casement had been honoured for his human rights work while a British diplomat; however, upon being convicted on 30 June 1916 of High Treason for his role in the Irish 1916 Easter Rising, the King directed that Casement would cease to be a member of the Order of St Michael and St George, his name being stricken from the register, and letters patent were also issued &quot;degrading&quot; him &quot;from the degree, title and dignity of Knight Bachelor&quot;. He was executed that August.
*Benito Mussolini was stripped of his honorary knighthood after Italy declared war on the United Kingdom in 1940.
*Anthony Blunt, knighted as Surveyor of the Queen&#x27;s Pictures for his services to Art, lost his knighthood in the 1980s when he was revealed to be the &quot;Fourth Man&quot; in the early 1950s Burgess and Maclean spying scandal which also touched on the 1960s Philby spying affair, as a result of which he confessed to the security services. Although Blunt was never charged or convicted, the honour was withdrawn on the advice of the then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.
*Nicolae Ceaușescu forfeited his honorary knighthood that he earlier received for his friendship with Western democracies.
*Albert Henry was the former Premier of the Cook Islands. He was later convicted of electoral fraud in the 1980s.
*Terry Lewis, knighted for his services to Queensland police, was stripped of his knighthood in 1993 after being sentenced to prison on charges of corruption and forgery as a result of the findings of the Fitzgerald Inquiry.
*Jack Lyons, who had received his knighthood for his huge charitable donations and services to industry, lost it when he was convicted of fraud in the 1980s.
*Robert Mugabe was stripped of his honorary GCB after calls from the Government to the Royal Family due to the crisis in Zimbabwe under his régime, including hyperinflation, and violence in the 2008 presidential elections.
*Lester Piggott, the high-profile jockey, had his OBE removed after being convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for tax evasion.
*Fred Goodwin, the former CEO of Royal Bank of Scotland, had his knighthood annulled, after the Financial Services Authority found that the failure of RBS had an important role in the financial crisis of 2008–9, because Goodwin was the dominant decision maker at the time.
*James Crosby, former CEO of HBOS and non-executive director of the Financial Services Authority, was stripped of his knighthood at his request in April 2013 as the result of the bank&#x27;s collapse during the UK financial crisis.

== Order of Wear ==

Honours, decorations and medals are arranged in the &quot;Order of Wear&quot;, an official list which describes the order in which they should be worn. Updates to the Order of Wear are published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; when necessary. The current Order of Wear was published on 11 January 2019. Additional information on the social events at which an award may be worn is contained in the insignia case given to each recipient.

The list places the Victoria Cross and George Cross at the top, followed by the orders of knighthood arranged in order of date of creation. Below the Knights of the Garter and Thistle, individuals of a higher rank precede those of a lower rank. For instance, a Knight Grand Cross of any order precedes any Knight Commander. For those of equal rank, members of the higher-ranked Order take precedence. Within the same Order, precedence is accorded to that individual who received the honour earlier.

Not all orders have the same number of ranks. The Order of Merit, the Order of the Companions of Honour, the Distinguished Service Order and the Imperial Service Order are slightly different, being single-rank honours, and have been placed at appropriate positions of seniority. The precedence of Knight Bachelor is below the knights of the different orders and above those with the rank of Commander or lower.

Decorations are followed by medals of various categories, being arranged in date order within each section. These are followed by Commonwealth and honorary foreign awards of any level. Miscellaneous details are explained in notes at the bottom of the list.

The order of wear is not connected to and should not be confused with the order of precedence.

== Style ==
For peers, see forms of address in the United Kingdom.

For baronets, the style &quot;Sir John Smith, Bt&quot; (or &quot;Bart&quot;) is used. Their wives are styled &quot;Lady Smith&quot;. A baronetess is styled &quot;Dame Jane Smith, Btss&quot;.

For knights, the style &quot;Sir John Smith postnominals]&quot; is used, attaching the proper postnominal letters depending on rank and order (for knights bachelor, no postnominal letters are used). Their wives are styled &quot;Lady Smith&quot;, with no postnominal letters. A dame is styled &quot;Dame Jane Smith, [postnominals]&quot;. More familiar references or oral addresses use the first name only, e.g. &quot;Sir John&quot;, or &quot;Dame Joan&quot;.

Wives of knights and baronets are styled &quot;Lady Smith&quot;, although customarily no courtesy title is automatically reciprocated to male consorts.

Recipients of orders, decorations and medals receive no styling of &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Dame&quot;, but they may attach the according postnominal letters to their name, e.g., &quot;John Smith, VC&quot;. Recipients of gallantry awards may be referred to in Parliament as &quot;gallant&quot;, in addition to &quot;honourable&quot;, &quot;noble&quot;, etc.: &quot;The honourable and gallant Gentleman&quot;.

Bailiffs or Dames Grand Cross (GCStJ), Knights/Dames of Justice/Grace (KStJ/DStJ), Commander Brothers/Sisters (CStJ), Officer Brothers/Sisters (OStJ), Serving Brothers/Sisters (SBStJ/SSStJ), and Esquires (EsqStJ) of the Order of St John do not receive any special styling with regards to prenominal address i.e. Sir or Dame. They may, however, attach the relevant postnominal initials (solely) within internal correspondence of the Order. In the Priory of Australia, Canada and the United States, the rank of Serving Brother/Sister is no longer granted. The rank now awarded is referred to as Member of the Order of St John for both men and women.

For honours bestowed upon those in the entertainment industry (e.g., Anthony Hopkins, Maggie Smith), it is an accepted practice to omit the title for professional credits.

== Reform ==

Reforms of the system occur from time to time. In the last century notable changes to the system have included a Royal Commission in 1925 following the scandal in which Prime Minister David Lloyd George was found to be selling honours. The sale of British Honours, including titles, is now prohibited by the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925. 

A significant set of reforms were enacted in 1993 under the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, with the intention of providing a more merits-based system for honouring service and achievement. Among other outcomes, this removed the rank distinctions that were explicitly linked to certain military awards, and ended (with the exception of High Court Judges) the awarding of &quot;ex officio&quot; honours. The reforms also provided for people to be nominated for an honour by members of the public, as well as placing more emphasis within the system on recognising and rewarding voluntary service in particular.

In July 2004, the Public Administration Select Committee (PASC) of the House of Commons and, concurrently, Sir Hayden Phillips, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Constitutional Affairs, both concluded reviews of the system. The PASC recommended some radical changes; Sir Hayden concentrated on issues of procedure and transparency. In February 2005, the Government responded to both reviews by issuing a Command paper detailing which of the proposed changes it had accepted. These included diversifying and opening up the system of honours selection committees for the Prime Minister&#x27;s list and also the introduction of a miniature badge. Furthermore, the 2004 review suggested a regular report on the transparency and operation of the system at a suggested frequency of every 3 years. These reviews have taken place in 2008, 2011, 2014, 2018 and 2023. The most recent review covers the period 2019 to 2023 and shows a notable shift towards community and voluntary recognition, and a continued emphasis on ensuring that the Honours System reflects British societal diversity.

As of 2012, same-sex civil partners of individual recipients of British honours are not themselves granted honours by way of their partnered relation. In July 2012, Conservative MP Oliver Colvile introduced a private member&#x27;s bill, titled &quot;Honours (Equality of Titles for Partners) Bill&quot;, to amend the honours system to both allow husbands of those made dames and for civil partners of recipients to receive honours by their relationship statuses.

In May 2020, a special COVID nomination process was introduced to provide a more streamlined consideration process and accessible route for the public to nominate those in society who had responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with the existing public nomination form, it required substantially less information in order to be accepted and processed. This process was ended in May 2022.

== Controversies ==
A scandal in the 1920s was the sale by Maundy Gregory of honours and peerages to raise political funds for David Lloyd George.

In 1976, the Harold Wilson era was mired by controversy over the 1976 Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours, which became known as the &quot;Lavender List&quot;.

In 2006, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; newspaper revealed that every donor who had given £1,000,000 or more to the Labour Party since 1997 was given a Knighthood or a Peerage (see Cash-for-Honours scandal). Moreover, the government had given honours to 12 of the 14 individuals who have donated more than £200,000 to Labour and of the 22 who donated more than £100,000, 17 received honours. An investigation by the Crown Prosecution Service did not lead to any charges being made.

&quot;The Times&quot; published an analysis of the recipients of honours in December 2015 which showed that 46% of those getting knighthoods and above in 2015 had been to fee-paying public schools. In 1955 it was 50%. Only 6.55% of the population attends such schools. 27% had been to Oxford or Cambridge universities (18% in 1955).

<text>Electroporation, or electropermeabilization, is a technique in which an electrical field is applied to cells in order to increase the permeability of the cell membrane. This may allow chemicals, drugs, electrode arrays or DNA to be introduced into the cell (also called electrotransfer).

In microbiology, the process of electroporation is often used to transform bacteria, yeast, or plant protoplasts by introducing new coding DNA. If bacteria and plasmids are mixed together, the plasmids can be transferred into the bacteria after electroporation, though depending on what is being transferred, cell-penetrating peptides or cell squeeze could also be used. Electroporation works by passing thousands of volts (~8 kV/cm) across suspended cells in an electroporation cuvette. Afterwards, the cells have to be handled carefully until they have had a chance to divide, producing new cells that contain reproduced plasmids. This process is approximately ten times more effective in increasing cell membrane&#x27;s permeability than chemical transformation, although many laboratories lack the specialized equipment needed for electroporation.

Electroporation is also highly efficient for the introduction of foreign genes into tissue culture cells, especially mammalian cells. For example, it is used in the process of producing knockout mice, as well as in tumor treatment, gene therapy, and cell-based therapy. The process of introducing foreign DNA into eukaryotic cells is known as transfection. Electroporation is highly effective for transfecting cells in suspension using electroporation cuvettes. Electroporation has proven efficient for use on tissues &quot;in vivo&quot;, for &quot;in utero&quot; applications as well as &quot;in ovo&quot; transfection. Adherent cells can also be transfected using electroporation, providing researchers with an alternative to trypsinizing their cells prior to transfection. One downside to electroporation, however, is that after the process the gene expression of over 7,000 genes can be affected. This can cause problems in studies where gene expression has to be controlled to ensure accurate and precise results.

Although bulk electroporation has many benefits over physical delivery methods such as microinjections and gene guns, it still has limitations, including low cell viability. Miniaturization of electroporation has been studied, leading to microelectroporation and nanotransfection of tissue utilizing electroporation-based techniques via nanochannels to minimally invasively deliver cargo to the cells.

Electroporation has also been used as a mechanism to trigger cell fusion. Artificially induced cell fusion can be used to investigate and treat different diseases, like diabetes, regenerate axons of the central nerve system, and produce cells with desired properties, such as in cell vaccines for cancer immunotherapy. However, the first and most known application of cell fusion is production of monoclonal antibodies in hybridoma technology, where hybrid cell lines (hybridomas) are formed by fusing specific antibody-producing B lymphocytes with a myeloma (B lymphocyte cancer) cell line.

==Laboratory practice==

Electroporation is performed with electroporators, purpose-built appliances that create an electrostatic field in a cell solution. The cell suspension is pipetted into a glass or plastic cuvette which has two aluminium electrodes on its sides. For bacterial electroporation, typically a suspension of around 50 microliters is used. Prior to electroporation, this suspension of bacteria is mixed with the plasmid to be transformed. The mixture is pipetted into the cuvette, the voltage and capacitance are set, and the cuvette is inserted into the electroporator. The process requires direct contact between the electrodes and the suspension. Immediately after electroporation, one milliliter of liquid medium is added to the bacteria (in the cuvette or in an Eppendorf tube), and the tube is incubated at the bacteria&#x27;s optimal temperature for an hour or more to allow recovery of the cells and expression of the plasmid, followed by bacterial culture on agar plates.

The success of the electroporation depends greatly on the purity of the plasmid solution, especially on its salt content. Solutions with high salt concentrations might cause an electrical discharge (known as arcing), which often reduces the viability of the bacteria. For a further detailed investigation of the process, more attention should be paid to the output impedance of the porator device and the input impedance of the cells suspension (e.g. salt content).

Since the cell membrane is not able to pass current (except in ion channels), it acts as an electrical capacitor. Subjecting membranes to a high-voltage electric field results in their temporary breakdown, resulting in pores that are large enough to allow macromolecules (such as DNA) to enter or leave the cell.

Additionally, electroporation can be used to increase permeability of cells during in Utero injections and surgeries. Particularly, the electroporation allows for a more efficient transfection of DNA, RNA, shRNA, and all nucleic acids into the cells of mice and rats. The success of &quot;in vivo&quot; electroporation depends greatly on voltage, repetition, pulses, and duration. Developing central nervous systems are most effective for &quot;in vivo&quot; electroporation due to the visibility of ventricles for injections of nucleic acids, as well as the increased permeability of dividing cells. Electroporation of injected in utero embryos is performed through the uterus wall, often with forceps-type electrodes to limit damage to the embryo.

== &quot;In vitro&quot; and animal studies ==

&quot;In vivo&quot; gene electrotransfer was first described in 1991 and today there are many preclinical studies of gene electrotransfer. The method is used to deliver large variety of therapeutic genes for potential treatment of several diseases, such as: disorders in immune system, tumors, metabolic disorders, monogenetic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, analgesia...

With regards to irreversible electroporation, the first successful treatment of malignant cutaneous tumors implanted in mice was completed in 2007 by a group of scientists who achieved complete tumor ablation in 12 out of 13 mice. They accomplished this by sending 80 pulses of 100 microseconds at 0.3 Hz with an electrical field magnitude of 2500 V/cm to treat the cutaneous tumors. Currently, a number of companies, including AngioDynamics, Inc. and VoltMed, Inc., are continuing to develop and deploy irreversible electroporation-based technologies within clinical environments.

The first group to look at electroporation for medical applications was led by Lluis M Mir at the Institute Gustave Roussy. In this case, they looked at the use of reversible electroporation in conjunction with impermeable macromolecules. The first research looking at how nanosecond pulses might be used on human cells was conducted by researchers at Eastern Virginia Medical School and Old Dominion University, and published in 2003.

==Medical applications==
The first medical application of electroporation was used for introducing poorly permeant anticancer drugs into tumor nodules. Soon also gene electrotransfer became of special interest because of its low cost, easiness of realization and safety. Namely, viral vectors can have serious limitations in terms of immunogenicity and pathogenicity when used for DNA transfer.

Irreversible electroporation is being used and evaluated as cardiac ablation therapy to kill very small areas of heart muscle. This is done to treat irregularities of heart rhythm. A cardiac catheter delivers trains of high-voltage ultra-rapid electrical pulses that form irreversible pores in cell membranes, resulting in cell death. It is thought to allow better selectivity than the previous techniques, which used heat or cold to kill larger volumes of muscle.

A higher voltage of electroporation was found in pigs to irreversibly destroy target cells within a narrow range while leaving neighboring cells unaffected, and thus represents a promising new treatment for cancer, heart disease and other disease states that require removal of tissue. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) has since proven effective in treating human cancer, with surgeons at Johns Hopkins and other institutions now using the technology to treat pancreatic cancer previously thought to be unresectable.

Also first phase I clinical trial of gene electrotransfer in patients with metastatic melanoma was reported. Electroporation mediated delivery of a plasmid coding gene for interleukin-12 (pIL-12) was performed and safety, tolerability and therapeutic effect were monitored. Study concluded, that gene electrotransfer with pIL-12 is safe and well tolerated. In addition partial or complete response was observed also in distant non treated metastases, suggesting the systemic treatment effect. Based on these results they are already planning to move to Phase II clinical study. There are currently several ongoing clinical studies of gene electrotransfer where safety, tolerability and effectiveness of immunization with DNA vaccine, which is administered by the electric pulses is monitored.

Although the method is not systemic, but strictly local one, it is still the most efficient non-viral strategy for gene delivery.

===N-TIRE===
A recent technique called non-thermal irreversible electroporation (N-TIRE) has proven successful in treating many different types of tumors and other unwanted tissue. This procedure is done using small electrodes (about 1mm in diameter), placed either inside or surrounding the target tissue to apply short, repetitive bursts of electricity at a predetermined voltage and frequency. These bursts of electricity increase the resting transmembrane potential (TMP), so that nanopores form in the plasma membrane. When the electricity applied to the tissue is above the electric field threshold of the target tissue, the cells become permanently permeable from the formation of nanopores. As a result, the cells are unable to repair the damage and die due to a loss of homeostasis. N-TIRE is unique to other tumor ablation techniques in that it does not create thermal damage to the tissue around it.

===Reversible electroporation===
Contrastingly, reversible electroporation occurs when the electricity applied with the electrodes is below the electric field threshold of the target tissue. Because the electricity applied is below the cells&#x27; threshold, it allows the cells to repair their phospholipid bilayer and continue on with their normal cell functions. Reversible electroporation is typically done with treatments that involve getting a drug or gene (or other molecule that is not normally permeable to the cell membrane) into the cell. Not all tissue has the same electric field threshold; therefore careful calculations need to be made prior to a treatment to ensure safety and efficacy.

One major advantage of using N-TIRE is that, when done correctly according to careful calculations, it only affects the target tissue. Proteins, the extracellular matrix, and critical structures such as blood vessels and nerves are all unaffected and left healthy by this treatment. This allows for a quicker recovery, and facilitates a more rapid replacement of dead tumor cells with healthy cells.

Before doing the procedure, scientists must carefully calculate exactly what needs to be done and treat each patient on an individual case-by-case basis. To do this, imaging technology such as CT scans and MRI&#x27;s are commonly used to create a 3D image of the tumor. From this information, they can approximate the volume of the tumor and decide on the best course of action including the insertion site of electrodes, the angle they are inserted in, the voltage needed, and more, using software technology. Often, a CT machine will be used to help with the placement of electrodes during the procedure, particularly when the electrodes are being used to treat tumors in the brain.

The entire procedure is very quick, typically taking about five minutes. The success rate of these procedures is high and is very promising for future treatment in humans. One disadvantage to using N-TIRE is that the electricity delivered from the electrodes can stimulate muscle cells to contract, which could have lethal consequences depending on the situation. Therefore, a paralytic agent must be used when performing the procedure. The paralytic agents that have been used in such research are successful; however, there is always some risk, albeit slight, when using anesthetics.

===H-FIRE===
A more recent technique has been developed called high-frequency irreversible electroporation (H-FIRE). This technique uses electrodes to apply bipolar bursts of electricity at a high frequency, as opposed to unipolar bursts of electricity at a low frequency. This type of procedure has the same tumor ablation success as N-TIRE. However, it has one distinct advantage, H-FIRE does not cause muscle contraction in the patient and therefore there is no need for a paralytic agent. Furthermore, H-FIRE has been demonstrated to produce more predictable ablations due to the lesser difference in the electrical properties of tissues at higher frequencies.

=== Drug and gene delivery ===

Electroporation can also be used to help deliver drugs or genes into the cell by applying short and intense electric pulses that transiently permeabilize cell membrane, thus allowing transport of molecules otherwise not transported through a cellular membrane. This procedure is referred to as electrochemotherapy when the molecules to be transported are chemotherapeutic agents or gene electrotransfer when the molecule to be transported is DNA. Scientists from Karolinska Institute and the University of Oxford use electroporation of exosomes to deliver siRNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, chemotherapeutic agents and proteins specifically to neurons after inject them systemically (in blood). Because these exosomes are able to cross the blood brain barrier, this protocol could solve the problem of poor delivery of medications to the central nervous system, and potentially treat Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and brain cancer, among other conditions.

Bacterial transformation is generally the easiest way to make large amounts of a particular protein needed for biotechnology purposes or in medicine. Since gene electrotransfer is very simple, rapid and highly effective technique it first became very convenient replacement for other transformation procedures.

Recent research has shown that shock waves could be used for pre-treating the cell membrane prior to electroporation. This synergistic strategy has shown to reduce external voltage requirement and create larger pores. Also application of shock waves allow scope to target desired membrane site. This procedure allows to control the size of the pore.

==Physical mechanism==
Electroporation allows cellular introduction of large highly charged molecules such as DNA which would never passively diffuse across the hydrophobic bilayer core. This phenomenon indicates that the mechanism is the creation of nm-scale water-filled holes in the membrane. Electropores were optically imaged in lipid bilayer models like droplet interface bilayers and giant unilamellar vesicles, while addition of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin networks to the giant unilamellar vesicles seem to prevent the formation of visible electropores. Experimental evidences for actin networks in regulating the cell membrane permeability has also emerged. Although electroporation and dielectric breakdown both result from application of an electric field, the mechanisms involved are fundamentally different. In dielectric breakdown the barrier material is ionized, creating a conductive pathway. The material alteration is thus chemical in nature. In contrast, during electroporation the lipid molecules are not chemically altered but simply shift position, opening up a pore which acts as the conductive pathway through the bilayer as it is filled with water.

Electroporation is a dynamic phenomenon that depends on the local transmembrane voltage at each point on the cell membrane. It is generally accepted that for a given pulse duration and shape, a specific transmembrane voltage threshold exists for the manifestation of the electroporation phenomenon (from 0.5 V to 1 V). This leads to the definition of an electric field magnitude threshold for electroporation (Eth). That is, only the cells within areas where E≧Eth are electroporated. If a second threshold (Eir) is reached or surpassed, electroporation will compromise the viability of the cells, &quot;i.e.&quot;, irreversible electroporation (IRE).

Electroporation is a multi-step process with several distinct phases. First, a short electrical pulse must be applied. Typical parameters would be 300–400 mV for &lt; 1 ms across the membrane (note- the voltages used in cell experiments are typically much larger because they are being applied across large distances to the bulk solution so the resulting field across the actual membrane is only a small fraction of the applied bias). Upon application of this potential the membrane charges like a capacitor through the migration of ions from the surrounding solution. Once the critical field is achieved there is a rapid localized rearrangement in lipid morphology. The resulting structure is believed to be a &quot;pre-pore&quot; since it is not electrically conductive but leads rapidly to the creation of a conductive pore. Evidence for the existence of such pre-pores comes mostly from the &quot;flickering&quot; of pores, which suggests a transition between conductive and insulating states. It has been suggested that these pre-pores are small (~3 Å) hydrophobic defects. If this theory is correct, then the transition to a conductive state could be explained by a rearrangement at the pore edge, in which the lipid heads fold over to create a hydrophilic interface. Finally, these conductive pores can either heal, resealing the bilayer or expand, eventually rupturing it. The resultant fate depends on whether the critical defect size was exceeded which in turn depends on the applied field, local mechanical stress and bilayer edge energy.

=== Gene electroporation ===

Application of electric pulses of sufficient strength to the cell causes an increase in the trans-membrane potential difference, which provokes the membrane destabilization. Cell membrane permeability is increased and otherwise nonpermeant molecules enter the cell.
Although the mechanisms of gene electrotransfer are not yet fully understood, it was shown that the introduction of DNA only occurs in the part of the membrane facing the cathode and that several steps are needed for successful transfection: electrophoretic migration of DNA towards the cell, DNA insertion into the membrane, translocation across the membrane, migration of DNA towards the nucleus, transfer of DNA across the nuclear envelope and finally gene expression. There are a number of factors that can influence the efficiency of gene electrotransfer, such as: temperature, parameters of electric pulses, DNA concentration, electroporation buffer used, cell size and the ability of cells to express transfected genes. In &quot;in vivo&quot; gene electrotransfer, DNA diffusion through extracellular matrix, properties of tissue and overall tissue conductivity are also crucial.

==History==
In the 1960s it was known that by applying an external electric field, a large membrane potential at the two pole of a cell can be created. In the 1970s it was discovered that when a membrane potential reached a critical level, the membrane would break down and that it could recover. By the 1980s, this opening was being used to introduce various materials/molecules into the cells.

<doc id="39620" wikidata="Q1365298" url="?curid=39620" title="Freddie Prinze">
<text>Frederick Karl Prinze Sr. (born Frederick Karl Pruetzel; June 22, 1954 – January 29, 1977) was an American stand-up comedian and actor, and the star of the NBC-TV sitcom &quot;Chico and the Man&quot; from 1974 until his death in 1977. He was described in a &quot;Vulture&quot; magazine article as &quot;having blown up like no other comedian in history.&quot; Prinze is the father of actor Freddie Prinze Jr.

== Early life ==
Prinze was born Frederick Karl Pruetzel (German spelling: Prützel) at Saint Clare&#x27;s Hospital in Manhattan, New York City, the son of Maria de Gracia Pruetzel (née Graniela y Ramirez) and Edward Karl Pruetzel. His mother was a Puerto Rican Catholic and his father was a German Lutheran immigrant who had arrived in the U.S. as a youth in 1934. Prinze was raised in a mixed neighborhood in Washington Heights, New York City. When Prinze was a small child, his mother enrolled him in ballet classes to deal with a weight problem. Without telling his parents, Prinze successfully auditioned for the High School of Performing Arts, where he was introduced to drama and continued ballet—and where he discovered his gift for comedy while entertaining crowds in the boys&#x27; restroom. He dropped out of school in his senior year to become a stand-up comedian.

== Career ==

Prinze worked at several comedy clubs in New York City, including The Improv and Catch a Rising Star, where he introduced himself to audiences as a &quot;Hunga-rican&quot; (part Hungarian, part Puerto Rican). Although his mother was in fact Puerto Rican, his father was a German immigrant with Hungarian ancestry. Prinze&#x27;s son, Freddie Prinze Jr., has stated many times that his father was half German/half Puerto Rican. This is also verified by census records as well as Prützel/Pruetzel family accounts. For the sake of his budding comedic career, he legally changed his surname to &quot;Prinze&quot;. According to his friend David Brenner, Prinze originally wanted to be known as the king of comedy, but since Alan King already had that last name and sobriquet, he would be the prince of comedy instead. During 1973, Prinze made his first television appearance on one of the last episodes of &quot;Jack Paar Tonite&quot;. In December 1973, his biggest break came with an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. Prinze was the first young comedian to be asked to have a sit-down chat with Carson on his first appearance. Prinze appeared on and guest-hosted &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on several other occasions. He also appeared on&quot; The Midnight Special&quot; to perform his comic routine.

From September 1974 until his death in January 1977, Prinze starred as Francisco &quot;Chico&quot; Rodriguez in the NBC TV series &quot;Chico and the Man&quot; with Jack Albertson. The show was an instant hit. Prinze made several appearances on &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts&quot;, most notably the roasts for Sammy Davis Jr. and Muhammad Ali. In 1975, he released a comedy album that was taped live at Mister Kelly&#x27;s in Chicago entitled &quot;Looking Good&quot;—his catch phrase from &quot;Chico and the Man&quot;. In 1976, he starred in a made-for-TV movie, &quot;The Million Dollar Rip-Off&quot;. Prinze had a little-known talent for singing, examples of which could be heard in the background of the title song of the Tony Orlando and Dawn album &quot;To Be With You&quot;, in his appearances on their variety show, and on rare occasions on his own sitcom. About four months before his death, Prinze signed a five-year deal with NBC worth $6 million.

== Personal life ==

On October 13, 1975, Prinze married Katherine &quot;Kathy&quot; Elaine (Barber) Cochran, with whom he had one child, son Freddie Prinze Jr., who was born March 8, 1976. Prinze was arrested for driving under the influence of Quaalude on November 16, 1976. A few weeks later his wife filed for divorce.

Prinze had been romantically linked to actresses Raquel Welch and Pam Grier, whom he met in 1973. Grier recalls their relationship in chapter nineteen of her memoir, &quot;My Life in Three Acts&quot;. After his break-up with Grier, Prinze dated actress Lonette McKee for a time during 1976. Prinze also dated Joanna Kerns a short time before he died. The two had worked together on the 1976 TV movie, &quot;The Million Dollar Rip-Off&quot;.

Prinze was very close friends with singer Tony Orlando; Orlando appeared on &quot;Chico and the Man&quot;, and Prinze appeared on Orlando&#x27;s variety show. As he started to make more money, Prinze took martial arts lessons from Robert Wall, a student of Bruce Lee, who appeared in &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Way of the Dragon&quot;. Soon after, Wall became godfather to Prinze&#x27;s newborn son.

== Death ==
Prinze suffered from depression. On the night of January 28, 1977, after talking on the telephone with his estranged wife, Prinze received a visit from his business manager, Marvin &quot;Dusty&quot; Snyder. During the visit, Prinze put a gun to his head and shot himself. He had purchased this gun in the presence of fellow actors Jimmie &quot;JJ&quot; Walker and Alan Bursky, although it was long rumored that Bursky gave him the gun. Prinze was rushed to the UCLA Medical Center and placed on life support following emergency surgery. His family removed him from life support, and he died at 1 p.m. on January 29.

Prinze made farewell phone calls to numerous family members and friends prior to shooting himself and left a note stating that he had decided to kill himself. In 1977, the death was ruled a suicide. However, in a 1983 civil case brought by his mother, wife, and son against Crown Life Insurance Company, the jury found that his death was medication-induced and accidental, which enabled the family to collect $200,000 in life insurance. This followed a $1 million out-of-court settlement with his psychiatrist and doctor to end a malpractice suit for allowing him access to a gun and overprescribing him Quaalude (as a tranquilizer).

When &quot;Chico &amp; the Man&quot; went into hiatus due to Prinze&#x27;s death, a new mid-season series, which would go on to become highly successful, &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, gave its star, John Ritter, Prinze&#x27;s dressing room for its pilot episode. 

Prinze is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles, near his father, Edward Karl Pruetzel. His son, Freddie Prinze Jr., who was under one year old when his father died, did not speak publicly about his father&#x27;s death until he discussed it in the documentary &quot;Misery Loves Comedy&quot; (2015), directed by Kevin Pollak.

<text>Shiraz (; ) is the fifth-most-populous city of Iran and the capital of Fars province, which has been historically known as Pars () and Persis. As of the 2016 national census, the population of the city was 1,565,572 people, and its built-up area with Sadra was home to almost 1,800,000 inhabitants. A census in 2021 showed an increase in the city&#x27;s population to 1,995,500 people. Shiraz is located in southwestern Iran on the () seasonal river. Founded in the early Islamic period, the city has a moderate climate and has been a regional trade center for over a thousand years.

The earliest reference to the city, as &quot;Tiraziš&quot;, is on Elamite clay tablets dated to 2000 BCE. The modern city was founded by the Sasanian dynasty and restored by the Umayyad Caliphate in 693 CE and grew prominent under the successive Iranian Saffarid and Buyid dynasties in the 9th and 10th–11th centuries, respectively. In the 13th century, Shiraz became a leading center of the arts and letters, due to the encouragement of its ruler and the presence of many Persian scholars and artists. Two famous poets of Iran, Hafez and Saadi, are from Shiraz, whose tombs are located on the north side of the current city boundaries.

Shiraz is one of the top tourist cities in Iran and is known as the city of poets, literature, and flowers. It is also considered by many Iranians to be the city of gardens due to the presence of many gardens and fruit trees that can be seen throughout the city, such as Eram Garden. Shiraz is also a famous tourist destination in the world. Every year many tourists come from around the world to visit the city. Shiraz has historically had major Jewish and Christian communities. The crafts of Shiraz consist of inlaid mosaic work of triangular design; silverware; pile carpet-weaving and weaving of kilim, called and in the villages and among the tribes. Dominant industries in the city include the production of cement, sugar, fertilizers, textile products, wood products, metalwork, and rugs. Shiraz also has a major oil refinery and is a major centre for Iran&#x27;s electronic industries: 53 percent of Iran&#x27;s electronic investment has been centred in Shiraz. The city is home to Iran&#x27;s first solar powerplant. Recently, Shiraz&#x27;s first wind turbine has been installed above Mount Babakuhi near the city.

==Etymology==

The earliest reference to the city is on Elamite clay tablets dated to 2000 BCE, found in June 1970, while digging to make a kiln for a brick factory in the south western corner of the city. The tablets written in ancient Elamite name a city called Tiraziš. Phonetically, this is interpreted as /tiračis/ or /ćiračis/. This name became Old Persian /širājiš/; through regular sound change comes the modern Persian name &quot;Shirāz&quot;. The name Shiraz also appears on clay sealings found at a 2nd-century CE Sassanid ruin, east of the city. By some of the native writers, the name Shiraz has derived from a son of Tahmuras, the third Shāh (King) of the world according to Ferdowsi&#x27;s Shāhnāma.

==History==
===Pre-Islamic era===
Though, there is no definitive record of its existence prior to the late 7th century CE, few archaeological finds dating from 1933 and beyond indicate that the site or vicinity of Shiraz was likely settled in the pre-Islamic era as early as the 6th century BCE. A number of Achaemenid and Sasanian-era remains have been discovered around the city, including reliefs at Barm-e Delak to the east and Guyim to the northwest, and ruins of Sasanian fortresses at Qasr-e Abu Nasr to the east and Fahandezh. The latter is identified with the fortress of Shahmobad mentioned as being in Shiraz by the 10th-century geographical work, &quot;Hudud al-&#x27;alam&quot;. the Sasanian and early Islamic-era clay seals found at Qasr-e-Abu Nasr mention the name &quot;Shiraz&quot; alongside the name of the Sasanian administrative district of the area, Ardashir-Khwarrah. According to the diplomat and academic John Limbert, this indicates that the name &quot;Shiraz&quot; is traced back to the Elamite &quot;Shirrazish&quot; and that both refer to a settlement that existed at the site of Qasr-e-Abu Nasr.

Interpretations of what type of settlement ancient Shiraz was vary. According to Berney and Ring, the lack of references to Shiraz in early Persian sources suggests the city could not have been more than a way-station in the plain in which it lies. On the other hand, according to Abdolmajed Arfaee, Achaemenid-era Shiraz must have been one of the most important settlements in the area. He bases this on its frequent appearance in the Persepolis Administrative Archives (84 different tablets) as well as the number of workers present – in groups as large as 490. Most textual references to Shiraz involve rations for workers; it is never mentioned as a travel destination. Arfaee says that Sasanian Shiraz was relatively insignificant before its re-foundation in the early Islamic period. According to John Limbert, however, Shiraz prospered between the 6th and 8th-centuries CE and was possibly the administrative center for the Shiraz plain until the modern city of Shiraz was founded.

===Early Islamic era===
Shiraz was founded or restored in 693 by Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi, the brother of the Umayyad viceroy of the eastern half of the caliphate, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, or the latter&#x27;s kinsman Muhammad ibn Qasim. The Arab Muslim army had conquered the wider region of Fars, where the site of Shiraz is located, in several expeditions launched from their garrison town of Basra between 640 and 653, and specifically captured the immediate area around Shiraz early on, in 641. This area did not possess any cities, though there were a number of forts which were forced to pay tribute to the Arabs. The Sasanians held firm in Istakhr, their capital in Fars, until the Arabs captured it in a heavy battle in 653, during which the plain of Shiraz had been utilized as an Arab campground. Because of Istakhr&#x27;s deep association with the Sasanian Empire and the Zoroastrian religion, the Arabs sought to establish in nearby Shiraz a rival cultural and administrative center. Thus, during its initial founding in 693, the city was planned to be much larger than Isfahan. However, the initial ambitions were not realized and Shiraz remained a &quot;provincial backwater&quot; in the shadow of Istakhr until at least the late 9th century, according to Limbert. This is partly attributed to the reticence of the largely Zoroastrian population of Fars to inhabit the Islamic Arab city. As the population gradually shifted to Islam from Zoroastrianism and Istakhr concurrently declined, Shiraz grew into the practical center of Fars.

According to Muslim traditional sources, Shiraz was used as a hideout by three of the brothers of the Shia Muslim imam Ali al-Ridha following the latter&#x27;s death in 817/18 and later by one of the brothers&#x27; sons, Ali ibn Hamza ibn Musa, until he was found and executed by the Abbasid authorities in . As Abbasid authority waned during this period, regional dynasties emerged with considerable autonomy. In the late 9th century, the Iranian Muslim Saffarid dynasty under Ya&#x27;qub ibn al-Layth made Shiraz the capital of their autonomous state, which encompassed most of modern-day Iran. In 894, Ya&#x27;qub&#x27;s brother and successor, Amr, founded the city&#x27;s first congregational mosque, today known as the Atigh Jame&#x27; Mosque.

The Iranian Buyid dynasty under Imad al-Dawla Ali ibn Buya ousted the Saffarids in 933 and his nephew and successor, &#x27;Adud al-Dawla Fana Khusraw, took over and ruled Fars between 949 and 983, and added Iraq, the seat of the Abbasid Caliphate, to his Shiraz-based domains in 977; the Abbasids thenceforth became a puppet state of the Shiraz-based dynasty. Shiraz developed into the largest and most prosperous city of Fars and an important economic and cultural center of the caliphate. Adud al-Dawla had a large library, a hospital and several mosques, bazaars, caravanserais, palaces and gardens built in the city, while south of it he erected a fortified camp for his troops, known as Kard Fana Khusraw, in 974. One of the congregational mosques built by Adud al-Dawla has survived until the present day. Two Zoroastrian fire temples also existed in Shiraz, catering to the Persians who had not converted to Islam. One of Adud al-Dawla&#x27;s palaces stretched out for nearly three miles and consisted of 360 rooms.

Under the Buyids, Shiraz was divided into twelve quarters and had eight gates. It owed its economic prosperity to the booming agricultural trade of Fars. The city largely consumed the agricultural products of the province, including grapes, linen, wool, cotton, collyrium, rose, violet and palm-blossom water. It was also a market for rug weavers and painters to sell their pricey products, a testament to the residents&#x27; wealth. At the time, wine, grains, gold and silver were exported from the Farsi port cities of Siraf and Najairam. Adud al-Dawla patronized scientific, medical and Islamic religious research in Shiraz.

The city was spared destruction by the invading Mongols, when its local ruler offered tributes and submission to Genghis Khan. Shiraz was again spared by Tamerlane, when in 1382 the local monarch, Shah Shoja agreed to submit to the invader. In the 13th century, Shiraz became a leading center of the arts and letters, thanks to the encouragement of its ruler and the presence of many Persian scholars and artists. For this reason the city was named by classical geographers &quot;Dar al-&#x27;Elm&quot;, the House of Knowledge. Among the Iranian poets, mystics and philosophers born in Shiraz were the poets Sa&#x27;di and Hafiz, the mystic Ruzbehan, and the philosopher Mulla Sadra. Thus Shiraz has been nicknamed &quot;The Athens of Iran&quot;.
As early as the 11th century, several hundred thousand people inhabited Shiraz. In the 14th century Shiraz had sixty thousand inhabitants. During the 16th century it had a population of 200,000 people, which by the mid-18th century had decreased to only 55,000.

===Safavid Empire===
In 1504, Shiraz was captured by the forces of Ismail I, the founder of the Safavid Eynasty. Throughout the Safavid empire (1501–1722) Shiraz remained a provincial capital and Emam Qoli Khan, the governor of Fars under Abbas the Great, constructed many palaces and ornate buildings in the same style as those built during the same period in Isfahan, the capital of the Empire. After the fall of the Safavids, Shiraz suffered a period of decline, worsened by the raids of the Afghans and the rebellion of its governor against Nader Shah; the latter sent troops to suppress the revolt. The city was besieged for many months and eventually sacked. At the time of Nader Shah&#x27;s murder in 1747, most of the historical buildings of the city were damaged or ruined, and its population fell to 50,000, one-quarter of that during the 16th century.

Shiraz soon returned to prosperity under the rule of Karim Khan Zand, who made it his capital in 1762. Employing more than 12,000 workers, he constructed a royal district with a fortress, many administrative buildings, a mosque, and one of the finest covered bazaars in Iran. He had a moat built around the city, constructed an irrigation and drainage system, and rebuilt the city walls. However, Karim Khan&#x27;s heirs failed to secure his gains. When Agha Mohammad Khan, the founder of the Qajar dynasty, eventually came to power, he wreaked his revenge on Shiraz by destroying the city&#x27;s fortifications and moving the national capital to Tehran. Although lowered to the rank of a provincial capital, Shiraz maintained a level of prosperity as a result of the continuing importance of the trade route to the Persian Gulf. Its governorship was a royal prerogative throughout the Qajar dynasty. Many of the famous gardens, buildings and residences built during this time contribute to the city&#x27;s present skyline.

Shiraz is the birthplace of the co-founder of the Baháʼí Faith, the Báb (Siyyid &#x27;Ali-Muhammad, 1819–1850). In this city, on the evening of 22 May 1844, he first declared his mission as the bearer of a new divine revelation. For this reason Shiraz is a holy city for Baháʼís, and the city, particularly the house of the Báb, was identified as a place of pilgrimage. Due to the hostile climate towards Baháʼís in Iran, the house has been the target of repeated attacks; the house was destroyed in 1979, to be paved over two years later and made into a public square.

In 1910, a pogrom of the Jewish quarter started after false rumours that the Jews had ritually murdered a Muslim girl. In the course of the riots, 12 Jews were murdered and about 50 were injured, and the 6,000 Jews of Shiraz were robbed of all their possessions.

During the Pahlavi dynasty, Shiraz became the center of attention again. Many important landmarks like Tombs of Poets&#x27; such as Sa&#x27;di and Hafiz, were constructed and presented to the public.

Lacking any great industrial, religious or strategic importance, Shiraz became an administrative center, although its population has nevertheless grown considerably since the Iranian Revolution.


===Modern times===
The city&#x27;s municipality and other related institutions have initiated restoration and reconstruction projects.

Some of the most recent projects have been the complete restoration of the Arg of Karim Khan and of the Vakil Bath, as well as a comprehensive plan for the preservation of the old city quarters. Other noteworthy initiatives include the total renovation of the Qur&#x27;an Gate and the mausoleum of the poet Khwaju Kermani, both located in the Allah-u-Akbar Gorge, as well as the restoration and expansion of the mausoleum of the famous Shiraz-born poets Hafiz and Saadi.

Several different construction projects are currently underway that will modernize the city&#x27;s infrastructure.

==Demographics==
===Ethnicity===
The majority of the population are Persian. Most of the population of Shiraz are Muslim. Shiraz also was home to a 20,000-strong Jewish community, although most emigrated to the United States and Israel in the latter half of the 20th century. Along with Tehran and Isfahan, Shiraz is one of the handful of Iranian cities with a sizable Jewish population and more than one active synagogue. Shiraz also has a significant Baháʼí Faith population, the largest in the country after Tehran. There are currently two functioning churches in Shiraz, one Armenian and the other Anglican.

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 1,204,882 in 265,637 households. The following census in 2011 counted 1,460,665 people in 416,141 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 1,565,572 people in 477,916 households.

==Geography==
The city of Shiraz, the capital of Fars province, is located at 52 degrees 32 minutes east longitude and 29 degrees 36 minutes north latitude, and is 919 kilometers from Tehran. In the first official census of Iran in 1335, the city of Shiraz with a population of 170,659 people was the sixth most populous city in Iran. Shiraz is located in the south of Iran and the northwest of Fars province. It is built in a green plain at the foot of the Zagros Mountains above sea level. Shiraz is south of Tehran.

A seasonal river, Dry River, flows through the northern part of the city and on into Maharloo Lake. As of 1920, the area had a large forest of oak trees.

===Gardens===
Shiraz contains a considerable number of gardens. Due to population growth in the city, many of these gardens may be lost to give way to new developments. Although some measures have been taken by the Municipality to preserve these gardens, many illegal developments still endanger them.

===Climate===
Shiraz&#x27;s climate has distinct seasons, and is overall classed as a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;, bordering &quot;BSk&quot;). Summers are hot, with a July average high of . Winters are cool, with average low temperatures below freezing in January. Around of rain falls each year, almost entirely in the winter months, though in some cases as much as this has fallen in a single month (as in January 1965 and December 2004), whilst in the year from July 1965 to June 1966 as little as fell. The wettest year has been 1955/1956 with as much as , though since 1959 the highest has been around in each of 1995/1996 and 2004/2005. Due to Shiraz&#x27; high elevation and low latitude, the UV index is extremely high during summer which is further exacerbated by the high frequency of sunshine.

Despite being in a relatively dry climate, extreme weather is not a rare occasion. On 25 March 2019, flash floods from heavy rains has resulted in 19 deaths and over 200 injuries.

The highest record temperature was on 3 July 2022 and the lowest record temperature was on 5 January 1973.

==Economy==
Shiraz is the economic center of southern Iran. The second half of the 19th century witnessed certain economic developments that greatly changed the economy of Shiraz. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 allowed the extensive import into southern Iran of inexpensive European factory-made goods, either directly from Europe or via India. Farmers in unprecedented numbers began planting cash crops such as opium poppy, tobacco, and cotton. Many of these export crops passed through Shiraz on their way to the Persian Gulf. Iranian long-distance merchants from Fars developed marketing networks for these commodities, establishing trading houses in Bombay, Calcutta, Port Said, Istanbul and even Hong Kong.

Shiraz&#x27;s economic base is in its provincial products, which include grapes, citrus fruits, cotton and rice. Industries such as cement production, sugar, fertilizers, textile products, wood products, metalwork and rugs dominate. Shirāz also has a major oil refinery and is also a major center for Iran&#x27;s electronic industries. 53% of Iran&#x27;s electronic investment has been centered in Shiraz.

The Shiraz Special Economic Zone or the SEEZ was established in 2000 with the purpose of boosting manufacturing in electronics and communications.

Shiraz is a major shopping destination in Iran and the Middle East, with more than 25 malls and 10 bazaars.

The Persian Gulf Complex, located at the north end of the city, is the largest mall in the world in terms of the number of shops.

The city is served by Refah Chain Stores Co., Iran Hyper Star, Isfahan City Center, Shahrvand Chain Stores Inc., and Ofoq Kourosh chain store.


==Culture==
Shiraz is known as the city of poets, gardens, wine, nightingales and flowers.

The garden is an important part of Iranian culture. There are many old gardens in Shiraz such as the Eram garden and the Afif abad garden. According to some people, Shiraz &quot;disputes with Xeres [or Jerez] in Spain the honour of being the birthplace of sherry.&quot; Shirazi wine originates from the city; however, under the current Islamic regime, liquor cannot be consumed except by religious minorities.

Shiraz is proud of being mother land of Hafiz Shirazi. Shiraz is a center for Iranian culture and has produced a number of famous poets. Saadi, a 12th- and 13th-century poet was born in Shiraz. He left his native town at a young age for Baghdad to study Arabic literature and Islamic sciences at Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad. When he reappeared in his native Shiraz, he was an elderly man. Shiraz, under Atabak Abubakr Sa&#x27;d ibn Zangy (1231–1260) was enjoying an era of relative tranquility. Saadi was not only welcomed to the city but he was highly respected by the ruler and enumerated among the greats of the province. He seems to have spent the rest of his life in Shiraz. Hafiz, another famous poet and mystic was also born in Shiraz. A number of scientists also originate from Shiraz. Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi, a 13th-century astronomer, mathematician, physician, physicist and scientist was from Shiraz. In his &quot;The Limit of Accomplishment concerning Knowledge of the Heavens&quot;, he also discussed the possibility of heliocentrism.

<doc id="39623" wikidata="Q332720" url="?curid=39623" title="Syrah">
<text>Syrah (), also known as Shiraz, is a dark-skinned grape variety grown throughout the world and used primarily to produce red wine. In 1999, Syrah was found to be the offspring of two obscure grapes from southeastern France, Dureza and Mondeuse Blanche. Syrah should not be confused with Petite Sirah, a cross of Syrah with Peloursin dating from 1880.

The style and flavor profile of wines made from Syrah are influenced by the climate where the grapes are grown. In moderate climates (such as the northern Rhone Valley and parts of the Walla Walla AVA in Washington State), they tend to produce medium to full-bodied wines with medium-plus to high levels of tannins and notes of blackberry, mint and black pepper.

In hot climates (such as Crete, and the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale regions of Australia), Syrah is more consistently full-bodied with softer tannin, jammier fruit and spice notes of licorice, anise and earthy leather.

In many regions the acidity and tannin levels of Syrah allow the wines produced to have favorable aging potential.

Syrah is used as a single varietal or as a blend. Following several years of strong planting, Syrah was estimated in 2004 to be the world&#x27;s 7th most grown grape at .

It can be found throughout the globe from France to New World wine regions such as: Chile, South Africa, the Hawke&#x27;s Bay and Waiheke in New Zealand, California and Washington.

It can also be found in several Australian wine regions such as the Barossa, Heathcote, Coonawarra, Hunter Valley, Margaret River, Adelaide Hills, Clare Valley and McLaren Vale.

== History ==
=== Origin ===
Syrah has a long documented history in the Rhône region of southeastern France, but it was not known if it had originated in that region.

A 1998 study conducted by Carole Meredith&#x27;s research group in the Department of Viticulture and Enology at University of California, Davis used DNA typing and extensive grape reference material from the viticultural research station in Montpellier, France to conclude that Syrah was the offspring of the grape varieties Dureza (father) and Mondeuse blanche (mother).
Dureza, a dark-skinned grape variety from the Ardèche region in France, has all but disappeared from the vineyards, and the preservation of such varieties is a speciality of Montpellier. Mondeuse blanche is a white grape variety cultivated in the Savoie region, and is still found in small amounts in that region&#x27;s vineyards today.

Both varieties are somewhat obscure today, and have never achieved anything near Syrah&#x27;s fame or popularity, and there is no record of them ever having been cultivated at long distances from their present homes. Thus, both of Syrah&#x27;s parents come from a limited area in southeastern France, close to northern Rhône. Based on these findings, the researchers have concluded Syrah originated from northern Rhône.

The DNA typing leaves no room for doubt in this matter, and the numerous other hypotheses of the grape&#x27;s origin which have been forwarded during the years all completely lack support in the form of documentary evidence or ampelographic investigations, be it by methods of classical botany or DNA.

Instead, they seem to have been based primarily or solely on the name or synonyms of the variety. Varying orthography for grape names render dubious any name-based evidence of origins. Nevertheless, origins such as Syracuse or the famous Iranian city of Shiraz had been proposed while the genomic studies had yet to be done.

The parentage information, however, does not reveal how old the grape variety is, i.e., when the pollination of a Mondeuse blanche vine by Dureza took place, leading to the original Syrah seed plant. In the year 77 CE, Pliny the Elder wrote in his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; about the wines of Vienne (which today would be called Côte-Rôtie), where the Allobroges made famous and prized wine from a dark-skinned grape variety that had not existed some 50 years earlier, in Virgil&#x27;s age.

 Pliny called the vines of this wine &quot;Allobrogica&quot;, and it has been speculated that it could be today&#x27;s Syrah. However, the description of the wine would also fit, for example, Dureza, and Pliny&#x27;s observation that vines of Allobrogica were resistant to cold is not entirely consistent with Syrah.

=== The names Syrah and Shiraz===
The grape&#x27;s many other synonyms are used in various parts of the world, including &quot;Antourenein noir&quot;, &quot;Balsamina&quot;, &quot;Candive&quot;, &quot;Entournerein&quot;, &quot;Hignin noir&quot;, &quot;Marsanne noir&quot;, &quot;Schiras&quot;, &quot;Sirac&quot;, &quot;Syra&quot;, &quot;Syrac&quot;, &quot;Serine&quot;, and &quot;Sereine&quot;.

Legends of Syrah&#x27;s origins often connect it with the city of Shiraz in ancient Iran. The former capital of the Persian Empire under the Achaemenid dynasty produced the well-known Shirazi wine, and legends claim the original grape was later brought to the Rhône. At least two significantly different versions of the myth are reported, giving different accounts of how the grape variety is supposed to have travelled, differing up to 1,800 years in dating the event. 

In one version, the Phocaeans could have brought Syrah to their colony around Marseille, then known as Massilia, an ancient Greek colony (&quot;apoikia&quot;) on the Mediterranean coast, east of the Rhône, which was founded around 600 BCE by the ancient Greeks. The grape would then later have spread to the northern Rhône, which was never colonized by the Phocaeans. No documentary evidence exists to back up this legend, and it also requires the variety to later vanish from the Marseille region without leaving any trace.
The legend connecting Syrah&#x27;s origins with the city of Shiraz in ancient Iran may, however, be of French origin. James Busby wrote in his &quot;Journal of a recent visit to the principal vineyards of Spain and France&quot; an excerpt from the 1826 book &quot;Œnologie Française&quot;; &quot;according to the tradition of the neighbourhood, the plant [Scyras] was originally brought from Shiraz in Persia, by one of the hermits of the mountain&quot; called Gaspare de Stérimberg.

There is a connection between the name &quot;Syrah&quot; and the Persian word &quot;سیاه&quot; (pronounced &quot;siah&quot; or &quot;syah&quot;, meaning &quot;black&quot;). It refers to the origin of this grape, which comes from black grapes and shows connection between the city of Shiraz and this grape. Another legend of the grape variety&#x27;s origin, based on the name &quot;Syrah&quot;, is that it was brought from Syracuse by the legions of Roman Emperor Probus sometime after 280 CE. This legend also lacks documentary evidence and is inconsistent with ampelographic findings.

Another proposed etymology links it with the Proto-Celtic word *&quot;serra&quot; &#x27;billhook&#x27;, presumably because the billhook was used in pruning.

The name &quot;Shiraz&quot; has been used primarily in Australia in modern times, where it has long been established as the most grown dark-skinned variety. In Australia, it was also commonly called Hermitage up to the late 1980s, but since that name became a French Protected Designation of Origin, this naming practice caused a problem in some export markets and was dropped. The name &quot;Scyras&quot; was used to describe the grape in the earliest Australian documents, and &quot;Shiraz&quot; has been speculated (among others by Jancis Robinson) to have come about through the &quot;strinization&quot; of the original word, a process of changing vowels as part of Australian slang. However, while the names &quot;Shiraz&quot; and &quot;Hermitage&quot; gradually replaced &quot;Scyras&quot; in Australia from the mid-19th century, the spelling &quot;Shiraz&quot; has also been documented in British sources back to at least the 1830s. So while the name or spelling &quot;Shiraz&quot; may be an effect of the English language on a French name, there is no evidence that it actually originated in Australia, although it was definitely the Australian usage and the Australian wines that made the use of this name popular.

=== Rise to fame ===
The wines that made Syrah famous were those from Hermitage, the hill above the town Tain-l&#x27;Hermitage in northern Rhône, where an hermitage (chapel) was built on the top, and where De Stérimberg is supposed to have settled as a hermit after his crusades. Hermitage wines have for centuries had a reputation for being powerful and excellent. While Hermitage was quite famous in the 18th and 19th centuries, and attracted interest from foreign oenophiles, such as Bordeaux enthusiast Thomas Jefferson, it lost ground and foreign attention in the first half of the 20th century.

In the 18th and the first half of the 19th centuries, most Hermitage wine that left France did so as a blending component in Bordeaux wines. In an era when &quot;clarets&quot; were less powerful than today, and before appellation rules, red wines from warmer regions would be used for improvement (or adulteration, depending on the point of view) of Bordeaux wines. While Spanish and Algerian wines are also known to have been used for this purpose, top Bordeaux châteaux would use Hermitage to improve their wines, especially in weaker vintages.

=== Arrival in Australia ===
In 1831, the Scotsman James Busby, often called &quot;the Father of Australian viticulture&quot;, made a trip back to Europe to collect cuttings from vines (primarily from France and Spain) for introduction to Australia. One of the varieties collected by him was Syrah, although Busby used the two spellings &quot;Scyras&quot; and &quot;Ciras&quot;. The cuttings were planted in the Royal Botanic Garden, and in Hunter Valley, and in 1839 brought from Sydney to South Australia. By the 1860s, Syrah was established as an important variety in Australia.

=== Modern history ===
Syrah continues to be the main grape of the northern Rhône and is associated with classic wines such as Hermitage, Cornas and Côte-Rôtie. In the southern Rhône, it is used as a blending grape in such wines as Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Gigondas and Côtes du Rhône, where Grenache usually makes up the bulk of the blend. Although its best incarnations will age for decades, less-extracted styles may be enjoyed young for their lively red and blueberry characters and smooth tannin structure. Syrah has been widely used as a blending grape in the red wines of many countries due to its fleshy fruit mid-palate, balancing the weaknesses of other varieties and resulting in a &quot;complete&quot; wine.

From the 1970s and even more from the 1990s, Syrah has enjoyed increased popularity, and plantings of the variety have expanded significantly in both old and new locations. In the early 2000s, it broke into the top 10 of varieties planted worldwide for the first time.

== Shiraz wines ==
The name &quot;Shiraz&quot;, from Shiraz in Iran, was historically applied to a wine unrelated to contemporary Shiraz wines and was made from a grape or grapes entirely different from the Syrah that has been proven to originate in southeastern France.

Smaller amounts of Syrah are also used in the production of other wine styles, such as rosé wine, fortified wine in Port wine style, and sparkling red wine. While Australian sparkling Shiraz traditionally have had some sweetness, a number of Australian winemakers also make a full-bodied sparkling dry Shiraz, which contains the complexity and sometimes earthy notes that are normally found in still wine.

Due to their concentrated flavours and high tannin content, many premium Syrah wines are at their best after some considerable bottle aging. In exceptional cases, this may be 15 years or longer.

Syrah has one of the highest recommended wine serving temperatures at 18 °C (65 °F).

=== Taste and flavours ===
Wines made from Syrah are often powerfully flavoured and full-bodied. The variety produces wines with a wide range of flavor notes, depending on the climate and soils where it is grown, as well as other viticultural practices chosen. Aroma characters can range from violets to berries (usually dark as opposed to red), chocolate, and black pepper. No one aroma can be called typical though blackberry, coffee and pepper are often noticed. With time in the bottle these primary notes are moderated and then supplemented with earthy or savory tertiary notes such as leather and truffle. Secondary flavor and aroma notes are those associated with several things, generally winemakers&#x27; practices (such as oak barrel and yeast treatment).

C13-Norisoprenoids such as derivatives, such as and , are found in Shiraz leaves.

=== Syrah or Shiraz on labels ===

The Syrah-dominated appellations (AOCs) of northern Rhône have, like most other French appellations and regions, no tradition of varietal labeling of their wines. Indeed, such practices are generally disallowed under AOC rules, and only the AOC name (such as Cote-Rotie, Crozes-Hermitage or Hermitage) appears on the label. Varietal labeling of Syrah/Shiraz wines is therefore a practice that has emerged in the New World, primarily in Australia.

To confuse matters, in northern Rhône, different clones of genuine Syrah are referred to as &quot;Petite Syrah&quot; (small Syrah) or &quot;Gros Syrah&quot; (large Syrah) depending on the size of their berries, with &quot;Petite Syrah&quot; being considered the superior version, giving wines higher in phenolics.

As a general rule, most Australian and South African wines are labeled &quot;Shiraz&quot;, and most European wines (from such regions where varietal labeling is practiced) are labeled &quot;Syrah&quot;. In other countries, practices vary and winemakers (or wine marketers) sometimes choose either &quot;Syrah&quot; or &quot;Shiraz&quot; to signify a stylistic difference in the wine they have made. &quot;Syrah&quot;-labelled wines are sometimes thought to be more similar to classic Northern Rhône reds; presumably more elegant, tannic, smoke-flavoured and restrained with respect to their fruit component. &quot;Shiraz&quot;-labelled wines, on the other hand, would then be more similar to archetypical Australian or other New World examples, presumably made from riper berries, more fruit-driven, higher in alcohol, less obviously tannic, peppery rather than smokey, usually more easily approached when young, and possibly slightly sweetish in impression. It must, however, be realized that this rule of thumb is unevenly applied.

== Syrah in different countries ==
Syrah is a variety that during the last few decades has been imported for cultivation in several countries. It is primarily grown in warmer regions. Worldwide plantations of Syrah have increased considerably in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and both &quot;Syrah&quot;-labelled and &quot;Shiraz&quot;-labelled wines are on the increase.

It is grown in many wine producing regions around the world, with concentrations in Australia, The Rhone Valley in France, and the US. It is often used as a blending grape in Spain and Italy as well. It is also planted in Portugal, which favor making varietal Syrah wine, and not only blending with other types.

=== Italy ===
In Italy, Syrah is grown in Tuscany (i.e. Cortona DOC), Lazio (Pontine Agro), and Apulia (Syrah Tarantino IGT). Also a DOC Sirah Piedmont exists. The region though which has made one of the best uses of Syrah, by blending it with Nero d&#x27;Avola grapes, is Sicily.

=== France ===

Syrah, as it is known in France, is grown throughout the Rhône valley. The wines that are made from it vary greatly, even over small changes in the location of the vines. The differences in the soil quality as well as the changes in the slope of the terrain tend to produce different styles of wine. Ranging from the mineral and tannic nature of Hermitage, to fruity and perfumed in the case of Côte-Rôtie.

Syrah is also a key component to many blends. It may be used to add structure and color to Grenache in southern Rhône blends, including Côtes-du-Rhône and Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Syrah is also the only red grape used in the wines of the northern Rhône.

In 1968, there existed only of Syrah vineyards in France, primarily in the traditional appellations of northern Rhône, which at that time had not received much attention in the wine world for several decades, and the vineyards of which were not planted to full capacity. After the wines of northern Rhône were &quot;rediscovered&quot; by wine writers in the 1970s, plantings expanded considerably. This trend received an extra boost in the 1980s and 1990s, when influential wine writer Robert M. Parker Jr. awarded high scores, up to the &quot;perfect&quot; score of 100 points, to wines of some Rhône producers. The popularity of Australian Shiraz on the export market may also have played a role. In 1988, total French plantings stood at , and the 1999 viticultural survey found of Syrah vineyards. France thus has the world&#x27;s largest plantations of Syrah.

While previously unused parts of the northern Rhône vineyards have been planted with Syrah as part of the expansion, the major part of the new French Syrah plantations are located in southern Rhône (which covers a much larger vineyard area than the northern part) and Languedoc-Roussillon. While southern Rhône produces relatively few wines where Syrah is in the majority, the proportion of Syrah in the blended wines of this region has been on the rise. Languedoc-Roussillon uses Syrah to produce both Southern Rhône-like blends with Grenache, Australian-style blends with Cabernet Sauvignon, and varietal Syrah.

Syrah vines in France often suffer from a form of dieback characterised by the leaves turning red in late summer, deep cracks developing in the stem above the graft, and the premature death of the vine. The syndrome was first observed in 1990s in the Gard and Hérault departments of Southern of France, but is now widespread. It is believed to be caused by mismatch between the rootstock and scion rather than an infection by a fungus or a virus.

=== Spain ===
In Spain there was an increase in the area cultivated in Syrah grapes from in 1990 to in 2009. It is grown primarily in Castilla-La Mancha, with lesser amounts in Aragon and Catalonia. As of 2015 it was the seventh most grown red grape in Spain, with accounting for 4% of the red grape total.

=== Switzerland ===
The Syrah grape was introduced into Switzerland in 1926 and in 2009 was the 6th most common red wine grape in Switzerland (181 hectares). Mostly grown in Valais, along the upper Rhône valley above Lake Geneva, it produces &quot;unexpectedly concentrated wine from mature vines&quot;.

=== Argentina ===
Syrah plantations in Argentina increased from less than in 1990 to in 2002. Syrah has occasionally been used as a blending component with Argentina&#x27;s signature dark-skinned grape Malbec to provide an &quot;Argentinian take&quot; on the Australian Cabernet-Shiraz blend.

=== Australia ===
The Syrah grape was introduced into Australia in 1832 by James Busby, an immigrant who brought vine clippings from Europe with him, and it is almost invariably called &quot;Shiraz&quot;. Today it is Australia&#x27;s most popular red grape, but has not always been in such favour; in the 1970s, white wine was so popular that growers were ripping out unprofitable Shiraz and Grenache vineyards, even those with old vines. In the Barossa Valley, the world&#x27;s oldest continually producing commercial vineyard is believed to be the Shiraz vines at Turkey Flat in Tanunda that were originally planted in 1847.

Many factors, including the success of brands like Lindemans (part of Treasury Wine Estates) and Jacob&#x27;s Creek in the UK, as well as Rosemount in the US and UK, were responsible for a dramatic expansion of plantings during the 1980s and 1990s; a similar trajectory occurred in California. However, the biggest factor in this expansion during the 1990s was a steady increase in exports due to the historically low value of the Australian dollar.

In the 2005–2006 growing season, total Shiraz plantations in Australia stood at , of which were old enough to be productive. These vines yielded a total of 422,430 tonnes of Shiraz grapes for wine production. This made Shiraz the most planted variety in Australia and Australia the world&#x27;s second largest Syrah/Shiraz grower, after France.

Victorian regions include Heathcote, roughly 1.5 hours north of Melbourne. Cooler climate regions such as Western Australia&#x27;s Margaret River produce Shiraz with marginally less alcohol content and often in a more traditional French style.

A well-known example of the Shiraz grape in Australian viticulture is the Penfolds &quot;Grange&quot;. This wine was created by winemaker Max Schubert in 1951 and has a reputation for aging well. The Penfolds Grange is predominantly Shiraz but often includes a small quantity of Cabernet Sauvignon. It is usually a multi-regional blend of quality South Australian Shiraz, with the Barossa Valley playing an important role, and matured in new American Oak. Other well-known Australian Shiraz wines include the Henschke &quot;Hill of Grace&quot; and the Penfolds &quot;RWT&quot;.

Recently, Australian Shiraz producers have started to add up to 4% Viognier to their Shiraz to add apricot tones to the wine&#x27;s nose and palate. With such a small percentage added, the producer wasn&#x27;t obliged to declare the blend on the label. In the past 5 years, however, it&#x27;s becoming increasingly fashionable to label the wine &quot;Shiraz Viognier&quot; as Viognier gains consumer acceptance in the marketplace. The practise of blending Viognier with Syrah has actually been common for years in the Northern Rhône Valley region of Cote-Rotie.

&quot;Shiraz&quot; is also the S in &quot;GSM&quot; (Grenache-Shiraz-Mourvèdre), which is common Australian designation for a Châteneuf-du-Pape-like blend.

=== South Africa ===
South African plantations have expanded significantly, from 1% of the vineyard area in 1995 to 9.7% in 2007 making up a total area under cultivation of . In South Africa, the variety is predominately known as &quot;Shiraz&quot;, but the designation &quot;Syrah&quot; is used for &quot;Rhône-style&quot; wines. Some see this variety as the &quot;great hope&quot; for South African wines.

=== United States ===

In the United States, wine produced from the grape is normally called by its French name, &quot;Syrah&quot;. However, in cases where winemakers choose to follow a New World style, similar to Penfolds Grange, they may choose to label their wines as &quot;Shiraz&quot;. Under American wine laws, either name may appear on the label. Syrah first appeared as a wine grape in California in the 1970s, where it was planted by a group of viticulturists who called themselves &quot;Rhône rangers&quot;. Although most plantings of the grape are in California, there are increasing amounts of it being grown in Washington state. Syrah makes up a significant percentage of wine produced in several Washington AVAs such as the Naches Heights AVA and the Walla Walla AVA. Syrah is increasingly being grown and produced in Oregon. Syrah is also found in small regions in Ohio.
California Syrahs, much like those in France, vary a great deal based on the climate and &quot;terroir&quot; that they inhabit. In exceptionally warm regions, such as parts of Napa, the wine is often blended with other Rhône varieties. Other appellations, primarily mountainous ones, tend to produce varietal-based wines that can stand on their own. Syrah was introduced into Washington state in 1986 by Red Willow Vineyard through their partnership with Woodinville, Washington-based Columbia Winery and Master of Wine David Lake. Expanding at a significant rate, it is used to produce single-varietial wines as well as being blended with grapes such as Grenache, Mourvèdre, Cinsault and Viognier.

=== Chile ===
Around 2005, there were of Syrah in Chile.

== Durif ==
Durif, or Petite Sirah, is a descendant of Syrah and Peloursin. It was propagated by and named after Dr. Francois Durif. Durif is a cross breed between the lesser known Peloursin and Syrah. Regions such as Rutherglen have achieved international regard for their Durif. This varietal is similar to Shiraz but is even more full-bodied and tannic because of the smaller, thicker-skinned grapes used. Petite Sirah is widely planted in California, where it is popular as a varietal (for example, by Bogle Vineyards), and especially blended with Zinfandel, which results in a rich, bold and fruity wine.

== Synonyms ==
Synonyms for Syrah include Antourenein noir, Candive, Entournerein, Hermitage, Hignin noir, Marsanne noir, Shiraz, Sira, Sirac, Sirah, Syra, and Syrac.

<text>Symbiosis (Ancient Greek : living with, companionship &lt; : together; and &quot;bíōsis&quot;: living) is any type of a close and long-term biological interaction, between two organisms of different species. The two organisms, termed symbionts, can be either in a mutualistic, a commensalistic, or a parasitic relationship. In 1879, Heinrich Anton de Bary defined symbiosis as &quot;the living together of unlike organisms&quot;. 

The term is sometimes more exclusively used in a restricted, mutualistic sense, where both symbionts contribute to each other&#x27;s subsistence. This means that they each benefit each other in some way. 

Symbiosis can be &quot;obligatory&quot;, which means that one, or both of the organisms depend on each other for survival, or &quot;facultative&quot; (optional), when they can also subsist independently. 

Symbiosis is also classified by physical attachment. Symbionts forming a single body live in &quot;conjunctive&quot; symbiosis, while all other arrangements are called &quot;disjunctive&quot; symbiosis. When one organism lives on the surface of another, such as head lice on humans, it is called ectosymbiosis; when one partner lives inside the tissues of another, such as &quot;Symbiodinium&quot; within coral, it is termed endosymbiosis.

== Definition ==

The definition of &quot;symbiosis&quot; was a matter of debate for 130 years. In 1877, Albert Bernhard Frank used the term &quot;symbiosis&quot; to describe the mutualistic relationship in lichens. In 1878, the German mycologist Heinrich Anton de Bary defined it as &quot;the living together of unlike organisms&quot;. The definition has varied among scientists, with some advocating that it should only refer to persistent mutualisms, while others thought it should apply to all persistent biological interactions (in other words, to mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism, but excluding brief interactions such as predation). In the 21st century, the latter has become the definition widely accepted by biologists.

In 1949, Edward Haskell proposed an integrative approach with a classification of &quot;co-actions&quot;, later adopted by biologists as &quot;interactions&quot;.

== Types ==

=== Obligate versus facultative ===

Relationships can be obligate, meaning that one or both of the symbionts entirely depend on each other for survival. For example, in lichens, which consist of fungal and photosynthetic symbionts, the fungal partners cannot live on their own. The algal or cyanobacterial symbionts in lichens, such as &quot;Trentepohlia&quot;, can generally live independently, and their part of the relationship is therefore described as facultative (optional), or non-obligate. When one of the participants in a symbiotic relationship is capable of photosynthesis, as with lichens, it is called photosymbiosis.

=== Ectosymbiosis versus endosymbiosis ===

Ectosymbiosis is any symbiotic relationship in which the symbiont lives on the body surface of the host, including the inner surface of the digestive tract or the ducts of exocrine glands. Examples of this include ectoparasites such as lice; commensal ectosymbionts such as the barnacles, which attach themselves to the jaw of baleen whales; and mutualist ectosymbionts such as cleaner fish.

Contrastingly, endosymbiosis is any symbiotic relationship in which one symbiont lives within the tissues of the other, either within the cells or extracellularly. Examples include diverse microbiomes: rhizobia, nitrogen-fixing bacteria that live in root nodules on legume roots; actinomycetes, nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as &quot;Frankia&quot;, which live in alder root nodules; single-celled algae inside reef-building corals; and bacterial endosymbionts that provide essential nutrients to about 10%–15% of insects.

In endosymbiosis, the host cell lacks some of the nutrients which the endosymbiont provides. As a result, the host favors endosymbiont&#x27;s growth processes within itself by producing some specialized cells. These cells affect the genetic composition of the host in order to regulate the increasing population of the endosymbionts and ensure that these genetic changes are passed onto the offspring via vertical transmission (heredity).

As the endosymbiont adapts to the host&#x27;s lifestyle, the endosymbiont changes dramatically. There is a drastic reduction in its genome size, as many genes are lost during the process of metabolism, and DNA repair and recombination, while important genes participating in the DNA-to-RNA transcription, protein translation and DNA/RNA replication are retained. The decrease in genome size is due to loss of protein coding genes and not due to lessening of inter-genic regions or open reading frame (ORF) size. Species that are naturally evolving and contain reduced sizes of genes can be accounted for an increased number of noticeable differences between them, thereby leading to changes in their evolutionary rates. When endosymbiotic bacteria related with insects are passed on to the offspring strictly via vertical genetic transmission, intracellular bacteria go across many hurdles during the process, resulting in the decrease in effective population sizes, as compared to the free-living bacteria. The incapability of the endosymbiotic bacteria to reinstate their wild type phenotype via a recombination process is called &quot;Muller&#x27;s ratchet&quot; phenomenon. Muller&#x27;s ratchet phenomenon, together with less effective population sizes, leads to an accretion of deleterious mutations in the non-essential genes of the intracellular bacteria. This can be due to lack of selection mechanisms prevailing in the relatively &quot;rich&quot; host environment.

=== Competition ===

Competition can be defined as an interaction between organisms or species, in which the fitness of one is lowered by the presence of another.Competition can also occur between cells within the same organism which is why older cells are usually eliminated from tissues. This allows the organism to stay as healthy as possible by constantly eliminating old cells and making new ones. Limited supply of at least one resource (such as food, water, and territory) used by both usually facilitates this type of interaction, although the competition can also be for other resources.

=== Amensalism ===

Amensalism is a non-symbiotic, asymmetric interaction where one species is harmed or killed by the other, and one is unaffected by the other. There are two types of amensalism, competition and antagonism (or antibiosis). Competition is where a larger or stronger organism deprives a smaller or weaker one of a resource. Antagonism occurs when one organism is damaged or killed by another through a chemical secretion. An example of competition is a sapling growing under the shadow of a mature tree. The mature tree can rob the sapling of necessary sunlight and, if the mature tree is very large, it can take up rainwater and deplete soil nutrients. Throughout the process, the mature tree is unaffected by the sapling. Indeed, if the sapling dies, the mature tree gains nutrients from the decaying sapling. An example of antagonism is &quot;Juglans nigra&quot; (black walnut), secreting juglone, a substance which destroys many herbaceous plants within its root zone.

The term &quot;amensalism&quot; is often used to describe strongly asymmetrical competitive interactions, such as between the Spanish ibex and weevils of the genus &quot;Timarcha&quot; which feed upon the same type of shrub. Whilst the presence of the weevil has almost no influence on food availability, the presence of ibex has an enormous detrimental effect on weevil numbers, as they consume significant quantities of plant matter and incidentally ingest the weevils upon it.

=== Commensalism ===

Commensalism describes a relationship between two living organisms where one benefits and the other is not significantly harmed or helped. It is derived from the English word , used of human social interaction. It derives from a medieval Latin word meaning sharing food, formed from &quot;com-&quot; (with) and &quot;mensa&quot; (table).

Commensal relationships may involve one organism using another for transportation (phoresy) or for housing (inquilinism), or it may also involve one organism using something another created, after its death (metabiosis). Examples of metabiosis are hermit crabs using gastropod shells to protect their bodies, and spiders building their webs on plants.

=== Mutualism ===

Mutualism or interspecies reciprocal altruism is a long-term relationship between individuals of different species where both individuals benefit. Mutualistic relationships may be either obligate for both species, obligate for one but facultative for the other, or facultative for both.

Many herbivores have mutualistic gut flora to help them digest plant matter, which is more difficult to digest than animal prey. This gut flora comprises cellulose-digesting protozoans or bacteria living in the herbivores&#x27; intestines. Coral reefs result from mutualism between coral organisms and various algae living inside them. Most land plants and land ecosystems rely on mutualism between the plants, which fix carbon from the air, and mycorrhyzal fungi, which help in extracting water and minerals from the ground.

An example of mutualism is the relationship between the ocellaris clownfish that dwell among the tentacles of Ritteri sea anemones. The territorial fish protects the anemone from anemone-eating fish, and in turn, the anemone stinging tentacles protect the clownfish from its predators. A special mucus on the clownfish protects it from the stinging tentacles.

A further example is the goby, a fish which sometimes lives together with a shrimp. The shrimp digs and cleans up a burrow in the sand in which both the shrimp and the goby fish live. The shrimp is almost blind, leaving it vulnerable to predators when outside its burrow. In case of danger, the goby touches the shrimp with its tail to warn it, and both quickly retreat into the burrow. Different species of gobies (&quot;Elacatinus spp.&quot;) also clean up ectoparasites in other fish, possibly another kind of mutualism.

A spectacular example of obligate mutualism is the relationship between the siboglinid tube worms and symbiotic bacteria that live at hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. The worm has no digestive tract and is wholly reliant on its internal symbionts for nutrition. The bacteria oxidize either hydrogen sulfide or methane, which the host supplies to them. These worms were discovered in the late 1980s at the hydrothermal vents near the Galapagos Islands and have since been found at deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps in all of the world&#x27;s oceans.

Mutualism improves both organism&#x27;s competitive ability and will outcompete organisms of the same species that lack the symbiont.

A facultative symbiosis is seen in encrusting bryozoans and hermit crabs. The bryozoan colony (&quot;Acanthodesia commensale&quot;) develops a cirumrotatory growth and offers the crab (&quot;Pseudopagurus granulimanus&quot;) a helicospiral-tubular extension of its living chamber that initially was situated within a gastropod shell.

=== Parasitism ===

In a parasitic relationship, the parasite benefits while the host is harmed. Parasitism takes many forms, from endoparasites that live within the host&#x27;s body to ectoparasites and parasitic castrators that live on its surface and micropredators like mosquitoes that visit intermittently. Parasitism is an extremely successful mode of life; about 40% of all animal species are parasites, and the average mammal species is host to 4 nematodes, 2 cestodes, and 2 trematodes.

=== Mimicry ===

Mimicry is a form of symbiosis in which a species adopts distinct characteristics of another species to alter its relationship dynamic with the species being mimicked, to its own advantage. Among the many types of mimicry are Batesian and Müllerian, the first involving one-sided exploitation, the second providing mutual benefit. Batesian mimicry is an exploitative three-party interaction where one species, the mimic, has evolved to mimic another, the model, to deceive a third, the dupe. In terms of signalling theory, the mimic and model have evolved to send a signal; the dupe has evolved to receive it from the model. This is to the advantage of the mimic but to the detriment of both the model, whose protective signals are effectively weakened, and of the dupe, which is deprived of an edible prey. For example, a wasp is a strongly-defended model, which signals with its conspicuous black and yellow coloration that it is an unprofitable prey to predators such as birds which hunt by sight; many hoverflies are Batesian mimics of wasps, and any bird that avoids these hoverflies is a dupe. In contrast, Müllerian mimicry is mutually beneficial as all participants are both models and mimics. For example, different species of bumblebee mimic each other, with similar warning coloration in combinations of black, white, red, and yellow, and all of them benefit from the relationship.
=== Cleaning symbiosis ===

Cleaning symbiosis is an association between individuals of two species, where one (the cleaner) removes and eats parasites and other materials from the surface of the other (the client). It is putatively mutually beneficial, but biologists have long debated whether it is mutual selfishness, or simply exploitative. Cleaning symbiosis is well known among marine fish, where some small species of cleaner fish – notably wrasses, but also species in other genera – are specialized to feed almost exclusively by cleaning larger fish and other marine animals. In a supreme situation, the host species (fish or marine life) will display itself at a designated station deemed the &quot;cleaning station&quot;. 

Cleaner fish play an essential role in the reduction of parasitism on marine animals. Some shark species participate in cleaning symbiosis, where cleaner fish remove ectoparasites from the body of the shark. A study by Raymond Keyes addresses the atypical behavior of a few shark species when exposed to cleaner fish. In this experiment, cleaner wrasse &quot;(Labroides dimidiatus)&quot; and various shark species were placed in a tank together and observed. The different shark species exhibited different responses and behaviors around the wrasse. For example, Atlantic and Pacific lemon sharks consistently react to the wrasse fish in a fascinating way. During the interaction, the shark remains passive and the wrasse swims to it. It begins to scan the shark&#x27;s body, sometimes stopping to inspect specific areas. Commonly, the wrasse would inspect the gills, labial regions, and skin. When the wrasse makes its way to the mouth of the shark, the shark often ceases breathing for up to two and a half minutes so that the fish is able to scan the mouth. Then, the fish passes further into the mouth to examine the gills, specifically the buccopharyngeal area, which typically holds the most parasites. When the shark begins to close its mouth, the wrasse finishes its examination and goes elsewhere. Male bull sharks exhibit slightly different behavior at cleaning stations: as the shark swims into a colony of wrasse fish, it drastically slows its speed to allow the cleaners to do their job. After approximately one minute, the shark returns to normal swimming speed.

==Role in evolution==

Symbiosis is increasingly recognized as an important selective force behind evolution; many species have a long history of interdependent co-evolution.

Although symbiosis was once discounted as an anecdotal evolutionary phenomenon, evidence is now overwhelming that obligate or facultative associations among microorganisms and between microorganisms and multicellular hosts had crucial consequences in many landmark events in evolution and in the generation of phenotypic diversity and complex phenotypes able to colonise new environments.

Mutualistic symbiosis can sometimes evolve from parasitism or commensalism, Fungi&#x27;s relationship to plants in the form of mycelium evolved from parasitism and commensalism. Under certain conditions species of fungi previously in a state of mutualism can turn parasitic on weak or dying plants. Likewise the symbiotic relationship of clown fish and sea anemones emerged from a commensalist relationship.

=== Hologenome development and evolution ===

Evolution originated from changes in development where variations within species are selected for or against because of the symbionts involved. The hologenome theory relates to the holobiont and symbionts genome together as a whole. Microbes live everywhere in and on every multicellular organism. Many organisms rely on their symbionts in order to develop properly, this is known as co-development. In cases of co-development the symbionts send signals to their host which determine developmental processes. Co-development is commonly seen in both arthropods and vertebrates.

=== Symbiogenesis ===

One hypothesis for the origin of the nucleus in eukaryotes (plants, animals, fungi, and protists) is that it developed from a symbiogenesis between bacteria and archaea. It is hypothesized that the symbiosis originated when ancient archaea, similar to modern methanogenic archaea, invaded and lived within bacteria similar to modern myxobacteria, eventually forming the early nucleus. This theory is analogous to the accepted theory for the origin of eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are thought to have developed from a similar endosymbiotic relationship between proto-eukaryotes and aerobic bacteria. Evidence for this includes the fact that mitochondria and chloroplasts divide independently of the cell, and that these organelles have their own genome.

The biologist Lynn Margulis, famous for her work on endosymbiosis, contended that symbiosis is a major driving force behind evolution. She considered Darwin&#x27;s notion of evolution, driven by competition, to be incomplete and claimed that evolution is strongly based on co-operation, interaction, and mutual dependence among organisms. According to Margulis and her son Dorion Sagan, &quot;Life did not take over the globe by combat, but by networking.&quot;

==Major examples of co-evolutionary relationships== 

=== Mycorrhiza ===

About 80% of vascular plants worldwide form symbiotic relationships with fungi, in particular in arbuscular mycorrhizas.

=== Pollination ===

Flowering plants and the animals that pollinate them have co-evolved. Many plants that are pollinated by insects (in entomophily), bats, or birds (in ornithophily) have highly specialized flowers modified to promote pollination by a specific pollinator that is correspondingly adapted. The first flowering plants in the fossil record had relatively simple flowers. Adaptive speciation quickly gave rise to many diverse groups of plants, and, at the same time, corresponding speciation occurred in certain insect groups. Some groups of plants developed nectar and large sticky pollen, while insects evolved more specialized morphologies to access and collect these rich food sources. In some taxa of plants and insects, the relationship has become dependent, where the plant species can only be pollinated by one species of insect.

=== Acacia ants and acacias ===

The acacia ant (&quot;Pseudomyrmex ferruginea&quot;) is an obligate plant ant that protects at least five species of &quot;Acacia&quot; (&quot;Vachellia&quot;) from preying insects and from other plants competing for sunlight, and the tree provides nourishment and shelter for the ant and its larvae.

=== Seed dispersal ===

Seed dispersal is the movement, spread or transport of seeds away from the parent plant. Plants have limited mobility and rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic vectors such as the wind and living (biotic) vectors like birds. In order to attract animals, these plants evolved a set of morphological characters such as fruit colour, mass, and persistence correlated to particular seed dispersal agents. For example, plants may evolve conspicuous fruit colours to attract avian frugivores, and birds may learn to associate such colours with a food resource.

<text>Cymbeline (), also known as The Tragedie of Cymbeline or Cymbeline, King of Britain, is a play by William Shakespeare set in Ancient Britain () and based on legends that formed part of the Matter of Britain concerning the early historical Celtic British King Cunobeline. Although it is listed as a tragedy in the First Folio, modern critics often classify &quot;Cymbeline&quot; as a romance or even a comedy. Like &quot;Othello&quot; and &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, it deals with the themes of innocence and jealousy. While the precise date of composition remains unknown, the play was certainly produced as early as 1611.

==Summary==
 Cymbeline is the Roman Empire&#x27;s vassal king of Britain. Twenty years earlier, Cymbeline&#x27;s two infant sons, Guiderius and Arvirargus, were kidnapped by an exiled traitor named Belarius. Cymbeline discovers his daughter, Imogen (or Innogen), has secretly married her lover Posthumus Leonatus, a member of Cymbeline&#x27;s court. The lovers have exchanged jewellery as tokens: Imogen with a bracelet, and Posthumus with a ring. Cymbeline dismisses the marriage and banishes Posthumus since Imogen—as Cymbeline&#x27;s only remaining child—must produce a fully royal-blooded heir to succeed to the British throne. In the meantime, Cymbeline&#x27;s Queen is conspiring to have Cloten (her cloddish and arrogant son by an earlier marriage) marry Imogen to secure her bloodline. The Queen is also plotting to murder both Imogen and Cymbeline, procuring what she believes is deadly poison from the court doctor. The doctor, Cornelius, is suspicious and switches the poison for a harmless sleeping potion. The Queen passes the &quot;poison&quot; along to Pisanio, Posthumus and Imogen&#x27;s loyal servant. Imogen is told it is a medicinal drug. Unable to be with Posthumus, Imogen secludes herself in her chambers, away from Cloten&#x27;s aggressive advances.

Posthumus must now live in Italy, where he meets Iachimo (or Giacomo), who wagers the prideful Posthumus that he, Iachimo, can seduce Imogen, whom Posthumus has praised for her chastity, and will then bring Posthumus proof of Imogen&#x27;s adultery. If Iachimo wins, he will get Posthumus&#x27;s token ring. If Posthumus wins, not only must Iachimo pay him but also fight Posthumus in a duel with swords. Iachimo heads to Britain where he attempts to seduce the faithful Imogen, who rejects him. Iachimo then hides in a chest in Imogen&#x27;s bedchamber and, when the princess falls asleep, steals Posthumus&#x27;s bracelet from her. He also takes note of the room, as well as the mole on Imogen&#x27;s partially nude body, to present as false evidence to Posthumus that he seduced his bride. Returning to Italy, Iachimo convinces Posthumus that he has successfully seduced Imogen. In his wrath, Posthumus sends two letters to Britain: one to Imogen, telling her to meet him at Milford Haven, on the Welsh coast; the other to the servant Pisanio, ordering him to murder Imogen at the Haven. However, Pisanio refuses and reveals Posthumus&#x27;s plot to Imogen. He has Imogen disguise herself as a boy and they continue to Milford Haven to seek employment. He also gives her the Queen&#x27;s &quot;poison&quot;, believing it will alleviate her psychological distress. In the guise of a boy, Imogen assumes the name &quot;Fidele&quot;, meaning &quot;faithful&quot;.

 Back at Cymbeline&#x27;s court, Cymbeline refuses to pay his British tribute to the Roman ambassador Caius Lucius. Lucius warns Cymbeline of the Roman Emperor&#x27;s forthcoming wrath, which will be an invasion of Britain by Roman troops. Meanwhile, Cloten learns of the &quot;meeting&quot; between Imogen and Posthumus at Milford Haven. Dressing himself in Posthumus&#x27;s clothes, he decides to go to Wales to kill Posthumus, and then rape, abduct, and marry Imogen. Imogen has now been travelling as Fidele through the Welsh mountains, her health in decline as she comes to a cave. It is the home of Belarius and his &quot;sons&quot; Polydore and Cadwal, whom he raised into great hunters. The two young men are the British princes Guiderius and Arviragus, who are unaware of their own origin. The men discover Fidele, and, instantly captivated by a strange affinity for &quot;him&quot;, become fast friends. Outside the cave, Guiderius is met by Cloten, who insults him, leading to a sword fight during which Guiderius beheads Cloten. Meanwhile, Imogen&#x27;s fragile state worsens and she takes the &quot;poison&quot; as a medicine; when the men re-enter, they find her &quot;dead.&quot; They mourn and, after placing Cloten&#x27;s body beside hers, briefly depart to prepare for the double burial. Imogen awakes to find the headless body, and believes it to be Posthumus because the body is wearing Posthumus&#x27;s clothes. Lucius&#x27; Roman soldiers have just arrived in Britain and, as the army moves through Wales, Lucius discovers the devastated Fidele, who pretends to be a loyal servant grieving his killed master; Lucius, moved by this faithfulness, enlists Fidele as a pageboy.

The treacherous Queen is now wasting away due to her son Cloten&#x27;s disappearance. Meanwhile, the guilt-ridden Posthumus enlists in the Roman forces as they invade Britain. Belarius, Guiderius, Arviragus, and Posthumus all help rescue Cymbeline from the Roman onslaught; the king does not yet recognise these four, yet takes notice of them as they fight bravely and capture the Roman commanders, Lucius and Iachimo, thus winning the day. Posthumus, allowing himself to be captured, as well as Fidele, are imprisoned alongside the true Romans, who all await execution. In jail, Posthumus sleeps, while the ghosts of his dead family appear to complain to Jupiter of his grim fate. Jupiter himself appears in thunder and glory to assure the others that destiny will grant happiness to Posthumus and Britain.

Cornelius arrives at court to announce the Queen&#x27;s sudden death, and that on her deathbed she unrepentantly confessed to villainous schemes against her husband and his throne. Both troubled and relieved by this news, Cymbeline prepares to execute his prisoners, but pauses when he sees Fidele, whom he finds both beautiful and familiar. Fidele has noticed Posthumus&#x27;s ring on Iachimo&#x27;s finger and demands to know how he obtained it. A remorseful Iachimo confesses about the wager he made, and how he tricked Posthumus into believing he had seduced Imogen. Posthumus then comes forward to confirm Iachimo&#x27;s story, revealing his identity and acknowledging his wrongfulness in wanting Imogen killed. Ecstatic, Imogen throws herself at Posthumus, who, believing she is a boy, knocks her down. Pisanio then rushes to explain that Fidele is Imogen. Imogen still suspects that Pisanio conspired with the Queen to poison her. Pisanio claims innocence, and Cornelius reveals the potion was harmless. Insisting that his betrayal years ago was a set-up, Belarius makes his own happy confession, revealing Guiderius and Arviragus as Cymbeline&#x27;s own two long-lost sons. With her brothers restored to the line of inheritance, Imogen is free to marry Posthumus. An elated Cymbeline pardons Belarius and the Roman prisoners, including Lucius and Iachimo. Lucius summons his soothsayer to decipher a prophecy of recent events, which ensures happiness for all. Blaming his manipulative Queen for his refusal to pay earlier, Cymbeline now agrees to pay the tribute to the Roman Emperor as a gesture of peace between Britain and Rome. Everyone is invited to a great feast.

== Sources ==
&quot;Cymbeline&quot; is grounded in the story of the historical British king Cunobeline, which was originally recorded in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, but which Shakespeare likely found in the 1587 edition of Raphael’s &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot;. Shakespeare based the setting of the play and the character Cymbeline on what he found in Holinshed&#x27;s chronicles, but the plot and subplots of the play are derived from other sources. The subplot of Posthumus and Iachimo&#x27;s wager derives from story II.9 of Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;The Decameron&quot; and the anonymously authored &quot;Frederyke of Jennen&quot;. These share similar characters and wager terms, and both feature Iachimo&#x27;s equivalent hiding in a chest in order to gather proof in Imogen&#x27;s room. Iachimo&#x27;s description of Imogen&#x27;s room as proof of her infidelity derives from &quot;The Decameron&quot;, and Pisanio&#x27;s reluctance to kill Imogen and his use of her bloody clothes to convince Posthumus of her death derive from &quot;Frederyke of Jennen.&quot; In both sources, the equivalent to Posthumus&#x27;s bracelet is stolen jewellery that the wife later recognises while cross-dressed. Shakespeare also drew inspiration for &quot;Cymbeline&quot; from a play called &quot;The Rare Triumphs of Love and Fortune,&quot; first performed in 1582. There are many parallels between the characters of the two plays, including a king&#x27;s daughter who falls for a man of unknown birth who grew up in the king&#x27;s court. The subplot of Belarius and the lost princes was inspired by the story of Bomelio, an exiled nobleman in &quot;The Rare Triumphs&quot; who is later revealed to be the protagonist&#x27;s father.

== Date and text ==
The first recorded production of &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, as noted by Simon Forman, was in April 1611. It was first published in the &quot;First Folio&quot; in 1623. When &quot;Cymbeline&quot; was actually written cannot be precisely dated.

The Yale edition suggests a collaborator had a hand in the authorship, and some scenes (e.g., Act III scene 7 and Act V scene 2) may strike the reader as particularly un-Shakespearean when compared with others. The play shares notable similarities in language, situation, and plot with Beaumont and Fletcher&#x27;s tragicomedy &quot;Philaster, or Love Lies a-Bleeding&quot; (). Both plays concern themselves with a princess who, after disobeying her father in order to marry a lowly lover, is wrongly accused of infidelity and thus ordered to be murdered, before escaping and having her faithfulness proven. Furthermore, both were written for the same theatre company and audience. Some scholars believe this supports a dating of approximately 1609, though it is not clear which play preceded the other.The editors of the Oxford and Norton Shakespeare believe the name of Imogen is a misprint for Innogen—they draw several comparisons between &quot;Cymbeline&quot; and &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, in early editions of which a ghost character named Innogen was supposed to be Leonato&#x27;s wife (Posthumus being also known as &quot;Leonatus&quot;, the Latin form of the Italian name in the other play). Stanley Wells and Michael Dobson point out that Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot;, which Shakespeare used as a source, mention an Innogen and that Forman&#x27;s eyewitness account of the April 1611 performance refers to &quot;Innogen&quot; throughout. In spite of these arguments, most editions of the play have continued to use the name Imogen.

Milford Haven is not known to have been used during the period (early 1st century AD) in which &quot;Cymbeline&quot; is set, and it is not known why Shakespeare used it in the play. Robert Nye noted that it was the closest seaport to Shakespeare&#x27;s home town of Stratford-upon-Avon: &quot;But if you marched due west from Stratford, looking neither to left nor to right, with the idea of running away to sea in your young head, then Milford Haven is the port you&#x27;d reach,&quot; a walk of about , about six days&#x27; journey, that the young Shakespeare might well have taken, or at least dreamed of taking.

Cull notes its possible symbolism as the landing site of Henry Tudor, when he invaded England via Milford on 7 August 1485 on his way to deposing Richard III and establishing the Tudor dynasty. It may also reflect English anxiety about the loyalty of the Welsh and the possibility of future invasions at Milford.

== Criticism and interpretation ==
&quot;Cymbeline&quot; was one of Shakespeare&#x27;s more popular plays during the eighteenth century, though critics including Samuel Johnson took issue with its complex plot:

William Hazlitt and John Keats, however, numbered it among their favourite plays.

By the early twentieth century, the play had lost favour. Lytton Strachey found it &quot;difficult to resist the conclusion that [Shakespeare] was getting bored himself. Bored with people, bored with real life, bored with drama, bored, in fact, with everything except poetry and poetical dreams.&quot;

In 1937, Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw wrote &quot;Cymbeline Refinished,&quot; that rewrites the final act of the play. Shaw commented on the play 1896, in one fiery critique stating it was:&quot;stagey trash of the lowest melodramatic order, in parts abominably written, throughout intellectually vulgar, and, judged in point of thought by modem intellectual standards, vulgar, foolish, offensive, indecent and exasperating beyond all tolerance.&quot;Shaw, however, would go on to reform his opinion of the play after his rewriting of the ending, yet he remained firmly of the opinion that the final act was disastrous, writing in 1946 that it was &quot;one of the finest of Shakespeare&#x27;s later plays&quot; but &quot;goes to pieces in the final act.&quot; Harley Granville-Barker, who found success as an actor in Shaw&#x27;s plays had similar views, saying that the play shows that Shakespeare was becoming a &quot;wearied artist&quot;.

Some have argued that the play parodies its own content. Harold Bloom wrote that &quot;&quot;Cymbeline&quot;, in my judgment, is partly a Shakespearean self-parody; many of his prior plays and characters are mocked by it.&quot;

=== British identity ===
Similarities between Cymbeline and historical accounts of the Roman Emperor Augustus have prompted critics to interpret the play as Shakespeare voicing support for the political notions of James I, who considered himself the &quot;British Augustus.&quot; His political manoeuvres to unite Scotland with England and Wales as an empire mirror Augustus&#x27; &quot;Pax Romana.&quot; The play reinforces the Jacobean idea that Britain is the successor to the civilised virtue of ancient Rome, portraying the parochialism and isolationism of Cloten and the Queen as villainous. Other critics have resisted the idea that &quot;Cymbeline&quot; endorses James I&#x27;s ideas about national identity, pointing to several characters&#x27; conflicted constructions of their geographic identities. For example, although Guiderius and Arviragus are the sons of Cymbeline, a British king raised in Rome, they grew up in a Welsh cave. The brothers lament their isolation from society, a quality associated with barbarousness, but Belarius, their adoptive father, retorts that this has spared them from corrupting influences of the supposedly civilised British court.

Iachimo&#x27;s invasion of Imogen&#x27;s bedchamber may reflect concern that Britain was being maligned by Italian influence. According to Peter A. Parolin, &quot;Cymbeline’s&quot; scenes ostensibly set in ancient Rome may be anachronistic portrayals of sixteenth-century Italy, which was characterised by contemporary British authors as a place where vice, debauchery, and treachery had supplanted the virtue of ancient Rome. Though &quot;Cymbeline&quot; concludes with a peace forged between Britain and Rome, Iachimo&#x27;s corruption of Posthumus and metaphorical rape of Imogen may demonstrate fears that Great Britain&#x27;s political union with other cultures might expose Britons to harmful foreign influences.

=== Gender and sexuality ===
Scholars have emphasised that the play attributes great political significance to Imogen&#x27;s virginity and chastity. There is some debate as to whether Imogen and Posthumus&#x27;s marriage is legitimate. Imogen has historically been played and received as an ideal, chaste woman maintaining qualities applauded in a patriarchal structure; however, critics argue that Imogen&#x27;s actions contradict these social definitions through her defiance of her father and her cross-dressing. Yet critics including Tracey Miller-Tomlinson have emphasised the ways in which the play upholds patriarchal ideology, including in the final scene, with its panoply of male victors. Whilst Imogen and Posthumus&#x27;s marriage at first upholds heterosexual norms, their separation and final reunion leave open non-heterosexual possibilities, initially exposed by Imogen&#x27;s cross-dressing as Fidele. Miller-Tomlinson points out the falseness of their social significance as a &quot;perfect example&quot; of a public &quot;heterosexual marriage&quot;, considering that their private relations turn out to be &quot;homosocial, homoerotic, and hermaphroditic.&quot;

Queer theory has gained traction in scholarship on &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, building upon the work of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Judith Butler. Scholarship on this topic has emphasised the play&#x27;s Ovidian allusions and exploration of non-normative gender/sexuality – achieved through separation from traditional society into what Valerie Traub terms &quot;green worlds.&quot; Amongst the most obvious and frequently cited examples of this non-normative dimension of the play is the prominence of homoeroticism, as seen in Guiderius and Arviragus&#x27;s semi-sexual fascination with the disguised Imogen/Fidele. In addition to homoerotic and homosocial elements, the subjects of hermaphroditism and paternity/maternity also feature prominently in queer interpretations of &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. Janet Adelman set the tone for the intersection of paternity and hermaphroditism in arguing that Cymbeline&#x27;s lines, &quot;oh, what am I, / A mother to the birth of three? Ne’er mother / Rejoiced deliverance more&quot;, amount a &quot;parthenogenesis fantasy&quot;. According to Adelman and Tracey Miller-Tomlinson, in taking sole credit for the creation of his children Cymbeline acts a hermaphrodite who transforms a maternal function into a patriarchal strategy by regaining control of his male heirs and daughter, Imogen. Imogen&#x27;s own experience with gender fluidity and cross-dressing has largely been interpreted through a patriarchal lens. Unlike other Shakespearean agents of onstage gender fluidity – Portia, Rosalind, Viola and Julia – Imogen is not afforded empowerment upon her transformation into Fidele. Instead, Imogen&#x27;s power is inherited from her father and based upon the prospect of reproduction.

== Performance history ==
After the 1611 performance mentioned by Simon Forman, there is no record of production until 1634, when the play was revived at court for Charles I and Henrietta Maria. The Caroline production was noted as being &quot;well likte by the kinge.&quot; In 1728 John Rich staged the play with his company at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, with emphasis placed on the spectacle of the production rather than the text of the play. Theophilus Cibber revived Shakespeare&#x27;s text in 1744 with a performance at the Haymarket. There is evidence that Cibber put on another performance in 1746, and another in 1758.

In 1761, David Garrick edited a new version of the text. It is recognized as being close to the original Shakespeare, although there are several differences. Changes included the shortening of Imogen&#x27;s burial scene and the entire fifth act, including the removal of Posthumus&#x27;s dream. Garrick&#x27;s text was first performed in November of that year, starring Garrick himself as Posthumus. Several scholars have indicated that Garrick&#x27;s Posthumus was much liked. Valerie Wayne notes that Garrick&#x27;s changes made the play more nationalistic, representing a trend in perception of &quot;Cymbeline&quot; during that period. Garrick&#x27;s version of &quot;Cymbeline&quot; would prove popular; it was staged a number of times over the next few decades.

In the late eighteenth century, Cymbeline was performed in Jamaica.

The play entered the Romantic era with John Philip Kemble&#x27;s company in 1801. Kemble&#x27;s productions made use of lavish spectacle and scenery; one critic noted that during the bedroom scene, the bed was so large that Iachimo all but needed a ladder to view Imogen in her sleep. Kemble added a dance to Cloten&#x27;s comic wooing of Imogen. In 1827, his brother Charles mounted an antiquarian production at Covent Garden; it featured costumes designed after the descriptions of the ancient British by such writers as Julius Caesar and Diodorus Siculus.

William Charles Macready mounted the play several times between 1837 and 1842. At the Theatre Royal, Marylebone, an epicene production was staged with Mary Warner, Fanny Vining, Anna Cora Mowatt, and Edward Loomis Davenport.

In 1859, &quot;Cymbeline&quot; was first performed in Sri Lanka. In the late nineteenth century, the play was produced several times in India.

In 1864, as part of the celebrations of Shakespeare&#x27;s birth, Samuel Phelps performed the title role at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Helena Faucit returned to the stage for this performance.

The play was also one of Ellen Terry&#x27;s last performances with Henry Irving at the Lyceum in 1896. Terry&#x27;s performance was widely praised, though Irving was judged an indifferent Iachimo. Like Garrick, Irving removed the dream of Posthumus; he also curtailed Iachimo&#x27;s remorse and attempted to render Cloten&#x27;s character consistent. A review in the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; compared this trimmed version to pastoral comedies such as &quot;As You Like It&quot;. The set design, overseen by Lawrence Alma-Tadema, was lavish and advertised as historically accurate, though the reviewer for the time complained of such anachronisms as gold crowns and printed books as props.

Similarly lavish but less successful was Margaret Mather&#x27;s production in New York in 1897. The sets and publicity cost $40,000, but Mather was judged too emotional and undisciplined to succeed in a fairly cerebral role.

Barry Jackson staged a modern dress production for the Birmingham Rep in 1923, two years before his influential modern dress &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Walter Nugent Monck brought his Maddermarket Theatre production to Stratford in 1946, inaugurating the post-war tradition of the play.

London saw two productions in the 1956 season. Michael Benthall directed the less successful production, at The Old Vic. The set design by Audrey Cruddas was notably minimal, with only a few essential props. She relied instead on a variety of lighting effects to reinforce mood; actors seemed to come out of darkness and return to darkness. Barbara Jefford was criticised as too cold and formal for Imogen; Leon Gluckman played Posthumus, Derek Godfrey Iachimo, and Derek Francis Cymbeline. Following Victorian practice, Benthall drastically shortened the last act.

By contrast, Peter Hall&#x27;s production at the Shakespeare Memorial presented nearly the entire play, including the long-neglected dream scene (although a golden eagle designed for Jupiter turned out too heavy for the stage machinery and was not used). Hall presented the play as a distant fairy tale, with stylised performances. The production received favourable reviews, both for Hall&#x27;s conception and, especially, for Peggy Ashcroft&#x27;s Imogen. Richard Johnson played Posthumus, and Robert Harris Cymbeline. Iachimo was played by Geoffrey Keen, whose father Malcolm had played Iachimo with Ashcroft at the Old Vic in 1932.

Hall&#x27;s approach attempted to unify the play&#x27;s diversity by means of a fairy-tale topos. The next major Royal Shakespeare Company production, in 1962, went in the opposite direction. Working on a set draped with heavy white sheets, director William Gaskill employed Brechtian alienation effects, to mixed critical reviews. The acting, however, was widely praised. Vanessa Redgrave as Imogen was often compared favourably to Ashcroft; Eric Porter was a success as Iachimo, as was Clive Swift as Cloten. Patrick Allen was Posthumus, and Tom Fleming played the title role.

A decade later, John Barton&#x27;s 1974 production for the RSC (with assistance from Clifford Williams) featured Sebastian Shaw in the title role, Tim Pigott-Smith as Posthumus, Ian Richardson as Iachimo, and Susan Fleetwood as Imogen. Charles Keating was Cloten. As with contemporary productions of &quot;Pericles&quot;, this one used a narrator (Cornelius) to signal changes in mood and treatment to the audience. Robert Speaight disliked the set design, which he called too minimal, but he approved the acting.

In 1980, David Jones revived the play for the RSC; the production was in general a disappointment, although Judi Dench as Imogen received reviews that rivalled Ashcroft&#x27;s. Ben Kingsley played Iachimo; Roger Rees was Posthumus. In 1987, Bill Alexander directed the play in The Other Place (later transferring to the Pit in London&#x27;s Barbican Centre) with Harriet Walter playing Imogen, David Bradley as Cymbeline and Nicholas Farrell as Posthumus.

At the Stratford Festival, the play was directed in 1970 by Jean Gascon and in 1987 by Robin Phillips. The latter production, which was marked by much-approved scenic complexity, featured Colm Feore as Iachimo, and Martha Burns as Imogen. The play was again at Stratford in 2004, directed by David Latham. A large medieval tapestry unified the fairly simple stage design and underscored Latham&#x27;s fairy-tale inspired direction.

In 1994, Ajay Chowdhury directed an Anglo-Indian production of &quot;Cymbeline&quot; at the Rented Space Theatre Company. Set in India under British rule, the play features Iachimo, played by Rohan Kenworthy, as a British soldier and Imogen, played by Uzma Hameed, as an Indian princess.

At the new Globe Theatre in 2001, a cast of six (including Abigail Thaw, Mark Rylance, and Richard Hope) used extensive doubling for the play. The cast wore identical costumes even when in disguise, allowing for particular comic effects related to doubling (as when Cloten attempts to disguise himself as Posthumus.)

There have been some well-received theatrical productions including the Public Theater&#x27;s 1998 production in New York City, directed by Andrei Șerban. &quot;Cymbeline&quot; was also performed at the Cambridge Arts Theatre in October 2007 in a production directed by Sir Trevor Nunn, and in November 2007 at the Chicago Shakespeare Theatre. The play was included in the 2013 repertory season of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.

In 2004 and 2014, the Hudson Shakespeare Company of New Jersey produced two distinct versions of the play. The 2004 production, directed by Jon Ciccarelli, embraced the fairy tale aspect of the story and produced a colourful version with wicked step-mothers, feisty princesses and a campy Iachimo. The 2014 version, directed by Rachel Alt, went in a completely opposite direction and placed the action on ranch in the American Old West. The Queen was a southern belle married to a rancher, with Imogen as a high society girl in love with the cowhand Posthumous.

In a 2007 Cheek by Jowl production, Tom Hiddleston doubled as Posthumus and Cloten.

In 2011, the Shakespeare Theatre Company of Washington, DC, presented a version of the play that emphasised its fable and folklore elements, set as a tale within a tale, as told to a child.

In 2012, Antoni Cimolino directed a production at the Stratford Festival that steered into the fairy-tale elements of the text.

Also in 2012, the South Sudan Theatre Company staged &quot;Cymbeline&quot; in Juba Arabic for the Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe &quot;Globe to Globe&quot; festival. It was translated by Derik Uya Alfred and directed by Joseph Abuk. Connections between the content of the play and South Sudan&#x27;s own political struggle have been drawn by the production&#x27;s producers, as well as some scholars. Overall, the production was well received by audiences and critics. Critic Matt Truman gave the production four out of five stars, saying &quot;The world&#x27;s youngest nation seems delighted to be here and, played with this much heart, even Shakespeare&#x27;s most rambling romance becomes irresistible.&quot;

In 2013, Samir Bhamra directed the play for Phizzical Productions with six actors playing multiple parts for a UK national tour. The cast included Sophie Khan Levy as Innojaan, Adam Youssefbeygi, Tony Hasnath, Liz Jadav and Robby Khela. The production was set in the souks of Dubai and the Bollywood film industry during the 1990s communal riots and received acclaim from reviewers and academics alike.

Also in 2013, a folk musical adaptation of &quot;Cymbeline&quot; was performed at the First Folio Theatre in Oak Brook, Illinois. The setting was the American South during the Civil War, with Cymbeline as a man of high status who avoids military service. The play was performed outdoors and was accompanied by traditional Appalachian folk songs.

In 2015, at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe in the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, a production was directed by Sam Yates where the role of Innogen was played by Emily Barber and Jonjo O&#x27;Neill as Posthumus.

In 2016, Melly Still directed &quot;Cymbeline&quot; at the Royal Shakespeare Company. This version of the play was performed at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre before moving to the Barbican in late 2016. The performance featured Bethan Cullinane as Innogen and Gillian Bevan as Cymbeline.

In 2023, Gregory Doran directed &quot;Cymbeline&quot; at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. It was his final production as artistic director, and received largely positive reviews. The cast included Peter De Jersey as Cymbeline and Amber James as Imogen.

Also in 2023, San Francisco&#x27;s Free Shakespeare in the Park performed &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, directed by Maryssa Wanlass, with a David Bowie/fantasy-themed focus on the play&#x27;s queer interpretations.

In 2024, at the Stratford Festival, &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, directed by Esther Jun, reversed the gender of several roles, with Cymbeline portrayed as Queen of Britain by Lucy Peacock and her husband as a Duke, played by Rick Roberts. Innogen was played by Allison Edwards-Crewe.

== Adaptations ==

The play was adapted by Thomas d&#x27;Urfey as &quot;The Injured Princess, or, the Fatal Wager&quot;; this version was produced at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, presumably by the united King&#x27;s Company and Duke&#x27;s Company, in 1682. The play changes some names and details, and adds a subplot, typical of the Restoration, in which a virtuous waiting-woman escapes the traps laid by Cloten. D&#x27;Urfey also changes Pisanio&#x27;s character so that he at once believes in Imogen&#x27;s (Eugenia, in D&#x27;Urfey&#x27;s play) guilt. For his part, D&#x27;Urfey&#x27;s Posthumus is ready to accept that his wife might have been untrue, as she is young and beautiful. Some details of this alteration survived in productions at least until the middle of the century.

William Hawkins revised the play again in 1759. His was among the last of the heavy revisions designed to bring the play in line with classical unities. He cut the Queen, reduced the action to two places (the court and a forest in Wales). The dirge &quot;With fairest flowers...&quot; was set to music by Thomas Arne.

Nearer the end of the century, Henry Brooke wrote an adaptation which was apparently never staged. His version eliminates the brothers altogether as part of a notable enhancement of Posthumus&#x27;s role in the play.

George Bernard Shaw, who criticized the play perhaps more harshly than he did any of Shakespeare&#x27;s other works, took aim at what he saw as the defects of the final act in his 1937 &quot;Cymbeline Refinished&quot;; as early as 1896, he had complained about the absurdities of the play to Ellen Terry, then preparing to act Imogen. He called it &quot;stagey trash of the lowest melodramatic order&quot;. He later changed his view, saying it was &quot;one of the finest of Shakespeare&#x27;s later plays&quot;, but he remained convinced that it &quot;goes to pieces in the final act&quot;. Accordingly, in &quot;Cymbeline Refinished&quot; he rewrote the last act, cutting many of the numerous revelations and expositions, while also making Imogen a much more assertive figure in line with his feminist views.

There have been a number of radio adaptations of &quot;Cymbeline&quot; between the 1930s and the 2000s. The BBC broadcast productions of &quot;Cymbeline&quot; in the United Kingdom in 1934, 1951, 1957, 1986, 1996, and 2006. NBC broadcast a production of the play in the United States in 1938. In October 1951 the BBC aired a production of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Cymbeline Refinished&quot;, as well as Shaw&#x27;s foreword to the play.

=== Screen adaptations ===
Lucius J. Henderson directed the first screen adaptation of &quot;Cymbeline&quot; in 1913. The film was produced by the Thanhouser Company and starred Florence La Badie as Imogen, James Cruze as Posthumus, William Garwood as Iachimo, William Russell as Cymbeline, and Jean Darnell as the Queen.

In 1937 the BBC broadcast several scenes of André van Gyseghem&#x27;s production of the play, which opened 16 November the same year, on television. The scenes that comprised the broadcast were pulled exclusively from Acts I and II of the play, and included the &#x27;trunk scene&#x27; from Act II Scene 2. In 1956 the BBC produced a similar television program, this time airing scenes from Michael Benthall&#x27;s theatrical production, which opened 11 September 1956. Like the 1937 program, the 1956 broadcast ran for roughly half an hour and presented several scenes from &quot;Cymbeline,&quot; including the trunk scene.

In 1968 Jerzy Jarocki directed an adaptation of the play for Polish television, starring Wiktor Sadecki as Cymbeline and Ewa Lassek as Imogen.

Elijah Moshinsky directed the BBC Television Shakespeare adaptation in 1982, ignoring the ancient British period setting in favour of a more timeless and snow-laden atmosphere inspired by Rembrandt and his contemporary Dutch painters. Richard Johnson, Claire Bloom, Helen Mirren, and Robert Lindsay play Cymbeline, his Queen, Imogen, and Iachimo, respectively, with Michael Pennington as Posthumus.

In 2014, Ethan Hawke and director Michael Almereyda, who previously collaborated on the 2000 film &quot;Hamlet&quot;, re-teamed for the film &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, in which Hawke plays Iachimo. The film is set in the context of urban gang warfare. Ed Harris takes the title role. Penn Badgley plays the orphan Posthumus; Milla Jovovich plays the role of the Queen; Anton Yelchin is Cloten; and Dakota Johnson plays the role of Imogen.

==Stage adaptions==

Prior to operatic adaptations only incidental music was composed. The first operatic adaption seems to be composed by Edmond Missa in 1894, under the title &quot;Dinah&quot;; American composer Christopher Berg composed another one, of which scenes were performed in 2009.

== Cultural references ==
In Beethoven’s one opera Fidelio, the loyal wife Leonore, disguising herself as a man, takes on the name Fidelio, as a probable reference to Imogen’s cross-dressing as Fidele.
The &#x27;Song&#x27; from Act II, Scene 3 &quot;(Hark, hark! the lark)&quot; was set to music by Franz Schubert in 1826.

Perhaps the most famous verses in the play come from the funeral song of Act IV, Scene 2, which begins:
:Fear no more the heat o&#x27; the sun,
:Nor the furious winter&#x27;s rages;
:Thou thy worldly task hast done,
:Home art gone, and ta&#x27;en thy wages:
:Golden lads and girls all must,
:As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.

The first two lines are quoted by Virginia Woolf in &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; by the two main characters Clarissa and Septimus Smith. The lines, which turn Mrs. Dalloway&#x27;s thoughts to the trauma of the First World War, are at once an elegiac dirge and a profoundly dignified declaration of endurance. The song provides a major organisational motif for the novel. The final couplet also appears in the Anton Myrer novel, &quot;The Last Convertible&quot;.

The last two lines appear to have inspired T. S. Eliot in &quot;Lines to a Yorkshire Terrier&quot; (in &quot;Five-Finger Exercises&quot;). He writes:

:Pollicle dogs and cats all must
:Jellicle cats and dogs all must
:Like undertakers, come to dust.

The song was set to music by Roger Quilter as &quot;Fear No More the Heat o&#x27; the Sun,&quot; No. 1 of Five Shakespeare Songs, Op. 23 (1921). It was also set by Gerald Finzi as part of his song cycle on texts by Shakespeare &quot;Let Us Garlands Bring&quot; (1942). The text is sung by Cleo Laine to music by John Dankworth on her 1964 album &quot;Shakespeare and All That Jazz&quot;.

At the end of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;The Frogs&quot;, William Shakespeare is competing against George Bernard Shaw for the title of best playwright, deciding which of them is to be brought back from the dead in order to improve the world. Shakespeare sings the funeral song of Act IV, Scene 2, when asked about his view of death (the song is titled &quot;Fear No More&quot;).

&quot;Fear no more the heat of the sun&quot; is the line that Winnie and her husband are trying to remember in Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Happy Days&quot; as they sit exposed to the elements.

In the Epilogue of the novel &quot;Appointment with Death&quot; by Agatha Christie, the first four lines of the verse are quoted by the character Ginevra Boynton as she reflects on the life of her deceased mother Mrs Boynton.

In &quot;The Scent of Water&quot; (1963) by Elizabeth Goudge, the central character, Mary Lindsay, feels struck by lightning when she realises she has fallen in love with Paul Randall, an author and Royal Air Force pilot, blinded in the last days of World War II, and married. &quot;Fear no more the lightning-flash&quot;, Mary suddenly thinks, along with the rest of that stanza, ending &quot;All lovers young, all lovers must /Consign to thee, and come to dust&quot;, knowing she must hide her love, and recognising that, already fifty, she is growing old (Chapter IX, Part 1, p 164).

<text>The late romances, often simply called the romances, are a grouping of William Shakespeare&#x27;s last plays, comprising &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot;; &quot;Cymbeline&quot;; &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;; and &quot;The Tempest&quot;. &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot;, of which Shakespeare was co-author, is sometimes also included in the grouping. The term &quot;romances&quot; was first used for these late works in Edward Dowden&#x27;s &quot;Shakspere&quot; (1877). Later writers have generally been content to adopt Dowden&#x27;s term.

Shakespeare&#x27;s plays cannot be precisely dated, but it is generally agreed that these comedies followed a series of tragedies including &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Shakespeare wrote tragedies because their productions were financially successful, but he returned to comedy towards the end of his career, mixing it with tragic and mystical elements. Shakespeare&#x27;s late romances were also influenced by the development of tragicomedy and the extreme elaboration of the courtly masque as staged by Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones. The subjects and style of these plays were also influenced by the preference of the monarch, by Shakespeare&#x27;s ageing company and by their more upper class audiences.

The romances call for spectacular effects to be shown onstage, including storms at sea, opulent interior and exterior scenery, dream settings and the illusion of time passing. Scholars have argued that the late plays deal with faith and redemption, and are variations on themes of rewarding virtue over vice.

==Plays==
Shakespeare&#x27;s late romances are:
* &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre,&quot; ca. 1603–08
* &quot;Cymbeline,&quot; ca. 1608–10
* &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale,&quot; ca. 1609–11
* &quot;The Tempest,&quot; ca. 1603–11
* &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen,&quot; ca. 1612–14 (co-written with John Fletcher)
::Sources: F E Halliday (1964), A L Rowse (1978) and Stanley Wells (1986)

The Norton Shakespeare describes &quot;Henry VIII&quot; (ca. 1612–13) as being characteristic of the late romances, but still considers it one of the histories, as does Rowse.

==Labelling and structure==

The category of Shakespearean romance arises from a desire among critics for the late plays to be recognised as a more complex kind of comedy; the labels of romance and tragicomedy are preferred by the majority of modern critics and editors. In the First Folio of 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, its editors, listed &quot;The Tempest&quot; and &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; as comedies, and &quot;Cymbeline&quot; as a tragedy. &quot;Pericles&quot; did not appear in it at all. In 1875, when Dowden argued that Shakespeare&#x27;s late comedies should be called &quot;romances&quot;, he did so because they resemble late medieval and early modern &quot;romances&quot;, a genre in which stories were set across the immensity of space and time. The romances have grand plot points which are combined with humour, dramatic action and internal struggles. They also feature broader characters, larger spectacles and a different handling of the themes of appearance and reality. The late romances differed from early Shakespearean comedies by relying on grand themes, rather than specific moments. The romances are Shakespearean tragedies that end happily, instead of a moment of danger that moves rapidly to a solution. They also focus on the relationships between father and daughter.

==Defining characteristics==
The final plays share some common traits:
* Tragic or potentially tragic elements at the beginning of the play that are then resolved by the end, such as Leontes&#x27;s jealousy in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale,&quot; or the shipwreck and drownings in &quot;The Tempest&quot;;
* Older men are more prominently featured;
* Young lovers are a part of each play, but are not central to the plot;
* A redemptive plotline with a happy ending reuniting long-separated family members;
* Magic and other fantastical elements;
* The presence of pre-Christian, masque-like figures, like Jupiter in &quot;Cymbeline&quot; and the goddesses whom Prospero summons in &quot;The Tempest&quot;;
* A mixture of &quot;courtly&quot; and &quot;pastoral&quot; scenes (such as the gentry and the island residents in &quot;The Tempest&quot; and the pastoral and courtly contrasts of &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;).

==Tragicomic influence==
Shakespeare&#x27;s romances were also influenced by two major developments in theatre in the early years of the seventeenth century. The first was the innovation of tragicomedy initiated by John Fletcher and developed in the early Beaumont and Fletcher collaborations. Tragicomedies made a pretence at &quot;grave stuff&quot; but invariably provided a happy ending with light entertainment. Shakespeare&#x27;s romances are more sharply tragicomic than his comedies: threats of death and scenes of suffering are more acute. Encounters with the supernatural are also more direct and emphatic. The other influence was the extreme elaboration of the courtly masque being stage in the same period by Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones. Key scenes in the late romances are closely related to court masques: They embrace the visual magnificence but also the shallowness of such a display.

==History==
The popular drama during the Renaissance was subject to external influences, specifically what the ruler wanted to see. Elizabeth I enjoyed watching what the people liked, which were the tragedies. Elizabeth reigned until her death in 1603. James I succeeded her, and he preferred the romances.

Shakespeare&#x27;s health was impaired, and he died about five years after &quot;The Tempest&quot;, the last play he wrote by himself. The shift indicates that he was giving up composition. He retired to Stratford following completion of his final play. The scholar Catherine Alexander has suggested that the plays were not specifically autobiographical in respect of Shakespeare&#x27;s advancing old age, but reflected the fact that the actors themselves were older. The King&#x27;s Men occupied a second playhouse, the Blackfriars, which had been out of use for several years. The playhouse had been shut down because of objections by local residents, but was reopened during the second half of 1608. In the interim the actors had aged, and Shakespeare adjusted the age of his characters.

The King&#x27;s Men were allowed to change their name from the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men in 1603, when James I came to the throne. They would put on as many as two new plays a week. Many plays had only a few performances, and there was no director: actors were expected to know fairly standard blocking patterns.
 Audiences at the Blackfriars were generally upper class, as the cost of admission was so high that the lower classes were unlikely to attend many performances. Because of the sophistication of the audience, the romances leaned more toward aesthetics and culture.

==Performances==

The romances create challenges for directors, as they require spectacular effects to be shown onstage. For &quot;Pericles,&quot; in 1854, Samuel Phelps created the effect of a storm by using rowers manning oars to carry Pericles from one location to another while a panorama moved behind them to create the illusion of travel. &quot;Cymbeline&quot; often offers two different directions for staging: grand and simple. In the spring of 1896, Henry Irving staged the play at the Lyceum Theatre, London with elaborate Celtic sets for Cymbeline&#x27;s palace gardens and interior rooms, a Roman banqueting hall for Posthumus&#x27;s visit to Rome, a handsomely decorated bedchamber for Imogen, and a spectacular dream setting for the descent of Jupiter. Ben Greet at The Old Vic in 1918, on the other hand, chose a simple, Elizabethan approach. &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; poses the challenges of time passing and a bear pursuing Antigonus off stage. In 1976, Trevor Nunn and John Barton cast John Nettles as both Time and the bear. At Stratford-upon-Avon in 1986, Terry Hands used a bearskin rug, which rose off the ground to chase Antigonus off.

&quot;The Tempest&quot; opens with a scene inspired by the shipwreck of &quot;Sea Venture&quot; in 1609. This scene has allowed for different stagings, from William Charles Macready in 1842 at Covent Garden featuring a huge sea vessel, fully rigged and manned, to Robert Falls&#x27;s production at the Goodman Theatre in 1987, where the scene was set on a cruiseship, with tourist passengers in deck chairs or playing shuffleboard until disaster struck.

==Criticism==
Because of the shift in style, as well as Shakespeare&#x27;s physical state, there has been much debate about why the late plays were written as they were. Dowden created a biographical view that suggested that Shakespeare was suffering from depression when he wrote his tragedies, and had worked his way out of it to create the romances. SirEdmund Chambers suggested that he suffered a breakdown while writing &quot;Timon of Athens,&quot; and the romances reflect a kind of psychological convalescence. Clifford Leech viewed the romances as infected with a kind of fantastical puritanism that came from Shakespeare&#x27;s personal revulsion from sex. D G James believed that Shakespeare ran out of poetic energy as he got older. Raphael Lyne comments that it is impossible to show that Shakespeare managed his career to this extent, and there is no pressing need to consider these works as anything other than coincidentally &quot;late&quot;. There is a belief among some scholars that the late plays deal with faith and redemption, and are variations on themes of rewarding virtue over vice.

G. Wilson Knight was among those critics to argue that the late romances embody, together with the high tragedies or even above them, Shakespeare&#x27;s greatest achievement. Harold Bloom says of &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; that in it Shakespeare returns to his full talent and genius with full force.

==Film adaptations==
A film version of &quot;Cymbeline&quot; was released in 2014, starring Milla Jovovich, Ethan Hawke, Penn Badgley, John Leguizamo and Ed Harris.

&quot;The Tempest&quot; has been adapted most often. A silent film version was made in 1908. Later adaptations include, &quot;Yellow Sky&quot; (1948) – set in the wild west, with Gregory Peck and Anne Baxter; &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; (1956) – a science fiction classic set in outer space; Derek Jarman&#x27;s 1979 version relocated to a crumbling mansion off the Scottish coast; &quot;Tempest&quot; (1982) – set on a Greek isle, with John Cassavetes, Molly Ringwald, Gena Rowlands and Susan Sarandon; &quot;Prospero&#x27;s Books&quot; (1991) starring John Gielgud – which is not so much an adaptation as a reading of the play, combining film, dance, opera, and animation; and a 2010 version with Prospero recast as Prospera, played by Helen Mirren.

<text>The [[cross-country skiing (sport)|cross-country skiing]] events at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] were marred by drug problems. The winners of three races were disqualified after blood tests showed that three skiers had overly high red blood cell counts indicating the use of darbepoetin, a drug used to treat anemia. At the time, the drug was not specifically listed in the International Olympic Committee&#x27;s (IOC) list of banned substances, but the Olympic rules generally prohibit doping of any kind, in accordance with its charter. After two years and several lawsuits in Olympic and Swiss courts, the skiers in question (Johann Mühlegg of Spain, and Larissa Lazutina and Olga Danilova of Russia) were stripped of all their medals from the 2002 Games.

See the external links below for the official IOC press releases containing detailed information of the doping cases and their resolution, including initial, intermediate, and final amended results. This article gives the final medalists as decided on by the IOC in early 2004.

===Men===
:Medals awarded Thursday, February 14, 2002

Yagudin received 5.9s and 6.0s for his free skating after World Champion Plushenko had made several errors in both the short program and the free skating.

* Sally-Anne Stapleford

Assistant Referee:

===Ladies===
:Medals awarded Thursday, February 21, 2002
16-year-old Hughes, fourth after the short program, skated a clean free skating with seven triple jumps, including two triple-triple combinations. Kwan led after the short program but slipped to third after two jumping errors. Sasha Cohen finished fourth, after a fall on the back end of a triple lutz-triple toe combination. Slutskaya became only the second Russian to medal in the ladies&#x27; event at the Olympics.

Hughes and Slutskaya finished with tie scores, Hughes winning the gold medal on a tiebreaker for having won the free skating. The Russian officials were very disappointed with the result and filed a protest, which was not accepted by ISU after it examined all results and scores, thus confirming Hughes as the winner.

During competition, the pairwise ranked choice voting system that the International Skating Union (ISU) had adopted after a debacle during the ladies&#x27; competition at the 1995 world championships caused a similar change in the scoring. Kwan, whose routine had triggered the 1995 incident, had been ahead of Hughes until Slutskaya skated. The judges&#x27; revised rankings put Hughes ahead of Kwan, an undesired effect of the independent irrelevant alternative. Two years later the ISU changed the voting procedures again to range voting.

===Pairs===
:Medals awarded February 11, 2002; second award ceremony February 17.

A controversial decision was taken which extended the Russian dominance of pair skating at the Olympics.

In the first week of the Games, a controversy in the pairs&#x27; figure skating competition culminated in the French judge&#x27;s scores being thrown out and the Canadian team of Jamie Salé and David Pelletier being awarded a gold medal (together with the Russians who were controversially awarded gold previously and kept their medals despite the allegations of vote swapping and buying the votes of the French judge). Allegations of bribery were leveled against many ice-skating judges, leading to the arrest of known criminal Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov in Italy (at the request of the United States). He was released by the Italian officials.

Judges from Russia, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Poland, Ukraine, and France placed the Russians first; judges from the United States, Canada, Germany, and Japan gave the nod to the Canadians. The International Skating Union announced a day after the competition that it would conduct an &quot;internal assessment&quot; into the judging decision. On February 15 the ISU and IOC, in a joint press conference, announced that Marie-Reine Le Gougne, the French judge implicated in collusion, was guilty of misconduct and was suspended effective immediately.

===Ice dance===

<text>Four [[freestyle skiing]] events were held at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, at the venue in Deer Valley. There were both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s competition in both &quot;aerials&quot; and &quot;moguls&quot; events. In moguls, the athletes ski down a slope littered with moguls (bumps), attempting to get down in as fast a time as possible while also attempting to get points for technique and their two aerial jumps during the course. The aerials events consisted of two jumps, which were judged by air, form and landing.

<doc id="39648" wikidata="Q16777463" url="?curid=39648" title="New England Digital">
<text>New England Digital Corporation (1976–1993) was founded in Norwich, Vermont, and relocated to White River Junction, Vermont. It was best known for its signature product, the Synclavier Synthesizer System, which evolved into the Synclavier Digital Audio System or &quot;Tapeless Studio.&quot; The company sold an FM digital synthesizer/16-bit polyphonic synthesizer and magnetic disk-based non-linear 16-bit digital recording product, referred to as the &quot;Post-Pro.&quot; 
The Synclavier was developed as the &quot;Dartmouth Digital Synthesizer&quot; by Dartmouth College Professors Jon Appleton and Frederick J. Hooven, in association with NED co-founders Sydney A. Alonso and Cameron W. Jones. The Synclavier would become the pioneering prototype hardware and software system for all digital non-linear synthesis, polyphonic sampling, magnetic (hard-disk) recording and sequencing systems technology that is commonplace in all music and sound effects/design today.

The instrument&#x27;s development picked up speed in late 1978/early 1979, when master synthesist, sound designer, and musical arranger, Denny Jaeger, began working with NED to help create system upgrades, advanced capabilities, and unique sounds that were tailored to fit the needs of the product for the commercial music industry. The second generation&#x27;s user interface panel and overall music design features of the original Synclavier (that would become Synclavier II) were substantially driven and designed by Denny Jaeger. His relentless attention to detail and unparalleled understanding of synthesis, audio recording, and technology provided tremendous product/market insight to the original founding hardware and software engineering team of Alonso and Jones. 

In November 1979, immediately following the arrival of Denny Jaeger, Alonso hired Brad Naples as the company&#x27;s Business Manager. Working in tandem, Jaeger and Naples were the main drivers of the marketing and sales/business development efforts of the company. However, all four individuals—Alonso, Jones, Jaeger, and Naples—worked as a collaborative team, which was quite unique and unparalleled at the time. NED unveiled the newly improved Synclavier II at the AES show in May 1980, where it became an instant hit.

In 1981 New England Digital pioneered the recording of digital audio to hard disk with the introduction of their Sample-To-Disk option. Their software module known as SFM (Signal File Manager) was popular among the academic world for research and analysis of audio. The SFM also found use in the US Military for the analysis of submarine sounds.

The company continued to refine the Synclavier II, with Jaeger leading more musician-friendly, technological improvements, and Naples evolving to become the company&#x27;s President/CEO (1983–1993) to assist Alonso and Jones, who were substantially expanding the hardware and software team. Musicians such as New York City-based multi-instrumentalist Kashif were involved in the creative development of Synclavier.

It became one of the most advanced electronic synthesis and recording tools of the day. Early adopters included:

* John McLaughlin
* Pat Metheny
* Michael Jackson, particularly on his 1982 album &quot;Thriller&quot;.
* Denny Jaeger and Michel Rubini, the first to use the Synclavier to score a major motion picture (&quot;The Hunger&quot;, with David Bowie, released through MGM in April, 1983) and to score the first network TV series (&quot;The Powers of Matthew Starr&quot;, from Paramount Television, released September, 1982).
* Laurie Anderson, whose 1984 album &quot;Mister Heartbreak&quot; includes visual depictions of Synclavier sound waves in the liner notes
* Frank Zappa, who composed his 1986 Grammy-winning album &quot;Jazz from Hell&quot; on the instrument. He continued to use it on his studio albums until his death in 1993, culminating in the posthumous release of his magnum opus &quot;Civilization, Phaze III&quot; (by Zappa&#x27;s estimation, 70% of this two-hour work is &quot;exclusively&quot; Synclavier.)
* Producer Mike Thorne, who used the Synclavier to shape the sound of the 80s producing bands such as Siouxsie and The Banshees, Soft Cell, Marc Almond, and Bronski Beat
* Record label founder Daniel Miller (Mute Records). It found use on most Depeche Mode albums in which band member Alan Wilder was involved.
* Sting
* Genesis
* The Cars
* Herbie Hancock
* Sean Callery
* Eddie Jobson

The system was nearly as famous for where it was &quot;not&quot; used, as it was for the list of premier studios in which it was: the extremely sophisticated synthesizer enjoyed the distinction of being banned from many famous concert halls, out of fear that it would make the musicians themselves obsolete. A notable exception being the massive, 55 minute Dialogue for Synclavier and Orchestra by American Composer Frank Proto, commissioned and performed by the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in 1986. Bringing together the full forces of a contemporary orchestra with a fully decked out Synclavier in a live performance, it displayed what can be achieved, combining both seemingly incompatible disciplines, by a composer with intimate knowledge of not only the available orchestral and electronic forces, but with the compositional skills to take advantage of both, without resorting to gimmicky devices frequently found in attempts to wed the two. 

The mature Synclavier was a modular, component-based system that included facilities for FM-based synthesis, digital sampling, hard-disk recording, and sophisticated computer-based sound editing. By the late 1980s, complete Synclavier systems were selling for upwards of $200,000, to famous musicians such as Sting, Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder, and to major studios the world over. The Synclavier was also employed by experimental musicians, such as John McLaughlin, Kraftwerk, Laurie Anderson, Frank Zappa, Kashif and Peter Buffett who used it extensively in their music. It is still used to this day in major movies for sound design, along with TV, Commercials and Music composition and production.

The Synclavier became a victim of the early 1990s economic downturn, the high prices (due in part to high specs, failure to diversify, and high executive salaries) and the rapidly increasing capabilities of personal computers, MIDI-enabled synthesizers and low-cost digital samplers. In the span of two years, the company saw enormous sales evaporate, and in 1992 they closed their doors forever. Parts of the company were purchased by Fostex, which used the technical knowledge base of staff to build several hard-disk recording systems in the 1990s (like Fostex Foundation 2000 and 2000re), and AirWorks Media, a Canadian company who used portions of code in their TuneBuilder product line. Simultaneously, a group of ex-employees and product owners collaborated to form The Synclavier Company, primarily as a maintenance organization for existing customers, but with an eye to adapting Synclavier software for stand-alone personal computer use, while in Europe the previously profitable, but now motherless, NED Europe is run by ex-head of European operations, Steve Hills. , it was still trading in London, England, as Synclavier Europe.

In 1998, under the company Demas, NED co-founder Cameron W. Jones (original and current owner of the Synclavier trademark and software) collaborated with ex-employee Brian S. George (owner of Demas, the company that purchased all of NED&#x27;s hardware and technical assets) and original co-founding partner Sydney Alonso to develop an emulator designed to run Synclavier software for Apple Computer&#x27;s Macintosh computer systems and hardware designed to share the core processing with the later generation of Apple G3 computers giving enhanced features and greater speed to the system.

<text>OCaml ( , formerly Objective Caml) is a general-purpose, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language which extends the Caml dialect of ML with object-oriented features. OCaml was created in 1996 by Xavier Leroy, Jérôme Vouillon, Damien Doligez, Didier Rémy, Ascánder Suárez, and others.

The OCaml toolchain includes an interactive top-level interpreter, a bytecode compiler, an optimizing native code compiler, a reversible debugger, and a package manager (OPAM) together with a composable build system for OCaml (Dune). OCaml was initially developed in the context of automated theorem proving, and is used in static analysis and formal methods software. Beyond these areas, it has found use in systems programming, web development, and specific financial utilities, among other application domains.

The acronym &quot;CAML&quot; originally stood for &quot;Categorical Abstract Machine Language&quot;, but OCaml omits this abstract machine. OCaml is a free and open-source software project managed and principally maintained by the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (Inria). In the early 2000s, elements from OCaml were adopted by many languages, notably F# and Scala.

==Philosophy==
ML-derived languages are best known for their static type systems and type-inferring compilers. OCaml unifies functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming under an ML-like type system. Thus, programmers need not be highly familiar with the pure functional language paradigm to use OCaml.

By requiring the programmer to work within the constraints of its static type system, OCaml eliminates many of the type-related runtime problems associated with dynamically typed languages. Also, OCaml&#x27;s type-inferring compiler greatly reduces the need for the manual type annotations that are required in most statically typed languages. For example, the data types of variables and the signatures of functions usually need not be declared explicitly, as they do in languages like Java and C#, because they can be inferred from the operators and other functions that are applied to the variables and other values in the code. Effective use of OCaml&#x27;s type system can require some sophistication on the part of a programmer, but this discipline is rewarded with reliable, high-performance software. 

OCaml is perhaps most distinguished from other languages with origins in academia by its emphasis on performance. Its static type system prevents runtime type mismatches and thus obviates runtime type and safety checks that burden the performance of dynamically typed languages, while still guaranteeing runtime safety, except when array bounds checking is turned off or when some type-unsafe features like serialization are used. These are rare enough that avoiding them is quite possible in practice.

Aside from type-checking overhead, functional programming languages are, in general, challenging to compile to efficient machine language code, due to issues such as the funarg problem. Along with standard loop, register, and instruction optimizations, OCaml&#x27;s optimizing compiler employs static program analysis methods to optimize value boxing and closure allocation, helping to maximize the performance of the resulting code even if it makes extensive use of functional programming constructs.

Xavier Leroy has stated that &quot;OCaml delivers at least 50% of the performance of a decent C compiler&quot;, although a direct comparison is impossible. Some functions in the OCaml standard library are implemented with faster algorithms than equivalent functions in the standard libraries of other languages. For example, the implementation of set union in the OCaml standard library in theory is asymptotically faster than the equivalent function in the standard libraries of imperative languages (e.g., C++, Java) because the OCaml implementation can exploit the immutability of sets to reuse parts of input sets in the output (see persistent data structure).

== History ==

=== Development of ML (Meta Language) ===
Between the 1970s and 1980s, Robin Milner, a British computer scientist and Turing Award winner, worked at the University of Edinburgh&#x27;s Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science. Milner and others were working on theorem provers, which were historically developed in languages such as Lisp. Milner repeatedly ran into the issue that the theorem provers would attempt to claim a proof was valid by putting non-proofs together. As a result, he went on to develop the meta language for his Logic for Computable Functions, a language that would only allow the writer to construct valid proofs with its polymorphic type system. ML was turned into a compiler to simplify using LCF on different machines, and, by the 1980s, was turned into a complete system of its own. ML would eventually serve as a basis for the creation of OCaml.

In the early 1980s, there were some developments that prompted INRIA&#x27;s Formel team to become interested in the ML language. Luca Cardelli, a research professor at University of Oxford, used his &quot;functional abstract machine&quot; to develop a faster implementation of ML, and Robin Milner proposed a new definition of ML to avoid divergence between various implementations. Simultaneously, Pierre-Louis Curien, a senior researcher at Paris Diderot University, developed a calculus of categorical combinators and linked it to lambda calculus, which led to the definition of the &quot;categorical abstract machine&quot; (CAM). Guy Cousineau, a researcher at Paris Diderot University, recognized that this could be applied as a compiling method for ML.

=== First implementation ===
Caml was initially designed and developed by INRIA&#x27;s Formel team headed by Gérard Huet. The first implementation of Caml was created in 1987 and was further developed until 1992. Though it was spearheaded by Ascánder Suárez, Pierre Weis and Michel Mauny carried on with development after he left in 1988.

Guy Cousineau is quoted recalling that his experience with programming language implementation was initially very limited, and that there were multiple inadequacies for which he is responsible. Despite this, he believes that &quot;Ascander, Pierre and Michel did quite a nice piece of work.”

=== Caml Light ===
Between 1990 and 1991, Xavier Leroy designed a new implementation of Caml based on a bytecode interpreter written in C. In addition to this, Damien Doligez wrote a memory management system, also known as a sequential garbage collector, for this implementation. This new implementation, known as Caml Light, replaced the old Caml implementation and ran on small desktop machines. In the following years, libraries such as Michel Mauny&#x27;s syntax manipulation tools appeared and helped promote the use of Caml in educational and research teams.

=== Caml Special Light ===
In 1995, Xavier Leroy released Caml Special Light, which was an improved version of Caml. An optimizing native-code compiler was added to the bytecode compiler, which greatly increased performance to comparable levels with mainstream languages such as C++. Also, Leroy designed a high-level module system inspired by the module system of Standard ML which provided powerful facilities for abstraction and parameterization and made larger-scale programs easier to build.

=== Objective Caml ===
Didier Rémy and Jérôme Vouillon designed an expressive type system for objects and classes, which was integrated within Caml Special Light. This led to the emergence of the Objective Caml language, first released in 1996 and subsequently renamed to OCaml in 2011. This object system notably supported many prevalent object-oriented idioms in a statically type-safe way, while those same idioms caused unsoundness or required runtime checks in languages such as C++ or Java. In 2000, Jacques Garrigue extended Objective Caml with multiple new features such as polymorphic methods, variants, and labeled and optional arguments.

=== Ongoing development ===
Language improvements have been incrementally added for the last two decades to support the growing commercial and academic codebases in OCaml. The OCaml 4.0 release in 2012 added Generalized Algebraic Data Types (GADTs) and first-class modules to increase the flexibility of the language. The OCaml 5.0.0 release in 2022 is a complete rewrite of the language runtime, removing the global GC lock and adding effect handlers via delimited continuations. These changes enable support for shared-memory parallelism and color-blind concurrency, respectively.

OCaml&#x27;s development continued within the Cristal team at INRIA until 2005, when it was succeeded by the Gallium team. Subsequently, Gallium was succeeded by the Cambium team in 2019. As of 2023, there are 23 core developers of the compiler distribution from a variety of organizations and 41 developers for the broader OCaml tooling and packaging ecosystem. In 2023, the OCaml compiler was recognised with ACM SIGPLAN&#x27;s Programming Languages Software Award.

==Features==
OCaml features a static type system, type inference, parametric polymorphism, tail recursion, pattern matching, first class lexical closures, functors (parametric modules), exception handling, effect handling, and incremental generational automatic garbage collection.

OCaml is notable for extending ML-style type inference to an object system in a general-purpose language. This permits structural subtyping, where object types are compatible if their method signatures are compatible, regardless of their declared inheritance (an unusual feature in statically typed languages).

A foreign function interface for linking to C primitives is provided, including language support for efficient numerical arrays in formats compatible with both C and Fortran. OCaml also supports creating libraries of OCaml functions that can be linked to a &quot;main&quot; program in C, so that an OCaml library can be distributed to C programmers who have no knowledge or installation of OCaml.

Although OCaml does not have a macro system as an indivisible part of the language (metaprogramming), i.e. built-in support for preprocessing, the OCaml platform does officially support a library for writing such preprocessors. These can be of two types: one that works at the source code level (as in C), and one that works on the Abstract Syntax Tree level. The latter, which is called PPX, acronym for Pre-Processor eXtension, is the recommended one.

The OCaml distribution contains:
* Lexical analysis and parsing tools called &quot;ocamllex&quot; and &quot;ocamlyacc&quot;
* Debugger that supports stepping backwards to investigate errors
* Documentation generator
* Profiler – to measure performance
* Many general-purpose libraries

The native code compiler is available for many platforms, including Unix, Microsoft Windows, and Apple macOS. Portability is achieved through native code generation support for major architectures: 

* X86-64 (AMD64), RISC-V, and ARM64 (in OCaml 5.0.0 and higher)
* IBM Z (before OCaml 5.0.0, and back in OCaml 5.1.0)
* Power (before OCaml 5.0.0, and due to reappear in OCaml 5.2.0)
* IA-32 and ARM (before OCaml 5.0.0)
* SPARC (before OCaml 4.06.0)
* DEC Alpha, HPPA, IA64 and MIPS (before OCaml 4.00.0)

The bytecode compiler supports operation on any 32- or 64-bit architecture when native code generation is not available, requiring only a C compiler.

OCaml bytecode and native code programs can be written in a multithreaded style, with preemptive context switching. OCaml threads in the same domain execute by time sharing only. However, an OCaml program can contain several domains.

==Code examples==

Snippets of OCaml code are most easily studied by entering them into the &quot;top-level REPL&quot;. This is an interactive OCaml session that prints the inferred types of resulting or defined expressions. The OCaml top-level is started by simply executing the OCaml program:
$ ocaml
 Objective Caml version 3.09.0

Code can then be entered at the &quot;#&quot; prompt. For example, to calculate 1+2*3:

# 1 + 2 * 3;;
- : int = 7
OCaml infers the type of the expression to be &quot;int&quot; (a machine-precision integer) and gives the result &quot;7&quot;.

===Hello World===
The following program &quot;hello.ml&quot;:
print_endline &quot;Hello World!&quot;
can be compiled into a bytecode executable:

 $ ocamlc hello.ml -o hello

or compiled into an optimized native-code executable:

 $ ocamlopt hello.ml -o hello

and executed:
$ ./hello
Hello World!


The first argument to ocamlc, &quot;hello.ml&quot;, specifies the source file to compile and the &quot;-o hello&quot; flag specifies the output file.

=== Option ===
The codice_1 type constructor in OCaml, similar to the codice_2 type in Haskell, augments a given data type to either return codice_3 value of the given data type, or to return codice_4. This is used to express that a value might or might not be present.
# Some 42;;
- : int option = Some 42
# None;;
- : &#x27;a option = None
This is an example of a function that either extracts an int from an option, if there is one inside, and converts it into a string, or if not, returns an empty string:
let extract o =
 match o with
 | Some i -&gt; string_of_int i
 | None -&gt; &quot;&quot;;;

# extract (Some 42);;
- : string = &quot;42&quot;
# extract None;;
- : string = &quot;&quot;
===Summing a list of integers===
Lists are one of the fundamental datatypes in OCaml. The following code example defines a recursive function &quot;sum&quot; that accepts one argument, &quot;integers&quot;, which is supposed to be a list of integers. Note the keyword codice_5 which denotes that the function is recursive. The function recursively iterates over the given list of integers and provides a sum of the elements. The &quot;match&quot; statement has similarities to C&#x27;s switch element, though it is far more general.
let rec sum integers = (* Keyword rec means &#x27;recursive&#x27;. *)
 match integers with
 | [] -&gt; 0 (* Yield 0 if integers is the empty 
 list []. *)
 | first :: rest -&gt; first + sum rest;; (* Recursive call if integers is a non-
 empty list; first is the first 
 element of the list, and rest is a 
 list of the rest of the elements, 
 possibly []. *)
 # sum [1;2;3;4;5];;
 - : int = 15
Another way is to use standard fold function that works with lists.
let sum integers =
 List.fold_left (fun accumulator x -&gt; accumulator + x) 0 integers;;
 # sum [1;2;3;4;5];;
 - : int = 15
Since the anonymous function is simply the application of the + operator, this can be shortened to:
let sum integers =
 List.fold_left (+) 0 integers
Furthermore, one can omit the list argument by making use of a partial application:
let sum =
 List.fold_left (+) 0
===Quicksort===
OCaml lends itself to concisely expressing recursive algorithms. The following code example implements an algorithm similar to quicksort that sorts a list in increasing order.
 let rec qsort = function
 | pivot :: rest -&gt;
 let is_less x = x &lt; pivot in
 let left, right = List.partition is_less rest in
 qsort left @ [pivot] @ qsort right
Or using partial application of the &gt;= operator.
 let rec qsort = function
 | pivot :: rest -&gt;
 let is_less = (&gt;=) pivot in
 let left, right = List.partition is_less rest in
 qsort left @ [pivot] @ qsort right
===Birthday problem===
The following program calculates the smallest number of people in a room for whom the probability of completely unique birthdays is less than 50% (the birthday problem, where for 1 person the probability is 365/365 (or 100%), for 2 it is 364/365, for 3 it is 364/365 × 363/365, etc.) (answer = 23).
let year_size = 365.

let rec birthday_paradox prob people =
 let prob = (year_size -. float people) /. year_size *. prob in
 if prob &lt; 0.5 then
 Printf.printf &quot;answer = %d\n&quot; (people+1)
 else
 birthday_paradox prob (people+1)

birthday_paradox 1.0 1
===Church numerals===
The following code defines a Church encoding of natural numbers, with successor (succ) and addition (add). A Church numeral is a higher-order function that accepts a function and a value and applies to exactly times. To convert a Church numeral from a functional value to a string, we pass it a function that prepends the string to its input and the constant string .
let zero f x = x
let succ n f x = f (n f x)
let one = succ zero
let two = succ (succ zero)
let add n1 n2 f x = n1 f (n2 f x)
let to_string n = n (fun k -&gt; &quot;S&quot; ^ k) &quot;0&quot;
let _ = to_string (add (succ two) two)
===Arbitrary-precision factorial function (libraries)===
A variety of libraries are directly accessible from OCaml. For example, OCaml has a built-in library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic. As the factorial function grows very rapidly, it quickly overflows machine-precision numbers (typically 32- or 64-bits). Thus, factorial is a suitable candidate for arbitrary-precision arithmetic.

In OCaml, the Num module (now superseded by the ZArith module) provides arbitrary-precision arithmetic and can be loaded into a running top-level using:

# #use &quot;topfind&quot;;;
# #require &quot;num&quot;;;
# open Num;;
The factorial function may then be written using the arbitrary-precision numeric operators , and :
# let rec fact n =
 if n =/ Int 0 then Int 1 else n */ fact(n -/ Int 1);;
val fact : Num.num -&gt; Num.num = &lt;fun&gt;
This function can compute much larger factorials, such as 120!:
# string_of_num (fact (Int 120));;
- : string =
&quot;6689502913449127057588118054090372586752746333138029810295671352301633
55724496298936687416527198498130815763789321409055253440858940812185989
8481114389650005964960521256960000000000000000000000000000&quot;
===Triangle (graphics)===
The following program renders a rotating triangle in 2D using OpenGL:
let () =
 ignore (Glut.init Sys.argv);
 Glut.initDisplayMode ~double_buffer:true ();
 ignore (Glut.createWindow ~title:&quot;OpenGL Demo&quot;);
 let angle t = 10. *. t *. t in
 let render () =
 GlClear.clear [ `color ];
 GlMat.load_identity ();
 GlMat.rotate ~angle: (angle (Sys.time ())) ~z:1. ();
 GlDraw.begins `triangles;
 List.iter GlDraw.vertex2 [-1., -1.; 0., 1.; 1., -1.];
 GlDraw.ends ();
 Glut.swapBuffers () in
 GlMat.mode `modelview;
 Glut.displayFunc ~cb:render;
 Glut.idleFunc ~cb:(Some Glut.postRedisplay);
 Glut.mainLoop ()
The LablGL bindings to OpenGL are required. The program may then be compiled to bytecode with:

 $ ocamlc -I +lablGL lablglut.cma lablgl.cma simple.ml -o simple

or to nativecode with:

 $ ocamlopt -I +lablGL lablglut.cmxa lablgl.cmxa simple.ml -o simple

or, more simply, using the ocamlfind build command
 $ ocamlfind opt simple.ml -package lablgl.glut -linkpkg -o simple

and run:

 $ ./simple

Far more sophisticated, high-performance 2D and 3D graphical programs can be developed in OCaml. Thanks to the use of OpenGL and OCaml, the resulting programs can be cross-platform, compiling without any changes on many major platforms.

===Fibonacci sequence===
The following code calculates the Fibonacci sequence of a number &quot;n&quot; inputted. It uses tail recursion and pattern matching.

let fib n =
 let rec fib_aux m a b =
 match m with
 | 0 -&gt; a
 | _ -&gt; fib_aux (m - 1) b (a + b)
 in fib_aux n 0 1
===Higher-order functions===
Functions may take functions as input and return functions as result. For example, applying &quot;twice&quot; to a function &quot;f&quot; yields a function that applies &quot;f&quot; two times to its argument.

let twice (f : &#x27;a -&gt; &#x27;a) = fun (x : &#x27;a) -&gt; f (f x);;
let inc (x : int) : int = x + 1;;
let add2 = twice inc;;
let inc_str (x : string) : string = x ^ &quot; &quot; ^ x;;
let add_str = twice(inc_str);;
 # add2 98;;
 - : int = 100
 # add_str &quot;Test&quot;;;
 - : string = &quot;Test Test Test Test&quot;

The function &quot;twice&quot; uses a type variable&quot; &#x27;a&quot; to indicate that it can be applied to any function &quot;f&quot; mapping from a type&quot; &#x27;a&quot; to itself, rather than only to &quot;int-&gt;int&quot; functions. In particular, &quot;twice&quot; can even be applied to itself.

 # let fourtimes f = (twice twice) f;;
 val fourtimes : (&#x27;a -&gt; &#x27;a) -&gt; &#x27;a -&gt; &#x27;a = &lt;fun&gt;
 # let add4 = fourtimes inc;;
 val add4 : int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
 # add4 98;;
 - : int = 102
==Derived languages==

===MetaOCaml===
MetaOCaml is a multi-stage programming extension of OCaml enabling incremental compiling of new machine code during runtime. Under some circumstances, significant speedups are possible using multistage programming, because more detailed information about the data to process is available at runtime than at the regular compile time, so the incremental compiler can optimize away many cases of condition checking, etc.

As an example: if at compile time it is known that some power function is needed often, but the value of is known only at runtime, a two-stage power function can be used in MetaOCaml:
let rec power n x =
 if n = 0
 then .&lt;1&gt;.
 else
 if even n
 then sqr (power (n/2) x)
 else .&lt;.~x *. .~(power (n - 1) x)&gt;.
As soon as is known at runtime, a specialized and very fast power function can be created:
.&lt;fun x -&gt; .~(power 5 .&lt;x&gt;.)&gt;.
The result is:
fun x_1 -&gt; (x_1 *
 let y_3 = 
 let y_2 = (x_1 * 1)
 in (y_2 * y_2)
 in (y_3 * y_3))
The new function is automatically compiled.

<text>Dissociative identity disorder (DID), previously known as multiple personality disorder (MPD), is characterized by the presence of at least two distinct and relatively enduring personality states. It has a history of extreme controversy.

The disorder is accompanied by memory gaps more severe than could be explained by ordinary forgetfulness.

According to the DSM-5-TR, early childhood trauma, typically starting before 5–6 years of age, places someone at risk of developing dissociative identity disorder. Across diverse geographic regions, 90% of people diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder report experiencing multiple forms of childhood abuse, such as rape, violence, neglect, or severe bullying. Other traumatic childhood experiences that have been reported include painful medical and surgical procedures, war, terrorism, attachment disturbance, natural disaster, cult and occult abuse, loss of a loved one or loved ones, human trafficking, and dysfunctional family dynamics.

There is no medication to treat DID directly, but medications can be used for comorbid disorders or targeted symptom relief—for example, antidepressants for anxiety and depression or sedative-hypnotics to improve sleep. Treatment generally involves supportive care and psychotherapy. The condition generally does not remit without treatment, and many patients have a lifelong course. 

Lifetime prevalence was found to be 1.1–1.5% of the general population (based on multiple epidemiological studies) and 3.9% of those admitted to psychiatric hospitals in Europe and North America. DID is diagnosed 6–9 times more often in women than in men. 

The number of recorded cases increased significantly in the latter half of the 20th century, along with the number of identities reported by those affected, but it is unclear whether increased rates of diagnosis are due to better recognition or to sociocultural factors such as mass media portrayals. The typical presenting symptoms in different regions of the world may also vary depending on culture, such as alter identities taking the form of possessing spirits, deities, ghosts, or mythical creatures in cultures where possession states are normative.

==Definitions==
Critics argue that dissociation, the term that underlies dissociative disorders, lacks a precise, empirical, and generally agreed upon definition.

Many diverse experiences have been termed dissociative, ranging from normal failures in attention to the breakdowns in memory processes characterized by the dissociative disorders. It is therefore unknown whether there is a commonality among all dissociative experiences, or whether the range of mild to severe symptoms is a result of different etiologies and biological structures. Other terms used in the literature, including personality, personality state, identity, ego state, and amnesia, also lack agreed upon definitions. Multiple competing models exist that incorporate some non-dissociative symptoms while excluding dissociative ones.

Due to the lack of consensus about terminology in the study of DID, several terms have been proposed. One is &quot;ego state&quot; (behaviors and experiences possessing permeable boundaries with other such states but united by a common sense of self). Another is &quot;alters&quot; (each of which may have a separate autobiographical memory, independent initiative and a sense of ownership over individual behavior).

==Signs and symptoms==
The full presentation of dissociative identity disorder can onset at any age, although symptoms typically begin by ages 5–10. DID is generally a childhood-onset disorder. According to the fifth edition [text revision] of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (&quot;DSM-5-TR&quot;), symptoms of DID include &quot;the presence of two or more distinct personality states&quot; accompanied by the inability to recall personal information beyond what is expected through normal memory issues. Other DSM-5 symptoms include a loss of identity as related to individual distinct personality states, loss of one&#x27;s subjective experience of the passage of time, and degradation of a sense of self and consciousness. In each individual, the clinical presentation varies and the level of functioning can change from severe impairment to minimal impairment. The symptoms of dissociative amnesia are subsumed under a DID diagnosis, and thus should not be diagnosed separately if DID criteria are met. Individuals with DID may experience distress from both the symptoms of DID (hearing voices, intrusive thoughts/emotions/impulses) and the consequences of the accompanying symptoms (inability to remember specific information or periods of time). The large majority of patients with DID report repeated childhood sexual and/or physical abuse, usually by caregivers as well as organized abuse. Amnesia between identities may be asymmetrical; identities may or may not be aware of what is known by another. Individuals with DID may be reluctant to discuss symptoms due to associations with abuse, shame, and fear.

Around half of people with DID have fewer than 10 identities and most have fewer than 100; although as many as 4,500 have been reported by Richard Kluft in 1988. The average number of identities has increased over the past few decades, from two or three to now an average of approximately 16. However, it is unclear whether this is due to an actual increase in identities, or simply that the psychiatric community has become more accepting of a high number of compartmentalized memory components.

===Comorbid disorders===
The psychiatric history frequently contains multiple previous diagnoses of various disorders and treatment failures. The most common presenting complaint of DID is depression (90%) that is often treatment-resistant, with headaches and non-epileptic seizures being common neurologic symptoms. Comorbid disorders include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance use disorders, eating disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and autism spectrum disorder. 30-70% of those diagnosed with DID have history of borderline personality disorder. Presentations of dissociation in people with schizophrenia differ from those with DID as not being rooted in trauma, and this distinction can be effectively tested, although both conditions share a high rate of auditory hallucinations in the form of voices. Other disorders that have been found to be comorbid with DID are somatization disorders, major depressive disorder, as well as history of a past suicide attempt, in comparison to those without a DID diagnosis. 70-75% of DID patients attempt suicide, and multiple attempts are common. Disturbed and altered sleep has also been suggested as having a role in dissociative disorders in general and specifically in DID, alterations in environments also largely affecting the DID patient. Individuals diagnosed with DID demonstrate the highest hypnotizability of any clinical population. Although DID has high comorbidity and its development is related to trauma, abundant empirical evidence suggests that DID is a separate condition from other disorders like PTSD.

==Causes==
===General===
There are two competing theories on what causes dissociative identity disorder to develop. The trauma-related model suggests that complex trauma or severe adversity in childhood, also known as developmental trauma, increases the risk of someone developing dissociative identity disorder. The non-trauma related model, also referred to as the sociogenic or fantasy model, suggests that dissociative identity disorder is developed through high fantasy-proneness or suggestibility, roleplaying, or sociocultural influences.

The DSM-5-TR states that &quot;early life trauma (e.g., neglect and physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, usually before ages 5-6 years) represents a major risk factor for dissociative identity disorder.&quot; Other risk factors reported include painful medical procedures, war, terrorism, or being trafficked in childhood. Dissociative disorders frequently occur after trauma, and the DSM-5-TR places them after the chapter on trauma- and stressor-related disorders to reflect this close relationship between complex trauma and dissociation.

===Traumagenic model===
Dissociative identity disorder is often conceptualized as &quot;the most severe form of a childhood-onset post-traumatic stress disorder.&quot; According to many researchers, the etiology of dissociative identity is multifactorial, involving a complex interaction between developmental trauma, sociocultural influences, and biological factors.

People diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder often report that they have experienced physical or sexual abuse during childhood (although the accuracy of these reports has been disputed); others report overwhelming stress, serious medical illness, or other traumatic events during childhood. They also report more historical psychological trauma than those diagnosed with any other mental illness.

Severe sexual, physical, or psychological trauma in childhood has been proposed as an explanation for its development; awareness, memories, and emotions of harmful actions or events caused by the trauma are sequestered away from consciousness, and alternate parts form with differing memories, emotions, beliefs, temperament and behavior. Dissociative identity disorder is also attributed to extremes of stress and disturbances of attachment to caregivers in early life. What may result in complex post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults may become dissociative identity disorder when occurring in children, possibly due to their greater use of imagination as a form of coping as well as lack of developmental integration in childhood.

Possibly due to developmental changes and a more coherent sense of self past age 6-9 years, the experience of extreme trauma may result in different, though also complex, dissociative symptoms, identity disturbances and trauma-related disorders. Relationships between childhood abuse, disorganized attachment, and lack of social support are thought to be common risk factors leading to dissociative identity disorder. Although the role of a child&#x27;s biological capacity to dissociate remains unclear, some evidence indicates a neurobiological impact of developmental stress. Moreover, children are universally born un-integrated.

Delinking early trauma from the etiology of dissociation has been explicitly rejected by those supporting the early trauma model. However, a 2012 review article supports the hypothesis that current or recent trauma may affect an individual&#x27;s assessment of the more distant past, changing the experience of the past and resulting in dissociative states. Giesbrecht et al. have suggested there is no actual empirical evidence linking early trauma to dissociation, and instead suggest that problems with neuropsychological functioning, such as increased distractibility in response to certain emotions and contexts, account for dissociative features. A middle position hypothesizes that trauma, in some situations, alters neuronal mechanisms related to memory. Evidence is increasing that dissociative disorders are related both to a trauma history and to &quot;specific neural mechanisms&quot;. It has also been suggested that there may be a genuine but more modest link between trauma and dissociative identity disorder, with early trauma causing increased fantasy-proneness, which may in turn render individuals more vulnerable to socio-cognitive influences surrounding the development of dissociative identity disorder. Another suggestion made by Hart indicates that there are triggers in the brain that can be the catalyst for different self-states, and that victims of trauma are more susceptible to these triggers than non-victims of trauma; these triggers are said to be related to dissociative identity disorder.

Paris states that the trauma model of dissociative identity disorder increased the appeal of the diagnosis among health care providers, patients and the public as it validated the idea that child abuse had lifelong, serious effects. Paris asserts that there is very little experimental evidence supporting the trauma-dissociation hypothesis, and no research showing that dissociation consistently links to long-term memory disruption.

Neuroimaging studies have reported a consistently smaller volume of the hippocampus in DID patients, supporting the trauma model.

===Sociogenic model===
Symptoms of dissociative identity disorder may be created by therapists using techniques to &quot;recover&quot; memories (such as the use of hypnosis to &quot;access&quot; alter identities, facilitate age regression or retrieve memories) on suggestible individuals. Referred to as the non-trauma-related model, or the sociocognitive model or fantasy model, it proposes that dissociative identity disorder is due to a person consciously or unconsciously behaving in certain ways promoted by cultural stereotypes, with unwitting therapists providing cues through improper therapeutic techniques. This model posits that behavior is enhanced by media portrayals of dissociative identity disorder.

Proponents of the non-trauma-related model note that the dissociative symptoms are rarely present before intensive therapy by specialists in the treatment of dissociative identity disorder who, through the process of eliciting, conversing with, and identifying alters, shape or possibly create the diagnosis. While proponents note that dissociative identity disorder is accompanied by genuine suffering and the distressing symptoms, and can be diagnosed reliably using the DSM criteria, they are skeptical of the trauma-related etiology suggested by proponents of the trauma-related model. Proponents of non-trauma-related dissociative identity disorder are concerned about the possibility of hypnotizability, suggestibility, frequent fantasization and mental absorption predisposing individuals to dissociation. They note that a small subset of doctors are responsible for diagnosing the majority of individuals with dissociative identity disorder.

Psychologist Nicholas Spanos and others have suggested that in addition to therapy-caused cases, dissociative identity disorder may be the result of role-playing, though others disagree, pointing to a lack of incentive to manufacture or maintain separate identities and point to the claimed histories of abuse. Other arguments that therapy can cause dissociative identity disorder include the lack of children diagnosed with DID, the sudden spike in rates of diagnosis after 1980 (although dissociative identity disorder was not a diagnosis until DSM-IV, published in 1994), the absence of evidence of increased rates of child abuse, the appearance of the disorder almost exclusively in individuals undergoing psychotherapy, particularly involving hypnosis, the presences of bizarre alternate identities (such as those claiming to be animals or mythological creatures) and an increase in the number of alternate identities over time (as well as an initial increase in their number as psychotherapy begins in DID-oriented therapy). These various cultural and therapeutic causes occur within a context of pre-existing psychopathology, notably borderline personality disorder, which is commonly comorbid with dissociative identity disorder. In addition, presentations can vary across cultures, such as Indian patients who only switch alters after a period of sleep – which is commonly how dissociative identity disorder is presented by the media within that country.

Proponents of non-trauma-related dissociative identity disorder state that the disorder is strongly linked to (possibly suggestive) psychotherapy, often involving recovered memories (memories that the person previously had amnesia for) or false memories, and that such therapy could cause additional identities. Such memories could be used to make an allegation of child sexual abuse. There is little agreement between those who see therapy as a cause and trauma as a cause. Supporters of therapy as a cause of dissociative identity disorder suggest that a small number of clinicians diagnosing a disproportionate number of cases would provide evidence for their position though it has also been claimed that higher rates of diagnosis in specific countries like the United States may be due to greater awareness of DID. Lower rates in other countries may be due to artificially low recognition of the diagnosis. However, false memory syndrome &quot;per se&quot; is not regarded by mental health experts as a valid diagnosis, and has been described as &quot;a non-psychological term originated by a private foundation whose stated purpose is to support accused parents,&quot; and critics argue that the concept has no empirical support, and further describe the False Memory Syndrome Foundation as an advocacy group that has distorted and misrepresented memory research.

===Children===

The rarity of DID diagnoses in children is cited as a reason to doubt the validity of the disorder, and proponents of both etiologies believe that the discovery of dissociative identity disorder in a child who had never undergone treatment would critically undermine the non-trauma related model. Conversely, if children are found to develop dissociative identity disorder only after undergoing treatment it would challenge the trauma-related model. , approximately 250 cases of dissociative identity disorder in children have been identified, though the data does not offer unequivocal support for either theory. While children have been diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder before therapy, several were presented to clinicians by parents who were themselves diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder; others were influenced by the appearance of dissociative identity disorder in popular culture or due to a diagnosis of psychosis due to hearing voices – a symptom also found in dissociative identity disorder. No studies have looked for children with dissociative identity disorder in the general population, and the single study that attempted to look for children with dissociative identity disorder not already in therapy did so by examining siblings of those already in therapy for dissociative identity disorder. An analysis of diagnosis of children reported in scientific publications, 44 case studies of single patients were found to be evenly distributed (i.e., each case study was reported by a different author) but in articles regarding groups of patients, four researchers were responsible for the majority of the reports.

The initial theoretical description of dissociative identity disorder was that dissociative symptoms were a means of coping with extreme stress (particularly childhood sexual and physical abuse), but this belief has been challenged by the data of multiple research studies. Proponents of the trauma-related model claim the high correlation of child sexual and physical abuse reported by adults with dissociative identity disorder corroborates the link between trauma and dissociative identity disorder. However, the link between dissociative identity disorder and maltreatment has been questioned for several reasons. The studies reporting the links often rely on self-report rather than independent corroborations, and these results may be worsened by selection and referral bias. Most studies of trauma and dissociation are cross-sectional rather than longitudinal, which means researchers can not attribute causation, and studies avoiding recall bias have failed to corroborate such a causal link. In addition, studies rarely control for the many disorders comorbid with dissociative identity disorder, or family maladjustment (which is itself highly correlated with dissociative identity disorder). The popular association of dissociative identity disorder with childhood abuse is relatively recent, occurring only after the publication of &quot;Sybil&quot; in 1973. Most previous examples of &quot;multiples&quot; such as Chris Costner Sizemore, whose life was depicted in the book and film &quot;The Three Faces of Eve&quot;, reported no memory of childhood trauma.

==Pathophysiology==
Despite research on DID including structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, event-related potentials, and electroencephalography, no convergent neuroimaging findings have been identified regarding DID, with the exception of smaller hippocampal volume in DID patients. In addition, many of the studies that do exist were performed from an explicitly trauma-based position. There is no research to date regarding the neuroimaging and introduction of false memories in DID patients, though there is evidence of changes in visual parameters and support for amnesia between alters. DID patients also appear to show deficiencies in tests of conscious control of attention and memorization (which also showed signs of compartmentalization for implicit memory between alters but no such compartmentalization for verbal memory) and increased and persistent vigilance and startle responses to sound. DID patients may also demonstrate altered neuroanatomy.

==Diagnosis==
===General===
The fifth, revised edition of the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR) diagnoses DID according to the diagnostic criteria found under code 300.14 (dissociative disorders). DID is often initially misdiagnosed because clinicians receive little training about dissociative disorders or DID, and often use standard diagnostic interviews that do not include questions about trauma, dissociation, or post-traumatic symptoms. This contributes to difficulties diagnosing the disorder, and to clinician bias.

DID is rarely diagnosed in children. The criteria require that an individual be recurrently controlled by two or more discrete identities or personality states, accompanied by memory lapses for important information that is not caused by alcohol, drugs or medications and other medical conditions such as complex partial seizures. In children, the symptoms must not be better explained by &quot;imaginary playmates or other fantasy play&quot;. Diagnosis is normally performed by a clinically trained mental health professional such as a psychiatrist or psychologist through clinical evaluation, interviews with family and friends, and consideration of other ancillary material. Specially designed interviews (such as the SCID-D) and personality assessment tools may be used in the evaluation as well. Since most of the symptoms depend on self-report and are not concrete and observable, there is a degree of subjectivity in making the diagnosis. People are often disinclined to seek treatment, especially since their symptoms may not be taken seriously; thus dissociative disorders have been referred to as &quot;diseases of hiddenness&quot;.

The diagnosis has been criticized by supporters of &quot;therapy as a cause&quot; or the sociocognitive hypothesis as they believe it is a culture-bound and often health care induced condition. The social cues involved in diagnosis may be instrumental in shaping patient behavior or attribution, such that symptoms within one context may be linked to DID, while in another time or place the diagnosis could have been something other than DID. Other researchers disagree and argue that the existence of the condition and its inclusion in the DSM is supported by multiple lines of reliable evidence, with diagnostic criteria allowing it to be clearly discriminated from conditions it is often mistaken for (schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and seizure disorder). That a large proportion of cases are diagnosed by specific health care providers, and that symptoms have been created in nonclinical research subjects given appropriate cueing has been suggested as evidence that a small number of clinicians who specialize in DID are responsible for the creation of alters through therapy.

===Differential diagnoses===
Patients with DID are diagnosed with 5-7 comorbid disorders on average – higher than other mental conditions. Misdiagnoses (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) are very common among patients with DID.

Due to overlapping symptoms, the differential diagnosis includes schizophrenia, normal and rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, epilepsy, borderline personality disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. Delusions or auditory hallucinations can be mistaken for speech by other personalities. Persistence and consistency of identities and behavior, amnesia, measures of dissociation or hypnotizability and reports from family members or other associates indicating a history of such changes can help distinguish DID from other conditions. A diagnosis of DID takes precedence over any other dissociative disorders. Distinguishing DID from malingering is a concern when financial or legal gains are an issue, and factitious disorder may also be considered if the person has a history of help or attention-seeking. Individuals who state that their symptoms are due to external spirits or entities entering their bodies are generally diagnosed with dissociative disorder not otherwise specified rather than DID due to the lack of identities or personality states. Most individuals who enter an emergency department and are unaware of their names are generally in a psychotic state. Although auditory hallucinations are common in DID, complex visual hallucinations may also occur. Those with DID generally have adequate reality testing. People with DID may have more positive and less negative Schneiderian symptoms of schizophrenia. The DID persona perceives any voices heard as coming from inside their heads whereas the schizophrenia persona perceives voices as external). In addition, individuals with psychosis are much less susceptible to hypnosis than those with DID. Difficulties in differential diagnosis are increased in children.

DID must be distinguished from, or determined if comorbid with, a variety of disorders including mood disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders, PTSD, personality disorders, cognitive disorders, neurological disorders, epilepsy, somatoform disorder, factitious disorder, malingering, other dissociative disorders, and trance states. An additional aspect of the controversy of diagnosis is that there are many forms of dissociation and memory lapses, which can be common in both stressful and nonstressful situations and can be attributed to much less controversial diagnoses. 

A relationship between DID and borderline personality disorder has been posited, with various clinicians noting overlap between symptoms and behaviors and it has been suggested that some cases of DID may arise &quot;from a substrate of borderline traits&quot;. Reviews of DID patients and their medical records concluded that 30-70% of those diagnosed with DID have comorbid borderline personality disorder.

The DSM-5 elaborates on cultural background as an influence for some presentations of DID.

==Controversy and criticism of validity==
DID is among the most controversial of the dissociative disorders and among the most controversial disorders found in the DSM-5-TR. The primary dispute is between those who believe DID is caused by traumatic stresses that split the mind into multiple identities, each with a separate set of memories, and those who believe that the symptoms of DID are produced artificially by certain psychotherapeutic practices or patients playing a role they believe appropriate for a person with DID. The debate between the two positions is characterized by intense disagreement. Research has been characterized by poor methodology. Psychiatrist Joel Paris notes that the idea that a personality is capable of splitting into independent alters is an unproven assertion at odds with research in cognitive psychology.

Some people, such as Russell A. Powell and Travis L. Gee, believe that DID is caused by health care, i.e. symptoms of DID are created by therapists themselves via hypnosis. This implies that those with DID are especially susceptible to manipulation by hypnosis and suggestion. The iatrogenic model also sometimes states that treatment for DID is harmful. According to Brand, Loewenstein, and Spiegel, &quot;claims that DID treatment is harmful are based on anecdotal cases, opinion pieces, reports of damage that are not substantiated in the scientific literature, misrepresentations of the data, and misunderstandings about DID treatment and the phenomenology of DID&quot;. Their claim is evidenced by the fact that only 5%–10% of people receiving treatment initially worsen in their symptoms.

Psychiatrists August Piper and Harold Merskey have challenged the trauma hypothesis, arguing that correlation does not imply causation—that people with DID report childhood trauma does not mean trauma causes DID—and point to the rarity of the diagnosis before 1980 as well as a failure to find DID as an outcome in longitudinal studies of traumatized children. They assert that DID cannot be accurately diagnosed because of vague and unclear diagnostic criteria in the DSM and undefined concepts such as &quot;personality state&quot; and &quot;identities&quot;, and question the evidence for childhood abuse beyond self-reports, the lack of a defined threshold of abuse sufficient to induce DID, and the extremely small number of cases of children diagnosed with DID despite an average age of appearance of the first alter of three years. Psychiatrist Colin Ross disagrees with Piper and Merskey&#x27;s conclusion that DID cannot be accurately diagnosed, pointing to internal consistency between different structured dissociative disorder interviews (including the Dissociative Experiences Scale, Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule, and Structured Clinical Interview for Dissociative Disorders) in the internal validity range of widely accepted mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. In his opinion, Piper and Merskey set the standard of proof higher than it is for other diagnoses. He also asserts that Piper and Merskey have cherry-picked data and not incorporated all relevant scientific literature, such as independent corroborating evidence of trauma.

A paper published in 2022 in the journal Comprehensive Psychiatry described how prolonged social media use, especially on video-sharing platforms including TikTok, has exposed young people, largely adolescent females, a core user group of TikTok, to a growing number of content creators making videos about their self-diagnosed disorders. &quot;An increasing number of reports from the US, UK, Germany, Canada, and Australia have noted an increase in functional tic-like behaviors prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, coinciding with an increase in social media content related to[…]dissociative identity disorder.&quot; The paper concluded that there &quot;is an urgent need for focused empirical research investigation into this concerning phenomenon that is related to the broader research and discourse examining social media influences on mental health&quot;.

==Treatment==

=== Treatment under the sociogenic model ===
Proponents of the sociogenic model dispute that dissociative identity disorder is an organic response to trauma, but believe it is a socially constructed behavior and psychic contagion. McHugh says that the disorder is &quot;sustained in large part by the attention that doctors tend to pay to it. This means that it is not a mental condition that derives from nature, such as panic anxiety or major depression. It exists in the world as an artificial product of human devising&quot;.

According to McHugh, at Johns Hopkins Hospital doctors should ignore the displays from &quot;alters&quot;, and instead focus on treatment for other psychiatric problems patients present with. This method of treatment is reportedly successful:

McHugh believes that proponents of Dissociative Identity Disorder inadvertently worsen patient condition by validating the behavior and providing attention.

=== Treatments under the trauma model ===
The International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation, proponents of the trauma model, have published guidelines for &quot;phase-oriented&quot; treatment in adults as well as children and adolescents that are widely used successfully in the field of DID treatment. The guidelines state that &quot;a desirable treatment outcome is a workable form of integration or harmony among alternate identities&quot;. Some experts in treating people with DID use the techniques recommended in the 2011 treatment guidelines. The empirical research includes the longitudinal TOP DD treatment study, which found that patients showed &quot;statistically significant reductions in dissociation, PTSD, distress, depression, hospitalisations, suicide attempts, self-harm, dangerous behaviours, drug use, and physical pain&quot; and improved overall functioning. Treatment effects have been studied for over thirty years, with some studies having a follow-up of ten years. Adult and child treatment guidelines exist that suggest a three-phased approach.

Common treatment methods include an eclectic mix of psychotherapy techniques, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), insight-oriented therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), hypnotherapy, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).

Hypnosis should be carefully considered when choosing both treatment and provider practitioners because of its dangers. For example, hypnosis can sometimes lead to false memories and false accusations of abuse by family, loved ones, friends, providers, and community members. Those who suffer from dissociative identity disorder have commonly been subject to actual abuse (sexual, physical, emotional, financial) by therapists, family, friends, loved ones, and community members.

Brief treatment due to managed care may be difficult, as individuals diagnosed with DID may have unusual difficulties in trusting a therapist and take a prolonged period to form a comfortable therapeutic alliance. Regular contact (at least weekly) is recommended, and treatment generally lasts years – not weeks or months. Sleep hygiene has been suggested as a treatment option, but has not been tested. In general there are very few clinical trials on the treatment of DID, none of which were randomized controlled trials.

Therapy for DID is generally phase oriented. Different alters may appear based on their greater ability to deal with specific situational stresses or threats. While some patients may initially present with a large number of alters, this number may reduce during treatment – though it is considered important for the therapist to become familiar with at least the more prominent personality states as the &quot;host&quot; personality may not be the &quot;true&quot; identity of the patient. Specific alters may react negatively to therapy, fearing the therapist&#x27;s goal is to eliminate the alter (particularly those associated with illegal or violent activities). A more realistic and appropriate goal of treatment is to integrate adaptive responses to abuse, injury, or other threats into the overall personality structure.

The first phase of therapy focuses on symptoms and relieving the distressing aspects of the condition, ensuring the safety of the individual, improving the patient&#x27;s capacity to form and maintain healthy relationships, and improving general daily life functioning. Comorbid disorders such as substance use disorder and eating disorders are addressed in this phase of treatment. The second phase focuses on stepwise exposure to traumatic memories and prevention of re-dissociation. The final phase focuses on reconnecting the identities of disparate alters into a single functioning identity with all its memories and experiences intact.

==Prognosis==
Little is known about prognosis of untreated DID. Symptoms commonly wax and wane over time. Patients with mainly dissociative and post-traumatic symptoms face a better prognosis than those with comorbid disorders or those still in contact with abusers, and the latter groups often face a lengthier and more difficult treatment course. Suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and self-harm are common in the DID population. Duration of treatment can vary depending on patient goals, which can range from merely improving inter-alter communication and cooperation, to reducing inter-alter amnesia, to integration and &quot;fusion&quot; of all alters, but this last goal generally takes years, with trained and experienced psychotherapists.

==Epidemiology==
===General===
According to the American Psychiatric Association, the 12-month prevalence of DID among adults in the US is 1.5%, with similar prevalence between women and men. Population prevalence estimates have been described to widely vary, with some estimates of DID in &quot;inpatient&quot; settings suggesting 1-9.6%.&quot; Reported rates in the community vary from 1% to 3% with higher rates among psychiatric patients. As of 2017, evidence suggested a prevalence of DID of 2–5% among psychiatric inpatients, 2–3% among outpatients, and 1% in the general population, with rates reported as high as 16.4% for teenagers in psychiatric outpatient services.

As of 2012, DID was diagnosed 5 to 9 times more common in women than men during young adulthood, although this may have been due to selection bias as men meeting DID diagnostic criteria were suspected to end up in the criminal justice system rather than hospitals. DID diagnoses are extremely rare in children; much of the research on childhood DID occurred in the 1980s and 1990s and does not address ongoing controversies surrounding the diagnosis. DID occurs more commonly in young adults and declines in prevalence with age.

There is a poor awareness of DID in the clinical settings and the general public. Poor clinical education (or lack thereof) for DID and other dissociative disorders has been described in literature: &quot;most clinicians have been taught (or assume) that DID is a rare disorder with a florid, dramatic presentation.&quot; Symptoms in patients are often not easily visible, which complicates diagnosis. DID has a high correlation with, and has been described as a form of, complex post-traumatic stress disorder. There is a significant overlap of symptoms between borderline personality disorder and DID.

===Historical prevalence===
Rates of diagnosed DID were increasing in the late 20th century, reaching a peak of diagnoses at approximately 40,000 cases by the end of the 20th century, up from less than 200 diagnoses before 1970. Initially DID along with the rest of the dissociative disorders were considered the rarest of psychological conditions, diagnosed in less than 100 by 1944, with only one further case reported in the next two decades. In the late 1970s and &#x27;80s, the number of diagnoses rose sharply. An estimate from the 1980s placed the incidence at 0.01%. Accompanying this rise was an increase in the number of alters, rising from only the primary and one alter personality in most cases, to an average of 13 in the mid-1980s (the increase in both number of cases and number of alters within each case are both factors in professional skepticism regarding the diagnosis). Others explain the increase as being due to the use of inappropriate therapeutic techniques in highly suggestible individuals, though this is itself controversial while proponents of DID claim the increase in incidence is due to increased recognition of and ability to recognize the disorder.

A 1996 essay suggested three possible causes for the sudden increase of DID diagnoses, among which the author suspects the first being most likely:

# The result of therapist suggestions to suggestible people, much as Charcot&#x27;s hysterics acted in accordance with his expectations.
# Psychiatrists&#x27; past failure to recognize dissociation being redressed by new training and knowledge.
# Dissociative phenomena are actually increasing, but this increase only represents a new form of an old and protean entity: &quot;hysteria&quot;.
Dissociative disorders were excluded from the Epidemiological Catchment Area Project.

===North America===
DID continues to be considered a controversial diagnosis; it was once regarded as a phenomenon confined to North America, though studies have since been published from DID populations across 6 continents. Although research has appeared discussing the appearance of DID in other countries and cultures and the condition has been described in non-English speaking nations and non-Western cultures, these reports all occur in English-language journals authored by international researchers who cite Western scientific literature.

==History==
===Early references===
In the 19th century, &quot;&quot;dédoublement&quot;,&quot; or &quot;double consciousness&quot;, the historical precursor to DID, was frequently described as a state of sleepwalking, with scholars hypothesizing that the patients were switching between a normal consciousness and a &quot;somnambulistic state&quot;.

An intense interest in spiritualism, parapsychology and hypnosis continued throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, running in parallel with John Locke&#x27;s views that there was an association of ideas requiring the coexistence of feelings with awareness of the feelings. Hypnosis, which was pioneered in the late 18th century by Franz Mesmer and Armand-Marie Jacques de Chastenet, Marques de Puységur, challenged Locke&#x27;s association of ideas. Hypnotists reported what they thought were second personalities emerging during hypnosis and wondered how two minds could coexist.

In the 19th century, there were a number of reported cases of multiple personalities which Rieber estimated would be close to 100. Epilepsy was seen as a factor in some cases, and discussion of this connection continues into the present era.

By the late 19th century, there was a general acceptance that emotionally traumatic experiences could cause long-term disorders which might display a variety of symptoms. These conversion disorders were found to occur in even the most resilient individuals, but with profound effect in someone with emotional instability like Louis Vivet (1863–?), who had a traumatic experience as a 17-year-old when he encountered a viper. Vivet was the subject of countless medical papers and became the most studied case of dissociation in the 19th century.

Between 1880 and 1920, various international medical conferences devoted time to sessions on dissociation. It was in this climate that Jean-Martin Charcot introduced his ideas of the impact of nervous shocks as a cause for a variety of neurological conditions. One of Charcot&#x27;s students, Pierre Janet, took these ideas and went on to develop his own theories of dissociation. One of the first individuals diagnosed with multiple personalities to be scientifically studied was Clara Norton Fowler, under the pseudonym Christine Beauchamp; American neurologist Morton Prince studied Fowler between 1898 and 1904, describing her case study in his 1906 monograph, &quot;Dissociation of a Personality&quot;.

===20th century===
In the early 20th century, interest in dissociation and multiple personalities waned for several reasons. After Charcot&#x27;s death in 1893, many of his so-called hysterical patients were exposed as frauds, and Janet&#x27;s association with Charcot tarnished his theories of dissociation. Sigmund Freud recanted his earlier emphasis on dissociation and childhood trauma.

In 1908, Eugen Bleuler introduced the term &quot;schizophrenia&quot; to represent a revised disease concept for Emil Kraepelin&#x27;s &quot;dementia praecox.&quot; Whereas Kraepelin&#x27;s natural disease entity was anchored in the metaphor of progressive deterioration and mental weakness and defect, Bleuler offered a reinterpretation based on dissociation or &quot;splitting&quot; (&quot;Spaltung&quot;) and widely broadened the inclusion criteria for the diagnosis. A review of the &quot;Index medicus&quot; from 1903 through 1978 showed a dramatic decline in the number of reports of multiple personality after the diagnosis of schizophrenia became popular, especially in the United States. The rise of the broad diagnostic category of dementia praecox has also been posited in the disappearance of &quot;hysteria&quot; (the usual diagnostic designation for cases of multiple personalities) by 1910. A number of factors helped create a large climate of skepticism and disbelief; paralleling the increased suspicion of DID was the decline of interest in dissociation as a laboratory and clinical phenomenon.

Starting in about 1927, there was a large increase in the number of reported cases of schizophrenia, which was matched by an equally large decrease in the number of multiple personality reports. With the rise of a uniquely American reframing of dementia praecox/schizophrenia as a functional disorder or &quot;reaction&quot; to psychobiological stressors – a theory first put forth by Adolf Meyer in 1906—many trauma-induced conditions associated with dissociation, including &quot;shell shock&quot; or &quot;war neuroses&quot; during World War I, were subsumed under these diagnoses. It was argued in the 1980s that DID patients were often misdiagnosed with schizophrenia.

The public, however, was exposed to psychological ideas which took their interest. Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;, and many short stories by Edgar Allan Poe had a formidable impact.

====&quot;The Three Faces of Eve&quot;====
In 1957, with the publication of the bestselling book &quot;The Three Faces of Eve&quot; by psychiatrists Corbett H. Thigpen and Hervey M. Cleckley, based on a case study of their patient Chris Costner Sizemore, and the subsequent popular movie of the same name, the American public&#x27;s interest in multiple personality was revived. More cases of dissociative identity disorder were diagnosed in the following years. The cause of the sudden increase of cases is indefinite, but it may be attributed to the increased awareness, which revealed previously undiagnosed cases or new cases may have been induced by the influence of the media on the behavior of individuals and the judgement of therapists. During the 1970s an initially small number of clinicians campaigned to have it considered a legitimate diagnosis.

===History in the DSM===
The DSM-II used the term &quot;hysterical neurosis, dissociative type&quot;. It described the possible occurrence of alterations in the patient&#x27;s state of consciousness or identity, and included the symptoms of &quot;amnesia, somnambulism, fugue, and multiple personality&quot;. The DSM-III grouped the diagnosis with the other four major dissociative disorders using the term &quot;multiple personality disorder&quot;. The DSM-IV made more changes to DID than any other dissociative disorder, and renamed it DID. The name was changed for two reasons: First, the change emphasizes the main problem is not a multitude of personalities, but rather a lack of a single, unified identity and an emphasis on &quot;the identities as centers of information processing&quot;. Second, the term &quot;personality&quot; is used to refer to &quot;characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings, moods, and behaviors of the whole individual&quot;, while for a patient with DID, the switches between identities and behavior patterns is the personality. It is, for this reason, the DSM-IV-TR referred to &quot;distinct identities or personality states&quot; instead of personalities. The diagnostic criteria also changed to indicate that while the patient may name and personalize alters, they lack independent, objective existence. The changes also included the addition of amnesia as a symptom, which was not included in the DSM-III-R because despite being a core symptom of the condition, patients may experience &quot;amnesia for the amnesia&quot; and fail to report it. Amnesia was replaced when it became clear that the risk of false negative diagnoses was low because amnesia was central to DID.

The ICD-10 places the diagnosis in the category of &quot;dissociative disorders&quot;, within the subcategory of &quot;other dissociative (conversion) disorders&quot;, but continues to list the condition as multiple personality disorder.

The DSM-IV-TR criteria for DID have been criticized for failing to capture the clinical complexity of DID, lacking usefulness in diagnosing individuals with DID (for instance, by focusing on the two least frequent and most subtle symptoms of DID) producing a high rate of false negatives and an excessive number of DDNOS diagnoses, for excluding possession (seen as a cross-cultural form of DID), and for including only two &quot;core&quot; symptoms of DID (amnesia and self-alteration) while failing to discuss hallucinations, trance-like states, somatoform, depersonalization, and derealization symptoms. Arguments have been made for allowing diagnosis through the presence of some, but not all of the characteristics of DID rather than the current exclusive focus on the two least common and noticeable features. The DSM-IV-TR criteria have also been criticized for being tautological, using imprecise and undefined language and for the use of instruments that give a false sense of validity and empirical certainty to the diagnosis.

The DSM-5 updated the definition of DID in 2013, summarizing the changes as:

Between 1968 and 1980, the term that was used for dissociative identity disorder was &quot;Hysterical neurosis, dissociative type&quot;. The APA wrote in the second edition of the DSM: &quot;In the dissociative type, alterations may occur in the patient&#x27;s state of consciousness or in his identity, to produce such symptoms as amnesia, somnambulism, fugue, and multiple personality.&quot; The number of cases sharply increased in the late 1970s and throughout the 80s, and the first scholarly monographs on the topic appeared in 1986.

====Book and film &quot;Sybil&quot;====
In 1974, the highly influential book &quot;Sybil&quot; was published, and later made into a miniseries in 1976 and again in 2007. Describing what Robert Rieber called &quot;the third most famous of multiple personality cases,&quot; it presented a detailed discussion of the problems of treatment of &quot;Sybil Isabel Dorsett&quot;, a pseudonym for Shirley Ardell Mason.

Though the book and subsequent films helped popularize the diagnosis and trigger an epidemic of the diagnosis, later analysis of the case suggested different interpretations, ranging from Mason&#x27;s problems having been caused by the therapeutic methods and sodium pentathol injections used by her psychiatrist, C. B. Wilbur, or an inadvertent hoax due in part to the lucrative publishing rights, though this conclusion has itself been challenged.

David Spiegel, a Stanford psychiatrist whose father treated Shirley Ardell Mason on occasion, says that his father described Mason as &quot;a brilliant hysteric. He felt that Wilbur tended to pressure her to exaggerate on the dissociation she already had.&quot; As media attention on DID increased, so too did the controversy surrounding the diagnosis.

====Re-classifications====
The DSM-III intentionally omitted the terms &quot;hysteria&quot; and &quot;neurosis&quot;, naming those as Dissociative Disorders, which included Multiple Personality Disorder, and also added Post-traumatic Stress Disorder in Anxiety Disorders section.

In the opinion of McGill University psychiatrist Joel Paris, this inadvertently legitimized them by forcing textbooks, which mimicked the structure of the DSM, to include a separate chapter on them and resulted in an increase in diagnosis of dissociative conditions. Once a rarely occurring spontaneous phenomenon (research in 1944 showed only 76 cases), the diagnosis became &quot;an artifact of bad (or naïve) psychotherapy&quot; as patients capable of dissociating were accidentally encouraged to express their symptoms by &quot;overly fascinated&quot; therapists.

In a 1986 book chapter (later reprinted in another volume), philosopher of science Ian Hacking focused on multiple personality disorder as an example of &quot;making up people&quot; through the untoward effects on individuals of the &quot;dynamic nominalism&quot; in medicine and psychiatry. With the invention of new terms, entire new categories of &quot;natural kinds&quot; of people are assumed to be created, and those thus diagnosed respond by re-creating their identity in light of the new cultural, medical, scientific, political and moral expectations. Hacking argued that the process of &quot;making up people&quot; is historically contingent, hence it is not surprising to find the rise, fall, and resurrection of such categories over time. Hacking revisited his concept of &quot;making up people&quot; in a 2006.

&quot;Interpersonality amnesia&quot; was removed as a diagnostic feature from the DSM III in 1987, which may have contributed to the increasing frequency of the diagnosis. There were 200 reported cases of DID as of 1980, and 20,000 from 1980 to 1990. Joan Acocella reports that 40,000 cases were diagnosed from 1985 to 1995. Scientific publications regarding DID peaked in the mid-1990s then rapidly declined.

There were several contributing factors to the rapid decline of reports of multiple personality disorder/dissociative identity disorder. One was the discontinuation in December 1997 of &quot;Dissociation: Progress in the Dissociative Disorders,&quot; the journal of The International Society for the Study of Multiple Personality and Dissociation. The society and its journal were perceived as uncritical sources of legitimacy for the extraordinary claims of the existence of intergenerational satanic cults responsible for a &quot;hidden holocaust&quot; of Satanic ritual abuse that was linked to the rise of MPD reports. In an effort to distance itself from the increasing skepticism regarding the clinical validity of MPD, the organization dropped &quot;multiple personality&quot; from its official name in 1993, and then in 1997 changed its name again to the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation.

In 1994, the fourth edition of the DSM replaced the criteria again and changed the name of the condition from &quot;multiple personality disorder&quot; to the current &quot;dissociative identity disorder&quot; to emphasize the importance of changes to consciousness and identity rather than personality. The inclusion of interpersonality amnesia helped to distinguish DID from dissociative disorder not otherwise specified (DDNOS), but the condition retains an inherent subjectivity due to difficulty in defining terms such as personality, identity, ego-state, and even amnesia. The ICD-10 classified DID as a &quot;Dissociative [conversion] disorder&quot; and used the name &quot;multiple personality disorder&quot; with the classification number of F44.81. In the ICD-11, the World Health Organization have classified DID under the name &quot;dissociative identity disorder&quot; (code 6B64), and most cases formerly diagnosed as DDNOS are classified as &quot;partial dissociative identity disorder&quot; (code 6B65).

===21st century===
A 2006 study compared scholarly research and publications on DID and dissociative amnesia to other mental health conditions, such as anorexia nervosa, alcohol use disorder, and schizophrenia from 1984 to 2003. The results were found to be unusually distributed, with a very low level of publications in the 1980s followed by a significant rise that peaked in the mid-1990s and subsequently rapidly declined in the decade following. Compared to 25 other diagnosis, the mid-1990s &quot;bubble&quot; of publications regarding DID was unique. In the opinion of the authors of the review, the publication results suggest a period of &quot;fashion&quot; that waned, and that the two diagnoses &quot;[did] not command widespread scientific acceptance.&quot;

==Society and culture==
===In popular culture===
The public&#x27;s long fascination with DID has led to a number of different books and films, with many representations described as increasing stigma by perpetuating the myth that people with mental illness are usually dangerous. Movies about DID have been also criticized for poor representation of both DID and its treatment, including &quot;greatly overrepresenting&quot; the role of hypnosis in therapy, showing a significantly smaller number of personalities than many people with DID have, and misrepresenting people with DID as having theatrical and blatant switches between very conspicuous and different alters. Some movies are parodies and ridicule DID, for instance, &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot;, which also incorrectly states that DID is schizophrenia. In some stories, DID is used as a plot device, e.g. in &quot;Fight Club&quot;, and in whodunnit stories like &quot;Secret Window&quot;.

&quot;United States of Tara&quot; was reported to be the first US television series with DID as its focus, and a professional commentary on each episode was published by the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation.

A number of people with DID have publicly spoken about their experiences, including comedian and talk show host Roseanne Barr, who interviewed Truddi Chase, author of &quot;When Rabbit Howls&quot;; Chris Costner Sizemore, the subject of &quot;The Three Faces of Eve&quot;, Cameron West, author of &quot;First Person Plural: My life as a multiple&quot;, and NFL player Herschel Walker, author of &quot;Breaking Free: My life with dissociative identity disorder&quot;.

In &quot;The Three Faces of Eve&quot; (1957) hypnosis is used to identify a childhood trauma which then allows her to fuse from three identities into just one. However, Sizemore&#x27;s own books &quot;I&#x27;m Eve&quot; and &quot;A Mind of My Own&quot; revealed that this did not last; she later attempted suicide, sought further treatment, and actually had twenty-two personalities rather than three. Sizemore re-entered therapy and by 1974 had achieved a lasting recovery. &quot;Voices Within: The Lives of Truddi Chase&quot; portrays many of the 92 personalities Chase described in her book &quot;When Rabbit Howls&quot;, and is unusual in breaking away from the typical ending of integrating into one. &quot;Frankie &amp; Alice&quot; (2010), starring Halle Berry was based on a real person with DID. In popular culture dissociative identity disorder is often confused with schizophrenia, as was true of the 1958 episode &quot;The Case of the Deadly Double&quot; of the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; TV series, where a woman shown as having two very distinct personas is described as being schizophrenic On the other hand, some movies advertised as representing dissociative identity disorder may be more representative of psychosis or schizophrenia, for example &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960). 

In his book &quot;The C.I.A. Doctors: Human Rights Violations by American Psychiatrists&quot;, psychiatrist Colin A. Ross states that based on documents obtained through freedom of information legislation, a psychiatrist linked to Project MKULTRA reported being able to deliberately induce dissociative identity disorder using a variety of highly aversive and abusive techniques, creating a Manchurian Candidate for military purposes.

In the USA Network television production &quot;Mr. Robot&quot;, the protagonist Elliot Alderson was created using anecdotal experiences of DID of the show&#x27;s creator&#x27;s friends. Sam Esmail said he consulted with a psychologist who &quot;concretized&quot; the character&#x27;s mental health conditions, especially his plurality.

In M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s &quot;Unbreakable&quot; superhero film series (specifically, the films &quot;Split&quot; and &quot;Glass&quot;), Kevin Wendell Crumb is diagnosed with DID, and that some of the personalities have super-human powers. Experts and advocates say the films are a negative portrayal of DID and the films promote the stigmatization of the disorder.

In the 1997 Japanese role-playing game &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, the protagonist Cloud Strife is shown to have an identity disorder involving false memories as a result of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Sharon Packer has identified Cloud as having DID.

In Marvel Comics, the character of Moon Knight is shown to have DID. In the TV series &quot;Moon Knight&quot; based on the comic book character, protagonist Marc Spector is depicted with DID; the website for the National Alliance on Mental Illness appears in the series&#x27; end credits. Another Marvel character, Legion, has DID in the comics, although he has schizophrenia in the TV show version, highlighting the general public&#x27;s confusion between the two distinct and separate disorders.

===Legal issues===
People with dissociative identity disorder may be involved in legal cases as a witness, defendant, or as the victim/injured party. Claims of DID have been used only rarely to argue criminal insanity in court. In the United States dissociative identity disorder has previously been found to meet the Frye test as a generally accepted medical condition, and the newer Daubert standard. Within legal circles, DID has been described as one of the most disputed psychiatric diagnoses and forensic assessments are needed. For defendants whose defense states they have a diagnosis of DID, courts must distinguish between those who genuinely have DID and those who are malingering to avoid responsibility. Expert witnesses are typically used to assess defendants in such cases, although some of the standard assessments like the MMPI-2 were not developed for people with a trauma history and the validity scales may incorrectly suggest malingering. The Multiscale Dissociation Inventory (Briere, 2002) is well suited to assessing malingering and dissociative disorders, unlike the self-report Dissociative Experiences Scale. In DID, evidence about the altered states of consciousness, actions of alter identities and episodes of amnesia may be excluded from a court if they are not considered relevant, although different countries and regions have different laws. A diagnosis of DID may be used to claim a defense of not guilty by reason of insanity, but this very rarely succeeds, or of diminished capacity, which may reduce the length of a sentence. DID may also affect competency to stand trial. A not guilty by reason of insanity plea was first used successfully in an American court in 1978, in the &quot;State of Ohio v. Milligan&quot; case. However, a DID diagnosis is not automatically considered a justification for an insanity verdict, and since Milligan the few cases claiming insanity have largely been unsuccessful.

Bennett G. Braun was an American psychiatrist known for his promotion of the concept of multiple personality disorder (now called &quot;dissociative identity disorder&quot;) and involvement in promoting the &quot;Satanic Panic&quot;, a moral panic around a discredited conspiracy theory that led to thousands of people being wrongfully medically treated or investigated for nonexistent crimes.

===Online subculture===
A DID community exists on social media, including YouTube, Reddit, Discord, and TikTok. In those contexts, the experience of dissociative identities has been called &quot;multiplicity.&quot; High-profile members of this community have been criticized for faking their condition for views, or for portraying the disorder lightheartedly. Psychologist Naomi Torres-Mackie, head of research at The Mental Health Coalition, has stated &quot;All of a sudden, all of my adolescent patients think that they have this, and they don&#x27;t ... Folks start attaching clinical meaning and feeling like, &#x27;I should be diagnosed with this. I need medication for this&#x27;, when actually a lot of these experiences are normative and don&#x27;t need to be pathologized or treated.&quot; However, online communities for DID can be beneficial. Aubrey Bakker, a neuropsychologist, says, &quot;Dissociative Identity Disorder can be extremely isolating... and [p]articipating in TikTok’s DID community can remedy some of that isolation.&quot;

===Advocacy===

Some advocates consider DID to be a form of neurodiversity, leading to advocacy in recognizing &#x27;positive plurality&#x27; and the use of plural pronouns such as &quot;we&quot; and &quot;our&quot;. Advocates also challenge the necessity of integration. Timothy Baynes argues that forcing people to undergo it as a therapeutic treatment is &quot;seriously immoral&quot;.

In 2011, author Lance Lippert wrote that most people with DID downplayed or minimized their symptoms rather than seeking fame, often due to shame or fear of the effects of stigma. Therapists may discourage people with DID from media work due to concerns that they may feel exploited or traumatized, for example as a result of demonstrating switching between personality states to entertain others. 

A DID Awareness Day takes place on March 5 annually, and a multicolored awareness ribbon is used, based on the idea of a &quot;crazy quilt&quot;.

<doc id="39657" wikidata="Q153408" url="?curid=39657" title="Joseph Banks">
<text>Sir Joseph Banks, 1st Baronet, (19 June 1820) was an English naturalist, botanist, and patron of the natural sciences.

Banks made his name on the 1766 natural-history expedition to Newfoundland and Labrador. He took part in Captain James Cook&#x27;s first great voyage (1768–1771), visiting Brazil, Tahiti, and after 6 months in New Zealand, Australia, returning to immediate fame. He held the position of president of the Royal Society for over 41 years. He advised King George III on the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, sending botanists around the world to collect plants, he made Kew the world&#x27;s leading botanical garden. He is credited for bringing 30,000 plant specimens home with him; amongst them, he was the first European to document 1,400.

Banks advocated British settlement in New South Wales and the colonisation of Australia, as well as the establishment of Botany Bay as a place for the reception of convicts, and advised the British government on all Australian matters. He is credited with introducing the eucalyptus, acacia, and the genus named after him, &quot;Banksia&quot;, to the Western world. Around 80 species of plants bear his name. He was the leading founder of the African Association and a member of the Society of Dilettanti, which helped to establish the Royal Academy.

==Early life==
Banks was born in Argyll Street, Soho, London, the son of William Banks, a wealthy Lincolnshire country squire and member of the House of Commons, and his wife Sarah, daughter of William Bate. He was baptised at St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly, on 20 February 1743, Old Style. He had a younger sister, Sarah Sophia Banks, born in 1744.

===Education===
Banks was educated at Harrow School from the age of nine and then at Eton College from 1756; the boys with whom he attended the school included his future shipmate Constantine Phipps.

As a boy, Banks enjoyed exploring the Lincolnshire countryside and developed a keen interest in nature, history, and botany. When he was 17, he was inoculated with smallpox, but he became ill and did not return to school. In late 1760, he was enrolled as a gentleman-commoner at the University of Oxford. At Oxford, he matriculated at Christ Church, where his studies were largely focussed on natural history rather than the classical curriculum. Determined to receive botanical instruction, he paid the Cambridge botanist Israel Lyons to deliver a series of lectures at Oxford in 1764.

Banks left Oxford for Chelsea in December 1763. He continued to attend the university until 1764, but left that year without taking a degree. His father had died in 1761, so when Banks reached the age of 21, he inherited the large estate of Revesby Abbey, in Lincolnshire, becoming the local squire and magistrate, and dividing his time between Lincolnshire and London. From his mother&#x27;s house in Chelsea, he kept up his interest in science by attending the Chelsea Physic Garden of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries and the British Museum, where he met the Swedish naturalist Daniel Solander. He began to make friends among the scientific men of his day and to correspond with Carl Linnaeus, whom he came to know through Solander. As Banks&#x27;s influence increased, he became an adviser to King George III and urged the monarch to support voyages of discovery to new lands, hoping to indulge his own interest in botany. He became a Freemason sometime before 1769.

==Newfoundland and Labrador==
In 1766, Banks was elected to the Royal Society, and in the same year, at 23, he went with Phipps aboard the frigate to Newfoundland and Labrador with a view to studying their natural history. He made his name by publishing the first Linnean descriptions of the plants and animals of Newfoundland and Labrador. Banks also documented 34 species of birds, including the great auk, which became extinct in 1844. On 7 May, he noted a large number of &quot;penguins&quot; swimming around the ship on the Grand Banks, and a specimen he collected in Chateau Bay, Labrador, was later identified as the great auk.

==&quot;Endeavour&quot; voyage==

Banks was appointed to a joint Royal Navy/Royal Society scientific expedition to the South Pacific Ocean on HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot;, 1768–1771. This was the first of James Cook&#x27;s voyages of discovery in that region. Banks funded eight others to join him: the Swedish naturalist Daniel Solander, the Finnish naturalist Herman Spöring (who also served as Banks&#x27;s personal secretary and as a draughtsman), artists Sydney Parkinson and Alexander Buchan, and four servants from his estate: James Roberts, Peter Briscoe, Thomas Richmond, and George Dorlton. In 1771, he was travelling with James Cook and docked in Simon&#x27;s Town in what is now South Africa. There, he met the trader Christoffel Brand and a friendship started. He was the godfather of Brand&#x27;s grandson Christoffel Brand.

The voyage went to Brazil, where Banks made the first scientific description of a now common garden plant, &quot;Bougainvillea&quot; (named after Cook&#x27;s French counterpart, Louis Antoine de Bougainville), and to other parts of South America. The voyage then progressed to Tahiti (where the transit of Venus was observed, the overt purpose of the mission), then to New Zealand.

From there, it proceeded to the east coast of Australia, where Cook mapped the coastline and made landfall at Botany Bay. The ship then landed at Round Hill (23-25 May 1770), which is now known as Seventeen Seventy and at Endeavour River (near modern Cooktown) in Queensland, where they spent almost seven weeks ashore while the ship was repaired after becoming holed on the Great Barrier Reef. While they were in Australia, Banks, Daniel Solander, and Finnish botanist Dr Herman Spöring Jr. made the first major collection of Australian flora, describing many species new to science. Almost 800 specimens were illustrated by the artist Sydney Parkinson and appear in Banks&#x27; &quot;Florilegium&quot;, finally published in 35 volumes between 1980 and 1990. Notable also was that during the period when the &quot;Endeavour&quot; was being repaired, Banks observed a kangaroo, first recorded as &quot;kanguru&quot; on 12 July 1770 in an entry in his diary.

== Return home and voyage to Iceland ==

Banks arrived back in England on 12 July 1771. He had intended to go with Cook on his second voyage, which began on 13 May 1772, but difficulties arose about Banks&#x27;s scientific requirements on board Cook&#x27;s new ship, HMS &quot;Resolution&quot;. The Admiralty regarded Banks&#x27;s demands as unacceptable and withdrew his permission to sail. Banks immediately arranged an alternative expedition, and in July 1772, Daniel Solander and he visited the Isle of Wight, the Hebrides, Iceland, and the Orkney Islands, aboard &quot;Sir Lawrence&quot;. In Iceland, they ascended Mt. Hekla and visited the Great Geyser, and were the first scientific visitors to Staffa in the Inner Hebrides. They returned to London in November, with many botanical specimens, via Edinburgh, where Banks and Solander were interviewed by James Boswell. In 1773, he toured south Wales in the company of artist Paul Sandby. When he settled in London, he began work on his &quot;Florilegium&quot;. He kept in touch with most of the scientists of his time, was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1773, and added a fresh interest when he was elected to the Dilettante Society in 1774. He was afterwards secretary of this society from 1778 to 1797. On 30 November 1778, he was elected president of the Royal Society, a position he was to hold with great distinction for over 41 years.

In March 1779, Banks married Dorothea Hugessen, daughter of W. W. Hugessen, and settled in a large house at 32 Soho Square. It continued to be his London residence for the remainder of his life. There, he welcomed the scientists, students, and authors of his period, and many distinguished foreign visitors. His sister Sarah Sophia Banks lived in the house with Banks and his wife. He had as librarian and curator of his collections Solander, Jonas Carlsson Dryander, and Robert Brown in succession.

Also in 1779, Banks took a lease on an estate called Spring Grove, the former residence of Elisha Biscoe (1705–1776), which he eventually bought outright from Biscoe&#x27;s son, also Elisha, in 1808. Its 34 acres ran along the northern side of the London Road, Isleworth, and contained a natural spring, which was an important attraction to him. Banks spent much time and effort on this secondary home. He steadily created a renowned botanical masterpiece on the estate, achieved primarily with many of the great variety of foreign plants he had collected on his extensive travels around the world, particularly to Australia and the South Seas. The surrounding district became known as Spring Grove.

The house was substantially extended and rebuilt by later owners and is now part of West Thames College.

Banks was made a baronet in 1781, three years after being elected president of the Royal Society. During much of this time, he was an informal adviser to King George III on the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, a position that was formalised in 1797. Banks dispatched explorers and botanists to many parts of the world, and through these efforts, Kew Gardens became arguably the pre-eminent botanical garden in the world, with many species being introduced to Europe through them and through Chelsea Physic Garden and their head gardener John Fairbairn. He directly fostered several famous voyages, including that of George Vancouver to the northeastern Pacific (Pacific Northwest), and William Bligh&#x27;s voyages (one entailing the infamous mutiny on the &quot;Bounty&quot;) to transplant breadfruit from the South Pacific to the Caribbean islands. Banks was also a major financial supporter of William Smith in his decade-long efforts to create a geological map of England, the first geological map of an entire country. He also chose Allan Cunningham for voyages to Brazil and the north and northwest coasts of Australia to collect specimens.

==Colonisation of New South Wales==
Banks&#x27;s own time in Australia, however, led to his interest in the British colonisation of that continent. He was to be the greatest proponent of settlement in New South Wales. A genus of the Proteaceae was named in his honour as &quot;Banksia&quot;. In 1779, Banks, giving evidence before a committee of the House of Commons, had stated that in his opinion the place most eligible for the reception of convicts &quot;was Botany Bay, on the coast of New Holland&quot;, on the general grounds that, &quot;it was not to be doubted that a Tract of Land such as New Holland, which was larger than the whole of Europe, would furnish Matter of advantageous Return&quot;.

Although Banks remained uninvolved in these colonies in a hands on manner, he was, nonetheless, the general adviser to the government on all Australian matters for twenty years. He arranged that a large number of useful trees and plants should be sent out in the supply ship , which was unfortunately wrecked, as well as other ships; many of these were supplied by Hugh Ronalds from his nursery in Brentford. Every vessel that came from New South Wales brought to Banks plants or animals or geological and other specimens and, on at least one occasion, human remains. Governor Philip Gidley King sent Banks the severed head of an Aboriginal man named Pemulwuy that Banks had seemingly listed as among his &quot;desiderata.&quot; 

He was continually called on for help in developing the agriculture and trade of the colony, and his influence was used in connection with the sending out of early free settlers, one of whom, a young gardener George Suttor, later wrote a memoir of Banks. The three earliest governors of the colony, Arthur Phillip, John Hunter, and Philip Gidley King, were in continual correspondence with him. Banks produced a significant body of papers, including one of the earliest Aboriginal Australian words lists compiled by a European. Bligh was also appointed governor of New South Wales on Banks&#x27;s recommendation. Banks followed the explorations of Matthew Flinders, George Bass, and Lieutenant James Grant, and among his paid helpers were George Caley, Robert Brown, and Allan Cunningham.

However, Banks backed William Bligh to be installed as the new governor of New South Wales and to crack down on the New South Wales Corps (or Rum Corps), which made a fortune on the trading of rum. This brought him in direct confrontation with post-Rum Rebellion &quot;de facto&quot; leaders such as John Macarthur and George Johnston. This backing led to the Rum Rebellion in Sydney, whereby the governor was overthrown by the two men. This became an embarrassment for Sir Joseph Banks, also, because years earlier, he campaigned that John Macarthur not be granted of land near Sydney in the cow pastures, which was later granted by Lord Camden. The next governor, Lachlan Macquarie, was asked to arrest Macarthur and Johnston, only to realise that they had left Sydney for London to defend themselves. He was humiliated that Macarthur and Johnston were acquitted from all charges in London and both later returned to Sydney.

==Later life==

Banks met the young Alexander von Humboldt in 1790, when Banks was already the president of the Royal Society. Before Humboldt and his scientific travel companion and collaborator Aimé Bonpland left for what became a five-year journal of exploration and discovery, Humboldt requested a British passport for Bonpland, should the two encounter British warships. On their travels, Humboldt arranged for specimens be sent to Banks, should they be seized by the British. Banks and Humboldt remained in touch until Banks&#x27;s death, aiding Humboldt by mobilising his wide network of scientific contacts to forward information to the great German scientist. Both men believed in the internationalism of science.

Banks was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1787 and a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1788. Among other activities, Banks found time to serve as a trustee of the British Museum for 42 years. He was high sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1794.

He worked with Sir George Staunton in producing the official account of the British mission to the Chinese Imperial court. This diplomatic and trade mission was headed by George, Earl Macartney. Although the Macartney Embassy returned to London without obtaining any concession from China, the mission could have been termed a success because it brought back detailed observations. This multivolume work was taken chiefly from the papers of Lord Macartney and from the papers of Sir Erasmus Gower, who was commander of the expedition. Banks was responsible for selecting and arranging engraving of the illustrations in this official record.

Banks was invested as a Knight of the Order of the Bath (KB) on 1 July 1795, which became Knight Grand Cross (GCB) when the order was restructured in 1815.

Banks was a large landowner and activist encloser, drainer and ‘improver’ in Fens at Revesby.

Banks&#x27;s health began to fail early in the 19th century and he suffered from gout every winter. After 1805, he practically lost the use of his legs and had to be wheeled to his meetings in a chair, but his mind remained as vigorous as ever. He had been a member of the Society of Antiquaries nearly all his life, and he developed an interest in archaeology in his later years. In 1807, William Kerr named the Lady Banks climbing rose after Banks&#x27;s wife. Banks was made an honorary founding member of the Wernerian Natural History Society of Edinburgh in 1808. In 1809, he became associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands. In 1809, his friend Alexander Henry dedicated his travel book to him. In May 1820, he forwarded his resignation as president of the Royal Society, but withdrew it at the request of the council. In 1819, Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen, on his First Russian Antarctic Expedition, briefly stopped in England and met Joseph Banks. Banks had sailed with James Cook 50 years earlier and supplied the Russians with books and charts for their expedition. He died on 19 June 1820 in Spring Grove House, Isleworth, London, and was buried at St Leonard&#x27;s Church, Heston. Lady Banks survived him, but they had no children.

== Legacy ==
Banks was a major supporter of the internationalist nature of science, being actively involved both in keeping open the lines of communication with continental scientists during the Napoleonic Wars, and in introducing the British people to the wonders of the wider world. He was honoured with many place names in the South Pacific: Banks Peninsula on the South Island, New Zealand; the Banks Islands in modern-day Vanuatu; the Banks Strait between Tasmania and the Furneaux Islands; Banks Island in the Northwest Territories, Canada; and the Sir Joseph Banks Group in South Australia.

The Canberra suburb of Banks, the electoral Division of Banks, and the Sydney suburbs of Bankstown, Banksia, and Banksmeadow are all named after him, as is the northern headland of Botany Bay, Cape Banks. A number of schools and colleges are also named after him, including the Sir Joseph Banks High School in the Sydney suburb of Revesby, and the Joseph Banks Secondary College opened in Perth, Western Australia in 2015.

An image of Banks was featured on the paper $5 Australian banknote from its introduction in 1967 before it was replaced by the later polymer currency.

In 1986, Banks was honoured by his portrait being depicted on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post.

In Lincoln, England, the Sir Joseph Banks Conservatory was constructed in 1989 at The Lawn, Lincoln; its tropical hot house had numerous plants related to Banks&#x27;s voyages, with samples from across the world, including Australia. The conservatory was moved to Woodside Wildlife Park in 2016 and has been named &#x27;Endeavour&#x27;. A plaque was installed in Lincoln Cathedral in his honour. In Boston, Lincolnshire, Banks was recorder for the town. His portrait, painted in 1814 by Thomas Phillips, was commissioned by the Corporation of Boston, as a tribute to one whose &#x27;judicious and active exertions improved and enriched this borough and neighbourhood&#x27;. It cost them 100 guineas. The portrait is now hanging in the Council Chamber of the Guildhall Museum.

The Sir Joseph Banks Centre is located in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, housed in a Grade II listed building, which was recently restored by the Heritage Trust of Lincolnshire to celebrate Banks&#x27;s life. Horncastle is located a few miles from Banks&#x27;s Revesby estate and the naturalist was the town&#x27;s lord of the manor. The centre is located on Bridge Street. It boasts research facilities, historic links to Australia, and a garden in which rare plants can be viewed and purchased.

At the 2011 Chelsea Flower Show, an exhibition garden celebrated the historic link between Banks and the botanical discoveries of flora and fauna on his journey through South America, Tahiti, New Zealand, and eventually Australia on Captain Cook&#x27;s ship &quot;Endeavour&quot;. The competition garden was the entry of Melbourne&#x27;s Royal Botanic Gardens with an Australian theme. It was based on the metaphorical journey of water through the continent, related to the award-winning Australian Garden at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Cranbourne. The design won a gold medal.

In 1911, London County Council marked Banks&#x27;s house at 32 Soho Square with a blue plaque. This was replaced in 1938 with a rectangular stone plaque commemorating Banks and botanists David Don and Robert Brown and meetings of the Linnean Society.

Banks appears in the historical novel &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall. He appears briefly as a contact with British naval intelligence in the historical novel &quot;Post Captain&quot;, from the Aubrey–Maturin series by Patrick O&#x27;Brian. He is also featured in Elizabeth Gilbert&#x27;s 2013 best-selling novel, &quot;The Signature of All Things&quot;, and is a major character in Martin Davies&#x27; 2005 novel &quot;The Conjuror&#x27;s Bird&quot;.

Banks&#x27;s life and influence were explored in a documentary five-part television series &quot;The Lost World of Joseph Banks&quot; in 2016.

Banks&#x27;s account of the &quot;Endeavour&#x27;s&quot; approach to Botany Bay might have been the basis for the invisible ships myth.

Herbarium specimens collected by Banks and Solander are cared for in herbaria, including at the National Herbarium of Victoria (MEL), Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria
==Dispersal of Banks&#x27;s papers==
Following Banks&#x27;s death in 1820 a &quot;treasure-trove of letters and papers&quot; was passed to Sir Edward Knatchbull, his wife&#x27;s nephew. In 1828 the latter passed bound volumes of foreign correspondence to the British Library but retained the rest of the papers in the expectation that an official biography would be written. After the death of Knatchbull and his wife, the letters and papers were passed on to their son Edward Knatchbull Hugesson, 1st Baron Brabourne, who offered to sell them to the British Museum. However, in 1884 it declined to purchase them. Following that &quot;notorious&quot; decision the Agent General of New South Wales, Sir Saul Samuel, issued instructions for the purchase of a large portion of the papers, which now form part of the State Library of New South Wales&#x27;s Brabourne Collection. The &quot;large quantities of papers&quot; which remained were then auctioned off at Sotheby&#x27;s in London in March and April 1886. One of the successful bidders was E. A. Petherick. Many of those are now in the Petherick Collection at the National Library of Australia. During the twentieth century the National Library continued to purchase Banks&#x27;s letters and papers when they came on the market.

==Online archive==
In his &quot;Endeavour&quot; journal, Banks recorded 30 years of his life. Letters, invoices, maps, regalia, and watercolour drawings have now been digitised on the State Library of NSW website. This rich research and educational tool provides access to 8800 high-quality digital images.

<text>John Galsworthy (; 14 August 1867 – 31 January 1933) was an English novelist and playwright. He is best known for his trilogy of novels collectively called &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;, and two later trilogies, &quot;A Modern Comedy&quot; and &quot;End of the Chapter&quot;. He was awarded the 1932 Nobel Prize in Literature.

Born to a prosperous upper-middle-class family, Galsworthy was destined for a career as a lawyer, but found it uncongenial and turned instead to writing. He was thirty before his first book was published in 1897, and did not achieve real success until 1906, when &quot;The Man of Property&quot;, the first of his novels about the Forsyte family was published. In the same year his first play, &quot;The Silver Box&quot; was staged in London. As a dramatist, he became known for plays with a social message, reflecting, among other themes, the struggle of workers against exploitation, the use of solitary confinement in prisons, the repression of women, jingoism and the politics and morality of war.

The Forsyte family series of novels and short stories collectively known as &quot;The Forsyte Chronicles&quot; is similar in many ways to Galsworthy&#x27;s family, and the patriarch, Old Jolyon, is modelled on Galsworthy&#x27;s father. The main sequence runs from the late 19th century to the early 1930s, featuring three generations of the family. The books were popular when first published and their latter-day popularity was boosted considerably when BBC Television broadcast a 26-part adaptation for the author&#x27;s centenary in 1967.

As well as writing plays and novels with social messages, Galsworthy campaigned continually for a wide range of causes about which he felt strongly, from animal welfare to prison reform, censorship and workers&#x27; rights. Although seen by many as a radical, he belonged to and supported no political party. His plays are seldom revived, but his novels have been frequently reissued.

==Life and career==

===Early years===

John Galsworthy was born on 14 August 1867 at his family&#x27;s home, Parkfield (now called Galsworthy House) on Kingston Hill in Surrey. He was the second child and elder son of the four children of John Galsworthy (1817–1904) and his wife Blanche Bailey &quot;née&quot; Bartleet (1837–1915). John senior was a London solicitor, with a flourishing practice, as well as substantial wealth inherited from his father – also John – who was from a Devonshire farming family. The latter had prospered as a ship chandler in Plymouth before moving to London and investing profitably in property. In the class-conscious mid-Victorian era, Blanche Galsworthy saw herself as being from a higher social stratum than her husband&#x27;s comparatively &quot;nouveau riche&quot; family, and this, together with a 20-year age gap between them, made for an uneasy relationship. The four children were considerably more &quot;en rapport&quot; with their father than with their mother. He became the model for Old Jolyon, the patriarch in &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;; looking back, Galsworthy said in 1919, &quot;I was so truly and deeply fond of him that I seemed not to have a fair share of love left to give to my mother&quot;.

Galsworthy was educated by a governess until he was nine. In 1876 he was sent to Saugeen, a small preparatory school in Bournemouth. He was happy there, and his happiness increased when his younger brother, Hubert, was sent to join him. In the summer term of 1881 Galsworthy left Saugeen to go to Harrow School. He became a member of the school football team, and captain of his house XI. A contemporary later described him as &quot;one of the best football players and runners there have ever been at Harrow ... a beautiful dribbler and full of pluck&quot;. His biographer David Holloway comments that in describing a character in a 1930 short story, Galsworthy was in fact describing his schoolboy self:

After Harrow, Galsworthy went to New College, Oxford to read law, matriculating in October 1886. His biographer Catherine Dupré calls his time at Oxford &quot;a happy, almost frivolous, interlude in a life that was lived in general with the greatest solemnity&quot;. An Oxford contemporary recalled him as living the typical life of the well-to-do, a not very intellectual undergraduate from a leading public school. He joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society, and acted in other amateur productions, in one of which he fell in love with a fellow performer, Sybil Carlisle (later a professional actress); his ardent feelings were not reciprocated, which caused him much angst. He concluded his time at Oxford with a second-class honours degree, awarded in 1889.

===Barrister and traveller===

As his father wished, Galsworthy entered the legal profession. He was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and was called to the bar in the Easter term of 1890. Holloway comments that as the son of a leading solicitor, Galsworthy was in an excellent position for a young barrister. His father could put a good deal of work his way and recommend him to other solicitors. He was nonetheless unenthusiastic about practising as a barrister. At his father&#x27;s instigation he went with his brother Hubert on a trip across Canada, ostensibly to examine some family holdings there, but, according to Holloway, chiefly as a version of the Grand Tour, to let the brothers see something of the world.

After returning to England in September 1891 Galsworthy had a brief, unhappy love affair. His father arranged further foreign trips to distract him from his emotional troubles and to develop his legal education by studying aspects of maritime law at close quarters with a view to specialising in it once back at home. In November 1892 Galsworthy and a friend from Oxford, Ted Sanderson, began a long trip that took them to the South Seas (where they hoped but failed to meet Robert Louis Stevenson in Samoa), Australasia and South Africa.

On the voyage from Adelaide to Cape Town, beginning in April 1893, Galsworthy met the ship&#x27;s first mate, Joseph Conrad, who had yet to begin his career as a writer. The two became lifelong friends. In 1904 Galsworthy went to Russia, where his father had financial interests, before returning to England, supposedly to resume his career as a barrister. He remained unenthusiastic about working as a lawyer: &quot;I read in various Chambers, practised almost not at all, and disliked my profession thoroughly&quot;. An obituarist in 1933 commented that despite Galsworthy&#x27;s distaste for the legal profession, his study of the law left a permanent mark on his fiction, in which there are numerous court scenes, mostly leading to an outcome that does more harm than good. At this stage of his life Galsworthy was under no pressure to earn a living, having an adequate allowance from his father, but although he disapproved of an idle existence, he had no clear idea of what he wished to do.

In 1895 Galsworthy began a love affair with the wife of his cousin Arthur Galsworthy. Ada Galsworthy had married Arthur in 1891, but they had little in common and quickly drifted apart; within a year they had agreed to live separately. Until the death of John Galsworthy senior in 1904, Ada and Galsworthy kept their relationship secret, because a scandal would have distressed the old man greatly. Ada encouraged Galsworthy to become a writer, as did his two sisters, Lilian (Lily) and Mabel, close friends of Ada.

===First books; marriage===

Galsworthy published his first work of fiction in 1897, when he was aged 30. It was a volume of nine short stories, &quot;From the Four Winds&quot;, printed at his own expense. The book received many favourable reviews, but sales were modest. Nevertheless, the young publisher Gerald Duckworth was willing to take a chance on Galsworthy&#x27;s second book, a novel, &quot;Jocelyn&quot;, which he published in 1898. The author later dismissed his first two books as prentice works – he called &quot;From the Four Winds&quot; &quot;that dreadful little book&quot; – and over the next few years he honed his skills. He later said that he was writing fiction for five years before he mastered even the basic techniques. He studied the works of Turgenev and Maupassant, learning from their literary craftsmanship.

While his father remained alive Galsworthy wrote under a pseudonym, John Sinjon, in whose name his first four books were published. His 1901 collection of short stories, &quot;A Man of Devon&quot;, included &quot;The Salvation of Swithin Forsyte&quot;, the first episode in what he later developed into a three-generation family saga, known collectively as &quot;The Forsyte Chronicles&quot;. Two years later he began writing &quot;The Man of Property&quot;, the first novel in the sequence.

In 1904 Galsworthy&#x27;s father died, and there was no longer any cause for secrecy about his son&#x27;s relationship with Ada. After the funeral the couple went to stay at Wingstone, a farmhouse in the village of Manaton on the edge of Dartmoor, which he had come across when on a walking tour. It was the first of many visits they made there, and four years later Galsworthy took a long lease of part of the building, which was the couple&#x27;s second home until 1923. Arthur Galsworthy sued for divorce in February 1905; the divorce was finalised on 13 September of that year and Ada married John Galsworthy ten days later. The marriage, which was childless, lasted until his death. Ada was a key figure in the life of her second husband, and his biographers have attributed to her an important influence on his development as a novelist and playwright.

===Growing fame===

&quot;The Island Pharisees&quot; (1904), addressing the effects of poverty and the constraints of convention − themes with which Galsworthy became much associated − received considerable praise, but it was a further two years until he had his first outstanding successes. His biographer V. H. Marrot calls 1906 Galsworthy&#x27;s &quot;annus mirabilis&quot;. In March his novel &quot;The Man of Property&quot; was published by William Heinemann, and in December Harley Granville-Barker directed &quot;The Silver Box&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre in London.

The novel was reviewed enthusiastically. &quot;The Times&quot; said, &quot;A novel of this character is new; it shows thought and determination, and an unflagging alertness, with its companion, ease, that make Mr Galsworthy&#x27;s career a matter of some importance to English fiction&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said that Galsworthy had already published some good work, but &quot;nothing quite so strong as this carefully-imagined and well-elaborated chapter in the history of smug respectability&quot;, and the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; commented that the characters are &quot;undeniably arresting. They always stand out of the page, clear and impressive, as true flesh and blood.&quot; Other comments included &quot;most incisive and cunningly wrought&quot;, &quot;written with a finish which is both rare and delightful&quot; and &quot;a very human story of undoubted literary value&quot;. The first impression sold out within weeks and a reprint was quickly arranged by Heinemann, who remained Galsworthy&#x27;s publisher for the rest of the author&#x27;s career. There were there four more reprints over the next five years, including a cheap &quot;Sixpenny Edition&quot;.

At this stage, Galsworthy had only tentative thoughts of expanding the novel into the family saga and social panorama of &quot;The Forsyte Chronicles&quot;. It was another twelve years before he wrote any more about the Forsytes. His novels in the interim included &quot;Fraternity&quot; (1909), a critique of the artificial veneer of urban life, and &quot;The Dark Flower&quot; (1913), depicting the disruptive, but sometimes creative, effects of love. Alongside his work as a novelist and playwright, Galsworthy was a vigorous campaigner for causes in which he believed. In 1912 and 1913 he carried on an effective campaign in the cause of humane slaughtering of animals killed for food.

&quot;The Silver Box&quot; was the first of 28 plays Galsworthy wrote for the professional stage. Despite the success of &quot;The Man of Property&quot; earlier in the year, it was as a dramatist that he was first widely known. In 1916 Sheila Kaye-Smith wrote, &quot;Galsworthy takes his place in modern literature chiefly by virtue of his plays. Criticism may to a certain extent damage him as a novelist, but the most searching critics cannot leave him anything less than a great playwright&quot;. Although throughout his career Galsworthy supported no political party, &quot;The Silver Box&quot; was seen as putting him alongside Bernard Shaw and Granville-Barker as a playwright with a strong social message. The play hinged on unequal treatment before the law, depending on social class. It was well and widely reviewed, although it did only modestly at the box-office. Between 1906 and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Galsworthy had nine plays produced and published five novels. With the help of J. M. Barrie and Gilbert Murray he set up a committee to press for reform of the British laws imposing censorship on theatrical productions. They enlisted the strong backing of William Archer and Granville-Barker; W. S. Gilbert, Arthur Pinero and others lent their support.

Not all the early plays had overt political or polemical themes: &quot;Joy&quot; (1907) is a study of a young woman&#x27;s attempts to cope with the inadequacies of her parents, and &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1913) depicts a marriage collapsing from the incompatibility of the couple. But &quot;Strife&quot; (1909) depicts the struggle of workers in a Cornish tin mine against exploitation by the employers; &quot;Justice&quot; (1910) attacks the use of solitary confinement in prisons; the theme of &quot;The Eldest Son&quot; (1912) is the repression of women both in the family and society; &quot;The Mob&quot; (1914) focuses on jingoism and the politics and morality of war. None of these plays were box-office successes, but Galsworthy had the benefit of producers—Granville-Barker and Charles Frohman in London and Annie Horniman in Manchester—who were willing to present non-commercial plays in which they believed, as well as more profitable productions.

===First World War===

When the First World War began in August 1914, Galsworthy had conflicting views. He was appalled that civilised countries should be at war with each other, but thought it right to defend Belgium against German invasion. His family was directly affected by the war: his sister Lily was married to a German, the painter Georg Sauter, who was interned as an enemy alien and later expelled. Galsworthy was too old to serve in the army and felt increasingly that he was not contributing enough to the war effort. He donated his substantial American royalties to war charities, but in addition he felt impelled to offer his services in a personal capacity. He trained as a masseur and went to France as a volunteer, giving therapy to injured soldiers at the Hôpital Bénévolé in Martouret, near Valence. His wife went with him, helping with the hospital&#x27;s laundry. They returned to England in 1917.

Revisiting the theme of the Forsyte family in 1917, Galsworthy wrote a short story, &quot;Indian Summer of a Forsyte&quot; depicting the serene final days of Old Jolyon, the head of the family in &quot;The Man of Property&quot;. It was published in the 1918 collection &quot;Five Tales&quot;, which also contained &quot;A Stoic&quot;, later to be successfully adapted for the stage as &quot;Old English&quot;.

Galsworthy resumed much of his pre-war lifestyle, combining literary output, socialising, and promoting the causes in which he believed. He supported prison reform, women&#x27;s rights, a minimum wage and animal welfare, and opposed censorship, exploitation of workers, blood sports and aerial warfare. He had included essays on some of these topics in his 1916 collection &quot;A Sheaf&quot;. Towards the end of 1917 he was offered a knighthood, which he declined, on the grounds that &quot;no artist of Letters ought to dally with titles&quot;. Officials mistakenly left his name in the published 1918 New Year Honours list, and at his insistence a correction was issued.

===Postwar===

In 1919 the American Academy of Arts and Letters invited Galsworthy to give an address at the celebrations marking the centenary of James Russell Lowell. In his speech, at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, Galsworthy praised Lowell for his contribution to making English the universal language—&quot;that most superb instrument for the making of word-music, for the telling of the truth, and the expression of the imagination.&quot;

At the St Martin&#x27;s Theatre, London, in 1920 Galsworthy had his first big box-office success with &quot;The Skin Game&quot;, depicting the clash between old and new money, attempted blackmail, and the effect of unrestrained capitalism on the lives of ordinary people. Reviews were generally favourable, although &quot;The Evening Standard&quot; said that the author&#x27;s dramatic genius lent undeserved credibility to an essentially unrealistic plot, and &quot;The Observer&quot; commented that instead of seeing the good in both sides of an argument as he usually did, Galsworthy here depicted the bad in both. Archer wrote that the play contained some of the most thrilling passages in modern drama, and showed Galsworthy to be a born dramatist. Another reviewer called it &quot;unrivalled among present productions ... the finest play London has seen for years.&quot; The success of the play quickly led to a Broadway production and a film version featuring the West End cast, headed by Edmund Gwenn.

By this time Galsworthy had returned to the Forsytes; he wrote a second novel about the family, &quot;In Chancery&quot;, published in October 1920. Within a year he completed another Forsyte short story (or &quot;interlude&quot;), called &quot;Awakening&quot;, and a third novel, &quot;To Let&quot;, published in September 1921. A month later the International PEN Club (standing for &quot;Poets, Essayists, Novelists&quot;) was founded in London, with Galsworthy as its president, a position he held for the rest of his life. In May 1922, the three Forsyte novels were issued in a single volume as &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;, and sold prodigiously—more than two million copies within months of publication, according to one account, although Galsworthy&#x27;s major biographers do not give a figure.

Having concluded &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;, Galsworthy turned to the next generation of the family. The first instalment of a second trilogy—&quot;The White Monkey&quot;—was published in October 1924, a few days after the premiere of Galsworthy&#x27;s drama, &quot;Old English&quot;. The starring role in the play, Sylvanus Heythorpe, was played in London by Norman McKinnel and in New York by George Arliss. The latter starred in a film adaptation in 1930. The day before the play opened in London, Lily Sauter died. The Galsworthys took her son Rudolf and his wife, Viola, with them for a prolonged winter holiday in Italy and North Africa.

===Later years===

Galsworthy&#x27;s lease of Wingstone ended in 1923, to his regret and his wife&#x27;s relief (she found the Devon weather bad for her bronchitis). They were without a country home for three years until in September 1926 they discovered and bought Bury House in Bury, West Sussex, a village off the A29, four miles north of Arundel. The house has extensive views across farmland to the South Downs, where Galsworthy used to ride. At Bury the Galsworthys entertained his friends and colleagues, including Arnold Bennett and Hugh Walpole; the latter was much taken with the house: &quot;really lovely, with pearl-grey stone fronting lawns that run straight to the open fields ... Everything artistic ... Very like a special edition of one of John&#x27;s own books&quot;. Galsworthy and Ada divided their time between Bury and their London home in Hampstead; Rudolf and Viola Sauter moved from London and lived at Bury House the year round.

Between 1926 and 1928 Galsworthy worked on the second Forsyte trilogy. &quot;The Silver Spoon&quot; was published in 1926 and &quot;Swan Song&quot; in 1928. He interspersed the novels with two short &quot;interludes&quot;: &quot;A Silent Wooing&quot; (1926) and &quot;Passers By&quot; (1927). They were published in a single volume as &quot;A Modern Comedy&quot; in 1929. Sales were disappointing—fewer than those of &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; as a single volume seven years earlier.

In 1929 Galsworthy was offered the Order of Merit. Although it is a more prestigious honour than a knighthood, it confers no title, and Galsworthy accepted it, receiving the award along with the Poet Laureate, Robert Bridges. Over the following three years he received honorary degrees from five universities, including Oxford, where he delivered the 1931 Romanes Lecture taking as his subject &quot;Shakespeare and Spiritual Life&quot;.

Galsworthy found himself drawn back to the Forsyte family, and in 1930 he published &quot;On Forsyte &#x27;Change&quot;, a collection of short stories about them, dealing with events before and soon after those recorded in the &quot;Saga&quot;. In his foreword he wrote, &quot;it is hard to part suddenly and finally from those with whom one has lived so long; and ... these footnotes do really, I think, help to fill in and round out the chronicles of the Forsyte family&quot;. In 1931 he began what developed into a third and last trilogy, with &quot;Maid in Waiting&quot;, followed by &quot;Flowering Wilderness&quot; (1932) and the posthumously published &quot;Over the River&quot; (1933). This final trilogy, published together as &quot;End of the Chapter&quot; in 1935, moves the focus towards the Charwell family, related by marriage to the Forsytes. It sold well, although not matching the commercial or critical success of the &quot;Saga&quot;.

Galsworthy&#x27;s health declined as he was working on &quot;Over the River&quot;, and, hitherto a fluent writer, he found progress slow and effortful. In late 1932 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, only the second English author to receive the award since its inception in 1901. The citation for Galsworthy&#x27;s award was &quot;for his distinguished art of narration which takes its highest form in &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;&quot;. He was by then too ill to go to Stockholm for the presentation, and died at his London home on 31 January 1933, aged 65, from a combination of causes including cerebral thrombosis, arterial sclerosis and a possible brain tumour.

After a private funeral and cremation, a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey, attended by members of the Cabinet including the prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, European ambassadors, fellow authors including Sir James Barrie, Laurence Binyon, Walter de la Mare and Sir Arthur Pinero, and representatives of numerous charities that Galsworthy had supported. In accordance with his will, his ashes were scattered from an aeroplane over the South Downs.

==Works==

Galsworthy wrote 20 novels; 28 completed plays; five collections of short stories; three volumes of poetry; eleven volumes of essays and sketches; and occasional stories and pamphlets, newspaper articles, unpublished essays and sketches. He wrote in longhand, revised extensively, and his wife—the only secretary he ever had—typed his completed manuscripts.

===Novels===

Of Galsworthy&#x27;s 20 novels, nine are about the Forsytes, the last three tangentially so, and the other eleven are all one-off stories. In a 1982 study, Alec Fréchet analyses a comment that Galsworthy made in looking back at his works in the mid-1920s, that the novels reflected the battle between the emotional and critical sides of his nature:

From this, Fréchet divides the novels into five periods: the first consisting of the two early ones, &quot;Jocelyn&quot; (1898) and &quot;Villa Rubein&quot; (1900). Between 1901 and 1909 there were four novels characterised as &quot;critical&quot;—&quot;The Island Pharisees&quot; (1904), &quot;The Man of Property&quot; (1906), &quot;The Country House&quot; (1907) and &quot;Fraternity&quot; (1909). These books reflect the author&#x27;s disparaging view of various aspects of British society, such as hypocrisy, selfishness and exploitation of the poor and women of all classes. His censure was seen in conservative circles as scandalous, and the author was regarded by some as a traitor to his own class. He further offended conservatives by his attacks on imperialism; in &quot;The Island Pharisees&quot; he wrote, &quot;Why should we, a small portion of the world&#x27;s population, assume that our standards are the proper ones for every kind of race?&quot;

The next period, from 1910 to 1919, produced six novels categorised as &quot;lyrical&quot; or &quot;war-time&quot;: &quot;The Patrician&quot; (1911), &quot;The Dark Flower&quot; (1913), &quot;The Freelands&quot; (1915), &quot;Beyond&quot; (1917), &quot;The Burning Spear&quot; (1919) and &quot;Saint&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1919). After these Fréchet lists the 1920–1928 Forsyte novels as a category of their own: &quot;In Chancery&quot; (1920), &quot;To Let&quot; (1921), &quot;The White Monkey&quot; (1924), &quot;The Silver Spoon&quot; (1926) and &quot;Swan Song&quot; (1928). The last group in Fréchet&#x27;s summary of Galsworthy&#x27;s classifications consists of the final trilogy: &quot;Maid in Waiting&quot; (1931), &quot;Flowering Wilderness&quot; (1932) and &quot;Over the River&quot; (completed in 1932).

Fréchet comments that the recurring themes of Galsworthy&#x27;s novels are, in order of importance: beauty, love and suffering, divorce, honour, art and the law. &quot;Beauty comes first, because in every case it coincides with love: the beloved woman is always very beautiful; but not only women: the natural setting for the action is also unfailingly lovely. The beauty of a woman and the beauty of nature are of the same kind.&quot; Money and family are important features, but generally as the background to, rather than the crux of, the plot.

===Plays===

Like his contemporary Somerset Maugham, Galsworthy was known more in his early career for his plays than for his novels. Unlike Maugham, who abandoned the theatre thirty years before the end of his writing career, Galsworthy continued writing plays, from &quot;The Silver Box&quot; in 1906 to &quot;The Roof&quot; in 1929. As with Maugham, the plays are rarely revived, although the Forsyte Saga and some other novels have been regularly reissued.

As a playwright, Galsworthy presented social issues of the time in the manner of the modernist school of Henrik Ibsen. Encouraged by Granville-Barker, Galsworthy wrote about conflicts and inequities within British society. Shaw did the same, but the styles of the two dramatists differed noticeably. &quot;The Times&quot; commented that Galsworthy was a dramatist of power with more feeling than Shaw, if less wit, &quot;and as keen a sense of social anomalies, if less readiness to offer theories by which they might be remedied.&quot; Shaw favoured a forthright presentation of his themes; Galsworthy and Granville-Barker preferred a more subtle, naturalistic approach, which, Shaw said, &quot;makes me blush for the comparative blatancy of my own plays&quot;. Galsworthy seldom took sides; he was known for seeing both sides of most arguments and rarely giving any characters a monopoly of virtue or wisdom. The literary critic and academic Michael Molino summarises Galsworthy&#x27;s technique:

Not all Galsworthy&#x27;s plays are of this kind. Two were his adaptations of earlier short stories: &quot;The First and the Last&quot; (1921) and &quot;Old English&quot; (1924), which dealt respectively with murder and suicide—the latter by the unconventional method of overeating: the play culminates in the death of the central character, who, faced with imminent ruin and disgrace, defies his doctor&#x27;s orders and deliberately eats a fatally rich and elaborate dinner, with many courses and as many wines. These were exceptions: normally Galsworthy conceived his plots and characters as suitable either for drama or for fiction, but not both.

Some critics felt that Galsworthy was apt to show the underdog in a sympathetic light even when the character deserved little sympathy. &quot;Windows&quot; (1923), centring on a vicious young woman, led the reviewer in &quot;The Times&quot; to quote Samuel Johnson: &quot;Sir, do not accustom your mind to confound virtue and vice.&quot;

===Other writing===

Galsworthy was an accomplished writer of short stories; the most popular collection is &quot;Five Tales&quot; (1918). Opinions vary about his poetry. In &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; (2004), Geoffrey Harvey considers that Galsworthy&#x27;s poems rarely transcend the conventional. Gilbert Murray thought that the &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, posthumously published, showed that Galsworthy could have been a considerable poet if he had not already found his milieu in prose.

Harvey judges Galsworthy&#x27;s essays and published lectures to be &quot;thoughtful but unremarkable&quot;.

==Honours==

In addition to the Order of Merit and the Nobel Prize, Galsworthy received honorary degrees from the universities of Cambridge, Dublin, Manchester, Oxford, Princeton, Sheffield and St Andrews, and was an honorary fellow of New College, Oxford.

==Reputation==

Galsworthy was known for his generosity. He insisted on living on only half his income, and gave the other half away in such causes as providing affordable homes for villagers in Manaton and Bury. Walpole described him as &quot;gentle, honest and just&quot; and &quot;absolutely good-hearted ... a dear&quot;, although somewhat over-serious: &quot;A dinner with Galsworthy, Lucas, and Granville-Barker was quite fun although J. G. never sees a joke&quot;. P. G. Wodehouse confirmed this reputation for seriousness; he wrote that Galsworthy abominated desultory conversation, and when he and his wife were entertaining dinner guests he would announce, as they sat down, a topic that would be discussed during the meal, such as &quot;To what extent is genius influenced by the educational standards of parents?&quot;

The literary modernists of his day deplored Galsworthy&#x27;s books, and those of his contemporaries H. G. Wells and Arnold Bennett. Virginia Woolf called them &quot;the Edwardians&quot; and accused them of presiding over an &quot;age when character disappeared or was mysteriously engulfed&quot;. In her view, according to Molino, the three &quot;ignored the complex internal life of characters&quot; and portrayed &quot;an orderly existence populated with characters typical of their social station, but little else.&quot; Of the three it was Galsworthy whom Woolf most disliked. When his death was announced she wrote of her thankfulness that &quot;that stuffed shirt&quot; had died. In 1927 D. H. Lawrence, although, in Fréchet&#x27;s phrase, &quot;undaunted by his lack of knowledge of the subject&quot;, published an attack on Galsworthy. &quot;The story is feeble, the characters have no blood and bones, the emotions are faked, faked, faked. It is one great fake.&quot;

The publisher Rupert Hart-Davis thought that Galsworthy&#x27;s touch grew less sure with each succeeding generation of the Forsytes: in the &quot;Saga&quot; the author could draw on his contemporaries and immediate forebears as models: the Forsytes are an upper-middle-class family like Galsworthy&#x27;s own, two generations removed from their yeomen roots in the West Country; Ada&#x27;s first marriage provided a basis for Irene and Soames Forsyte. But in Hart-Davis&#x27;s view, in the later novels Galsworthy had to rely on his creative imagination, &quot;which by itself wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to mask his ignorance of his juniors: perhaps if he&#x27;d had children the later books would have rung truer.&quot;

In his 1979 study &quot;John Galsworthy: l&#x27;homme, le romancier, le critique social&quot;, Fréchet wrote that Galsworthy&#x27;s reputation is not the same in Britain as it is elsewhere: &quot;for the English, Galsworthy represents the past, because they are so conscious of all that is anachronistic in the world he describes, and of how fast it is all changing.&quot; Fréchet suggests that readers from other countries &quot;are much better at perceiving what remains true in Galsworthy&#x27;s depiction of England, because they realise how slowly it has changed.&quot;

Marking the centenary of Galsworthy&#x27;s birth, the BBC made a television adaptation of the first two trilogies, screened in 1967 under the title &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;. It was at the time the most expensive television production ever made, with 26 episodes of 50 minutes each. It attracted large audiences in Britain and forty other countries, and led to a surge in the sale of Galsworthy&#x27;s novels, which sold better than at any stage in his lifetime; Penguin Books sold more than 100,000 copies of &quot;The Man of Property&quot; in Britain in 1967 and more than 120,000 the following year. New translations brought the author a new international public.

<text>Pope BenedictXVI (; ; ; born Joseph Alois Ratzinger, ; 16 April 1927 – 31 December 2022) was head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State from 19 April 2005 until his resignation on 28 February 2013. Benedict&#x27;s election as pope occurred in the 2005 papal conclave that followed the death of Pope John Paul II. Upon his resignation, Benedict chose to be known as &quot;Pope emeritus&quot;, and he retained this title until his death in 2022.

Ordained as a priest in 1951 in his native Bavaria, Ratzinger embarked on an academic career and established himself as a highly regarded theologian by the late 1950s. He was appointed a full professor in 1958 at the age of 31. After a long career as a professor of theology at several German universities, he was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising and created a cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1977, an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience. In 1981, he was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, one of the most important dicasteries of the Roman Curia. From 2002 until he was elected pope, he was also Dean of the College of Cardinals. Before becoming pope, he had been &quot;a major figure on the Vatican stage for a quarter of a century&quot;; he had had an influence &quot;second to none when it came to setting church priorities and directions&quot; as one of John Paul II&#x27;s closest confidants.

Benedict&#x27;s writings were prolific and generally defended traditional Catholic doctrine, values, and liturgy. He was originally a liberal theologian but adopted conservative views after 1968. During his papacy, Benedict advocated a return to fundamental Christian values to counter the increased secularisation of many Western countries. He viewed relativism&#x27;s denial of objective truth, and the denial of moral truths in particular, as the central problem of the 21st century. Benedict also revived several traditions and permitted greater use of the Tridentine Mass. He strengthened the relationship between the Catholic Church and art, promoted the use of Latin, and reintroduced traditional papal vestments, for which reason he was called &quot;the pope of aesthetics&quot;. He also established personal ordinariates for former Anglicans and Methodists joining the Catholic Church. Benedict&#x27;s handling of sexual abuse cases within the Catholic Church and opposition to usage of condoms in areas of high HIV transmission was substantially criticised by public health officials, anti-AIDS activists, and victim&#x27;s rights organizations.

On 11 February 2013, Benedict announced his (effective 28 February 2013) resignation, citing a &quot;lack of strength of mind and body&quot; due to his advanced age. His resignation was the first by a pope since Gregory XII in 1415, and the first without external pressure since Celestine V in 1294. He was succeeded by Francis on 13 March 2013 and moved into the newly renovated Mater Ecclesiae Monastery in Vatican City for his retirement. In addition to his native German language, Benedict had some level of proficiency in French, Italian, English, and Spanish. He also knew Portuguese, Latin, Biblical Hebrew, and Biblical Greek. He was a member of several social science academies, such as the French Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques. 

== Early life: 1927–1951 ==

Joseph Alois Ratzinger was born on 16 April, Holy Saturday, 1927 at Schulstraße 11 at 8:30 in the morning in his parents&#x27; home in Marktl, Bavaria, Germany. He was baptised the same day. He was the third and youngest child of Joseph Ratzinger Sr., a police officer, and Maria Ratzinger (); his grand-uncle was the German priest-politician Georg Ratzinger. His mother&#x27;s family was originally from South Tyrol (now in Italy). Benedict&#x27;s elder brother, Georg, became a Catholic priest and was the former director of the Regensburger Domspatzen choir. His sister, Maria, who never married, managed her brother Joseph&#x27;s household until she died in 1991.

At the age of five, Ratzinger was in a group of children who welcomed the visiting Cardinal Archbishop of Munich, Michael von Faulhaber, with flowers. Struck by the cardinal&#x27;s distinctive garb, he announced later that day that he wanted to be a cardinal. He attended the elementary school in Aschau am Inn, which was renamed in his honour in 2009. In 1939, aged 12, he enrolled in a minor seminary in Traunstein. This period lasted until the seminary was closed for military use in 1942, and the students were all sent home. Ratzinger returned to Traunstein.

=== Wartime and ordination ===
Ratzinger&#x27;s family, especially his father, bitterly resented the Nazis, and his father&#x27;s opposition to Nazism resulted in demotions and harassment of the family. Following his 14th birthday in 1941, Ratzinger was conscripted into the Hitler Youthas membership was required by law for all 14-year-old German boys after March 1939but was an unenthusiastic member who refused to attend meetings, according to his brother. In 1941, one of Ratzinger&#x27;s cousins, a 14-year-old boy with Down syndrome, was taken away by the Nazi regime and murdered during the &quot;Aktion T4&quot; campaign of Nazi eugenics. In 1943, while still in seminary, he was drafted into the German anti-aircraft corps as Luftwaffenhelfer. Ratzinger then trained in the German infantry. As the Allied front drew closer to his post in 1945, he deserted back to his family&#x27;s home in Traunstein after his unit had ceased to exist, just as American troops established a headquarters in the Ratzinger household. As a German soldier, he was interned in US prisoner of war camps, first in Neu-Ulm, then at Fliegerhorst (&quot;military airfield&quot;) Bad Aibling (shortly to be repurposed as Bad Aibling Station) where he was at the time of Victory in Europe Day, and released on 19 June 1945.

Ratzinger and his brother Georg entered Saint Michael Seminary in Traunstein in November 1945, later studying at the Ducal Georgianum () of the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich. They were both ordained in Freising on 29 June 1951 by Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber of Munichthe same man Ratzinger had met as a child. He recalled: &quot;at the moment the elderly Archbishop laid his hands on me, a little birdperhaps a larkflew up from the altar in the high cathedral and trilled a little joyful song&quot;. He celebrated his first Mass later that summer in Traunstein, at St. Oswald&#x27;s Church.

Ratzinger&#x27;s 1953 dissertation was on Augustine of Hippo and was titled &quot;The People and the House of God in Augustine&#x27;s Doctrine of the Church&quot;. His habilitation (which qualified him for a professorship) was on Bonaventure. It was completed in 1957 and he became a professor at Freising College in 1958.

=== Encounter with Romano Guardini ===
In his early twenties, Ratzinger was deeply influenced by the thought of Italian German philosopher Romano Guardini, who taught in Munich from 1946 to 1951 when Ratzinger was studying in Freising and later at the University of Munich. The intellectual affinity between these two thinkers, who would later become decisive figures for the twentieth-century Catholic Church, was preoccupied with rediscovering the essentials of Christianity: Guardini wrote his 1938 &quot;The Essence of Christianity&quot;, while Ratzinger penned &quot;Introduction to Christianity&quot;, three decades later in 1968. Guardini inspired many in the Catholic social-democratic tradition, particularly the Communion and Liberation movement in the New Evangelization encouraged under the papacy of the Polish Pope John Paul II. Ratzinger wrote an introduction to a 1996 reissue of Guardini&#x27;s 1954 &quot;The Lord&quot;.

== Pre-papal career: 1951–2005 ==

=== Academic career: 1951–1977 ===

Ratzinger began as assistant pastor (curate) at the parish St. Martin, Moosach, in Munich in 1951. Ratzinger became a professor at the University of Bonn in 1959, with his inaugural lecture on &quot;The God of Faith and the God of Philosophy&quot;. In 1963, he moved to the University of Münster. During this period, he participated in the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) and served as a &quot;peritus&quot; (theological consultant) to Cardinal Frings of Cologne. He was viewed during the time of the council as a reformer, cooperating with theologians like Hans Küng and Edward Schillebeeckx. Ratzinger became an admirer of Karl Rahner, a well-known academic theologian of the &quot;Nouvelle théologie&quot; and a proponent of Church reform.

In 1966, Ratzinger was appointed to a chair in dogmatic theology at the University of Tübingen, where he was a colleague of Hans Küng. In his 1968 book &quot;Introduction to Christianity&quot;, he wrote that the pope has a duty to hear differing voices within the Church before making a decision, and he downplayed the centrality of the papacy. During this time, he distanced himself from the atmosphere of Tübingen and the Marxist leanings of the student movement of the 1960s that quickly radicalized, in the years 1967 and 1968, culminating in a series of disturbances and riots in April and May 1968. Ratzinger came increasingly to see these and associated developments (such as decreasing respect for authority among his students) as connected to a departure from traditional Catholic teachings. Despite his reformist bent, his views increasingly came to contrast with the liberal ideas gaining currency in theological circles. He was invited by Rev. Theodore Hesburgh to join the theology faculty at the University of Notre Dame, but declined on grounds that his English was not good enough.

Some voices, among them Küng, deemed this period in Ratzinger&#x27;s life a turn towards conservatism, while Ratzinger himself said in a 1993 interview, &quot;I see no break in my views as a theologian [over the years]&quot;. Ratzinger continued to defend the work of the Second Vatican Council, including &quot;Nostra aetate&quot;, the document on respect of other religions, ecumenism, and the declaration of the right to freedom of religion. Later, as the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Ratzinger most clearly spelled out the Catholic Church&#x27;s position on other religions in the 2000 document &quot;Dominus Iesus&quot; which also talks about the Catholic way to engage in &quot;ecumenical dialogue&quot;. During his time at Tübingen University, Ratzinger published articles in the reformist theological journal &quot;Concilium&quot;, though he increasingly chose less reformist themes than other contributors such as Küng and Schillebeeckx.

In 1969, Ratzinger returned to Bavaria, to the University of Regensburg and co-founded the theological journal &quot;Communio&quot;, with Hans Urs von Balthasar, Henri de Lubac, Walter Kasper, and others, in 1972. &quot;Communio&quot;, now published in seventeen languages, including German, English, and Spanish, has become a prominent journal of contemporary Catholic theological thought. Until he was elected pope, he remained one of the journal&#x27;s most prolific contributors. In 1976, he suggested that the Augsburg Confession might be recognised as a Catholic statement of faith. Several of Benedict&#x27;s former students became his confidantes, notably Christoph Schönborn, and a number of his former students sometimes meet for discussions. He served as vice-president of the University of Regensburg from 1976 to 1977. On 26 May 1976, he was appointed a Prelate of Honour of His Holiness.

=== Archbishop of Munich and Freising: 1977–1982 ===
On 24 March 1977, Ratzinger was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising, and was ordained a bishop on 28 May. He took as his episcopal motto (Latin for &#x27;cooperators of the truth&#x27;), from the Third Epistle of John, a choice on which he commented in his autobiographical work &quot;Milestones&quot;.

In the consistory of 27 June 1977, he was named Cardinal Priest of Santa Maria Consolatrice al Tiburtino by Pope Paul VI. By the time of the 2005 conclave, he was one of only fourteen remaining cardinals appointed by PaulVI, and one of only three of those under the age of 80. Of these, only he and William Wakefield Baum took part in the conclave.

=== Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: 1981–2005 ===
On 25 November 1981, Pope John PaulII, upon the retirement of Franjo Šeper, named Ratzinger as the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, formerly known as the &quot;Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office&quot;, the historical Roman Inquisition. Consequently, he resigned from his post in Munich in early 1982. He was promoted within the College of Cardinals to become Cardinal Bishop of Velletri-Segni in 1993 and was made the college&#x27;s vice-dean in 1998 and dean in 2002. Just a year after its foundation in 1990, Ratzinger joined the European Academy of Sciences and Arts in Salzburg.
Ratzinger defended and reaffirmed Catholic doctrine, including teaching on topics such as birth control, homosexuality, and inter-religious dialogue. The theologian Leonardo Boff, for example, was suspended, while others such as Matthew Fox were censured. Other issues also prompted condemnations or revocations of rights to teach: for instance, some posthumous writings of Jesuit priest Anthony de Mello were the subject of a notification. Ratzinger and the congregation viewed many of them, particularly the later works, as having an element of religious indifferentism (in other words, that Christ was &quot;one master alongside others&quot;). In particular, &quot;Dominus Iesus&quot;, published by the congregation in the jubilee year 2000, reaffirmed many recently &quot;unpopular&quot; ideas, including the Catholic Church&#x27;s position that &quot;salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.&quot; The document angered many Protestant churches by claiming that they are not churches, but &quot;ecclesial communities&quot;.

Ratzinger&#x27;s 2001 letter &quot;De delictis gravioribus&quot; clarified the confidentiality of internal church investigations, as defined in the 1962 document &quot;Crimen sollicitationis&quot;, into accusations made against priests of certain crimes, including sexual abuse. This became a subject of controversy during the sex abuse cases. For 20 years, Ratzinger had been the man in charge of enforcing the document.

While bishops hold the secrecy pertained only internally, and did not preclude investigation by civil law enforcement, the letter was often seen as promoting a coverup. Later, as pope, he was accused in a lawsuit of conspiring to cover up the molestation of three boys in Texas, but sought and obtained diplomatic immunity from liability.

On 12 March 1983, Ratzinger, as prefect, notified the lay faithful and the clergy that Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục had incurred excommunication &quot;latae sententiae&quot; for illicit episcopal consecrations without the apostolic mandate. It is reported that in 1997, when he turned 70, Ratzinger asked Pope John PaulII for permission to leave the Congregation of the Doctrine of Faith and to become instead the head of the Vatican Secret Archives and of the Vatican Library, but John Paul refused his assent.

Ratzinger engaged in a dialogue with critical theorist Jürgen Habermas in 2004, published three years later by Ignatius Press.

==Papacy: 2005–2013==


===Election to the papacy===
In April 2005, before his election as pope, Ratzinger was identified as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by &quot;Time&quot;. While Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Ratzinger repeatedly stated he would like to retire to his house in the Bavarian village of Pentling near Regensburg and dedicate himself to writing books.

At the papal conclave, &quot;it was, if not Ratzinger, who? And as they came to know him, the question became, why not Ratzinger?&quot; On 19 April 2005, he was elected on the second day after four ballots. Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O&#x27;Connor described the final vote, &quot;It&#x27;s very solemn when you go up one by one to put your vote in the urn and you&#x27;re looking up at the &quot;Last Judgement&quot; of Michelangelo. And I still remember vividly the then Cardinal Ratzinger sitting on the edge of his chair.&quot; Ratzinger had hoped to retire peacefully and said that &quot;At a certain point, I prayed to God &#x27;please don&#x27;t do this to me&#x27;...Evidently, this time He didn&#x27;t listen to me.&quot;

The day following Ratzinger&#x27;s election, the German newspaper Bild ran what would become one of its most iconic headlines in response to the announcement of the prior day, Wir Sind Papst (&quot;We are Pope&quot;).

At the balcony, Benedict&#x27;s first words to the crowd, given in Italian before he gave the traditional &quot;Urbi et Orbi&quot; blessing in Latin, were:

On 24 April, Benedict celebrated the Papal Inauguration Mass in St. Peter&#x27;s Square, during which he was invested with the Pallium and the Ring of the Fisherman. On 7 May, he took possession of his cathedral church, the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran.

=== Choice of name ===
BenedictXVI chose his papal name, which comes from the Latin word meaning &quot;the blessed&quot;, in honour of both Benedict XV and Benedict of Nursia. BenedictXV was pope during the First World War, during which time he passionately pursued peace between the warring nations. St. Benedict of Nursia was the founder of the Benedictine monasteries (most monasteries of the Middle Ages were of the Benedictine order) and the author of the &quot;Rule of Saint Benedict&quot;, which is still the most influential writing regarding the monastic life of Western Christianity. The Pope explained his choice of name during his first general audience in St. Peter&#x27;s Square, on 27 April 2005:

=== Tone of papacy ===
During Benedict&#x27;s inaugural Mass, the previous custom of every cardinal submitting to the pope was replaced by being greeted by twelve people, including cardinals, clergy, religious, a married couple and their child, and some who were newly confirmed people; the cardinals had formally sworn their obedience upon the election of the new pontiff. He began using an open-topped papal car, saying that he wanted to be closer to the people. Benedict continued the tradition of his predecessor John PaulII and baptised several infants in the Sistine Chapel at the beginning of each year, on the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord, in his pastoral role as Bishop of Rome.

==== Beatifications ====

During his pontificate, BenedictXVI beatified 870 people. On 9 May 2005, BenedictXVI began the beatification process for his predecessor, Pope John PaulII. Normally, five years must pass after a person&#x27;s death before the beatification process can begin. However, in an audience with Benedict, Camillo Ruini, vicar general of the Diocese of Rome and the official responsible for promoting the cause for canonization of any person who dies within that diocese, cited &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; which suggested that the waiting period could be waived. (This had happened before, when Pope PaulVI waived the five-year rule and announced beatification processes for two of his own predecessors, Pope Pius XII and Pope John XXIII. BenedictXVI followed this precedent when he waived the five-year rule for John PaulII.) The decision was announced on 13 May 2005, the Feast of Our Lady of Fátima and the 24th anniversary of the attempt on John PaulII&#x27;s life. John PaulII often credited Our Lady of Fátima for preserving him on that day. Cardinal Ruini inaugurated the diocesan phase of the cause for beatification in the Lateran Basilica on 28 June 2005.

The first beatification under the new pope was celebrated on 14 May 2005, by José Cardinal Saraiva Martins, Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. The new Blesseds were Marianne Cope and Ascensión Nicol Goñi. Cardinal Clemens August Graf von Galen was beatified on 9 October 2005. Mariano de la Mata was beatified in November 2006 and Rosa Eluvathingal was beatified on 3 December of that year, and Basil Moreau was beatified in September 2007. In October 2008, the following beatifications took place: Celestine of the Mother of God, Giuseppina Nicoli, Hendrina Stenmanns, Maria Rosa Flesch, Marta Anna Wiecka, Michael Sopocko, Petrus Kibe Kasui and 187 Companions, Susana Paz-Castillo Ramírez, and Maria Isbael Salvat Romero.

On 19 September 2010, during his visit to the United Kingdom, Benedict personally proclaimed the beatification of John Henry Newman.

Unlike his predecessor, Benedict delegated the beatification liturgical service to a cardinal. On 29 September 2005, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued a communiqué announcing that henceforth beatifications would be celebrated by a representative of the pope, usually the prefect of that Congregation.

==== Canonizations ====
During his pontificate, BenedictXVI canonized 45 people. He celebrated his first canonizations on 23 October 2005 in St. Peter&#x27;s Square when he canonized Josef Bilczewski, Alberto Hurtado, Zygmunt Gorazdowski, Gaetano Catanoso, and Felice da Nicosia. The canonizations were part of a mass that marked the conclusion of the General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops and the Year of the Eucharist. Benedict canonized Bishop Rafael Guízar y Valencia, Théodore Guérin, Filippo Smaldone, and Rosa Venerini on 15 October 2006.

During his visit to Brazil in 2007, Benedict presided over the canonization of Frei Galvão on 11 May, while George Preca, founder of the Malta-based , Szymon of Lipnica, Charles of Mount Argus, and Marie-Eugénie de Jésus were canonized in a ceremony held at the Vatican on 3 June 2007. Preca is the first Maltese saint since the country&#x27;s conversion to Christianity in A.D. 60 when St. Paul converted the inhabitants. In October 2008, the following canonizations took place: Alphonsa of the Immaculate Conception of India, Gaetano Errico, Narcisa de Jesus Martillo Moran, and Maria Bernarda Bütler. In April 2009, the Pope canonized Arcangelo Tadini, Bernardo Tolomei, Nuno Álvares Pereira, Geltrude Comensoli, and Caterina Volpicelli. In October of the same year he canonized Jeanne Jugan, Damien de Veuster, Zygmunt Szczęsny Feliński, Francisco Coll Guitart, and Rafael Arnáiz Barón.

On 17 October 2010, Benedict canonized André Bessette, a French-Canadian; Stanisław Sołtys, a 15th-century Polish priest; Italian nuns Giulia Salzano and Camilla Battista da Varano; Spanish nun Candida Maria de Jesus Cipitria y Barriola; and the first Australian saint, Mary MacKillop. On 23 October 2011, he canonized three saints: a Spanish nun Bonifacia Rodríguez y Castro, Italian archbishop Guido Maria Conforti, and Italian priest Luigi Guanella. In December 2011, the Pope formally recognized the validity of the miracles necessary to proceed with the canonizations of Kateri Tekakwitha, who would be the first Native American saint; Marianne Cope, a nun working with lepers in what is now the state of Hawaii; Giovanni Battista Piamarta, an Italian priest; Jacques Berthieu, a French Jesuit priest and African martyr; Carmen Salles y Barangueras, a Spanish nun and founder of the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception; Peter Calungsod, a lay catechist and martyr from the Philippines; and Anna Schäffer, whose desire to be a missionary was unfulfilled on account of her illness. They were canonized on 21 October 2012.

==== Doctors of the Church ====
On 7 October 2012, Benedict named Hildegard of Bingen and John of Ávila as Doctors of the Church, the 34th and 35th individuals so recognized in the history of Christianity.

=== Curia reform ===
Benedict made only modest changes to the structure of the Roman Curia. In March 2006, he placed both the Pontifical Council for Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant Peoples and the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace under a single president, Cardinal Renato Martino. When Martino retired in 2009, each council received its own president once again. Also in March 2006, the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue was briefly merged into the Pontifical Council for Culture under Cardinal Paul Poupard. Those Councils maintained their separate officials and staffs while their status and competencies continued unchanged, and in May 2007, Interreligious Dialogue was restored to its separate status again with its own president. In June 2010, Benedict created the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelization, appointing Archbishop Rino Fisichella its first president. On 16 January 2013, the Pope transferred responsibility for catechesis from the Congregation for the Clergy to the Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization.

=== Teachings ===
As pope, one of Benedict&#x27;s main roles was to teach about the Catholic faith and the solutions to the problems of discerning and living the faith, a role that he could play well as a former head of the Church&#x27;s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. 

==== &quot;Friendship with Jesus Christ&quot; ====
After his first homily as pope, Benedict referred to both Jesus Christ and John PaulII. Citing John PaulII&#x27;s well-known words, &quot;Do not be afraid! Open wide the doors for Christ!&quot;, Benedict said:

&quot;Friendship with Jesus Christ&quot; was a frequent theme of Benedict&#x27;s preaching. He stressed that on this intimate friendship, &quot;everything depends&quot;. He also said: &quot;We are all called to open ourselves to this friendship with God ... speaking to Him as to a friend, the only One who can make the world both good and happy ... That is all we have to do is put ourselves at His disposal ... is an extremely important message. It is a message that helps to overcome what can be considered the great temptation of our time: the claim, that after the Big Bang, God withdrew from history.&quot; Thus, in his book &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;, his main purpose was &quot;to help foster [in the reader] the growth of a living relationship&quot; with Jesus Christ. He took up this theme in his first encyclical &quot;Deus caritas est&quot;. In his explanation and summary of the encyclical, he stated: &quot;If friendship with God becomes for us something ever more important and decisive, then we will begin to love those whom God loves and who are in need of us. God wants us to be friends of His friends and we can be so, if we are interiorly close to them.&quot; Thus, he said that prayer is &quot;urgently needed ... It is time to reaffirm the importance of prayer in the face of the activism and the growing secularism of many Christians engaged in charitable work.&quot;

==== &quot;Dictatorship of relativism&quot; ====
Continuing what he said in the pre-conclave Mass about what he often referred to as the &quot;central problem of our faith today&quot;, on 6 June 2005, Benedict also said:
Benedict said that &quot;a dictatorship of relativism&quot; was the core challenge facing the Church and humanity. At the root of this problem, he said, is Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;self-limitation of reason&quot;. This, he said, is contradictory to the modern acclamation of science whose excellence is based on the power of reason to know the truth. He said that this self-amputation of reason leads to pathologies of religion such as terrorism and pathologies of science such as ecological disasters. Benedict traced the failed revolutions and violent ideologies of the 20th century to a conversion of partial points of view into absolute guides. He said &quot;Absolutizing what is not absolute but relative is called totalitarianism.&quot;

==== Christianity as religion according to reason ====
In the discussion with secularism and rationalism, one of Benedict&#x27;s basic ideas can be found in his address on the &quot;Crisis of Culture&quot; in the West, a day before Pope John PaulII died, when he referred to Christianity as the &quot;religion of the &quot;Logos&quot;&quot; (the Greek for &quot;word&quot;, &quot;reason&quot;, &quot;meaning&quot;, or &quot;intelligence&quot;). He said:

Benedict also emphasised that &quot;Only creative reason, which in the crucified God is manifested as love, can really show us the way.&quot;

==== Encyclicals ====

Benedict wrote three encyclicals: &quot;Deus caritas est&quot; (Latin for &quot;God is Love&quot;), &quot;Spe salvi&quot; (&quot;Saved by Hope&quot;), and &quot;Caritas in veritate&quot; (&quot;Love in Truth&quot;).

In his first encyclical, &quot;Deus caritas est&quot;, he said that a human being, created in the image of God who is love, can practise love: to give himself to God and others (agape) by receiving and experiencing God&#x27;s love in contemplation. This life of love, according to him, is the life of the saints such as Teresa of Calcutta and the Blessed Virgin Mary, and is the direction Christians take when they believe that God loves them in Jesus Christ. The encyclical contains almost 16,000 words in 42 paragraphs. The first half is said to have been written by Benedict in German, his first language, in the summer of 2005; the second half is derived from uncompleted writings left by his predecessor, Pope John PaulII. The document was signed by Benedict on Christmas Day, 25 December 2005. The encyclical was promulgated a month later in Latin and was translated into English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish. It is the first encyclical to be published since the Vatican decided to assert copyright in the official writings of the pope.

Benedict&#x27;s second encyclical titled &quot;Spe Salvi&quot; (&quot;Saved by Hope&quot;), about the virtue of hope, was released on 30 November 2007.

His third encyclical titled &quot;Caritas in veritate&quot; (&quot;Love in Truth&quot; or &quot;Charity in Truth&quot;), was signed on 29 June 2009 (the Feast of Sts. Peter and Paul) and released on 7 July 2009. In it, the Pope continued the Church&#x27;s teachings on social justice. He condemned the prevalent economic system &quot;where the pernicious effects of sin are evident,&quot; and called on people to rediscover ethics in business and economic relations.

At the time of his resignation, Benedict had completed a draft of a fourth encyclical entitled &quot;Lumen fidei&quot; (&quot;The Light of Faith&quot;), intended to accompany his first two encyclicals to complete a trilogy on the three theological virtues of faith, hope, and love. Benedict&#x27;s successor, Francis, completed and published &quot;Lumen Fidei&quot; in June 2013, four months after Benedict&#x27;s retirement and Francis&#x27;s succession. Although the encyclical is officially the work of Francis, paragraph 7 of the encyclical explicitly expresses Francis&#x27;s debt to Benedict: &quot;These considerations on faith – in continuity with all that the Church&#x27;s magisterium has pronounced on this theological virtue – are meant to supplement what BenedictXVI had written in his encyclical letters on charity and hope. He himself had almost completed a first draft of an encyclical on faith. For this I am deeply grateful to him, and as his brother in Christ I have taken up his fine work and added a few contributions of my own.&quot;

==== Post-synodal apostolic exhortation ====
&quot;Sacramentum caritatis&quot; (The Sacrament of Charity), signed 22 February 2007, was released in Latin, Italian, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, and Polish. It was made available in various languages on 13 March 2007 in Rome. The English edition of &quot;Libera Editrice Vaticana&quot; is 158 pages. This apostolic exhortation &quot;seeks to take up the richness and variety of the reflections and proposals which emerged from the Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops&quot; which was held in 2006.

==== &quot;Motu proprio&quot; on Tridentine Mass ====


On 7 July 2007, Benedict issued the &quot;motu proprio Summorum Pontificum&quot;, declaring that upon &quot;the request of the faithful&quot;, the celebration of Mass according to the Missal of 1962 (of the Tridentine Mass), was to be more easily permitted. Stable groups who previously had to petition their bishop to have a Tridentine Mass may now merely request permission from their local priest. While &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot; directs that pastors should provide the Tridentine Mass upon the requests of the faithful, it also allows for any qualified priest to offer private celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, to which the faithful may be admitted if they wish. For regularly scheduled public celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, the permission of the priest in charge of the church is required.

In an accompanying letter, the Pope outlined his position concerning questions about the new guidelines. As there were fears that the move would entail a reversal of the Second Vatican Council, Benedict emphasised that the Tridentine Mass would not detract from the council and that the Mass of Paul VI would still be the norm and priests were not permitted to refuse to say the Mass in that form. He pointed out that the use of Tridentine Mass &quot;was never juridically abrogated and, consequently, in principle, was always permitted.&quot; The letter also decried &quot;deformations of the liturgy ... because in many places celebrations were not faithful to the prescriptions of the new Missal&quot; as the Second Vatican Council was wrongly seen &quot;as authorising or even requiring creativity&quot;, mentioning his own experience.

The Pope considered that allowing the Tridentine Mass to those who request it was a means to prevent or heal schism, stating that, on occasions in history, &quot;not enough was done by the Church&#x27;s leaders to maintain or regain reconciliation and unity&quot; and that this &quot;imposes an obligation on us today: to make every effort to enable for all those who truly desire unity to remain in that unity or to attain it anew.&quot; Cardinal Darío Castrillón Hoyos, the president of the Pontifical Commission established to facilitate full ecclesial communion of those associated with that Society, stated that the decree &quot;opened the door for their return&quot;. Bishop Bernard Fellay, superior general of the SSPX, expressed &quot;deep gratitude to the Sovereign Pontiff for this great spiritual benefit&quot;.

In July 2021, Pope Francis issued the apostolic letter titled &quot;Traditionis custodes&quot;, which substantially reversed the decision of BenedictXVI in &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot; and imposed new and broad restrictions on the use of the Traditional Latin Mass. The decision was controversial and widely criticized by conservative and traditionalist Catholics as lacking in charity and an attack on those attached to the liturgical patrimony of the Church.

==== Unicity and salvific universality of the Catholic Church ====
Near the end of June 2007, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a document approved by BenedictXVI &quot;because some contemporary theological interpretations of Vatican II&#x27;s ecumenical intent had been &#x27;erroneous or ambiguous&#x27; and had prompted confusion and doubt.&quot; The document has been seen as restating &quot;key sections of a 2000 text the pope wrote when he was prefect of the congregation, &quot;Dominus Iesus&quot;.&quot;

==== Consumerism ====
Benedict condemned excessive consumerism, especially among youth. He stated in December 2007 that &quot;[A]dolescents, youths and even children are easy victims of the corruption of love, deceived by unscrupulous adults who, lying to themselves and to them, draw them into the dead-end streets of consumerism.&quot; In June 2009, he blamed outsourcing for the greater availability of consumer goods which lead to the downsizing of social security systems.

=== Ecumenism ===


Speaking at his weekly audience in St. Peter&#x27;s Square on 7 June 2006, Benedict asserted that Jesus himself had entrusted the leadership of the Church to his apostle Peter. &quot;Peter&#x27;s responsibility thus consists of guaranteeing the communion with Christ. Let us pray so that the primacy of Peter, entrusted to poor human beings, may always be exercised in this original sense desired by the Lord, so that it will be increasingly recognised in its true meaning by brothers who are still not in communion with us.&quot;

Also in 2006, Benedict met the Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. In their Common Declaration, they highlighted the previous 40 years of dialogue between Catholics and Anglicans while also acknowledging &quot;serious obstacles to our ecumenical progress&quot;.

On 4 November 2009, in response to a 2007 petition by the Traditional Anglican Church, Benedict issued the apostolic constitution &quot;Anglicanorum coetibus&quot;, which authorized the creation of &quot;Personal Ordinariates for Anglicans entering into full communion.&quot; Between 2011 and 2012, three ordinariates were erected, currently totalling 9090 members, 194 priests, and 94 parishes.

=== Interfaith dialogue ===

==== Judaism ====
When Benedict ascended to the papacy, his election was welcomed by the Anti-Defamation League who noted &quot;his great sensitivity to Jewish history and the Holocaust&quot;. However, his election received a more reserved response from British Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, who hoped that Benedict would &quot;continue along the path of Pope JohnXXIII and Pope John PaulII in working to enhance relations with the Jewish people and the State of Israel.&quot; Israeli foreign minister Silvan Shalom also offered tentative praise, though Shalom believed that &quot;this Pope, considering his historical experience, will be especially committed to an uncompromising fight against anti-Semitism.&quot;

Critics have accused Benedict&#x27;s papacy of insensitivity towards Judaism. The two most prominent instances were the expansion of the use of the Tridentine Mass and the lifting of the excommunication on four bishops from the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX). In the Good Friday service, the Tridentine Mass rubrics include a prayer that asks God to lift the veil so &quot;they [Jews] may be delivered from their darkness&quot;. This prayer has historically been contentious in Judaic-Catholic relations and several groups saw the restoration of the Tridentine Mass as problematic. Among those whose excommunications were lifted was Bishop Richard Williamson, an outspoken historical revisionist sometimes interpreted as a Holocaust denier. The lifting of his excommunication led critics to charge that the Pope was condoning his historical revisionist views.

==== Islam ====
Benedict&#x27;s relations with Islam were strained at times. On 12 September 2006, he delivered a lecture which touched on Islam at the University of Regensburg in Germany. He had served there as a professor of theology before becoming Pope, and his lecture was entitled &quot;Faith, Reason and the UniversityMemories and Reflections&quot;. The lecture received much attention from political and religious authorities. Many Islamic politicians and religious leaders registered their protest against what they labelled an insulting mischaracterization of Islam, although his focus was aimed towards the rationality of religious violence, and its effect on the religion. Muslims were particularly offended by a passage that the Pope quoted in his speech: &quot;Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.&quot;

The passage originally appeared in the &quot;Dialogue Held with a Certain Persian, the Worthy Mouterizes, in Anakara of Galatia&quot; written in 1391 as an expression of the views of the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaeologus, one of the last Christian rulers before the Fall of Constantinople to the Muslim Ottoman Empire, on such issues as forced conversion, holy war, and the relationship between faith and reason. According to the German text, the Pope&#x27;s original comment was that the emperor &quot;addresses his interlocutor in an astoundingly harshto us surprisingly harshway&quot; &quot;(wendet er sich in erstaunlich schroffer, uns überraschend schroffer Form).&quot; Benedict apologized for any offence he had caused and made a point of visiting Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country, and praying in its Blue Mosque. Benedict planned on 5 March 2008, to meet with Muslim scholars and religious leaders autumn 2008 at a Catholic-Muslim seminar in Rome. That meeting, the &quot;First Meeting of the Catholic-Muslim Forum,&quot; was held from 4–6 November 2008. On 9 May 2009, Benedict visited the King Hussein Mosque in Amman, Jordan where he was addressed by Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad.

==== Buddhism ====
The Dalai Lama congratulated BenedictXVI upon his election, and visited him in October 2006 in Vatican City. In 2007, the People&#x27;s Republic of China was accused of using its political influence to stop a meeting between the Pope and the Dalai Lama.

==== Indigenous American beliefs ====
While visiting Brazil in May 2007, &quot;the pope sparked controversy by saying that native populations had been &#x27;silently longing&#x27; for the Christian faith brought to South America by colonizers.&quot; The Pope continued, stating that &quot;the proclamation of Jesus and of his Gospel did not at any point involve an alienation of the pre-Columbus cultures, nor was it the imposition of a foreign culture.&quot; Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez demanded an apology, and an indigenous organization in Ecuador issued a response which stated that &quot;representatives of the Catholic Church of those times, with honourable exceptions, were accomplices, deceivers and beneficiaries of one of the most horrific genocides of all humanity.&quot; Later, the Pope, speaking Italian, said at a weekly audience that it was &quot;not possible to forget the suffering and the injustices inflicted by colonizers against the indigenous population, whose fundamental human rights were often trampled&quot; but made no apology.

==== Hinduism ====
While visiting the United States on 17 April 2008, Benedict met with International Society for Krishna Consciousness representative Radhika Ramana Dasa, a noted Hindu scholar and disciple of Hanumatpreshaka Swami. On behalf of the Hindu American community, Radhika Ramana Dasa presented a gift of an Om symbol to Benedict.

=== Pastoral visits and security ===


As pontiff, Benedict carried out numerous Apostolic activities, including journeys in Italy and across the world.

Benedict travelled extensively during the first three years of his papacy. In addition to his travels within Italy, he made two visits to his homeland, Germany, one for World Youth Day and another to visit the towns of his childhood. He also visited Poland and Spain, where he was enthusiastically received. His visit to Turkey, an overwhelmingly Muslim nation, was initially overshadowed by the controversy about a lecture he had given at Regensburg. His visit was met by nationalist and Islamic protesters and was placed under unprecedented security measures. Benedict made a joint declaration with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I in an attempt to begin to heal the rift between the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches.

In 2007, Benedict visited Brazil to address the Bishops&#x27; Conference there and canonize Friar Antônio Galvão, an 18th-century Franciscan. In June 2007, Benedict made a personal pilgrimage and pastoral visit to Assisi, the birthplace of St. Francis. In September, Benedict undertook a three-day visit to Austria, during which he joined Vienna&#x27;s chief rabbi, Paul Chaim Eisenberg, in a memorial to the 65,000 Viennese Jews who perished in Nazi death camps. During his stay in Austria, he also celebrated Mass at the Marian shrine Mariazell and visited Heiligenkreuz Abbey.
In April 2008, Benedict made his first visit to the United States since becoming pope. He arrived in Washington, D.C., where he was formally received at the White House and met privately with US president George W. Bush. While in Washington, the pope addressed representatives of US Catholic universities, met with leaders of other world religions, and celebrated Mass at the Washington Nationals&#x27; baseball stadium with 47,000 people. The Pope also met privately with victims of sexual abuse by priests. The Pope travelled to New York City where he addressed the United Nations General Assembly. Also while in New York, the Pope celebrated Mass at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, met with disabled children and their families, and attended an event for Catholic youth, where he addressed some 25,000 young people in attendance. On the final day of the Pope&#x27;s visit, he visited the World Trade Center site and later celebrated Mass at Yankee Stadium.

In July 2008, the Pope travelled to Australia to attend World Youth Day 2008 in Sydney. On 19 July, in St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, he made an apology for child sex abuse perpetrated by the clergy in Australia. On 13 September 2008, at an outdoor Paris Mass attended by 250,000 people, Benedict condemned the modern materialism – the world&#x27;s love of power, possessions, and money as a modern-day plague, comparing it to paganism. In 2009, he visited Africa (Cameroon and Angola) for the first time as pope. During his visit, he suggested that altering sexual behaviour was the answer to Africa&#x27;s AIDS crisis and urged Catholics to reach out and convert believers in sorcery. He visited the Middle East (Jordan, Israel, and Palestine) in May 2009.

Benedict&#x27;s main arena for pastoral activity was the Vatican itself, his Christmas and Easter homilies and Urbi et Orbi were delivered from St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. The Vatican is also the only regular place where Benedict travelled via motor without the protective bulletproof case common to most popemobiles. Despite the more secure setting, Benedict was victim to security risks several times inside Vatican City. On Wednesday, 6 June 2007, during his General Audience, a man leapt across a barrier, evaded guards, and nearly mounted the Pope&#x27;s vehicle, although he was stopped and Benedict seemed to be unaware of the event. On Thursday, 24 December 2009, while Benedict was proceeding to the altar to celebrate Christmas Eve Mass at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, a woman later identified as 25-year-old Susanna Maiolo, who holds Italian and Swiss citizenship, jumped the barrier and grabbed the Pope by his vestments and pulled him to the ground. The 82-year-old Benedict fell but was assisted to his feet and he continued to proceed toward the altar to celebrate Mass. Roger Etchegaray, the vice-dean of the College of Cardinals, fell as well and suffered a hip fracture. Italian police reported that Maiolo had in a prior action attempted to accost Benedict at the previous Christmas Eve Mass, but was prevented from doing so.
In his homily, Benedict forgave Susanna Maiolo and urged the world to &quot;wake up&quot; from selfishness and petty affairs, and find time for God and spiritual matters.

Between 17 and 18 April 2010, Benedict made an Apostolic Journey to the Republic of Malta. Following meetings with various dignitaries on his first day on the island, 50,000 people gathered in a drizzle for Papal Mass on the granaries in Floriana. The Pope also met with the Maltese youth at the Valletta Waterfront, where an estimated 10,000 young people turned up to greet him.

=== Sexual abuse in the Catholic Church ===
Prior to 2001, the primary responsibility for investigating allegations of sexual abuse and disciplining perpetrators rested with the individual dioceses. In 2001, Ratzinger convinced John PaulII to put the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in charge of all sexual abuse investigations. According to John L. Allen Jr., Ratzinger in the following years &quot;acquired a familiarity with the contours of the problem that virtually no other figure in the Catholic Church can claim. Driven by that encounter with what he would later refer to as &#x27;filth&#x27; in the Church, Ratzinger seems to have undergone something of a &#x27;conversion experience&#x27; throughout 2003–04. From that point forward, he and his staff seemed driven by a convert&#x27;s zeal to clean up the mess.&quot;

Cardinal Vincent Nichols wrote that in his role as head of the CDF &quot;[Ratzinger] led important changes made in church law: the inclusion in canon law of internet offences against children, the extension of child abuse offences to include the sexual abuse of all under 18, the case by case waiving of the statute of limitation and the establishment of a fast-track dismissal from the clerical state for offenders.&quot; According to Charles J. Scicluna, a former prosecutor handling sexual abuse cases, &quot;Cardinal Ratzinger displayed great wisdom and firmness in handling those cases, also demonstrating great courage in facing some of the most difficult and thorny cases, &quot;sine acceptione personarum&quot; [without respect of persons]&quot;. According to Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, Ratzinger &quot;made entirely clear efforts not to cover things up but to tackle and investigate them. This was not always met with approval in the Vatican&quot;. Ratzinger had pressed John PaulII to investigate Hans Hermann Groër, an Austrian cardinal and friend of John Paul accused of sexual abuse, which resulted in Groër&#x27;s resignation.

In March 2010, Benedict sent a pastoral letter to the Catholic Church in Ireland addressing cases of sexual abuse by priests of minors, expressing sorrow and promising changes in the way in which accusations of abuse were addressed. Victims&#x27; groups claimed the letter failed to clarify if secular law enforcement had priority over canon law confidentiality regarding internal investigation of abuse allegations. The Pope then promised to introduce measures that would &quot;safeguard young people in the future&quot; and &quot;bring to justice&quot; priests who were responsible for abuse and the next month the Vatican issued guidelines on how existing church law should be implemented. The guidelines asserted that &quot;Civil law concerning reporting of crimes ... should always be followed.&quot;

==== As Archbishop of Munich and Freising ====
Despite being more proactive than his predecessor in addressing sexual abuse, Benedict was nonetheless cited as failing to do so on more than one occasion. In January 2022, a report written by German law firm Westpfahl Spilker Wastl and commissioned by the Catholic Church concluded that Cardinal Ratzinger failed to adequately take action against clerics in four cases of alleged abuse while he was Archbishop of Munich and Freising from 1977 to 1982. The pope emeritus denied the accusations. Benedict corrected his former statement that he had not been at a meeting of the ordinariate of the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising in January 1980, saying he mistakenly told German investigators he was not there. However, the error was &quot;not done out of bad faith&quot;, but &quot;the result of an error in the editorial processing&quot; of his statement. According to Reuters, lawyer Martin Pusch said that &quot;in a total of four cases, we have come to the conclusion that the then Archbishop Cardinal Ratzinger can be accused of misconduct in cases of sexual abuse.&quot;

In February 2022, Benedict admitted that errors were made in the treating of sexual abuse cases when he was Archbishop of Munich. According to the letter released by the Vatican, he asked forgiveness for any &quot;grievous fault&quot; but denied personal wrongdoing. Benedict stated: &quot;I have had great responsibilities in the Catholic Church. All the greater is my pain for the abuses and the errors that occurred in those different places during the time of my mandate.&quot; Public prosecutor&#x27;s office in Munich had begun investigations as a result of the 2022 report against both Benedict and Cardinal Friedrich Wetter. The investigation was &quot;discontinued&quot; in March 2023 after it &quot;did not reveal sufficient suspicion of criminal activity&quot;. The case of the investigation &quot;was not acts of abuse committed by the Church personnel managers themselves, but possible acts of aiding and abetting by active action or omission&quot;.

==== Legion of Christ founder Marcial Maciel ====
One of the cases Ratzinger pursued involved Marcial Maciel, a Mexican priest and founder of the Legionaries of Christ who had been accused repeatedly of sexual abuse. Biographer Andrea Tornielli suggested that Cardinal Ratzinger had wanted to take action against Maciel but that John PaulII and other high-ranking officials, including several cardinals and the Pope&#x27;s influential secretary Stanisław Dziwisz, prevented him from doing so.

According to Jason Berry, Cardinal Angelo Sodano &quot;pressured&quot; Ratzinger, who was &quot;operating on the assumption that the charges were not justified&quot;, to halt the proceedings against Maciel in 1999. When Maciel was honoured by the Pope in 2004, new accusers came forward and Cardinal Ratzinger &quot;took it on himself to authorize an investigation of Maciel&quot;. After Ratzinger became pope, he began proceedings against Maciel and the Legion of Christ that forced Maciel out of active service in the Church. On 1 May 2010, the Vatican issued a statement denouncing &quot;the most serious and objectively immoral behaviour of Father Maciel, confirmed by incontrovertible witnesses, which amount to true crimes and show a life deprived of scruples and authentic religious feeling.&quot;

==== Theodore McCarrick controversy ====
In November 2020, the Vatican published a report blaming Popes John PaulII and BenedictXVI for allowing defrocked former cardinal Theodore McCarrick to rise in power despite the fact that they both knew of sex abuse allegations against him. Despite the fact that Benedict pressured McCarrick to resign as Archbishop of Washington D.C. in 2006, McCarrick remained very active in ministry throughout Benedict&#x27;s papacy and even made a very public appearance when he presided over US senator Ted Kennedy&#x27;s burial service at Arlington National Cemetery in 2009.

==== Post-papacy ====
In 2019, Benedict released a 6,000-word letter that attributed the Church&#x27;s sexual abuse crisis to an erosion of morality driven by secularization and the sexual revolution of the 1960s. The letter was in sharp contrast to the viewpoint of his successor, Francis, who saw the issue as a byproduct of abuses of power within the Church&#x27;s hierarchical structure. &quot;The New York Times&quot; later reported that &quot;given his frail health at the time, however, many church watchers questioned whether Benedict had indeed written the letter or had been manipulated to issue it as a way to undercut Francis.&quot;

Upon Benedict&#x27;s death, his efforts to combat sexual abuse in the Church were remembered with mixed reactions, in particular by victims&#x27; groups. Francesco Zanardi, founder of the Italian victims&#x27; group &quot;Rete l&#x27;Abuso&quot; stated that &quot;Ratzinger was less communicative than Francis but he moved&quot; in the right direction, and that he was the first pontiff to effectively do so. Anne Barrett Doyle, a co-director of BishopAccountability.org, an advocacy and research group, said that Benedict would be &quot;remembered chiefly for his failure to achieve what should have been his job one: to rectify the incalculable harm done to the hundreds of thousands of children sexually abused by Catholic priests.&quot; She stated that his tenure had &quot;left hundreds of culpable bishops in power and a culture of secrecy intact,&quot; while the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests said in a statement that &quot;Benedict was more concerned about the church&#x27;s deteriorating image and financial flow to the hierarchy versus grasping the concept of true apologies followed by true amends to victims of abuse&quot;.

=== Attire ===

Benedict re-introduced several papal garments which had fallen into disuse. He resumed the use of the traditional red papal shoes, which had been used since Roman times by popes but which had fallen into disuse during the pontificate of John PaulII. Contrary to the initial speculation of the press that the shoes had been made by the Italian fashion house Prada, the Vatican announced that the shoes were provided by the Pope&#x27;s personal shoemaker.

The journalist Charlotte Allen described Benedict as &quot;the pope of aesthetics&quot;: &quot;He has reminded a world that looks increasingly ugly and debased that there is such a thing as the beautifulwhether it&#x27;s embodied in a sonata or an altarpiece or an embroidered cope or the cut of a cassockand that earthly beauty ultimately communicates a beauty that is beyond earthly things.&quot;

=== Health ===
Prior to his election as pope in 2005, Ratzinger had hoped to retireon account of age-related health problems, a long-held desire to have free time to write, and the retirement age for bishops (75)and submitted his resignation as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith three times, but continued at his post in obedience to the wishes of John PaulII. In September 1991, Ratzinger suffered a haemorrhagic stroke, which slightly impaired his eyesight temporarily but from which he recovered completely. This was never officially made publicthe official news was that he had fallen and struck his head against a radiatorbut was an open secret known to the conclave that elected him pope.
Following his election in April 2005 there were several rumours about the Pope&#x27;s health, but none of them were confirmed. Early in his pontificate Benedict predicted a short reign, which led to concerns about his health. In May 2005 the Vatican announced that he had suffered another mild stroke. French cardinal Philippe Barbarin said that since the first stroke Ratzinger had been suffering from an age-related heart condition, for which he was on medication. In late November 2006 Vatican insiders told the international press that the Pope had had a routine examination of the heart. A few days later an unconfirmed rumour emerged that Benedict had undergone an operation in preparation for an eventual bypass operation, but this rumour was only published by a small left-wing Italian newspaper and was never confirmed by any Vatican insider.

On 17 July 2009, Benedict was hospitalized after falling and breaking his right wrist while on vacation in the Alps; his injuries were reported to be minor.

Following the announcement of his resignation, the Vatican revealed that Benedict had been fitted with a pacemaker while he was still a cardinal, before his election as pope in 2005. The battery in the pacemaker had been replaced three months earlier, a routine procedure, but that did not influence his decision.

=== Resignation ===
On 11 February 2013, the Vatican confirmed that Benedict would resign the papacy on 28 February 2013, as a result of his advanced age, becoming the first pope to resign since Gregory XII in 1415. At the age of 85 years and 318 days on the effective date of his retirement, he was the fourth-oldest person to hold the office of pope. The move was unexpected, as all popes in modern times had held office until death. Benedict was the first pope to resign without external pressure since Celestine V in 1294.

In his declaration of 10 February 2013, Benedict resigned as &quot;Bishop of Rome, Successor of Saint Peter&quot;. In a statement, he cited his deteriorating strength and the physical and mental demands of the papacy; addressing his cardinals in Latin, he gave a brief statement announcing his resignation. He also declared that he would continue to serve the Church &quot;through a life dedicated to prayer&quot;.

According to a statement from the Vatican, the timing of the resignation was not caused by any specific illness but was to &quot;avoid that exhausting rush of Easter engagements&quot;. After two weeks of ceremonial farewells, the Pope left office at the appointed time and &quot;sede vacante&quot; was declared. Benedict was succeeded by Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who took the papal name of Francis on 13 March 2013.

On the eve of the first anniversary of Benedict&#x27;s resignation he wrote to &quot;La Stampa&quot; to deny speculation he had been forced to step down. &quot;There isn&#x27;t the slightest doubt about the validity of my resignation from the Petrine ministry,&quot; he wrote in a letter to the newspaper. &quot;The only condition for the validity is the full freedom of the decision. Speculation about its invalidity is simply absurd,&quot; he wrote. In an interview on 28 February 2021, Benedict again repeated the legitimacy of his resignation.

== Pope emeritus: 2013–2022 ==
On the morning of 28 February 2013, Benedict met with the full College of Cardinals and in the early afternoon flew by helicopter to the papal summer residence of Castel Gandolfo. He stayed there until refurbishment was completed on his retirement home, the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery in the Vatican Gardens near St. Peter&#x27;s, former home of twelve nuns, where he moved on 2 May 2013.
After his resignation, Benedict retained his papal name rather than reverting to his birth name. He continued to wear the white cassock but without the pellegrina or the fascia. He ceased wearing red papal shoes. Benedict returned his official Fisherman&#x27;s Ring, which was rendered unusable by two large cuts across its face.

According to a Vatican spokesman, Benedict spent his first day as Pope emeritus with Archbishop Georg Gänswein, Prefect of the Papal Household. In the monastery, the pope emeritus did not live a cloistered life, but studied and wrote. He joined Pope Francis several months later at the unveiling of a new statue of Saint Michael the Archangel. The inscription on the statue, according to Cardinal Giovanni Lajolo, has the coat of arms of the two popes to symbolize the fact that the statue was commissioned by Benedict and consecrated by Francis.

In 2013 it was reported that Benedict had multiple health problems including high blood pressure and had fallen out of bed more than once, but the Holy See denied any specific illnesses. The former pope made his first public appearance after his resignation at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica on 22 February 2014 to attend the first papal consistory of his successor Francis. Benedict entered the basilica through a discreet entrance and was seated in a row with several other cardinals. He doffed his zucchetto when Francis came down the nave of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica to greet him. He then made an appearance at the canonization mass of Popes JohnXXIII and John PaulII, greeting the cardinals and Francis.
In August 2014, Benedict celebrated Mass at the Vatican and met with his former doctoral students, an annual tradition he had kept since the 1970s. He attended the beatification of Pope Paul VI in October 2014. Weeks before this, he joined Francis in Saint Peter&#x27;s Square for an audience with grandparents to honour their importance in society.

Benedict wrote the text of a speech, delivered by Archbishop Georg Gänswein, on the occasion of the dedication of the Aula Magna at the Pontifical Urbaniana University to the pope emeritus, &quot;a gesture of gratitude for what he has done for the Church as a conciliar expert, with his teaching as professor, as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and, finally, the Magisterium.&quot; The ceremony took place on Tuesday, 21 October 2014, during the opening of the academic year.

Benedict attended the consistory for new cardinals in February 2015, greeting Francis at the beginning of the celebration. In the summer of 2015, Benedict spent two weeks at Castel Gandolfo, at the invitation of Pope Francis. While at Castel Gandolfo, Benedict participated in two public events. He received two honorary doctorates given to him by Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz, Pope John PaulII&#x27;s longtime aide, from the Pontifical University of John Paul II and the Kraków Academy of Music. In his reception address, Benedict paid homage to his predecessor, John PaulII.

The Joseph Ratzinger–Benedict XVI Roman Library at the Pontifical Teutonic College was announced in April 2015 and was scheduled to open to scholars in November 2015. The library section dedicated to his life and thought is being catalogued. It includes books by or about him and his studies, many donated by Benedict himself.

Benedict, in August 2015, submitted a handwritten card to act as a testimony to the cause of canonization of Pope John Paul I.

In March 2016, Benedict gave an interview expressing his views on mercy and endorsing Francis&#x27;s stress on mercy in his pastoral practice. Also that month, a Vatican spokesman stated that Benedict was &quot;slowly, serenely fading&quot; in his physical health, although his mental capacity remained &quot;perfectly lucid&quot;.

The pope emeritus was honoured by the Roman Curia and Francis in 2016 at a special audience, honouring the 65th anniversary of his ordination to the priesthood. That November, he did not attend the consistory for new cardinals, rather meeting with them and Francis at his residence afterward. Following the death of Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns in December 2016, Benedict became the last living person appointed cardinal by Pope PaulVI.
In June 2017, Benedict received newly created cardinals in his chapel and spoke with each of them in their native language. In July 2017, he sent a message through his private secretary for the funeral of Cardinal Joachim Meisner, who had suddenly died while on vacation in Germany.

In November 2017, images emerged on the Facebook page of the Bishop of Passau, Stefan Oster, of Benedict with a black eye; the bishop and author Peter Seewald visited the former pope on 26 October since the pair were presenting Benedict with the new book &quot;Benedict XVI – The German Pope&quot; which the Passau diocese created. The former pope suffered the hematoma earlier after having slipped.

In late 2019, Benedict collaborated on a book expressing that the Catholic Church must maintain its discipline of clerical celibacy, in light of ongoing debate on the issue, though later requested his name to be removed from the book as co-author.

In June 2020, Benedict visited his dying brother Georg in Germany for the last time. Georg died on 1 July, aged 96.

On 3 August 2020, Benedict&#x27;s aides disclosed that he had an inflammation of the trigeminal nerve. On 2 December of the same year, Maltese cardinal Mario Grech announced to &quot;Vatican News&quot; that Benedict had difficulty speaking and that he had told the new cardinals after the consistory that &quot;the Lord has taken away my speech in order to let me appreciate silence&quot;.

Benedict became the longest-lived pope, whose age can be verified, on 4 September 2020 at 93 years, 141 days, surpassing the age of Pope Leo XIII. There are two popes that are claimed to have lived longer than Benedict: Pope St Agatho (574–681), who died at the age of 107; and Pope Gregory IX (1145–1241), who died at the age of 96. However, although there is some contemporary documentation attesting to their ages, there is not sufficient evidence for them to be verified with complete certainty.

In January 2021, Benedict and Francis each received doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. On 29 June 2021, the pope emeritus celebrated his platinum jubilee (70th anniversary) as a priest.

Following the consistory of 27 August 2022, Francis and the newly created cardinals paid a brief visit to Benedict at Mater Ecclesiae Monastery.

== Death and funeral ==
=== Worsening health and death ===
On 28 December 2022, Pope Francis said at the end of his audience that Benedict was &quot;very sick&quot; and asked God to &quot;comfort him and support him in this testimony of love for the Church until the end&quot;. The same day, Matteo Bruni, the director of the Holy See Press Office, stated that &quot;in the last few hours there has been an aggravation of Benedict&#x27;s health due to advancing age&quot; and that he was under medical care. Bruni also stated that Francis visited Benedict at the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery after the audience.

Benedict died on 31 December 2022 at 9:34am Central European Time at the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery at the age of 95, due to cardiogenic shock, resulting from respiratory failure that evolved from a parenchymal insufficiency. His long-time secretary, Georg Gänswein, reported that his last words were .

=== Funeral ===

From 2 to 4 January 2023, Benedict&#x27;s body lay in state in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, during which around 195,000 people paid their respects. His funeral took place on 5 January 2023 in St. Peter&#x27;s Square at 9:30am, presided over by Pope Francis and celebrated by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re. This was the first time since 1802 that a pope had attended a funeral for his predecessor. The funeral was attended by an estimated 50,000 people. Some attendees held signs reading or shouted &quot;Santo subito&quot;, calling for his elevation to sainthood, a cry heard previously at the funeral of John Paul II. Benedict was interred in the crypt beneath St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, in the same tomb originally occupied by John PaulII and JohnXXIII. The tomb was opened to the public on 8 January 2023.

== Titles and styles ==
As Pope, Benedict&#x27;s rarely used full title was:His Holiness BenedictXVI, Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Sovereign of the Vatican City State, Servant of the servants of God.The best-known title, that of &quot;Pope&quot;, did not appear in the official list of titles, but is commonly used in the titles of documents, and appears, in abbreviated form, in their signatures as &quot;PP.&quot; standing for &quot;Papa&quot; (&quot;Pope&quot;).

Before 1 March 2006, the list of titles also used to contain that of a &quot;Patriarch of the West&quot;, which traditionally appeared in that list of titles before &quot;Primate of Italy&quot;. The title of &quot;Patriarch of the West&quot; was removed in the 2006 edition of &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot;. According to Achille Silvestrini, Benedict chose to remove the title at a time as a &quot;sign of ecumenical sensitivity&quot; on the issue of papal primacy.

After his resignation, the official style of the former pope in English was &quot;His Holiness BenedictXVI, Supreme Pontiff emeritus&quot; or &quot;Pope emeritus&quot;. Less formally he was referred to as emeritus pope or Roman pontifex emeritus. Moreover, according to the 1983 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;, he was also &quot;bishop emeritus of Rome&quot;, retaining the sacred character received at his ordination as a bishop and receiving the title of emeritus of his diocese; although he did not use this style. The pope emeritus had personally preferred to be simply known as &quot;Father&quot;.

== Positions on morality and politics ==
=== Contraception and HIV/AIDS ===
In 2005, the Pope listed several ways to combat the spread of HIV, including chastity, fidelity in marriage, and anti-poverty efforts; he also rejected the use of condoms. The alleged Vatican investigation of whether there are any cases when married persons may use condoms to protect against the spread of infections surprised many Catholics in the wake of John PaulII&#x27;s consistent refusal to consider condom use in response to AIDS. However, the Vatican has since stated that no such change in the Church&#x27;s teaching can occur. &quot;TIME&quot; also reported in its edition of 30 April 2006 that the Vatican&#x27;s position remains what it always has been with Vatican officials &quot;flatly dismiss[ing] reports that the Vatican is about to release a document that will condone any condom use.&quot;

In March 2009, the Pope stated:
I would say that this problem of AIDS cannot be overcome merely with money, necessary though it is. If there is no human dimension, if Africans do not help, the problem cannot be overcome by the distribution of prophylactics: on the contrary, they increase it. The solution must have two elements: firstly, bringing out the human dimension of sexuality, that is to say a spiritual and human renewal that would bring with it a new way of behaving towards others, and secondly, true friendship offered above all to those who are suffering, a willingness to make sacrifices and to practise self-denial, to be alongside the suffering.

In November 2010, in a book-length interview, Benedict, using the example of male prostitutes, stated that the use of condoms, with the intention of reducing the risk of HIV infection, may be an indication that the prostitute is intending to reduce the evil connected with his immoral activity. In the same interview, the Pope also reiterated the traditional teaching of the Church that condoms are not seen as a &quot;real or moral solution&quot; to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Further, in December 2010, the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith explained that Benedict&#x27;s statement did not constitute a legitimization of either contraception or prostitution, which remains gravely immoral.

===Homosexuality===

During his time as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), Cardinal Ratzinger made several efforts to tackle the issue of homosexuality within the Catholic Church and the wider world. In 1986 the CDF sent a letter to all bishops entitled: &quot;On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons&quot;. The letter condemned a liberal interpretation of the earlier CDF document &quot;Declaration on Certain Questions Concerning Sexual Ethics&quot;, which had led to a &quot;benign&quot; attitude &quot;to the homosexual condition itself&quot;. &quot;On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons&quot; clarified that the Church&#x27;s position on homosexuality was that &quot;although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder.&quot; However, the document also condemned homophobic attacks and violence, stating that &quot;It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action. Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church&#x27;s pastors wherever it occurs.&quot;

In 1992, Ratzinger again approved CDF documents declaring that homosexual &quot;inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder&quot; and extended this principle to civil law. &quot;Sexual orientation&quot;, the document said, was not equivalent to race or ethnicity, and it declared that it was &quot;not unjust discrimination to take sexual orientation into account.&quot;

On 22 December 2008, Benedict gave an end-of-year message to the Roman Curia in which he talked about gender and the important distinction between men and women. He said that the Church viewed the distinction as central to human nature, and &quot;asks that this order of creation be respected&quot;. In his words, the Church must &quot;protect man from self-destruction&quot;. He said &quot;something like a human ecology&quot; was needed, and added: &quot;Rain forests deserve indeed to be protected, but no less so does man.&quot; He attacked &quot;gender theories&quot;, which he described as &quot;man&#x27;s attempt at self-emancipation from creation and the Creator.&quot;

LGBT groups, such as the Italian Arcigay and German LSVD, announced that they found Benedict&#x27;s comments homophobic. Aurelio Mancuso, head of Arcigay, said &quot;A divine programme for men and women is out of line with nature, where the roles are not so clear.&quot; Canadian author Daniel Gawthrop, in a critical biography, &quot;The Trial of Pope Benedict&quot;, said that the Pope blamed homosexuality &quot;for a problem the church had willingly enabled for hundreds of years&quot;.

Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi claimed the Pope had not wished specifically to attack people with homosexual inclinations, and had not mentioned gays or lesbians in his text. Lombardi insisted that there had been an overreaction to the pope&#x27;s remarks, saying: &quot;He was speaking more generally about gender theories which overlook the fundamental difference in creation between men and women and focus instead on cultural conditioning.&quot; Nevertheless, the remarks were interpreted as a call to save mankind from homosexuals and transsexuals.

====Same-sex marriage====
In an address to a conference of the Diocese of Rome held at the basilica of St. John Lateran 6 June 2005, Benedict remarked on the issues of same-sex marriage and abortion:

During a 2012 Christmas speech, Benedict made remarks about the present-day interpretation of the notion of gender. He stated that a new philosophy of sexuality, which he rejects, suggests that &quot;sex is no longer a given element of nature, that man has to accept and personally make sense of: it is a social role that we choose for ourselves&quot;, and &quot;The words of the creation account: &#x27;male and female he created them&#x27; (Gen 1:27) no longer apply&quot;. Although he did not mention the topic, his words were interpreted by news media as denunciations of same-sex marriage, with some outlets adding that Benedict would have called it a threat to world peace similar to abortion and euthanasia. In March 2012, he stated that heterosexual marriages should be defended from &quot;every possible misrepresentation of their true nature&quot;.

=== International relations ===
==== Migrants and refugees ====

In a message released 14 November 2006, during a Vatican press conference for the 2007 annual observance of World Day for Migrants and Refugees, the Pope urged the ratification of international conventions and policies that defend all migrants, including refugees, exiles, evacuees and internally displaced persons. &quot;The church encourages the ratification of the international legal instruments that aim to defend the rights of migrants, refugees and their families,&quot; the Pope said. &quot;Much is already being done for the integration of the families of immigrants, although much still remains to be done.&quot;

Benedict also promoted various UN events, such as World Refugee Day, on which he offered up special prayers for refugees and called for the international community to do more to secure refugees&#x27; human rights. He also called on Catholic communities and organizations to offer them concrete help.

In 2015, it was reported that Benedict was &quot;praying for migrants and refugees&quot; from Syria.

==== China ====

In 2007, Benedict sent a letter at Easter to Catholics in China that could have wide-ranging implications for the Church&#x27;s relationship with China&#x27;s leadership. The letter provides long-requested guidance to Chinese bishops on how to respond to illicitly ordained bishops, as well as how to strengthen ties with the Patriotic Association and the Communist government. Benedict wrote that despite the two Catholic communities in China (i.e. the &quot;Patriotic&quot; Church and the &quot;Underground&quot; Church) there is no schism between them. Benedict stated that sacraments performed by the priests not in unity with the Vatican were valid but also illicit. He stated that the Catholic Church accepts the legitimacy of the civil authorities in secular matters and that the Pope has authority in ecclesial matters, and therefore the involvement of the Catholic Patriotic Association in the appointment of bishops (and its bishops conference) violated Catholic doctrine. The letter also removed the permission granted by the Vatican in 1978 to the Underground church to appoint bishops without Vatican approval.

==== Korea ====
On 13 November 2006, Benedict said that the dispute over the North Korea nuclear weapons program should be resolved through negotiations, in his first public comment on the security issue, a news report said. &quot;The Holy See encourages bilateral or multilateral negotiations, convinced that the solution must be sought through peaceful means and in respect for agreements taken by all sides to obtain the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.&quot; Benedict was talking to the new Japanese ambassador to the Vatican.

==== Turkey ====

In a 2004 &quot;Le Figaro&quot; interview, Ratzinger said that Turkey, which is demographically Muslim but governmentally secular by virtue of its state constitution, should seek its future in an association of Muslim nations rather than the European Union, which Ratzinger stated has Christian roots. He said Turkey had always been &quot;in permanent contrast to Europe and that linking it to Europe would be a mistake&quot;.

Later visiting the country to &quot;reiterate the solidarity between the cultures,&quot; it was reported that Benedict made a counter-statement backing Turkey&#x27;s bid to join the EU. Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that the Pope told him in their meeting that while the Vatican seeks to stay out of politics, it desires Turkey&#x27;s membership in the EU. However, the Common Declaration of Pope BenedictXVI and Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople implied that support for Turkey&#x27;s membership in the European Union would be contingent on the establishment of religious freedom in Turkey: &quot;In every step towards unification, minorities must be protected, with their cultural traditions and the distinguishing features of their religion.&quot;

==== Israel ====

In May 2009, Benedict visited Israel. This was the third Papal visit to the Holy Land, the previous ones being made by PaulVI in 1964 and John PaulII in 2000.

==== Vietnam ====

Vietnamese prime minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng met with Benedict at the Vatican on 25 January 2007 in a &quot;new and important step towards establishing diplomatic ties&quot;. The Pope met with Vietnamese president Nguyễn Minh Triết on 11 December 2009. Vatican officials called the meeting &quot;a significant stage in the progress of bilateral relations with Vietnam.&quot;

=== Global economy ===
In July 2009, Benedict published his third encyclical, &quot;Caritas in veritate&quot; (&quot;Charity in truth&quot;), setting out the philosophical and moral foundations for human development, individually and collectively, in striving for the common good. This was the last encyclical of BenedictXVI&#x27;s papacy.

&quot;Caritas in veritate&quot; makes a case for the charitable distribution of wealth in considerable detail and discusses the environment, migration, terrorism, sexual tourism, bioethics, energy and population. &quot;The Financial Times&quot; reported that Benedict&#x27;s advocacy for a fairer redistribution of wealth helped set the agenda for the 2009 July G8 summit.

Also included in &quot;Charity in Truth&quot; is advocacy for tax choice:
One possible approach to development aid would be to apply effectively what is known as fiscal subsidiarity, allowing citizens to decide how to allocate a portion of the taxes they pay to the State. Provided it does not degenerate into the promotion of special interests, this can help to stimulate forms of welfare solidarity from below, with obvious benefits in the area of solidarity for development as well.

=== Nuclear energy ===
Benedict supported the peaceful use of nuclear energy as a tool for development and the fight against poverty. In his message for the 50th anniversary of the founding of the International Atomic Energy Agency, he confirmed: &quot;The Holy See, fully approving of the IAEA&#x27;s goal, has been a member from the organisation&#x27;s foundation and continues to support its activity.&quot;

== Personal life ==
=== Interest in classical music ===
Benedict was known to be deeply interested in classical music, and was an accomplished pianist. His favourite composer was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, of whose music he said: &quot;His music is by no means just entertainment; it contains the whole tragedy of human existence.&quot; Benedict also stated that Mozart&#x27;s music affected him greatly as a young man and &quot;deeply penetrated his soul&quot;. Benedict&#x27;s favourite works of music were Mozart&#x27;s Clarinet Concerto and Clarinet Quintet. He recorded an album of contemporary classical music in which he sings and recites prayers to the Blessed Virgin Mary. The album was set for release on 30 November 2009.

=== Cats ===
Benedict was also known to be fond of cats. As Cardinal Ratzinger, he was known (according to former neighbours) to look after stray cats in his neighbourhood, Borgo. A book called &quot;Joseph and Chico: A Cat Recounts the Life of Pope Benedict XVI&quot; was published in 2007 which told the story of the Pope&#x27;s life from the feline Chico&#x27;s perspective. This story was inspired by an orange tabby Pentling cat, which belonged to the family next door. During his trip to Australia for World Youth Day in 2008, the media reported that festival organizers lent the Pope a grey cat called Bella to keep him company during his stay.

=== Social network use===
In December 2012, the Vatican announced that BenedictXVI had joined social networking website Twitter, under the handle @Pontifex. His first tweet was made on 12 December and was &quot;Dear friends, I am pleased to get in touch with you through Twitter. Thank you for your generous response. I bless all of you from my heart.&quot; On 28 February 2013, the day he retired, the tweets were archived, and @Pontifex read &quot;Sede Vacante&quot;. Pope Francis took control of the @Pontifex account upon his election.

== Honours and awards ==

A variety of awards and honours were given to Benedict including the following:

*1999 Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta
*2010 honorary citizen of Romano Canavese, in Piedmont
*2010 honorary citizen of Lisbon, honouring his visit to the city on 11–12 May 2010 
*The asteroid 8661 Ratzinger was named in his honour for the role he played in supervising the opening of the Vatican Apostolic Archive in 1998 to researchers investigating judicial errors against Galileo and other scientists. The name was proposed by the asteroid&#x27;s discoverers, L. D. Schmadel and F. Borngen at Tautenburg.

== Writings ==
BenedictXVI wrote 66 books, three encyclicals, and four apostolic exhortations.

== Legacy ==

At his death, prior criticism of BenedictXVI received renewed attention, particularly that from public health officials, anti-AIDS activists, and victim&#x27;s rights organizations over his handling of sexual abuse cases within the Catholic Church and position on usage of condoms in areas of high HIV transmission.

Both Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and Patriarch Kirill of Moscow expressed their condolences at Benedict&#x27;s death. Welby referred to the former pope as &quot;one of the greatest theologians of his age&quot;, while Kirill praised conciliatory efforts undertaken between the Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches during Benedict&#x27;s pontificate.

Some Catholics have called for Benedict&#x27;s recognition as a Doctor of the Church, with Cardinal Gerhard Müller describing him as a &quot;true doctor of the Church for today.&quot;

<text>John Bunyan (; 1628 – 31 August 1688) was an English writer and Puritan preacher. He is best remembered as the author of the Christian allegory &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, which also became an influential literary model. In addition to &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, Bunyan wrote nearly sixty titles, many of them expanded sermons.

Bunyan came from the village of Elstow, near Bedford. He had some schooling and, at the age of sixteen, joined the Parliamentary Army at Newport Pagnell during the first stage of the English Civil War. After three years in the army, he returned to Elstow and took up the trade of tinker, which he had learned from his father. He became interested in religion after his marriage, attending first the parish church and then joining the Bedford Meeting, a nonconformist group in St John&#x27;s church Bedford, and later became a preacher. After the restoration of the monarchy, when the freedom of nonconformists was curtailed, Bunyan was arrested and spent the next twelve years in prison because he refused to give up preaching. During this time, he wrote a spiritual autobiography, &quot;Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners&quot;, and began work on his most famous book, &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress.&quot;

In 1676, Charles II withdrew his Declaration of Indulgence and four years later, Bunyan was again imprisoned – this time only for six months. During that time, he completed &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress.&quot;

Bunyan&#x27;s later years were spent in relative comfort and he continued to be a popular author and preacher, and was the pastor of the Bedford Meeting. He died aged 59 after falling ill on a journey to London and is buried in Bunhill Fields. &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; became one of the most published books in the English language; 1,300 editions having been printed by 1938, 250 years after the author&#x27;s death.

Bunyan is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 30 August. Some other churches of the Anglican Communion, such as the Anglican Church of Australia, honour him on the day of his death (31 August).

== Biography ==
===Early life===
John Bunyan was born in 1628 to Thomas and Margaret Bunyan at Bunyan&#x27;s End in the parish of Elstow, Bedfordshire. Bunyan&#x27;s End is about halfway between the hamlet of Harrowden (one mile south-east of Bedford) and Elstow High Street. Bunyan&#x27;s exact date of birth is not known, but he was baptised on 30 November 1628, the baptismal entry in the parish register reading &quot;John the sonne of Thomas Bunnion Jun., the 30 November&quot;. The name Bunyan was spelt in many ways (there are 34 variants in Bedfordshire Record Office) and probably had its origins in the Norman-French name Buignon. There had been Bunyans in Bedfordshire since at least 1199.

Bunyan&#x27;s father was a brazier or tinker who travelled around the area mending pots and pans, and his grandfather Thomas served as a member of the Elstow Manor court and was a chapman (or small trader). Thomas Bunyan had, until his later years, owned land and properties in Elstow, so Bunyan&#x27;s origins were not quite as humble as one might assume from his autobiographical work &quot;Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners&quot; where he wrote that his father&#x27;s house was &quot;of that rank that is meanest and most despised in the country&quot;.

As a child, Bunyan learned his father&#x27;s trade of tinker and was given some schooling but it is not known which school he attended. It may have been at Houghton Conquest or Bedford Grammar. In &quot;Grace Abounding,&quot; Bunyan recorded few details of his upbringing, but he did note how he picked up the habit of swearing (from his father), suffered from nightmares, and read the popular stories of the day in cheap chap-books. In the summer of 1644 Bunyan lost both his mother and his sister Margaret. That autumn, shortly before or after his sixteenth birthday, Bunyan enlisted in the Parliamentary army when an edict demanded 225 recruits from the town of Bedford. There are few details available about his military service, which took place during the first stage of the English Civil War. A muster roll for the garrison of Newport Pagnell shows him as private &quot;John Bunnian&quot;. In &quot;Grace Abounding&quot;, he recounted an incident from this time, as evidence of the grace of God:

When I was a Souldier, I, with others, were drawn out to go to such a place to besiege it; But when I was just ready to go, one of the company desired to go in my room, to which, when I had consented, he took my place; and coming to the siege, as he stood Sentinel, he was shot into the head with a Musket bullet and died.

Bunyan&#x27;s army service provided him with a knowledge of military language which he then used in his book &quot;The Holy War&quot;, and also exposed him to the ideas of the various religious sects and radical groups he came across in Newport Pagnell. The garrison town also gave him opportunities to indulge in the sort of behaviour he would later confess to in &quot;Grace Abounding&quot;: &quot;So that until I came to the state of Marriage, I was the very ringleader of all the Youth that kept me company, in all manner of vice and ungodliness&quot;. Bunyan spent nearly three years in the army, leaving in 1647 to return to Elstow and his trade as a tinker. His father had remarried and had more children and Bunyan moved from Bunyan&#x27;s End to a cottage in Elstow High Street.

===Marriage and conversion===
Within two years of leaving the army, Bunyan married. The name of his wife and the exact date of his marriage are not known, but Bunyan did recall that his wife, a pious young woman, brought with her into the marriage two books that she had inherited from her father: Arthur Dent&#x27;s &quot;Plain Man&#x27;s Pathway to Heaven&quot; and Lewis Bayly&#x27;s &quot;Practice of Piety&quot;. He also recalled that, apart from these two books, the newly-weds possessed little: &quot;not having so much household-stuff as a Dish or a Spoon betwixt us both&quot;. The couple&#x27;s first daughter, Mary, was born in 1650, and it soon became apparent that she was blind. They would have three more children, Elizabeth, Thomas and John.

By his own account, Bunyan had as a youth enjoyed bell-ringing, dancing and playing games including on Sunday, which was forbidden by the Puritans, who held a particularly high view of Sunday, called the Lord&#x27;s Day. One Sunday, the Rev&#x27;d Christopher Hall, vicar of Elstow, preached a sermon against Sabbath breaking and Bunyan took this sermon to heart. That afternoon, as he was playing tip-cat (a game in which a small piece of wood is hit with a stick) on Elstow village green, he heard a voice from the heavens in his soul &quot;Wilt thou leave thy sins, and go to Heaven? Or have thy sins, and go to Hell?&quot; and thought he could feel Jesus Christ looking down from Heaven rebuking him. The next few years were a time of intense spiritual conflict for Bunyan as he struggled with his doubts and fears over religion and guilt over what he saw as his state of sin. He described how he developed a fear of bell-ringing: &quot;I would go to the steeple-house and look on, though I durst not ring . . . but quickly after I began to think how if one of the bells should fall?&quot; He was later unable even to approach the steeple door of the church &quot;for fear the steeple should fall upon my head.&quot;

During this time Bunyan, whilst on his travels as a tinker, happened to be in Bedford when he passed a group of women on a doorstep, talking about spiritual matters. The women were some of the founding members of the Bedford Free Church (or Bedford Meeting) and Bunyan, who had been attending the parish church of Elstow, was so impressed by their talk that he joined their church. At that time the nonconformist group was meeting in St John&#x27;s church in Bedford under the leadership of former Royalist army officer John Gifford. At the instigation of other members of the congregation Bunyan began to preach, both in the church and to groups of people in the surrounding countryside. In 1656, having by this time moved his family to St Cuthbert&#x27;s Street in Bedford, he published his first book, &quot;Gospel Truths Opened&quot;, which was inspired by a dispute with Ranters and Quakers.

In 1658 Bunyan&#x27;s wife died, leaving him with four young children, one of them being blind. A year later he married an eighteen-year-old woman named Elizabeth.

===Imprisonment===
The religious tolerance which had allowed Bunyan the freedom to preach became curtailed with the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. The members of the Bedford Meeting were no longer able to meet in St John&#x27;s church, which they had been sharing with the Anglican congregation. That November, Bunyan was preaching at Lower Samsell, a farm near the village of Harlington, thirteen miles from Bedford, when he was warned that a warrant was out for his arrest. Deciding not to make an escape, he was arrested and brought before the local magistrate Sir Francis Wingate, at Harlington House. Bunyan was arrested under the Religion Act 1592, which made it an offence to attend a religious gathering other than at the parish church with more than five people outside their family. The offence was punishable by 3 months&#x27; imprisonment followed by banishment or execution if the person then failed to promise not to re-offend. The Act had been little used, and Bunyan&#x27;s arrest was probably due in part to concerns that non-conformist religious meetings were being held as a cover for people plotting against the king (although this was not the case with Bunyan&#x27;s meetings). The Act of Uniformity, which made it compulsory for preachers to be ordained by an Anglican bishop and for the revised Book of Common Prayer to be used in church services, was still two years away, and the Act of Conventicles, which made it illegal to hold religious meetings of five or more people outside the Church of England was not passed until 1664.

The trial of Bunyan took place in January 1661 at the quarter sessions in Bedford, before a group of magistrates under John Kelynge, who would later help to draw up the Act of Uniformity. Bunyan, who had been held in prison since his arrest, was indicted of having &quot;devilishly and perniciousy abstained from coming to church to hear divine service&quot; and having held &quot;several unlawful meetings and conventicles, to the great disturbance and distraction of the good subjects of this kingdom&quot;. He was sentenced to three months&#x27; imprisonment with transportation to follow if at the end of this time he did not agree to attend the parish church and desist from preaching.

As Bunyan refused to agree to give up preaching, his period of imprisonment eventually extended to 12 years and brought great hardship to his family. Elizabeth, who made strenuous attempts to obtain his release, had been pregnant when her husband was arrested and she subsequently gave birth prematurely to a still-born child. Left to bring up four step-children, one of whom was blind, she had to rely on the charity of Bunyan&#x27;s fellow members of the Bedford Meeting and other supporters and on what little her husband could earn in gaol by making shoelaces. But Bunyan remained resolute: &quot;O I saw in this condition I was a man who was pulling down his house upon the head of his Wife and Children; yet thought I, I must do it, I must do it&quot;.

Bunyan spent his 12 years&#x27; imprisonment in Bedford County Gaol, which stood on the corner of the High Street and Silver Street. There were, however, occasions when he was allowed out of prison, depending on the gaolers and the mood of the authorities at the time, and he was able to attend the Bedford Meeting and even to preach. His daughter Sarah was born during his imprisonment (the other child of his second marriage, Joseph, was born after his release in 1672).

In prison, Bunyan had a copy of the Bible and of John Foxe&#x27;s &quot;Book of Martyrs&quot;, as well as writing materials. He also had at times the company of other preachers who had been imprisoned. It was in Bedford Gaol that he wrote &quot;Grace Abounding&quot; and started work on &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, as well as penning several tracts that may have brought him a little money. In 1671, while still in prison, he was chosen as pastor of the Bedford Meeting. By that time there was a mood of increasing religious toleration in the country and in March 1672 the king issued a declaration of indulgence which suspended penal laws against nonconformists. Thousands of nonconformists were released from prison, amongst them Bunyan and five of his fellow inmates of Bedford Gaol; Bunyan was freed in May 1672 and immediately obtained a licence to preach under the declaration of indulgence.

===Later life===
Following his release from prison in 1672 Bunyan probably did not return to his former occupation of a tinker. Instead, he devoted his time to writing and preaching. He continued as pastor of the Bedford Meeting and traveled over Bedfordshire and adjoining counties on horseback to preach, becoming known affectionately as &quot;Bishop Bunyan&quot;. His preaching also took him to London, where Lord Mayor Sir John Shorter became a friend and presented him with a silver-mounted walking stick. &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; was published in 1678 by Nathaniel Ponder and immediately became popular, though probably making more money for its publisher than for its author.

Two events marred Bunyan&#x27;s life during the later 1670s. Firstly he became embroiled in a scandal concerning a young woman called Agnes Beaumont. When going to preach in Gamlingay in 1674 he allowed Beaumont, a member of the Bedford Meeting, to ride pillion on his horse, much to the anger of her father, who then died suddenly. His daughter was initially suspected of poisoning him, though the coroner found he had died of natural causes. In 1676–7 he underwent a second term of imprisonment, lasting six months – probably for refusing to attend the parish church.
In 1688, on his way to London to the house of his friend, grocer John Strudwick of Snow Hill, Bunyan made a detour to Reading, Berkshire, to try and resolve a quarrel between a father and son. Travelling on from there to London, he was caught in a storm and fell ill with a fever. He died in Strudwick&#x27;s house on the morning of 31 August 1688 and was buried in a tomb belonging to Strudwick in Bunhill Fields – the nonconformist burial ground in City Road London.

Bunyan&#x27;s estate at his death was worth £42 19s 0d (about £5,200 in 2021). His widow Elizabeth died in 1691.

==Works==

Between 1656, when he published his first work, &quot;Some Gospel Truths Opened&quot; (a tract against the Ranters and Quakers—who at the time were somewhat indistinguishable), and his death in 1688, Bunyan published 42 titles. A further two works, including his Last Sermon, were published the following year by George Larkin. In 1692 Southwark comb-maker Charles Doe, who was a friend of Bunyan&#x27;s in his later years, brought out, with the collaboration of Bunyan&#x27;s widow, a collection of the author&#x27;s works, including 12 previously unpublished titles, mostly sermons. Six years later Doe published &quot;The Heavenly Footman&quot; and finally in 1765 &quot;Relation of My Imprisonment&quot; was published, giving a total of 58 published titles.

Bunyan&#x27;s allegory &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, was completed during his second period of imprisonment but was not published until 1678. It was an immediate success, made Bunyan&#x27;s name as an author and remains the book for which Bunyan is best remembered. The images Bunyan used in &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; are reflections of images from his own world: the strait gate being a version of the wicket gate at Elstow Abbey church; the Slough of Despond is a reflection of Squitch Fen, a wet and mossy area near his cottage in Harrowden; the Delectable Mountains are an image of the Chiltern Hills surrounding Bedfordshire. Even his characters, like the Evangelist as influenced by John Gifford, are reflections of real people.

Further allegorical works were to follow: &quot;The Life and Death of Mr. Badman&quot; (1680), &quot;The Holy War&quot; (1682), and &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress Part II&quot; (1684). &quot;Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners&quot;, a spiritual autobiography, was published in 1666, when he was still in prison.

==Memorials==
There is a small obelisk and an interpretation board marking his birthplace at Bunyan&#x27;s End – in a field beside &#x27;Bumpy Lane&#x27;, which runs northwards from Old Harrowden Road.

In 1862 a recumbent statue was created to adorn Bunyan&#x27;s grave; it was restored in 1922.

In 1874, a bronze statue of John Bunyan, sculpted by Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm, was erected in Bedford. This stands at the south-western corner of St Peter&#x27;s Green, facing Bedford&#x27;s High Street. The site was chosen by Boehm for its significance as a crossroads. Bunyan is depicted expounding the Bible, to an invisible congregation, with a broken fetter representing his imprisonment by his left foot. There are three scenes from &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; on the stone plinth: Christian at the wicket gate; his fight with Apollyon; and losing his burden at the foot of the cross of Jesus. The statue was unveiled by Lady Augusta Stanley, wife of the Dean of Westminster, on Wednesday 10 June 1874. In 1876 the Duke of Bedford gave bronze doors by Frederick Thrupp depicting scenes from &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; to the John Bunyan Meeting (the former Bedford Meeting which had been renamed in Bunyan&#x27;s honour, and now houses the John Bunyan Museum).

There is another statue of him in Kingsway, London, and there are memorial windows in Westminster Abbey, Southwark Cathedral and various churches, including Elstow Abbey (the parish church of Elstow) and the Bunyan Meeting Free Church in Bedford.

Bunyan is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 30 August. Some other churches of the Anglican Communion, such as the Anglican Church of Australia, honour him on the day of his death (31 August).

==Legacy==
Bunyan is best remembered for &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, a book which gained immediate popularity. By 1692, four years after the author&#x27;s death, publisher Charles Doe estimated that 100,000 copies had been printed in England, as well as editions &quot;in France, Holland, New England and Welch&quot;. By 1938, 250 years after Bunyan&#x27;s death, more than 1,300 editions of the book had been printed.

During the 18th century Bunyan&#x27;s unpolished style fell out of favour, but his popularity returned with Romanticism. Many critics deem a turning point in Bunyan scholarship to be when poet Robert Southey wrote a lengthy appreciative biography in 1830 to accompany an edition of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;. Bunyan&#x27;s reputation was further enhanced by the evangelical revival and he became a favourite author of the Victorians. The tercentenary of Bunyan&#x27;s birth, celebrated in 1928, elicited praise from his former adversary, the Church of England. Although popular interest in Bunyan waned during the second half of the twentieth century, academic interest in the writer increased and Oxford University Press brought out a new edition of his works, beginning in 1976. Authors who have been influenced by Bunyan include C. S. Lewis, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Charles Dickens, Louisa May Alcott, George Bernard Shaw, William Thackeray, Charlotte Brontë, Mark Twain, John Steinbeck and Enid Blyton.

Bunyan&#x27;s work, in particular &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, has reached a wider audience through stage, film, TV, and radio productions. An opera based on &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; by Ralph Vaughan Williams, which Williams referred to as a &#x27;Morality&#x27;, was first performed at the Royal Opera House in 1951 as part of the Festival of Britain and revived in 2012 by the English National Opera.

John Bunyan had six children, five of whom are known to have married, of whom four had children. The Moot Hall Museum in Elstow has a record of Bunyan&#x27;s descendants, down to the nineteenth century, but , no verifiable trace of later descendants has been found.

==Selected bibliography==
The best collection of Bunyan&#x27;s writing is &quot;The Works of John Bunyan&quot;, edited by George Offor and published in London in three volumes between 1853 and 1855, containing 61 unique works. (A revised edition was published in 1862.) The misnamed &quot;Complete Works of John Bunyan&quot;, edited by John Gulliver and published in one volume by Bradley, Garretson &amp; Co. in 1871, omits 28 works and lacks the biblical references and editorial footnotes present in Offor&#x27;s collection.

<text>SN 1604, also known as Kepler&#x27;s Supernova, Kepler&#x27;s Nova or Kepler&#x27;s Star, was a Type Ia supernova that occurred in the Milky Way, in the constellation Ophiuchus. Appearing in 1604, it is the most recent supernova in the Milky Way galaxy to have been unquestionably observed by the naked eye, occurring no farther than 6 kiloparsecs (20,000 light-years) from Earth. Before the adoption of the current naming system for supernovae, it was named for Johannes Kepler, the German astronomer who described it in &quot;De Stella Nova&quot;.

==Observation==
Visible to the naked eye, Kepler&#x27;s Star was brighter at its peak than any other star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of −2.5. It was visible during the day for over three weeks. Records of its sighting exist in European, Chinese, Korean, and Arabic sources.
It was the second supernova to be observed in a generation (after SN 1572 seen by Tycho Brahe in Cassiopeia). No further supernovae have since been observed with certainty in the Milky Way, though many others outside the galaxy have been seen since S Andromedae in 1885. SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud was visible to the naked eye at night.

Evidence exists for two Milky Way supernovae whose electromagnetic radiation would have reached Earth 1680 and 1870 – Cassiopeia A, and G1.9+0.3 respectively. There is no historical record of either having been detected in those years, likely because absorption by interstellar dust obscured their visible light.

The remnant of Kepler&#x27;s supernova is considered to be one of the prototypical objects of its kind and is still an object of much study in astronomy.

==Controversies==
Astronomers of the time (including Kepler) were concerned with observing the conjunction of Mars and Jupiter, which they saw as an auspicious conjunction linked to the Star of Bethlehem. However, cloudy weather prevented Kepler from making observations. Wilhelm Fabry, Michael Maestlin, and Helisaeus Roeslin were able to make observations on 9 October, but did not record the supernova. The first recorded observation in Europe was by Lodovico delle Colombe in northern Italy on 9 October 1604. Kepler was only able to begin his observations on 17 October while working at the imperial court in Prague for Emperor Rudolf II. The supernova was subsequently named after him, even though he was not its first observer, as his observations tracked the object for an entire year. These observations were described in his book &quot;De Stella nova in pede Serpentarii&quot; (&quot;On the new star in Ophiuchus&#x27;s foot&quot;, Prague 1606).

===Delle Colombe–Galileo controversy===
In 1606, Delle Colombe published &quot;Discourse of Lodovico delle Colombe&quot; in which he shows that the &quot;Star Newly Appeared in October 1604 is neither a Comet nor a New Star&quot; and where he defended an Aristotelian view of cosmology after Galileo Galilei had used the occasion of the supernova to challenge the Aristotelian system. The description of Galileo&#x27;s claims is as follows:

Galileo explained the meaning and relevance of parallax, reported that the nova displayed none, and concluded, as a certainty, that it lay beyond the moon. Here he might have stopped, having dispatched his single arrow. Instead he sketched a theory that ruined the Aristotelian cosmos: the nova very probably consisted of a large quantity of airy material that issued from the earth and shone by reflected sunlight, like Aristotelian comets. Unlike them, however, it could rise beyond the moon. It not only brought change to the heavens, but did so provocatively by importing corruptible earthy elements into the pure quintessence. That raised heaven-shattering possibilities. The interstellar space might be filled with something similar to our atmosphere, as in the physics of the Stoics, to which Tycho had referred in his lengthy account of the nova of 1572. And if the material of the firmament resembled that of bodies here below, a theory of motion built on experience with objects within our reach might apply also to the celestial regions. &quot;But I am not so bold as to think that things cannot take place differently from the way I have specified.&quot;

===Kepler–Roeslin controversy===
In Kepler&#x27;s &quot;De Stella Nova&quot; (1606), he criticized Roeslin concerning this supernova. Kepler argued that in his astrological prognostications, Roeslin had picked out just the two comets, the Great Comet of 1556 and 1580. Roeslin responded in 1609 that this was indeed what he had done. When Kepler replied later that year, he simply observed that by including a broader range of data Roeslin could have made a better argument.

== Supernova remnant ==

The supernova remnant of SN 1604, Kepler&#x27;s Star, was discovered in 1941 at the Mount Wilson Observatory as a dim nebula with a brightness of 19 mag. Only filaments can be seen in visible light, but it is a strong radio and X-ray source. Its diameter is 4 arc min. Distance estimates place it between 3 and more than 7 kiloparsecs (10,000 to 23,000 lightyears), with the current consensus being a distance of , as of 2021.

The available evidence supports a type Ia supernova as the source of this remnant, which is the result of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf interacting with a companion star. The integrated X-ray spectrum resembles that of Tycho&#x27;s supernova remnant, a type Ia supernova. The abundance of oxygen relative to iron in the remnant of SN 1604 is roughly solar, whereas a core-collapse scenario should produce a much higher abundance of oxygen. No surviving central source has been identified, which is consistent with a type Ia event. Finally, the historical records for the brightness of this event are consistent with type Ia supernovae.

There is evidence for interaction of the supernova ejecta with circumstellar matter from the progenitor star, which is unexpected for type Ia but has been observed in some cases. A bow shock located to the north of this system is believed to have been created by mass loss prior to the explosion. Observations of the remnant are consistent with the interaction of a supernova with a bipolar planetary nebula that belonged to one or both of the progenitor stars. The remnant is not spherically symmetric, which is likely due to the progenitor being a runaway star system. The bow shock is caused by the interaction of the advancing stellar wind with the interstellar medium. A remnant rich in nitrogen and silicon indicates that the system consisted of a white dwarf with an evolved companion that had likely already passed through the asymptotic giant branch stage.

<text>Jon Howard Appleton (January 4, 1939 – January 30, 2022) was an American composer, an educator and a pioneer in electro-acoustic music. His earliest compositions in the medium, e.g. &quot;Chef d&#x27;Oeuvre&quot; and &quot;Newark Airport Rock&quot; (1967) attracted attention because they established a new tradition some have called programmatic electronic music. In 1970, he won Guggenheim, Fulbright and American-Scandinavian Foundation fellowships. When he was twenty-eight years old, he joined the faculty of Dartmouth College where he established one of the first electronic music studios in the United States. He remained there intermittently for forty-two years. In the mid-1970s, he left Dartmouth to briefly become the head of Elektronmusikstudion (EMS) (sv) in Stockholm, Sweden. In the late 1970s, together with Sydney Alonso and Cameron Jones, he helped develop the first commercial digital synthesizer called the Synclavier. For a decade he toured around the United States and Europe performing the compositions he composed for this instrument. In the early 1990s, he helped found the Theremin Center for Electronic Music at the Moscow Conservatory of Music. He also taught at Keio University (Mita) in Tokyo, Japan, CCRMA at Stanford University and the University of California Santa Cruz. In his later years, he devoted most of his time to the composition of instrumental and choral music in a quasi-Romantic vein which has largely been performed only in France, Russia and Japan.

==Early life==
Appleton was born in Los Angeles, California, on January 4, 1939, to Jewish parents: Helen Jacobs Appleton (born in Philadelphia, 1908) and Charles Leonard Appleton (born Chaim Epelboim in Kishinev, Bessarabia, July 14, 1900). His mother was employed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and his father by Twentieth Century Fox film studios. His father left his family the year Appleton was born and he spent his first years in Mrs. Bell&#x27;s (an orphanage) and with his brother (Michael Charles Appleton, born 1932) at Palomar Military Academy. When he was six years old his mother married Alexander &quot;Sasha&quot; Walden (born in Ufa, Russia, in 1897), a double-bass player in the Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestra. He was the greatest musical influence in Appleton&#x27;s young life seeing that he studied piano, encouraging him to compose music and taking him to multiple concerts. Appleton&#x27;s parents were true believers in the Soviet Union and active members of the multiple left-wing organizations including the Communist party. In the 1950s both his parents were blacklisted by the House Un-American Activities Committee and lost their jobs. As a child Appleton studied piano with Jacob Gimpel and Theodore Saidenberg but preferred composing his own music rather than playing the works assigned to him (e.g. Chopin, Scarlatti, Prokofiev). However, he developed a deep, lifelong affection for Russian music.

==Career==
===1960s===
From 1957 to 1961 Appleton was a student at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. These years shaped his future life: he composed for his fellow students who performed everything he composed, he decided to become a college professor and in 1959 he married his first wife, a fellow student, Georganna Towne. Following his graduation from Reed College, Appleton moved to San Francisco, California, where his first child was born (Jennifer Appleton). Simultaneously he studied composition with Andrew Imbrie at the University of California, Berkeley, collaborated with writer Willard S. Bain (1938–2000) writing musical comedies and was employed at the Macy&#x27;s department store as an assistant buyer.

In 1962–1963 Appleton was the music teacher at the Verde Valley School in Sedona, Arizona, where he conducted the choir and orchestra, taught music theory, history and piano lessons.

From 1963 to 1966 Appleton was a graduate student at the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon, where he studied with Homer Keller, Henri Lazarof, Felix Salzer and Robert Trotter. It was there that he assembled a primitive electronic music studio and composed his first works in this genre. His thesis was an orchestral work, &quot;After &quot;Nude Descending a Staircase&quot;&quot;. Most of the instrumental and vocal music he composed at this time used serial technique that he loved to compose. During his years in Eugene he became a lifelong friend of the pianist Gabriel Chodos.

In 1966, on the basis of his early electronic music, he was invited by Vladimir Ussachevsky at Columbia University to study in the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. He became an advocate for electronic music and became friends with fellow composers Charles Dodge, Emmanuel Ghent and Richard Taruskin.

During 1966–1968 he was hired by Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan, to establish an electronic music studio. When the university officials reneged on their promise, he resigned and accepted a position at Dartmouth College. It was during this year that his son, Jon Jason Appleton was born ( JJ Appleton; born April 19, 1967).

===1970s===
At Dartmouth College Appleton&#x27;s work in electronic music was generously encouraged by the administration of President John G. Kemeny and by a generous donation from Gerald Bregman &#x27;54. The Bregman Electronic Music studio was one of the pioneering studios at American universities and became a center for many visiting composers. Two of these, Lars-Gunnar Bodin (1935, Stockholm, Sweden – 2021) and Jean-Claude Risset (born 1938, LePuy, France) became important colleagues throughout Appleton&#x27;s life. In 1970 Appleton also was influenced by the work of the &quot;father&quot; of computer music, Max V. Mathews and by French composers François Bayle, Beatriz Ferreyra and Michel Redolfi.

It was at this time that he initiated the first competition for electronic music that was held for three years at Dartmouth College.

In 1969 Appleton&#x27;s first recordings were published (Syntonic Menagerie and Human Music – the latter in collaboration with jazz musician Don Cherry – on the Flying Dutchman label, produced by Bob Thiele.

In 1973 Appleton began his collaboration with engineers Sydney Alonso and Cameron Jones, which led to the creation of the Dartmouth Digital Synthesizer and ultimately the Synclavier. However, it was not until the 1980s that Appleton composed his best works for this digital synthesizer and on which he gave concerts of his own music for the following decade.

His love of Sweden led Appleton to leave Dartmouth College in 1976–1977 and become the director of Elektronmusikstudion, Sweden&#x27;s national center for electronic music. His difficulty with the Swedish bureaucracy led to his resignation and he returned to Norwich, Vermont, as a partner, for one year, in the newly formed firm New England Digital Corporation that had begun to manufacture the Synclavier. The following year he returned to the faculty of Dartmouth College.

It was also during this time in his life that Appleton developed a serious interest in the music of Polynesia and Micronesia. He led a group of Dartmouth students to the Kingdom of Tonga and later received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to train radio personnel on the Micronesian islands of Chuuk and Pohnpei to record and broadcast their own music.

===1980s===
It was during this period that Appleton began to compose his best computer music and live-electronic music. Many of his works for this genre were first premiered at the annual festival held by the Groupe de Musique Experimentale de Bourges (France) and at Fylkingen in Stockholm, Sweden.

During his time in Bourges, Appleton became a founding member of the International Confederation for Electro-Acoustic Music (). His stimulating interaction with composers from many nations led him to believe that a similar organization in the United States might help raise the profile of electro-acoustic music in his own country. In 1984, together with a small group of like-minded composers, Appleton helped establish the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States (SEAMUS). He ultimately served for a time as president of the society.

In the summer of 1984 Appleton helped Moses Asch, founder of Folkways Records, release its first recordings of electro-acoustic music. According to Asch&#x27;s wishes, these recordings have remained in print under the Smithsonian/Folkways auspices.

===1990s===
The decade of the 1990s saw Appleton spending increasing amount of time abroad: teaching at Keio University (Mita) in Tokyo, Japan, for three years and frequently visiting Moscow, Russia, where he was inspired by the enthusiasm of young composers. He encouraged the composer/engineer Andre Smirnov to establish the Theremin Center at the Moscow Conservatory of Music. Appleton was first introduced to Russian musicians and artists by the choral conductor/ethnologist Dmitri Pokrovsky (1944–1996) and this began his compositional return to instrumental and choral music, much of it composed for the pianist Julia Turkina and cellist Alexander Zagorinsky. In an essay entitled &quot;How I Became a Russian Composer&quot; (2009) Appleton explains his love of Russian music and culture that he believes his stepfather, Alexander Walden, instilled in him.

Also in this decade Appleton composed two full-length operas for a choir of 1500 children and professional orchestra. The works, &quot;HOPI: La naissance de Desert&quot; and &quot;Le Dernier Voyage de Jean-Gallup de la Perouse&quot;, were conducted by Alain Joutard and commissioned by the Delegation Departmental à la Musique et à la Danse of the Conseil General des Alpes-Maritimes in Nice, France.

==Personal life and death==
Appleton died on January 30, 2022, at his home in Vermont, at the age of 83.

<doc id="39666" wikidata="Q207436" url="?curid=39666" title="Supernova remnant">
<text>A supernova remnant (SNR) is the structure resulting from the explosion of a star in a supernova. The supernova remnant is bounded by an expanding shock wave, and consists of ejected material expanding from the explosion, and the interstellar material it sweeps up and shocks along the way.

There are two common routes to a supernova: either a massive star may run out of fuel, ceasing to generate fusion energy in its core, and collapsing inward under the force of its own gravity to form a neutron star or a black hole; or a white dwarf star may accrete material from a companion star until it reaches a critical mass and undergoes a thermonuclear explosion.

In either case, the resulting supernova explosion expels much or all of the stellar material with velocities as much as 10% the speed of light (or approximately 30,000 km/s) and a strong shock wave forms ahead of the ejecta. That heats the upstream plasma up to temperatures well above millions of K. The shock continuously slows down over time as it sweeps up the ambient medium, but it can expand over hundreds or thousands of years and over tens of parsecs before its speed falls below the local sound speed.

One of the best observed young supernova remnants was formed by SN 1987A, a supernova in the Large Magellanic Cloud that was observed in February 1987. Other well-known supernova remnants include the Crab Nebula; Tycho, the remnant of SN 1572, named after Tycho Brahe who recorded the brightness of its original explosion; and Kepler, the remnant of SN 1604, named after Johannes Kepler. The youngest known remnant in the Milky Way is G1.9+0.3, discovered in the Galactic Center.

==Stages==
An SNR passes through the following stages as it expands:

# Free expansion of the ejecta, until they sweep up their own weight in circumstellar or interstellar medium. This can last tens to a few hundred years depending on the density of the surrounding gas.
# Sweeping up of a shell of shocked circumstellar and interstellar gas. This begins the Sedov-Taylor phase, which can be well modeled by a self-similar analytic solution (see blast wave). Strong X-ray emission traces the strong shock waves and hot shocked gas.
# Cooling of the shell, to form a thin (&lt; 1 pc), dense (1 to 100 million atoms per cubic metre) shell surrounding the hot (few million kelvin) interior. This is the pressure-driven snowplow phase. The shell can be clearly seen in optical emission from recombining ionized hydrogen and ionized oxygen atoms.
# Cooling of the interior. The dense shell continues to expand from its own momentum. This stage is best seen in the radio emission from neutral hydrogen atoms.
# Merging with the surrounding interstellar medium. When the supernova remnant slows to the speed of the random velocities in the surrounding medium, after roughly 30,000 years, it will merge into the general turbulent flow, contributing its remaining kinetic energy to the turbulence.
==Types of supernova remnant==
There are three types of supernova remnant:
* Shell-like, such as Cassiopeia A
* Composite, in which a shell contains a central pulsar wind nebula, such as G11.2-0.3 or G21.5-0.9.
* Mixed-morphology (also called &quot;thermal composite&quot;) remnants, in which central thermal X-ray emission is seen, enclosed by a radio shell. The thermal X-rays are primarily from swept-up interstellar material, rather than supernova ejecta. Examples of this class include the SNRs W28 and W44. (Confusingly, W44 additionally contains a pulsar and pulsar wind nebula; so it is simultaneously both a &quot;classic&quot; composite and a thermal composite.)

Remnants which could only be created by significantly higher ejection energies than a standard supernova are called &quot;hypernova remnants&quot;, after the high-energy hypernova explosion that is assumed to have created them.

==Origin of cosmic rays==
Supernova remnants are considered the major source of galactic cosmic rays. 
The connection between cosmic rays and supernovas was first suggested by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in 1934. 
Vitaly Ginzburg and Sergei Syrovatskii in 1964 remarked that if the efficiency of cosmic ray acceleration 
in supernova remnants is about 10 percent, the cosmic ray losses of the Milky Way are compensated.
This hypothesis is supported by a specific mechanism called &quot;shock wave acceleration&quot; based on Enrico Fermi&#x27;s ideas, which is still under development.

In 1949, Fermi proposed a model for the acceleration of cosmic rays through particle collisions with magnetic clouds in the interstellar medium. This process, known as the &quot;Second Order Fermi Mechanism&quot;, increases particle energy during head-on collisions, resulting in a steady gain in energy. A later model to produce Fermi Acceleration was generated by a powerful shock front moving through space. Particles that repeatedly cross the front of the shock can gain significant increases in energy. This became known as the &quot;First Order Fermi Mechanism&quot;.

Supernova remnants can provide the energetic shock fronts required to generate ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Observation of the SN 1006 remnant in the X-ray has shown synchrotron emission consistent with it being a source of cosmic rays. However, for energies higher than about 1018 eV a different mechanism is required as supernova remnants cannot provide sufficient energy.

It is still unclear whether supernova remnants accelerate cosmic rays up to PeV energies. The future telescope CTA will help to answer this question.

<doc id="39668" wikidata="Q1557633" url="?curid=39668" title="Synclavier">
<text>The Synclavier is an early digital synthesizer, polyphonic digital sampling system, and music workstation manufactured by New England Digital Corporation of Norwich, Vermont. It was produced in various forms from the late 1970s into the early 1990s. Used by many notable musicians, the Synclavier was inducted into the TECnology Hall of Fame, an honor given to &quot;products and innovations that have had an enduring impact on the development of audio technology,&quot; in 2004.

== History ==

The original design and development of the Synclavier prototype occurred at Dartmouth College with the collaboration of Jon Appleton, Professor of Digital Electronics, Sydney A. Alonso, and Cameron Jones, a software programmer and student at Dartmouth&#x27;s Thayer School of Engineering.

=== Synclavier I ===
First released in 1977–78, it proved to be highly influential among both electronic music composers and music producers, including Mike Thorne, an early adopter from the commercial world, due to its versatility, its cutting-edge technology, and distinctive sounds.

The early Synclavier I used FM synthesis, re-licensed from Yamaha, and was sold mostly to universities. The initial models had only a computer and synthesis modules; later models added a musical keyboard and control panel.

=== Synclavier II ===

The system evolved in its next generation of product, the Synclavier II, which was released in early 1980 with the strong influence of music producer Denny Jaeger of Oakland, California. It was originally Jaeger&#x27;s suggestion that the FM synthesis concept be extended to allow four simultaneous channels or voices of synthesis to be triggered with one key depression to allow the final synthesized sound to have much more harmonic series activity. This change greatly improved the overall sound design of the system and was very noticeable. 16-bit user sampling (originally in mono only) was added as an option in 1982. This model was succeeded by the ABLE Model C computer-based PSMT in 1984 and then the Mac-based 3200, 6400 and 9600 models, all of which used the VPK keyboard.

=== Keyboard controller ===

Synclavier II models used an on/off type keyboard (called the ORK) while later models, labeled simply &quot;Synclavier&quot;, used a weighted velocity- and pressure-sensitive keyboard (called the VPK) that was licensed from Sequential Circuits and used in their Prophet-T8 synthesizer.

=== Digital sampling ===
The company evolved the system continuously through the early 1980s to integrate the first 16-bit digital sampling system to magnetic disk, and eventually a 16-bit polyphonic sampling system to memory, as well. The company&#x27;s product was the only digital sampling system that allowed sample rates to go as high as 100 kHz.

=== Tapeless studio concept ===

Ultimately, the system was referred to as the &quot;Synclavier Digital Recording Tapeless Studio&quot; system among many professionals. It was a pioneering system in revolutionizing movie and television sound effects and Foley effects methods of design and production starting at Glen Glenn Sound. Although pricing made it inaccessible for most musicians (a Synclavier could cost anywhere from $25,000 to $200,000), it found widespread use among producers and professional recording studios, competing at times in this market with high-end production systems such as the Fairlight CMI.

=== Technological achievements ===
When the company launched and evolved its technology, there were no off-the-shelf computing systems, integrated software, or sound cards. Consequently, all of the hardware from the company&#x27;s main real-time CPU, all input and output cards, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog cards and its memory cards were developed internally, as well as all of the software. The hardware and software of the company&#x27;s real-time capability were used in other fields completely remote to music, such as the main Dartmouth College campus computing node computers for one of the USA&#x27;s first campus-wide computing networks, and in medical data acquisition research projects.

=== End of manufacture ===
New England Digital ceased operations in 1993. According to Jones, &quot;The intellectual property was bought up by a bank—then it was owned by a Canadian company called Airworks—and I bought the intellectual property and the trademark back from a second bank which had foreclosed on it from Airworks.&quot;

=== Reincarnations ===
In 2019, Jones released an iOS version of the Synclavier dubbed Synclavier Go! using much of the original code base. Jones has also worked with Arturia to bring the Synclavier V software version of the instrument to their V Collection plugin suite.

In 2022, Synclavier Digital released and started production on the Regen, a desktop FM synthesizer. 

== Models and options ==

=== Prototype ===
* Dartmouth Digital Synthesizer (1973)

=== Processor ===
* ABLE computer (1975): an early product of New England Digital, was a 16-bit minicomputer on two cards, using a transport-triggered architecture. It used a variant of XPL called Scientific XPL for programming. Early applications of the ABLE were for laboratory automation, data collection, and device control. The commercial version of the Dartmouth Digital Synthesizer, the Synclavier, was built on this processor.

=== Digital synthesis cards ===
* The FM/Additive synthesis waveforms are produced by the Synclavier Synthesizer cards (named SS1 through SS5). Each set of these five cards produced 8 mono FM voices (later variants supported stereo). The processor handles sending start-stop-setPitch-setParameter commands to the SS card set(s), as well as handling scanning of the keyboard and control panel. There is little public documentation available on these cards, as their design was the unique asset of the Synclavier. However, their structure was similar to other digital synthesizers of the mid-late 1970s realized in Medium Scale Integration (MSI) hardware, such as the Bell Labs Digital Synthesizer.

=== Black panel models ===

On 1970s–late 1980s:

* Synclavier I (1977)

<doc id="39669" wikidata="Q30953" url="?curid=39669" title="Dengue fever">
<text>Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease caused by dengue virus, prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas. It is frequently asymptomatic; if symptoms appear, they typically begin 3 to 14 days after infection. These may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin itching and skin rash. Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In a small proportion of cases, the disease develops into severe dengue (previously known as dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome) with bleeding, low levels of blood platelets, blood plasma leakage, and dangerously low blood pressure.

Dengue virus has four confirmed serotypes; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type increases the risk of severe complications. The symptoms of dengue resemble many other diseases including malaria, influenza, and Zika. Blood tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting viral RNA, or antibodies to the virus.

Treatment of dengue fever is symptomatic, as there is no specific treatment for dengue fever. In mild cases, treatment focuses on treating pain. Severe cases of dengue require hospitalisation; treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously.

Dengue is spread by several species of female mosquitoes of the &quot;Aedes&quot; genus, principally &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot;. Infection can be prevented by mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites. Two types of dengue vaccine have been approved and are commercially available. Dengvaxia became available in 2016, but it is only recommended to prevent re-infection in individuals who have been previously infected. The second vaccine, Qdenga, became available in 2022 and is suitable for adults, adolescents and children from four years of age.

The earliest descriptions of a dengue outbreak date from 1779; its viral cause and spread were understood by the early 20th century. Already endemic in more than one hundred countries, dengue is spreading from tropical and subtropical regions to the Iberian Peninsula and the southern states of the US, partly attributed to climate change. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease. During 2023, more than 5 million infections were reported, with more than 5,000 dengue-related deaths. As most cases are asymptomatic or mild, the actual numbers of dengue cases and deaths are under-reported.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Typically, people infected with dengue virus are asymptomatic (80%) or have only mild symptoms such as an uncomplicated fever. Others have more severe illness (5%), and in a small proportion it is life-threatening. The incubation period (time between exposure and onset of symptoms) ranges from 3 to 14 days, but most often it is 4 to 7 days.

The characteristic symptoms of mild dengue are sudden-onset fever, headache (typically located behind the eyes), muscle and joint pains, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands and a rash. If this progresses to severe dengue the symptoms are severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, rapid breathing, bleeding gums or nose, fatigue, restlessness, blood in vomit or stool, extreme thirst, pale and cold skin, and feelings of weakness.

=== Clinical course ===
The course of infection is divided into three phases: febrile, critical, and recovery.

The febrile phase involves high fever (40 °C/104 °F), and is associated with generalized pain and a headache; this usually lasts two to seven days. There may also be nausea, vomiting, a rash, and pains in the muscle and joints.

Most people recover within a week or so. In about 5% of cases, symptoms worsen and can become life-threatening. This is called severe dengue (formerly called &quot;dengue hemorrhagic fever&quot; or &quot;dengue shock syndrome&quot;). Severe dengue can lead to shock, internal bleeding, organ failure and even death. Warning signs include severe stomach pain, vomiting, difficulty breathing, and blood in the nose, gums, vomit or stools.

During this period, there is leakage of plasma from the blood vessels, together with a reduction in platelets. This may result in fluid accumulation in the chest and abdominal cavity as well as depletion of fluid from the circulation and decreased blood supply to vital organs.

The recovery phase usually lasts two to three days. The improvement is often striking, and can be accompanied with severe itching and a slow heart rate.

==== Complications and sequelae ====
Complications following severe dengue include fatigue, somnolence, headache, concentration impairment and memory impairment. A pregnant woman who develops dengue is at higher risk of miscarriage, low birth weight, and premature birth.

Children and older individuals are at a risk of developing complications from dengue fever compared to other age groups; young children typically suffer from more intense symptoms. Concurrent infections with tropical diseases like Zika virus can worsen symptoms and make recovery more challenging.

== Cause ==

=== Virology ===

Dengue virus (DENV) is an RNA virus of the family &quot;Flaviviridae&quot;; genus &quot;Flavivirus&quot;. Other members of the same genus include yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, and Zika virus.
Dengue virus genome (genetic material) contains about 11,000 nucleotide bases, which code for the three structural protein molecules (C, prM and E) that form the virus particle and seven other protein molecules that are required for replication of the virus. There are four confirmed strains of the virus, called serotypes, referred to as DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4. The distinctions between the serotypes are based on their antigenicity.

=== Transmission ===

Dengue virus is most frequently transmitted by the bite of mosquitos in the &quot;Aedes&quot; genus, particularly &quot;A. aegypti&quot;. They prefer to feed at dusk and dawn, but they may bite and thus spread infection at any time of day. Other &quot;Aedes&quot; species that may transmit the disease include &quot;A. albopictus&quot;, &quot;A. polynesiensis&quot; and &quot;A. scutellaris&quot;. Humans are the primary host of the virus, but it also circulates in nonhuman primates, and can infect other mammals. An infection can be acquired via a single bite.

For 2 to 10 days after becoming newly infected, a person&#x27;s bloodstream will contain a high level of virus particles (the viremic period). A female mosquito that takes a blood meal from the infected host then propagates the virus in the cells lining its gut. Over the next few days, the virus spreads to other tissues including the mosquito&#x27;s salivary glands and is released into its saliva. Next time the mosquito feeds, the infectious saliva will be injected into the bloodstream of its victim, thus spreading the disease. The virus seems to have no detrimental effect on the mosquito, which remains infected for life.

Dengue can also be transmitted via infected blood products and through organ donation. Vertical transmission (from mother to child) during pregnancy or at birth has been reported.

=== Risk factors ===

The principal risk for infection with dengue is the bite of an infected mosquito. This is more probable in areas where the disease is endemic, especially where there is high population density, poor sanitation, and standing water where mosquitoes can breed. It can be mitigated by taking steps to avoid bites such as by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin, using mosquito netting while resting, and/or the application of insect repellent (DEET being the most effective).

Chronic diseases – such as asthma, sickle cell anemia, and diabetes mellitus – increase the risk of developing a severe form of the disease. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex and high body mass index. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. Subsequent re-infection with a different serotype increases the risk of severe complications due to a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).The exact mechanism of ADE is not fully understood. It appears that ADE occurs when the antibodies generated during an immune response recognize and bind to a pathogen, but they fail to neutralize it. Instead, the antibody-virus complex has an enhanced ability to bind to the Fcγ receptors of the target immune cells, enabling the virus to infect the cell and reproduce itself.

=== Mechanism of infection ===
When a dengue virus carrying mosquito bites a person, the virus enters the skin together with the mosquito&#x27;s saliva. The virus infects nearby skin cells called keratinocytes, as well as specialized immune cells located in the skin, called Langerhans cells. The Langerhans cells migrate to the lymph nodes, where the infection spreads to white blood cells, and reproduces inside the cells while they move throughout the body.

The white blood cells respond by producing several signaling proteins, such as cytokines and interferons, which are responsible for many of the symptoms, such as the fever, the flu-like symptoms, and the severe pains. In severe infection, the virus production inside the body is greatly increased, and many more organs (such as the liver and the bone marrow) can be affected. Fluid from the bloodstream leaks through the wall of small blood vessels into body cavities due to increased capillary permeability. As a result, blood volume decreases, and the blood pressure becomes so low that it cannot supply sufficient blood to vital organs. The spread of the virus to the bone marrow leads to reduced numbers of platelets, which are necessary for effective blood clotting; this increases the risk of bleeding, the other major complication of dengue fever.

== Prevention ==

=== Vector control ===
The principal risk for infection with dengue is the bite of an infected mosquito. This is more probable in areas where the disease is endemic, especially where there is high population density, poor sanitation, and standing water where mosquitoes can breed. It can be mitigated by taking steps to avoid bites such as by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin, using mosquito netting while resting, and/or the application of insect repellent (DEET being the most effective); it is also advisable to treat clothing, nets and tents with 0.5% permethrin.

Protection of the home can be achieved with door and window screens, by using air conditioning, and by regularly emptying and cleaning all receptacles both indoors and outdoors which may accumulate water (such as buckets, planters, pools or trashcans).

The primary method of controlling &quot;A. aegypti&quot; is by eliminating its habitats. This is done by eliminating open sources of water, or if this is not possible, by adding insecticides or biological control agents to these areas. Generalized spraying with organophosphate or pyrethroid insecticides, while sometimes done, is not thought to be effective. Reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control, given the concerns of negative health effects from insecticides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents. Ideally, mosquito control would be a community activity, e.g. when all members of a community clear blocked gutters and street drains and keep their yards free of containers with standing water. If residences have direct water connections this eliminates the need for wells or street pumps and water-carrying containers.

=== Vaccine ===
As of March 2024, there are two vaccines to protect against dengue infection; Dengvaxia and Qdenga.

Dengvaxia (formerly CYD-TDV) became available in 2015, and is approved for use in the US, EU and in some Asian and Latin American countries. It is an attenuated virus, is suitable for individuals aged 6–45 years and protects against all four serotypes of dengue. Due to safety concerns about antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), it should only be given to individuals who have previously been infected with dengue, in order to protect them from reinfection. It is given subcutaneously as three doses at six month intervals.

Qdenga (formerly TAK-003) completed clinical trials in 2022 and was approved for use in the European Union in December 2022; it has been approved by a number of other countries including Indonesia and Brazil, and has been recommended by the SAGE committee of the World Health Organization. It is indicated for the prevention of dengue disease in individuals four years of age and older, and can be administered to people who have not been previously infected with dengue. It is a live attenuated vaccine containing the four serotypes of dengue virus, administered subcutaneously as two doses three months apart.

== Severe disease ==
The World Health Organization&#x27;s International Classification of Diseases divides dengue fever into two classes: uncomplicated and severe. Severe dengue is defined as that associated with severe bleeding, severe organ dysfunction, or severe plasma leakage.

Severe dengue can develop suddenly, sometimes after a few days as the fever subsides. Leakage of plasma from the capillaries results in extreme low blood pressure and hypovolemic shock; Patients with severe plasma leakage may have fluid accumulation in the lungs or abdomen, insufficient protein in the blood, or thickening of the blood. Severe dengue is a medical emergency which can cause damage to organs, leading to multiple organ failure and death.

== Diagnosis ==
Mild cases of dengue fever can easily be confused with several common diseases including Influenza, measles, chikungunya, and zika. Dengue, chikungunya and zika share the same mode of transmission (&quot;Aedes&quot; mosquitoes) and are often endemic in the same regions, so that it is possible to be infected simultaneously by more than one disease. For travellers, dengue fever diagnosis should be considered in anyone who develops a fever within two weeks of being in the tropics or subtropics.

Warning symptoms of severe dengue include abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, odema, bleeding, lethargy, and liver enlargement. Once again, these symptoms can be confused with other diseases such as malaria, gastroenteritis, leptospirosis, and typhus.

Blood tests can be used to confirm a diagnosis of dengue. During the first few days of infection, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can be used to detect the NS1 antigen; however this antigen is produced by all flaviviruses. Four or five days into the infection, it is possible to reliably detect anti-dengue IgM antibodies, but this does not determine the serotype. Nucleic acid amplification tests provide the most reliable method of diagnosis.

== Treatment ==

As of July 2024, there is no specific antiviral treatment available for dengue fever.

Most cases of dengue fever have mild symptoms, and recovery takes place in a few days. No treatment is required for these cases. Acetaminophen (Paracetamol, Tylenol) may be used to relieve mild fever or pain. Other common pain relievers, including aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) should be avoided as they can increase the risk of bleeding complications.

For moderate illness, those who can drink, are passing urine, have no warning signs and are otherwise reasonably healthy can be monitored carefully at home. Supportive care with analgesics, fluid replacement, and bed rest are recommended.

Severe dengue is a life-threatening emergency, requiring hospitalization and potentially intensive care. Warning signs include dehydration, decreasing platelets and increasing hematocrit. Treatment modes include intravenous fluids, and transfusion with platelets or plasma.

== Prognosis ==

Most people with dengue recover without any ongoing problems. The risk of death among those with severe dengue is 0.8–2.5%, and with adequate treatment this is less than 1%. However, those who develop significantly low blood pressure may have a fatality rate of up to 26%. The risk of death among children less than five years old is four times greater than among those over the age of 10. Elderly people are also at higher risk of a poor outcome.

== Epidemiology ==
As of March 2023, dengue is endemic in more than 100 countries with cases reported in every continent with the exception of Antarctica. The Americas, Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions are the most seriously affected. It is difficult to estimate the full extent of the disease, as many cases are mild and not correctly diagnosed. WHO currently estimates that 3.9 billion people are at risk of dengue infection. In 2013, it was estimated that 390 million dengue infections occur every year, with 500,000 of these developing severe symptoms and 25,000 deaths.

Generally, areas where dengue is endemic have only one serotype of the virus in circulation. The disease is said to be hyperendemic in areas where more than one serotype is circulating; this increases the risk of severe disease on a second or subsequent infection.

Infections are most commonly acquired in urban environments where the virus is primarily transmitted by the mosquito species &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot;. This species has adapted to the urban environment, is generally found close to human habitation, prefers humans as its host, and takes advantage of small bodies of standing water (such as tanks and buckets) in which to breed. In rural settings the virus is transmitted to humans by &quot;A. aegypti&quot; and other related mosquitoes such as &quot;Aedes albopictus&quot;. Both these species have expanding ranges. There are two subspecies of &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot;, where &quot;Aedes aegypti formosus&quot; can be found in natural habitats such as forests and &quot;Aedes aegypti aegypti&quot; has adapted to urban domestic habitats.

Dengue has increased in incidence in recent decades, with WHO recording a ten fold increase between 2010 and 2019 (from 500,000 to 5 million recorded cases). This increase is tied closely to the increasing range of Aedes mosquitoes, which is attributed to a combination of urbanization, population growth, and an increasingly warm climate. In endemic areas, dengue infections peak when rainfall is optimal for mosquito breeding. In October 2023, the first confirmed symptomatic case of locally acquired dengue (i.e. not while travelling) in the US was identified in California.

The disease infects all races, sexes, and ages equally. In endemic areas, the infection is most commonly seen in children who then acquire a lifelong partial immunity.

== History ==

The first historical record of a case of probable dengue fever is in a Chinese medical encyclopedia from the Jin dynasty (266–420) which referred to a &quot;water poison&quot; associated with flying insects.

The principal mosquito vector of dengue, &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot;, spread out of Africa in the 15th to 19th centuries due to the slave trade and consequent expansion of international trading. There have been descriptions of epidemics of dengue-like illness in the 17th century, and it is likely that epidemics in Jakarta, Cairo, and Philadelphia during the 18th century were caused by dengue.

It is assumed that dengue was constantly present in many tropical urban centres throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, even though significant outbreaks were infrequent. The marked spread of dengue during and after the Second World War has been attributed partly to disruption caused by the war, and partly to subsequent urbanisation in south-east Asia. As novel serotypes were introduced to regions already endemic with dengue, outbreaks of severe disease followed. The severe hemorrhagic form of the disease was first reported in the Philippines in 1953; by the 1970s, it had become recognised as a major cause of child mortality in Southeast Asia.

In Central and South America, the Aedes mosquito had been eradicated in the 1950s; however the eradication program was discontinued in the 1970s and the disease re-established itself in the region during the 1980s, becoming hyperendemic and causing significant epidemics.

Dengue has continued to increase in prevalence during the 21st century, as the mosquito vector continues to expand its range. This is attributed partly to continuing urbanisation, and partly to the impact of a warmer climate.

=== Etymology ===

The name came into English in the early 19th century from West Indian Spanish, which borrowed it from the Kiswahili term &quot;dinga&quot; / &quot;denga&quot;, meaning &quot;cramp-like seizure&quot; – the full term of the condition being &quot;ki-dinga pepo&quot;: &quot;a sort of cramp-like seizure (caused by) an evil spirit&quot;. The borrowed term changed to &quot;dengue&quot; in Spanish due to this word existing in Spanish with the meaning &quot;fastidiousness&quot; and this folk etymology referring to the dislike of movement by affected patients. Slaves in the West Indies having contracted dengue were said to have the posture and gait of a dandy, and the disease was known as &quot;dandy fever&quot;.

The term &quot;break-bone fever&quot; was applied by physician and United States Founding Father Benjamin Rush, in a 1789 report of the 1780 epidemic in Philadelphia, due to the associated muscle and joint pains. In the report title he uses the more formal term &quot;bilious remitting fever&quot;. The term dengue fever came into general use only after 1828. Other historical terms include &quot;breakheart fever&quot; and &quot;la dengue&quot;. Terms for severe disease include &quot;infectious thrombocytopenic purpura&quot; and &quot;Philippine&quot;, &quot;Thai&quot;, or &quot;Singapore hemorrhagic fever&quot;.

== Research ==
Research directions include dengue pathogenesis (the process by which the disease develops in humans), as well as the biology, ecology and behaviour of the mosquito vector. Improved diagnostics would enable faster and more appropriate treatment. Attempts are ongoing to develop an antiviral medicine targeting the NS3 or NS5 proteins.

In addition to the two vaccines which are already available, several vaccine candidates are in development.

== Effects of climate change ==
Rising temperatures and altered rainfall patterns are expanding the season and habitats of Aedes mosquitoes, the primary vectors of the disease. In India, a study has developed an early warning system that analyzes regional climate factors—such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity—to predict potential dengue outbreaks two months in advance, enhancing preparedness and response strategies. Future projections indicate that dengue transmission risk will continue to rise with the rise in temperatures.

== Society and culture ==

=== Blood donation ===

Outbreaks of dengue fever increase the need for blood products while decreasing the number of potential blood donors due to potential infection with the virus. Someone who has a dengue infection is typically not allowed to donate blood for at least the next six months.

=== Public awareness ===

International Anti-Dengue Day is observed every year on 15 June in a number of countries. The idea was first agreed upon in 2010 with the first event held in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2011. Further events were held in 2012 in Yangon, Myanmar, and in 2013 in Vietnam. Goals are to increase public awareness about dengue, mobilize resources for its prevention and control and, to demonstrate the Southeast Asian region&#x27;s commitment in tackling the disease. Efforts are ongoing as of 2019 to make it a global event.

The Philippines has an awareness month in June since 1998.

A National Dengue Day is held in India annually on 16 May.

=== Economic burden ===
A study estimated that the global burden of dengue in 2013 amounted to US$8.9 billion.
