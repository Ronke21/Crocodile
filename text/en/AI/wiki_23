<text>In Euclidean geometry, two objects are similar if they have the same shape, or if one has the same shape as the mirror image of the other. More precisely, one can be obtained from the other by uniformly scaling (enlarging or reducing), possibly with additional translation, rotation and reflection. This means that either object can be rescaled, repositioned, and reflected, so as to coincide precisely with the other object. If two objects are similar, each is congruent to the result of a particular uniform scaling of the other.

For example, all circles are similar to each other, all squares are similar to each other, and all equilateral triangles are similar to each other. On the other hand, ellipses are not all similar to each other, rectangles are not all similar to each other, and isosceles triangles are not all similar to each other. This is because two ellipses can have different width to height ratios, two rectangles can have different length to breadth ratios, and two isosceles triangles can have different base angles. 

If two angles of a triangle have measures equal to the measures of two angles of another triangle, then the triangles are similar. Corresponding sides of similar polygons are in proportion, and corresponding angles of similar polygons have the same measure.

Two congruent shapes are similar, with a scale factor of 1. However, some school textbooks specifically exclude congruent triangles from their definition of similar triangles by insisting that the sizes must be different if the triangles are to qualify as similar.

==Similar triangles==
Two triangles, and are similar if and only if corresponding angles have the same measure: this implies that they are similar if and only if the lengths of corresponding sides are proportional. It can be shown that two triangles having congruent angles (&quot;equiangular triangles&quot;) are similar, that is, the corresponding sides can be proved to be proportional. This is known as the AAA similarity theorem. Note that the &quot;AAA&quot; is a mnemonic: each one of the three A&#x27;s refers to an &quot;angle&quot;. Due to this theorem, several authors simplify the definition of similar triangles to only require that the corresponding three angles are congruent.

There are several criteria each of which is necessary and sufficient for two triangles to be similar:

*Any two pairs of angles are congruent, which in Euclidean geometry implies that all three angles are congruent:

::If is equal in measure to and is equal in measure to then this implies that is equal in measure to and the triangles are similar.

*All the corresponding sides are proportional:

formula_1 
:This is equivalent to saying that one triangle (or its mirror image) is an enlargement of the other.

*Any two pairs of sides are proportional, and the angles included between these sides are congruent:
formula_2
:This is known as the SAS similarity criterion. The &quot;SAS&quot; is a mnemonic: each one of the two S&#x27;s refers to a &quot;side&quot;; the A refers to an &quot;angle&quot; between the two sides.

Symbolically, we write the similarity and dissimilarity of two triangles and as follows:

formula_3

There are several elementary results concerning similar triangles in Euclidean geometry:
* Any two equilateral triangles are similar.
* Two triangles, both similar to a third triangle, are similar to each other (transitivity of similarity of triangles).
* Corresponding altitudes of similar triangles have the same ratio as the corresponding sides.
* Two right triangles are similar if the hypotenuse and one other side have lengths in the same ratio. There are several equivalent conditions in this case, such as the right triangles having an acute angle of the same measure, or having the lengths of the legs (sides) being in the same proportion.

Given a triangle and a line segment one can, with a ruler and compass, find a point such that . The statement that point satisfying this condition exists is Wallis&#x27;s postulate and is logically equivalent to Euclid&#x27;s parallel postulate. In hyperbolic geometry (where Wallis&#x27;s postulate is false) similar triangles are congruent.

In the axiomatic treatment of Euclidean geometry given by George David Birkhoff (see Birkhoff&#x27;s axioms) the SAS similarity criterion given above was used to replace both Euclid&#x27;s parallel postulate and the SAS axiom which enabled the dramatic shortening of Hilbert&#x27;s axioms.

Similar triangles provide the basis for many synthetic (without the use of coordinates) proofs in Euclidean geometry. Among the elementary results that can be proved this way are: the angle bisector theorem, the geometric mean theorem, Ceva&#x27;s theorem, Menelaus&#x27;s theorem and the Pythagorean theorem. Similar triangles also provide the foundations for right triangle trigonometry.

==Other similar polygons==

The concept of similarity extends to polygons with more than three sides. Given any two similar polygons, corresponding sides taken in the same sequence (even if clockwise for one polygon and counterclockwise for the other) are proportional and corresponding angles taken in the same sequence are equal in measure. However, proportionality of corresponding sides is not by itself sufficient to prove similarity for polygons beyond triangles (otherwise, for example, all rhombi would be similar). Likewise, equality of all angles in sequence is not sufficient to guarantee similarity (otherwise all rectangles would be similar). A sufficient condition for similarity of polygons is that corresponding sides and diagonals are proportional.

For given , all regular -gons are similar.

==Similar curves==
Several types of curves have the property that all examples of that type are similar to each other. These include:
*Lines (any two lines are even congruent)
*Line segments
*Circles
*Parabolas
*Hyperbolas of a specific eccentricity
*Ellipses of a specific eccentricity
*Catenaries
*Graphs of the logarithm function for different bases
*Graphs of the exponential function for different bases
*Logarithmic spirals are self-similar

==In Euclidean space==
A similarity (also called a similarity transformation or similitude) of a Euclidean space is a bijection from the space onto itself that multiplies all distances by the same positive real number , so that for any two points and we have

:formula_4

where is the Euclidean distance from to . The scalar has many names in the literature including; the &quot;ratio of similarity&quot;, the &quot;stretching factor&quot; and the &quot;similarity coefficient&quot;. When a similarity is called an isometry (rigid transformation). Two sets are called similar if one is the image of the other under a similarity.

As a map a similarity of ratio takes the form

:formula_5

where is an orthogonal matrix and is a translation vector.

Similarities preserve planes, lines, perpendicularity, parallelism, midpoints, inequalities between distances and line segments. Similarities preserve angles but do not necessarily preserve orientation, &quot;direct similitudes&quot; preserve orientation and &quot;opposite similitudes&quot; change it.

The similarities of Euclidean space form a group under the operation of composition called the &quot;similarities group&quot; . The direct similitudes form a normal subgroup of and the Euclidean group of isometries also forms a normal subgroup. The similarities group is itself a subgroup of the affine group, so every similarity is an affine transformation.
One can view the Euclidean plane as the complex plane, that is, as a 2-dimensional space over the reals. The 2D similarity transformations can then be expressed in terms of complex arithmetic and are given by 
*formula_6 (direct similitudes), and 
*formula_7 (opposite similitudes), 
where and are complex numbers, . When , these similarities are isometries.

== Area ratio and volume ratio ==

The ratio between the areas of similar figures is equal to the square of the ratio of corresponding lengths of those figures (for example, when the side of a square or the radius of a circle is multiplied by three, its area is multiplied by nine — i.e. by three squared). The altitudes of similar triangles are in the same ratio as corresponding sides. If a triangle has a side of length and an altitude drawn to that side of length then a similar triangle with corresponding side of length will have an altitude drawn to that side of length . The area of the first triangle is formula_8 while the area of the similar triangle will be 
formula_9
Similar figures which can be decomposed into similar triangles will have areas related in the same way. The relationship holds for figures that are not rectifiable as well.

The ratio between the volumes of similar figures is equal to the cube of the ratio of corresponding lengths of those figures (for example, when the edge of a cube or the radius of a sphere is multiplied by three, its volume is multiplied by 27 — i.e. by three cubed).

Galileo&#x27;s square–cube law concerns similar solids. If the ratio of similitude (ratio of corresponding sides) between the solids is , then the ratio of surface areas of the solids will be , while the ratio of volumes will be .

==Similarity with a center==
If a similarity has exactly one invariant point: a point that the similarity keeps unchanged, then this only point is called &quot;center&quot; of the similarity.

On the first image below the title, on the left, one or another similarity shrinks a regular polygon into a concentric one, the vertices of which are each on a side of the previous polygon. This rotational reduction is repeated, so the initial polygon is extended into an abyss of regular polygons. The center of the similarity is the common center of the successive polygons. A red segment joins a vertex of the initial polygon to its image under the similarity, followed by a red segment going to the following image of vertex, and so on to form a spiral. Actually we can see more than three direct similarities on this first image, because every regular polygon is invariant under certain direct similarities, more precisely certain rotations the center of which is the center of the polygon, and a composition of direct similarities is also a direct similarity. For example we see the image of the initial regular pentagon under a homothety of negative ratio , which is a similarity of ±180° angle and a positive ratio equal to .

Below the title on the right, the second image shows a similarity decomposed into a rotation and a homothety. Similarity and rotation have the same angle of +135 degrees modulo 360 degrees. Similarity and homothety have the same ratio of multiplicative inverse of the ratio (square root of 2) of the inverse similarity. Point is the common center of the three transformations: rotation, homothety and similarity. For example point is the image of under the rotation, and point is the image of under the homothety, more briefly
formula_10
by naming , and the previous rotation, homothety and similarity, with “&quot; like &quot;Direct&quot;.

This direct similarity that transforms triangle into triangle can be decomposed into a rotation and a homothety of same center in several manners. For example, , the last decomposition being only represented on the image. To get we can also compose in any order a rotation of –45° angle and a homothety of ratio 

With &quot;&quot; like &quot;Mirror&quot; and &quot;&quot; like &quot;Indirect&quot;, if is the reflection with respect to line , then is the indirect similarity that transforms segment like into segment , but transforms point into and point into itself. Square is the image of under similarity of ratio Point is the center of this similarity because any point being invariant under it fulfills formula_11 only possible if , otherwise written .

How to construct the center of direct similarity from square , how to find point center of a rotation of +135° angle that transforms ray into ray ? This is an inscribed angle problem plus a question of orientation. The set of points such that formula_12 is an arc of circle that joins and , of which the two radius leading to and form a central angle of . This set of points is the blue quarter of circle of center inside square . In the same manner, point is a member of the blue quarter of circle of center inside square . So point is the intersection point of these two quarters of circles.

==In general metric spaces==
In a general metric space , an exact similitude is a function from the metric space into itself that multiplies all distances by the same positive scalar , called &#x27;s contraction factor, so that for any two points and we have

formula_13

Weaker versions of similarity would for instance have be a bi-Lipschitz function and the scalar a limit

formula_14

This weaker version applies when the metric is an effective resistance on a topologically self-similar set.

A self-similar subset of a metric space is a set for which there exists a finite set of similitudes with contraction factors such that is the unique compact subset of for which

formula_15

These self-similar sets have a self-similar measure with dimension given by the formula

formula_16

which is often (but not always) equal to the set&#x27;s Hausdorff dimension and packing dimension. If the overlaps between the are &quot;small&quot;, we have the following simple formula for the measure:

formula_17

==Topology==

In topology, a metric space can be constructed by defining a similarity instead of a distance. The similarity is a function such that its value is greater when two points are closer (contrary to the distance, which is a measure of dissimilarity: the closer the points, the lesser the distance).

The definition of the similarity can vary among authors, depending on which properties are desired. The basic common properties are
# Positive defined:
formula_18
# Majored by the similarity of one element on itself (auto-similarity):
formula_19

More properties can be invoked, such as:
* Reflectivity: formula_20 or
* Finiteness: formula_21 
The upper value is often set at 1 (creating a possibility for a probabilistic interpretation of the similitude).

Note that, in the topological sense used here, a similarity is a kind of measure. This usage is not the same as the &quot;similarity transformation&quot; of the and sections of this article.

==Self-similarity==
Self-similarity means that a pattern is non-trivially similar to itself, e.g., the set of numbers of the form where ranges over all integers. When this set is plotted on a logarithmic scale it has one-dimensional translational symmetry: adding or subtracting the logarithm of two to the logarithm of one of these numbers produces the logarithm of another of these numbers. In the given set of numbers themselves, this corresponds to a similarity transformation in which the numbers are multiplied or divided by two.

==Psychology==

The intuition for the notion of geometric similarity already appears in human children, as can be seen in their drawings.

<text>Distance is a numerical or occasionally qualitative measurement of how far apart objects, points, people, or ideas are. In physics or everyday usage, distance may refer to a physical length or an estimation based on other criteria (e.g. &quot;two counties over&quot;). The term is also frequently used metaphorically to mean a measurement of the amount of difference between two similar objects (such as statistical distance between probability distributions or edit distance between strings of text) or a degree of separation (as exemplified by distance between people in a social network). Most such notions of distance, both physical and metaphorical, are formalized in mathematics using the notion of a metric space.

In the social sciences, distance can refer to a qualitative measurement of separation, such as social distance or psychological distance.

==Distances in physics and geometry==

The distance between physical locations can be defined in different ways in different contexts.

===Straight-line or Euclidean distance===
The distance between two points in physical space is the length of a straight line between them, which is the shortest possible path. This is the usual meaning of distance in classical physics, including Newtonian mechanics. 

Straight-line distance is formalized mathematically as the Euclidean distance in two- and three-dimensional space. In Euclidean geometry, the distance between two points and is often denoted formula_1. In coordinate geometry, Euclidean distance is computed using the Pythagorean theorem. The distance between points and in the plane is given by:
formula_2
Similarly, given points (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;y&quot;1, &quot;z&quot;1) and (&quot;x&quot;2, &quot;y&quot;2, &quot;z&quot;2) in three-dimensional space, the distance between them is:
formula_3
This idea generalizes to higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces.

==== Measurement ====

There are many ways of measuring straight-line distances. For example, it can be done directly using a ruler, or indirectly with a radar (for long distances) or interferometry (for very short distances). The cosmic distance ladder is a set of ways of measuring extremely long distances.

===Shortest-path distance on a curved surface===

The straight-line distance between two points on the surface of the Earth is not very useful for most purposes, since we cannot tunnel straight through the Earth&#x27;s mantle. Instead, one typically measures the shortest path along the surface of the Earth, as the crow flies. This is approximated mathematically by the great-circle distance on a sphere.

More generally, the shortest path between two points along a curved surface is known as a geodesic. The arc length of geodesics gives a way of measuring distance from the perspective of an ant or other flightless creature living on that surface.

===Effects of relativity===

In the theory of relativity, because of phenomena such as length contraction and the relativity of simultaneity, distances between objects depend on a choice of inertial frame of reference. On galactic and larger scales, the measurement of distance is also affected by the expansion of the universe. In practice, a number of distance measures are used in cosmology to quantify such distances.

===Other spatial distances===

Unusual definitions of distance can be helpful to model certain physical situations, but are also used in theoretical mathematics:
* In practice, one is often interested in the travel distance between two points along roads, rather than as the crow flies. In a grid plan, the travel distance between street corners is given by the Manhattan distance: the number of east–west and north–south blocks one must traverse to get between those two points.
* Chessboard distance, formalized as Chebyshev distance, is the minimum number of moves a king must make on a chessboard in order to travel between two squares.

==Metaphorical distances==
Many abstract notions of distance used in mathematics, science and engineering represent a degree of difference or separation between similar objects. This page gives a few examples.

===Statistical distances===

In statistics and information geometry, statistical distances measure the degree of difference between two probability distributions. There are many kinds of statistical distances, typically formalized as divergences; these allow a set of probability distributions to be understood as a geometrical object called a statistical manifold. The most elementary is the squared Euclidean distance, which is minimized by the least squares method; this is the most basic Bregman divergence. The most important in information theory is the relative entropy (Kullback–Leibler divergence), which allows one to analogously study maximum likelihood estimation geometrically; this is an example of both an &quot;f&quot;-divergence and a Bregman divergence (and in fact the only example which is both). Statistical manifolds corresponding to Bregman divergences are flat manifolds in the corresponding geometry, allowing an analog of the Pythagorean theorem (which holds for squared Euclidean distance) to be used for linear inverse problems in inference by optimization theory.

Other important statistical distances include the Mahalanobis distance and the energy distance.

===Edit distances===
In computer science, an edit distance or string metric between two strings measures how different they are. For example, the words &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;dot&quot;, which differ by just one letter, are closer than &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;cat&quot;, which have no letters in common. This idea is used in spell checkers and in coding theory, and is mathematically formalized in a number of different ways, including Levenshtein distance, Hamming distance, Lee distance, and Jaro–Winkler distance.

===Distance in graph theory===

In a graph, the distance between two vertices is measured by the length of the shortest edge path between them. For example, if the graph represents a social network, then the idea of six degrees of separation can be interpreted mathematically as saying that the distance between any two vertices is at most six. Similarly, the Erdős number and the Bacon number—the number of collaborative relationships away a person is from prolific mathematician Paul Erdős and actor Kevin Bacon, respectively—are distances in the graphs whose edges represent mathematical or artistic collaborations.

===In the social sciences===
In psychology, human geography, and the social sciences, distance is often theorized not as an objective numerical measurement, but as a qualitative description of a subjective experience. For example, psychological distance is &quot;the different ways in which an object might be removed from&quot; the self along dimensions such as &quot;time, space, social distance, and hypotheticality&quot;. In sociology, social distance describes the separation between individuals or social groups in society along dimensions such as social class, race/ethnicity, gender or sexuality.

==Mathematical formalization==

Most of the notions of distance between two points or objects described above are examples of the mathematical idea of a metric. A &quot;metric&quot; or &quot;distance function&quot; is a function which takes pairs of points or objects to real numbers and satisfies the following rules:
# The distance between an object and itself is always zero.
# The distance between distinct objects is always positive.
# Distance is symmetric: the distance from to is always the same as the distance from to .
# Distance satisfies the triangle inequality: if , , and are three objects, then formula_4 This condition can be described informally as &quot;intermediate stops can&#x27;t speed you up.&quot;
As an exception, many of the divergences used in statistics are not metrics.

==Distance between sets==
There are multiple ways of measuring the physical distance between objects that consist of more than one point:
* One may measure the distance between representative points such as the center of mass; this is used for astronomical distances such as the Earth–Moon distance.
* One may measure the distance between the closest points of the two objects; in this sense, the altitude of an airplane or spacecraft is its distance from the Earth. The same sense of distance is used in Euclidean geometry to define distance from a point to a line, distance from a point to a plane, or, more generally, perpendicular distance between affine subspaces.
: Even more generally, this idea can be used to define the distance between two subsets of a metric space. The distance between sets and is the infimum of the distances between any two of their respective points:formula_5 This does not define a metric on the set of such subsets: the distance between overlapping sets is zero, and this distance does not satisfy the triangle inequality for any metric space with two or more points (consider the triple of sets consisting of two distinct singletons and their union).
* The Hausdorff distance between two subsets of a metric space can be thought of as measuring how far they are from perfectly overlapping. Somewhat more precisely, the Hausdorff distance between and is either the distance from to the farthest point of , or the distance from to the farthest point of , whichever is larger. (Here &quot;farthest point&quot; must be interpreted as a supremum.) The Hausdorff distance defines a metric on the set of compact subsets of a metric space.

==Related ideas==
The word distance is also used for related concepts that are not encompassed by the description &quot;a numerical measurement of how far apart points or objects are&quot;.

===Distance travelled===
The distance travelled by an object is the length of a specific path travelled between two points, such as the distance walked while navigating a maze. This can even be a closed distance along a closed curve which starts and ends at the same point, such as a ball thrown straight up, or the Earth when it completes one orbit. This is formalized mathematically as the arc length of the curve.

The distance travelled may also be signed: a &quot;forward&quot; distance is positive and a &quot;backward&quot; distance is negative.

Circular distance is the distance traveled by a point on the circumference of a wheel, which can be useful to consider when designing vehicles or mechanical gears (see also odometry). The circumference of the wheel is ; if the radius is 1, each revolution of the wheel causes a vehicle to travel radians.

===Displacement and directed distance===
The displacement in classical physics measures the change in position of an object during an interval of time. While distance is a scalar quantity, or a magnitude, displacement is a vector quantity with both magnitude and direction. In general, the vector measuring the difference between two locations (the relative position) is sometimes called the directed distance. For example, the directed distance from the New York City Main Library flag pole to the Statue of Liberty flag pole has: 
* A starting point: library flag pole
* An ending point: statue flag pole
* A direction: -38°
* A distance: 8.72 km

<doc id="39380" wikidata="Q150862" url="?curid=39380" title="Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor">
<text>Maximilian II (31 July 1527 – 12 October 1576) was Holy Roman Emperor from 1564 until his death in 1576. A member of the Austrian House of Habsburg, he was crowned King of Bohemia in Prague on 14 May 1562 and elected King of Germany (King of the Romans) on 24 November 1562. On 8 September 1563, he was crowned King of Hungary and Croatia in the Hungarian capital Pressburg (Pozsony in Hungarian; now Bratislava, Slovakia). On 25 July 1564, he succeeded his father Ferdinand I as Holy Roman Emperor.

Maximilian&#x27;s rule was shaped by the confessionalization process after the 1555 Peace of Augsburg. Though a Habsburg and a Catholic, he approached the Lutheran Imperial estates with a view to overcome the denominational schism, which ultimately failed. He also was faced with the ongoing Ottoman–Habsburg wars and rising conflicts with his Spanish Habsburg cousins.

According to Fichtner, Maximilian failed to achieve his three major aims: rationalizing the government structure, unifying Christianity, and evicting the Turks from Hungary. Peter Marshall opines that it is wrong to dismiss Maximilian as a failure. According to Marshall, through his religious tolerance as well as his encouragement of arts and sciences, he succeeded in maintaining a precarious peace.

==Biography==

Maximilian was born in Vienna, Austria, the second child and eldest son of the Habsburg King Ferdinand I, younger brother of Emperor Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and the Jagiellonian Princess Anne of Bohemia and Hungary (1503–1547). He was named after his great-grandfather, Emperor Maximilian I. At the time of his birth, his father Ferdinand succeeded his brother-in-law King Louis II in the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Kingdom of Hungary, greatly expanding the Habsburg monarchy.

Having spent his childhood years at his father&#x27;s court in Innsbruck, Tyrol, Maximilian was educated principally in Italy. Among his teachers were humanist scholars like Kaspar Ursinus Velius and Georg Tannstetter. He also came in contact with the Lutheran teaching and early on corresponded with the Protestant prince Augustus of Saxony. From the age of 17, he gained some experience of warfare during the Italian War campaign of his uncle Charles V against King Francis I of France in 1544, and also during the Schmalkaldic War. Upon Charles&#x27; victory in the 1547 Battle of Mühlberg, Maximilian put in a good word for the Schmalkaldic leaders, Elector John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony and Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, and soon began to take part in Imperial business.

===Heir apparent===
On 13 September 1548 Emperor Charles V married Maximilian to Charles&#x27;s daughter (Maximilian&#x27;s cousin) Maria of Spain in the Castile residence of Valladolid. By the marriage his uncle intended to strengthen the ties with the Spanish branch of the Habsburgs, but also to consolidate his nephew&#x27;s Catholic faith. Maximilian temporarily acted as the emperor&#x27;s representative in Spain, however not as stadtholder of the Habsburg Netherlands as he had hoped for. To his indignation, King Ferdinand appointed his younger brother Ferdinand II administrator in the Kingdom of Bohemia, nevertheless Maximilian&#x27;s right of succession as the future king was recognised in 1549. He returned to Germany in December 1550 in order to take part in the discussion over the Imperial succession.

Maximilian&#x27;s relations with his uncle worsened, as Charles V, again embattled by rebellious Protestant princes led by Elector Maurice of Saxony, wished his son Philip II of Spain to succeed him as emperor. However, Charles&#x27; brother Ferdinand, who had already been elected as the next occupant of the imperial throne, and his son Maximilian objected to this proposal. Maximilian sought the support of the German princes such as Albert V, Duke of Bavaria and even contacted Protestant leaders like Maurice of Saxony and Christoph, Duke of Württemberg. At length a compromise was reached: Philip was to succeed Ferdinand, but during the former&#x27;s reign Maximilian, as King of the Romans, was to govern Germany. This arrangement was not carried out, and is only important because the insistence of the emperor seriously disturbed the harmonious relations that had hitherto existed between the two branches of the Habsburg family; an illness that befell Maximilian in 1552 was attributed to poison given to him in the interests of his cousin and brother-in-law, Philip II of Spain.

The relationship between the two cousins was uneasy. While Philip had been raised a Spaniard and barely travelled out of the kingdom during his life, Maximilian identified himself as the quintessential German prince and often displayed a strong dislike of Spaniards, whom he considered as intolerant and arrogant. While his cousin was reserved and shy, Maximilian was outgoing and charismatic. His adherence to humanism and religious tolerance put him at odds with Philip who was more committed to the defence of the Catholic faith. Also, he was considered a promising commander, while Philip disliked war and only once personally commanded an army. Nonetheless, the two remained committed to the unity of their dynasty. 

In 1551 Maximilian attended the Council of Trent and the next year took up his residence at the Hofburg palace in Vienna, celebrated by a triumphal return into the city with a large entourage including the elephant Suleiman. While his father Ferdinand concluded the 1552 Treaty of Passau with the Protestant estates and finally reached the Peace of Augsburg in 1555, Maximilian was engaged mainly in the government of the Austrian hereditary lands and in defending them against Ottoman incursions. In Vienna, he had his Hofburg residence extended with the Renaissance &quot;Stallburg&quot; wing, the site of the later Spanish Riding School, and also ordered the construction of Neugebäude Palace in Simmering. In the 1550s, Vienna had more than 50,000 inhabitants, making it the largest city in Central Europe with Prague and before Nuremberg (40,000 inhabitants).

The religious views of the future King of Bohemia had always been somewhat uncertain, and he had probably learned something of Lutheranism in his youth; but his amicable relations with several Protestant princes, which began about the time of the discussion over the succession, were probably due more to political than to religious considerations. However, in Vienna he became very intimate with , a court preacher influenced by Heinrich Bullinger with strong leanings towards Lutheranism, and his religious attitude caused some uneasiness to his father. Fears were freely expressed that he would definitely leave the Catholic Church, and when his father Ferdinand became emperor in 1558 he was prepared to assure Pope Paul IV that his son should not succeed him if he took this step. Eventually Maximilian remained nominally an adherent of the older faith, although his views were tinged with Lutheranism until the end of his life. After several refusals he consented in 1560 to the banishment of Pfauser, and began again to attend the Masses of the Catholic Church.

===Reign===
In November 1562 Maximilian was chosen King of the Romans, or German king, by the electoral college at Frankfurt, where he was crowned a few days later, after assuring the Catholic electors of his fidelity to their faith, and promising the Protestant electors that he would publicly accept the confession of Augsburg when he became emperor. He also took the usual oath to protect the Church, and his election was afterwards confirmed by the papacy. He was the first King of the Romans not to be crowned in Aachen. In September 1563 he was crowned King of Hungary by the Archbishop of Esztergom, Nicolaus Olahus, and on his father&#x27;s death, in July 1564, he succeeded to the empire and to the kingdoms of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia.

The new emperor had already shown that he believed in the necessity for a thorough reform of the Church. He was unable, however, to obtain the consent of Pope Pius IV to the marriage of the clergy, and in 1568 the concession of communion in both kinds to the laity was withdrawn. On his part Maximilian granted religious liberty to the Lutheran nobles and knights in Austria, and refused to allow the publication of the decrees of the Council of Trent. Amidst general expectations on the part of the Protestants he met his first summoned Diet of Augsburg in March 1566. He refused to accede to the demands of the Lutheran princes; on the other hand, although the increase of sectarianism was discussed, no decisive steps were taken to suppress it, and the only result of the meeting was a grant of assistance for the war with the Turks, which had just been renewed. Maximilian gathered a large army and marched to fight the Ottomans. The Ottomans besieged and conquered Szigetvár in 1566, but their sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent, died of old age during the siege. With neither side winning a decisive engagement, Maximilian&#x27;s ambassadors Antun Vrančić and Christoph Teuffenbach met with the Ottoman Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha in Adrianople to negotiate a truce in 1568. The terms of the Treaty of Adrianople required the emperor to recognise Ottoman suzerainty over Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia.

Meanwhile, the relations between Maximilian and Philip of Spain had improved, and the emperor&#x27;s increasingly cautious and moderate attitude in religious matters was doubtless because the death of Philip&#x27;s son, Don Carlos, had opened the way for the succession of Maximilian, or of one of his sons, to the Spanish throne. Evidence of this friendly feeling was given in 1570, when the emperor&#x27;s daughter, Anna, became the fourth wife of Philip; but Maximilian was unable to moderate the harsh proceedings of the Spanish king against the revolting inhabitants of the Netherlands. In 1570 the emperor met the Diet of Speyer and asked for aid to place his eastern borders in a state of defence, and also for power to repress the disorder caused by troops in the service of foreign powers passing through Germany. He proposed that his consent should be necessary before any soldiers for foreign service were recruited in the empire; but the estates were unwilling to strengthen the imperial authority, the Protestant princes regarded the suggestion as an attempt to prevent them from assisting their co-religionists in France and the Netherlands, and nothing was done in this direction, although some assistance was voted for the defense of Austria. The religious demands of the Protestants were still unsatisfied, while the policy of toleration had failed to give peace to Austria. Maximilian&#x27;s power was very limited; it was inability rather than unwillingness that prevented him from yielding to the entreaties of Pope Pius V to join in an attack on the Turks both before and after the victory of Lepanto in 1571; and he remained inert while the authority of the empire in north-eastern Europe was threatened.

In 1576, Maximilian was elected by the part of Polish and Lithuanian magnates to be the King of Poland in opposition to Stephan IV Bathory, but he did not manage to become widely accepted there and was forced to leave Poland.

Maximilian died on 12 October 1576 in Regensburg while preparing to invade Poland. On his deathbed he refused to receive the last sacraments of the Church. He is buried in St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague.

By his wife Maria he had a family of ten sons and six daughters. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Rudolf, who had been chosen king of the Romans in October 1575. Another of his sons, Matthias, also became emperor; three others, Ernest, Albert and Maximilian, took some part in the government of the Habsburg territories or of the Netherlands. His eldest daughter, Anna, married Philip II of Spain. Another daughter, Elizabeth, married Charles IX of France.

==Religious policies==
Maximilian&#x27;s policies of religious neutrality and peace in the empire afforded its Roman Catholics and Protestants a breathing space after the first struggles of the Reformation. His reign also saw the high point of Protestantism in Austria and Bohemia and unlike his successors, Maximilian did not try to suppress it.

He disappointed the German Protestant princes by his refusal to invest Lutheran administrators of prince-bishoprics with their imperial fiefs. Yet on a personal basis he granted freedom of worship to the Protestant nobility and worked for reform in the Roman Catholic Church, including the right of priests to marry. This failed because of Spanish opposition.

Maximilian II was a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece.
==Patronage of arts and sciences==

Under Ferdinand I and Maximilian II, the imperial court itself became the centre of humanist scholarship. The court held close ties to the University of Vienna but the university, that reached its summit under Maximilian I, had been severely diminished due to wars and civil disturbances.

In his court, Catholic and Prostestant scholars equally thrived. Many artists and scholars came from Spain, Italy and Spanish Netherlands. Maximilian employed scholars like the botanist Carolus Clusius and the diplomat Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq. Maximilian&#x27;s library curated by Hugo Blotius later became the nucleus of the Austrian National Library. He implemented the Roman School of composition with his court orchestra, however, his plans to win Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina as &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; foundered on financial reasons.

==Marriage and children==

On 13 September 1548, Maximilian married his first cousin Maria of Spain, daughter of Emperor Charles V and Isabella of Portugal. Despite Maria&#x27;s commitment to Habsburg Spain and her strong Catholic manners, the marriage was a happy one. The couple had sixteen children in just nineteen years, but only nine of them lived to adulthood:

#Anna (1 November 1549 – 26 October 1580), who became queen of Spain
#Ferdinand (28 March 1551 – 25 June 1552), who died in early childhood.
#Rudolf (18 July 1552 – 20 January 1612), who became emperor
#Ernest (15 July 1553 – 12 February 1595), who served as governor of the Habsburg Netherlands
#Elisabeth (5 July 1554 – 22 January 1592), who became queen of France
#Marie (27 July 1555 – 25 June 1556), who died in infancy
#Matthias (24 February 1557 – 20 March 1619), who became emperor
#A stillborn son (20 October 1557)
#Maximilian (12 October 1558 – 2 November 1618), who served as grandmaster of the Teutonic Order and administrator of Prussia.
#Albert (15 November 1559 – 13 July 1621), who served as governor of the Habsburg Netherlands
#Wenceslaus (9 March 1561 – 22 September 1578)
#Frederick (21 June 1562 – 16 January 1563), who died in infancy
#Marie (19 February 1564 – 26 March 1564), who died in infancy
#Charles (26 September 1565 – 23 May 1566), who died in infancy
#Margaret (25 January 1567 – 5 July 1633), a nun
#Eleanor (4 November 1568 – 12 March 1580), who died in childhood

<doc id="39382" wikidata="Q17502105" url="?curid=39382" title="Infimum and supremum">
<text>In mathematics, the infimum (abbreviated inf; : infima) of a subset formula_1 of a partially ordered set formula_2 is the greatest element in formula_2 that is less than or equal to each element of formula_4 if such an element exists. If the infimum of formula_1 exists, it is unique, and if &quot;b&quot; is a lower bound of formula_1, then &quot;b&quot; is less than or equal to the infimum of formula_1. Consequently, the term &quot;greatest lower bound&quot; (abbreviated as ) is also commonly used. The supremum (abbreviated sup; : suprema) of a subset formula_1 of a partially ordered set formula_2 is the least element in formula_2 that is greater than or equal to each element of formula_4 if such an element exists. If the supremum of formula_1 exists, it is unique, and if &quot;b&quot; is an upper bound of formula_1, then the supremum of formula_1 is less than or equal to &quot;b&quot;. Consequently, the supremum is also referred to as the &quot;least upper bound&quot; (or ).

The infimum is, in a precise sense, dual to the concept of a supremum. Infima and suprema of real numbers are common special cases that are important in analysis, and especially in Lebesgue integration. However, the general definitions remain valid in the more abstract setting of order theory where arbitrary partially ordered sets are considered.

The concepts of infimum and supremum are close to minimum and maximum, but are more useful in analysis because they better characterize special sets which may have . For instance, the set of positive real numbers formula_15 (not including formula_16) does not have a minimum, because any given element of formula_15 could simply be divided in half resulting in a smaller number that is still in formula_18 There is, however, exactly one infimum of the positive real numbers relative to the real numbers: formula_19 which is smaller than all the positive real numbers and greater than any other real number which could be used as a lower bound. An infimum of a set is always and only defined relative to a superset of the set in question. For example, there is no infimum of the positive real numbers inside the positive real numbers (as their own superset), nor any infimum of the positive real numbers inside the complex numbers with positive real part.

== Formal definition ==
A of a subset formula_1 of a partially ordered set formula_21 is an element formula_22 of formula_2 such that
* formula_24 for all formula_25 
A lower bound formula_26 of formula_1 is called an (or , or ) of formula_1 if
* for all lower bounds formula_22 of formula_1 in formula_31 formula_32 (formula_26 is larger than any other lower bound).

Similarly, an of a subset formula_1 of a partially ordered set formula_21 is an element formula_36 of formula_2 such that
* formula_38 for all formula_25 
An upper bound formula_40 of formula_1 is called a (or , or ) of formula_1 if
* for all upper bounds formula_36 of formula_1 in formula_31 formula_46 (formula_40 is less than any other upper bound).

== Existence and uniqueness ==

Infima and suprema do not necessarily exist. Existence of an infimum of a subset formula_1 of formula_2 can fail if formula_1 has no lower bound at all, or if the set of lower bounds does not contain a greatest element. (An example of this is the subset formula_51 of formula_52. It has upper bounds, such as 1.5, but no supremum in formula_52.)

Consequently, partially ordered sets for which certain infima are known to exist become especially interesting. For instance, a lattice is a partially ordered set in which all subsets have both a supremum and an infimum, and a complete lattice is a partially ordered set in which subsets have both a supremum and an infimum. More information on the various classes of partially ordered sets that arise from such considerations are found in the article on completeness properties.

If the supremum of a subset formula_1 exists, it is unique. If formula_1 contains a greatest element, then that element is the supremum; otherwise, the supremum does not belong to formula_1 (or does not exist). Likewise, if the infimum exists, it is unique. If formula_1 contains a least element, then that element is the infimum; otherwise, the infimum does not belong to formula_1 (or does not exist).

== Relation to maximum and minimum elements ==

The infimum of a subset formula_1 of a partially ordered set formula_31 assuming it exists, does not necessarily belong to formula_61 If it does, it is a minimum or least element of formula_61 Similarly, if the supremum of formula_1 belongs to formula_4 it is a maximum or greatest element of formula_61

For example, consider the set of negative real numbers (excluding zero). This set has no greatest element, since for every element of the set, there is another, larger, element. For instance, for any negative real number formula_66 there is another negative real number formula_67 which is greater. On the other hand, every real number greater than or equal to zero is certainly an upper bound on this set. Hence, formula_16 is the least upper bound of the negative reals, so the supremum is 0. This set has a supremum but no greatest element.

However, the definition of maximal and minimal elements is more general. In particular, a set can have many maximal and minimal elements, whereas infima and suprema are unique.

Whereas maxima and minima must be members of the subset that is under consideration, the infimum and supremum of a subset need not be members of that subset themselves.

=== Minimal upper bounds ===
Finally, a partially ordered set may have many minimal upper bounds without having a least upper bound. Minimal upper bounds are those upper bounds for which there is no strictly smaller element that also is an upper bound. This does not say that each minimal upper bound is smaller than all other upper bounds, it merely is not greater. The distinction between &quot;minimal&quot; and &quot;least&quot; is only possible when the given order is not a total one. In a totally ordered set, like the real numbers, the concepts are the same.

As an example, let formula_1 be the set of all finite subsets of natural numbers and consider the partially ordered set obtained by taking all sets from formula_1 together with the set of integers formula_71 and the set of positive real numbers formula_72 ordered by subset inclusion as above. Then clearly both formula_71 and formula_15 are greater than all finite sets of natural numbers. Yet, neither is formula_15 smaller than formula_71 nor is the converse true: both sets are minimal upper bounds but none is a supremum.

=== Least-upper-bound property ===
The is an example of the aforementioned completeness properties which is typical for the set of real numbers. This property is sometimes called .

If an ordered set formula_1 has the property that every nonempty subset of formula_1 having an upper bound also has a least upper bound, then formula_1 is said to have the least-upper-bound property. As noted above, the set formula_80 of all real numbers has the least-upper-bound property. Similarly, the set formula_71 of integers has the least-upper-bound property; if formula_1 is a nonempty subset of formula_71 and there is some number formula_84 such that every element formula_85 of formula_1 is less than or equal to formula_87 then there is a least upper bound formula_88 for formula_4 an integer that is an upper bound for formula_1 and is less than or equal to every other upper bound for formula_61 A well-ordered set also has the least-upper-bound property, and the empty subset has also a least upper bound: the minimum of the whole set.

An example of a set that the least-upper-bound property is formula_92 the set of rational numbers. Let formula_1 be the set of all rational numbers formula_94 such that formula_95 Then formula_1 has an upper bound (formula_97 for example, or formula_98) but no least upper bound in formula_99: If we suppose formula_100 is the least upper bound, a contradiction is immediately deduced because between any two reals formula_101 and formula_22 (including formula_103 and formula_104) there exists some rational formula_105 which itself would have to be the least upper bound (if formula_106) or a member of formula_1 greater than formula_104 (if formula_109). Another example is the hyperreals; there is no least upper bound of the set of positive infinitesimals.

There is a corresponding ; an ordered set possesses the greatest-lower-bound property if and only if it also possesses the least-upper-bound property; the least-upper-bound of the set of lower bounds of a set is the greatest-lower-bound, and the greatest-lower-bound of the set of upper bounds of a set is the least-upper-bound of the set.

If in a partially ordered set formula_2 every bounded subset has a supremum, this applies also, for any set formula_111 in the function space containing all functions from formula_112 to formula_31 where formula_114 if and only if formula_115 for all formula_116 For example, it applies for real functions, and, since these can be considered special cases of functions, for real formula_84-tuples and sequences of real numbers.

The least-upper-bound property is an indicator of the suprema.

== Infima and suprema of real numbers ==

In analysis, infima and suprema of subsets formula_1 of the real numbers are particularly important. For instance, the negative real numbers do not have a greatest element, and their supremum is formula_16 (which is not a negative real number).
The completeness of the real numbers implies (and is equivalent to) that any bounded nonempty subset formula_1 of the real numbers has an infimum and a supremum. If formula_1 is not bounded below, one often formally writes formula_122 If formula_1 is empty, one writes formula_124

===Properties===

If formula_125 is any set of real numbers then formula_126 if and only if formula_127 and otherwise formula_128 

Set inclusion

If formula_129 are sets of real numbers then formula_130 (if formula_131 this reads as formula_132) and formula_133

Image under functions
If formula_134 is a nonincreasing function, then 
formula_135 and formula_136, where the image is defined as formula_137

Identifying infima and suprema

If the infimum of formula_125 exists (that is, formula_139 is a real number) and if formula_104 is any real number then formula_141 if and only if formula_104 is a lower bound and for every formula_143 there is an formula_144 with formula_145 
Similarly, if formula_146 is a real number and if formula_104 is any real number then formula_148 if and only if formula_104 is an upper bound and if for every formula_143 there is an formula_144 with formula_152

Relation to limits of sequences

If formula_153 is any non-empty set of real numbers then there always exists a non-decreasing sequence formula_154 in formula_1 such that formula_156 Similarly, there will exist a (possibly different) non-increasing sequence formula_157 in formula_1 such that formula_159
In particular, the infimum and supremum of a set belong to its closure if formula_160 then formula_161 and if formula_162 then formula_163

Expressing the infimum and supremum as a limit of a such a sequence allows theorems from various branches of mathematics to be applied. Consider for example the well-known fact from topology that if formula_164 is a continuous function and formula_165 is a sequence of points in its domain that converges to a point formula_166 then formula_167 necessarily converges to formula_168 
It implies that if formula_169 is a real number (where all formula_165 are in formula_1) and if formula_164 is a continuous function whose domain contains formula_1 and formula_174 then 
formula_175
which (for instance) guarantees that formula_176 is an adherent point of the set formula_137
If in addition to what has been assumed, the continuous function formula_164 is also an increasing or non-decreasing function, then it is even possible to conclude that formula_179 
This may be applied, for instance, to conclude that whenever formula_180 is a real (or complex) valued function with domain formula_181 whose sup norm formula_182 is finite, then for every non-negative real number formula_183
formula_184
since the map formula_185 defined by formula_186 is a continuous non-decreasing function whose domain formula_187 always contains formula_188 and formula_189

Although this discussion focused on formula_190 similar conclusions can be reached for formula_191 with appropriate changes (such as requiring that formula_164 be non-increasing rather than non-decreasing). Other norms defined in terms of formula_193 or formula_191 include the weak formula_195 space norms (for formula_196), the norm on Lebesgue space formula_197 and operator norms. Monotone sequences in formula_1 that converge to formula_199 (or to formula_200) can also be used to help prove many of the formula given below, since addition and multiplication of real numbers are continuous operations.

===Arithmetic operations on sets===

The following formulas depend on a notation that conveniently generalizes arithmetic operations on sets. 
Throughout, formula_201 are sets of real numbers. 

Sum of sets

The Minkowski sum of two sets formula_125 and formula_203 of real numbers is the set 
formula_204 
consisting of all possible arithmetic sums of pairs of numbers, one from each set. The infimum and supremum of the Minkowski sum satisfy, if formula_205
formula_206 
and 
formula_207

Product of sets

The multiplication of two sets formula_125 and formula_203 of real numbers is defined similarly to their Minkowski sum:
formula_210

If formula_125 and formula_203 are nonempty sets of positive real numbers then formula_213 and similarly for suprema formula_214

Scalar product of a set

The product of a real number formula_215 and a set formula_203 of real numbers is the set
formula_217

If formula_218 then 
formula_219
while if formula_220 then 
formula_221
In the case formula_222,
one has, if formula_223
formula_224 
Using formula_225 and the notation formula_226 it follows that, 
formula_227

Multiplicative inverse of a set

For any set formula_1 that does not contain formula_19 let
formula_230

If formula_231 is non-empty then 
formula_232 
where this equation also holds when formula_233 if the definition formula_234 is used. 
This equality may alternatively be written as 
formula_235 
Moreover, formula_236 if and only if formula_237 where if formula_238 then formula_239

== Duality ==

If one denotes by formula_240 the partially-ordered set formula_2 with the opposite order relation; that is, for all formula_242 declare: 
formula_243
then infimum of a subset formula_1 in formula_2 equals the supremum of formula_1 in formula_240 and vice versa.

For subsets of the real numbers, another kind of duality holds: formula_248 where formula_249

== Examples ==

=== Infima ===

* The infimum of the set of numbers formula_250 is formula_251 The number formula_252 is a lower bound, but not the greatest lower bound, and hence not the infimum.
* More generally, if a set has a smallest element, then the smallest element is the infimum for the set. In this case, it is also called the minimum of the set.

for any functionals formula_164 and formula_269

The supremum of a subset formula_1 of formula_271 where formula_272 denotes &quot;divides&quot;, is the lowest common multiple of the elements of formula_61

The supremum of a set formula_1 containing subsets of some set formula_112 is the union of the subsets when considering the partially ordered set formula_276, where formula_2 is the power set of formula_112 and formula_279 is subset.

<text>Lando (also known as Landus) was the pope from September 913 to his death March 914. His short pontificate fell during an obscure period in papal and Roman history, the so-called &quot;Saeculum obscurum&quot; (904–964).

According to the &quot;Liber pontificalis&quot;, Lando was born in the Sabina (Papal States), and his father was a wealthy Lombard count named Taino from Fornovo. The &quot;Liber&quot; also claims that his pontificate lasted only four months and twenty-two days. A different list of popes, appended to a continuation of the &quot;Liber pontificalis&quot; at the Abbey of Farfa and quoted by Gregory of Catino in his &quot;Chronicon Farfense&quot; in the twelfth century, gives Lando a pontificate of six months and twenty-six days. This is closer to the duration recorded by Flodoard of Reims, writing in the tenth century, of six months and ten days. The end of his pontificate can be dated to between 5 February 914, when he is mentioned in a document of Ravenna, and late March or early April, when his successor, John X, was elected.

Lando is thought to have been the candidate of Count Theophylact I of Tusculum and Senatrix Theodora, who were the most powerful couple in Rome at the time. The Theophylacti controlled papal finances through their monopoly of the office of &quot;vestararius&quot;, and also controlled the Roman militia and Senate. During Lando&#x27;s reign, Arab raiders, operating from their stronghold on the Garigliano river, destroyed the cathedral of San Salvatore in Vescovio in his native diocese. No document of Lando&#x27;s chancery has survived. The only act of his reign that is recorded is a donation to the diocese of Sabina mentioned in a judicial act of 1431. Lando made the large personal gift in order to restore the cathedral of San Salvatore so that the clergy who were then living at Toffia could return.

Lando was the last pope with a unique name and without regnal number until Pope Francis in 2013.

<text>An engagement or betrothal is the period of time between the declaration of acceptance of a marriage proposal and the marriage itself (which is typically but not always commenced with a wedding). During this period, a couple is said to be fiancés (from ), &#x27;betrothed&#x27;, &#x27;intended&#x27;, &#x27;affianced&#x27;, &#x27;engaged to be married&#x27;, or simply &#x27;engaged&#x27;. Future brides and grooms may be called fiancée (feminine) or fiancé (masculine), &#x27;the betrothed&#x27;, a &#x27;wife-to-be&#x27; or &#x27;husband-to-be&#x27;, respectively. The duration of the courtship varies vastly, and is largely dependent on cultural norms or upon the agreement of the parties involved.

Long engagements were once common in formal arranged marriages, and it was not uncommon for parents betrothing children to arrange marriages many years before the engaged couple were old enough. This is still done in some countries.

Many traditional Christian denominations have optional rites for Christian betrothal (also known as &#x27;blessing an engaged couple&#x27; or &#x27;declaration of intention&#x27;) that bless and ratify the intent of a couple to marry before God and the Church.

==Origin==

The origins of European engagement in marriage practice are found in the Jewish law (Torah), first exemplified by Abraham, and outlined in the last Talmudic tractate of the Nashim (Women) order, where marriage consists of two separate acts, called &quot;erusin&quot; (or &quot;kiddushin&quot;, meaning &quot;sanctification&quot;), which is the betrothal ceremony, and &quot;nissu&#x27;in&quot; or &quot;chupah&quot;, the actual ceremony for the marriage. &quot;Erusin&quot; changes the couple&#x27;s interpersonal status, while &quot;nissu&#x27;in&quot; brings about the legal consequences of the change of status. (However, in the Talmud and other sources of Jewish law there is also a process, called &quot;shiduchin&quot;, corresponding to what today is called engagement. Marrying without such an agreement is considered immoral. To complicate matters, &quot;erusin&quot; in modern Hebrew means engagement, not betrothal.)

This was later adopted in ancient Greece as the &quot;gamos&quot; and &quot;engeysis&quot; rituals, although unlike in Judaism, the contract made in front of witness was only verbal. The giving of a ring was eventually borrowed from Judaism by Roman marriage law, with the fiancé presenting it after swearing the oath of marriage intent, and presenting of the gifts at the engagement party.

== Betrothal ==

Betrothal (also called &#x27;espousal&#x27;) is a formal state of engagement to be married.

Typical steps of a match were the following:
* Negotiation of a match, usually done by the couple&#x27;s families with bride and groom having varying levels of input, from no input, to veto power, to a fuller voice in the selection of marriage partner.
** This is not as widely practiced as it was historically, although it is still common in culturally conservative communities in Israel, India, Africa, and Arab states of the Persian Gulf, although most of these have a requirement that the bride be at least allowed veto power.
* Negotiation of bride price or dowry
** In most cultures evolved from Europe, bride prices or dowries have been reduced to the engagement ring accompanying the marriage contract, while in other cultures, such as those on the Arabian Peninsula, they are still part of negotiating a marriage contract.
* Blessing by the parents and clergy
* Exchange of vows and signing of contracts
** Often one of these is omitted
* Celebration
The exact duration of a betrothal varies according to culture and the participants’ needs and wishes. For adults, it may be anywhere from several hours (when the betrothal is incorporated into the wedding day itself) to a period of several years. A year and a day are common in neo-pagan groups today. In the case of child marriage, betrothal might last from infancy until the age of marriage.

The responsibilities and privileges of betrothal vary. In most cultures, the betrothed couple is expected to spend much time together, learning about each other. In some historical cultures (including colonial North America), the betrothal was essentially a trial marriage, with marriage only being required in cases of conception of a child. Almost all cultures are loosening restrictions against physical contact between partners, even in cultures that normally had strong prohibitions against it. The betrothal period was also considered to be a preparatory time, in which the groom built a house, started a business or otherwise proved his readiness to enter adult society.

In medieval Europe, in canon law, a betrothal could be formed by the exchange of vows in the future tense (&quot;I &quot;will&quot; take you as my wife/husband,&quot; instead of &quot;I take you as my wife/husband&quot;), but sexual intercourse consummated the vows, making a binding marriage rather than a betrothal. Although these betrothals could be concluded with only the vows spoken by the couple, they had legal implications: Richard III of England had his older brother&#x27;s children declared illegitimate on the grounds their father had been betrothed to another woman when he married their mother.

A betrothal is considered to be a &#x27;semi-binding&#x27; contract. Normal reasons for invalidation of a betrothal include:
* Revelation of a prior commitment or marriage
* Evidence of infidelity
* Failure to conceive (in &#x27;trial marriage&#x27; cultures)
* Failure of either party to meet the financial and property stipulations of the betrothal contract

Normally, either party can break a betrothal, though in certain traditions, a financial penalty (such as forfeit of the bride price) applies. In some common law countries, including England and Wales and many US states, it was once possible for the spurned partner (often only the woman) to sue the other for breach of promise or &quot;heart-balm&quot;. This provided some protection in an age where virginity at marriage was considered important and having a failed engagement could damage one&#x27;s reputation, but this tort has become obsolete in most jurisdictions as attitudes to premarital sex have softened and emphasis shifted to allowing people to leave loveless relationships.

===Judaism===
In Jewish weddings during Talmudic times (c.1st century BC – 6th century AD), the two ceremonies of betrothal (&quot;erusin&quot;) and wedding usually took place up to a year apart; the bride lived with her parents until the actual marriage ceremony (&quot;nissuin&quot;), which would take place in a room or tent that the groom had set up for her. Since the Middle Ages the two ceremonies have taken place as a combined ceremony performed in public. The &quot;betrothal&quot; is now generally part of the Jewish wedding ceremony, accomplished when the groom gives the bride the ring or another object of at least nominal value. As mentioned above, betrothal in Judaism is separate from engagement; breaking a betrothal requires a formal divorce, and violation of betrothal is considered adultery.

===Christianity===

In most localities, the Rite of Betrothal (also known as &#x27;blessing an engaged couple&#x27; or &#x27;declaration of intention&#x27;) as a precursor to Holy Matrimony is an optional practice in traditional forms of Christianity today that blesses and ratifies the intention of two Christians to marry one another. Many Christian denominations provide liturgies for Christian betrothal, which often feature prayer, Bible readings, a blessing of the engagement rings (in cultures in which rings are used), and a blessing of the couple. A betrothal makes what a couple promises to one another sanctified by God and the Church. A Christian engagement (betrothal) ceremony, which may be followed with a party, is normative in certain parts of the world, as with the Christians of India and Pakistan.

====Catholic Church====
Historically, betrothal in Roman Catholicism is a formal contract considered as binding as marriage, and a divorce is necessary to terminate a betrothal. Betrothed couples are regarded legally as husband and wife – even before their wedding and physical union.
The concept of an official engagement period in Western European culture may have begun in 1215 at the Fourth Lateran Council, headed by Pope Innocent III, which decreed that &quot;marriages are to be ... announced publicly in the churches by the priests during a suitable and fixed time so that, if legitimate impediments exist, they may be made known.&quot; Such a formal church announcement of the intent to marry is known as banns. In some jurisdictions, reading the banns may be part of one type of legal marriage.

====Protestant Churches====
The Lutheran book of &quot;Liturgical Forms&quot; includes the &quot;Form and Manner of Betrothal in Church&quot;, which can take place in the church or alternatively, in the house of the bride. This rite can be found throughout history, such as in early Lutheran liturgical texts, the Stasbourg C.O. 1604 being an example. &quot;Liturgical Forms&quot; states that The Rite of Betrothal is seen as an &quot;admirable practice of plighting one&#x27;s troth in church, so in keeping with the holiness and importance of marital betrothal as the &quot;incipient marital life&quot;.&quot;

The 2019 Book of Common Prayer, used by Anglican Christian denominations such as the Anglican Church in North America, includes a Christian rite of betrothal called &quot;A Brief Liturgy for the Signing of the Declaration of Intention&quot; in which a Christian couple ratifies their intention before God and the Church to marry. During this liturgy, the following is signed and dated by the engaged couple after the sign of peace:

Following the signing of the declaration of intention, the couple is blessed by the priest:

The Lutheran Churches, the Anglican Communion, the Methodist Churches and the Presbyterian Churches have questions and responses for family members in its Rite of Betrothal, which is sometimes incorporated into the Service of Holy Matrimony itself.

====Orthodox Churches====
In the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Rite of Betrothal is traditionally performed in the narthex (entranceway) of the church, to indicate the couple&#x27;s first entrance into the married estate. The priest blesses the couple and gives them lit candles to hold. Then, after a litany, and a prayer at which everyone bows, he places the bride&#x27;s ring on the ring finger of the groom&#x27;s right hand, and the groom&#x27;s ring on the bride&#x27;s finger. The rings are subsequently exchanged three times, either by the priest or by the best man, after which the priest says a final prayer. Traditionally, the betrothal service takes place at the time the engagement is announced, though in certain localities it may performed immediately before the wedding ceremony itself. The exchange of rings is not a part of the wedding service in the Eastern Churches, but only occurs at the betrothal ceremony. Traditionally, the groom&#x27;s ring is gold and the bride&#x27;s ring is silver.

==Engagement rings==

Customs for engagement rings vary according to time, place, and culture. An engagement ring has historically been uncommon, and when such a gift was given, it was separate from the wedding ring.

The first instance of the tradition of giving a ring for marriage in the Hebrew Bible is in , when a golden nose ring (Chayei Sarah 24:22) was given by Eliezer of Damascus to Rebecca, with Saadiah Gaon also citing as a possible source of the practice in the phrase in &quot;be’nei tabbaot&quot; (children of the rings). The latter case refers to betrothal (see above) rather than engagement; one of the three ways in which betrothal may be effected in Judaism is by the husband giving the bride money or an object of at least nominal value. In fact, it is a long-standing practice within Judaism to contract the betrothal with a ring.

The practice of a marriage ring in Byzantine Empire date back to 3rd century CE.

Romantic rings from the time of the Roman Empire sometimes bore clasped hands symbolizing contract, from which the later Celtic Claddagh symbol (two hands clasping a heart) may have evolved as a symbol of love and commitment between two people. Romans believed the circle was a bond between the two people who were to be married and signified eternity, but was first practiced on the fourth finger/ring finger by the Romans, who believed this finger to be the beginning of the &quot;vena amoris&quot; (&quot;vein of love&quot;), the vein that leads to the heart. In cultures with European origin, and many other countries, an engagement ring is worn following the practice of the Romans who &quot;...wore the ring either on the right middle finger or the left ring [4th] finger, from which, according to ancient Egyptian physicians, a nerve led directly to the heart.&quot; The custom in Continental Europe and other countries is to wear it on the right hand. One historical exception arose in monarchical regimes, in which a nobleman entering into morganatic marriage, a marriage in which the person, usually the woman, of lower rank stayed at the same rank instead of rising ranks, would present their left hand to receive the ring, hence the alternative term &#x27;marriage with the left hand&#x27; (Ger. &quot;Ehe zur linken Hand&quot;), the offspring of such marriages considered to be disinherited from birth.

The modern Western form of the practice of giving or exchanging engagement rings is traditionally thought to have begun in 1477 when Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, gave Mary of Burgundy a diamond ring as an engagement present.

In other countries like Argentina, men and women each wear a ring similar to wedding bands. They are made of silver (&quot;alianza de plata&quot;) when manifesting an informal &quot;boyfriend-girlfriend&quot; relationship, though this first step might not always happen; howbeit depending on finances, this may be the only ring given at all. The gold band (&quot;&quot;anillo de compromiso&quot; or &quot;alianza de oro&quot;) is given to the bride when the commitment is formal and the [optional] diamond ring (&quot;cintillo&quot;&quot;) is reserved for the wedding ceremony when the groom gives it to the bride. The gold band that the groom wore during the engagement – or a new one, as some men choose not to wear them during engagement – is then given to the groom by the bride; and the bride receives both the original gold band and the new diamond at the ceremony. The bride&#x27;s diamond ring is worn on top of the engagement band at the wedding and thereafter, especially at formal occasions or parties; otherwise the engagement band suffices for daily wear for both parties. At the wedding, the rings are swapped from the right to the left hand. In Brazil, they are always made of gold, and there is no tradition for the engagement ring. Both men and women wear the wedding band on their right hand while engaged, and, after they marry, they shift the rings to their left hands.

In the modern era, some women&#x27;s wedding rings are made into two separate pieces. One part is given to her to wear as an engagement ring when she accepts the marriage proposal and the other during the wedding ceremony. When worn together, the two rings look like one piece of jewelry. The engagement ring is not worn during the wedding ceremony, when the wedding ring is put by the groom on the finger of the bride, and sometimes by the bride onto the groom&#x27;s finger. After the wedding, the engagement ring is put back on, and is usually worn on the outside of the wedding ring.

==Engagement parties==
In contemporary American culture some engagements are announced at an engagement party, traditionally hosted by the bride&#x27;s parents. These parties help introduce both the bride and groom&#x27;s friends and family to each other in one place prior to the wedding. Often contemporary engagement parties are either cocktail parties or dinners with décor kept to a minimum. Gifts are not often given until either the wedding itself or a bridal shower.

In ancient Greece, engagement parties were held without the bride and took place to discuss the legal and economic aspects of the marriage. Later, engagement parties were when both sides announced a legal union prior to marriage where if one side broke the agreement they would have to pay the wronged side. Engagements became non-legally bending and by the early 20th century some couples would announce their engagement in the local paper.

<text>Manufacturing is the creation or production of goods with the help of equipment, labor, machines, tools, and chemical or biological processing or formulation. It is the essence of the secondary sector of the economy. The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high-tech, but it is most commonly applied to industrial design, in which raw materials from the primary sector are transformed into finished goods on a large scale. Such goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other more complex products (such as aircraft, household appliances, furniture, sports equipment or automobiles), or distributed via the tertiary industry to end users and consumers (usually through wholesalers, who in turn sell to retailers, who then sell them to individual customers).

Manufacturing engineering is the field of engineering that designs and optimizes the manufacturing process, or the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product. The manufacturing process begins with product design, and materials specification. These materials are then modified through manufacturing to become the desired product.

Contemporary manufacturing encompasses all intermediary stages involved in producing and integrating components of a product. Some industries, such as semiconductor and steel manufacturers, use the term fabrication instead.

The manufacturing sector is closely connected with the engineering and industrial design industries.

==Etymology==
The Modern English word &quot;manufacture&quot; is likely derived from the Middle French &quot;&quot; (&quot;process of making&quot;) which itself originates from the Classical Latin &quot;&quot; (&quot;hand&quot;) and Middle French &quot;&quot; (&quot;making&quot;). Alternatively, the English word may have been independently formed from the earlier English &quot;manufacture&quot; (&quot;made by human hands&quot;) and &quot;fracture&quot;. Its earliest usage in the English language was recorded in the mid-16th century to refer to the making of products by hand.

==History and development==
===Prehistory and ancient history===

Human ancestors manufactured objects using stone and other tools long before the emergence of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; about 200,000 years ago. The earliest methods of stone tool making, known as the Oldowan &quot;industry&quot;, date back to at least 2.3 million years ago, with the earliest direct evidence of tool usage found in Ethiopia within the Great Rift Valley, dating back to 2.5 million years ago. To manufacture a stone tool, a &quot;core&quot; of hard stone with specific flaking properties (such as flint) was struck with a hammerstone. This flaking produced sharp edges that could be used as tools, primarily in the form of choppers or scrapers. These tools greatly aided the early humans in their hunter-gatherer lifestyle to form other tools out of softer materials such as bone and wood. The Middle Paleolithic, approximately 300,000 years ago, saw the introduction of the prepared-core technique, where multiple blades could be rapidly formed from a single core stone. Pressure flaking, in which a wood, bone, or antler punch could be used to shape a stone very finely was developed during the Upper Paleolithic, beginning approximately 40,000 years ago. During the Neolithic period, polished stone tools were manufactured from a variety of hard rocks such as flint, jade, jadeite, and greenstone. The polished axes were used alongside other stone tools including projectiles, knives, and scrapers, as well as tools manufactured from organic materials such as wood, bone, and antler.

Copper smelting is believed to have originated when the technology of pottery kiln allowed sufficiently high temperatures. The concentration of various elements such as arsenic increase with depth in copper ore deposits and smelting of these ores yields arsenical bronze, which can be sufficiently work-hardened to be suitable for manufacturing tools. Bronze is an alloy of copper with tin; the latter of which being found in relatively few deposits globally delayed true tin bronze becoming widespread. During the Bronze Age, bronze was a major improvement over stone as a material for making tools, both because of its mechanical properties like strength and ductility and because it could be cast in molds to make intricately shaped objects. Bronze significantly advanced shipbuilding technology with better tools and bronze nails, which replaced the old method of attaching boards of the hull with cord woven through drilled holes. The Iron Age is conventionally defined by the widespread manufacturing of weapons and tools using iron and steel rather than bronze. Iron smelting is more difficult than tin and copper smelting because smelted iron requires hot-working and can be melted only in specially designed furnaces. The place and time for the discovery of iron smelting is not known, partly because of the difficulty of distinguishing metal extracted from nickel-containing ores from hot-worked meteoritic iron.

During the growth of the ancient civilizations, many ancient technologies resulted from advances in manufacturing. Several of the six classic simple machines were invented in Mesopotamia. Mesopotamians have been credited with the invention of the wheel. The wheel and axle mechanism first appeared with the potter&#x27;s wheel, invented in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC. Egyptian paper made from papyrus, as well as pottery, were mass-produced and exported throughout the Mediterranean basin. Early construction techniques used by the Ancient Egyptians made use of bricks composed mainly of clay, sand, silt, and other minerals.

===Medieval and early modern===

The Middle Ages witnessed new inventions, innovations in the ways of managing traditional means of production, and economic growth. Papermaking, a 2nd-century Chinese technology, was carried to the Middle East when a group of Chinese papermakers were captured in the 8th century. Papermaking technology was spread to Europe by the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. A paper mill was established in Sicily in the 12th century. In Europe the fiber to make pulp for making paper was obtained from linen and cotton rags. Lynn Townsend White Jr. credited the spinning wheel with increasing the supply of rags, which led to cheap paper, which was a factor in the development of printing. Due to the casting of cannon, the blast furnace came into widespread use in France in the mid 15th century. The blast furnace had been used in China since the 4th century BC. The stocking frame, which was invented in 1598, increased a knitter&#x27;s number of knots per minute from 100 to 1000.

===First and Second Industrial Revolutions===
The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in Europe and the United States from 1760 to the 1830s. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, the increasing use of steam power and water power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the mechanized factory system. The Industrial Revolution also led to an unprecedented rise in the rate of population growth. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested. The textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods. Rapid industrialization first began in Britain, starting with mechanized spinning in the 1780s, with high rates of growth in steam power and iron production occurring after 1800. Mechanized textile production spread from Great Britain to continental Europe and the United States in the early 19th century, with important centres of textiles, iron and coal emerging in Belgium and the United States and later textiles in France.

An economic recession occurred from the late 1830s to the early 1840s when the adoption of the Industrial Revolution&#x27;s early innovations, such as mechanized spinning and weaving, slowed down and their markets matured. Innovations developed late in the period, such as the increasing adoption of locomotives, steamboats and steamships, hot blast iron smelting and new technologies, such as the electrical telegraph, were widely introduced in the 1840s and 1850s, were not powerful enough to drive high rates of growth. Rapid economic growth began to occur after 1870, springing from a new group of innovations in what has been called the Second Industrial Revolution. These innovations included new steel making processes, mass-production, assembly lines, electrical grid systems, the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the use of increasingly advanced machinery in steam-powered factories.

Building on improvements in vacuum pumps and materials research, incandescent light bulbs became practical for general use in the late 1870s. This invention had a profound effect on the workplace because factories could now have second and third shift workers. Shoe production was mechanized during the mid 19th century. Mass production of sewing machines and agricultural machinery such as reapers occurred in the mid to late 19th century. The mass production of bicycles started in the 1880s. Steam-powered factories became widespread, although the conversion from water power to steam occurred in England earlier than in the U.S.

===Modern manufacturing===

Electrification of factories, which had begun gradually in the 1890s after the introduction of the practical DC motor and the AC motor, was fastest between 1900 and 1930. This was aided by the establishment of electric utilities with central stations and the lowering of electricity prices from 1914 to 1917. Electric motors allowed more flexibility in manufacturing and required less maintenance than line shafts and belts. Many factories witnessed a 30% increase in output owing to the increasing shift to electric motors. Electrification enabled modern mass production, and the biggest impact of early mass production was in the manufacturing of everyday items, such as at the Ball Brothers Glass Manufacturing Company, which electrified its mason jar plant in Muncie, Indiana, U.S. around 1900. The new automated process used glass blowing machines to replace 210 craftsman glass blowers and helpers. A small electric truck was now used to handle 150 dozen bottles at a time whereas previously used hand trucks could only carry 6 dozen bottles at a time. Electric mixers replaced men with shovels handling sand and other ingredients that were fed into the glass furnace. An electric overhead crane replaced 36 day laborers for moving heavy loads across the factory.

Mass production was popularized in the late 1910s and 1920s by Henry Ford&#x27;s Ford Motor Company, which introduced electric motors to the then-well-known technique of chain or sequential production. Ford also bought or designed and built special purpose machine tools and fixtures such as multiple spindle drill presses that could drill every hole on one side of an engine block in one operation and a multiple head milling machine that could simultaneously machine 15 engine blocks held on a single fixture. All of these machine tools were arranged systematically in the production flow and some had special carriages for rolling heavy items into machining positions. Production of the Ford Model T used 32,000 machine tools.

Lean manufacturing, also known as just-in-time manufacturing, was developed in Japan in the 1930s. It is a production method aimed primarily at reducing times within the production system as well as response times from suppliers and to customers. It was introduced in Australia in the 1950s by the British Motor Corporation (Australia) at its Victoria Park plant in Sydney, from where the idea later migrated to Toyota. News spread to western countries from Japan in 1977 in two English-language articles: one referred to the methodology as the &quot;Ohno system&quot;, after Taiichi Ohno, who was instrumental in its development within Toyota. The other article, by Toyota authors in an international journal, provided additional details. Finally, those and other publicity were translated into implementations, beginning in 1980 and then quickly multiplying throughout the industry in the United States and other countries.

==Manufacturing strategy==
According to a &quot;traditional&quot; view of manufacturing strategy, there are five key dimensions along which the performance of manufacturing can be assessed: cost, quality, dependability, flexibility and innovation.

In regard to manufacturing performance, Wickham Skinner, who has been called &quot;the father of manufacturing strategy&quot;, adopted the concept of &quot;focus&quot;, with an implication that a business cannot perform at the highest level along all five dimensions and must therefore select one or two competitive priorities. This view led to the theory of &quot;trade offs&quot; in manufacturing strategy. Similarly, Elizabeth Haas wrote in 1987 about the delivery of value in manufacturing for customers in terms of &quot;lower prices, greater service responsiveness or higher quality&quot;. The theory of &quot;trade offs&quot; has subsequently being debated and questioned, but Skinner wrote in 1992 that at that time &quot;enthusiasm for the concepts of &#x27;manufacturing strategy&#x27; [had] been higher&quot;, noting that in academic papers, executive courses and case studies, levels of interest were &quot;bursting out all over&quot;.

Manufacturing writer Terry Hill has commented that manufacturing is often seen as a less &quot;strategic&quot; business activity than functions such as marketing and finance, and that manufacturing managers have &quot;come late&quot; to business strategy-making discussions, where, as a result, they make only a reactive contribution.

==Industrial policy==
===Economics of manufacturing===
Emerging technologies have offered new growth methods in advanced manufacturing employment opportunities, for example in the Manufacturing Belt in the United States. Manufacturing provides important material support for national infrastructure and also for national defense.

On the other hand, most manufacturing processes may involve significant social and environmental costs. The clean-up costs of hazardous waste, for example, may outweigh the benefits of a product that creates it. Hazardous materials may expose workers to health risks. These costs are now well known and there is effort to address them by improving efficiency, reducing waste, using industrial symbiosis, and eliminating harmful chemicals.

The negative costs of manufacturing can also be addressed legally. Developed countries regulate manufacturing activity with labor laws and environmental laws. Across the globe, manufacturers can be subject to regulations and pollution taxes to offset the environmental costs of manufacturing activities. Labor unions and craft guilds have played a historic role in the negotiation of worker rights and wages. Environment laws and labor protections that are available in developed nations may not be available in the third world. Tort law and product liability impose additional costs on manufacturing. These are significant dynamics in the ongoing process, occurring over the last few decades, of manufacture-based industries relocating operations to &quot;developing-world&quot; economies where the costs of production are significantly lower than in &quot;developed-world&quot; economies.

=== Finance ===
From a financial perspective, the goal of the manufacturing industry is mainly to achieve cost benefits per unit produced, which in turn leads to cost reductions in product prices for the market towards end customers. This relative cost reduction towards the market, is how manufacturing firms secure their profit margins.

=== Safety ===
Manufacturing has unique health and safety challenges and has been recognized by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues.

===Manufacturing and investment===

Surveys and analyses of trends and issues in manufacturing and investment around the world focus on such things as:
* The nature and sources of the considerable variations that occur cross-nationally in levels of manufacturing and wider industrial-economic growth;
* Competitiveness; and
* Attractiveness to foreign direct investors.

In addition to general overviews, researchers have examined the features and factors affecting particular key aspects of manufacturing development. They have compared production and investment in a range of Western and non-Western countries and presented case studies of growth and performance in important individual industries and market-economic sectors.

On June 26, 2009, Jeff Immelt, the CEO of General Electric, called for the United States to increase its manufacturing base employment to 20% of the workforce, commenting that the U.S. has outsourced too much in some areas and can no longer rely on the financial sector and consumer spending to drive demand. Further, while U.S. manufacturing performs well compared to the rest of the U.S. economy, research shows that it performs poorly compared to manufacturing in other high-wage countries. A total of 3.2 million – one in six U.S. manufacturing jobs – have disappeared between 2000 and 2007. In the UK, EEF the manufacturers organisation has led calls for the UK economy to be rebalanced to rely less on financial services and has actively promoted the manufacturing agenda.

==Major manufacturing nations==

According to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), China is the manufacturer with the highest output worldwide in 2023, producing 28.7% of the total global manufacturing output, followed by the United States of America, Germany, Japan, and India.

UNIDO also publishes a Competitive Industrial Performance (CIP) Index, which measures the competitive manufacturing ability of different nations. The CIP Index combines a nation&#x27;s gross manufacturing output with other factors like high-tech capability and the nation&#x27;s impact on the world economy. Germany topped the 2020 CIP Index, followed by China, South Korea, the United States, and Japan.

In 2023, the manufacturing industry in the United States accounted for 10.70% of the total national output, employing 8.41% of the workforce. The total value of manufacturing output reached $2.5 trillion. In 2023, Germany&#x27;s manufacturing output reached $844.93 billion, marking a 12.25% increase from 2022. The sector employed approximately 5.5 million people, accounting for around 20.8% of the workforce.

<text>A pine is any conifer tree or shrub in the genus Pinus () of the family Pinaceae. &quot;Pinus&quot; is the sole genus in the subfamily Pinoideae.

&quot;World Flora Online&quot; accepts 134 species-rank taxa (119 species and 15 nothospecies) of pines as current, with additional synonyms, and &quot;Plants of the World Online&quot; 126 species-rank taxa (113 species and 13 nothospecies), making it the largest genus among the conifers. The highest species diversity of pines is found in Mexico. Pines are widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere; they occupy large areas of boreal forest, but are found in many habitats, including the Mediterranean Basin, and dry tropical forests in southeast Asia and Central America.

Wood from pine trees is one of the most extensively used types of timber, and some pines are widely used as Christmas trees.

== Description ==

Pine trees are evergreen, coniferous resinous trees (or, rarely, shrubs) growing tall, with the majority of species reaching tall. The smallest are Siberian dwarf pine and Potosi pinyon, and the tallest is an tall sugar pine located in Yosemite National Park.

Pines are long lived and typically reach ages of 100–1,000 years, some even more. The longest-lived is the Great Basin bristlecone pine (&quot;P. longaeva&quot;). One individual of this species, dubbed &quot;Methuselah&quot;, is one of the world&#x27;s oldest living organisms at around 4,800-years old. This tree can be found in the White Mountains of California. An older tree, now cut down, was dated at 4,900-years old. It was discovered in a grove beneath Wheeler Peak and it is now known as &quot;Prometheus&quot; after the Greek immortal.

The spiral growth of branches, needles, and cones scales are arranged in Fibonacci number ratios.

=== Bark ===

The bark of most pines is thick and scaly, but some species have thin, flaky bark. The branches are produced in &quot;pseudo-whorls&quot;, actually a very tight spiral but appearing like a ring of branches arising from the same point. Many pines are uninodal, producing just one such whorl of branches each year, from buds at the tip of the year&#x27;s new shoot, but others are multinodal, producing two or more whorls of branches per year.

=== Foliage ===

Pines have four types of leaf:

* Seed leaves (cotyledons) on seedlings are borne in a whorl of 4–24.
* Juvenile leaves, which follow immediately on seedlings and young plants, are long, single, green or often blue-green, and arranged spirally on the shoot. These are produced for six months to five years, rarely longer.
* Scale leaves, similar to bud scales, are small, brown and not photosynthetic, and arranged spirally like the juvenile leaves.
* Needles, the adult leaves, are green (photosynthetic) and bundled in clusters called fascicles. The needles can number from one to seven per fascicle, but generally number from two to five. Each fascicle is produced from a small bud on a dwarf shoot in the axil of a scale leaf. These bud scales often remain on the fascicle as a basal sheath. The needles persist for 1.5–40 years, depending on species. If a shoot&#x27;s growing tip is damaged (e.g. eaten by an animal), the needle fascicles just below the damage will generate a stem-producing bud, which can then replace the lost growth tip.

=== Cones ===

Pines are monoecious, having the male and female cones on the same tree. The male cones are small, typically 1–5 cm long, and only present for a short period (usually in spring, though autumn in a few pines), falling as soon as they have shed their pollen. The female cones take 1.5–3 years (depending on species) to mature after pollination, with actual fertilisation delayed one year. At maturity the female cones are 3–60 cm long. Each cone has numerous spirally arranged scales, with two seeds on each fertile scale; the scales at the base and tip of the cone are small and sterile, without seeds.

The seeds are mostly small and winged, and are anemochorous (wind-dispersed), but some are larger and have only a vestigial wing, and are bird-dispersed. Female cones are woody and sometimes armed to protect developing seeds from foragers. At maturity, the cones usually open to release the seeds. In some of the bird-dispersed species, for example whitebark pine, the seeds are only released by the bird breaking the cones open. In others, the seeds are stored in closed cones for many years until an environmental cue triggers the cones to open, releasing the seeds. This is called serotiny. The most common form of serotiny is pyriscence, in which resin binds the cones shut until melted by a forest fire, for example in &quot;P. radiata&quot; and &quot;P. muricata&quot;; the seeds are then released after the fire to colonise the burnt ground with minimal competition from other plants.

== Naming ==

=== Etymology ===

The modern English name &quot;pine&quot; derives from Latin &quot;pinus&quot;, traced to the Indo-European base &quot;*pīt-&quot; &#x27;resin&#x27;. Before the 19th century, pines were often called firs, a name now applied to another genus, &quot;Abies&quot;. In some European languages, Germanic cognates of the Old Norse name are still in use for pines, as in Danish &quot;fyr&quot;, Swedish &quot;fura/furu&quot;, and German &quot;Föhre&quot;.

=== Taxonomic history ===

The genus &quot;Pinus&quot; was named by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. &quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;, the Scots pine, was later chosen as the type species.

== Evolution ==

=== Taxonomy ===

Pines are gymnosperms. The genus is divided into two subgenera based on the number of fibrovascular bundles in the needle, and the presence or absence of a resin seal on the scales of the mature cones before opening. The subgenera can be distinguished by cone, seed, and leaf characters:
*&quot;Pinus&quot; subg. &quot;Pinus&quot;, the yellow, or hard pine group, with cones with a resin seal on the scales, and generally with harder wood; the needle fascicles mostly have a persistent sheath (two exceptions, &quot;Pinus leiophylla&quot; and &quot;Pinus lumholtzii&quot;, have deciduous sheaths). The subgenus has also been called &quot;diploxylon&quot;, on account of its two fibrovascular bundles.
*&quot;Pinus&quot; subg. &quot;Strobus&quot;, syn. &quot;Pinus&quot; subg. &quot;Ducampopinus&quot;, the white, or soft pine, and pinyon pine groups, with cones without a resin seal on the scales, and usually have softer wood; the needle fascicles mostly have a deciduous sheath (one exception, &quot;Pinus nelsonii&quot;, has a persistent sheath). The subgenus has also been called &quot;haploxylon&quot;, on account of its single fibrovascular bundle.

Phylogenetic evidence indicates that both subgenera have a very ancient divergence from one another. Each subgenus is further divided into sections and subsections.

Many of the smaller groups of &quot;Pinus&quot; are composed of closely related species with recent divergence and history of hybridisation. This results in low morphological and genetic differences. This, coupled with low sampling and underdeveloped genetic techniques, has made taxonomy difficult to determine. Recent research using large genetic datasets has clarified these relationships into the groupings often accepted today.

=== Phylogeny ===

&quot;Pinus&quot; is the largest genus of the Pinaceae, the pine family, which first appeared in the Jurassic period. Based on recent transcriptome analysis, &quot;Pinus&quot; is most closely related to the genus &quot;Cathaya&quot;, which in turn is closely related to the genus &quot;Picea&quot;, the spruces. These genera, with firs and larches, form the pinoid clade of the Pinaceae. Pines first appeared during the Early Cretaceous, with the oldest verified fossil of the genus being &quot;Pinus yorkshirensis&quot; from the Hauterivian-Barremian boundary (~130-125 million years ago) from the Speeton Clay, England. However, there are possible records from the Jurassic.

The evolutionary history of the genus &quot;Pinus&quot; has been complicated by hybridisation. Pines are prone to inter-specific breeding. Wind pollination, long life spans, overlapping generations, large population size, and weak reproductive isolation make breeding across species more likely. As the pines have diversified, gene transfer between different species has created a complex history of genetic relatedness.

Two recent phylogenies are given below; the differences between them, and other published phylogenies, demonstrate these complications:
== Distribution and habitat ==

Pines are native to the Northern Hemisphere, and to a few parts from the tropics to temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere. Most regions of the Northern Hemisphere host some native species of pines; they occupy large areas of Boreal forest, and are found all around the Mediterranean Basin. The northernmost is Scots pine, reaching just north of 70° N in Stabbursdalen National Park in Norway; Google Maps shows geolocated images with pines at 70° 09&#x27; N. One species (Sumatran pine) crosses the equator in Sumatra to 2°S. In North America, various species occur in regions at latitudes from as far north as 66° N to as far south as 12°N.

Pines may be found in a very large variety of environments, ranging from semi-arid desert to rainforests, from sea level up to , from the coldest to the hottest environments on Earth. They often occur in mountainous areas with favourable soils and at least some water.

Various species have been introduced to temperate and subtropical regions of both hemispheres, where they are grown as timber or cultivated as ornamental plants in parks and gardens. A number of such introduced species have become naturalised, and some species are considered invasive in some areas and threaten native ecosystems.

== Ecology ==

Pines grow well in acid soils, some also on calcareous soils; most require good soil drainage, preferring sandy soils, but a few (e.g. lodgepole pine) can tolerate poorly drained wet soils. A few are able to sprout after forest fires (e.g. Canary Island pine). Some species of pines (e.g. Bishop pine) need fire to regenerate, and their populations slowly decline under fire suppression regimens.

Pine trees are beneficial to the environment since they can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Although several studies have indicated that after the establishment of pine plantations in grasslands, there is an alteration of carbon pools including a decrease of the soil organic carbon pool.

Several species are adapted to extreme conditions imposed by elevation and latitude (e.g. Siberian dwarf pine, mountain pine, whitebark pine, and the bristlecone pines). The pinyon pines and a number of others, notably Turkish pine and gray pine, are particularly well adapted to growth in hot, dry semidesert climates.

Pine pollen may play an important role in the functioning of detrital food webs. Nutrients from pollen aid detritivores in development, growth, and maturation, and may enable fungi to decompose nutritionally scarce litter. Pine pollen is also involved in moving plant matter between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

=== Wildlife ===
Pine needles serve as food for various Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species. Several species of pine are attacked by nematodes, causing pine wilt disease, which can kill some quickly. Some of these Lepidoptera species, many of them moths, specialise in feeding on only one or sometimes several species of pine. Beside that many species of birds and mammals shelter in pine habitat or feed on pine nuts. The seeds are commonly eaten by birds, such as grouse, crossbills, jays, nuthatches, siskins, and woodpeckers, and by squirrels. Some birds, notably nutcrackers and pinyon jays, are of major importance in distributing pine seeds to new areas. Pine needles are sometimes eaten by the Symphytan species pine sawfly, and goats.

== Uses ==

=== Timber and construction ===

Pines are among the most commercially important tree species, valued for their timber and wood pulp throughout the world. 
In temperate and tropical regions, they are fast-growing softwoods that grow in relatively dense stands. Commercial pines are grown in plantations for timber that is denser and therefore more durable than spruce (&quot;Picea&quot;). Pine wood is widely used in high-value carpentry items such as furniture, window frames, panelling, floors, and roofing.
Turpentine is extracted from the wood of some species of pine.

As pine wood has no insect- or decay-resistant qualities after logging, in its untreated state it is generally recommended for indoor construction purposes only (indoor drywall framing, for example). It is commonly used in Canadian Lumber Standard graded wood. For outside use, pine needs to be treated with copper azole, chromated copper arsenate or other suitable chemical preservative.

===Ornamental uses===

Many pine species make attractive ornamental plantings for parks and larger gardens with a variety of dwarf cultivars being suitable for smaller spaces. There are currently 818 named cultivars (or trinomials) recognised by the American Conifer Society ACS. Pines are also commercially grown and harvested for Christmas trees. Pine cones, among the largest and most durable of all conifer cones, are craft favourites. Pine boughs, appreciated especially in wintertime for their pleasant smell and greenery, are popularly cut for decorations. Pine needles are also used for making decorative articles such as baskets, trays, pots, etc., and during the U.S. Civil War, the needles of the longleaf pine &quot;Georgia pine&quot; were widely employed in this. This originally Native American skill is now being replicated across the world. Pine needle handicrafts are made in the US, Canada, Mexico, Nicaragua, and India. Pine needles are also versatile and have been used by Latvian designer Tamara Orjola to create different biodegradable products including paper, furniture, textiles and dye.

===Forestry===

When grown for sawlogs, pine plantations can be harvested after 25 years, with some stands being allowed to grow up to 50 or more years (the wood value increases more quickly as the trees age). In colder and drier climates, growth is slower, and harvesting can be at much older ages. Imperfect trees (such as those with bent trunks or forks, smaller trees, or diseased trees) are removed in a &quot;thinning&quot; operation every 5–10 years. Thinning allows the best trees to grow faster, because it prevents weaker trees from competing for sunlight, water, and nutrients. Young trees removed during thinning are used for pulpwood or are left in the forest, while most older ones are good enough for saw timber.

A 30-year-old commercial pine tree grown in good conditions in Arkansas will be about in diameter and about high. After 50 years, the same tree will be about in diameter and high, and its wood will be worth about seven times as much as the 30-year-old tree.
This however depends on the region, species and silvicultural techniques. In New Zealand, a plantation&#x27;s maximum value is reached after around 28 years with height being as high as and diameter , with maximum wood production after around 35 years (again depending on factors such as site, stocking and genetics). Trees are normally planted 3–4 m apart, or about 1,000 per hectare (100,000 per square kilometre).

===Food and nutrients===

The seeds (pine nuts) are generally edible; the young male cones can be cooked and eaten, as can the bark of young twigs. Some species have large pine nuts, which are harvested and sold for cooking and baking. They are an ingredient of &quot;pesto alla genovese&quot;.

The soft, moist, white inner bark (cambium) beneath the woody outer bark is edible and very high in vitamins A and C. It can be eaten raw in slices as a snack or dried and ground up into a powder for use as an ersatz flour or thickener in stews, soups, and other foods, such as bark bread. Adirondack Indians got their name from the Mohawk Indian word &quot;atirú:taks&quot;, meaning &quot;tree eaters&quot;.

A tea is made by steeping young, green pine needles in boiling water (known as &quot;tallstrunt&quot; in Sweden). In eastern Asia, pine and other conifers are accepted among consumers as a beverage product, and used in teas, as well as wine. In Greece, the wine retsina is flavoured with Aleppo pine resin.

Pine needles from &quot;Pinus densiflora&quot; were found to contain 30.54 milligram/gram of proanthocyanidins when extracted with hot water.

In traditional Chinese medicine, pine resin is used for burns, wounds and skin complaints.

==Culture==

Pines have been a frequently mentioned tree throughout history, including in literature, art, and in religious texts.

The pine is a particular motif in Chinese art and literature, which sometimes combines painting and poetry in the same work. Some of the main symbolic attributes of pines in Chinese art and literature are longevity and steadfastness: the pine retains its green needles through all the seasons. Sometimes the pine and cypress are paired. At other times the pine, plum, and bamboo are considered as the &quot;Three Friends of Winter&quot;.

===Literature===

Writers of various nationalities and ethnicities have written of pines. Among them, John Muir, Dora Sigerson Shorter, Eugene Field, Bai Juyi, Theodore Winthrop, and Rev. George Allan D.D.

===Art===

Pines are often featured in art, whether painting and fine art, drawing, photography, or folk art.

===Religious texts===

Trees which may be pines or other conifers are mentioned in some verses of the Bible. In the Book of Nehemiah 8:15, the King James Version translates Hebrew &quot;עץ שמן&quot; (etz shman), &#x27;oil tree&#x27;, as pine, and the unknown type of tree of Hebrew &quot;תדהר&quot; in Isaiah 60:13 similarly. Some botanical authorities believe that the Hebrew word &quot;ברוש&quot; (bərōsh), &quot;cypress&quot;, which is used many times in the Bible, properly designates &quot;Pinus halepensis&quot;, the Aleppo or Jerusalem pine, or in Hosea 14:8 which refers to fruit, &quot;Pinus pinea&quot;, the stone pine.
The word used in modern Hebrew for pine is &quot;אֹ֖רֶן&quot; (oren), which occurs only in Isaiah 44:14, but two manuscripts have &quot;ארז&quot; (cedar), a much more common word.

<doc id="39393" wikidata="Q179541" url="?curid=39393" title="Epicureanism">
<text>Epicureanism is a system of philosophy founded 307 BCE based upon the teachings of Epicurus, an ancient Greek philosopher. Epicurus was an atomist and materialist, following in the steps of Democritus. His materialism led him to religious skepticism and a general attack on superstition and divine intervention. Epicureanism was originally a challenge to Platonism, and its main opponent later became Stoicism. It is a form of hedonism insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal. However, the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure, and its advocacy of a simple life, make it very different from hedonism as colloquially understood.

Following the Cyrenaic philosopher Aristippus, Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable pleasure in the form of a state of &quot;ataraxia&quot; (tranquility and freedom from fear) and &quot;aponia&quot; (the absence of bodily pain) through knowledge of the workings of the world and limiting desires. Correspondingly, Epicurus and his followers generally withdrew from politics because it could lead to frustrations and ambitions that would conflict with their pursuit of virtue and peace of mind.

Few writings by Epicurus have survived. Diogenes Laërtius preserves three letters written by Epicurus, as well as a list of the Principal Doctrines of Epicureanism; however, there are independent attestations of his ideas from his later disciples. The epic poem &quot;De rerum natura&quot; (Latin for &quot;On the Nature of Things&quot;) by Lucretius presents the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism in one unified work. Many Epicurean texts have also been found on scrolls unearthed at the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum, mostly works written by the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus or his teacher Zeno of Sidon along with fragments of works by Epicurus himself. Diogenes of Oenoanda, a wealthy Epicurean in the 2nd century CE, had a portico wall inscribed with tenets of the philosophy erected in Oenoanda, Lycia (present day Turkey).

Epicureanism flourished in the Late Hellenistic period and during the Roman era, and many Epicurean communities were established in places such as Antioch, Alexandria, Rhodes, and Herculaneum. By the late 3rd century CE, Epicureanism all but died out, being opposed by other philosophies (mainly Neoplatonism) that were then in the ascent. Interest in Epicureanism was resurrected in the Age of Enlightenment and continues in the modern era.

==History==
Epicurus taught and gained followers in Mytilene, the capital of the island Lesbos, and then in Lampsacus. In Athens, Epicurus bought a property for his school called &quot;Garden&quot;, which later became the name of Epicurus&#x27; school. Its members included Hermarchus, Idomeneus, Colotes, Polyaenus, and Metrodorus. Epicurus emphasized friendship as an important ingredient of happiness, and the school seems to have been a moderately ascetic community which rejected the political limelight of Athenian philosophy. They were fairly cosmopolitan by Athenian standards, including women and slaves. Community activities held some importance, particularly the observance of Eikas, a monthly social gathering. Some members were also vegetarians as, from slight evidence, Epicurus did not eat meat, although no prohibition against eating meat was made.

The school&#x27;s popularity grew and it became, along with Stoicism, Platonism, Peripateticism, and Pyrrhonism, one of the dominant schools of Hellenistic philosophy, lasting strongly through the later Roman Empire. Deciphered carbonized scrolls obtained from the library at the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum contain a large number of works by Philodemus, a late Hellenistic Epicurean, and Epicurus himself, attesting to the school&#x27;s enduring popularity. Julius Caesar also leaned considerably toward Epicureanism, which led to his plea against the death sentence during the trial against Catiline, during the Catiline conspiracy where he spoke out against the Stoic Cato. His father-in-law, Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, was also an adept of the school. In the 2nd century CE, comedian Lucian of Samosata and wealthy promoter of philosophy Diogenes of Oenoanda were prominent Epicureans.

By the late third century CE, however, there was little trace of its existence. 
With growing dominance of Neoplatonism and Peripateticism, and later, Christianity, Epicureanism declined.

==Philosophy==
===Physics===
In his letter to Herodotus, Epicurus presented three principles as to the nature of the physical world, i.e. that that which exists cannot come into being from that which does not exist, that which is destroyed does not cease to exist, and all that exists now always did exist and always will. The object of these principles was to establish the fact that all that constitutes the world is permanent and unchanging. Epicurean physics held that the entire universe consisted of two things: matter and void. Matter is made up of atoms, which are tiny bodies that have only the unchanging qualities of shape, size, and weight. The Epicureans believed that atoms were unchanging because the world was ordered and that changes had to have specific and consistent sources, e.g. a plant species only grows from a seed of the same species, but that in order for the universe to persist, what it is ultimately made up of must not be able to be changed or else the universe would be essentially destroyed.

Epicurus holds that there must be an infinite supply of atoms, although only a finite number of types of atoms, as well as an infinite amount of void. Epicurus explains this position in his letter to Herodotus:

Moreover, the sum of things is unlimited both by reason of the multitude of the atoms and the extent of the void. For if the void were infinite and bodies finite, the bodies would not have stayed anywhere but would have been dispersed in their course through the infinite void, not having any supports or counterchecks to send them back on their upward rebound. Again, if the void were finite, the infinity of bodies would not have anywhere to be. Because of the infinite supply of atoms, there are an infinite number of worlds, or &quot;cosmoi&quot;. Some of these worlds could be vastly different from our own, some quite similar, and all of the worlds were separated from each other by vast areas of void (&quot;metakosmia&quot;).

Epicureanism states that atoms are unable to be broken down into any smaller parts because void is necessary for matter to move. Anything which consists of both void and matter can be broken down, while if something contains no void then it has no way to break apart because no part of the substance could be broken down into a smaller subsection of the substance. Atoms are constantly moving in one of four different ways. Atoms can simply collide with each other and then bounce off of each other. When joined with each other and forming a larger object, atoms can vibrate as they collide into each other while still maintaining the overall shape of the larger object.

When not prevented by other atoms, all atoms move at the same speed naturally downwards in relation to the rest of the world. This downwards motion is natural for atoms; however, as their fourth means of motion, atoms can at times randomly swerve out of their usual downwards path. This swerving motion is what allowed for the creation of the universe, since as more and more atoms swerved and collided with each other, objects were able to take shape as the atoms joined together. Without the swerve, the atoms would never have interacted with each other, and simply continued to move downwards at the same speed. Epicurus also felt that the swerve was what accounted for humanity&#x27;s free will. If it were not for the swerve, humans would be subject to a never-ending chain of cause and effect. This was a point which Epicureans often used to criticize Democritus&#x27; atomic theory.

===Epistemology===
Epicurean philosophy employs an empirical epistemology, one based on the senses.

====Sense perception====
Epicureans believed that senses also relied on atoms. Every object was continually emitting particles from itself that would then interact with the observer. All sensations, such as sight, smell, or sound, relied on these particles. While the atoms that were emitted did not have the qualities that the senses were perceiving, the manner in which they were emitted caused the observer to experience those sensations, e.g. red particles were not themselves red but were emitted in a manner that caused the viewer to experience the color red. The atoms are not perceived individually, but rather as a continuous sensation because of how quickly they move.

The Epicureans believed that all sense perceptions were true, and that errors arise in how we judge those perceptions. When we form judgments about things (&quot;hupolepsis&quot;), they can be verified and corrected through further sensory information. For example, if someone sees a tower from far away that appears to be round, and upon approaching the tower they see that it is actually square, they would come to realize that their original judgement was wrong and correct their wrong opinion.

====Criterion of truth====
Epicurus is said to have proposed three criteria of truth: sensations (&quot;aisthêsis&quot;), preconceptions (&quot;prolepsis&quot;), and feelings (&quot;pathê&quot;). A fourth criterion called &quot;presentational applications of the mind&quot; (&quot;phantastikai epibolai tês dianoias&quot;) was said to have been added by later Epicureans. These criteria formed the method through which Epicureans thought we gained knowledge.

Since Epicureans thought that sensations could not deceive, sensations are the first and main criterion of truth for Epicureans. Even in cases where sensory input seems to mislead, the input itself is true and the error arises from our judgments about the input. For example, when one places a straight oar in the water, it appears bent. The Epicurean would argue that the image of the oar, that is, the atoms traveling from the oar to the observer&#x27;s eyes, has been shifted and thus really does arrive at the observer&#x27;s eyes in the shape of a bent oar. The observer makes the error in assuming that the image he or she receives correctly represents the oar and has not been distorted in some way. In order to not make erroneous judgments about perceivable things and instead verify one&#x27;s judgment, Epicureans believed that one needed to obtain &quot;clear vision&quot; (&quot;enargeia&quot;) of the perceivable thing by closer examination. This acted as a justification for one&#x27;s judgements about the thing being perceived. &quot;Enargeia&quot; is characterized as sensation of an object that has been unchanged by judgments or opinions and is a clear and direct perception of that object.

An individual&#x27;s preconceptions are his or her concepts of what things are, e.g. what someone&#x27;s idea of a horse is, and these concepts are formed in a person&#x27;s mind through sensory input over time. When the word that relates to the preconception is used, these preconceptions are summoned up by the mind into the person&#x27;s thoughts. It is through our preconceptions that we are able to make judgments about the things that we perceive. Preconceptions were also used by Epicureans to avoid the paradox proposed by Plato in the &quot;Meno&quot; regarding learning. Plato argues that learning requires us to already have knowledge of what we are learning, or else we would be unable to recognize when we had successfully learned the information. Preconceptions, Epicureans argue, provide individuals with that pre-knowledge required for learning.

Our feelings or emotions (&quot;pathê&quot;) are how we perceive pleasure and pain. They are analogous to sensations in that they are a means of perception, but they perceive our internal state as opposed to external things. According to Diogenes Laertius, feelings are how we determine our actions. If something is pleasurable, we pursue that thing, and if something is painful, we avoid that thing.

The idea of &quot;presentational applications of the mind&quot; is an explanation for how we can discuss and inquire about things we cannot directly perceive. We receive impressions of such things directly in our minds, instead of perceiving them through other senses. The concept of &quot;presentational applications of the mind&quot; may have been introduced to explain how we learn about things that we cannot directly perceive, such as the gods.

===Ethics===

Epicureanism bases its ethics on a hedonistic set of values, seeing pleasure as the chief good in life. Hence, Epicurus advocated living in such a way as to derive the greatest amount of pleasure possible during one&#x27;s lifetime, yet doing so moderately in order to avoid the suffering incurred by overindulgence in such pleasure. Epicurus actively recommended against passionate love, and believed it best to avoid marriage altogether. He viewed recreational sex as a natural, but not necessary, desire that should be generally avoided. Since the political life could give rise to desires that could disturb virtue and one&#x27;s peace of mind, such as a lust for power or a desire for fame, participation in politics was discouraged. Further, Epicurus sought to eliminate the fear of the gods and of death, seeing those two fears as chief causes of strife in life.

====Pleasure====

Epicureans had a very specific understanding of what the greatest pleasure was, and the focus of their ethics was on the avoidance of pain rather than seeking out pleasure. As evidence for this, Epicureans say that nature seems to command us to avoid pain, and they point out that all animals try to avoid pain as much as possible. Epicureanism divided pleasure into two broad categories: &quot;pleasures of the body&quot; and &quot;pleasures of the mind&quot;. &quot;Pleasures of the body&quot; involve sensations of the body, such as the act of eating delicious food or of being in a state of comfort free from pain, and exist only in the present. One can only experience pleasures of the body in the moment, meaning they only exist as a person is experiencing them. &quot;Pleasures of the mind&quot; involve mental processes and states; feelings of joy, the lack of fear, and pleasant memories are all examples of pleasures of the mind. These pleasures of the mind do not only exist in the present, but also in the past and future, since memory of a past pleasant experience or the expectation of some potentially pleasing future can both be pleasurable experiences. Because of this, the pleasures of the mind are considered to be greater than those of the body.

Emphasis was placed on pleasures of the mind rather than on physical pleasures. The Epicureans further divided each of these types of pleasures into two categories: &quot;kinetic pleasure&quot; and &quot;katastematic pleasure&quot;. Absence of pain, aponia, and lack of disturbance of mind, ataraxia, are two of the katastematic pleasures and often seen as the focal ones to Epicurus. &quot;Kinetic pleasure&quot; is the physical or mental pleasures that involve action or change. Eating delicious food, as well as fulfilling desires and removing pain, which is itself considered a pleasurable act, are all examples of kinetic pleasure in the physical sense. According to Epicurus, feelings of joy would be an example of mental kinetic pleasure. &quot;Katastematic pleasure&quot; is the pleasure one feels while in a state without pain. Like kinetic pleasures, katastematic pleasures can also be physical, such as the state of not being thirsty, or mental, such as freedom from a state of fear. Complete physical katastematic pleasure is called &quot;aponia&quot;, and complete mental katastematic pleasure is called &quot;ataraxia&quot;.

While the pursuit of pleasure formed the focal point of the philosophy, this was largely directed to the &quot;static pleasures&quot; of minimizing pain, anxiety and suffering. From this understanding, Epicureans concluded that the greatest pleasure a person could reach was the complete removal of all pain, both physical and mental. The ultimate goal then of Epicurean ethics was to reach a state of &quot;aponia&quot; and &quot;ataraxia&quot;.

====Desire====

In order to do this an Epicurean had to control their desires, because desire itself was seen as painful. Not only will controlling one&#x27;s desires bring about &quot;aponia&quot;, as one will rarely suffer from not being physically satisfied, but controlling one&#x27;s desires will also help to bring about &quot;ataraxia&quot; because one will not be anxious about becoming discomforted since one would have so few desires anyway. The Epicureans divide desires into three classes: natural and necessary, natural but not necessary, and vain and empty:

*&quot;Natural and necessary&quot;: These desires are limited desires that are innately present in all humans; it is part of human nature to have them. They are necessary for one of three reasons: necessary for happiness, necessary for freedom from bodily discomfort, and necessary for life. Clothing and shelter would belong to the first two categories, while something like food would belong to the third.
*&quot;Natural but not necessary&quot;: These desires are innate to humans, but they do not need to be fulfilled for their happiness or their survival. Wanting to eat delicious food when one is hungry is an example of a natural but not necessary desire. The main problem with these desires is that they fail to substantially increase a person&#x27;s happiness, and at the same time require effort to obtain and are desired by people due to false beliefs that they are actually necessary. It is for this reason that they should be avoided.
*&quot;Vain and empty&quot;: These desires are neither innate to humans nor required for happiness or health; indeed, they are also limitless and can never be fulfilled. Desires of wealth or fame would fall in this class, and such desires are to be avoided because they will ultimately only bring about discomfort.

If one follows only natural and necessary desires, then, according to Epicurus, one would be able to reach &quot;aponia&quot; and &quot;ataraxia&quot; and thereby the highest form of happiness. Unnecessary and, especially, artificially produced desires were to be suppressed.

====Politics====
The Epicurean understanding of justice was inherently self-interested. Justice was deemed good because it was seen as mutually beneficial. Individuals would not act unjustly even if the act was initially unnoticed because of possibly being caught and punished. Both punishment and fear of punishment would cause a person disturbance and prevent them from being happy.

Epicurus was also an early thinker to develop the notion of justice as a social contract, and in part attempts to address issues with the society described in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;. The social contract theory established by Epicureanism is based on mutual agreement, not divine decree. He defined justice as an agreement made by people not to harm each other. The point of living in a society with laws and punishments is to be protected from harm so that one is free to pursue happiness. Because of this, laws that do not contribute to promoting human happiness are not just. He gave his own unique version of the ethic of reciprocity, which differs from other formulations by emphasizing minimizing harm and maximizing happiness for oneself and others:

Epicurean ideas on politics disagree with other philosophical traditions, namely the Stoic, Platonist and Aristotelian traditions. To Epicureans all our social relations are a matter of how we perceive each other, of customs and traditions. No one is inherently of higher value or meant to dominate another. That is because there is no metaphysical basis for the superiority of one kind of person, all people are made of the same atomic material and are thus naturally equal. Epicureans also discourage political participation and other involvement in politics. However Epicureans are not apolitical, it is possible that some political association could be seen as beneficial by some Epicureans. Some political associations could lead to certain benefits to the individual that would help to maximize pleasure and avoid physical or mental distress.

====Friendship====

Epicurus laid great emphasis on developing friendships as the basis of a satisfying life. The avoidance or freedom from hardship and fear is ideal to the Epicureans. While this avoidance or freedom could conceivably be achieved through political means, it was insisted by Epicurus that involvement in politics would not release one from fear and he advised against a life of politics. Epicurus also discouraged contributing to political society by starting a family, as the benefits of a wife and children are outweighed by the trouble brought about by having a family. Instead Epicurus encouraged a formation of a community of friends outside the traditional political state. This community of virtuous friends would focus on internal affairs and justice. However, Epicureanism is adaptable to circumstance as is the Epicurean approach to politics. The same approaches will not always work in protection from pain and fear. In some situations it will be more beneficial to have a family and in other situations it will be more beneficial to participate in politics. It is ultimately up to the Epicurean to analyse their circumstance and take whatever action befits the situation.

====Death====
Epicureanism rejects immortality. It believes in the soul, but suggests that the soul is mortal and material, just like the body. Epicurus rejected any possibility of an afterlife, while still contending that one need not fear death: &quot;Death is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us.&quot; From this doctrine arose the Epicurean Epitaph: &quot;Non fui, fui, non sum, non curo&quot; (&quot;I was not; I have been; I am not; I do not mind.&quot;), which is inscribed on the gravestones of his followers and seen on many ancient gravestones of the Roman Empire.

====Gods====
Epicureanism does not deny the existence of the gods; rather it denies their involvement in the world. According to Epicureanism, the gods do not interfere with human lives or the rest of the universe in any way – thus, it shuns the idea that frightening weather events are divine retribution. One of the fears the Epicurean ought to be freed from is fear relating to the actions of the gods.

The manner in which the Epicurean gods exist is still disputed. Some scholars say that Epicureanism believes that the gods exist outside the mind as material objects (the realist position), while others assert that the gods only exist in our minds as ideals (the idealist position). The realist position holds that Epicureans understand the gods as existing as physical and immortal beings made of atoms that reside somewhere in reality. However, the gods are completely separate from the rest of reality; they are uninterested in it, play no role in it, and remain completely undisturbed by it. Instead, the gods live in what is called the &quot;metakosmia&quot;, or the space between worlds. Contrarily, the idealist (sometimes called the &quot;non-realist position&quot; to avoid confusion) position holds that the gods are just idealized forms of the best human life, and it is thought that the gods were emblematic of the life one should aspire towards. The debate between these two positions was revived by A. A. Long and David Sedley in their 1987 book, &quot;The Hellenistic Philosophers&quot;, in which the two argued in favour of the idealist position. While a scholarly consensus has yet to be reached, the realist position remains the prevailing viewpoint at this time.

==Epicurean writings==
===On Nature===
On Nature () is the name of a philosophical treatise in 37 books consisting of lectures written by Epicurus, which can be considered his main work, however, it has mostly been lost. Some excerpts have survived compiled from burnt papyri scrolls found in the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum. Most of the surviving papyri are kept in the National Library of Naples. Important parts of Book II are preserved in the British Museum.

Since most of the 37 books &quot;On Nature&quot; are lost, the Principal Doctrines and Epicurus&#x27; Letters to Herodotus, Menoeceus, and Pythocles are the most authoritative writings on Epicureanism. Similarly, Lucretius&#x27; poem &quot;De rerum natura&quot; probably follows Epicurus&#x27; work.

===Principal doctrines===

The Principal Doctrines are forty authoritative conclusions set up as official doctrines by Epicurus, Metrodorus of Lampsacus, Hermarchus of Mitilene and Polyaenus of Lampsacus. The Principal Doctrines exemplify the Epicurean philosophers&#x27; practice of publishing summaries and outlines of their teachings for easy memorization. However, they are so concise and short that it&#x27;s difficult to understand them in depth without the context of additional commentaries and writings by ancient sources or by modern Epicurean practitioners, whenever possible. They are often cited as &quot;PDs&quot; in English.

Some of the Principal Doctrines are organized into groups and are meant to be studied together. The first four doctrines make up the Tetrapharmakos (Four Cures). PD&#x27;s 10-13 discuss the Epicurean philosophy of science. PD&#x27;s 18-21 explain the natural limits of desires and in time, and how the flesh is unable to learn these limits but the mind can. PD&#x27;s 22-25 deal with the importance of the canon, or the Epicurean standard of truth. PD&#x27;s 31-38 explain the Epicurean doctrines on justice based on mutual advantage and contractarianism. PD&#x27;s 39-40 call for an intimate society of friends.

====Tetrapharmakos====

Tetrapharmakos, or &quot;The four-part cure&quot;, is Philodemus of Gadara&#x27;s basic guideline as to how to live the happiest possible life, based on the first four of the doctrines. This poetic doctrine was handed down by an anonymous Epicurean who summed up Epicurus&#x27; philosophy on happiness in four simple lines:

===Letters of Epicurus===
Three letters of Epicurus are preserved by Diogenes Laertius.

====Letter to Herodotus====
Epicurus&#x27; &quot;Letter to Herodotus&quot; (not the historian) was written as an introduction to Epicurean philosophy and method of studying nature. It included the most complete detail of the ancient conversations that led to the development of atomist theory, a doctrine of innumerable worlds, and an explanation of the phenomenon of time that posits an early form of relativism. Epicurus&#x27; &quot;Letter to Herodotus&quot; appears to be a summary of &quot;On Nature&quot;, books I–XIII.

====Letter to Pythocles====
Epicurus&#x27; &quot;Letter to Pythocles&quot; is the second letter preserved by Diogenes Laertius in The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers. In Letter to Pythocles, Epicurus treats the things for which there is uncertainty in how they occur. His train of thought is explicated through meteorological phenomena: various weather events as well as celestial phenomena in space such as asteroids, the creation and destruction of cosmoi, and the paths of planetary bodies through space. In Epicurus&#x27; time, long before any modern technological advances such as microscopes or telescopes which allow us to establish greater knowledge of these phenomena, these were all examples of things that, as far as the limits of human knowledge extended, it was impossible to establish certainty with regards to their causes, or how they occurred. Epicurus elaborates on how one may reason regarding such things so as to come to reasonable conclusions without undue certainty, so as to maintain Ataraxia.

====Letter to Menoeceus====
Epicurus&#x27; &quot;Letter to Menoeceus&quot; is a summary of his ethical teachings written in the epistolary literary style, and addressed to a student. It addresses theology, the hierarchies of desires, how to carry choices and avoidances in order to achieve net pleasure, and other aspects of Epicurean ethics.

===Epicurea===
The Epicurea is a collection of texts, fragments, and testimonies by Epicurus that was collected by Hermann Usener in 1887. This work features a collection of writings by Epicurus that explain the values and beliefs of Ancient Epicurian philosophy.

===Other ancient testimonies===
One of the earliest Roman writers espousing Epicureanism was Amafinius, although his work has not survived. Other adherents to the teachings of Epicurus included Lucretius, who wrote the poem &quot;De rerum natura&quot; about the tenets of the philosophy. The Epicurean philosopher Philodemus of Gadara, until the 18th century only known as a poet of minor importance, rose to prominence as much of his work, along with other Epicurean material such as the lectures of Zeno of Sidon, was discovered in the Villa of the Papyri. Another major source of information is the Roman politician and philosopher Cicero, although he was highly critical, denouncing the Epicureans as unbridled hedonists, devoid of a sense of virtue and duty, and guilty of withdrawing from public life. Another ancient source is Diogenes of Oenoanda, who composed a large inscription at Oenoanda in Lycia. Diogenes Laërtius reports slanderous stories, circulated by Epicurus&#x27; opponents.

==Legacy==
===Later antiquity===
The early Christian writer Lactantius criticizes Epicurus at several points throughout his &quot;Divine Institutes&quot; and preserves the &quot;Riddle of Epicurus&quot;, or &quot;Problem of evil&quot;, a famous argument against the existence of an all-powerful and providential God or gods. This type of &quot;trilemma&quot; argument (God is omnipotent, God is good, but Evil exists) was one favoured by the ancient Greek skeptics, and this argument may have been wrongly attributed to Epicurus by Lactantius, who, from his Christian perspective, regarded Epicurus as an atheist. According to Reinhold F. Glei, it is settled that the argument of &quot;theodicy&quot; is from an academical source which is not only not Epicurean, but even anti-Epicurean. The earliest extant version of this &quot;trilemma&quot; appears in the writings of the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus.

Epikoros is a Jewish term figuratively meaning &quot;a heretic&quot;, cited in the Mishnah, referring to one who does not have a share in the world to come Although rabbinic literature does not make any specific reference to the Greek philosopher Epicurus, it is apparent that the term is derived from the philosopher&#x27;s name, in reference to his views which contradicted Jewish scripture, the strictly monotheistic conception of God in Judaism and the Jewish belief in the world to come.
===Middle Ages and Renaissance===
In Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, the Epicureans are depicted as heretics suffering in the sixth circle of hell. In fact, Epicurus appears to represent the ultimate heresy.

Francis Bacon wrote an related to Epicureanism:

There was an Epicurean vaunted, that divers of other sects of philosophers did after turn Epicureans, but there was never any Epicurean that turned to any other sect. Whereupon a philosopher that was of another sect, said; The reason was plain, for that cocks may be made capons, but capons could never be made cocks. 

This echoed what the Academic skeptic philosopher Arcesilaus had said when asked &quot;why it was that pupils from all the other schools went over to Epicurus, but converts were never made from the Epicureans?&quot; to which he responded: &quot;Because men may become eunuchs, but a eunuch never becomes a man.&quot;

===Modern revival===
In the 17th century, the French Franciscan priest, scientist and philosopher Pierre Gassendi wrote two books forcefully reviving Epicureanism. Shortly thereafter, and clearly influenced by Gassendi, Walter Charleton published several works on Epicureanism in English. Attacks by Christians continued, most forcefully by the Cambridge Platonists.

In modern times Thomas Jefferson referred to himself as an Epicurean:If I had time I would add to my little book the Greek, Latin and French texts, in columns side by side. And I wish I could subjoin a translation of Gassendi&#x27;s Syntagma of the doctrines of Epicurus, which, notwithstanding the calumnies of the Stoics and caricatures of Cicero, is the most rational system remaining of the philosophy of the ancients, as frugal of vicious indulgence, and fruitful of virtue as the hyperbolical extravagances of his rival sects.Other modern-day Epicureans were Gassendi, Walter Charleton, François Bernier, Saint-Évremond, Ninon de l&#x27;Enclos, Denis Diderot, Frances Wright and Jeremy Bentham.

In France, where perfumer/restaurateur Gérald Ghislain refers to himself as an Epicurean, Michel Onfray is developing a post-modern approach to Epicureanism. In his 2011 book titled &quot;The Swerve&quot;, Stephen Greenblatt identified himself as strongly sympathetic to Epicureanism and Lucretius. Humanistic Judaism as a denomination also claims the Epicurean label.

===Similarities with eastern philosophies===
Some scholars have drawn parallels between Epicureanism and some eastern philosophies that similarly emphasize atomism or a lack of divine interference, such as Jainism, Charvaka, and Buddhism. Epicureanism also resembles Buddhism in its belief that great excess leads to great dissatisfaction.

=== Misconceptions ===
In modern popular usage, an Epicurean is a connoisseur of the arts of life and the refinements of sensual pleasures; &quot;Epicureanism&quot; implies a love or knowledgeable enjoyment especially of good food and drink.

Because Epicureanism posits that pleasure is the ultimate good (&quot;telos&quot;), it has been commonly misunderstood since ancient times as a doctrine that advocates the partaking in fleeting pleasures such as sexual excess and decadent food. This is not the case. Epicurus regarded &quot;ataraxia&quot; (tranquility, freedom from fear) and &quot;aponia&quot; (absence of pain) as the height of happiness. He also considered prudence an important virtue and perceived excess and overindulgence to be contrary to the attainment of ataraxia and aponia. Epicurus preferred &quot;the good&quot;, and &quot;even wisdom and culture&quot;, to the &quot;pleasure of the stomach&quot;.

While Epicurus sought moderation at meals, he was also not averse to moderation in moderation, that is, to occasional luxury. Called &quot;The Garden&quot; for being based in what would have been a kitchen garden, his community also became known for its Eikas (Greek εἰκάς from εἴκοσῐ &quot;eíkosi&quot;, &quot;twenty&quot;), feasts of the twentieth (of the Greek month), which was otherwise considered sacred to the god Apollo, and also corresponding to the final day of the rites of initiation to the mysteries of Demeter.

<text>Robert I Estienne (; 15037 September 1559), known as &quot;Robertus Stephanus&quot; in Latin and sometimes referred to as &quot;Robert Stephens&quot;, was a 16th-century printer in Paris. He was the proprietor of the Estienne print shop after the death of his father Henri Estienne, the founder of the Estienne printing firm. Estienne published and republished many classical texts as well as Greek and Latin translations of the Bible. Known as &quot;Printer to the King&quot; in Latin, Hebrew, and Greek, Estienne&#x27;s most prominent work was the &quot;Thesaurus linguae latinae&quot; which is considered to be the foundation of modern Latin lexicography. Additionally, he was the first to print the New Testament divided into standard numbered verses.

Raised a Catholic, he became a Protestant late in his life. Many of his published Bibles included commentary which upset the Catholic theologians of the Sorbonne who sought to censor Estienne&#x27;s work. Eventually, overcome by the prejudice of the Sorbonne, Estienne and his family fled to Geneva where he continued his printing uncensored, publishing many of the works of John Calvin. In 1556 he became a citizen of Geneva, where he would die on 7 September 1559.

Of Estienne&#x27;s four sons, two became accomplished printers, one of whom was Henri Estienne who continued the legacy of his grandfather Estienne&#x27;s printing firm. Along with other printers, Estienne contributed to the &quot;Golden Age of French Typography&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Robert Estienne was born in Paris in 1503. The second son of the famous humanist printer Henri Estienne, he became knowledgeable in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. After his father&#x27;s death in 1520, the Estienne printing establishment was maintained by his father&#x27;s former partner Simon de Colines who also married Estienne&#x27;s mother, the widow Estienne. As Estienne was not yet of age at the time of his father&#x27;s death, Colines and Gilles Nepveu (the husband or fiancé of his sister Nicole) became his legal guardians. Estienne and Colines likely collaborated in Estienne print shop for a time. Colines was known for his exquisite type cutting, whereas Estienne was known for his accuracy.

In 1526, Robert Estienne assumed control of his father&#x27;s printing shop while Colines established his own firm nearby. The parties agreed to divide the house, printing equipment, and printing supplies in half. Colines moved his shop down the street from the Estienne shop. Though the nature of their relationship after this is largely unknown, scholars suggest that they had mutual respect for one another and may have continued to collaborate, sharing fonts and materials. Even though Estienne re-established his father&#x27;s printing shop in 1526, his first independent project as a scholar-printer can be traced back to 1524. He was in the process of publishing a Latin version of the Bible as he searched Paris for manuscripts. He had already printed a New Testament, and some slight alterations which he had introduced into the text brought upon him the censures of the faculty of theology. It was the first of a long series of disputes between him and that body. Around this time, he apparently joined the Reformed Church.

Estienne married Perrette Badius in 1526 whose father Josse Badius Ascensius owned a print shop, giving Estienne the resources to print that he lacked from his father&#x27;s materials alone. After her father&#x27;s death in 1535, Estienne merged the Estienne and Badius printing business. His first &quot;Biblia&quot; or version of the Vulgate Bible was published in 1527. While he was working on the Bible, he increased his revenue and reputation by publishing a series of octavos, which in this case were small, inexpensive educational books from scholars such as Cicero and Lucian. Estienne&#x27;s trade was primarily as printer-bookseller and though he did publish his own prints, he did not publish in partnership with other printers as was a common practice for printers of the time. 
===Latin classics===
With his title of &quot;royal typographer&quot; Robert Estienne promoted the Estienne print shop by his numerous editions of grammatical works and other schoolbooks (among them many of Melanchthon&#x27;s) and of classical and Patristic authors, such as Dio Cassius, Cicero, Sallust, Julius Caesar, Justin, Socrates Scholasticus, and Sozomen. During the first fifteen years of his career, Estienne focused his printing on five Latin classic authors, specifically, Cicero, Terence, Plautus, Pliny, and Virgil. He printed works from Horace and Persisus, but he printed them far less frequently. He nearly tripled the number of authors&#x27; works he published from 1541 to 1545. Scholars suggest that Estienne&#x27;s trouble with his published Bibles and the Catholic Church led him to publish more authors of Latin Classics as a buffer.

Many of Estienne&#x27;s published classics, especially the Greek editions (which were printed with typefaces made by Claude Garamond), were famous for their typographical elegance. The editiones principes issued from Estienne&#x27;s press were eight in number. He began with the &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; (1544) and ended with Appian (1551). The last was completed after Estienne&#x27;s departure from Paris by his brother Charles and appeared under Charles&#x27;s name. Estienne also printed numerous editions of Latin classics, of which the folio Virgil of 1532 is the most noteworthy. He printed a large number of Latin grammars and other educational works, many of which were written by Mathurin Cordier, his friend and co-worker in the cause of humanism. He was trained as a punchcutter, but no font has been identified as his. Estienne did, however, oversee the work of the best punchcutters of the time such as Claude Garamond and Guillaume Le Bé. Under Estienne, Garamond designed the Greek type used by the King of France which was used to print the first edition of &quot;Roman History&quot;. Consequently, Estienne was the first printer granted permission to use the &quot;grecs du roi&quot; or Greek types of the king. In the 1530s Estienne&#x27;s printing represents the first use of apostrophes and grave and acute accents in France. Moreover, Estienne was known as one of the printers responsible for adapting the Aldine roman type in France.

===Dictionaries===
One of the best printers of his time, Robert Estienne was asked to either compile a dictionary from the best Latin authors or make one himself; in 1531 he published &quot;Thesaurus linguae latinae&quot;, which is considered by some scholars to be the foundation of modern Latin lexicography. Moreover, this dictionary made Estienne the &quot;father of French lexicography&quot;. He had worked on it for two years, with the assistance only of Thierry of Beauvais. It was 964 pages and was improved in 1536 and 1543 in three volumes. Considered his &quot;greatest monument of Latin scholarship&quot;, he employed research assistants for the 1543 version: Andreas Gruntleus, Gerardus Clericus, and Adam Nodius. 

From his work on the &quot;Thesaurus linguae latinae&quot;, he published &quot;Dictionarium latino-gallicum&quot; in 1538 and &quot;Dictionaire françoislatin&quot; in 1540. These dictionaries were superior to others at the time because non-classical elements had been edited out; when determining words, they were checked for correctness and applicability in context; and citations were exclusively from classical authors. Furthermore, it applied consistency to word order since lexicographers disagreed about whether words should be ordered alphabetically or etymologically. Estienne&#x27;s thesaurus was alphabetical based on the first three letters of the word, then grouped etymologically. In the 1540s, he began publishing more concise school dictionaries. Many of these dictionaries were translated into other languages such as German and Flemish. From 1528 to 1580, he published several editions of &quot;Alphabetum graecum&quot;, a representation of Renaissance Greek orthography.

===Religious texts===
Although Robert Estienne was printing Bibles in Latin as early as 1528, he printed his first Greek New Testament in 1546. Despite its similarity to the works of Erasmus, Estienne did not credit Erasmus and rather claimed to be influenced by ancient codices. The first two are beautiful Greek texts, called &quot;O mirifica&quot;. The third and most significant is known as the Editio Regia or the &quot;Royal Edition&quot;, published in 1550 for King Henri II. Typographically it is significant because the Greek font made by Garamond became the most widely used Greek font for European printers. In it he combined over 15 Greek sources with annotations in the margins. The 1550 version became known as the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;, the standard text for many generations. The 1551 edition contains Erasmus&#x27;s Latin translation and the Vulgate. Scholars have described his editing of the Vulgate as mediocre and lacking in effort or depth. In this edition of the Vulgate, Estienne introduced the division of the New Testament into chapter and verses for the first time. After he finished the Vulgate, he began developing his style. He was interested in working on original texts rather than translations. Additionally, he was interested in writing commentaries to help an average reader understand the academic texts to the point of adding his own interpretation. Moreover, Estienne&#x27;s commentary in the fourth edition of the Greek New Testament initiated the antagonism of the Sorbonne against Estienne.

He published two editions of the Hebrew Bible: one in 13 volumes and another one in 10 volumes. Estienne acquired Vulgate manuscripts while in Paris and printed a number of editions throughout his career. The principal editions are the 1527, 1532, 1540 (one of the ornaments of his press), and 1546. In the 1532 edition, he placed the Acts in between the gospels and epistles of Paul as is standard in most Bibles. Before this, the Acts were usually found at the end. Furthermore, typographer and printing historian Stanley Morison claimed that Estienne&#x27;s 1532 folio Bible contained, &quot;what is probably the finest use ever made of [the Garamond] letter.&quot; Estienne printed this edition of the Bible in a grand folio format; his expected buyers were the nobility and the wealthy rather than the university faculty/students. Though in 1543, his style shifted to that of sextodecimo format, printing Bibles in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, which assumes the buyers are students and professors.

His editions, especially that of 1546, containing a new translation at the side of the Vulgate, was the subject of sharp and acrimonious criticism from the clergy. In 1539 he received the distinguishing title of &quot;Printer to the king&quot; for Latin and Hebrew, and later for Greek. This incited anger from the Sorbonne because Estienne had converted from Catholicism to Protestantism. The Sorbonne was opposed to the humanist ideals of the time and was attempting to censor Estienne&#x27;s publishing firm. He was protected by Francis I of France with whom he enjoyed strong patronage and friendship; Estienne aided Francis I in printing documents ratifying policies which established and justified his power. Later, Estienne published a document to inform the public how alliances between French royalty, German Protestants, and Turkish royalty were beneficial for European religious peace. In 1538, Francis I requested that Estienne give a copy of every Greek book he had printed to create the royal library, which became the first copyright library. However, after Francis I died in 1547 and was succeeded by Henry II, Estienne fled to Geneva around 1550. With him, he brought his printing material, including his Greek type made by Garamond.

===Geneva===
On his arrival at Geneva, Robert Estienne published a defense against the attacks of the Sorbonne in 1552 called his &quot;Réponse&quot;. It was first published in Latin. He later translated it into French and published it again. The central theme of his &quot;Réponse&quot; is that the Sorbonne had a great ability to persuade or intimidate people. Estienne established his printing firm in Geneva and his brother Charles helped run the firm in Paris. However, after Charles died in a debtors&#x27; prison, Robert II (the son of Robert I) took over the business. In Geneva, Estienne issued the French Bible in 1553 and many of John Calvin&#x27;s writings, including the &quot;Institutio&quot; in 1553. His 1556 edition of the Latin Bible contained the translation of the Old Testament by Santes Pagninus and the first edition of Theodore Beza&#x27;s Latin edition of the New Testament. In 1556 he became a citizen of the Republic of Geneva, where he died on 7 September 1559. Estienne&#x27;s other sons, Henri II and François, helped Estienne run the shop in Geneva after the death of Estienne. Robert Estienne was one of the most successful printers in the Estienne family, and one of the best scholars of the time. It was in part, due to Estienne that the reign of Francis I was considered the &quot;Golden Age of French Typography.&quot;

==Pressmarks==
Robert Estienne used several pressmarks or devices on his prints. Estienne&#x27;s pressmark with an olive branch and a serpent wound around a spear was first seen in 1544 on the title page of &quot;Preparatio Evangelica&quot;. It was symbolic of wisdom in times of war and peace. The motto below it translates to &quot;to the wise king and the valiant warrior&quot;. Another device was called &quot;Oliva Stephanorum&quot; or the olive of the Stephens family with the words of Romans 11:20, &quot;Noli altum sapere&quot; (&quot;Do not be proud&quot;) and later &quot;Noli altum sapere, sed time ...&quot; (&quot;Be not high-minded but fear&quot;). The device shows a man standing by an olive tree. Scholars believe this man is Paul the Apostle who is affirming the importance of faith. This is consistent with Estienne&#x27;s connection to the Protestant Reformation. The olive tree is meant to represent the tree of knowledge. The device may have been a subtle attack on the Catholic theologians at the Sorbonne for their &quot;lack of humility&quot;. Pressmarks function best when they are immediately recognized, and scholars criticize Estienne&#x27;s pressmarks for not being easily recognizable.
== Family ==
Robert Estienne encouraged his four sons to study and perfect his professions. His will indicated that he wished all of his sons follow in his profession. Two of Robert&#x27;s sons, Henri and Robert became successful printers. François (born 1540) printed in Geneva from 1562 to 1582. As well as issuing editions of the Bible in Latin and French, he published some of Calvin&#x27;s works.

Robert Estienne II (1530–1570) studied Hebrew as his father recommended. Uninterested in the Reformation, he stayed in Paris instead of following his father to Geneva, opening his own printing shop in 1556. He earned the title of &quot;Typographus regius&quot; in 1563. He printed the New Testament of 1568–1569, a reprint of his father&#x27;s first edition. He printed the Decalogue in Hebrew and Aramaic in 1566. Additionally, Estienne printed books in Hebrew for professors in Paris, but fled to Geneva in 1569, because he worked for Anglican clients. He died in 1570.

<text>Henri Estienne ( , ; 1528 or 15311598), also known as Henricus Stephanus ( ), was a French printer and classical scholar. He was the eldest son of Robert Estienne. He was instructed in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew by his father and would eventually take over the Estienne printing firm which his father owned in 1559 when his father died. His most well-known work was the &quot;Thesaurus graecae linguae&quot;, which was printed in five volumes. The basis of Greek lexicology, no thesaurus would rival that of Estienne&#x27;s for three hundred years.

Among his many publications of Greek authors, his publications of Plato are the source of Stephanus pagination, which is still used to refer to Plato&#x27;s works. Estienne died in Lyon in 1598.

==Life==
Henri Estienne was born in Paris in 1528 or 1531. His father instructed him in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and typography, and according to a note in his edition of &quot;Aulus Gellius&quot; (1585), he picked up some Latin as a child, as that language was used as a in the multi-national household. However, he was primarily instructed in Greek by Pierre Danès. He was also educated by other French scholars such as Adrianus Turnebus. He began working for his father&#x27;s business at age eighteen and was employed by his father to collate a manuscript of Dionysius of Halicarnassus. In 1547, as part of his training, he traveled to Italy, England, and Flanders, where he learned Spanish and busied himself in collecting and collating manuscripts for his father&#x27;s press. Around 1551, Robert Estienne fled to Geneva with his family, including Henri Estienne, to escape religious persecution in Paris. The same year, he translated Calvin&#x27;s catechism into Greek, which was printed in 1554 in his father&#x27;s printing room.

Estienne published the &quot;Anacreon&quot; in 1554, which was his first independent work. Afterwards, he returned to Italy to assist the Aldine Press in Venice. In Italy, he discovered a copy of Diodorus Siculus in Rome, and returned to Geneva in 1555. In 1557 he likely had a printing establishment of his own, advertising himself as the &quot;Parisian printer&quot; (&quot;typographus parisiensis&quot;). The following year he assumed the title &quot;illustris viri Huldrici Fuggeri typographus&quot; from his patron, Ulrich Fugger who saved him from financial despair after the death of his father. Estienne published the first anthology that included sections from Parmenides, Empedocles, and other Pre-Socratic philosophers.

In 1559, on his father&#x27;s death, Estienne assumed charge of his presses and became Printer of the Republic of Geneva. In the same year he produced his own Latin translation of the works of Sextus Empiricus, and an edition of Diodorus Siculus based on his earlier discoveries. In 1565, he printed a large French Bible. The following year he published his best-known French work, the &quot;Apologie pour Hérodote&quot;. Some passages being considered objectionable by the Geneva consistory, he was compelled to cancel the pages containing them. The book became highly popular, and within sixteen years twelve editions were printed. Estienne used the type he inherited and did not invent any new types.

His most celebrated work, the &quot;Thesaurus graecae linguae&quot; or Greek thesaurus, appeared in five volumes in 1572. This thesaurus was a sequel to Robert Estienne&#x27;s Latin thesaurus. The basis of Greek lexicography, a Greek thesaurus to rival that of Estiennes was not printed for over 300 years. This work was begun by his father and served up to the nineteenth century as the basis of Greek lexicography. However, the sale of this thesaurus was impeded due to its high price and the printing of an abridged copy later. In 1576 and 1587, Estienne published two Greek versions of the New Testament. The 1576 version contained the first scientific treatise on the language of the apostolic writers. The 1587 version contained a discussion on the ancient divisions of the text. Estienne&#x27;s other publications included those of Herodotus, Plato, Horace, Virgil, Plutarch, and Pliny the Elder. He also published an edition of Aeschylus, in which &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was printed in its entirety and as a separate play for the first time.
In 1578 he published the first and one of the most important editions of the complete works of Plato, translated by Jean de Serres, with commentary. This work is the source of the standard &quot;Stephanus numbers&quot; used by scholars today to refer to the works of Plato.

The publication in 1578 of his &quot;Deux Dialogues du nouveau françois italianizé&quot; brought him into a fresh dispute with the consistory. To avoid their censure he went to Paris, and resided at the French court for a year. On his return to Geneva he was summoned before the consistory and was imprisoned for a week. From this time his life became more and more nomadic. He traveled to Basel, Heidelberg, Vienna, and Pest. He also spent time in Paris and other regions in France. These journeys were undertaken partly in the hope of procuring patrons and purchasers, for the large sums which he had spent on such publications as the Thesaurus and the Plato of 1578 had almost ruined him. He published a concordance of the New Testament in 1594.

After visiting the University of Montpellier, where Isaac Casaubon, his son-in-law, was now professor, he started for Paris. He was taken ill in Lyon, and died there at the end of January 1598.

==Family==
Henri Estienne was married three times. He married Marguerite Pillot in 1555, Barbe de Wille in 1556, and Abigail Pouppart in 1586. Estienne had fourteen children, three of whom survived him. His daughter was married to Isaac Casaubon. His son Paul (born 1567) assumed control of the presses in Geneva with Casaubon but he fled to Paris from the authorities. Paul&#x27;s son Antoine became &quot;Printer to the King&quot; in Paris and &quot;Guardian of the Greek Matrices&quot;; however his death in 1674 ended the nearly two-century-long Estienne printing business.

==Legacy==
Henri Estienne is considered by some scholars to be the most prominent printer in the Estienne family. Estienne was one of the &quot;greatest and last scholarly editors and publishers of the Renaissance.&quot;

<text>In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) states that, under appropriate conditions, the distribution of a normalized version of the sample mean converges to a standard normal distribution. This holds even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed. There are several versions of the CLT, each applying in the context of different conditions.

The theorem is a key concept in probability theory because it implies that probabilistic and statistical methods that work for normal distributions can be applicable to many problems involving other types of distributions.

This theorem has seen many changes during the formal development of probability theory. Previous versions of the theorem date back to 1811, but in its modern form it was only precisely stated as late as 1920.

In statistics, the CLT can be stated as: let formula_1 denote a statistical sample of size formula_2 from a population with expected value (average) formula_3 and finite positive variance formula_4, and let formula_5 denote the sample mean (which is itself a random variable). Then the limit as formula_6 of the distribution of formula_7 is a normal distribution with mean formula_8 and variance formula_4.

In other words, suppose that a large sample of observations is obtained, each observation being randomly produced in a way that does not depend on the values of the other observations, and the average (arithmetic mean) of the observed values is computed. If this procedure is performed many times, resulting in a collection of observed averages, the central limit theorem says that if the sample size is large enough, the probability distribution of these averages will closely approximate a normal distribution.

The central limit theorem has several variants. In its common form, the random variables must be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This requirement can be weakened; convergence of the mean to the normal distribution also occurs for non-identical distributions or for non-independent observations if they comply with certain conditions.

The earliest version of this theorem, that the normal distribution may be used as an approximation to the binomial distribution, is the de Moivre–Laplace theorem.

==Independent sequences==
===Classical CLT===
Let formula_10 be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables having a distribution with expected value given by formula_3 and finite variance given by formula_12 Suppose we are interested in the sample average
formula_13

By the law of large numbers, the sample average converges almost surely (and therefore also converges in probability) to the expected value formula_3 as formula_15

The classical central limit theorem describes the size and the distributional form of the stochastic fluctuations around the deterministic number formula_3 during this convergence. More precisely, it states that as formula_2 gets larger, the distribution of the normalized mean formula_18, i.e. the difference between the sample average formula_19 and its limit formula_20 scaled by the factor formula_21, approaches the normal distribution with mean formula_22 and variance formula_12 For large enough formula_24 the distribution of formula_19 gets arbitrarily close to the normal distribution with mean formula_3 and variance formula_27

The usefulness of the theorem is that the distribution of formula_18 approaches normality regardless of the shape of the distribution of the individual formula_29 Formally, the theorem can be stated as follows:

 \mathcal{N}\left(0,\sigma^2\right) .&lt;/math&gt;}}

In the case formula_30 convergence in distribution means that the cumulative distribution functions of formula_18 converge pointwise to the cdf of the formula_32 distribution: for every real number formula_33
formula_34
where formula_35 is the standard normal cdf evaluated at formula_36 The convergence is uniform in formula_37 in the sense that
formula_38
where formula_39 denotes the least upper bound (or supremum) of the set.

===Lyapunov CLT===
In this variant of the central limit theorem the random variables formula_40 have to be independent, but not necessarily identically distributed. The theorem also requires that random variables formula_41 have moments of some order and that the rate of growth of these moments is limited by the Lyapunov condition given below.

 \, \sum_{i=1}^{n} \operatorname E\left[\left|X_{i} - \mu_{i}\right|^{2+\delta}\right] = 0&lt;/math&gt;
is satisfied, then a sum of formula_42 converges in distribution to a standard normal random variable, as formula_43 goes to infinity:
formula_44}}

In practice it is usually easiest to check Lyapunov&#x27;s condition for 

If a sequence of random variables satisfies Lyapunov&#x27;s condition, then it also satisfies Lindeberg&#x27;s condition. The converse implication, however, does not hold.

===Lindeberg (-Feller) CLT===
In the same setting and with the same notation as above, the Lyapunov condition can be replaced with the following weaker one (from Lindeberg in 1920).

Suppose that for every formula_45
formula_46
where formula_47 is the indicator function. Then the distribution of the standardized sums
formula_48
converges towards the standard normal distribution 

===CLT for the sum of a random number of random variables===

Rather than summing an integer number formula_2 of random variables and taking formula_50, the sum can be of a random number formula_51 of random variables, with conditions on formula_51.

 \xrightarrow{\quad d \quad} \mathcal{N}(0,1)
&lt;/math&gt;
where formula_53 denotes convergence in distribution and formula_54 is the normal distribution with mean 0, variance 1.
Then
:formula_55

===Multidimensional CLT===
Proofs that use characteristic functions can be extended to cases where each individual formula_56 is a random vector in with mean vector formula_57 and covariance matrix formula_58 (among the components of the vector), and these random vectors are independent and identically distributed. The multidimensional central limit theorem states that when scaled, sums converge to a multivariate normal distribution. Summation of these vectors is done component-wise. 

For formula_59 let
formula_60
be independent random vectors. The sum of the random vectors formula_61 is
formula_62
and their average is
formula_63
Therefore,
formula_64

The multivariate central limit theorem states that
formula_65
where the covariance matrix formula_66 is equal to
formula_67

The multivariate central limit theorem can be proved using the Cramér–Wold theorem.

The rate of convergence is given by the following Berry–Esseen type result:

It is unknown whether the factor formula_68 is necessary.

== The Generalized Central Limit Theorem ==

The Generalized Central Limit Theorem (GCLT) was an effort of multiple mathematicians (Bernstein, Lindeberg, Lévy, Feller, Kolmogorov, and others) over the period from 1920 to 1937. The first published complete proof of the GCLT was in 1937 by Paul Lévy in French. An English language version of the complete proof of the GCLT is available in the translation of Gnedenko and Kolmogorov&#x27;s 1954 book.

The statement of the GCLT is as follows:

:&quot;A non-degenerate random variable&quot; &quot;Z&quot; &quot;is &quot;α&quot;-stable for some&quot; 0 &lt; &quot;α&quot; ≤ 2 &quot;if and only if there is an independent, identically distributed sequence of random variables&quot; &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, &quot;X&quot;3, &quot;... and constants&quot; &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; &gt; 0, &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; ∈ ℝ &quot;with&quot;

::&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; (&quot;X&quot;1 + ... + &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) − &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; → &quot;Z&quot;.

:&quot;Here → means the sequence of random variable sums converges in distribution; i.e., the corresponding distributions satisfy&quot; &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) &quot;at all continuity points of&quot; &quot;F.&quot;

In other words, if sums of independent, identically distributed random variables converge in distribution to some &quot;Z&quot;, then &quot;Z&quot; must be a stable distribution.

==Dependent processes==

===CLT under weak dependence===
A useful generalization of a sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables is a mixing random process in discrete time; &quot;mixing&quot; means, roughly, that random variables temporally far apart from one another are nearly independent. Several kinds of mixing are used in ergodic theory and probability theory. See especially strong mixing (also called α-mixing) defined by formula_69 where formula_70 is so-called strong mixing coefficient.

A simplified formulation of the central limit theorem under strong mixing is:

&lt;/math&gt; converges in distribution to formula_71.}}

In fact,
formula_72
where the series converges absolutely.

The assumption formula_73 cannot be omitted, since the asymptotic normality fails for formula_74 where formula_75 are another stationary sequence.

There is a stronger version of the theorem: the assumption formula_76 is replaced with and the assumption formula_77 is replaced with
formula_78

Existence of such formula_79 ensures the conclusion. For encyclopedic treatment of limit theorems under mixing conditions see .

===Martingale difference CLT===

&lt;/math&gt; converges in distribution to formula_80 as formula_81.}}

==Remarks==

===Proof of classical CLT===
The central limit theorem has a proof using characteristic functions. It is similar to the proof of the (weak) law of large numbers.

Assume formula_82 are independent and identically distributed random variables, each with mean formula_83 and finite variance The sum formula_84 has mean formula_85 and variance Consider the random variable
formula_86
where in the last step we defined the new random variables each with zero mean and unit variance The characteristic function of formula_87 is given by
formula_88
where in the last step we used the fact that all of the formula_89 are identically distributed. The characteristic function of formula_90 is, by Taylor&#x27;s theorem,
formula_91
where formula_92 is &quot;little notation&quot; for some function of formula_93 that goes to zero more rapidly than By the limit of the exponential function the characteristic function of formula_94 equals
formula_95

All of the higher order terms vanish in the limit The right hand side equals the characteristic function of a standard normal distribution formula_80, which implies through Lévy&#x27;s continuity theorem that the distribution of formula_87 will approach formula_98 as Therefore, the sample average
formula_99
is such that 
formula_100
converges to the normal distribution from which the central limit theorem follows.

===Convergence to the limit===
The central limit theorem gives only an asymptotic distribution. As an approximation for a finite number of observations, it provides a reasonable approximation only when close to the peak of the normal distribution; it requires a very large number of observations to stretch into the tails.

The convergence in the central limit theorem is uniform because the limiting cumulative distribution function is continuous. If the third central moment formula_101 exists and is finite, then the speed of convergence is at least on the order of formula_102 (see Berry–Esseen theorem). Stein&#x27;s method can be used not only to prove the central limit theorem, but also to provide bounds on the rates of convergence for selected metrics.

The convergence to the normal distribution is monotonic, in the sense that the entropy of formula_87 increases monotonically to that of the normal distribution.

The central limit theorem applies in particular to sums of independent and identically distributed discrete random variables. A sum of discrete random variables is still a discrete random variable, so that we are confronted with a sequence of discrete random variables whose cumulative probability distribution function converges towards a cumulative probability distribution function corresponding to a continuous variable (namely that of the normal distribution). This means that if we build a histogram of the realizations of the sum of independent identical discrete variables, the piecewise-linear curve that joins the centers of the upper faces of the rectangles forming the histogram converges toward a Gaussian curve as approaches infinity; this relation is known as de Moivre–Laplace theorem. The binomial distribution article details such an application of the central limit theorem in the simple case of a discrete variable taking only two possible values.

===Common misconceptions===
Studies have shown that the central limit theorem is subject to several common but serious misconceptions, some of which appear in widely used textbooks. These include: 
* The misconceived belief that the theorem applies to random sampling of any variable, rather than to the mean values (or sums) of iid random variables extracted from a population by repeated sampling. That is, the theorem assumes the random sampling produces a sampling distribution formed from different values of means (or sums) of such random variables. 
* The misconceived belief that the theorem ensures that random sampling leads to the emergence of a normal distribution for sufficiently large samples of any random variable, regardless of the population distribution. In reality, such sampling asymptotically reproduces the properties of the population, an intuitive result underpinned by the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem. 
* The misconceived belief that the theorem leads to a good approximation of a normal distribution for sample sizes greater than around 30, allowing reliable inferences regardless of the nature of the population. In reality, this empirical rule of thumb has no valid justification, and can lead to seriously flawed inferences. See Z-test for where the approximation holds.

===Relation to the law of large numbers===
The law of large numbers as well as the central limit theorem are partial solutions to a general problem: &quot;What is the limiting behavior of as approaches infinity?&quot; In mathematical analysis, asymptotic series are one of the most popular tools employed to approach such questions.

Suppose we have an asymptotic expansion of formula_104:
formula_105

Dividing both parts by and taking the limit will produce , the coefficient of the highest-order term in the expansion, which represents the rate at which changes in its leading term.
formula_106

Informally, one can say: &quot; grows approximately as &quot;. Taking the difference between and its approximation and then dividing by the next term in the expansion, we arrive at a more refined statement about :
formula_107

Here one can say that the difference between the function and its approximation grows approximately as . The idea is that dividing the function by appropriate normalizing functions, and looking at the limiting behavior of the result, can tell us much about the limiting behavior of the original function itself.

Informally, something along these lines happens when the sum, , of independent identically distributed random variables, , is studied in classical probability theory. If each has finite mean , then by the law of large numbers, . If in addition each has finite variance , then by the central limit theorem,
formula_108
where is distributed as . This provides values of the first two constants in the informal expansion
formula_109

In the case where the do not have finite mean or variance, convergence of the shifted and rescaled sum can also occur with different centering and scaling factors:
formula_110
or informally
formula_111

Distributions which can arise in this way are called &quot;stable&quot;. Clearly, the normal distribution is stable, but there are also other stable distributions, such as the Cauchy distribution, for which the mean or variance are not defined. The scaling factor may be proportional to , for any ; it may also be multiplied by a slowly varying function of .

The law of the iterated logarithm specifies what is happening &quot;in between&quot; the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. Specifically it says that the normalizing function , intermediate in size between of the law of large numbers and of the central limit theorem, provides a non-trivial limiting behavior.

===Alternative statements of the theorem===

====Density functions====
The density of the sum of two or more independent variables is the convolution of their densities (if these densities exist). Thus the central limit theorem can be interpreted as a statement about the properties of density functions under convolution: the convolution of a number of density functions tends to the normal density as the number of density functions increases without bound. These theorems require stronger hypotheses than the forms of the central limit theorem given above. Theorems of this type are often called local limit theorems. See Petrov for a particular local limit theorem for sums of independent and identically distributed random variables.

====Characteristic functions====
Since the characteristic function of a convolution is the product of the characteristic functions of the densities involved, the central limit theorem has yet another restatement: the product of the characteristic functions of a number of density functions becomes close to the characteristic function of the normal density as the number of density functions increases without bound, under the conditions stated above. Specifically, an appropriate scaling factor needs to be applied to the argument of the characteristic function.

An equivalent statement can be made about Fourier transforms, since the characteristic function is essentially a Fourier transform.

===Calculating the variance===
Let be the sum of random variables. Many central limit theorems provide conditions such that converges in distribution to (the normal distribution with mean 0, variance 1) as . In some cases, it is possible to find a constant and function such that converges in distribution to as .

==Extensions==

===Products of positive random variables===
The logarithm of a product is simply the sum of the logarithms of the factors. Therefore, when the logarithm of a product of random variables that take only positive values approaches a normal distribution, the product itself approaches a log-normal distribution. Many physical quantities (especially mass or length, which are a matter of scale and cannot be negative) are the products of different random factors, so they follow a log-normal distribution. This multiplicative version of the central limit theorem is sometimes called Gibrat&#x27;s law.

Whereas the central limit theorem for sums of random variables requires the condition of finite variance, the corresponding theorem for products requires the corresponding condition that the density function be square-integrable.

==Beyond the classical framework==
Asymptotic normality, that is, convergence to the normal distribution after appropriate shift and rescaling, is a phenomenon much more general than the classical framework treated above, namely, sums of independent random variables (or vectors). New frameworks are revealed from time to time; no single unifying framework is available for now.

===Convex body===
These two -close distributions have densities (in fact, log-concave densities), thus, the total variance distance between them is the integral of the absolute value of the difference between the densities. Convergence in total variation is stronger than weak convergence.

An important example of a log-concave density is a function constant inside a given convex body and vanishing outside; it corresponds to the uniform distribution on the convex body, which explains the term &quot;central limit theorem for convex bodies&quot;.

Another example: where and . If then factorizes into which means are independent. In general, however, they are dependent.

The condition ensures that are of zero mean and uncorrelated; still, they need not be independent, nor even pairwise independent. By the way, pairwise independence cannot replace independence in the classical central limit theorem.

Here is a Berry–Esseen type result.

 \int_a^b e^{-\frac{1}{2} t^2} \, dt \right| \le \frac{C}{n} &lt;/math&gt;
for all ; here is a universal (absolute) constant. Moreover, for every such that ,
formula_112}}

The distribution of need not be approximately normal (in fact, it can be uniform). However, the distribution of is close to formula_71 (in the total variation distance) for most vectors according to the uniform distribution on the sphere .

===Lacunary trigonometric series===
===Gaussian polytopes===
The same also holds in all dimensions greater than 2.

The polytope is called a Gaussian random polytope.

A similar result holds for the number of vertices (of the Gaussian polytope), the number of edges, and in fact, faces of all dimensions.

===Linear functions of orthogonal matrices===
A linear function of a matrix is a linear combination of its elements (with given coefficients), where is the matrix of the coefficients; see Trace (linear algebra)#Inner product.

A random orthogonal matrix is said to be distributed uniformly, if its distribution is the normalized Haar measure on the orthogonal group ; see Rotation matrix#Uniform random rotation matrices.

===Subsequences===
===Random walk on a crystal lattice===

The central limit theorem may be established for the simple random walk on a crystal lattice (an infinite-fold abelian covering graph over a finite graph), and is used for design of crystal structures.

==Applications and examples==
A simple example of the central limit theorem is rolling many identical, unbiased dice. The distribution of the sum (or average) of the rolled numbers will be well approximated by a normal distribution. Since real-world quantities are often the balanced sum of many unobserved random events, the central limit theorem also provides a partial explanation for the prevalence of the normal probability distribution. It also justifies the approximation of large-sample statistics to the normal distribution in controlled experiments.

===Regression===
Regression analysis, and in particular ordinary least squares, specifies that a dependent variable depends according to some function upon one or more independent variables, with an additive error term. Various types of statistical inference on the regression assume that the error term is normally distributed. This assumption can be justified by assuming that the error term is actually the sum of many independent error terms; even if the individual error terms are not normally distributed, by the central limit theorem their sum can be well approximated by a normal distribution.

===Other illustrations===

Given its importance to statistics, a number of papers and computer packages are available that demonstrate the convergence involved in the central limit theorem.

==History==
Dutch mathematician Henk Tijms writes:

Sir Francis Galton described the Central Limit Theorem in this way:

The actual term &quot;central limit theorem&quot; (in German: &quot;zentraler Grenzwertsatz&quot;) was first used by George Pólya in 1920 in the title of a paper. Pólya referred to the theorem as &quot;central&quot; due to its importance in probability theory. According to Le Cam, the French school of probability interprets the word &quot;central&quot; in the sense that &quot;it describes the behaviour of the centre of the distribution as opposed to its tails&quot;. The abstract of the paper &quot;On the central limit theorem of calculus of probability and the problem of moments&quot; by Pólya in 1920 translates as follows.

A thorough account of the theorem&#x27;s history, detailing Laplace&#x27;s foundational work, as well as Cauchy&#x27;s, Bessel&#x27;s and Poisson&#x27;s contributions, is provided by Hald. Two historical accounts, one covering the development from Laplace to Cauchy, the second the contributions by von Mises, Pólya, Lindeberg, Lévy, and Cramér during the 1920s, are given by Hans Fischer. Le Cam describes a period around 1935. Bernstein presents a historical discussion focusing on the work of Pafnuty Chebyshev and his students Andrey Markov and Aleksandr Lyapunov that led to the first proofs of the CLT in a general setting.

A curious footnote to the history of the Central Limit Theorem is that a proof of a result similar to the 1922 Lindeberg CLT was the subject of Alan Turing&#x27;s 1934 Fellowship Dissertation for King&#x27;s College at the University of Cambridge. Only after submitting the work did Turing learn it had already been proved. Consequently, Turing&#x27;s dissertation was not published.

<doc id="39407" wikidata="Q272621" url="?curid=39407" title="Dirac equation">
<text>In particle physics, the Dirac equation is a relativistic wave equation derived by British physicist Paul Dirac in 1928. In its free form, or including electromagnetic interactions, it describes all spin-1/2 massive particles, called &quot;Dirac particles&quot;, such as electrons and quarks for which parity is a symmetry. It is consistent with both the principles of quantum mechanics and the theory of special relativity, and was the first theory to account fully for special relativity in the context of quantum mechanics. It was validated by accounting for the fine structure of the hydrogen spectrum in a completely rigorous way. It has become vital in the building of the Standard Model.

The equation also implied the existence of a new form of matter, &quot;antimatter&quot;, previously unsuspected and unobserved and which was experimentally confirmed several years later. It also provided a &quot;theoretical&quot; justification for the introduction of several component wave functions in Pauli&#x27;s phenomenological theory of spin. The wave functions in the Dirac theory are vectors of four complex numbers (known as bispinors), two of which resemble the Pauli wavefunction in the non-relativistic limit, in contrast to the Schrödinger equation which described wave functions of only one complex value. Moreover, in the limit of zero mass, the Dirac equation reduces to the Weyl equation.

In the context of quantum field theory, the Dirac equation is reinterpreted to describe quantum fields corresponding to spin- particles.

Dirac did not fully appreciate the importance of his results; however, the entailed explanation of spin as a consequence of the union of quantum mechanics and relativity—and the eventual discovery of the positron—represents one of the great triumphs of theoretical physics. This accomplishment has been described as fully on par with the works of Newton, Maxwell, and Einstein before him. The equation has been deemed by some physicists to be the &quot;real seed of modern physics&quot;. The equation has also been described as the &quot;centerpiece of relativistic quantum mechanics&quot;, with it also stated that &quot;the equation is perhaps the most important one in all of quantum mechanics&quot;.

The Dirac equation is inscribed upon a plaque on the floor of Westminster Abbey. Unveiled on 13 November 1995, the plaque commemorates Dirac&#x27;s life.

== History ==
The Dirac equation in the form originally proposed by Dirac is:
formula_1
where is the wave function for an electron of rest mass with spacetime coordinates . are the components of the momentum, understood to be the momentum operator in the Schrödinger equation. is the speed of light, and is the reduced Planck constant; these fundamental physical constants reflect special relativity and quantum mechanics, respectively. α and β are 4x4 Gamma matrices encoding the spin properties of relativistic particles and ensuring the equation&#x27;s correct transformation under Lorentz transformations.

Dirac&#x27;s purpose in casting this equation was to explain the behavior of the relativistically moving electron, thus allowing the atom to be treated in a manner consistent with relativity. He hoped that the corrections introduced this way might have a bearing on the problem of atomic spectra.

Up until that time, attempts to make the old quantum theory of the atom compatible with the theory of relativity—which were based on discretizing the angular momentum stored in the electron&#x27;s possibly non-circular orbit of the atomic nucleus—had failed, and the new quantum mechanics of Heisenberg, Pauli, Jordan, Schrödinger, and Dirac himself had not developed sufficiently to treat this problem. Although Dirac&#x27;s original intentions were satisfied, his equation had far deeper implications for the structure of matter and introduced new mathematical classes of objects that are now essential elements of fundamental physics.

The new elements in this equation are the four matrices , , and , and the four-component wave function . There are four components in because the evaluation of it at any given point in configuration space is a bispinor. It is interpreted as a superposition of a spin-up electron, a spin-down electron, a spin-up positron, and a spin-down positron.

The matrices and are all Hermitian and are involutory:
formula_2
and they all mutually anti-commute:
formula_3

These matrices and the form of the wave function have a deep mathematical significance. The algebraic structure represented by the gamma matrices had been created some 50 years earlier by the English mathematician W. K. Clifford. In turn, Clifford&#x27;s ideas had emerged from the mid-19th-century work of German mathematician Hermann Grassmann in his &quot;Lineare Ausdehnungslehre&quot; (&quot;Theory of Linear Expansion&quot;). 

=== Making the Schrödinger equation relativistic ===
The Dirac equation is superficially similar to the Schrödinger equation for a massive free particle:
formula_4

The left side represents the square of the momentum operator divided by twice the mass, which is the non-relativistic kinetic energy. Because relativity treats space and time as a whole, a relativistic generalization of this equation requires that space and time derivatives must enter symmetrically as they do in the Maxwell equations that govern the behavior of light — the equations must be differentially of the &quot;same order&quot; in space and time. In relativity, the momentum and the energies are the space and time parts of a spacetime vector, the four-momentum, and they are related by the relativistically invariant relation
formula_5

which says that the length of this four-vector is proportional to the rest mass . Substituting the operator equivalents of the energy and momentum from the Schrödinger theory produces the Klein–Gordon equation describing the propagation of waves, constructed from relativistically invariant objects,
formula_6
with the wave function formula_7 being a relativistic scalar: a complex number which has the same numerical value in all frames of reference. Space and time derivatives both enter to second order. This has a telling consequence for the interpretation of the equation. Because the equation is second order in the time derivative, one must specify initial values both of the wave function itself and of its first time-derivative in order to solve definite problems. Since both may be specified more or less arbitrarily, the wave function cannot maintain its former role of determining the probability density of finding the electron in a given state of motion. In the Schrödinger theory, the probability density is given by the positive definite expression
formula_8
and this density is convected according to the probability current vector
formula_9
with the conservation of probability current and density following from the continuity equation:
formula_10

The fact that the density is positive definite and convected according to this continuity equation implies that one may integrate the density over a certain domain and set the total to 1, and this condition will be maintained by the conservation law. A proper relativistic theory with a probability density current must also share this feature. To maintain the notion of a convected density, one must generalize the Schrödinger expression of the density and current so that space and time derivatives again enter symmetrically in relation to the scalar wave function. The Schrödinger expression can be kept for the current, but the probability density must be replaced by the symmetrically formed expression
formula_11
which now becomes the 4th component of a spacetime vector, and the entire probability 4-current density has the relativistically covariant expression
formula_12

The continuity equation is as before. Everything is compatible with relativity now, but the expression for the density is no longer positive definite; the initial values of both and may be freely chosen, and the density may thus become negative, something that is impossible for a legitimate probability density. Thus, one cannot get a simple generalization of the Schrödinger equation under the naive assumption that the wave function is a relativistic scalar, and the equation it satisfies, second order in time.

Although it is not a successful relativistic generalization of the Schrödinger equation, this equation is resurrected in the context of quantum field theory, where it is known as the Klein–Gordon equation, and describes a spinless particle field (e.g. pi meson or Higgs boson). Historically, Schrödinger himself arrived at this equation before the one that bears his name but soon discarded it. In the context of quantum field theory, the indefinite density is understood to correspond to the &quot;charge&quot; density, which can be positive or negative, and not the probability density.

=== Dirac&#x27;s coup ===
Dirac thus thought to try an equation that was &quot;first order&quot; in both space and time. He postulated an equation of the form
formula_13
where the operators formula_14 must be independent of formula_15 for linearity and independent of formula_16 for space-time homogeneity. These constraints implied additional dynamical variables that the formula_14 operators will depend upon; from this requirement Dirac concluded that the operators would depend upon 4x4 matrices, related to the Pauli matrices.

One could, for example, formally (i.e. by abuse of notation, since it is not straightforward to take a functional square root of the sum of two differential operators) take the relativistic expression for the energy
formula_18
replace by its operator equivalent, expand the square root in an infinite series of derivative operators, set up an eigenvalue problem, then solve the equation formally by iterations. Most physicists had little faith in such a process, even if it were technically possible.

As the story goes, Dirac was staring into the fireplace at Cambridge, pondering this problem, when he hit upon the idea of taking the square root of the wave operator (see also half derivative) thus:
formula_19

On multiplying out the right side it is apparent that, in order to get all the cross-terms such as to vanish, one must assume
formula_20
with
formula_21

Dirac, who had just then been intensely involved with working out the foundations of Heisenberg&#x27;s matrix mechanics, immediately understood that these conditions could be met if , , and are &quot;matrices&quot;, with the implication that the wave function has &quot;multiple components&quot;. This immediately explained the appearance of two-component wave functions in Pauli&#x27;s phenomenological theory of spin, something that up until then had been regarded as mysterious, even to Pauli himself. However, one needs at least matrices to set up a system with the properties required — so the wave function had &quot;four&quot; components, not two, as in the Pauli theory, or one, as in the bare Schrödinger theory. The four-component wave function represents a new class of mathematical object in physical theories that makes its first appearance here.

Given the factorization in terms of these matrices, one can now write down immediately an equation
formula_22
with formula_23 to be determined. Applying again the matrix operator on both sides yields
formula_24

Taking formula_25 shows that all the components of the wave function &quot;individually&quot; satisfy the relativistic energy–momentum relation. Thus the sought-for equation that is first-order in both space and time is
formula_26

Setting
formula_27
and because formula_28, the Dirac equation is produced as written above.

=== Covariant form and relativistic invariance ===
To demonstrate the relativistic invariance of the equation, it is advantageous to cast it into a form in which the space and time derivatives appear on an equal footing. New matrices are introduced as follows:
formula_29
and the equation takes the form (remembering the definition of the covariant components of the 4-gradient and especially that )

where there is an implied summation over the values of the twice-repeated index , and is the 4-gradient. In practice one often writes the gamma matrices in terms of 2 × 2 sub-matrices taken from the Pauli matrices and the 2 × 2 identity matrix. Explicitly the standard representation is
formula_30

The complete system is summarized using the Minkowski metric on spacetime in the form
formula_31
where the bracket expression
formula_32
denotes the anticommutator. These are the defining relations of a Clifford algebra over a pseudo-orthogonal 4-dimensional space with metric signature . The specific Clifford algebra employed in the Dirac equation is known today as the Dirac algebra. Although not recognized as such by Dirac at the time the equation was formulated, in hindsight the introduction of this &quot;geometric algebra&quot; represents an enormous stride forward in the development of quantum theory.

The Dirac equation may now be interpreted as an eigenvalue equation, where the rest mass is proportional to an eigenvalue of the 4-momentum operator, the proportionality constant being the speed of light:
formula_33

Using formula_34 (formula_35 is pronounced &quot;d-slash&quot;), according to Feynman slash notation, the Dirac equation becomes:
formula_36

In practice, physicists often use units of measure such that , known as natural units. The equation then takes the simple form

A foundational theorem states that if two distinct sets of matrices are given that both satisfy the Clifford relations, then they are connected to each other by a similarity transform:
formula_37

If in addition the matrices are all unitary, as are the Dirac set, then itself is unitary;
formula_38

The transformation is unique up to a multiplicative factor of absolute value 1. Let us now imagine a Lorentz transformation to have been performed on the space and time coordinates, and on the derivative operators, which form a covariant vector. For the operator to remain invariant, the gammas must transform among themselves as a contravariant vector with respect to their spacetime index. These new gammas will themselves satisfy the Clifford relations, because of the orthogonality of the Lorentz transformation. By the previously mentioned foundational theorem, one may replace the new set by the old set subject to a unitary transformation. In the new frame, remembering that the rest mass is a relativistic scalar, the Dirac equation will then take the form
formula_39

If the transformed spinor is defined as
formula_40
then the transformed Dirac equation is produced in a way that demonstrates manifest relativistic invariance:
formula_41

Thus, settling on any unitary representation of the gammas is final, provided the spinor is transformed according to the unitary transformation that corresponds to the given Lorentz transformation.

The various representations of the Dirac matrices employed will bring into focus particular aspects of the physical content in the Dirac wave function. The representation shown here is known as the &quot;standard&quot; representation – in it, the wave function&#x27;s upper two components go over into Pauli&#x27;s 2 spinor wave function in the limit of low energies and small velocities in comparison to light.

The considerations above reveal the origin of the gammas in &quot;geometry&quot;, hearkening back to Grassmann&#x27;s original motivation; they represent a fixed basis of unit vectors in spacetime. Similarly, products of the gammas such as represent &quot;oriented surface elements&quot;, and so on. With this in mind, one can find the form of the unit volume element on spacetime in terms of the gammas as follows. By definition, it is
formula_42

For this to be an invariant, the epsilon symbol must be a tensor, and so must contain a factor of , where is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since this is negative, that factor is &quot;imaginary&quot;. Thus
formula_43

This matrix is given the special symbol , owing to its importance when one is considering improper transformations of space-time, that is, those that change the orientation of the basis vectors. In the standard representation, it is
formula_44

This matrix will also be found to anticommute with the other four Dirac matrices:
formula_45

It takes a leading role when questions of &quot;parity&quot; arise because the volume element as a directed magnitude changes sign under a space-time reflection. Taking the positive square root above thus amounts to choosing a handedness convention on spacetime.

== Comparison with related theories ==

=== Pauli theory ===

The necessity of introducing half-integer spin goes back experimentally to the results of the Stern–Gerlach experiment. A beam of atoms is run through a strong inhomogeneous magnetic field, which then splits into parts depending on the intrinsic angular momentum of the atoms. It was found that for silver atoms, the beam was split in two; the ground state therefore could not be integer, because even if the intrinsic angular momentum of the atoms were as small as possible, 1, the beam would be split into three parts, corresponding to atoms with . The conclusion is that silver atoms have net intrinsic angular momentum of . Pauli set up a theory which explained this splitting by introducing a two-component wave function and a corresponding correction term in the Hamiltonian, representing a semi-classical coupling of this wave function to an applied magnetic field, as so in SI units: (Note that bold faced characters imply Euclidean vectors in 3 dimensions, whereas the Minkowski four-vector can be defined as formula_46)
formula_47

Here and formula_7 represent the components of the electromagnetic four-potential in their standard SI units, and the three sigmas are the Pauli matrices. On squaring out the first term, a residual interaction with the magnetic field is found, along with the usual classical Hamiltonian of a charged particle interacting with an applied field in SI units:
formula_49

This Hamiltonian is now a matrix, so the Schrödinger equation based on it must use a two-component wave function. On introducing the external electromagnetic 4-vector potential into the Dirac equation in a similar way, known as minimal coupling, it takes the form:
formula_50

A second application of the Dirac operator will now reproduce the Pauli term exactly as before, because the spatial Dirac matrices multiplied by , have the same squaring and commutation properties as the Pauli matrices. What is more, the value of the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron, standing in front of Pauli&#x27;s new term, is explained from first principles. This was a major achievement of the Dirac equation and gave physicists great faith in its overall correctness. There is more however. The Pauli theory may be seen as the low energy limit of the Dirac theory in the following manner. First the equation is written in the form of coupled equations for 2-spinors with the SI units restored:
formula_51
so
formula_52

Assuming the field is weak and the motion of the electron non-relativistic, the total energy of the electron is approximately equal to its rest energy, and the momentum going over to the classical value,
formula_53
and so the second equation may be written
formula_54

which is of order formula_55 Thus, at typical energies and velocities, the bottom components of the Dirac spinor in the standard representation are much suppressed in comparison to the top components. Substituting this expression into the first equation gives after some rearrangement
formula_56

The operator on the left represents the particle&#x27;s total energy reduced by its rest energy, which is just its classical kinetic energy, so one can recover Pauli&#x27;s theory upon identifying his 2-spinor with the top components of the Dirac spinor in the non-relativistic approximation. A further approximation gives the Schrödinger equation as the limit of the Pauli theory. Thus, the Schrödinger equation may be seen as the far non-relativistic approximation of the Dirac equation when one may neglect spin and work only at low energies and velocities. This also was a great triumph for the new equation, as it traced the mysterious that appears in it, and the necessity of a complex wave function, back to the geometry of spacetime through the Dirac algebra. It also highlights why the Schrödinger equation, although ostensibly in the form of a diffusion equation, actually represents wave propagation.

It should be strongly emphasized that the entire Dirac spinor represents an &quot;irreducible&quot; whole. The separation, done here, of the Dirac spinor into large and small components depends on the low-energy approximation being valid. The components that were neglected above, to show that the Pauli theory can be recovered by a low-velocity approximation of Dirac&#x27;s equation, are necessary to produce new phenomena observed in the relativistic regime – among them antimatter, and the creation and annihilation of particles.

=== Weyl theory ===
In the massless case formula_57, the Dirac equation reduces to the Weyl equation, which describes relativistic massless spin- particles.

The theory acquires a second formula_58 symmetry: see below.

== Physical interpretation ==
=== Identification of observables ===
The critical physical question in a quantum theory is this: what are the physically observable quantities defined by the theory? According to the postulates of quantum mechanics, such quantities are defined by self-adjoint operators that act on the Hilbert space of possible states of a system. The eigenvalues of these operators are then the possible results of measuring the corresponding physical quantity. In the Schrödinger theory, the simplest such object is the overall Hamiltonian, which represents the total energy of the system. To maintain this interpretation on passing to the Dirac theory, the Hamiltonian must be taken to be
formula_59
where, as always, there is an implied summation over the twice-repeated index . This looks promising, because one can see by inspection the rest energy of the particle and, in the case of , the energy of a charge placed in an electric potential . What about the term involving the vector potential? In classical electrodynamics, the energy of a charge moving in an applied potential is
formula_60

Thus, the Dirac Hamiltonian is fundamentally distinguished from its classical counterpart, and one must take great care to correctly identify what is observable in this theory. Much of the apparently paradoxical behavior implied by the Dirac equation amounts to a misidentification of these observables.

=== Hole theory ===
The negative solutions to the equation are problematic, for it was assumed that the particle has a positive energy. Mathematically speaking, however, there seems to be no reason for us to reject the negative-energy solutions. Since they exist, they cannot simply be ignored, for once the interaction between the electron and the electromagnetic field is included, any electron placed in a positive-energy eigenstate would decay into negative-energy eigenstates of successively lower energy. Real electrons obviously do not behave in this way, or they would disappear by emitting energy in the form of photons.

To cope with this problem, Dirac introduced the hypothesis, known as hole theory, that the vacuum is the many-body quantum state in which all the negative-energy electron eigenstates are occupied. This description of the vacuum as a &quot;sea&quot; of electrons is called the Dirac sea. Since the Pauli exclusion principle forbids electrons from occupying the same state, any additional electron would be forced to occupy a positive-energy eigenstate, and positive-energy electrons would be forbidden from decaying into negative-energy eigenstates.

Dirac further reasoned that if the negative-energy eigenstates are incompletely filled, each unoccupied eigenstate – called a hole – would behave like a positively charged particle. The hole possesses a &quot;positive&quot; energy because energy is required to create a particle–hole pair from the vacuum. As noted above, Dirac initially thought that the hole might be the proton, but Hermann Weyl pointed out that the hole should behave as if it had the same mass as an electron, whereas the proton is over 1800 times heavier. The hole was eventually identified as the positron, experimentally discovered by Carl Anderson in 1932.

It is not entirely satisfactory to describe the &quot;vacuum&quot; using an infinite sea of negative-energy electrons. The infinitely negative contributions from the sea of negative-energy electrons have to be canceled by an infinite positive &quot;bare&quot; energy and the contribution to the charge density and current coming from the sea of negative-energy electrons is exactly canceled by an infinite positive &quot;jellium&quot; background so that the net electric charge density of the vacuum is zero. In quantum field theory, a Bogoliubov transformation on the creation and annihilation operators (turning an occupied negative-energy electron state into an unoccupied positive energy positron state and an unoccupied negative-energy electron state into an occupied positive energy positron state) allows us to bypass the Dirac sea formalism even though, formally, it is equivalent to it.

In certain applications of condensed matter physics, however, the underlying concepts of &quot;hole theory&quot; are valid. The sea of conduction electrons in an electrical conductor, called a Fermi sea, contains electrons with energies up to the chemical potential of the system. An unfilled state in the Fermi sea behaves like a positively charged electron, and although it too is referred to as an &quot;electron hole&quot;, it is distinct from a positron. The negative charge of the Fermi sea is balanced by the positively charged ionic lattice of the material.

=== In quantum field theory ===

In quantum field theories such as quantum electrodynamics, the Dirac field is subject to a process of second quantization, which resolves some of the paradoxical features of the equation.

== Mathematical formulation ==

In its modern formulation for field theory, the Dirac equation is written in terms of a Dirac spinor field formula_61 taking values in a complex vector space described concretely as formula_62, defined on flat spacetime (Minkowski space) formula_63. Its expression also contains gamma matrices and a parameter formula_64 interpreted as the mass, as well as other physical constants. Dirac first obtained his equation through a factorization of Einstein&#x27;s energy-momentum-mass equivalence relation assuming a scalar product of momentum vectors determined by the metric tensor and quantized the resulting relation by associating momenta to their respective operators.

In terms of a field formula_65, the Dirac equation is then

and in natural units, with Feynman slash notation,

The gamma matrices are a set of four formula_66 complex matrices (elements of formula_67) which satisfy the defining &quot;anti&quot;-commutation relations:
formula_68
where formula_69 is the Minkowski metric element, and the indices formula_70 run over 0,1,2 and 3. These matrices can be realized explicitly under a choice of representation. Two common choices are the Dirac representation and the chiral representation. The Dirac representation is 
formula_71
where formula_72 are the Pauli matrices.

For the chiral representation the formula_73 are the same, but 
formula_74

The slash notation is a compact notation for
formula_75
where formula_76 is a four-vector (often it is the four-vector differential operator formula_77). The summation over the index formula_78 is implied.

Alternatively the four coupled linear first-order partial differential equations for the four quantities that make up the wave function can be written as a vector. In Planck units this becomes:
formula_79
which makes it clearer that it is a set of four partial differential equations with four unknown functions.
(Note that the term is not preceded by because is imaginary.)

=== Dirac adjoint and the adjoint equation ===
The Dirac adjoint of the spinor field formula_80 is defined as
formula_81
Using the property of gamma matrices (which follows straightforwardly from Hermicity properties of the formula_82) that
formula_83
one can derive the adjoint Dirac equation by taking the Hermitian conjugate of the Dirac equation and multiplying on the right by formula_84:
formula_85
where the partial derivative formula_86 acts from the right on formula_87: written in the usual way in terms of a left action of the derivative, we have
formula_88

=== Klein–Gordon equation ===
Applying formula_89 to the Dirac equation gives
formula_90
That is, each component of the Dirac spinor field satisfies the Klein–Gordon equation.

=== Conserved current ===
A conserved current of the theory is
formula_91
Another approach to derive this expression is by variational methods, applying Noether&#x27;s theorem for the global formula_58 symmetry to derive the conserved current formula_93

{\partial (\partial_\mu \bar\psi)}\delta\bar\psi\right) &lt;/math&gt;|}}
This immediately simplifies as there are no partial derivatives of formula_94 in the Lagrangian. formula_95 is the infinitesimal variation
formula_96
We evaluate
formula_97
The equation () finally is
formula_98

=== Solutions ===

Since the Dirac operator acts on 4-tuples of square-integrable functions, its solutions should be members of the same Hilbert space. The fact that the energies of the solutions do not have a lower bound is unexpected.

==== Plane-wave solutions ====
Plane-wave solutions are those arising from an ansatz
formula_99
which models a particle with definite 4-momentum formula_100 where formula_101

For this ansatz, the Dirac equation becomes an equation for formula_102:
formula_103
After picking a representation for the gamma matrices formula_82, solving this is a matter of solving a system of linear equations. It is a representation-free property of gamma matrices that the solution space is two-dimensional (see here).

For example, in the chiral representation for formula_82, the solution space is parametrised by a formula_106 vector formula_107, with
formula_108
where formula_109 and formula_110 is the Hermitian matrix square-root.

These plane-wave solutions provide a starting point for canonical quantization.

=== Lagrangian formulation ===
Both the Dirac equation and the Adjoint Dirac equation can be obtained from (varying) the action with a specific Lagrangian density that is given by:
formula_111

If one varies this with respect to formula_61 one gets the adjoint Dirac equation. Meanwhile, if one varies this with respect to formula_94 one gets the Dirac equation.

In natural units and with the slash notation, the action is then
For this action, the conserved current formula_114 above arises as the conserved current corresponding to the global formula_58 symmetry through Noether&#x27;s theorem for field theory. Gauging this field theory by changing the symmetry to a local, spacetime point dependent one gives gauge symmetry (really, gauge redundancy). The resultant theory is quantum electrodynamics or QED. See below for a more detailed discussion.

=== Lorentz invariance ===

The Dirac equation is invariant under Lorentz transformations, that is, under the action of the Lorentz group formula_116 or strictly formula_117, the component connected to the identity.

For a Dirac spinor viewed concretely as taking values in formula_62, the transformation under a Lorentz transformation formula_119 is given by a formula_120 complex matrix formula_121. There are some subtleties in defining the corresponding formula_121, as well as a standard abuse of notation.

Most treatments occur at the Lie algebra level. For a more detailed treatment see here. The Lorentz group of formula_66 &quot;real&quot; matrices acting on formula_63 is generated by a set of six matrices formula_125 with components
formula_126
When both the formula_127 indices are raised or lowered, these are simply the &#x27;standard basis&#x27; of antisymmetric matrices.

These satisfy the Lorentz algebra commutation relations
formula_128
In the article on the Dirac algebra, it is also found that the spin generators 
formula_129
satisfy the Lorentz algebra commutation relations.

A Lorentz transformation formula_119 can be written as
formula_131
where the components formula_132 are antisymmetric in formula_133.

The corresponding transformation on spin space is
formula_134
This is an abuse of notation, but a standard one. The reason is formula_121 is not a well-defined function of formula_119, since there are two different sets of components formula_132 (up to equivalence) which give the same formula_119 but different formula_121. In practice we implicitly pick one of these formula_132 and then formula_121 is well defined in terms of formula_142

Under a Lorentz transformation, the Dirac equation
formula_143
becomes
formula_144

Associated to Lorentz invariance is a conserved Noether current, or rather a tensor of conserved Noether currents formula_145. Similarly, since the equation is invariant under translations, there is a tensor of conserved Noether currents formula_146, which can be identified as the stress-energy tensor of the theory. The Lorentz current formula_145 can be written in terms of the stress-energy tensor in addition to a tensor representing internal angular momentum.

==== Further discussion of Lorentz covariance of the Dirac equation====
The Dirac equation is Lorentz covariant. Articulating this helps illuminate not only the Dirac equation, but also the Majorana spinor and Elko spinor, which although closely related, have subtle and important differences.

Understanding Lorentz covariance is simplified by keeping in mind the geometric character of the process. Let formula_148 be a single, fixed point in the spacetime manifold. Its location can be expressed in multiple coordinate systems. In the physics literature, these are written as formula_149 and formula_150, with the understanding that both formula_149 and formula_150 describe &quot;the same&quot; point formula_148, but in different local frames of reference (a frame of reference over a small extended patch of spacetime). 
One can imagine formula_148 as having a fiber of different coordinate frames above it. In geometric terms, one says that spacetime can be characterized as a fiber bundle, and specifically, the frame bundle. The difference between two points formula_149 and formula_150 in the same fiber is a combination of rotations and Lorentz boosts. A choice of coordinate frame is a (local) section through that bundle.

Coupled to the frame bundle is a second bundle, the spinor bundle. A section through the spinor bundle is just the particle field (the Dirac spinor, in the present case). Different points in the spinor fiber correspond to the same physical object (the fermion) but expressed in different Lorentz frames. Clearly, the frame bundle and the spinor bundle must be tied together in a consistent fashion to get consistent results; formally, one says that the spinor bundle is the associated bundle; it is associated to a principal bundle, which in the present case is the frame bundle. Differences between points on the fiber correspond to the symmetries of the system. The spinor bundle has two distinct generators of its symmetries: the total angular momentum and the intrinsic angular momentum. Both correspond to Lorentz transformations, but in different ways.

The presentation here follows that of Itzykson and Zuber. It is very nearly identical to that of Bjorken and Drell. A similar derivation in a general relativistic setting can be found in Weinberg. Here we fix our spacetime to be flat, that is, our spacetime is Minkowski space.

Under a Lorentz transformation formula_157 the Dirac spinor to transform as
formula_158
It can be shown that an explicit expression for formula_159 is given by
formula_160
where formula_161 parameterizes the Lorentz transformation, and formula_162 are the six 4×4 matrices satisfying:
formula_163

This matrix can be interpreted as the intrinsic angular momentum of the Dirac field. That it deserves this interpretation arises by contrasting it to the generator formula_164 of Lorentz transformations, having the form
formula_165
This can be interpreted as the total angular momentum. It acts on the spinor field as
formula_166
Note the formula_149 above does &quot;not&quot; have a prime on it: the above is obtained by transforming formula_168 obtaining the change to formula_169 and then returning to the original coordinate system formula_170.

The geometrical interpretation of the above is that the frame field is affine, having no preferred origin. The generator formula_164 generates the symmetries of this space: it provides a relabelling of a fixed point formula_172 The generator formula_162 generates a movement from one point in the fiber to another: a movement from formula_168 with both formula_149 and formula_150 still corresponding to the same spacetime point formula_177 These perhaps obtuse remarks can be elucidated with explicit algebra.

Let formula_178 be a Lorentz transformation. The Dirac equation is
formula_179
If the Dirac equation is to be covariant, then it should have exactly the same form in all Lorentz frames:
formula_180
The two spinors formula_61 and formula_182 should both describe the same physical field, and so should be related by a transformation that does not change any physical observables (charge, current, mass, &quot;etc.&quot;) The transformation should encode only the change of coordinate frame. It can be shown that such a transformation is a 4×4 unitary matrix. Thus, one may presume that the relation between the two frames can be written as
formula_183
Inserting this into the transformed equation, the result is
formula_184
The coordinates related by Lorentz transformation satisfy: 
formula_185
The original Dirac equation is then regained if
formula_186
An explicit expression for formula_187 (equal to the expression given above) can be obtained by considering a Lorentz transformation of infinitesimal rotation near the identity transformation:
formula_188 
where formula_189 is the metric tensor : formula_190 and is symmetric while formula_191 is antisymmetric. After plugging and chugging, one obtains
formula_192
which is the (infinitesimal) form for formula_159 above and yields the relation formula_194 . To obtain the affine relabelling, write
formula_195

After properly antisymmetrizing, one obtains the generator of symmetries formula_164 given earlier. Thus, both formula_164 and formula_162 can be said to be the &quot;generators of Lorentz transformations&quot;, but with a subtle distinction: the first corresponds to a relabelling of points on the affine frame bundle, which forces a translation along the fiber of the spinor on the spin bundle, while the second corresponds to translations along the fiber of the spin bundle (taken as a movement formula_168 along the frame bundle, as well as a movement formula_200 along the fiber of the spin bundle.) Weinberg provides additional arguments for the physical interpretation of these as total and intrinsic angular momentum.

== Other formulations ==
The Dirac equation can be formulated in a number of other ways.

=== Curved spacetime ===

This article has developed the Dirac equation in flat spacetime according to special relativity. It is possible to formulate the Dirac equation in curved spacetime.

=== The algebra of physical space ===

This article developed the Dirac equation using four-vectors and Schrödinger operators. The Dirac equation in the algebra of physical space uses a Clifford algebra over the real numbers, a type of geometric algebra.

=== Coupled Weyl Spinors ===

As mentioned above, the &quot;massless&quot; Dirac equation immediately reduces to the homogeneous Weyl equation. By using the chiral representation of the gamma matrices, the nonzero-mass equation can also be decomposed into a pair of &quot;coupled&quot; inhomogeneous Weyl equations acting on the first and last pairs of indices of the original four-component spinor, i.e. formula_201, where formula_202 and formula_203 are each two-component Weyl spinors. This is because the skew block form of the chiral gamma matrices means that they swap the formula_202 and formula_203 and apply the two-by-two Pauli matrices to each:

formula_206.

So the Dirac equation

formula_207

becomes

formula_208

which in turn is equivalent to a pair of inhomogeneous Weyl equations for massless left- and right-helicity spinors, where the coupling strength is proportional to the mass:

formula_209

formula_210.

This has been proposed as an intuitive explanation of Zitterbewegung, as these massless components would propagate at the speed of light and move in opposite directions, since the helicity is the projection of the spin onto the direction of motion. Here the role of the &quot;mass&quot; formula_211 is not to make the velocity less than the speed of light, but instead controls the average rate at which these reversals occur; specifically, the reversals can be modeled as a Poisson process.

== U(1) symmetry ==
Natural units are used in this section. The coupling constant is labelled by convention with formula_212: this parameter can also be viewed as modelling the electron charge.

=== Vector symmetry ===
The Dirac equation and action admits a formula_58 symmetry where the fields formula_214 transform as
formula_215
This is a global symmetry, known as the formula_58 vector symmetry (as opposed to the formula_58 axial symmetry: see below). By Noether&#x27;s theorem there is a corresponding conserved current: this has been mentioned previously as
formula_218

=== Gauging the symmetry ===

If we &#x27;promote&#x27; the global symmetry, parametrised by the constant formula_219, to a local symmetry, parametrised by a function formula_220, or equivalently formula_221 the Dirac equation is no longer invariant: there is a residual derivative of formula_222.

The fix proceeds as in scalar electrodynamics: the partial derivative is promoted to a covariant derivative formula_223
formula_224
formula_225
The covariant derivative depends on the field being acted on. The newly introduced formula_226 is the 4-vector potential from electrodynamics, but also can be viewed as a formula_58 gauge field (which, mathematically, is defined as a formula_58 connection).

The transformation law under gauge transformations for formula_226 is then the usual
formula_230
but can also be derived by asking that covariant derivatives transform under a gauge transformation as
formula_231
formula_232
We then obtain a gauge-invariant Dirac action by promoting the partial derivative to a covariant one:
formula_233
The final step needed to write down a gauge-invariant Lagrangian is to add a Maxwell Lagrangian term,
formula_234
Putting these together gives
 = \int d^4x\,\left[-\frac{1}{4}F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu} + \bar\psi\,(iD\!\!\!\!\big / - m)\,\psi\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|border
|border colour =#50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4
Expanding out the covariant derivative allows the action to be written in a second useful form:
formula_235

=== Axial symmetry ===
Massless Dirac fermions, that is, fields formula_80 satisfying the Dirac equation with formula_57, admit a second, inequivalent formula_58 symmetry.

This is seen most easily by writing the four-component Dirac fermion formula_80 as a pair of two-component vector fields,
formula_240
and adopting the chiral representation for the gamma matrices, so that formula_241 may be written
formula_242
where formula_243 has components formula_244 and formula_245 has components formula_246.

The Dirac action then takes the form
formula_247
That is, it decouples into a theory of two Weyl spinors or Weyl fermions.

The earlier vector symmetry is still present, where formula_248 and formula_249 rotate identically. This form of the action makes the second inequivalent formula_58 symmetry manifest:
formula_251
This can also be expressed at the level of the Dirac fermion as 
formula_252
where formula_253 is the exponential map for matrices.

This isn&#x27;t the only formula_58 symmetry possible, but it is conventional. Any &#x27;linear combination&#x27; of the vector and axial symmetries is also a formula_58 symmetry.

Classically, the axial symmetry admits a well-formulated gauge theory. But at the quantum level, there is an anomaly, that is, an obstruction to gauging.

=== Extension to color symmetry ===

We can extend this discussion from an abelian formula_58 symmetry to a general non-abelian symmetry under a gauge group formula_257, the group of color symmetries for a theory.

For concreteness, we fix formula_258, the special unitary group of matrices acting on formula_259.

Before this section, formula_80 could be viewed as a spinor field on Minkowski space, in other words a function formula_261, and its components in formula_62 are labelled by spin indices, conventionally Greek indices taken from the start of the alphabet formula_263.

Promoting the theory to a gauge theory, informally formula_61 acquires a part transforming like formula_259, and these are labelled by color indices, conventionally Latin indices formula_266. In total, formula_80 has formula_268 components, given in indices by formula_269. The &#x27;spinor&#x27; labels only how the field transforms under spacetime transformations.

Formally, formula_80 is valued in a tensor product, that is, it is a function formula_271

Gauging proceeds similarly to the abelian formula_58 case, with a few differences. Under a gauge transformation formula_273 the spinor fields transform as
formula_274
formula_275
The matrix-valued gauge field formula_226 or formula_277 connection transforms as
formula_278
and the covariant derivatives defined 
formula_279
formula_280
transform as 
formula_281
formula_282

Writing down a gauge-invariant action proceeds exactly as with the formula_58 case, replacing the Maxwell Lagrangian with the Yang–Mills Lagrangian
formula_284
where the Yang–Mills field strength or curvature is defined here as
formula_285
and formula_286 is the matrix commutator.

The action is then
 = \int d^4x\,\left[-\frac{1}{4}\text{Tr}(F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}) + \bar\psi\,(iD\!\!\!\!\big / - m)\,\psi\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|border
|border colour =#50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4

==== Physical applications ====
For physical applications, the case formula_287 describes the quark sector of the Standard Model which models strong interactions. Quarks are modelled as Dirac spinors; the gauge field is the gluon field. The case formula_288 describes part of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. Leptons such as electrons and neutrinos are the Dirac spinors; the gauge field is the formula_289 gauge boson.

==== Generalisations ====
This expression can be generalised to arbitrary Lie group formula_257 with connection formula_226 and a representation formula_292, where the colour part of formula_61 is valued in formula_294. Formally, the Dirac field is a function formula_295

Then formula_61 transforms under a gauge transformation formula_297 as
formula_298
and the covariant derivative is defined
formula_299
where here we view formula_300 as a Lie algebra representation of the Lie algebra formula_301 associated to formula_257.

This theory can be generalised to curved spacetime, but there are subtleties which arise in gauge theory on a general spacetime (or more generally still, a manifold) which, on flat spacetime, can be ignored. This is ultimately due to the contractibility of flat spacetime which allows us to view a gauge field and gauge transformations as defined globally on formula_63.

<doc id="39411" wikidata="Q267602" url="?curid=39411" title="XYY syndrome">
<text>XYY syndrome, also known as Jacobs syndrome, is an aneuploid genetic condition in which a male has an extra Y chromosome. There are usually few symptoms. These may include being taller than average and an increased risk of learning disabilities. The person is generally otherwise normal, including typical rates of fertility.
The condition is generally not inherited but rather occurs as a result of a random event during sperm development. Diagnosis is by a chromosomal analysis, but most of those affected are not diagnosed within their lifetime. There are 47 chromosomes, instead of the usual 46, giving a 47,XYY karyotype.
Treatment may include speech therapy or extra help with schoolwork, however outcomes are generally positive. The condition occurs in about 1 in 1,000 male births. Many people with the condition are unaware that they have it. The condition was first described in 1961.

==Signs and symptoms==

===Physical traits===
People with the 47,XYY karyotype have an increased growth rate from early childhood, with an average final height approximately above expected final height. In Edinburgh, Scotland, eight 47,XYY boys born 1967–1972 and identified in a newborn screening programme had an average height of at age 18—their fathers&#x27; average height was , their mothers&#x27; average height was . The increased gene dosage of three X/Y chromosome pseudoautosomal region (PAR1) SHOX genes has been postulated as a cause of the increased stature seen in all three sex chromosome trisomies: 47,XXX, 47,XXY, and 47,XYY.
Severe acne was noted in a very few early case reports, but dermatologists specializing in acne now doubt the existence of a relationship with 47,XYY.

Prenatal testosterone levels are normal in 47,XYY males. Most 47,XYY males have normal sexual development and have normal fertility.

=== Cognitive and behavioral traits ===
In contrast to the other common sex chromosome aneuploidies—47,XXX and 47,XXY (Klinefelter syndrome)—the average of the IQ scores of 47,XYY boys identified by newborn screening programs was not reduced compared to the general population. In a summary of six prospective studies of 47,XYY boys identified by newborn screening programmes, twenty-eight 47,XYY boys had an average 100.76 verbal IQ, 108.79 performance IQ, and 105.00 full-scale IQ. In a systematic review including two prospective studies of 47,XYY boys identified by newborn screening programs and one retrospective study of 47,XYY men identified by screening men over in height, forty-two 47,XYY boys and men had an average 99.5 verbal IQ and 106.4 performance IQ.

In prospective studies of 47,XYY boys identified by newborn screening programs, the IQ scores of 47,XYY boys were usually slightly lower than those of their siblings. In Edinburgh, fifteen 47,XYY boys with siblings identified in a newborn screening program had an average 104.0 verbal IQ and 106.7 performance IQ, while their siblings had an average 112.9 verbal IQ and 114.6 performance IQ.

Approximately half of 47,XYY boys identified by newborn screening programs had learning difficulties—a higher proportion than found among siblings and above-average-IQ control groups. In Edinburgh, 54% of 47,XYY boys (7 of 13) identified in a newborn screening program received remedial reading teaching compared to 18% (4 of 22) in an above-average-IQ control group of 46,XY boys matched by their father&#x27;s social class. In Boston, USA 55% of 47,XYY boys (6 of 11) identified in a newborn screening program had learning difficulties and received part-time resource room help compared to 11% (1 of 9) in an above-average-IQ control group of 46,XY boys with familial balanced autosomal chromosome translocations.

Developmental delays and behavioral problems are also found, but these characteristics vary widely among affected boys and men, are not unique to 47,XYY and are managed no differently from in 46,XY males. Aggression is not seen more frequently in 47,XYY males.

Patients with Jacobs syndrome have been shown to have a higher risk of developing certain diseases such as asthma, seizure problems, and tremors. Some 47,XYY patients have been found to have genitourinary malformations. These include cryptorchidism, hypoplastic scrotum, microphallus, and hypospadias. These men could be diagnosed with infertility as a result of oligospermia or sperm chromosomal abnormalities. According to certain psychological studies, people with XYY syndrome may have problems with impulse control and emotional regulation. Increased testosterone levels were found to be correlated with an increased risk of aggressive behavior in incarcerated males with 47,XYY syndrome. 47,XYY is not inherited; it usually occurs as a random event during the formation of sperm cells. An incident in chromosome separation during anaphase II (of meiosis II) called nondisjunction can result in sperm cells with an extra copy of the Y-chromosome. If one of these atypical sperm cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra Y-chromosome in each of the body&#x27;s cells.

In some cases, the extra Y-chromosome results from nondisjunction during mitosis in early embryonic development. This can produce 46,XY/47,XYY mosaics.

==Diagnosis==
47,XYY syndrome is not usually diagnosed until learning issues are present. The syndrome is diagnosed in an increasing number of children prenatally by amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling in order to obtain a chromosome karyotype, where the abnormality can be observed.

It is estimated that only 15–20% of children with 47,XYY syndrome are ever diagnosed. Of these, approximately 30% are diagnosed prenatally. For the rest of those diagnosed after birth, around half are diagnosed during childhood or adolescence after developmental delays are observed. The rest are diagnosed after any of a variety of symptoms, including fertility problems (5%) have been seen.

==Epidemiology==
Around 1 in 1,000 boys are born with a 47,XYY karyotype. The incidence of 47,XYY is not known to be affected by the parents&#x27; ages.

==History==

===1960s===
In April 1956, &quot;Hereditas&quot; published the discovery by cytogeneticists Joe Hin Tjio and Albert Levan at Lund University in Sweden that the normal number of chromosomes in diploid human cells was 46—not 48, as had been believed for the preceding thirty years. In the wake of the establishment of the normal number of human chromosomes, 47,XYY was the last of the common sex chromosome aneuploidies to be discovered, two years after the discoveries of 47,XXY, 45,X and 47,XXX in 1959. Even the much less common 48,XXYY had been discovered in 1960, a year before 47,XYY.

Screening for those X chromosome aneuploidies was possible before the advent of human chromosome analysis by noting the presence or absence of &quot;female&quot; sex chromatin bodies (Barr bodies) in the nuclei of interphase cells in buccal smears, a technique developed a decade &quot;before&quot; the first reported sex chromosome aneuploidy. An analogous technique to screen for Y-chromosome aneuploidies by noting supernumerary &quot;male&quot; sex chromatin bodies was not developed until 1970, a decade &quot;after&quot; the first reported male sex chromosome aneuploidy.

The first published report of a man with a 47,XYY karyotype was by the American cytogeneticist Avery Sandberg and his colleagues at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center (then known as Roswell Park Memorial Institute) in Buffalo, New York in 1961. It was an incidental finding in a normal 44-year-old, 6 ft. [183 cm] tall man of average intelligence who was karyotyped because he had a daughter with Down syndrome. Only a dozen isolated 47,XYY cases were reported in the medical literature in the four years following the first report by Sandberg.

The XYY syndrome, if named after the discoverer, should rightly be termed Sandberg syndrome and not Jacobs syndrome although the British cytogeneticist Patricia Jacobs did indeed contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of XYY. In December 1965 and March 1966, &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;The Lancet&quot; published the first preliminary reports by Jacobs and her colleagues at the MRC Human Genetics Unit at Western General Hospital in Edinburgh of a chromosome survey of 315 male patients at State Hospital in Carstairs, Lanarkshire—Scotland&#x27;s only special security hospital for developmentally disabled people —that found nine patients, ages 17 to 36, averaging almost 6 ft. in height (avg. 5&#x27;11&quot;, range: 5&#x27;7&quot; to 6&#x27;2&quot;), had a 47,XYY karyotype, and mischaracterized them as aggressive and violent criminals. Over the next decade, almost all published XYY studies were on height-selected, institutionalized XYY males.

In January 1968 and March 1968, &quot;The Lancet&quot; and &quot;Science&quot; published the first U.S. reports of tall, institutionalized XYY males by Mary Telfer, a biochemist, and colleagues at the Elwyn Institute. Telfer found five tall, developmentally disabled XYY boys and men in hospitals and penal institutions in Pennsylvania, and since four of the five had at least moderate facial acne, reached the erroneous conclusion that acne was a defining characteristic of XYY males. After learning that convicted mass murderer Richard Speck had been karyotyped, Telfer not only incorrectly assumed the acne-scarred Speck was XYY, but reached the false conclusion that Speck was the archetypical XYY male—or &quot;supermale&quot; as Telfer referred to XYY males outside of peer-reviewed scientific journals.

In April 1968, &quot;The New York Times&quot;—using Telfer as a main source—introduced the XYY genetic condition to the general public in a three-part series on consecutive days that began with a Sunday front-page story about the planned use of the condition as a mitigating factor in two murder trials in Paris and Melbourne—and falsely reported that Richard Speck was an XYY male and that the condition would be used in an appeal of his murder conviction. The series was echoed the following week by articles—again using Telfer as a main source—in &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and six months later in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;.

In December 1968, the &quot;Journal of Medical Genetics&quot; published the first XYY review article—by Willam Michael Court Brown (1918–1969), director of the MRC Human Genetics Unit—which reported that he had found no overrepresentation of XYY males in nationwide chromosome surveys of prisons and hospitals for developmentally disabled and mentally ill people in Scotland, and concluded that studies confined to institutionalized XYY males may be guilty of selection bias, and that long-term longitudinal prospective studies of newborn XYY boys were needed.

In May 1969, at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association, Telfer and her Elwyn Institute colleagues reported that case studies of the institutionalized XYY and XXY males they had found convinced them that XYY males had been falsely stigmatized and that their behavior may not be significantly different from chromosomally normal 46,XY males.

In June 1969, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Center for Studies of Crime and Delinquency held a two-day XYY conference in Chevy Chase, Maryland. In December 1969, with a grant from the NIMH Center for Studies of Crime and Delinquency, cytogeneticist Digamber Borgaonkar at Johns Hopkins Hospital began a chromosome survey of (predominantly African-American) boys ages 8 to 18 in all Maryland institutions for delinquent, neglected, or mentally ill juveniles, which was suspended from February–May 1970 due to an American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) lawsuit regarding the study&#x27;s lack of informed consent.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, screening of consecutive newborns for sex chromosome abnormalities was undertaken at seven centers worldwide: in Denver (Jan 1964–1974), Edinburgh (Apr 1967–Jun 1979), New Haven (Oct 1967–Sep 1968), Toronto (Oct 1967–Sep 1971), Aarhus (Oct 1969–Jan 1974, Oct 1980–Jan 1989), Winnipeg (Feb 1970–Sep 1973), and Boston (Apr 1970–Nov 1974). The Boston study, led by Harvard Medical School child psychiatrist Stanley Walzer at Children&#x27;s Hospital, was unique among the seven newborn screening studies in that it only screened newborn &quot;boys&quot; (non-private-ward newborn boys at the Boston Hospital for Women) and was funded in part by grants from the NIMH Center for Studies of Crime and Delinquency. The Edinburgh study was led by Shirley Ratcliffe who focused her career on it and published the results in 1999.

===1970s===
In December 1969, Lore Zech at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm first reported intense fluorescence of the A T-rich distal half of the long arm of the Y chromosome in the nuclei of metaphase cells treated with quinacrine mustard. In April 1970, Peter Pearson and Martin Bobrow at the MRC Population Genetics Unit in Oxford and Canino Vosa at the University of Oxford reported fluorescent &quot;male&quot; sex chromatin bodies in the nuclei of interphase cells in buccal smears treated with quinacrine dihydrochloride, which could be used to screen for Y chromosome aneuploidies like 47,XYY.

In December 1970, at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), its retiring president, geneticist H. Bentley Glass, cheered by the legalization of abortion in New York, envisioned a future where pregnant women would be required by the government to abort XYY &quot;sex deviants&quot;. Mischaracterization of the XYY genetic condition was quickly incorporated into high school biology textbooks and medical school psychiatry textbooks, where misinformation still persists decades later.

In 1973, child psychiatrist Herbert Schreier at Children&#x27;s Hospital told Harvard Medical School microbiologist Jon Beckwith of Science for the People that he thought Walzer&#x27;s Boston XYY study was unethical; Science for the People investigated the study and, regarding the study, filed an ethics complaint with Harvard Medical School in March 1974. In November 1974, Science for the People went public with their objections to the Boston XYY study in a press conference and a &quot;New Scientist&quot; article alleging inadequate informed consent, a lack of benefit (since no specific treatment was available) but substantial risk (by stigmatization with a false stereotype) to the subjects, and that the unblinded experimental design could not produce meaningful results regarding the subjects&#x27; behavior. In December 1974, the Harvard Standing Committee on Medical Research issued a report supporting the Boston XYY study, and in March 1975, the faculty voted 199–35 to allow continuation of the study. After April 1975, screening of newborns was discontinued—changes to informed consent procedures and pressure from additional advocacy groups, including the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund, having led to the discontinuation of the last active U.S. newborn screening programs for sex chromosome abnormalities in Boston and Denver.

In a paper published in &quot;New Scientist&quot; on November 14, 1974 entitled &quot;XYY syndrome: a dangerous myth&quot; found no link was found between having an extra Y chromosome and violent behavior. According to the paper, adolescents found to have an extra Y chromosome in a Maryland institution were chemically sterilized to attempt to maintain &quot;normal behavior,&quot; despite this the paper found no major behavioral differences between XY and XYY individuals.

In August 1976, &quot;Science&quot; published a retrospective cohort study by Educational Testing Service psychologist Herman Witkin and colleagues that screened the tallest 16% of men (over 184 cm (6&#x27;0&quot;) in height) born in Copenhagen from 1944 to 1947 for XXY and XYY karyotypes, and found an increased rate of minor criminal convictions for property crimes among sixteen XXY and twelve XYY men may be related to the lower intelligence of those with criminal convictions, but found no evidence that XXY or XYY men were inclined to be aggressive or violent.

===1980s and later===
The March of Dimes sponsored five international conferences in June 1974, November 1977, May 1981, June 1984, and June 1989 and published articles from the conferences in book form in 1979, 1982, 1986, and 1991 from seven longitudinal prospective cohort studies on the development of over 300 children and young adults with sex chromosome abnormalities identified in the screening of almost 200,000 consecutive births in hospitals in Denver, Edinburgh, New Haven, Toronto, Aarhus, Winnipeg, and Boston from 1964 to 1975. These seven studies—the only unbiased studies of unselected individuals with sex chromosome abnormalities—have replaced the older, biased studies of institutionalized individuals in understanding the development of individuals with sex chromosome abnormalities.

In May 1997, &quot;Nature Genetics&quot; published the discovery by Ercole Rao and colleagues of the X/Y chromosome pseudoautosomal region (PAR1) SHOX gene, haploinsufficiency of which leads to short stature in Turner syndrome (45,X). It was subsequently postulated that the increased gene dosage of three SHOX genes leads to tall stature in the sex chromosome trisomies 47,XXX, 47,XXY, and 47,XYY.

In July 1999, &quot;Psychological Medicine&quot; published a case-control study by Royal Edinburgh Hospital psychiatrist Michael Götz and colleagues that found an increased rate of criminal convictions among seventeen XYY men identified in the Edinburgh newborn screening study compared to an above-average-IQ control group of sixty XY men, which multiple logistic regression analysis indicated was mediated mainly through lowered intelligence.

In June 2002, the &quot;American Journal of Medical Genetics&quot; published results from a longitudinal prospective cohort Denver Family Development Study led by pediatrician and geneticist Arthur Robinson, which found that in fourteen prenatally diagnosed 47,XYY boys (from high socioeconomic status families), IQ scores available for six boys ranged from 100 to 147 with a mean of 120. For the eleven of fourteen boys with siblings, in nine instances their siblings were stronger academically, but in one case the subject was performing equal to, and in another case superior to, his siblings.

==Society and culture==
Some medical geneticists question whether the term &quot;syndrome&quot; is appropriate for this condition because many people with this karyotype appear normal.

=== In popular culture ===

In June 1970, &quot;The XYY Man&quot; was published—the first of seven Kenneth Royce spy novels whose fictional tall, intelligent, nonviolent XYY hero was a reformed expert cat burglar recruited by British intelligence for dangerous assignments—and later adapted into a thirteen-episode British summer television series broadcast in 1976 and 1977.

In other fictional television works, a January 1971 episode &quot;By the Pricking of My Thumbs ...&quot; of the British science fiction TV series &quot;Doomwatch&quot; featured an XYY boy expelled from school because his genetic condition led him to be falsely accused of nearly blinding another boy. A November 1993 episode of the American police procedural TV series &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Born Bad&quot;, portrays a 14-year-old XYY sociopathic murderer. The May 2007 season finale episode, &quot;Born To Kill&quot;, of the American police procedural TV series &quot;&quot; depicts a 34-year-old XYY serial killer.

The false stereotype of XYY boys and men as violent criminals has also been used as a plot device in the horror films &quot;Il gatto a nove code&quot; in February 1971 (dubbed into English as &quot;The Cat o&#x27; Nine Tails&quot; in May 1971) and &quot;Alien 3&quot; in May 1992. The main character of the 2005 film &quot;Neo Ned&quot; is a neo-nazi who has an extra Y chromosome.

<text>In social choice theory and politics, a spoiler effect happens when a losing candidate affects the results of an election simply by participating. Voting rules that are not affected by spoilers are said to be spoilerproof.

The frequency and severity of spoiler effects depends substantially on the voting method. Instant-runoff or ranked-choice voting (RCV), the two-round system (TRS), and especially first-past-the-post (FPP) without winnowing or primary elections are highly sensitive to spoilers (though RCV and TRS less so in some circumstances), and all three rules are affected by center-squeeze and vote splitting. Majority-rule (or Condorcet) methods are only rarely affected by spoilers, which are limited to rare situations called cyclic ties. Rated voting systems are not subject to Arrow&#x27;s theorem. Whether such methods are spoilerproof depends on the nature of the rating scales the voters use to express their opinions.

Spoiler effects can also occur in some methods of proportional representation, such as the single transferable vote (STV or RCV-PR) and the largest remainders method of party-list representation, where it is called a new party paradox. A new party entering an election causes some seats to shift from one unrelated party to another, even if the new party wins no seats. This kind of spoiler effect is avoided by divisor methods and proportional approval.

== Motivation ==
In decision theory, &quot;independence of irrelevant alternatives&quot; is a fundamental principle of rational choice which says that a decision between two outcomes, A or B, should not depend on the quality of a third, unrelated outcome C. A famous joke by Sidney Morgenbesser illustrates this principle:A man is deciding whether to order apple, blueberry, or cherry pie before settling on apple. The waitress informs him that the cherry pie is very good and a favorite of most customers. The man replies &quot;in that case, I&#x27;ll have the blueberry.&quot;Politicians and social choice theorists have long argued for the unfairness of spoiler effects. The mathematician and political economist Nicolas de Condorcet was the first to study the spoiler effect, in the 1780s.

=== Manipulation by politicians ===
Voting systems that violate independence of irrelevant alternatives are susceptible to being manipulated by &quot;strategic nomination&quot;. Such systems may produce an &quot;incentive to entry&quot;, increasing a candidate&#x27;s chances of winning if similar candidates join the race, or an &quot;incentive to exit&quot;, reducing the candidate&#x27;s chances of winning.

Some systems are particularly infamous for their ease of manipulation, such as the Borda count, which exhibits a particularly severe entry incentive, letting any party &quot;clone their way to victory&quot; by running a large number of candidates. This famously forced de Borda to concede that &quot;my system is meant only for honest men,&quot; and eventually led to its abandonment by the French Academy of Sciences.

Other systems exhibit an exit incentive. The vote splitting effect in plurality voting demonstrates this method&#x27;s strong exit incentive: if multiple candidates with similar views run in an election, their supporters&#x27; votes will be diluted, which may cause a unified opposition candidate to win despite having less support. This effect encourages groups of similar candidates to form an organization to make sure they don&#x27;t step on each other&#x27;s toes.

== By electoral system ==
Different electoral systems have different levels of vulnerability to spoilers. In general, spoilers are common with plurality voting, somewhat common in plurality-runoff methods, rare with majoritarian methods, and with a varying level of spoiler vulnerability with most rated voting methods.

=== First-preference plurality ===
In cases where there are many similar candidates, spoiler effects occur most often in first-preference plurality (FPP). For example, in the United States, vote splitting is common in primaries, where many similar candidates run against each other. The purpose of a primary election is to eliminate vote splitting among candidates from the same party in the general election by running only one candidate. In a two-party system, party primaries effectively turn FPP into a two-round system.

Vote splitting is the most common cause of spoiler effects in FPP. In these systems, the presence of many ideologically-similar candidates causes their vote total to be split between them, placing these candidates at a disadvantage. This is most visible in elections where a minor candidate draws votes away from a major candidate with similar politics, thereby causing a strong opponent of both to win.

=== Runoff systems ===
Plurality-runoff methods like the two-round system and RCV still experience vote-splitting in each round. This produces a kind of spoiler effect called a center squeeze. Compared to plurality without primaries, the elimination of weak candidates in earlier rounds reduces their effect on the final results; however, spoiled elections remain common compared to other systems. As a result, instant-runoff voting still tends towards two-party rule through the process known as Duverger&#x27;s law. A notable example of this can be seen in Alaska&#x27;s 2024 race, where party elites pressured candidate Nancy Dahlstrom into dropping out to avoid a repeat of the spoiled 2022 election.

=== Tournament (Condorcet) voting ===
Spoiler effects rarely occur when using tournament solutions, where candidates are compared in one-on-one matchups to determine relative preference. For each pair of candidates, there is a count for how many voters prefer the first candidate in the pair to the second candidate. The resulting table of pairwise counts eliminates the step-by-step redistribution of votes, which is usually the cause for spoilers in other methods. This pairwise comparison means that spoilers can only occur when there is a Condorcet cycle, where there is no single candidate preferred to all others.

Theoretical models suggest that somewhere between 90% and 99% of real-world elections have a Condorcet winner, and the first Condorcet cycle in a ranked American election was found in 2021. Some systems like the Schulze method and ranked pairs have stronger spoiler resistance guarantees that limit which candidates can spoil an election without a Condorcet winner.

=== Rated voting ===
Rated voting methods ask voters to assign each candidate a score on a scale (e.g. rating them from 0 to 10), instead of listing them from first to last. Highest median and score (highest mean) voting are the two most prominent examples of rated voting rules. Whenever voters rate candidates independently, the rating given to one candidate does not affect the ratings given to the other candidates. Any new candidate cannot change the winner of the race without becoming the winner themselves, which would disqualify them from the definition of a spoiler. For this to hold, in some elections, some voters must use less than their full voting power despite having meaningful preferences among viable candidates.

The outcome of rated voting depends on the scale used by the voter or assumed by the mechanism. If the voters use relative scales, i.e. scales that depend on what candidates are running, then the outcome can change if candidates who don&#x27;t win drop out. Empirical results from panel data suggest that judgments are at least in part relative. Thus, rated methods, as used in practice, may exhibit a spoiler effect caused by the interaction between the voters and the system, even if the system itself passes IIA given an absolute scale.

=== Proportional representation ===
Spoiler effects can also occur in some methods of proportional representation, such as the single transferable vote (STV or RCV-PR) and the largest remainders method of party-list representation, where it is called a new party paradox. A new party entering an election causes some seats to shift from one unrelated party to another, even if the new party wins no seats. This kind of spoiler effect is avoided by divisor methods and proportional approval.

== Spoiler campaign ==
=== United States ===
A spoiler campaign in the United States is often one that cannot realistically win but can still determine the outcome by pulling support from a more competitive candidate. The two major parties in the United States, the Republican Party and Democratic Party, have regularly won 98% of all state and federal seats. The US presidential elections most consistently cited as having been spoiled by third-party candidates are 1844 and 2000. The 2016 election is more disputed as to whether it contained spoiler candidates or not. For the 2024 presidential election, Republican lawyers and operatives have fought to keep right-leaning third-parties like the Constitution Party off swing state ballots while working to get Cornel West on battleground ballots. Democrats have helped some right-leaning third-parties gain ballot access while challenging ballot access of left-leaning third-parties like the Green Party. According to the &quot;Associated Press&quot;, the GOP effort to prop up possible spoiler candidates in 2024 appears more far-reaching than the Democratic effort. Barry Burden argues that they have almost no chance of winning the 2024 election but are often motivated by particular issues.

Third party candidates are always controversial because almost anyone could play spoiler. This is especially true in close elections where the chances of a spoiler effect increase. Strategic voting, especially prevalent during high stakes elections with high political polarization, often leads to a third-party that underperforms its poll numbers with voters wanting to make sure their least favorite candidate is not in power. Third-party campaigns are more likely to result in the candidate a third party voter least wants in the White House. Third-party candidates prefer to focus on their platform than on their impact on the frontrunners.

=== Notable unintentional spoilers ===
An unintentional spoiler is one that has a realistic chance of winning but falls short and affects the outcome of the election. Some third-party candidates express ambivalence about which major party they prefer and their possible role as spoiler or deny the possibility.

==== 2009 Burlington mayoral election ====
In Burlington, Vermont&#x27;s second IRV election, spoiler Kurt Wright knocked out Democrat Andy Montroll in the second round, leading to the election of Bob Kiss, despite the election results showing most voters preferred Montroll to Kiss. The results of every possible one-on-one election can be completed as follows:

This leads to an overall preference ranking of:

# Montroll – defeats all candidates below, including Kiss (4,064 to 3,476)
# Kiss – defeats all candidates below, including Wright (4,313 to 4,061)
# Wright – defeats all candidates below, including Smith (3,971 to 3,793)
# Smith – defeats Simpson (5,570 to 721) and the write-in candidates

Montroll was therefore preferred over Kiss by 54% of voters, over Wright by 56%, and over Smith by 60%. Had Wright not run, Montroll would have won instead of Kiss.

Because all ballots were fully released, it is possible to reconstruct the winners under other voting methods. While Wright would have won under plurality, Kiss won under IRV, and would have won under a two-round vote or a traditional nonpartisan blanket primary. Montroll, being the majority-preferred candidate, would have won if the ballots were counted using ranked pairs (or any other Condorcet method).

==== 2022 Alaska&#x27;s at-large congressional district special election ====
In Alaska&#x27;s first-ever IRV election, Nick Begich was eliminated in the first round to advance Mary Peltola and Sarah Palin. However, the pairwise comparison shows that Begich was the Condorcet winner while Palin was both the Condorcet loser and a spoiler:

In the wake of the election, a poll found 54% of Alaskans, including a third of Peltola voters, supported a repeal of RCV. Observers noted such pathologies would have occurred under Alaska&#x27;s previous primary system as well, leading several to suggest Alaska adopt any one of several alternatives without this behavior.

<doc id="39413" wikidata="Q844903" url="?curid=39413" title="Trisomy">
<text>A trisomy is a type of polysomy in which there are three instances of a particular chromosome, instead of the normal two. A trisomy is a type of aneuploidy (an abnormal number of chromosomes).

==Description and causes==

Most organisms that reproduce sexually have pairs of chromosomes in each cell, with one of each type of chromosome inherited from each parent. In such organisms, meiosis creates gamete cells (eggs or sperm) having only one set of chromosomes. The number of chromosomes is different for different species, with humans having 46 chromosomes (23 pairs) and human gametes 23 chromosomes.

If the chromosome pairs fail to separate properly during cell division, the egg or sperm may end up with a second copy of one of the chromosomes (non-disjunction). If such a gamete is fertilized with a normal gamete, the resulting embryo may have a total of three copies of the chromosome.

===Terminology===
The number of chromosomes in the cell where trisomy occurs is represented as, for example, 2&quot;n&quot;+1 if one chromosome shows trisomy, 2&quot;n&quot;+1+1 if two show trisomy, etc.
*&quot;Full trisomy&quot;, also called &quot;primary trisomy&quot;, means that an entire extra chromosome has been copied.
*&quot;Partial trisomy&quot; means that there is an extra copy of part of a chromosome.
*&quot;Secondary trisomy&quot; - the extra chromosome has quadruplicated arms (the arms are identical; it is an &quot;isochromosome&quot;). 
*&quot;Tertiary trisomy&quot; - the extra chromosome is made up of copies of arms from two other chromosomes.

Trisomies are sometimes characterised as &quot;autosomal trisomies&quot; (trisomies of the non-sex chromosomes) and &quot;sex-chromosome trisomies.&quot; Autosomal trisomies are described by referencing the specific chromosome that has an extra copy. Thus, for example, the presence of an extra chromosome 21, which is found in Down syndrome, is called trisomy 21.

==Human trisomy==

Trisomies can occur with any chromosome, but often result in miscarriage rather than live birth. For example, Trisomy 16 is most common in human pregnancies, occurring in more than 1%, but the only surviving embryos are those having some normal cells in addition to the trisomic cells (mosaic trisomy 16). Furthermore, even these embryos usually suffer spontaneous miscarriage in the first trimester.

The most common types of human autosomal (non-sex chromosome) trisomy that survive to birth are:

*Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome)
*Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome)
*Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome)
*Trisomy 9
*Trisomy 8 (Warkany syndrome 2)

Of these, Trisomy 21 and Trisomy 18 are the most common. In rare cases, a fetus with Trisomy 13 can survive, giving rise to Patau syndrome. Autosomal trisomy can be associated with birth defects, intellectual disability and shortened life.

&quot;Trisomy of sex chromosomes&quot; can also occur and include:

*XXX (Triple X syndrome)
*XXY (Klinefelter syndrome)
*XYY (Jacobs syndrome)
Compared to trisomy of the autosomal chromosomes, trisomy of the sex chromosomes normally has less severe consequences. Individuals may show few or no symptoms and have a normal life expectancy.

<doc id="39418" wikidata="Q178655" url="?curid=39418" title="Moore's law">
<text>Moore&#x27;s law is the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. Moore&#x27;s law is an observation and projection of a historical trend. Rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship. It is an experience-curve law, a type of law quantifying efficiency gains from experience in production.

The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel and former CEO of the latter, who in 1965 noted that the number of components per integrated circuit had been doubling every year, and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade. In 1975, looking forward to the next decade, he revised the forecast to doubling every two years, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 41%. Moore&#x27;s empirical evidence did not directly imply that the historical trend would continue, nevertheless, his prediction has held since 1975 and has since become known as a &quot;law&quot;.

Moore&#x27;s prediction has been used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development, thus functioning to some extent as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Advancements in digital electronics, such as the reduction in quality-adjusted microprocessor prices, the increase in memory capacity (RAM and flash), the improvement of sensors, and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras, are strongly linked to Moore&#x27;s law. These ongoing changes in digital electronics have been a driving force of technological and social change, productivity, and economic growth.

Industry experts have not reached a consensus on exactly when Moore&#x27;s law will cease to apply. Microprocessor architects report that semiconductor advancement has slowed industry-wide since around 2010, slightly below the pace predicted by Moore&#x27;s law. In September 2022, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang considered Moore&#x27;s law dead, while Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger was of the opposite view.

== History ==
In 1959, Douglas Engelbart studied the projected downscaling of integrated circuit (IC) size, publishing his results in the article &quot;Microelectronics, and the Art of Similitude&quot;. Engelbart presented his findings at the 1960 International Solid-State Circuits Conference, where Moore was present in the audience.

In 1965, Gordon Moore, who at the time was working as the director of research and development at Fairchild Semiconductor, was asked to contribute to the thirty-fifth-anniversary issue of &quot;Electronics&quot; magazine with a prediction on the future of the semiconductor components industry over the next ten years. His response was a brief article entitled &quot;Cramming more components onto integrated circuits&quot;. Within his editorial, he speculated that by 1975 it would be possible to contain as many as components on a single quarter-square-inch (~ ) semiconductor.

The complexity for minimum component costs has increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year. Certainly over the short term this rate can be expected to continue, if not to increase. Over the longer term, the rate of increase is a bit more uncertain, although there is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly constant for at least 10 years.

Moore posited a log–linear relationship between device complexity (higher circuit density at reduced cost) and time. In a 2015 interview, Moore noted of the 1965 article: &quot;... I just did a wild extrapolation saying it&#x27;s going to continue to double every year for the next 10 years.&quot; One historian of the law cites Stigler&#x27;s law of eponymy, to introduce the fact that the regular doubling of components was known to many working in the field.

In 1974, Robert H. Dennard at IBM recognized the rapid MOSFET scaling technology and formulated what became known as Dennard scaling, which describes that as MOS transistors get smaller, their power density stays constant such that the power use remains in proportion with area. Evidence from the semiconductor industry shows that this inverse relationship between power density and areal density broke down in the mid-2000s.

At the 1975 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting, Moore revised his forecast rate, predicting semiconductor complexity would continue to double annually until about 1980, after which it would decrease to a rate of doubling approximately every two years. He outlined several contributing factors for this exponential behavior:
* The advent of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) technology
* The exponential rate of increase in die sizes, coupled with a decrease in defective densities, with the result that semiconductor manufacturers could work with larger areas without losing reduction yields
* Finer minimum dimensions
* What Moore called &quot;circuit and device cleverness&quot;

Shortly after 1975, Caltech professor Carver Mead popularized the term &quot;Moore&#x27;s law&quot;. Moore&#x27;s law eventually came to be widely accepted as a goal for the semiconductor industry, and it was cited by competitive semiconductor manufacturers as they strove to increase processing power. Moore viewed his eponymous law as surprising and optimistic: &quot;Moore&#x27;s law is a violation of Murphy&#x27;s law. Everything gets better and better.&quot; The observation was even seen as a self-fulfilling prophecy.

The doubling period is often misquoted as 18 months because of a separate prediction by Moore&#x27;s colleague, Intel executive David House. In 1975, House noted that Moore&#x27;s revised law of doubling transistor count every 2 years in turn implied that computer chip performance would roughly double every 18 months, with no increase in power consumption. Mathematically, Moore&#x27;s law predicted that transistor count would double every 2 years due to shrinking transistor dimensions and other improvements. As a consequence of shrinking dimensions, Dennard scaling predicted that power consumption per unit area would remain constant. Combining these effects, David House deduced that computer chip performance would roughly double every 18 months. Also due to Dennard scaling, this increased performance would not be accompanied by increased power, i.e., the energy-efficiency of silicon-based computer chips roughly doubles every 18 months. Dennard scaling ended in the 2000s. Koomey later showed that a similar rate of efficiency improvement predated silicon chips and Moore&#x27;s law, for technologies such as vacuum tubes.

Microprocessor architects report that since around 2010, semiconductor advancement has slowed industry-wide below the pace predicted by Moore&#x27;s law. Brian Krzanich, the former CEO of Intel, cited Moore&#x27;s 1975 revision as a precedent for the current deceleration, which results from technical challenges and is &quot;a natural part of the history of Moore&#x27;s law&quot;. The rate of improvement in physical dimensions known as Dennard scaling also ended in the mid-2000s. As a result, much of the semiconductor industry has shifted its focus to the needs of major computing applications rather than semiconductor scaling. Nevertheless, leading semiconductor manufacturers TSMC and Samsung Electronics have claimed to keep pace with Moore&#x27;s law with 10, 7, and 5 nm nodes in mass production.

=== Moore&#x27;s second law ===
As the cost of computer power to the consumer falls, the cost for producers to fulfill Moore&#x27;s law follows an opposite trend: R&amp;D, manufacturing, and test costs have increased steadily with each new generation of chips. The cost of the tools, principally EUVL (Extreme ultraviolet lithography), used to manufacture chips doubles every 4 years. Rising manufacturing costs are an important consideration for the sustaining of Moore&#x27;s law. This led to the formulation of Moore&#x27;s second law, also called Rock&#x27;s law (named after Arthur Rock), which is that the capital cost of a semiconductor fabrication plant also increases exponentially over time.

== Major enabling factors ==

Numerous innovations by scientists and engineers have sustained Moore&#x27;s law since the beginning of the IC era. Some of the key innovations are listed below, as examples of breakthroughs that have advanced integrated circuit and semiconductor device fabrication technology, allowing transistor counts to grow by more than seven orders of magnitude in less than five decades.
* Integrated circuit (IC): The &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; for Moore&#x27;s law. The germanium hybrid IC was invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in 1958, followed by the invention of the silicon monolithic IC chip by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959.
* Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS): The CMOS process was invented by Chih-Tang Sah and Frank Wanlass at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1963.
* Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM): DRAM was developed by Robert H. Dennard at IBM in 1967.
* Chemically amplified photoresist: Invented by Hiroshi Ito, C. Grant Willson and J. M. J. Fréchet at IBM &quot;circa&quot; 1980, which was 5–10 times more sensitive to ultraviolet light. IBM introduced chemically amplified photoresist for DRAM production in the mid-1980s.
* Deep UV excimer laser photolithography: Invented by Kanti Jain at IBM &quot;circa&quot; 1980. Prior to this, excimer lasers had been mainly used as research devices since their development in the 1970s. From a broader scientific perspective, the invention of excimer laser lithography has been highlighted as one of the major milestones in the 50-year history of the laser.
* Interconnect innovations: Interconnect innovations of the late 1990s, including chemical-mechanical polishing or chemical mechanical planarization (CMP), trench isolation, and copper interconnects—although not directly a factor in creating smaller transistors—have enabled improved wafer yield, additional layers of metal wires, closer spacing of devices, and lower electrical resistance.

Computer industry technology road maps predicted in 2001 that Moore&#x27;s law would continue for several generations of semiconductor chips.

=== Recent trends ===
One of the key technical challenges of engineering future nanoscale transistors is the design of gates. As device dimensions shrink, controlling the current flow in the thin channel becomes more difficult. Modern nanoscale transistors typically take the form of multi-gate MOSFETs, with the FinFET being the most common nanoscale transistor. The FinFET has gate dielectric on three sides of the channel. In comparison, the gate-all-around MOSFET (GAAFET) structure has even better gate control.

* A gate-all-around MOSFET (GAAFET) was first demonstrated in 1988, by a Toshiba research team led by Fujio Masuoka, who demonstrated a vertical nanowire GAAFET that he called a surrounding gate transistor (SGT). Masuoka, best known as the inventor of flash memory, later left Toshiba and founded Unisantis Electronics in 2004 to research surrounding-gate technology along with Tohoku University.
* In 2006, a team of Korean researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and the National Nano Fab Center developed a 3 nm transistor, the world&#x27;s smallest nanoelectronic device at the time, based on FinFET technology.
* In 2010, researchers at the Tyndall National Institute in Cork, Ireland announced a junctionless transistor. A control gate wrapped around a silicon nanowire can control the passage of electrons without the use of junctions or doping. They claim these may be produced at 10 nm scale using existing fabrication techniques.
* In 2011, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh announced the development of a single-electron transistor, 1.5 nm in diameter, made out of oxide-based materials. Three wires converge on a central island that can house one or two electrons. Electrons tunnel from one wire to another through the island. Conditions on the third wire result in distinct conductive properties including the ability of the transistor to act as a solid-state memory. Nanowire transistors could spur the creation of microscopic computers.
* In 2012, a research team at the University of New South Wales announced the development of the first working transistor consisting of a single atom placed precisely in a silicon crystal (not just picked from a large sample of random transistors). Moore&#x27;s law predicted this milestone to be reached for ICs in the lab by 2020.
* In 2015, IBM demonstrated 7 nm node chips with silicon–germanium transistors produced using EUVL. The company believed this transistor density would be four times that of the then-current 14 nm chips.
* Samsung and TSMC plan to manufacture 3nm GAAFET nodes by 20212022. Note that node names, such as 3nm, have no relation to the physical size of device elements (transistors).
* A Toshiba research team including T. Imoto, M. Matsui and C. Takubo developed a &quot;system block module&quot; wafer bonding process for manufacturing three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) packages in 2001. In April 2007, Toshiba introduced an eight-layer 3D IC, the 16GB THGAM embedded NAND flash memory chip that was manufactured with eight stacked 2GB NAND flash chips. In September 2007, Hynix introduced 24-layer 3D IC, a 16GB flash memory chip that was manufactured with 24 stacked NAND flash chips using a wafer bonding process.
* V-NAND, also known as 3D NAND, allows flash memory cells to be stacked vertically using charge trap flash technology originally presented by John Szedon in 1967, significantly increasing the number of transistors on a flash memory chip. 3D NAND was first announced by Toshiba in 2007. V-NAND was first commercially manufactured by Samsung Electronics in 2013.
* In 2008, researchers at HP Labs announced a working memristor, a fourth basic passive circuit element whose existence only had been theorized previously. The memristor&#x27;s unique properties permit the creation of smaller and better-performing electronic devices.
* In 2014, bioengineers at Stanford University developed a circuit modeled on the human brain. Sixteen Neurocore chips simulate one million neurons and billions of synaptic connections, claimed to be times faster as well as more energy efficient than a typical PC.
* In 2015, Intel and Micron announced 3D XPoint, a non-volatile memory claimed to be significantly faster with similar density compared to NAND. Production scheduled to begin in 2016 was delayed until the second half of 2017.
* In 2017, Samsung combined its V-NAND technology with eUFS 3D IC stacking to produce a 512GB flash memory chip, with eight stacked 64-layer V-NAND dies. In 2019, Samsung produced a 1TB flash chip with eight stacked 96-layer V-NAND dies, along with quad-level cell (QLC) technology (4-bit per transistor), equivalent to 2trillion transistors, the highest transistor count of any IC chip.
* In 2020, Samsung Electronics planned to produce the 5 nm node, using FinFET and EUV technology.
* In May 2021, IBM announced the creation of the first 2 nm computer chip, with parts supposedly being smaller than human DNA.

Microprocessor architects report that semiconductor advancement has slowed industry-wide since around 2010, below the pace predicted by Moore&#x27;s law. Brian Krzanich, the former CEO of Intel, announced, &quot;Our cadence today is closer to two and a half years than two.&quot; Intel stated in 2015 that improvements in MOSFET devices have slowed, starting at the 22 nm feature width around 2012, and continuing at 14 nm. Pat Gelsinger, Intel CEO, stated at the end of 2023 that &quot;we&#x27;re no longer in the golden era of Moore&#x27;s Law, it&#x27;s much, much harder now, so we&#x27;re probably doubling effectively closer to every three years now, so we&#x27;ve definitely seen a slowing.&quot;

The physical limits to transistor scaling have been reached due to source-to-drain leakage, limited gate metals and limited options for channel material. Other approaches are being investigated, which do not rely on physical scaling. These include the spin state of electron spintronics, tunnel junctions, and advanced confinement of channel materials via nano-wire geometry. Spin-based logic and memory options are being developed actively in labs.

=== Alternative materials research ===
The vast majority of current transistors on ICs are composed principally of doped silicon and its alloys. As silicon is fabricated into single nanometer transistors, short-channel effects adversely changes desired material properties of silicon as a functional transistor. Below are several non-silicon substitutes in the fabrication of small nanometer transistors.

One proposed material is indium gallium arsenide, or InGaAs. Compared to their silicon and germanium counterparts, InGaAs transistors are more promising for future high-speed, low-power logic applications. Because of intrinsic characteristics of III–V compound semiconductors, quantum well and tunnel effect transistors based on InGaAs have been proposed as alternatives to more traditional MOSFET designs.
* In the early 2000s, the atomic layer deposition high-κ film and pitch double-patterning processes were invented by Gurtej Singh Sandhu at Micron Technology, extending Moore&#x27;s law for planar CMOS technology to 30 nm class and smaller.
* In 2009, Intel announced the development of 80 nm InGaAs quantum well transistors. Quantum well devices contain a material sandwiched between two layers of material with a wider band gap. Despite being double the size of leading pure silicon transistors at the time, the company reported that they performed equally as well while consuming less power.
* In 2011, researchers at Intel demonstrated 3-D tri-gate InGaAs transistors with improved leakage characteristics compared to traditional planar designs. The company claims that their design achieved the best electrostatics of any III–V compound semiconductor transistor. At the 2015 International Solid-State Circuits Conference, Intel mentioned the use of III–V compounds based on such an architecture for their 7 nm node.
* In 2011, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin developed an InGaAs tunneling field-effect transistors capable of higher operating currents than previous designs. The first III–V TFET designs were demonstrated in 2009 by a joint team from Cornell University and Pennsylvania State University.
* In 2012, a team in MIT&#x27;s Microsystems Technology Laboratories developed a 22 nm transistor based on InGaAs that, at the time, was the smallest non-silicon transistor ever built. The team used techniques used in silicon device fabrication and aimed for better electrical performance and a reduction to 10-nanometer scale.

Biological computing research shows that biological material has superior information density and energy efficiency compared to silicon-based computing.
Various forms of graphene are being studied for graphene electronics, e.g. graphene nanoribbon transistors have shown promise since its appearance in publications in 2008. (Bulk graphene has a band gap of zero and thus cannot be used in transistors because of its constant conductivity, an inability to turn off. The zigzag edges of the nanoribbons introduce localized energy states in the conduction and valence bands and thus a bandgap that enables switching when fabricated as a transistor. As an example, a typical GNR of width of 10 nm has a desirable bandgap energy of 0.4 eV.) More research will need to be performed, however, on sub-50 nm graphene layers, as its resistivity value increases and thus electron mobility decreases.

== Forecasts and roadmaps ==
In April 2005, Gordon Moore stated in an interview that the projection cannot be sustained indefinitely: &quot;It can&#x27;t continue forever. The nature of exponentials is that you push them out and eventually disaster happens.&quot; He also noted that transistors eventually would reach the limits of miniaturization at atomic levels:
In 2016 the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors, after using Moore&#x27;s Law to drive the industry since 1998, produced its final roadmap. It no longer centered its research and development plan on Moore&#x27;s law. Instead, it outlined what might be called the More than Moore strategy in which the needs of applications drive chip development, rather than a focus on semiconductor scaling. Application drivers range from smartphones to AI to data centers.

IEEE began a road-mapping initiative in 2016, Rebooting Computing, named the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS).

Some forecasters, including Gordon Moore, predict that Moore&#x27;s law will end by around 2025. Although Moore&#x27;s Law will reach a physical limit, some forecasters are optimistic about the continuation of technological progress in a variety of other areas, including new chip architectures, quantum computing, and AI and machine learning. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declared Moore&#x27;s law dead in 2022; several days later, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger countered with the opposite claim.

== Consequences ==
Digital electronics have contributed to world economic growth in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. The primary driving force of economic growth is the growth of productivity, which Moore&#x27;s law factors into. Moore (1995) expected that &quot;the rate of technological progress is going to be controlled from financial realities&quot;. The reverse could and did occur around the late-1990s, however, with economists reporting that &quot;Productivity growth is the key economic indicator of innovation.&quot; Moore&#x27;s law describes a driving force of technological and social change, productivity, and economic growth.

An acceleration in the rate of semiconductor progress contributed to a surge in U.S. productivity growth, which reached 3.4% per year in 1997–2004, outpacing the 1.6% per year during both 1972–1996 and 2005–2013. As economist Richard G. Anderson notes, &quot;Numerous studies have traced the cause of the productivity acceleration to technological innovations in the production of semiconductors that sharply reduced the prices of such components and of the products that contain them (as well as expanding the capabilities of such products).&quot;

The primary negative implication of Moore&#x27;s law is that obsolescence pushes society up against the Limits to Growth. As technologies continue to rapidly improve, they render predecessor technologies obsolete. In situations in which security and survivability of hardware or data are paramount, or in which resources are limited, rapid obsolescence often poses obstacles to smooth or continued operations.

== Other formulations and similar observations ==
Several measures of digital technology are improving at exponential rates related to Moore&#x27;s law, including the size, cost, density, and speed of components. Moore wrote only about the density of components, &quot;a component being a transistor, resistor, diode or capacitor&quot;, at minimum cost.

&quot;Transistors per integrated circuit&quot; – The most popular formulation is of the doubling of the number of transistors on ICs every two years. At the end of the 1970s, Moore&#x27;s law became known as the limit for the number of transistors on the most complex chips. The graph at the top of this article shows this trend holds true today. , the commercially available processor possessing one of the highest numbers of transistors is an AD102 graphics processor with more than 76,3 billion transistors.

&quot;Density at minimum cost per transistor&quot; – This is the formulation given in Moore&#x27;s 1965 paper. It is not just about the density of transistors that can be achieved, but about the density of transistors at which the cost per transistor is the lowest.

As more transistors are put on a chip, the cost to make each transistor decreases, but the chance that the chip will not work due to a defect increases. In 1965, Moore examined the density of transistors at which cost is minimized, and observed that, as transistors were made smaller through advances in photolithography, this number would increase at &quot;a rate of roughly a factor of two per year&quot;.

&quot;Dennard scaling&quot; – This posits that power usage would decrease in proportion to area (both voltage and current being proportional to length) of transistors. Combined with Moore&#x27;s law, performance per watt would grow at roughly the same rate as transistor density, doubling every 1–2 years. According to Dennard scaling transistor dimensions would be scaled by 30% (0.7×) every technology generation, thus reducing their area by 50%. This would reduce the delay by 30% (0.7×) and therefore increase operating frequency by about 40% (1.4×). Finally, to keep electric field constant, voltage would be reduced by 30%, reducing energy by 65% and power (at 1.4× frequency) by 50%. Therefore, in every technology generation transistor density would double, circuit becomes 40% faster, while power consumption (with twice the number of transistors) stays the same. Dennard scaling ended in 2005–2010, due to leakage currents.

The exponential processor transistor growth predicted by Moore does not always translate into exponentially greater practical CPU performance. Since around 2005–2007, Dennard scaling has ended, so even though Moore&#x27;s law continued after that, it has not yielded proportional dividends in improved performance. The primary reason cited for the breakdown is that at small sizes, current leakage poses greater challenges, and also causes the chip to heat up, which creates a threat of thermal runaway and therefore, further increases energy costs.

The breakdown of Dennard scaling prompted a greater focus on multicore processors, but the gains offered by switching to more cores are lower than the gains that would be achieved had Dennard scaling continued. In another departure from Dennard scaling, Intel microprocessors adopted a non-planar tri-gate FinFET at 22 nm in 2012 that is faster and consumes less power than a conventional planar transistor. The rate of performance improvement for single-core microprocessors has slowed significantly. Single-core performance was improving by 52% per year in 1986–2003 and 23% per year in 2003–2011, but slowed to just seven percent per year in 2011–2018.

&quot;Quality adjusted price of IT equipment&quot; – The price of information technology (IT), computers and peripheral equipment, adjusted for quality and inflation, declined 16% per year on average over the five decades from 1959 to 2009. The pace accelerated, however, to 23% per year in 1995–1999 triggered by faster IT innovation, and later, slowed to 2% per year in 2010–2013.

While quality-adjusted microprocessor price improvement continues, the rate of improvement likewise varies, and is not linear on a log scale. Microprocessor price improvement accelerated during the late 1990s, reaching 60% per year (halving every nine months) versus the typical 30% improvement rate (halving every two years) during the years earlier and later. Laptop microprocessors in particular improved 25–35% per year in 2004–2010, and slowed to 15–25% per year in 2010–2013.

The number of transistors per chip cannot explain quality-adjusted microprocessor prices fully. Moore&#x27;s 1995 paper does not limit Moore&#x27;s law to strict linearity or to transistor count, &quot;The definition of &#x27;Moore&#x27;s Law&#x27; has come to refer to almost anything related to the semiconductor industry that on a semi-log plot approximates a straight line. I hesitate to review its origins and by doing so restrict its definition.&quot;

&quot;Hard disk drive areal density&quot; – A similar prediction (sometimes called Kryder&#x27;s law) was made in 2005 for hard disk drive areal density. The prediction was later viewed as over-optimistic. Several decades of rapid progress in areal density slowed around 2010, from 30 to 100% per year to 10–15% per year, because of noise related to smaller grain size of the disk media, thermal stability, and writability using available magnetic fields.

&quot;Fiber-optic capacity&quot; – The number of bits per second that can be sent down an optical fiber increases exponentially, faster than Moore&#x27;s law. Keck&#x27;s law, in honor of Donald Keck.

&quot;Network capacity&quot; – According to Gerald Butters, the former head of Lucent&#x27;s Optical Networking Group at Bell Labs, there is another version, called Butters&#x27; Law of Photonics, a formulation that deliberately parallels Moore&#x27;s law. Butters&#x27; law says that the amount of data coming out of an optical fiber is doubling every nine months. Thus, the cost of transmitting a bit over an optical network decreases by half every nine months. The availability of wavelength-division multiplexing (sometimes called WDM) increased the capacity that could be placed on a single fiber by as much as a factor of 100. Optical networking and dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) is rapidly bringing down the cost of networking, and further progress seems assured. As a result, the wholesale price of data traffic collapsed in the dot-com bubble. Nielsen&#x27;s Law says that the bandwidth available to users increases by 50% annually.

&quot;Pixels per dollar&quot; – Similarly, Barry Hendy of Kodak Australia has plotted pixels per dollar as a basic measure of value for a digital camera, demonstrating the historical linearity (on a log scale) of this market and the opportunity to predict the future trend of digital camera price, LCD and LED screens, and resolution.

&quot;The great Moore&#x27;s law compensator (TGMLC)&quot;, also known as Wirth&#x27;s law – generally is referred to as software bloat and is the principle that successive generations of computer software increase in size and complexity, thereby offsetting the performance gains predicted by Moore&#x27;s law. In a 2008 article in InfoWorld, Randall C. Kennedy, formerly of Intel, introduces this term using successive versions of Microsoft Office between the year 2000 and 2007 as his premise. Despite the gains in computational performance during this time period according to Moore&#x27;s law, Office 2007 performed the same task at half the speed on a prototypical year 2007 computer as compared to Office 2000 on a year 2000 computer.

&quot;Library expansion&quot; – was calculated in 1945 by Fremont Rider to double in capacity every 16 years, if sufficient space were made available. He advocated replacing bulky, decaying printed works with miniaturized microform analog photographs, which could be duplicated on-demand for library patrons or other institutions. He did not foresee the digital technology that would follow decades later to replace analog microform with digital imaging, storage, and transmission media. Automated, potentially lossless digital technologies allowed vast increases in the rapidity of information growth in an era that now sometimes is called the Information Age.

&quot;Carlson curve&quot; – is a term coined by &quot;The Economist&quot; to describe the biotechnological equivalent of Moore&#x27;s law, and is named after author Rob Carlson. Carlson accurately predicted that the doubling time of DNA sequencing technologies (measured by cost and performance) would be at least as fast as Moore&#x27;s law. Carlson Curves illustrate the rapid (in some cases hyperexponential) decreases in cost, and increases in performance, of a variety of technologies, including DNA sequencing, DNA synthesis, and a range of physical and computational tools used in protein expression and in determining protein structures.

&quot;Eroom&#x27;s law&quot; – is a pharmaceutical drug development observation that was deliberately written as Moore&#x27;s Law spelled backward in order to contrast it with the exponential advancements of other forms of technology (such as transistors) over time. It states that the cost of developing a new drug roughly doubles every nine years.

&quot;Experience curve effects&quot; says that each doubling of the cumulative production of virtually any product or service is accompanied by an approximate constant percentage reduction in the unit cost. The acknowledged first documented qualitative description of this dates from 1885. A power curve was used to describe this phenomenon in a 1936 discussion of the cost of airplanes.

&quot;Edholm&#x27;s law&quot; – Phil Edholm observed that the bandwidth of telecommunication networks (including the Internet) is doubling every 18 months. The bandwidths of online communication networks has risen from bits per second to terabits per second. The rapid rise in online bandwidth is largely due to the same MOSFET scaling that enabled Moore&#x27;s law, as telecommunications networks are built from MOSFETs.

&quot;Haitz&#x27;s law&quot; predicts that the brightness of LEDs increases as their manufacturing cost goes down.

&quot;Swanson&#x27;s law&quot; is the observation that the price of solar photovoltaic modules tends to drop 20 percent for every doubling of cumulative shipped volume. At present rates, costs go down 75% about every 10 years.

<doc id="39420" wikidata="Q158688" url="?curid=39420" title="Right triangle">
<text>A right triangle or right-angled triangle, sometimes called an orthogonal triangle or rectangular triangle, is a triangle in which two sides are perpendicular, forming a right angle ( turn or 90 degrees).

The side opposite to the right angle is called the &quot;hypotenuse&quot; (side formula_1 in the figure). The sides adjacent to the right angle are called &quot;legs&quot; (or &quot;catheti&quot;, singular: &quot;cathetus&quot;). Side formula_2 may be identified as the side &quot;adjacent&quot; to angle formula_3 and &quot;opposite&quot; (or &quot;opposed to&quot;) angle formula_4 while side formula_5 is the side adjacent to angle formula_6 and opposite angle formula_7

Every right triangle is half of a rectangle which has been divided along its diagonal. When the rectangle is a square, its right-triangular half is isosceles, with two congruent sides and two congruent angles. When the rectangle is not a square, its right-triangular half is scalene.

Every triangle whose base is the diameter of a circle and whose apex lies on the circle is a right triangle, with the right angle at the apex and the hypotenuse as the base; conversely, the circumcircle of any right triangle has the hypotenuse as its diameter. This is Thales&#x27; theorem.

The legs and hypotenuse of a right triangle satisfy the Pythagorean theorem: the sum of the areas of the squares on two legs is the area of the square on the hypotenuse, formula_8 If the lengths of all three sides of a right triangle are integers, the triangle is called a Pythagorean triangle and its side lengths are collectively known as a &quot;Pythagorean triple&quot;.

The relations between the sides and angles of a right triangle provides one way of defining and understanding trigonometry, the study of the metrical relationships between lengths and angles.

==Principal properties==

===Sides===

The three sides of a right triangle are related by the Pythagorean theorem, which in modern algebraic notation can be written

:formula_9

where formula_1 is the length of the &quot;hypotenuse&quot; (side opposite the right angle), and formula_2 and formula_5 are the lengths of the &quot;legs&quot; (remaining two sides). Pythagorean triples are integer values of formula_13 satisfying this equation. This theorem was proven in antiquity, and is proposition I.47 in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;: &quot;In right-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle.&quot;

===Area===
As with any triangle, the area is equal to one half the base multiplied by the corresponding height. In a right triangle, if one leg is taken as the base then the other is height, so the area of a right triangle is one half the product of the two legs. As a formula the area formula_14 is
:formula_15

where formula_2 and formula_5 are the legs of the triangle.

If the incircle is tangent to the hypotenuse formula_18 at point formula_19 then letting the semi-perimeter be formula_20 we have formula_21 and formula_22 and the area is given by
:formula_23

This formula only applies to right triangles.

===Altitudes===

If an altitude is drawn from the vertex, with the right angle to the hypotenuse, then the triangle is divided into two smaller triangles; these are both similar to the original, and therefore similar to each other. From this:
* The altitude to the hypotenuse is the geometric mean (mean proportional) of the two segments of the hypotenuse.
* Each leg of the triangle is the mean proportional of the hypotenuse and the segment of the hypotenuse that is adjacent to the leg.
In equations,
:formula_24 (this is sometimes known as the right triangle altitude theorem)
:formula_25
:formula_26

where formula_27 are as shown in the diagram. Thus
:formula_28

Moreover, the altitude to the hypotenuse is related to the legs of the right triangle by
:formula_29

For solutions of this equation in integer values of formula_30 see here.

The altitude from either leg coincides with the other leg. Since these intersect at the right-angled vertex, the right triangle&#x27;s orthocenter—the intersection of its three altitudes—coincides with the right-angled vertex.

===Inradius and circumradius===
The radius of the incircle of a right triangle with legs formula_2 and formula_5 and hypotenuse formula_1 is
:formula_34

The radius of the circumcircle is half the length of the hypotenuse,
:formula_35

Thus the sum of the circumradius and the inradius is half the sum of the legs:

:formula_36

One of the legs can be expressed in terms of the inradius and the other leg as
:formula_37

==Characterizations==
A triangle formula_38 with sides formula_39, semiperimeter formula_40, area formula_41 altitude formula_42 opposite the longest side, circumradius formula_43 inradius formula_44 exradii formula_45 tangent to formula_46 respectively, and medians formula_47 is a right triangle if and only if any one of the statements in the following six categories is true. Each of them is thus also a property of any right triangle.

===Sides and semiperimeter===
* formula_48
* formula_49
* formula_50
* formula_51

===Angles===
* formula_6 and formula_3 are complementary.
* formula_54
* formula_55
* formula_56
* formula_57

===Area===
* formula_58
* formula_59
* formula_60
* formula_61
* formula_62 where formula_63 is the tangency point of the incircle at the longest side formula_64

===Inradius and exradii===
* formula_65
* formula_66
* formula_67
* formula_68
* formula_69
* formula_70
* formula_71

===Altitude and medians===

* formula_72
* formula_73
* The length of one median is equal to the circumradius.
* The shortest altitude (the one from the vertex with the biggest angle) is the geometric mean of the line segments it divides the opposite (longest) side into. This is the right triangle altitude theorem.

===Circumcircle and incircle===
* The triangle can be inscribed in a semicircle, with one side coinciding with the entirety of the diameter (Thales&#x27; theorem).
* The circumcenter is the midpoint of the longest side.
* The longest side is a diameter of the circumcircle formula_74
* The circumcircle is tangent to the nine-point circle.
* The orthocenter lies on the circumcircle.
* The distance between the incenter and the orthocenter is equal to formula_75.

==Trigonometric ratios==
The trigonometric functions for acute angles can be defined as ratios of the sides of a right triangle. For a given angle, a right triangle may be constructed with this angle, and the sides labeled opposite, adjacent and hypotenuse with reference to this angle according to the definitions above. These ratios of the sides do not depend on the particular right triangle chosen, but only on the given angle, since all triangles constructed this way are similar. If, for a given angle α, the opposite side, adjacent side and hypotenuse are labeled formula_76 formula_4 and formula_78 respectively, then the trigonometric functions are
:formula_79

For the expression of hyperbolic functions as ratio of the sides of a right triangle, see the hyperbolic triangle of a hyperbolic sector.

==Special right triangles==
The values of the trigonometric functions can be evaluated exactly for certain angles using right triangles with special angles. These include the 30-60-90 triangle which can be used to evaluate the trigonometric functions for any multiple of formula_80 and the isosceles right triangle or 45-45-90 triangle which can be used to evaluate the trigonometric functions for any multiple of formula_81

===Kepler triangle===
Let formula_78 formula_83 and formula_6 be the harmonic mean, the geometric mean, and the arithmetic mean of two positive numbers formula_2 and formula_5 with formula_87 If a right triangle has legs formula_88 and formula_89 and hypotenuse formula_4 then
:formula_91

where formula_92 is the golden ratio. Since the sides of this right triangle are in geometric progression, this is the Kepler triangle.

==Thales&#x27; theorem==
Thales&#x27; theorem states that if formula_93 is the diameter of a circle and formula_6 is any other point on the circle, then formula_38 is a right triangle with a right angle at formula_96 The converse states that the hypotenuse of a right triangle is the diameter of its circumcircle. As a corollary, the circumcircle has its center at the midpoint of the diameter, so the median through the right-angled vertex is a radius, and the circumradius is half the length of the hypotenuse.

==Medians==
The following formulas hold for the medians of a right triangle:
:formula_97

The median on the hypotenuse of a right triangle divides the triangle into two isosceles triangles, because the median equals one-half the hypotenuse.

The medians formula_98 and formula_99 from the legs satisfy

:formula_100

==Euler line==
In a right triangle, the Euler line contains the median on the hypotenuse—that is, it goes through both the right-angled vertex and the midpoint of the side opposite that vertex. This is because the right triangle&#x27;s orthocenter, the intersection of its altitudes, falls on the right-angled vertex while its circumcenter, the intersection of its perpendicular bisectors of sides, falls on the midpoint of the hypotenuse.

==Inequalities==

In any right triangle the diameter of the incircle is less than half the hypotenuse, and more strongly it is less than or equal to the hypotenuse times formula_101

In a right triangle with legs formula_102 and hypotenuse formula_103

:formula_104

with equality only in the isosceles case.

If the altitude from the hypotenuse is denoted formula_105 then

:formula_106

with equality only in the isosceles case.

==Other properties==
If segments of lengths formula_107 and formula_108 emanating from vertex formula_109 trisect the hypotenuse into segments of length formula_110 then
:formula_111

The right triangle is the only triangle having two, rather than one or three, distinct inscribed squares.

Given any two positive numbers formula_112 and formula_113 with formula_114 Let formula_112 and formula_113 be the sides of the two inscribed squares in a right triangle with hypotenuse formula_117 Then
:formula_118

These sides and the incircle radius formula_119 are related by a similar formula:

:formula_120

The perimeter of a right triangle equals the sum of the radii of the incircle and the three excircles:

:formula_121

<text>Primo Michele Levi (; 31 July 1919 – 11 April 1987) was a Jewish-Italian chemist, partisan, writer, and Holocaust survivor. He was the author of several books, collections of short stories, essays, poems and one novel. His best-known works include &quot;If This Is a Man&quot; (&quot;Se questo è un uomo&quot;, 1947, published as &quot;Survival in Auschwitz&quot; in the United States), his account of the year he spent as a prisoner in the Auschwitz concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, and &quot;The Periodic Table&quot; (1975), a collection of mostly autobiographical short stories, each named after a chemical element which plays a role in each story, which the Royal Institution named the best science book ever written.

Levi died in 1987 from injuries sustained in a fall from a third-story apartment landing. His death was officially ruled a suicide, although that has been disputed by some of his friends and associates and attributed to an accident.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Levi was born in 1919 in Turin, Italy, at Corso Re Umberto 75, into a liberal Jewish family. His father, Cesare Levi (1875–1942), worked for the manufacturing firm Ganz and spent much of his time working abroad in Hungary, where Ganz was based. Cesare was an avid reader and autodidact. Levi&#x27;s mother, Esterina (Ester Luzzati Levi, 1895–1991), known to everyone as Rina, was well educated, having attended the . She too was an avid reader, played the piano, and spoke fluent French. The marriage between Rina and Cesare had been arranged by Rina&#x27;s father. On their wedding day, Rina&#x27;s father, Cesare Luzzati, gave Rina the apartment at , where Primo Levi lived for almost his entire life.

In 1921, Anna Maria, Levi&#x27;s sister, was born, and he remained close to her all her life. In 1925, he entered the primary school in Turin. A thin and delicate child, he was shy and considered himself ugly, but excelled academically. His school record includes long periods of absence during which he was tutored at home, at first by Emilia Glauda and then by Marisa Zini, daughter of philosopher Zino Zini. The children spent summers with their mother in the Waldensian valleys south-west of Turin, where Rina rented a farmhouse. His father remained in the city, partly because of his dislike of the rural life, but also because of his infidelities.

In September 1930, Levi entered the Royal Gymnasium a year ahead of normal entrance requirements. In class, he was the youngest, the shortest and the cleverest, as well as being the only Jew. Only two boys there bullied him for being Jewish, but their animosity was traumatic. In August 1932, following two years attendance at the Talmud Torah school in Turin to pick up the elements of doctrine and culture, he sang in the local synagogue for his Bar Mitzvah. In 1933, as was expected of all young Italian schoolboys, he joined the Avanguardisti movement for young Fascists. He avoided rifle drill by joining the ski division, and spent every Saturday during the season on the slopes above Turin. As a young boy, Levi was plagued by illness, particularly chest infections, but he was keen to participate in physical activity. In his teens, Levi and a few friends would sneak into a disused sports stadium and conduct athletic competitions.

In July 1934, at the age of 15, he sat the exams for the Liceo Classico D&#x27;Azeglio, a lyceum (sixth form or senior high school) specializing in the classics, and was admitted that year. The school was noted for its anti-Fascist teachers, among them the philosopher Norberto Bobbio, and Cesare Pavese, who later became one of Italy&#x27;s best-known novelists. Levi continued to be bullied during his time at the Lyceum, although six other Jews were in his class. Upon reading &quot;Concerning the Nature of Things&quot; by English scientist Sir William Bragg, Levi decided that he wanted to be a chemist.

In 1937, he was summoned before the War Ministry and accused of ignoring a draft notice from the Italian Royal Navy. It was one day before he was to write a final examination on Italy&#x27;s participation in the Spanish Civil War, based on a quote from Thucydides: &quot;We have the singular merit of being brave to the utmost degree.&quot; Distracted and terrified by the draft accusation, he failed the exam—the first poor grade of his life—and was devastated. His father was able to keep him out of the Navy by enrolling him in the Fascist militia (&quot;Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale&quot;). He remained a member through his first year of university, until the passage of the Italian Racial Laws of 1938 forced his expulsion. Levi later recounted that series of events in the short story &quot;Fra Diavolo on the Po&quot;.

He retook and passed his final examinations and, in October, enrolled at the University of Turin to study chemistry. As one of 80 candidates, he spent three months taking lectures, and in February, after passing his &quot;colloquio&quot; (oral examination), he was selected as one of 20 to move on to the full-time chemistry curriculum.

During the liberal period in Italy, as well as in the first decade of the Fascist regime, Jews held many public positions, and were prominent in literature, science and politics. In 1929, Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty with the Catholic Church, which established Catholicism as the State religion, allowed the Church to influence many sectors of education and public life, and relegated other religions to the status of &quot;tolerated cults&quot;. In 1936, Italy&#x27;s conquest of Ethiopia, and the expansion of what the regime regarded as the Italian &quot;colonial empire&quot;, brought the question of &quot;race&quot; to the forefront. In the context set by those events, and the 1939 alliance with Hitler&#x27;s Germany, the situation of the Jews of Italy changed radically.

In July 1938, a group of prominent Italian scientists and intellectuals published the &quot;Manifesto of Race&quot;, a mixture of racial and ideological antisemitic theories from ancient and modern sources. The treatise formed the basis of the Italian Racial Laws of October 1938. After their enactment, Italian Jews lost their basic civil rights, positions in public offices, and their assets. Their books were prohibited, and Jewish writers could no longer publish in magazines owned by Aryans. Jewish students who had begun their course of study were permitted to continue, but new Jewish students were barred from entering university. Levi had matriculated a year earlier than scheduled, enabling him to take a degree.

In 1939, Levi discovered a passion for mountain hiking. A friend, Sandro Delmastro, taught him how to hike, and they spent many weekends in the mountains above Turin. Levi later wrote about that time in the chapter &quot;Iron&quot; in &quot;The Periodic Table:&quot; “To see Sandro in the mountains reconciled you with the world and made you forget the nightmare weighing on Europe [...] He stirred in me a new communion with earth and sky, in which my need for freedom, the fullness of my powers, and the hunger to understand things that had driven me to chemistry converged.”

In June 1940, as an ally of Germany, Italy declared war against Britain and France, and the first Allied air raids on Turin began two days later. Levi&#x27;s studies continued during the bombardments. The family suffered additional strain as his father became bedridden with bowel cancer.

=== Chemistry ===
Because of the new racial laws and the increasing intensity of Fascist action, Levi had difficulty finding an advisor for his Ph.D. dissertation, which was on the subject of the Walden inversion, a study of the asymmetry of the carbon atom. Eventually taken on by Dr. Nicolò Dallaporta, Levi graduated in mid-1941 with full marks and merit, having submitted additional theses on x-rays and electrostatic energy. His degree certificate bore the remark: &quot;of Jewish race&quot;. The racial laws prevented Levi from finding a suitable permanent job after graduation.

In December 1941, he received an informal job offer from an Italian officer to work as a chemist at an asbestos mine in San Vittore. The project was to extract nickel from the mine spoil, a challenge he accepted with pleasure. Levi later understood that, if successful, he would be aiding the German war effort, which was suffering nickel shortages in the production of armaments. The job required Levi to work under a false name with false papers. Three months later, in March 1942, his father died. Levi left the mine in June to work in Milan for the Swiss pharmaceutical manufacturer Wander AG, on a project to extract an anti-diabetic from vegetable matter. Recruited through a fellow student at Turin University, he took the job in a Swiss company to escape the Italian race laws. It soon became clear that the project had no chance of succeeding, but it was in no-one&#x27;s interest to say so.

In July 1943, King Victor Emmanuel III deposed Mussolini and appointed a new government under Marshal Pietro Badoglio, which prepared to sign the Armistice of Cassibile with the Allies. When the armistice was made public on 8 September, the Germans occupied northern and central Italy, liberated Mussolini from imprisonment, and appointed him as head of the Italian Social Republic, a puppet state in German-occupied northern Italy. Levi returned to Turin to find his mother and sister in refuge in their holiday home called &#x27;Lo Saccarello&#x27; (literally, the Sackcloth) in the village of Chieri in the hills outside Turin. The three moved to Saint-Vincent in the Aosta Valley, where they could be hidden. Being pursued as Jews, many of whom had already been interned by the authorities, they moved up the hillside to Amay in the , a rebellious area highly suitable for guerrilla activities.

=== Italian resistance movement ===
The Italian resistance movement became increasingly active in the German-occupied zone. Levi and some comrades took to the foothills of the Alps and, in October, formed a partisan group in the hope of being affiliated with the liberal &quot;Giustizia e Libertà&quot;. Untrained for such a venture, he and his companions were arrested by the Fascist militia on 13 December 1943. Believing he would be shot as an Italian partisan, Levi confessed to being Jewish. He was sent to the internment camp at Fossoli near Modena.

Levi later wrote the following about the conditions at Fossoli:
=== Auschwitz ===


Fossoli was taken over by the Germans, who started arranging the deportations of the Jews to eastern concentration and death camps. On 21 February 1944, on the second of the transports, Levi and other inmates were transported in twelve cramped cattle trucks to Monowitz, one of the three main camps in the Auschwitz concentration camp complex. Levi (record number 174517) spent eleven months there before the camp was liberated by the Red Army on 27 January 1945. Before the arrival of the Russians, inmates were sorted according to whether they could work or not. An acquaintance of Levi&#x27;s said that neither classification would make any difference in the end. He declared he was unable to work and was killed immediately. Of the 650 Italian Jews in his transport, Levi was one of only twenty who left the camps alive. The average life expectancy of a new entrant to the camp was three to four months.

Levi knew some German from reading German publications on chemistry, and he worked to adjust quickly to life in the camp without attracting the attention of the privileged inmates. He used bread to pay a more experienced Italian prisoner for German lessons and understanding how to cope in Auschwitz. He was given a smuggled soup ration each day by Lorenzo Perrone, an Italian civilian bricklayer who was working at Auschwitz as a forced labourer. Levi&#x27;s professional qualifications were useful to the Germans and, in mid-November 1944, he secured a position as an assistant in IG Farben&#x27;s Buna Werke laboratory that was aiming to produce synthetic rubber. By avoiding hard labour in freezing outdoor temperatures he was able to survive, as well as by stealing materials from the laboratory and trading them for extra food. Shortly before the camp was liberated by the Red Army, he fell ill with scarlet fever and was placed in the camp&#x27;s sanatorium (camp hospital). On 18 January 1945, the SS hurriedly evacuated the camp as the Red Army approached, forcing all but the gravely ill on a long death march to a site further from the front. The march resulted in the deaths of the vast majority of the remaining prisoners, but Levi&#x27;s illness spared him that fate.

Although liberated on 27 January 1945, Levi did not reach Turin until 19 October 1945. After spending some time in a Soviet camp for former concentration camp inmates, he embarked on an arduous journey home in the company of former Italian prisoners of war who had been part of the Italian Army in Russia. The long railway journey home to Turin took him on a circuitous route from Poland, through Belarus, Ukraine, Romania, Hungary, Austria, and Germanyan arduous journey described especially in his 1963 work &quot;The Truce&quot;noting the millions of displaced people on the roads and trains throughout Europe in that period.

=== Writing career ===

==== 1946–1960 ====
Levi was almost unrecognisable on his return to Turin. Malnutrition edema had bloated his face. Sporting a scrawny beard and wearing an old Red Army uniform, he returned to Corso Re Umberto. The next few months gave him an opportunity to recover physically, re-establish contact with surviving friends and family, and start looking for work. Levi suffered from the psychological trauma of his experiences. Having been unable to find work in Turin, he started to look for work in Milan. On his train journeys, he began to tell people he met stories about his time at Auschwitz.

At a Jewish New Year party in 1946, he met Lucia Morpurgo, who offered to teach him to dance, and Levi fell in love with her. At about that time, he started writing poetry about his experiences in Auschwitz.

On 21 January 1946, he started work at DUCO, a Du Pont Company paint factory outside Turin. Because of the extremely limited train service, Levi stayed in the factory dormitory during the week, which gave him the opportunity to write undisturbed, and he started the first draft of &quot;If This Is a Man&quot;. Every day, as memories came to him, he scribbled notes on train tickets and scraps of paper. At the end of February, he had ten pages detailing the last ten days between the German evacuation and the arrival of the Red Army. For the next ten months, the book took shape in his dormitory as he typed up his recollections each night.

On 22 December 1946, the manuscript was complete. Lucia, who now reciprocated Levi&#x27;s love, helped him to edit it, to make the narrative flow more naturally. In January 1947, Levi was taking the finished manuscript around to publishers. It was rejected by Einaudi on the advice of Natalia Ginzburg and, in the United States, it was turned down by Little, Brown and Company on the advice of rabbi Joshua Liebman, an opinion which contributed to the neglect of his work in that country for four decades. The social wounds of the war years were still too fresh, and he had no literary experience to give him a reputation as an author.

Eventually, Levi found a publisher, Franco Antonicelli, through a friend of his sister. Antonicelli was an amateur publisher, but as an active anti-Fascist, he supported the substance of the book.

At the end of June 1947, Levi suddenly left DUCO and teamed up with an old friend Alberto Salmoni to run a chemical consultancy from the top floor of Salmoni&#x27;s parents&#x27; house. Many of Levi&#x27;s experiences of that time found their way into his later writing. He and Salmoni made most of their money from making and supplying stannous chloride for mirror makers, delivering the unstable chemical by bicycle across the city. Attempts to make lipsticks from reptile excreta, and a coloured enamel to coat teeth, were turned into short stories. Accidents in their laboratory filled the Salmoni house with unpleasant smells and corrosive gases.

In September 1947, Levi married Lucia and, a month later, on 11 October, &quot;If This Is a Man&quot; was published, with a print run of 2,000 copies. In April 1948, with Lucia pregnant with their first child, Levi decided that the life of an independent chemist was too precarious. He agreed to work for Accatti in the family paint business, which traded under the name SIVA. In October 1948, his daughter Lisa was born.

During that period, his friend Lorenzo Perrone&#x27;s physical and psychological health declined. Lorenzo had been a civilian forced worker in Auschwitz, who for six months had given part of his ration and a piece of bread to Levi without asking for anything in return, and the gesture saved Levi&#x27;s life. In his memoir, Levi contrasted Lorenzo with everyone else in the camp, prisoners and guards alike, as someone who managed to preserve his humanity. After the war, Lorenzo could not cope with the memories of what he had seen and descended into alcoholism. Levi made several trips to rescue his old friend from the streets but, in 1952, Lorenzo died. In gratitude for his kindness in Auschwitz, Levi named both of his children, Lisa Lorenza and Renzo, after him.

In 1950, having demonstrated his chemical talents to Accatti, Levi was promoted to Technical Director at SIVA. As SIVA&#x27;s principal chemist and troubleshooter, Levi travelled abroad. He made several trips to Germany and carefully engineered his contacts with senior German businessmen and scientists. Wearing short-sleeved shirts, he made sure they saw the concentration camp number tattooed on his arm.

He became involved in organisations pledged to remembering and recording the horror of the camps. In 1954, he visited Buchenwald to mark the ninth anniversary of the camp&#x27;s liberation from the Nazis. Levi dutifully attended many such anniversary events over the years and recounted his own experiences. In July 1957, his son Renzo was born.

Despite a positive review by Italo Calvino in , only 1,500 copies of &quot;If This Is a Man&quot; were sold. In 1958, Einaudi, a major publisher, published it in a revised form and promoted it.

In 1958 Stuart Woolf, in close collaboration with Levi, translated &quot;If This Is a Man&quot; into English, and it was published in the UK by Orion Press in 1959. Also in 1959, Heinz Riedt, under close supervision by Levi, translated the book into German. Because one of Levi&#x27;s primary reasons for writing the book was to get the German people to realise what had been done in their name, and to accept at least partial responsibility, that translation was perhaps the most significant to him.

==== 1961–1974 ====
Levi began writing &quot;The Truce&quot; early in 1961. It was published in 1963, almost 16 years after his first book, and won the first annual Premio Campiello literary award that year. It is often published in one volume with &quot;If This Is a Man&quot;, because it covers his long return through eastern Europe from Auschwitz. Levi&#x27;s reputation was growing, and he regularly contributed articles to , the Turin newspaper. He worked to gain a reputation as a writer about subjects other than surviving Auschwitz.

In 1963, he suffered his first major bout of depression. At the time he had two young children, and a responsible job at a factory where accidents could and did have terrible consequences. He travelled and became a public figure. But the memory of what happened less than twenty years earlier still burned in his mind. Today, the link between such trauma and depression is better understood. Doctors prescribed several different drugs over the years, but they had variable efficacy and side effects.

In 1964, Levi collaborated with the state broadcaster RAI on a radio play based on &quot;If This Is a Man&quot; and, in 1966, with a theatre production.

Under the pen name of Damiano Malabaila, he published two volumes of science fiction short stories which explored ethical and philosophical questions. They imagined the effects on society of inventions which many would consider beneficial, but which, he saw, would have serious implications. Many of the stories from the two books (&quot;Natural Histories&quot;, 1966) and (&quot;Structural Defect&quot;, 1971) were later collected and published in English as &quot;The Sixth Day and Other Tales&quot;.

In 1974, Levi arranged to go into semi-retirement from SIVA in order to have more time to write. He also wanted to escape the burden of responsibility involved in managing the paint plant.

==== 1975–1987 ====
In 1975, a collection of Levi&#x27;s poetry was published under the title (&quot;The Bremen Beer Hall&quot;), which was published in English as &quot;Shema: Collected Poems&quot;.

He wrote two other highly praised memoirs, (&quot;Moments of Reprieve&quot;, 1978) and (&quot;The Periodic Table&quot;, 1975). &quot;Moments of Reprieve&quot; deals with characters he observed during imprisonment. &quot;The Periodic Table&quot; is a collection of mostly autobiographical short stories, and also includes two fictional stories that he wrote in 1941 while being employed at the asbestos mine in San Vittore. Each story is named after a chemical element and the subject matter of each story is related to that element. On 19 October 2006, the Royal Institution in London declared that &quot;The Periodic Table&quot; was the best science book ever written.

In 1977, at the age of 58, Levi retired as a part-time consultant at the SIVA paint factory to devote himself full-time to writing. Like all his books, &quot;La chiave a stella&quot; (1978), published in the US in 1986 as &quot;The Monkey Wrench&quot; and in the UK in 1987 as &quot;The Wrench&quot;, is difficult to categorize. Some reviews describe it as a collection of stories about work and workers, told by a narrator who resembles Levi. Others have called it a novel, created by the linked stories and characters. Set in the Fiat-run Russian company town of Togliattigrad, it portrays the engineer as a hero on whom others depend. The Piedmontese engineer Faussone travelled the world as an expert in erecting cranes and bridges. Most of the stories involve the solution of industrial problems by the use of troubleshooting skills, and many stories come from the author&#x27;s personal experience. The underlying philosophy is that pride in one&#x27;s work is necessary for fulfilment. &quot;The Wrench&quot; won the Strega Prize in 1979 and brought Levi a wider audience in Italy, though left-wing critics regretted that he did not describe the harsh working conditions on the assembly lines at Fiat.

In 1984, Levi published his only novel, &quot;If Not Now, When?&quot;—or his second novel, if &quot;The Monkey Wrench&quot; is counted. It traces the fortunes of a group of Jewish partisans behind German lines during World War II as they seek to survive and continue their fight against the occupier. With the ultimate goal of reaching Palestine to take part in the development of a Jewish national home, the partisan band reaches Poland and then German territory. There, the surviving members are officially received as displaced persons in territory held by the Western allies. Finally, they succeed in reaching Italy, on their way to Palestine. The novel won both the and the .

The book was inspired by events during Levi&#x27;s train journey home after liberation from the concentration camp, which was narrated in &quot;The Truce&quot;. At one point in the journey, a band of Zionists hitched their wagon to the refugee train. Levi was impressed by their strength, resolve, organisation and sense of purpose.

Levi became a major literary figure in Italy, and his books were translated into many other languages. &quot;The Truce&quot; became a standard text in Italian schools. In 1985, he flew to the United States for a 20-day speaking tour. Although he was accompanied by Lucia, the trip was very draining for him.

In the Soviet Union, his early works were not accepted by censors because he had portrayed Soviet soldiers as slovenly and disorderly rather than heroic. In Israel, a country formed partly by Jewish survivors who lived through horrors similar to those Levi described, many of his works were not translated and published until after his death.

In March 1985, he wrote the introduction to the re-publication of the autobiography of Rudolf Höss, who was commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp from 1940 to 1943. In it, he writes: &quot;It&#x27;s filled with evil ... and reading it is agony.&quot;

Also in 1985, a volume of his essays, previously published in , was published under the title (&quot;Other People&#x27;s Trades&quot;). Levi used to write the stories and hoard them, releasing them to at the rate of about one a week. The essays ranged from book reviews and ponderings about strange things in nature, to fictional short stories.

In 1986, his book (&quot;The Drowned and the Saved&quot;) was published. In it, he tries to analyse why people behaved the way they did at Auschwitz and why some survived whilst others perished. In his typical style, he makes no judgments but presents the evidence and asks the questions. For example, one essay examines what he calls &quot;the grey zone&quot;: those Jews who did the Germans&#x27; dirty work for them and kept the rest of the prisoners in line. He questioned what made a concert violinist behave as a callous taskmaster.

Also in 1986, a collection of short stories, previously published in , was assembled and published as , some of which were published in the English volume &quot;The Mirror Maker&quot;.

At the time of his death in April 1987, Levi was working on another selection of essays called &quot;The Double Bond&quot;, which took the form of letters to . The essays are very personal in nature, and approximately five or six chapters of the manuscript exist. Carole Angier, in her biography of Levi, describes how she tracked some of these essays down. She wrote that others were being kept from public view by Levi&#x27;s close friends, to whom he gave them, and they might have been destroyed.

==== Posthumous publications ====
In March 2007, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; published an English translation of Levi&#x27;s story , about a fictitious weapon that is fatal at close range but harmless more than a meter away. It originally appeared in his 1971 book but was published in English for the first time by &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;.

&quot;A Tranquil Star&quot;, a collection of seventeen stories translated into English by Ann Goldstein and Alessandra Bastagli was published in April 2007.

In 2015, Penguin published &quot;The Complete Works of Primo Levi&quot;, ed. Ann Goldstein. This is the first time that Levi&#x27;s entire oeuvre has been translated into English.

=== Death ===
Levi died on 11 April 1987 after a fall from the interior landing of his third-story apartment in Turin to the ground floor below. The coroner ruled his death a suicide. Three of his biographers (Angier, Thomson and Anissimov) agreed, but other writers (including at least one who knew him personally) questioned that determination.

In his later life, Levi indicated that he was suffering from depression. Factors in that likely included responsibility for his elderly mother and mother-in-law, with whom he was living, and lingering traumatic memories of his experiences. According to the chief rabbi of Rome Elio Toaff, Levi telephoned him for the first time ten minutes before the incident. Levi said he found it impossible to look at his mother, who was ill with cancer, without recalling the faces of people stretched out on benches in Auschwitz. The Nobel laureate and fellow Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel said, at the time, &quot;Primo Levi died at Auschwitz forty years later.&quot;

However, several of Levi&#x27;s friends and associates have argued otherwise. The Oxford sociologist Diego Gambetta noted that Levi left no suicide note, nor any other indication that he was considering suicide. Documents and testimony suggested that he had plans for both the short- and longer-term at the time. In the days before his death, he had complained to his physician of dizziness due to an operation he had undergone some three weeks earlier. After visiting the apartment complex, Gambetta suggested that Levi lost his balance and fell accidentally. The Nobel laureate Rita Levi-Montalcini, a close friend of Levi, agreed. &quot;As a chemical engineer,&quot; she said, &quot;he might have chosen a better way [of exiting the world] than jumping into a narrow stairwell with the risk of remaining paralyzed.&quot;

== Legacy ==
=== Holocaust writing ===
Levi is frequently referred to as a &quot;Holocaust writer&quot;, a label he disliked. However, he is considered to have authored some of the most important writing about the Holocaust, which has greatly contributed to the memory and understanding of that disaster. Philip Roth eulogized him as someone who &quot;set out systematically to remember the German hell on earth, steadfastly to think it through, and then to render it comprehensible in lucid, unpretentious prose&quot;. Martin Amis has credited Levi&#x27;s work with assisting him in writing his own novel, &quot;The Zone of Interest&quot;, calling him &quot;the visionary of the Holocaust, its presiding spirit and the most perceptive of all writers on this subject.&quot;

=== Posthumous honors ===
* In 1995, five health and human rights organizations established the Primo Levi Center in Paris to provide services to torture survivors. The center was named for Levi because his name is &quot;synonymous with the refusal of inhuman, cruel and degrading treatment&quot;. 
* The Primo Levi Center, a non-profit organisation dedicated to studying the history and culture of Italian Jewry, was established in New York City in 2003.
* In 2008, the City of Turin and other partners established the International Primo Levi Studies Center to preserve and promote Levi&#x27;s legacy.
* Beginning in 2017, the Primo Levi Prize has been awarded by the German Chemical Society and the Italian Chemical Society to honor chemists for their commitment to human rights.
* In 2019, Levi&#x27;s 100th birthday was commemorated throughout the world, including the United States, Portugal, and Italy.
* The SIVA factory has been turned into the Museo della Chimica, a chemistry museum for children. Levi&#x27;s former office now holds an exhibit about his life.

=== In popular culture ===

* In Lavie Tidhar&#x27;s novel, &quot;A Man Lies Dreaming&quot;, the protagonist encounters Levi and Ka-Tzetnik in Auschwitz and witnesses them discuss how they should write about the Holocaust. Levi says they should be &quot;accurate and dispassionate&quot; while Ka-Tzetnik advocates &quot;the language of [...] pulp&quot;.
*In the pilot episode of &quot;Black Earth Rising&quot;, Rwandan genocide survivor Kate Ashby has a therapy session addressing her survivors&#x27; guilt and suicide attempt. She tells her therapist that she has read the Primo Levi book he&#x27;d assigned her and that if she chooses to attempt suicide, she&#x27;ll &quot;take a leaf out of Mr Levi&#x27;s book and jump straight out the window.&quot;
*The last track on &quot;The Noise&quot; by Peter Hammill is entitled &quot;Primo on the Parapet&quot;.

== Views ==

=== Nazi death camps versus Soviet gulags ===
Levi vigorously repudiated historical revisionist attitudes in German historiography that emerged in the &quot;Historikerstreit&quot;, led by the works of people like Andreas Hillgruber and Ernst Nolte, who drew parallels between Nazism and Stalinism. Levi rejected the idea that the labor camp system depicted in Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; and that of the Nazi (; see Nazi concentration camps) were comparable. The death rate in Stalin&#x27;s gulags was 30% at worst, he wrote, while in the extermination camps, he estimated it to be 90–98%.

His view was that the Nazi death camps and the attempted annihilation of the Jews were a horror unique in history because the goal was the complete destruction of a race by one that saw itself as superior. He noted that it was highly organized and mechanized, and entailed the degradation of Jews to the point of using their ashes as materials for paths.

The purpose of the Nazi extermination camps was not the same as the purpose of Stalin&#x27;s &quot;gulags&quot;, Levi wrote in an appendix to &quot;If This Is a Man&quot;, though it is a &quot;lugubrious comparison between two models of hell.&quot; The goal of the was the extermination of the Jewish race in Europe, and no one could renounce Judaism, because the Nazis considered Jews a racial group rather than a religious group. Levi, along with most of Turin&#x27;s Jewish intellectuals, had not been religiously observant before World War II, but the Italian racial laws and the Nazi camps impressed his identity as a Jew upon him. Of the many children who were deported to the camps, almost all of them were murdered.

=== German people ===
According to biographer Ian Thomson, Levi intentionally excluded from &quot;If This Is a Man&quot; any experiences with Germans who helped him and included &quot;collective condemnations, coloured by the author&#x27;s rage, of the German people&quot;. However, Levi&#x27;s opinion of Germans improved through his friendship with a German woman named Hety Schmitt-Maas. Her father had lost his job and she had been expelled from school due to their anti-Nazi beliefs. For 17 years, Levi and Schmitt-Maas discussed &quot;their shared hatred of Nazism&quot; together in their letters to each other until Schmitt-Maas died in 1983.

Almost forty years after &quot;If This Is A Man&quot; was published, Levi stated that he did not hate German people because hating a whole ethnic group would be too much like Nazism. However, he also stated that he did not forgive &quot;the culprits&quot;. According to Levi, the German people largely knew about the concentration camps but did not know the extent of the atrocities occurring there. However, &quot;most Germans didn’t know because they didn’t want to know. Because, indeed, they wanted not to know&quot;.

<doc id="39430" wikidata="Q58155" url="?curid=39430" title="Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse">
<text>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are figures in the Book of Revelation in the New Testament of the Bible, a piece of apocalypse literature attributed to John of Patmos, and generally regarded as dating to about AD 95. Similar allusions are contained in the Old Testament books of Ezekiel and Zechariah, written about six centuries prior. Though the text only provides a name for the fourth horseman, subsequent commentary often identifies them as personifications of Conquest (Zelos/Zelus), War (Ares/Mars), Famine (Limos/Fames), and Death (Thanatos/Mors or Moros/Fatum).

Revelation 6 tells of a book or scroll in God&#x27;s right hand that is sealed with seven seals. The Lamb of God/Lion of Judah opens the first four of the seven seals, which summons four beings that ride out on white, red, black, and pale horses. All of the horsemen save for Death are portrayed as being human in appearance.

In John&#x27;s revelation the first horseman rides a white horse, carries a bow, and is given a crown as a figure of conquest, perhaps invoking pestilence, or the Antichrist. The second carries a sword and rides a red horse as the creator of (civil) war, conflict, and strife. The third, a food merchant, rides a black horse symbolizing famine and carries the scales. The fourth and final horse is pale, upon it rides Death, accompanied by Hades. &quot;They were given authority over a quarter of the Earth, to kill with sword, famine and plague, and by means of the beasts of the Earth.&quot;
Christianity typically interprets the Four Horsemen as a vision of harbingers of the Last Judgment, setting a divine end-time upon the world.

==White Horse==

The above passage is a common English translation of the rider of the White Horse (sometimes referred to as the White Rider). He is thought to carry a bow (Greek τόξον, &quot;tóxon&quot;) and wear a victor&#x27;s crown (Greek στέφανος, &quot;stéphanos&quot;).

According to the &quot;Interpretātiō Graecǎ&quot;, he is Zelos (Ζῆλος, &quot;Zêlos&quot; (latinized as Zēlus), literally &quot;Zeal&quot; or &quot;Jealousy&quot;), daimon/deity of conquest and glory.

===As Christ, the Gospel, or the Holy Spirit===
For the broad historical interpretation of Christ as the rider of the white horse, it is to be understood that the Antichrist does not appear until the opening of the sixth seal. Events in world history since the founding of Christianity were interpreted as &quot;horses&quot; up to the sixth seal event. Therefore, this interpretation can be seen as either partially preterist, or an instance of dual fulfillment.

In the New Testament, the Book of Mark indicates that the advance of the gospel may precede and foretell the apocalypse. The colour white also tends to represent righteousness in the Bible, and Christ is portrayed as a conqueror in other instances.

Besides Christ, the Horseman could represent the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit was understood to have come upon the Apostles at Pentecost after Jesus departed Earth. The appearance of the Lion in Revelation 5 shows the triumphant arrival of Jesus in Heaven, and the first Horseman may represent the sending of the Holy Spirit by Jesus and the advance of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

===As the Antichrist===
In 1866, when C. F. Zimpel defended the hypothesis that the first horseman was the Antichrist (and more precisely, according to him, Napoleon Bonaparte). The Antichrist interpretation later found champions in the United States, such as R. F. Franklin in 1898 and W. C. Stevens in 1928. It remains popular in evangelical circles today, for example with Pastor Billy Graham, for whom the horseman represented the Antichrist or false prophets in general.

===As Roman Empire prosperity===
In Edward Bishop Elliott&#x27;s interpretation, the Four Horsemen represent a prophecy of the Roman Empire&#x27;s subsequent history; the horse&#x27;s white colour signifies triumph, prosperity, and health in the Roman political body. For the next 80 or 90 years, succeeding the banishment of the prophet John to the island of Patmos and covering the successive reigns of the emperors Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the two Antonines (Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius), a golden age of prosperity, union, civil liberty and good government unstained with civil blood unfolded. The agents of this prosperity, personified by the rider of the white horse, are these five emperors wearing crowns, who reigned with absolute authority and power under the guidance of virtue and wisdom, the armies being restrained by their firm and gentle hands.

According to this interpretation, this period in Roman history, both at its commencement and close, illustrated the empire&#x27;s glory where its limits were extended, though not without occasional wars, which were always uniformly triumphant on the frontiers. The triumphs of Emperor Trajan, a Roman Alexander, added to the empire Dacia, Armenia, Mesopotamia, and other provinces during the first 20 years of the period, which deepened the impression on the minds of the barbarians of the invincibility of the Roman Empire. The Roman war progressed triumphantly into the invader&#x27;s territory, and the total overthrow of those people successfully ended the Parthian war. Roman conquest is demonstrated even in the most mighty of these wars: the Marcomannic Wars, a succession of victories under the second Antonine, unleashed on the German barbarians, who were driven into their forests and reduced to Roman submission.

===As war===
In some commentaries, the white Horseman symbolizes war, which may be decently exercised on moral grounds, hence the white colour. The red Horseman (see below) specifically symbolizes civil war.

===As infectious disease===
Under another interpretation, the first Horseman is called Pestilence and is associated with infectious disease and plague. It appears at least as early as 1906 in the Jewish Encyclopedia. This particular interpretation is common in popular culture references to the Four Horsemen.

The origin of this interpretation is unclear. Some translations of the Bible mention &quot;plague&quot; (e.g. the New International Version) or &quot;pestilence&quot; (e.g. the Revised Standard Version) in connection with the riders in the passage following the introduction of the fourth rider; cf. &quot;They were given power over a fourth of the Earth to kill by sword, famine, plague, and by the wild beasts of the Earth.&quot; in the NASB. However, the original Greek does not use the word for &quot;plague&quot; or &quot;pestilence&quot; here, simply &quot;death&quot; (θᾰ́νᾰτος, &quot;thánatos&quot;). The use of &quot;pestilence&quot; was likely drawn from other parts of the Book of Revelation and included here as another form of death. Also, whether this passage refers to the fourth rider only or the four riders as a whole is a matter of debate.

Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, in his 1916 novel &quot;The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot; (filmed in 1921 and 1962), provides an early example of this interpretation, writing, &quot;The horseman on the white horse was clad in a showy and barbarous attire. . . . While his horse continued galloping, he was bending his bow in order to spread pestilence abroad. At his back swung the brass quiver filled with poisoned arrows, containing the germs of all diseases&quot;.

==Red Horse==

The rider of the second horse is often taken to represent War (he is often pictured holding a sword upwards as though ready for battle) or mass slaughter. His horse&#x27;s colour is red (πυρρός, &quot;purrhós&quot; from , fire), and in some translations, the colour is specifically a &quot;fiery&quot; red. The colour red, as well as the rider&#x27;s possession of a great sword (μάχαιρα, &quot;mákhaira&quot;), suggests blood that is to be spilled. As seen in heraldry, the sword held upward by the second Horseman may represent war or a declaration of war. In military symbolism, swords held upward, especially crossed swords held upward, signify war and entering into battle (see, for example, the historical and modern images and the coat of arms of Joan of Arc). 

The second Horseman represents civil war as opposed to the war of conquest that the first Horseman is said to bring. Other commentators have suggested that it might also represent the persecution of Christians.

According to the &quot;Interpretātiō Graecǎ&quot;, he is Ares (Ἄρης, &quot;Árēs&quot; (latinized as Ărēs), literally &quot;Bane&quot; or &quot;War&quot;), spirit/god of war and battle.

===As empire division===

According to Edward Bishop Elliott&#x27;s interpretation of the Four Horsemen as symbolic prophecy of the history of the Roman Empire, the second seal is opened and the Roman nation that experienced joy, prosperity, and triumph is made subject to the red horse which depicts war and bloodshed—civil war. Peace left the Roman Earth, resulting in the killing of one another as insurrection crept into and permeated the Empire, beginning shortly into the reign of Emperor Commodus.

Elliott points out that Commodus, who had nothing to wish for and everything to enjoy, that beloved son of Marcus Aurelius who ascended the throne with neither competitor to remove nor enemies to punish, became the slave of his attendants who gradually corrupted his mind.

Elliott further recites that, after the death of Commodus, a most turbulent period lasting 92 years unfolded, during which time 32 emperors and 27 pretenders to the Empire hurled each other from the throne by incessant civil warfare. The sword was a natural universal badge, among the Romans, of the military profession. The apocalyptic figure armed with a great sword indicated an undue authority and unnatural use of it. Military men in power, whose vocation was war and weapon the sword, rose by it and also fell. The unrestrained military, no longer subject to the Senate, transformed the Empire into a system of pure military despotism.

==Black Horse==


The third Horseman rides a black horse and is popularly understood to be Famine, as the Horseman carries a pair of balances or weighing scales (Greek ζυγόν, &quot;zugón&quot;), indicating the way that bread would have been weighed during a famine. The rider is typically portrayed as an emaciated man. Other authors interpret the third Horseman as the &quot;Lord as a Law-Giver&quot;, holding Scales of Justice. In the passage, it is read that the indicated price of grain is about ten times normal (thus the famine interpretation popularity), with an entire day&#x27;s wages (a denarius) buying enough wheat for only one person (one &quot;choenix&quot;, about 1.1 litres), or enough of the less nutritious barley for three, so that workers would struggle to feed their families. In the Gospels, the denarius is repeatedly mentioned as a monetary unit; for example, the denarius was the pay of a soldier for one day, and the day labor of a seasonal worker in the harvesting of grapes is also valued at one denarius (). Thus, it is probably a fact that with the approach of the Apocalypse, the most necessary food will rise in price greatly and the wages earned per day will be enough only for the minimum subsistence for the same day and nothing more.

Of the Four Horsemen, the black horse and its rider are the only ones whose appearance is accompanied by vocalization. John hears a voice, unidentified but coming from among the four living creatures, that speaks of the prices of wheat and barley, saying, &quot;and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine&quot;. This suggests that the black horse&#x27;s famine is to drive up the price of grain but leave oil and wine supplies unaffected (though out of reach of the ordinary worker). One explanation is that grain crops would have been more naturally susceptible to famine years or locust plagues than olive trees and grapevines, which root more deeply.

The statement might also suggest a continuing abundance of luxuries for the wealthy, while staples, such as bread, are scarce, though not completely depleted; such selective scarcity may result from injustice and the deliberate production of luxury crops for the wealthy over grain, as would have happened during the time the Book of Revelation was written. Alternatively, the preservation of oil and wine could symbolize the preservation of the Christian faithful, who use oil and wine in their sacraments.

According to the &quot;Interpretātiō Graecǎ&quot;, he is Limos (Λῑμός, &quot;Līmós&quot; (latinized as Līmus), literally &quot;Hunger&quot;, &quot;Starvation&quot; or &quot;Famine&quot;), personification/deity of famine.

===As imperial oppression===
According to Edward Bishop Elliott&#x27;s interpretation, through this third seal, the black horse is unleashed, representing aggravated distress and mourning. The balance in the rider&#x27;s hand is not associated with a man weighing out bread for his family but with buying and selling corn and other grains. During the time of the apostle John&#x27;s exile in Patmos, the balance was commonly a symbol of justice since it was used to weigh grains for a set price. The balance of justice held in the hand of the rider of the black horse signified the aggravation of the other previous evil, with the bloodstained red of the Roman aspect morphing into the darker blackness of distress. The black horse rider is instructed not to harm the oil and the wine, which signifies that this scarcity should not fall upon the superfluities, such as oil and wine, which men can live without, but upon the necessities of life—bread.

This interpretation also borrows from Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, which claims the Roman Empire suffered as a result of excessive taxation of its citizens, particularly during the reign of Emperor Caracalla, whom history has primarily remembered as a cruel tyrant and among the worst of the Roman emperors. Under the necessity of gratifying the greed and excessive lifestyle which Caracalla had excited in the army, old as well as new taxes, were at the same time levied in the provinces. The land tax, taxes for services, and heavy contributions of corn, wine, oil, and meat were exacted from the provinces for court, army, and capital use.

According to Gibbon, this was exacerbated by the rise to power of Emperor Maximin, who &quot;attacked the public property at length&quot;. Every city of the empire was destined to purchase corn for the multitudes, as well as supply expenses for the games. By the Emperor&#x27;s authority, the whole mass of wealth was confiscated for use by the Imperial treasury—temples &quot;stripped of their most valuable offerings of gold, silver [and statues] which were melted down and coined into money&quot;.

==Pale Horse==

The fourth and final Horseman is named Death (Greek: Θᾰ́νᾰτος, &quot;Thánatos&quot;, Latin: &quot;Mŏrs&quot; or &quot;Thanatus&quot;).

Death, known in Latin as Mŏrs and in Greek as Thánatos (Θᾰ́νᾰτος), of all the riders, he is the only one to whom the text itself explicitly gives a name. Unlike the other three, he is not described as carrying a weapon or other object, instead, he is followed by &quot;Hades&quot; (Greek: ᾍδης, Hā́idēs, latinized as Hādēs), which here refers not to the pagan god of death and his abode in Greek mythology, but simply to the place of the dead in the Greek language, and which is called &quot;Īnfernus&quot; (&quot;[the] Underworld&quot;, a clipping of īnfernus lŏcus, &quot;[the] lower place&quot;) in Latin. However, illustrations commonly depict him carrying a scythe, sword, or another implement, he is no different than typical portrayals of Death, and is the only horseman who doesn’t appear to be a human.

The colour of Death&#x27;s horse is written as &quot;pàllidus&quot; in Latin and as (&quot;khlōrós&quot;, latinized as &quot;chlōrus&quot;) in the original Koine Greek, which can mean either green/greenish-yellow or pale/pallid in both languages. The colour is often translated as &quot;pale&quot;, though &quot;ashen&quot;, &quot;pale green&quot;, and &quot;yellowish green&quot; are other possible interpretations (the Greek word is the root of &quot;chlorophyll&quot; and &quot;chlorine&quot;). Based on the uses of the word in ancient Greek medical literature, several scholars suggest that the colour reflects the sickly pallor of a corpse. In some modern artistic depictions, the horse is distinctly green.

The verse beginning with &quot;they were given power over a fourth of the Earth&quot; is generally taken as referring to Death and Hades, although some commentators see it as applying to all four horsemen.

According to the &quot;Interpretātiō Graecǎ&quot;, he is Moros (Μόρος, &quot;Móros&quot; (latinized as Mŏrus), literally &quot;Fate&quot; or &quot;Doom&quot;), personification/deity of impending doom.

===Destroying an empire===
This fourth, pale horse, was the personification of Death, with Hades following him, jaws open and receiving the victims slain by Death. Death&#x27;s commission was to kill upon the Roman Earth with all of the four judgments of God—with sword, famine, pestilence, and wild beasts. The deadly pale and livid appearance displays a hue symptomatic of approaching empire dissolution. According to Edward Bishop Elliott, an era in Roman history commencing within about 15 years after the death of Severus Alexander (in AD 235)&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica/Alexander Severus&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; strongly marks every point of this terrible emblem.

Edward Gibbon speaks of a period from the celebration of the great secular games by the Emperor Philip to the death of Gallienus (in AD 268)&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica/Gallienus&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as the 20 years of shame and misfortune, of confusion and calamity, as a time when the ruined empire approached the last and fatal moment of its dissolution. Every instant of time in every province of the Roman world was afflicted by military tyrants and barbarous invaders—the sword from within and without.

According to Elliott, famine, the inevitable consequence of carnage and oppression, which demolished the present crop as well as the hope of future harvests, produced the environment for an epidemic of diseases, the effects of scanty and unwholesome food. That furious plague (the Plague of Cyprian), which raged from 250 to 265, continued without interruption in every province, city and almost every family in the empire. During a portion of this time, 5000 people died daily in Rome; and many towns that had escaped the attacks of barbarians were entirely depopulated.

For a time in the late 260s, the strength of Aurelian crushed the enemies of Rome, yet after his assassination a certain amount of them revived. While the Goths had been destroyed for almost a century and the Empire reunited, the Sassanid Persians were uncowed in the East and, during the following year, hosts of central Asian Alani spread themselves over Pontus, Cappadocia, Cilicia, and Galatia, etching their course by the flames of cities and villages they pillaged.

As for the wild beasts of the Earth, according to Elliott, it is a well-known law of nature that they quickly occupy the scenes of waste and depopulation—where the reign of man fails and the reign of beasts begins. After the reign of Gallienus and 20 or 30 years had passed, the multiplication of the animals had risen to such an extent in parts of the empire that they made it a &#x27;crying evil&#x27;.

One notable point of apparent difference between the prophecy and history might seem to be expressly limited to the fourth part of the Roman Earth, but in the history of the period, the devastation of the pale horse extended over all. The fourth seal prophecy seems to mark the malignant climax of the evils of the two preceding seals, to which no such limitation is attached. Turning to a reading in Jerome&#x27;s Latin Vulgate which reads &quot;over the four parts of the Earth&quot;, it requires that the Roman Empire should have some kind of quadripartition. Dividing from the central or Italian fourth, three great divisions of the Empire separated into the West, East, and Illyricum under Posthumus, Aureolus, and Zenobia respectively—divisions that were later legitimized by Diocletian.

Diocletian ended this long period of anarchy, but the succession of civil wars and invasions caused much suffering, disorder and crime, which brought the empire into a state of moral lethargy from which it never recovered. After the plague had abated, the empire suffered from general distress, and its condition was very much like that which followed after the Black Death of the Middle Ages. Talent and art had become extinct in proportion to the desolation of the world.

==Interpretations==


===Christological interpretation===
Before the Reformation and the woodcut by Albrecht Dürer, the usual and more influential commentaries of the Book of Revelation thought there was only one horseman riding successively these four horses, who was the Christ himself. So did some medieval illuminations, and after that some modern commentators: Oecumenius, a Greek exegete writing in the sixth century, Berengaudus a French Benedictine monk of Ferrières Abbey at the same period, Luis del Alcázar a Spanish Jesuit in 1612, Benito Arias Montano, a Spanish Orientalist, in 1622, Jacques de Bordes, a French capuchin in 1639, Emanuel Swedenborg a Swedish theologian in 1766.

===Prophetic interpretation===
Some Christians interpret the Horsemen as a prophecy of a future Tribulation, during which many on Earth will die as a result of multiple catastrophes. The Four Horsemen are the first in a series of &quot;Seal&quot; judgments. This is when God will judge the Earth, and is giving humans a chance to repent before they die. A new beautiful Earth is created for all the people who are faithful to Him and accept him as their Savior.

John Walvoord, a premillennialist, believed the Seals will be opened during the Great Tribulation and coincides with the arrival of the Antichrist as the first horseman, a global war as the second horseman, an economic collapse as the third horseman, and the general die-off of one quarter of the World&#x27;s population as the fourth horseman; which is followed by a global dictatorship under the Antichrist and the rest of the plagues.

===Historicist interpretation===
According to E. B. Elliott, the first seal, as revealed to John by the angel, was to signify what was to happen soon after John seeing the visions in Patmos, and that the second, third, and fourth seals in like manner were to have commencing dates each in chronological sequence following the preceding seal. Its general subject is the decline and fall, after a previous prosperous era, of the Empire of Heathen Rome. The first four seals of Revelation, represented by four horses and horsemen, are fixed to events, or changes, within the Roman Earth.

===Preterist interpretation===
Some modern scholars interpret Revelation from a preterist point of view, arguing that its prophecy and imagery apply only to the events of the first century of Christian history. In this school of thought, Conquest, the white horse&#x27;s rider, is sometimes identified as a symbol of Parthian forces: Conquest carries a bow, and the Parthian Empire was at that time known for its mounted warriors and their skill with bow and arrow. Parthians were also particularly associated with white horses. Some scholars specifically point to Vologases I, a Parthian shah who clashed with the Roman Empire and won one significant battle in AD 62.

Revelation&#x27;s historical context may also influence the depiction of the black horse and its rider, Famine. In AD 92, the Roman emperor Domitian attempted to curb excessive growth of grapevines and encourage grain cultivation instead, but there was a major popular backlash against this effort, and it was abandoned. Famine&#x27;s mission to make wheat and barley scarce but &quot;hurt not the oil and the wine&quot; could be an allusion to this episode. The red horse and its rider, who take peace from the Earth, might represent the prevalence of civil strife at the time Revelation was written; internecine conflict ran rampant in the Roman Empire during and just prior to the 1st century AD.

===Latter-day Saint interpretation===
Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe the prophet, Joseph Smith, revealed that the book described by John &quot;contains the revealed will, mysteries, and the works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this Earth during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence&quot; and that the seals describe these things for the seven thousand years of the Earth&#x27;s temporal existence, each seal representing 1,000 years.

About the first seal and the white horse, LDS Apostle Bruce R. McConkie taught, &quot;The most transcendent happenings involved Enoch and his ministry. What John saw was not the establishment of Zion and its removal to heavenly spheres, but the unparalleled wars in which Enoch, as a general over the armies of the saints, &#x27;went forth conquering and to conquer&#x27; Revelation 6:2; see also Moses 7:13–18.&quot; The second seal and the red horse represent the period from approximately 3,000 BC to 2,000 BC, including the wickedness and violence leading to the Great Flood.

The third seal and black horse describe the period of ancient Joseph, son of Israel, who was sold into Egypt, and the famines that swept that period (see Genesis 41–42; Abraham 1:29–30; 2:1, 17, 21). The fourth seal and the pale horse are interpreted to represent the thousand years leading up to the birth of Jesus Christ, both the physical death brought about by great warring empires and the spiritual death through apostasy among the Lord&#x27;s chosen people.

===Other interpretations===
Artwork which shows the Horsemen as a group, such as the famous woodcut by Albrecht Dürer, suggests an interpretation where all four horsemen represent different aspects of the same tribulation.

American Protestant Evangelical interpreters regularly see ways in which the horsemen, and Revelation in general, speak to contemporary events. Some who believe Revelation applies to modern times can interpret the horses based on the various ways their colours are used. Red, for example, often represents Communism, the white horse and rider with a crown representing Catholicism, Black has been used as a symbol of Capitalism, while Green represents the rise of Islam. Pastor Irvin Baxter Jr. of Endtime Ministries espoused such a belief.

Some equate the Four Horsemen with the angels of the four winds. (See Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel, angels often associated with four cardinal directions).

Some speculate that when the imagery of the Six Seals is compared to other eschatological descriptions throughout the Bible, the themes of the horsemen draw remarkable similarity to the events of the Olivet Discourse. The signs of the approaching end of the world are likened to birth pains, indicating that they would occur more frequently and with greater intensity the nearer the event of Christ&#x27;s return. With this perspective the horsemen represent the rise of false religions, false prophets, and false messiahs; the increase of wars and rumours of wars; the escalation of natural disasters and famines; and the growth of persecution, martyrdom, betrayal, and loss of faith.

According to Anatoly Fomenko, a new chronologist, the Book of Revelation is largely astrological in nature. The &#x27;Four Horsemen&#x27; represent the planets Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

==Other Biblical references==

===Zechariah===
The Book of Zechariah twice mentions coloured horses; in the first passage there are three colours (red, speckled/brown, and white), and in the second there are four teams of horses (red, black, white, and finally dappled/&quot;grisled and bay&quot;) pulling chariots. The second set of horses are referred to as &quot;the four spirits of heaven, going out from standing in the presence of the Lord of the whole world.&quot; They are described as patrolling the Earth and keeping it peaceful. It may be assumed by some Christian interpretations that when the tribulation begins, the peace is taken away, so their job is to terrify the places in which they patrol.

===Ezekiel===
The four living creatures of Revelation 4:6–8 are written similarly to the four living creatures in Ezekiel 1:5–12. In Revelation, each of the living creatures summons a horseman, where in Ezekiel the living creatures follow wherever the spirit leads, without turning.

In Ezekiel 14:21, the Lord enumerates His &quot;four disastrous acts of judgment&quot; (ESV), sword, famine, wild beasts, and pestilence, against the idolatrous elders of Israel. A symbolic interpretation of the Four Horsemen links the riders to these judgments, or the similar judgments in 6:11–12.

<text>New Scientist is a popular science magazine covering all aspects of science and technology. Based in London, it publishes weekly English-language editions in the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia. An editorially separate organisation publishes a monthly Dutch-language edition. First published on 22 November 1956, &quot;New Scientist&quot; has been available in online form since 1996.

Sold in retail outlets (paper edition) and on subscription (paper and/or online), the magazine covers news, features, reviews and commentary on science, technology and their implications. &quot;New Scientist&quot; also publishes speculative articles, ranging from the technical to the philosophical.

&quot;New Scientist&quot; was acquired by Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) in March 2021.

==History==
===Ownership===
The magazine was founded in 1956 by Tom Margerison, Max Raison and Nicholas Harrison as &quot;The New Scientist&quot;, with Issue 1 on 22 November 1956, priced at one shilling (). An article in the magazine&#x27;s 10th anniversary issues provides anecdotes on the founding of the magazine. The British monthly science magazine &quot;Science Journal&quot;, published from 1965 until 1971, was merged with &quot;New Scientist&quot; to form &quot;New Scientist and Science Journal&quot;. In 1970, the Reed Group, which became Reed Elsevier, acquired &quot;New Scientist&quot; when it merged with IPC Magazines. Reed retained the magazine when it sold most of its consumer titles in a management buyout to what is now TI Media. In April 2017 &quot;New Scientist&quot; changed ownership when RELX Group, formerly known as Reed Elsevier, sold the magazine to Kingston Acquisitions, a group established by Sir Bernard Gray, Louise Rogers and Matthew O&#x27;Sullivan to acquire &quot;New Scientist&quot;. Kingston Acquisitions then renamed itself New Scientist Ltd. The &quot;New Scientist&quot; was subsequently sold to the Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) for £70 million in March 2021; DMGT guaranteed the magazine&#x27;s editorial independence, and ruled out staff cuts and the sharing of editorial content.

In December 2021, DMGT announced that both &quot;New Scientist&quot; and the DMGT-owned daily &quot;i&quot; newspaper would be moved to a new division of the company, to be called Harmsworth Media.

===General history===
Originally, the cover of &quot;New Scientist&quot; listed articles in plain text. Initially, page numbering followed academic practice with sequential numbering for each quarterly volume. So, for example, the first page of an issue in March could be 649 instead of 1. Later issues numbered issues separately. From the beginning of 1961 &quot;The&quot; was dropped from the title. From 1965, the front cover was illustrated. Until the 1970s, colour was not used except on the cover.

Since its first issue, &quot;New Scientist&quot; has written about the applications of science, through its coverage of technology. For example, the first issue included an article &quot;Where next from Calder Hall?&quot; on the future of nuclear power in the UK, a topic that it has covered throughout its history. In 1964, there was a regular &quot;Science in British Industry&quot; section with several items.

Throughout most of its history, &quot;New Scientist&quot; has published cartoons as light relief and comment on the news, with contributions from regulars such as Mike Peyton and David Austin. The &quot;Grimbledon Down&quot; comic strip, by cartoonist Bill Tidy, appeared from 1970 to 1994. The Ariadne pages in &quot;New Scientist&quot; commented on the lighter side of science and technology and included contributions from David E. H. Jones, Daedalus. The fictitious inventor devised plausible but impractical and humorous inventions, often developed by the (fictitious) DREADCO corporation. Daedalus later moved to &quot;Nature&quot;.

In the first half of 2013, the international circulation of &quot;New Scientist&quot; averaged 125,172. While this was a 4.3% reduction on the previous year&#x27;s figure, it was a much smaller reduction in circulation than many mainstream magazines of similar or greater circulation. UK circulation fell by 3.2% in 2014, but stronger international sales increased the circulation to 129,585.

A monthly Dutch edition of &quot;New Scientist&quot; was launched in June 2015. It replaced the former &quot; (NWT)&quot; magazine, adopting its staff and subscribers. The editorially independent magazine is published by Veen Media. It contains mainly translations of articles in the English-language edition, but also its own articles. These are typically focused on research in the Netherlands and Belgium, the main countries where it is purchased.

===Modern format===
In the 21st century, until May 2019, &quot;New Scientist&quot; contained the following sections: Leader, News (Upfront), Technology, Opinion (interviews, point-of-view articles and letters), Features (including cover article), CultureLab (book and event reviews), Feedback (humour), The Last Word (questions and answers) and Jobs &amp; Careers. A Tom Gauld cartoon appears on the Letters page. A readers&#x27; letters section discusses recent articles and discussions also take place on the website. Readers contribute observations on examples of pseudoscience to Feedback, and offer questions and answers on scientific and technical topics to Last Word. &quot;New Scientist&quot; has produced a series of books compiled from contributions to Last Word.

From issue 3228 of 4 May 2019, &quot;New Scientist&quot; introduced a &quot;slightly updated design, with ... a fresher, brighter feel&quot;. A dedicated &quot;Views&quot; section was added between news reports and in-depth features, including readers&#x27; letters, comment, and reviews on science, culture and society. Regular columnists were introduced, and columns in the culture pages. The light-hearted &quot;Back Pages&quot; includes the long-standing Feedback and The Last Word, puzzles, and a Q&amp;A section.

Online readership takes various forms. Overall global views of an online database of over 100,000 articles are 10.8m by 7m unique users according to Google Analytics, . On social media there are 3.5m+ Twitter followers, 3.5m+ Facebook followers and 100,000+ Instagram followers .

==Criticism==

=== Greg Egan&#x27;s criticism of the EmDrive article ===
In September 2006, &quot;New Scientist&quot; was criticised by science fiction writer Greg Egan, who wrote that &quot;a sensationalist bent and a lack of basic knowledge by its writers&quot; was making the magazine&#x27;s coverage sufficiently unreliable &quot;to constitute a real threat to the public understanding of science&quot;. In particular, Egan found himself &quot;gobsmacked by the level of scientific illiteracy&quot; in the magazine&#x27;s coverage of Roger Shawyer&#x27;s &quot;electromagnetic drive&quot;, where &quot;New Scientist&quot; allowed the publication of &quot;meaningless double-talk&quot; designed to bypass a fatal objection to Shawyer&#x27;s proposed space drive, namely that it violates the law of conservation of momentum. Egan urged others to write to &quot;New Scientist&quot; and pressure the magazine to raise its standards, instead of &quot;squandering the opportunity that the magazine&#x27;s circulation and prestige provides&quot;. The editor of &quot;New Scientist&quot;, then Jeremy Webb, replied defending the article, saying that it is &quot;an ideas magazine—that means writing about hypotheses as well as theories&quot;.

=== &quot;Darwin was wrong&quot; cover ===
In January 2009, &quot;New Scientist&quot; ran a cover with the title &quot;Darwin was wrong&quot;. The actual story stated that specific details of Darwin&#x27;s evolution theory had been shown incorrectly, mainly the shape of phylogenetic trees of interrelated species, which should be represented as a web instead of a tree. Some evolutionary biologists who actively oppose the intelligent design movement thought the cover was both sensationalist and damaging to the scientific community.

<text>Stephen Arthur Cook (born December 14, 1939) is an American-Canadian computer scientist and mathematician who has made significant contributions to the fields of complexity theory and proof complexity. He is a university professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, Department of Computer Science and Department of Mathematics.

He is considered one of the forefathers of computational complexity theory.

==Biography==

Cook received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1961 from the University of Michigan, and his master&#x27;s degree and PhD from Harvard University, respectively in 1962 and 1966, from the Mathematics Department. He joined the University of California, Berkeley, mathematics department in 1966 as an assistant professor, and stayed there until 1970 when he was denied reappointment. In a speech celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Berkeley electrical engineering and computer sciences department, fellow Turing Award winner and Berkeley professor Richard Karp said that, &quot;It is to our everlasting shame that we were unable to persuade the math department to give him tenure.&quot; Cook joined the faculty of the University of Toronto, Computer Science and Mathematics Departments in 1970 as an associate professor, where he was promoted to professor in 1975 and Distinguished Professor in 1985.

==Research==

During his PhD, Cook worked on complexity of functions, mainly on multiplication. In his seminal 1971 paper &quot;The Complexity of Theorem Proving Procedures&quot;, Cook formalized the notions of polynomial-time reduction (also known as Cook reduction) and NP-completeness, and proved the existence of an NP-complete problem by showing that the Boolean satisfiability problem (usually known as SAT) is NP-complete. This theorem was proven independently by Leonid Levin in the Soviet Union, and has thus been given the name the Cook–Levin theorem. The paper also formulated the most famous problem in computer science, the P vs. NP problem. Informally, the &quot;P vs. NP&quot; question asks whether every optimization problem whose answers can be efficiently verified for correctness/optimality can be solved optimally with an efficient algorithm. Given the abundance of such optimization problems in everyday life, a positive answer to the &quot;P vs. NP&quot; question would likely have profound practical and philosophical consequences.

Cook conjectures that there are optimization problems (with easily checkable solutions) that cannot be solved by efficient algorithms, i.e., P is not equal to NP. This conjecture has generated a great deal of research in computational complexity theory, which has considerably improved our understanding of the inherent difficulty of computational problems and what can be computed efficiently. Yet, the conjecture remains open and is among the seven famous Millennium Prize Problems.

In 1982, Cook received the Turing Award for his contributions to complexity theory. His citation reads:

For his advancement of our understanding of the complexity of computation in a significant and profound way. His seminal paper, &quot;The Complexity of Theorem Proving Procedures,&quot; presented at the 1971 ACM SIGACT Symposium on the Theory of Computing, laid the foundations for the theory of NP-Completeness. The ensuing exploration of the boundaries and nature of NP-complete class of problems has been one of the most active and important research activities in computer science for the last decade.

In his &quot;Feasibly Constructive Proofs and the Propositional Calculus&quot; paper published in 1975, he introduced the equational theory PV (standing for Polynomial-time Verifiable) to formalize the notion of proofs using only polynomial-time concepts. He made another major contribution to the field in his 1979 paper, joint with his student Robert A. Reckhow, &quot;The Relative Efficiency of Propositional Proof Systems&quot;, in which they formalized the notions of p-simulation and efficient propositional proof system, which started an area now called propositional proof complexity. They proved that the existence of a proof system in which every true formula has a short proof is equivalent to NP = coNP. Cook co-authored a book with his student Phuong The Nguyen in this area titled &quot;Logical Foundations of Proof Complexity&quot;.

His main research areas are complexity theory and proof complexity, with excursions into programming language semantics, parallel computation, and artificial intelligence. Other areas that he has contributed to include bounded arithmetic, bounded reverse mathematics, complexity of higher type functions, complexity of analysis, and lower bounds in propositional proof systems.

===Some other contributions===
He named the complexity class NC after Nick Pippenger. The complexity class SC is named after him. The definition of the complexity class AC0 and its hierarchy AC are also introduced by him.

According to Don Knuth the KMP algorithm was inspired by Cook&#x27;s automata for recognizing concatenated palindromes in linear time.

==Awards and honors==
Cook was awarded an NSERC E.W.R. Steacie Memorial Fellowship in 1977, a Killam Research Fellowship in 1982, and received the CRM-Fields-PIMS prize in 1999. He has won John L. Synge Award and Bernard Bolzano Medal of the Czech Academy of Sciences (2008), and is a fellow of the Royal Society of London and Royal Society of Canada. Cook was elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences (United States) and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is a corresponding member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities.

Cook won the ACM Turing Award in 1982. 
Association for Computing Machinery honored him as a Fellow of ACM in 2008 for his
&quot;fundamental contributions to the theory of computational complexity&quot;.
He was selected by the Association for Symbolic Logic to give the Gödel Lecture in 1999.

The Government of Ontario appointed him to the Order of Ontario in 2013, the highest honor in Ontario. He has won the 2012 Gerhard Herzberg Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering, the highest honor for scientists and engineers in Canada. The Herzberg Medal is awarded by NSERC for &quot;both the sustained excellence and overall influence of research work conducted in Canada in the natural sciences or engineering&quot;. He was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2015.

Cook was granted the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award 2015 in the Information and Communication Technologies category &quot;for his important role in identifying what computers can and cannot solve efficiently,&quot; in the words of the jury&#x27;s citation. His work, it continues, &quot;has had a dramatic impact in all fields where complex computations are crucial.&quot;

Cook has supervised numerous MSc students, and 36 PhD students have completed their degrees under his supervision.

==Personal life==
Cook lives with his wife in Toronto. They have two sons, one of whom is Olympic sailor Gordon Cook.

<doc id="39434" wikidata="Q92602" url="?curid=39434" title="Tony Hoare">
<text>Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare (; born 11 January 1934), also known as C. A. R. Hoare, is a British computer scientist who has made foundational contributions to programming languages, algorithms, operating systems, formal verification, and concurrent computing. His work earned him the Turing Award, usually regarded as the highest distinction in computer science, in 1980.

Hoare developed the sorting algorithm quicksort in 1959–1960. He developed Hoare logic, an axiomatic basis for verifying program correctness. In the semantics of concurrency, he introduced the formal language communicating sequential processes (CSP) to specify the interactions of concurrent processes, and along with Edsger Dijkstra, formulated the dining philosophers problem. Since 1977, he has held positions at the University of Oxford and Microsoft Research in Cambridge.

==Education and early life==
Tony Hoare was born in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to British parents; his father was a colonial civil servant and his mother was the daughter of a tea planter. Hoare was educated in England at the Dragon School in Oxford and the King&#x27;s School in Canterbury. He then studied Classics and Philosophy (&quot;Greats&quot;) at Merton College, Oxford. On graduating in 1956 he did 18 months National Service in the Royal Navy, where he learned Russian. He returned to the University of Oxford in 1958 to study for a postgraduate certificate in statistics, and it was here that he began computer programming, having been taught Autocode on the Ferranti Mercury by Leslie Fox. He then went to Moscow State University as a British Council exchange student, where he studied machine translation under Andrey Kolmogorov.

==Research and career==
In 1960, Hoare left the Soviet Union and began working at Elliott Brothers Ltd, a small computer manufacturing firm located in London. There, he implemented the language ALGOL 60 and began developing major algorithms.

He was involved with developing international standards in programming and informatics, as a member of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi, which specified, maintains, and supports the languages ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68.

He became the Professor of Computing Science at the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast in 1968, and in 1977 returned to Oxford as the Professor of Computing to lead the Programming Research Group in the Oxford University Computing Laboratory (now Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford), following the death of Christopher Strachey. He became the first Christopher Strachey Professor of Computing on its establishment in 1988 until his retirement at Oxford in 2000. He is now an Emeritus Professor there, and is also a principal researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England.

Hoare&#x27;s most significant work has been in the following areas: his sorting and selection algorithm (Quicksort and Quickselect), Hoare logic, the formal language communicating sequential processes (CSP) used to specify the interactions between concurrent processes (and implemented in various programming languages such as occam), structuring computer operating systems using the monitor concept, and the axiomatic specification of programming languages.

Speaking at a software conference in 2009, Tony Hoare hyperbolically apologized for inventing the null reference:
For many years under his leadership, Hoare&#x27;s Oxford department worked on formal specification languages such as CSP and Z. These did not achieve the expected take-up by industry, and in 1995 Hoare was led to reflect upon the original assumptions:

A commemorative article was written in tribute to Hoare for his 90th birthday.

<doc id="39442" wikidata="Q2652943" url="?curid=39442" title="Anahuac (Aztec)">
<text>Anahuac is the ancient core of Mexico. Anahuac is a Nahuatl name which means &quot;close to water.&quot; It can be broken down like this: &#x27; +&#x27;. &#x27; means &quot;water&quot; and&#x27;, which is a relational word that can be affixed to a noun, means &quot;close to.&quot; Anahuac is sometimes used interchangeably with &quot;Valley of Mexico&quot;, but Anahuac properly designates the south-central part of the valley, where well-developed pre-Hispanic culture traits had created distinctive landscapes now hidden by the urban sprawl of Mexico City. In the sense of modern geomorphological terminology, &quot;Valley of Mexico&quot; is misnamed.

==Boundaries==
According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, Anáhuac (&quot;sic&quot;) is &quot;limited by the traditional and vaguely defined boundaries of an ancient American empire or confederation of that name previous to the Spanish conquest.&quot;

One of the possible etymologies proposed for the name &quot;Nicaragua&quot; is that it is derived from any of the following Nahuatl words: &#x27;, which meant &quot;Anahuac reached this far&quot;, or &quot;the Nahuas came this far&quot;, or &quot;those who come from Anahuac came this far&quot;; &#x27;, which meant &quot;here are the Nahuas&quot;; or &quot;&quot;, which meant &quot;here by the water&quot; or &quot;surrounded by water&quot;. The first two explanations would have a bearing on the above issue of the borders.

<doc id="39443" wikidata="Q4040" url="?curid=39443" title="Aragon">
<text>Aragon ( , ; Spanish and ; ) is an autonomous community in Spain, coextensive with the medieval Kingdom of Aragon. In northeastern Spain, the Aragonese autonomous community comprises three provinces (from north to south): Huesca, Zaragoza, and Teruel. Its capital is Zaragoza. The current Statute of Autonomy declares Aragon a &quot;historic nationality&quot; of Spain.

Covering an area of , the region&#x27;s terrain ranges diversely from permanent glaciers to verdant valleys, rich pasture lands and orchards, through to the arid steppes of the central lowlands. Aragon is home to many rivers—most notably, the river Ebro, Spain&#x27;s largest river in volume, which runs west–east across the entire region through the province of Zaragoza. It is also home to the highest mountains of the Pyrenees.

, the population of Aragon was , with slightly over half living in the capital city, Zaragoza. In 2020, the economy of Aragon generated a GDP of million, which represents 3.1% of Spain&#x27;s national GDP, and is currently 6th in per capita production behind Madrid, Basque Country, Navarre, Catalonia and La Rioja.

In addition to its three provinces, Aragon is subdivided into 33 comarcas or counties. All comarcas of Aragon have a rich geopolitical and cultural history from its pre-Roman, Celtic and Roman days, four centuries of Islamic rule as Marca Superior of Al-Andalus or kingdom (or taifa) of Saraqusta, as lands that once belonged to the Frankish Marca Hispanica, counties that later formed the Kingdom of Aragon, and eventually the Crown of Aragon.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===

The area of Aragon is of which belong to the province of Huesca, to the province of Zaragoza and to the province of Teruel. The total represents a 9.43% of the surface of Spain, being thus the fourth autonomous community in size behind Castile and León, Andalusia, and Castile-La Mancha.

It is located in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula, at a latitude between 39º and 43º&#x27;N in the temperate zone. Its boundaries and borders are in the north with France (the regions of Nouvelle-Aquitaine and Occitanie), in the west with the autonomous communities of Castile-La Mancha (provinces of Guadalajara and Cuenca), Castile and León (province of Soria), La Rioja and Navarre, and in the east with the autonomous communities of Catalonia (provinces of Lérida and Tarragona) and the Valencian Community (provinces of Castellón and Valencia).

=== Relief ===
The orography of the community has as the central axis the Ebro valley (with heights between 150 and 300 meters approx.) which transits between two foothill areas, the Pyrenean and the Iberian, preambles of two mountain formations, the Pyrenees to the north and the Sistema Ibérico mountain range to the south; the Community has the highest peaks of both mountain ranges, the Aneto and the Moncayo respectively.

==== Pyrenees ====
The Aragonese Pyrenees are located in the north of the province of Huesca and are arranged longitudinally in three large units: High Pyrenees, Internal Depressions and Outer Ranges.

The Aragonese High Pyrenees contains the maximum heights of all the Pyrenees mountainous chain. The High Pyrenees is formed in turn by the axial Pyrenees and the Inland Ranges.

In the axial Pyrenees are the oldest materials: granites, quartzites, slates and limestones and the highest peaks like: the Aneto (), Maladeta () and the Perdiguero (). The inner Pre-Pyrenees, composed of more modern rocks (limestones) also has large mountains such as Monte Perdido (), Collarada () and Tendeñera ().


The main Pyrenean valleys are formed by the rivers that are born there, which are:

* Ansó Valley: Veral river
* Hecho Valley: Aragón Subordán river
* Canfranc Valley: Aragón river
* Tena Valley: Gállego river
* Broto Valley: Ara river
* Aínsa Valley: Cinca river
** Pineta Valley: Cinca river
** Gistau Valley: Cinqueta river
* Benasque Valley: Ésera river

The intrapirenaic depression is a broad perpendicular corridor. Its best represented section is the Canal de Berdún, which limits on the south with the reliefs of San Juan de la Peña () and Oroel Rock (), modeled on conglomerates of the Campodarbe Formation.

The pre-Pyrenean outer ranges are in the Huescan foothills and constitute the southernmost unit of the Pyrenees; formed by predominantly calcareous materials, reach heights between and meters. The Sierra de Guara, one of the most important mountain ranges of the Spanish Pre-Pyrenees, stands out; its summit, the Guara Peak, reaches metres. The Mallos de Riglos, near the town of Ayerbe, stand out for their beauty.

==== Depression of the Ebro ====
The Aragonese central depression includes a wide lowland area, which is also the central part of the Depression of the Ebro. North of the river there is the Sierra de Alcubierre ranges () one of the typical limestone plateaus of the valley.

The Ebro Valley is a tectonic pit filled with sedimentary materials, accumulated in the Tertiary age in horizontal series. In the center, fine materials such as clays, plasters and limestones were deposited. To the south of the Ebro there are the limestone plateaus of Borja and of Zaragoza.

==== Sistema Ibérico ====
The Aragonese section of the Sistema Ibérico straddles the provinces of Zaragoza and Teruel. It is a set of hills without a clear structural unit, which can be divided into two zones: Sistema Ibérico del Jalón and Sistema Ibérico turolense. In the first, the Moncayo stands out with , formed by Paleozoic quartzites and slates, partly covered by Mesozoic limestones. The second is formed by elevated terrain (from to in general), but flattened and massive. To the southwest of the depression the summits of the Sierra de Albarracín range are reached above , southeast the are reached in the Sierra de Javalambre range and finally the Sierra de Gúdar range () transitions to the Maestrazgo area in the Valencian Community.

=== Climate and vegetation ===

There are two main types of climate in Aragón, the Semi-arid climate and the Oceanic climate. Its irregular orography creates several microclimates throughout the entire community. From the High mountain Alpine climate of the central Pyrenees to the north, with perpetual ice (glaciers), to the Humid subtropical climate (which is very common in Huesca&#x27;s lower altitude areas) to the steppe or semi-desert zones, such as the Monegros Desert, passing through the intense continental climate of the Teruel-Daroca area and the Mediterranean climate in the southern areas bordering Castilla La Mancha and the Valencian Community.

The main characteristics of the Aragonese climate are:
* Rainfall is mostly low, with much of Aragon placed in a &quot;bowl&quot; of low ground between the Pyrenean mountain range to the north and the Sistema Ibérico mountain range to the south, cut off from maritime air masses. This situation means that the rain falls mainly in the higher areas, and that the temperature range features large contrasts, with cold winters and hot summers, as typical of continental climates.

* Rainfall is also irregular, as typical of Mediterranean climates, with randomly alternating dry and wet years.
* The air currents are often encased in the middle Ebro Valley from northwest to southeast, giving a characteristic wind, the &quot;cierzo&quot;, which stands out for its intensity and frequency.

Temperatures are very dependent on the altitude. In the Ebro Valley the winters are relatively moderate, although the frosts are very common and the thermal sensation can decrease a lot with the &quot;cierzo&quot;. Temperatures in summer can exceed 40 °C in the central areas. In mountain areas winters are long and rigorous, average temperatures can be up to 10 °C lower than in the valley.

The two most important winds of Aragon are the &quot;cierzo&quot; and the &quot;bochorno&quot; or levant. The first is a cold and dry wind that crosses the Ebro Valley from northwest to southeast and that can become quite strong. The second is a warm wind, more irregular and smooth, coming from the south-east.

The vegetation follows the oscillations of relief and climate. There is a great variety, both in natural vegetation and in crops. In the high areas there are forests (pines, firs, beech trees, oaks), bush and meadows, and in the central Ebro Valley, evergreen oak and juniper are the most common trees.

=== Hydrography ===
Most Aragonese rivers are tributaries of the Ebro River, which is the largest river in Spain and divides the community in two. Of the tributaries of the left bank of the river, the ones originating in the Pyrenees, the Aragón River stands out. Its headwaters are in Huesca, but it ends at the community of Navarre, the Gállego and the Cinca, which joins the Segre just before emptying into the Ebro at the height of Mequinenza. On the right bank, the Jalón, Huerva and Guadalope stand out.

In the stream bed of the Ebro river, near the border with Catalonia, the Mequinenza Reservoir, of and a length of about 110 km; it is popularly known as the &quot;Sea of Aragon&quot;.

The small Pyrenean mountain lakes called ibones merit special mention. These lakes are very scenic, originating during the last glaciation, and are usually found above .

The Autonomous Community lies within three hydrographic regions, the Ebro River, the Tagus River (which originates in the Sierra de Albarracín range), and the Júcar, which has as its main river in this community the Turia.

=== Protected spaces ===
In Aragon, protected natural spaces are managed through the Red Natural de Aragón, an entity created in 2004 to protect all elements with ecological, landscape and cultural value and at the same time coordinate and establish common standards that contribute to their conservation and sustainable use. In this entity are integrated national parks, natural parks, nature reserves, biosphere reserves and other protected natural areas that have been declared by the autonomous community, the Ramsar Convention or the Natura 2000.

Within the protected areas is the only national park of Aragon: the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park, the second national park created in Spain, in 1918, it is found in the Pyrenees in the comarca of Sobrarbe, occupies an area of , a part of the of the peripheral area of protection. It also enjoys other figures of protection like the Biosphere Reserve of Ordesa-Viñamala and is cataloged as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

In addition there are 4 other natural parks: the Moncayo Natural Park with an extension of , the Sierra y Cañones de Guara Natural Park with and of peripheral area of protection, the Posets-Maladeta Natural Park with and of peripheral area of protection, and the Valles Occidentales Natural Park with and of peripheral area of protection.

There are also three nature reserves, five natural monuments and three protected landscapes.

==== Aiguabarreig Segre-Cinca-Ebro ====

At the confluence of the Segre and Ebro rivers, the Aiguabarreig Ebro-Segre-Cinca is a space with great natural wealth and a great variety of ecosystems that range from Mediterranean steppes to impenetrable riverside forests, making this space a paradise for biodiversity. Territorially, the Aiguabarreig is at the center of the Middle Depression of the Ebro. It borders to the west with the Monegros, to the east with the Tossals de Montmeneu and Almatret and to the south with the tail of the Ribarroja reservoir. This space is named with Catalan word of origin that designates the place where two or more water streams meet and form one. The Segre and Cinca form a first Aiguabarreig between the towns of La Granja d&#x27;Escarp, Massalcoreig and Torrente de Cinca, a few kilometers downstream they converge with the waters of the Ebro, already in the municipality of Mequinenza, forming one of the largest river confluences of the entire Iberian Peninsula.

== History ==
Aragon, occupying the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula has served as a bridge between the Mediterranean Sea, the peninsular center and the coasts of the Cantabrian Sea. The human presence in the lands that today form the autonomous community date back several millennia, but present-day Aragon, like many of the current historical nationalities, was formed during the Middle Ages.

=== Prehistory ===
The oldest testimonies of human life in the lands that today make up Aragon go back to the time of the glaciations, in the Pleistocene, some years ago. This population left the Acheulean industry that found its best weapons in the hand axes of flint or the cleavers of quartzite.

In the Upper Palaeolithic appeared two new cultures: Solutrean and Magdalenian.

The Epipaleolithic was centered in Lower Aragon, occupying the epoch between the 7th and the 5th millennium.

In the first half of the 5th millennium BCE, Neolithic remains are found in the Huescan Outer Ranges and in Lower Aragon.

The Eneolithic was characterized in the province of Huesca presenting two important megalithic nuclei: the Pre-Pyrenees of the Outer Ranges and the High Pyrenean valleys.

The Late Bronze Age begins in Aragon around 1100 BCE with the arrival of the Urnfield culture. They are Indo-European people, with an alleged origin in Central Europe, who incinerate their dead by placing the ashes in a funeral urn. There are examples in the Cave del Moro of Olvena, the Masada del Ratón in Fraga, Palermo and the Cabezo de Monleón in Caspe.

From the metallurgical point of view there seems to be a boom given the increase in foundry molds that are located in the populations.

The Iron Age is the most important, since throughout the centuries it is the true substratum of the Aragonese historical population.

The arrival of Central Europeans during the Bronze Age by Pyrenees until reaching the Lower Aragon area, supposed an important ethnic contribution that prepared the way to the invasions of Iron Age.

=== Ancient history ===


The Mediterranean contributions represented a commercial activity that will constitute a powerful stimulus for the iron metallurgy, promoting the modernization of the tools and the indigenous armament, replacing the old bronze with the iron. There is presence of Phoenician, Greek and Etruscan products.

In the 6th century BCE there are six groups with different social organization: Vascones, Suessetani, Sedetani, Iacetani, Ilergetes and Citerior Celtiberians.

They are Iberized groups with a tendency towards stability, fixing their habitat in durable populations, with dwellings that evolve towards more enduring and stable models. There are many examples in Aragon, among them Cabezo de Monleón in Caspe, Puntal of Fraga, Roquizal del Rullo or Loma de los Brunos.

The type of social organization was based on the family group, consisting of four generations. Self-sufficient societies in which the greater part of the population was dedicated to agricultural and livestock activities. In the Iberian scope the power was monarchical, exercised by a king; there was a democratic assembly with participation of the male population.

There were visible social differentiations and established legal-political statutes.

The Romans arrived and progressed easily into the interior.

In the territorial distribution that Rome made of Hispania, the current Aragon was included in the Hispania Citerior. In the year 197 BCE, Sempronius Tuditanus is the praetor of the Citerior and had to face a general uprising in their territories that ended with the Roman defeat and the own death of Tuditanus. In view of these facts the Senate sent the consul Marcus Porcius Cato with an army of men. The indigenous peoples of the area were rebelling, except for the Ilergetes who negotiated peace with Cato.

There were different uprisings of the Iberian peoples against the Romans, in 194 BCE sees a general uprising with elimination of half of the Roman army, in 188 BCE Manlius Acidinus Fulvianus, praetor of the Citerior, must confront in Calagurris (Calahorra) with the Celtiberians, in the 184 BCE Terentius Varro did it with the Suessetani, to those who took the capital, Corbio.

In the 1st century BCE Aragon was the scene of the civil war to seize the power of Rome where the governor Quintus Sertorius made Osca (Huesca) the capital of all the territories controlled by them.

Already in the 1st century BCE, the today Aragonese territory became part of the province Tarraconensis and there was the definitive romanization of it creating roads and consolidating ancient Celtiberian and Iberian cities such as Caesaraugusta (Zaragoza), Turiaso (Tarazona), Osca (Huesca) or Bilbilis (Calatayud).

In the middle of the 3rd century the decay of the Roman Empire began. Between the years 264 and 266 the Franks and the Alemanni, two Germanic peoples who passed through the Pyrenees and came to Tarazona, which they sacked. In the agony of the Empire groups of bandits emerged who were dedicated to pillage. The Ebro Valley was ravaged in the 5th century by several gangs of evildoers called Bagaudae.

=== Middle Ages ===


After the disintegration of the Western Roman Empire, the current area of Aragon was occupied by the Visigoths, forming the Visigothic Kingdom.

In the year 714 muslims from North Africa conquered the central area of Aragon, converting to Islam the ancient Roman cities such as Saraqusta (Zaragoza) or Wasqa (Huesca). It was at this time that an important Muwallad family arose, the Banu Qasi (بنو قاسي), their domains were located in the Ebro Valley between the 8th and 10th centuries.
After the disappearance of the Caliphate of Córdoba at the beginning of the 11th century, the Taifa of Zaragoza arose, one of the most important Taifas of Al-Andalus, leaving a great artistic, cultural and philosophical legacy.

The name of Aragon is documented for the first time during the Early Middle Ages in the year 828, when the small County of Aragon of Frankish origin, would emerge between the rivers that bear its name, the Aragón river, and its brother the Aragón Subordán river.


That County of Aragon would be linked to the Kingdom of Pamplona until 1035, and under its wing it would grow to form a dowry of García Sánchez III of Pamplona until the death of the king Sancho &quot;the Great&quot;, in a period characterized by Muslim hegemony over almost the entire Iberian Peninsula. During the reign of Ramiro I of Aragon the borders would be extended following the annexation of the counties of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza (year 1044), after having incorporated the populations of the historical comarca of Cinco Villas.

In 1076, on the death of Sancho IV of Pamplona, Aragon incorporated part of the Navarrese kingdom into its territories while Castile did the same with the western area of the former domains of Sancho &quot;the Great&quot;. During the reigns of Sancho Ramírez and Peter I of Aragon and Pamplona, the kingdom extended its borders to the south, established threatening fortresses in the capital of Zaragoza in El Castellar and Juslibol and took Huesca, which became the new capital.

The reign of Alfonso I of Aragon saw the conquering of the lowlands of the middle Ebro Valley for Aragon: Ejea de los Caballeros, Valtierra, Calatayud, Tudela and Zaragoza, the capital of the Taifa of Saraqusta. Upon his death the nobles would choose his brother Ramiro II of Aragon, who left his religious life to assume the royal scepter and perpetuate the dynasty, which he achieved with the dynastic union of the House of Aragon with the owner of the County of Barcelona in 1137, year in which the union of both patrimonies would give rise to the Crown of Aragon and would add the forces that would make the conquests of the Kingdom of Majorca and the Kingdom of Valencia possible. The Crown of Aragon would become the hegemonic power of the Mediterranean, controlling territories as important as Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia or Naples.

The monarch was known as King of Aragon and also held the titles of King of Valencia, King of Majorca (for a time), Count of Barcelona, Lord of Montpellier, and (temporarily) Duke of Athens and Neopatria. Each of these titles gave him sovereignty over the specific region, and the titles changed as territories were lost and won.

According to Aragonese law, the monarch had to swear allegiance to the kingdom&#x27;s laws before being accepted as king. Like other Pyrenean and Basque realms, the Aragonese justice and decision-making system was based on Pyrenean consuetudinary law, the King was considered &quot;primus inter pares&quot; (&#x27;first among equals&#x27;) within the nobility. A nobleman with the title &quot;Chustizia d&#x27;Aragón&quot; acted as ombudsman and was responsible for ensuring that the King obeyed the Aragonese laws. An old saying goes, &quot;en Aragón antes de Rey hubo Ley&quot; (&quot;in Aragon Law came before King&quot;), similar to the saying in Navarre, &quot;antes fueron Leyes que Reyes&quot;, with much the same meaning.

The subsequent legend made the Aragonese monarchy eligible and created a phrase for the coronation of the king that would be perpetuated for centuries:

This situation would be repeated in the Commitment of Caspe (1412), which avoids a war that had dismembered the Crown of Aragon when a good handful of aspirants to the throne emerged after the death of Martin of Aragon a year after the death of his first-born, Martin I of Sicily. Ferdinand I of Aragon is the chosen one, of the Castilian House of Trastámara, but also directly connected with the Aragonese king Peter IV of Aragon, through his mother Eleanor of Aragon.

Aragon was already a large-scale political entity: the Crown, the Cortes, the Deputation of the Kingdom and the Foral Law constituted its nature and its character. The marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon with Isabella I of Castile, celebrated in 1469 in Valladolid, derived later in the union of the crowns of Aragon and Castile, creating the basis of the Modern State.

=== Early Modern Age c. 1500–1789 ===
The Early Modern Age was marked by increasing tension between the power of the Spanish Monarchy and those of the regions. The appointment of a Castilian as Viceroy in 1590, contrary to the agreement all Royal officials be Aragonese caused widespread unrest; when the Madrid authorities attempted to arrest the Aragonese writer and politician Antonio Perez in May 1591, it caused street violence in Zaragossa and a revolt known as the Alterations of Aragon. The unrest was largely confined to Zaragossa and quickly suppressed, with Perez going into exile. Philip then ordered a reduction in the proportion of taxes retained by the Generality of Aragon to lessen their capacity to raise an army against him.

The decay of independent institutions meant political activity focused instead on the preservation of Aragonese history, culture and art. The Archive of the Kingdom of Aragon preserved legal documents and records from the Justiciar and the Palace of Deputation or Parliament, largely destroyed by the French in the battles of 1809. Debates on the causes of the 1590/91 revolt became a contest between opposing views of history that arguably persist in modern Spain.

The new emphasis on Aragonese history led to the creation of the position of Chronicler or Historian of Aragon; its holders included Jerónimo Zurita y Castro, the De Argensola brothers, Bartolomé and Lupercio, Juan Costa and Jerónimo Martel. Much of the work produced by Aragonese writers challenged Philip II&#x27;s version of events and were censored by the central government. In retaliation, the Generality of Aragon ordered the work of Castilian historian Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas to be burned and commissioned Vicencio Blasco de Lanuza to write an alternative. His &#x27;History of Aragon&#x27; was published in two volumes, 1616 and 1619 respectively; the urgency shows the importance placed on responding to Herrera. Other works commissioned at this time for the same purpose include a &quot;History of the Aragonese Deputation&quot; by Lorenzo Ibáñez de Aoiz and a detailed cartography of the Kingdom of Aragon by João Baptista Lavanha.

In 1590/91, the Spanish monarchy was at the height of its strength but during the 17th century Spanish power declined for a number of reasons. Famine, disease and almost continuous warfare, largely in the Spanish Netherlands drained money, energy and men and weakened the economy; it is estimated the population of Spain fell nearly 25% between 1600 and 1700.

War and economic decline inevitably led to increases in taxes, with predictable results; the refusal of the Catalan Cortes to contribute their share of the 1626 Union of Arms eventually led to a full-scale revolt in 1640. While Aragon itself remained relatively peaceful, it had to be treated with care by the Madrid government; during the reign of Charles II from 1665 to 1700, it provided his half-brother John of Austria with a power base in his battle for control of government with the Queen Regent Mariana of Austria.

During the 1701–1714 War of the Spanish Succession, Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia and Majorca supported the Austrian claimant Charles. The victory of Philip V accelerated the trend towards greater centralisation; the &quot;Nueva Planta&quot; decrees of 1707 abolished the &quot;fueros&quot; and Aragonese political structures with their powers transferred to the Deputation of the Kingdom in Madrid; Aragon and Valencia were brought into the system in 1712, Catalonia and Majorca following in 1767.

=== 1790–1936 ===
The French invasion of 1808 that made Joseph Bonaparte King led to the outbreak of the &quot;Guerra de la Independencia Española&quot; or War of Independence in May. Zaragoza was largely destroyed in February 1809 during the Second Siege of Zaragoza, bringing a halt to its economic development. The 1812 Constitution proposed a number of reforms, including the creation of provincial territories and dividing Aragon into the four provinces of Calatayud, Teruel, Soria and Guadalajara. However, these reforms were delayed by Ferdinand VII&#x27;s refusal to accept the constitution and finally implemented in 1822 during the 1820–23 Trienio Liberal. When Ferdinand was restored by French Bourbon forces in 1823, he abolished the Constitution along with the provincial reforms. When he died in 1833, the provincial division of 1833 divided Aragon into its current three provinces.

Throughout the 19th century, Aragon was a stronghold of the Carlists, who offered to restore the &quot;fueros&quot; and other rights associated with the former Kingdom of Aragon. This period saw a massive exodus from the countryside into the larger cities of Aragon such as Huesca, Zaragoza, Teruel or Calatayud and other nearby regions, such as Catalonia or Madrid.

The history of Aragon in the first half of the 20th century was similar to that of the rest of Spain; the building of infrastructure and reforms made by Miguel Primo de Rivera led to a brief economic boom, with new civil and individual liberties during the Second Spanish Republic. In June 1936, a draft Statute of Autonomy of Aragon was presented to the Cortes Generales but the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War prevented the development of this autonomist project.

=== Spanish Civil War 1936–1939 ===
During the 1936–1939 Civil War, Aragon was divided between both sides. The eastern area closer to Catalonia was run by the Republican Regional Defence Council of Aragon, while the larger western area was controlled by the Nationalists. Some of the most important battles of the war were fought in or near Aragon, including Belchite, Teruel and Ebro. After the defeat of the Republic in April 1939, Aragon and the rest of Spain was governed by the Francoist dictatorship.

Aragon was a stronghold for the Spanish Revolution, which was a workers&#x27; social revolution that began at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and for two to three years resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and, more broadly, libertarian socialist organizational principles throughout various portions of the country.

In Aragon, agrarian collectives were formed that were structured by work groups of between five and ten members. To each work group, the community assigned a piece of land for which it was responsible. Each group elected a delegate who represented their views at community meetings. A management committee was responsible for the day-to-day running of the community. This committee was in charge of obtaining materials, carrying out exchanges with other areas, organizing the distribution of production, and the public works that were necessary. Its members were elected in general assemblies in which all the people who made up the community participated.

Even during the second phase of the revolution when some revolutionary structures were subordinated to the government, giving rise to the dissolution or beginning of absorption, appropriation, and intervention of the revolutionary structures by the republican state government, Aragon remained a stronghold of anarcho-syndicalist labor.

=== 1939 - Present ===
Especially during the 1960s, there were large migrations, with a depopulation of the rural areas, towards the industrial areas like the provincial capitals, other areas of Spain, and other European countries. In 1964, one of the so-called Development Poles was created in Zaragoza.

In the 1970s, the old town of Mequinenza was demolished almost completely due to the construction of the Ribarroja reservoir. The inhabitants of Mequinenza had to leave their homes to move to the new town on the banks of the River Segre. Some left for more industrial areas such as Barcelona or Zaragoza or even abroad to continue working in mining industries. By the end of 1974 all of the population had already abandoned the Old Town of Mequinenza and was living in the new town.

In the 1970s a period of transition as in the rest of the country was experienced, after the extinction of the previous regime, with the recovery of democratic normality and the creation of a new constitutional framework.

It began to demand an own political autonomy, for the Aragonese historical territory; sentiment that was reflected in the historic manifestation of April 23, 1978 that brought together more than aragoneses through the streets of Zaragoza.

Not having plebiscited, in the past, affirmatively a draft Statute of autonomy (second transitory provision of the constitution) and not making use of the difficult access to autonomy by Article 151 whose aggravated procedure required, apart from the initiative of the process autonomic follow the steps of article 143, which was ratified by three quarters of the municipalities of each of the affected provinces that represent at least the majority of the electoral census, and that this initiative was approved by referendum by the affirmative vote of the majority absolute of the electors of each province, Aragon acceded to the self-government by the slow way of article 143 obtaining lower competence top, and less self-management of resources, during more than 20 years.

On August 10, 1982, Aragon&#x27;s autonomy statute was approved by the Cortes Generales, signed by the then president of the Government, Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, and sanctioned by His Majesty Juan Carlos I of Spain.

On May 7, 1992, a Special Commission of the Aragonese Corts, elaborated a reformed text that was approved by the Aragonese Corts and by the Spanish Cortes. Again, a small statutory reform in the year 1996 extended the competence framework, forcing a definitive comprehensive review for several years, a new statutory text was approved in 2007, by majority but without reaching total unanimity.

In the 1990s the Aragonese society increases a significant qualitative step in the quality of life due to the economic progress of the State at all levels.

At the beginning of the 21st century, a significant increase in infrastructures was established, such as the arrival of the High Speed Train (AVE), the construction of the new dual carriageway Somport-Sagunto and the promotion of the two airports in the Autonomous Community, Zaragoza and Huesca-Pirineos. At the same time, large technological projects are being undertaken, such as the Walqa Technology Park and the implementation of a telematic network throughout the community.

In 2007 the Statute of Autonomy of Aragon was reformed again -which was approved by a broad consensus in the Aragonese Corts, having the support of the PSOE, the PP, the PAR and the IU, whereas CHA abstained- granting the Autonomous Community the recognition of historical nationality (since the Organic Law of 1996 reform of the statute, it had the condition of nationality), includes a new title on the Administration of Chustizia and another on the rights and duties of the Aragoneses and guiding principles of public policies, the possibility of creating an own tax agency in collaboration with that of the State, and also the obligation to public authorities to ensure to avoid transfers from watersheds such as transfer of the Ebro, among many other modifications of the Statute of Autonomy.

The designation of Zaragoza as the venue for the 2008 International Exhibition, whose thematic axis was Water and Sustainable development, represented a series of changes and accelerated growth for the autonomous community. In addition, two anniversaries were celebrated that same year, the bicentennial of Sieges of Zaragoza of the War of Independence against the Napoleonic invasion, occurred in 1808 and the centenary of the Hispano-French Exposition of 1908 that it supposed as a modern event, to demonstrate the cultural and economic thrust of Aragon and at the same time serve to strengthen ties and staunch wounds with the French neighbors after the events of the Napoleonic Wars of the previous century.

==Demographics==

===Population===
, half of Aragon&#x27;s population, 50.45%, live in the capital city of Zaragoza. Huesca is the only other city in the region with a population greater than .

The majority of Aragonese citizens, 71.8%, live in the province of Zaragoza. 17.1% live in the province of Huesca, and 11.1% in the province of Teruel. The population density of the region is the second lowest in Spain after Castilla-La Mancha: only 26.8/km2. The most densely populated areas are around the valley of the river Ebro, particularly around Zaragoza, and in the Pyrenean foothills, while the areas with the fewest inhabitants tend to be those that are higher up in the Pyrenean mountains, and in most of the southern province of Teruel.

Only four cities have a population of more than : Zaragoza , Huesca , Teruel , and Calatayud .

=== Languages ===
Spanish is the native language in most of Aragon, and it is the only official language, understood and spoken by virtually everyone in the region. In addition to it, the Aragonese language continues to be spoken in several local varieties in the mountainous northern counties of the Pyrenees, particularly in western Ribagorza, Sobrarbe, Jacetania and Somontano; it is enjoying a resurgence of popularity as a tool for regional identity. In the easternmost areas of Aragon, along the border with Catalonia, varieties of the Catalan language are spoken, including the comarcas of eastern Ribagorza, La Litera, Bajo Cinca, Bajo Aragón-Caspe, Bajo Aragón and Matarraña. The strip-shaped Catalan-speaking area in Aragon is often called &quot;La Franja&quot;.

The Declaration of Mequinenza (Declaració de Mequinensa in Catalan) was a document signed on February 1, 1984, in Mequinenza by the mayors of 17 municipalities of the Aragonese Catalan-speaking area together with José Bada Paniello (Minister of Culture of Government of Aragon at the time). Following the declaration, and complying with one of the proposals contained therein, on October 1, 1985, an agreement between the Government of Aragon and the Ministry of Education and Science was implemented for the teaching of the Catalan language as a voluntary and assessable subject in schools in the area.

The Languages Acts of Aragon of 2009 and 2013 have been passed to try to regulate the languages in this autonomous community. An update of these laws was announced but as of 2019 it has not been carried out.

===Territorial division===
Aragon is divided into three provinces from north to south, named after their capitals: Huesca, Zaragoza and Teruel. The provinces are further divided into 33 comarcas, three of which are in more than one province. There are a total of 732 municipalities in the region.

==Culture==

Some medieval monuments of Teruel and Zaragoza are protected by UNESCO as part of the World Heritage Sites &quot;Mudéjar Architecture of Aragon&quot;.

The traditional dance of Aragon is known as jota and is one of the faster Spanish dances. It is also the most widespread in Aragon and the exact style and music depend on the area.

There are other less popular dances named &quot;paloteaos&quot; similar to the sword/stick dances of other regions.

The music to one local dance, &quot;The Dance of Majordomos&quot; of Benasque, was so enjoyed by Rafael del Riego on a visit to the town that he ordered it to be copied resulting in the &quot;Hymn of Riego&quot;.

Typical Aragonese instruments include the stringed drum or &quot;Chicotén&quot;, bagpipes such as the &quot;gaita de boto&quot;, oboes such as the &quot;Dulzaina&quot;, and small flutes like the &quot;Chiflo&quot;. Some instruments have been lost, such as the &quot;trompa de Ribagorza&quot;, although there have been efforts to reconstruct them. In contrast to other Pyrenean regions, the &quot;Chicotén&quot; and &quot;Chiflo&quot; never have stopped being played.

The Carnival of Bielsa (Huesca) has ancient origins and includes a group of men carrying long sticks, wearing skirts, cowbells and boucard/goat-like horns and skins with black-painted faces called &quot;Trangas&quot; symbolising &quot;virility&quot; who surround another man wearing skins playing the part of a bear called &quot;l&#x27;onso&quot;. In Aragonese mythology the bear carried souls between the world of the living and the world of the dead. Trangas dance with young females named &quot;madamas&quot; symbolising &quot;purity&quot; and wearing colourful dresses. Other traditional figures include a horse rider named &quot;Caballé&quot;.

=== Cuisine ===

With its lush Pyrenean pastures, lamb, beef, and dairy products are, not surprisingly, predominant in Aragonese cuisine. Also of note is its ham from Teruel; olive oil from Empeltre and Arbequina; longaniza from Graus; rainbow trout and salmon, boar, truffles and wild mushrooms from the upper river valleys of the Jacetania, Gallego, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza regions; and wines from Cariñena, Somontano, Calatayud, and Campo de Borja; and fruit, especially peaches, from its fertile lower valleys. The region also features a unique local haggis, known as chireta, several interesting seafood dishes, including various crab pastes, which developed from an old superstition that crabs help prevent illness, and sweets such as &quot;Adoquines del Pilar&quot; and &quot;Frutas de Aragón&quot;. There are also other sweets like &quot;Tortas de alma&quot; from Teruel and &quot;Trenza de Almudevar&quot; or &quot;Castañas de Huesca&quot; from Huesca.

=== Research ===
The University of Zaragoza is the largest university in Aragon, which conduct research in various disciplines. Of the Nationally recognized research institutes, Aragon hosts the following:
* Astrophysical Observatory of Javalambre (OAJ), which is located in the Javalambre mountain range, south of the Teruel province. OAJ is managed by the Center for Physics Studies of the Cosmos of Aragon (CEFCA), which is located in the Teruel city.
* Canfranc Underground Laboratory, located in the north of the Huesca province and is managed by a consortium of the Aragon and national governments and the University of Zaragoza.

==Economy==
Aragon is among the richest autonomous regions in Spain, with GDP per capita above the nation&#x27;s average. The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the autonomous community was 37.0 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 3.1% of Spanish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 30,200 euros or 100% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 101% of the EU average.

The traditional agriculture-based economy from the mid-20th century has been greatly transformed in the past several decades and now service and industrial sectors are the backbone of the economy in the region.

The well-developed irrigation system around the Ebro has greatly supported the productive agriculture. The most important crops include wheat, barley, rye, fruit and grapes. Livestock-breeding is essential especially in the northern areas, where the lush meadows provide excellent conditions for sheep and cattle. As of November 2020 the regional livestock includes 8.8 million pigs (around six pigs per person), and, as of January 2021, 73.1 million gallifowls. Also as of November 2020, there were more than 1.6 million sheep and about 50,000 goats, as well as about 400,000 head of cattle, most of them in Huesca province. According to Greenpeace, 30% of the Aragonese territory is endangered by liquid manure from intensive farming, putting aquifers and other water reserves at risk.

The chief industrial centre is the capital Zaragoza, where the largest factories are located. The largest plant is the Opel automotive plant with employees and production of per year. It supports many related industries in the area. Other large plants in the city include factories for trains and household appliances. Mining of iron ore and coal is developed to the south, near Ojos Negros. Electricity production is concentrated to the north where numerous hydro power plants are located along the Pyrenean rivers and in the Teruel Power Plant. There is an aluminium refinery in the town of Sabiñánigo. The main centres of electronics industry are Zaragoza, Huesca and Benabarre. Chemical industry is developed in Zaragoza, Sabiñánigo, Monzón, Teruel, Ojos Negros, Fraga, Benabarre and others.

The transport infrastructure has been greatly improved. There are more than[data missing] of motorways which run from Zaragoza to Madrid, Teruel, Basque country, Huesca and Barcelona. The condition of the other roads is also good. there are cars in Aragon. Through the territory of the province runs the new high-speed railway between Madrid and Barcelona with siding from Zaragoza to Huesca, which is going to be continued to the French border. There is an International Airport at Zaragoza, as well as several smaller airports at Huesca, Caudé, Santa Cilia de Jaca and Villanueva de Gállego.

The unemployment rate stood at 11.6% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.
==Government and politics==

=== Current political organization ===
As an autonomous community of Spain, Aragon has an elected regional parliament (, , ) with 67 seats. It meets in the Aljafería, a Moorish palace in the capital city, Zaragoza. The Parliament chooses a President for the &quot;Diputación General de Aragón&quot; or Aragon Government, for a four-year term. The current president (since July 2015) is Javier Lambán of the PSOE. Nationally, Aragon elects 13 Deputies and 14 Senators to the Cortes Generales.

In addition to the Spanish political parties, there are a number of Aragonese parties, such as the Chunta Aragonesista, a left-wing Aragonese nationalist party, and the Aragonese Party, more conservative. Chunta Aragonesista had a seat in Spain&#x27;s national Congress of Deputies from 2000 to 2008, while the centrist Aragonese Party has three national senators, who are in coalition with the ruling People&#x27;s Party.

In a 2011 regional government survey, 47.6% of the population wanted greater autonomy for Aragon, while 35.2% were satisfied with its current level of autonomy. A total of 6% wanted an end to autonomy and 3.2% wanted full independence.

===Historic===
Aragon in the Middle Ages was the hub of the wider Crown of Aragon. The Crown was represented in the region from 1517 by a viceroy.

In 1479, King Ferdinand II of Aragon married Isabella I of Castile, a kingdom covering much of the rest of modern Spain. However, until the Nueva Planta decrees of 1707, Aragon maintained its own separate laws and institutions.

==Media==
Aragon has media set-ups in television, radio and numerous newspapers.

===Television===
On 21 April 2006, regional television broadcasts in Aragon officially began with the launch of Aragón TV. The law which established the CARTV (Aragon Corporation Radio and Television) dated from 1987, but various political disputes delayed the project for several legislatures.

During the years that Aragon had no public television, several media groups sought to supplement their absence.

== Symbols ==

The current coat of arms of Aragon is composed of the four barracks and is attested for the first time in 1499, consolidating since the Early Modern Ages to take root decisively in the 19th century and be approved, according to precept, by the Real Academia de la Historia in 1921.

The first quartering appears at the end of the 15th century and commemorates, according to traditional interpretation, the legendary kingdom of Sobrarbe; in the second quarter there is the so-called &quot;Cross of Íñigo Arista&quot;, innovation of Peter IV of Aragon (from an anachronistic interpretation of the cross that symbolized the religion of the Asturian, Navarrese and Aragonese Christian kings), who took it as shields of the ancient kings of Aragon, although historically there were no heraldic emblems in the peninsula (or &quot;signal shields&quot;, as it was said in the Middle Ages) before the union dynastic of 1137 of the House of Aragon with the House of Barcelona; in the third quartering appears the Saint George&#x27;s Cross escutcheoned of four heads of Moors (the call &quot;Cross of Alcoraz&quot;), that is witnessed for the first time in a seal of 1281 of Peter III of Aragon and would remember, according to tradition arising from the 14th century, the battle in which Peter I of Aragon and Pamplona and the future Alfonso I of Aragon took Huesca and was considered in the Early modern Ages one of the proprietary emblems of the kingdom of Aragon; and in the fourth is the emblem of the so-called &quot;bars of Aragon&quot; or Royal Sign of Aragon, the oldest of the heraldic emblems that are part of the current coat of arms, dated in the second half of the 12th century.

This emblem of gules and gold was used in seals, banners, shields and standards indistinctly, not being but a familiar emblem that later denoted the authority as King of Aragon until, with the birth of Modern State, began to be a territorial symbol.

The current flag was approved in 1984, with the provisions of Article 3 of the Statute of Autonomy of Aragon, the flag is the traditional of the four horizontal red bars on a yellow background with the coat of arms of Aragon shifted towards the flagpole.

The bars of Aragon, common historic element of the current four autonomous communities that once were integrated into the Crown of Aragon, present in the third quartering of the coat of arms of Spain.

The anthem of Aragon (himno de Aragón) was regulated in 1989 with music by the Aragonese composer Antón García Abril that combines the old Aragonese musical tradition with popular musical elements within a modern conception. The lyrics were elaborated by the Aragonese poets Ildefonso Manuel Gil, Ángel Guinda, Rosendo Tello and Manuel Vilas and highlights within its poetic framework, values such as freedom, justice, reason, truth, open land ... that historically represent the expression of Aragon as a people. Another song, &quot;Canto a la libertad&quot;, is often regarded as the de facto unofficial anthem of Aragon.

The Day of Aragon is celebrated on April 23 and commemorates Saint George, patron of the Kingdom of Aragon since the 15th century. It appears in Article 3 of the Statute of Autonomy of Aragon since 1984. Institutional acts such as the delivery of the Aragon Awards by the Government of Aragon or the composition of a flag of Aragon of flowers, with the collaboration of citizens, in the Plaza de Aragón square of Zaragoza.

<doc id="39445" wikidata="Q582667" url="?curid=39445" title="Anti-psychiatry">
<text>Anti-psychiatry, sometimes spelled antipsychiatry, is a movement based on the view that psychiatric treatment can be often more damaging than helpful to patients. The term anti-psychiatry was coined in 1912, and the movement emerged in the 1960s, highlighting controversies about psychiatry. Objections include the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis, the questionable effectiveness and harm associated with psychiatric medications, the failure of psychiatry to demonstrate any disease treatment mechanism for psychiatric medication effects, and legal concerns about equal human rights and civil freedom being nullified by the presence of diagnosis. Historical critiques of psychiatry came to light after focus on the extreme harms associated with electroconvulsive therapy and insulin shock therapy. The term &quot;anti-psychiatry&quot; is in dispute and often used to dismiss all critics of psychiatry, many of whom agree that a specialized role of helper for people in emotional distress may at times be appropriate, and allow for individual choice around treatment decisions.

Beyond concerns about effectiveness, anti-psychiatry might question the philosophical and ethical underpinnings of psychotherapy and psychoactive medication, seeing them as shaped by social and political concerns rather than the autonomy and integrity of the individual mind. They may believe that &quot;judgements on matters of sanity should be the prerogative of the philosophical mind&quot;, and that the mind should not be a medical concern. Some activists reject the psychiatric notion of mental illness. Anti-psychiatry considers psychiatry a coercive instrument of oppression due to an unequal power relationship between doctor, therapist, and patient or client, and a highly subjective diagnostic process. Involuntary commitment, which can be enforced legally through sectioning, is an important issue in the movement. When sectioned, involuntary treatment may also be legally enforced by the medical profession against the patient&#x27;s will. 

The decentralized movement has been active in various forms for two centuries. In the 1960s, there were many challenges to psychoanalysis and mainstream psychiatry, in which the very basis of psychiatric practice was characterized as repressive and controlling. Psychiatrists identified with the anti-psychiatry movement included Timothy Leary, R. D. Laing, Franco Basaglia, Theodore Lidz, Silvano Arieti, and David Cooper. Others involved were Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari, and Erving Goffman. Cooper used the term &quot;anti-psychiatry&quot; in 1967, and wrote the book &quot;Psychiatry and Anti-psychiatry&quot; in 1971. The word &quot;Antipsychiatrie&quot; was already used in Germany in 1904. Thomas Szasz introduced the definition of mental illness as a &quot;myth&quot; in the book &quot;The Myth of Mental Illness&quot; (1961). However his literature actually very clearly states that he was directly undermined by the movement led by David Cooper (1931–1986) and that Cooper sought to replace psychiatry with his own brand of it. Giorgio Antonucci, who advocated a non-psychiatric approach to psychological suffering, did not consider himself to be part of the antipsychiatric movement. His position is represented by &quot;the non-psychiatric thinking, which considers psychiatry an ideology devoid of scientific content, a non-knowledge, whose aim is to annihilate people instead of trying to understand the difficulties of life, both individual and social, and then to defend people, change society, and create a truly new culture&quot;. Antonucci introduced the definition of psychiatry as a prejudice in the book &quot;I pregiudizi e la conoscenza critica alla psichiatria&quot; (1986).

The movement continues to influence thinking about psychiatry and psychology, both within and outside of those fields, particularly in terms of the relationship between providers of treatment and those receiving it. Contemporary issues include freedom versus coercion, nature versus nurture, and the right to be different.

Critics of antipsychiatry from within psychiatry itself object to the underlying principle that psychiatry is harmful, although they usually accept that there are issues that need addressing. Medical professionals often consider anti-psychiatry movements to be promoting mental illness denial, and some consider their claims to be comparable to conspiracy theories.

== History ==

=== Precursors ===

The first widespread challenge to the prevailing medical approach in Western countries occurred in the late 18th century. Part of the progressive Age of Enlightenment, a &quot;moral treatment&quot; movement challenged the harsh, pessimistic, somatic (body-based) and restraint-based approaches that prevailed in the system of hospitals and &quot;madhouses&quot; for people considered mentally disturbed, who were generally seen as wild animals without reason. Alternatives were developed, led in different regions by ex-patient staff, physicians themselves in some cases, and religious and lay philanthropists. This &quot;moral treatment&quot; was seen as pioneering more humane psychological and social approaches, whether or not in medical settings; however, it also involved some use of physical restraints, threats of punishment, and personal and social methods of control. As it became the establishment approach in the 19th century, opposition to its negative aspects also grew.

According to Michel Foucault, there was a shift in the perception of madness, whereby it came to be seen as less about delusion, i.e. disturbed judgment about the truth, than about a disorder of regular, normal behavior or will. Foucault argued that, prior to this, doctors could often prescribe travel, rest, walking, retirement and generally engaging with nature, seen as the visible form of truth, as a means to break with artificialities of the world (and therefore delusions). Another form of treatment involved nature&#x27;s opposite, the theater, where the patient&#x27;s madness was acted out for him or her in such a way that the delusion would reveal itself to the patient.

Thus the most prominent therapeutic technique became to confront patients with a healthy sound will and orthodox passions, ideally embodied by the physician . The &quot;cure&quot; involved a process of opposition, of struggle and domination, of the patient&#x27;s troubled will by the healthy will of the physician. It was thought the confrontation would lead not only to bring the illness into broad daylight by its resistance, but also to the victory of the sound will and the renunciation of the disturbed will. &quot;We must apply a perturbing method, to break the spasm by means of the spasm... We must subjugate the whole character of some patients, subdue their transports, break their pride, while we must stimulate and encourage the others&quot; (Esquirol, J.E.D., 1816). Foucault also argued that the increasing internment of the &quot;mentally ill&quot; (the development of more and bigger asylums) had become necessary not just for diagnosis and classification but because an enclosed place became a requirement for a treatment that was now understood as primarily the contest of wills, a question of submission and victory.
The techniques and procedures of the asylums at this time included &quot;isolation, private or public interrogations, punishment techniques such as cold showers, moral talks (encouragements or reprimands), strict discipline, compulsory work, rewards, preferential relations between the physician and his patients, relations of vassalage, of possession, of domesticity, even of servitude between patient and physician at times&quot;. Foucault summarized these as &quot;designed to make the medical personage the &#x27;master of madness&#x27;&quot; through the power the physician&#x27;s will exerts on the patient. The effect of this shift then served to inflate the power of the physician relative to the patient, correlated with the rapid rise of internment (asylums and forced detention).

Other analyses suggest that the rise of asylums was primarily driven by industrialization and capitalism, including the breakdown of traditional family structures. By the end of the 19th century, psychiatrists often had little power in the overcrowded asylum system, acting mainly as administrators who rarely attended to patients in a system where therapeutic ideals had turned into institutional routines. In general, critics point to negative aspects of the shift toward so-called &quot;moral treatments&quot;, and the concurrent widespread expansion of asylums, medical power and involuntary hospitalization laws, that played an important part in the development of the anti-psychiatry movement.
Various 19th-century critiques of the newly emerging field of psychiatry overlap thematically with 20th-century anti-psychiatry, for example in their questioning of the medicalization of &quot;madness&quot;. Those critiques occurred at a time when physicians had not yet achieved hegemony through psychiatry, however, so there was no single, unified force to oppose. Nevertheless, there was increasing concern at the ease with which people could be confined, with frequent reports of abuse and illegal confinement. For example, Daniel Defoe, the author of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, had previously argued for more government oversight of &quot;madhouses&quot; and for due process prior to involuntary internment. He later argued that husbands used asylum hospitals to incarcerate their disobedient wives, and in a subsequent pamphlet that wives even did the same to their husbands. It was also proposed that the role of asylum keeper be separated from doctor, to discourage exploitation of patients. There was general concern that physicians were undermining personhood by medicalizing problems, by claiming they alone had the expertise to judge, and by arguing that mental disorder was physical and hereditary. The Alleged Lunatics&#x27; Friend Society arose in England in the mid-19th century to challenge the system and campaign for rights and reforms. In the United States, Elizabeth Packard published a series of books and pamphlets describing her experiences in the Illinois insane asylum, to which she had been committed at the request of her husband.

Throughout, the class nature of mental hospitals and their role as agencies of control were well recognized. The new psychiatry was partially challenged by two powerful social institutions – the church and the legal system. These trends have been thematically linked to the later 20th century anti-psychiatry movement.

As psychiatry became more professionally established during the nineteenth century (the term itself was coined in 1808 in Germany by Johann Christian Reil, as &quot;Psychiaterie&quot;) and developed allegedly more invasive treatments, opposition increased. In the Southern US, black slaves and abolitionists encountered drapetomania, a pseudo-scientific diagnosis that presented the desire of slaves to run away from their masters as a symptom of pathology.

There was some organized challenge to psychiatry in the late 1870s from the new speciality of neurology, largely centered around control of state insane asylums in New York. Practitioners criticized mental hospitals for failure to conduct scientific research and adopt the modern therapeutic methods such as nonrestraint. Together with lay reformers and social workers, neurologists formed the National Association for the Protection of the Insane and the Prevention of Insanity. However, when the lay members questioned the competence of asylum physicians to even provide proper care at all, the neurologists withdrew their support and the association floundered.

=== Early 1900s ===
It has been noted that &quot;the most persistent critics of psychiatry have always been former mental hospital patients&quot;, but that very few were able to tell their stories publicly or to confront the psychiatric establishment openly, and those who did so were commonly considered so extreme in their charges that they could seldom gain credibility. In the early 20th century, ex-patient Clifford W. Beers campaigned to improve the plight of individuals receiving public psychiatric care, particularly those committed to state institutions, publicizing the issues in his book, &quot;A Mind that Found Itself&quot; (1908). While Beers initially condemned psychiatrists for tolerating mistreatment of patients, and envisioned more ex-patient involvement in the movement, he was influenced by Adolf Meyer and the psychiatric establishment, and toned down his hostility since he needed their support for reforms. In Germany during this time were similar efforts which used the term &quot;Antipsychiatrie&quot;.

Beers&#x27; reliance on rich donors and his need for approval from experts led him to hand over to psychiatrists the organization he helped found, the National Committee for Mental Hygiene, which eventually became the National Mental Health Association. In the UK, the National Society for Lunacy Law Reform was established in 1920 by angry ex-patients who sought justice for abuses committed in psychiatric custody, and were aggrieved that their complaints were patronizingly discounted by the authorities, who were seen to value the availability of medicalized internment as a &#x27;whitewashed&#x27; extrajudicial custodial and punitive process. In 1922, ex-patient Rachel Grant-Smith added to calls for reform of the system of neglect and abuse she had suffered by publishing &quot;The Experiences of an Asylum Patient&quot;. In the US, We Are Not Alone (WANA) was founded by a group of patients at Rockland State Hospital in New York, and continued to meet as an ex-patient group.

French surrealist Antonin Artaud would also openly criticize that no patient should be labeled as &quot;mentally ill&quot; as an exterior identification, as he notes in his 1925 &quot;L&#x27;Ombilic des limbes&quot;, as well as arguing against narcotic&#x27;s restriction laws in France. Much influenced by the Dada and surrealist enthusiasms of the day, he considered dreams, thoughts and visions no less real than the &quot;outside&quot; world.
In this era before penicillin was discovered, eugenics was popular. People believed diseases of the mind could be passed on so compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill was enacted in many countries.

=== 1930s ===
In the 1930s several controversial medical practices were introduced and framed as &quot;treatments&quot; for mental disorders, including inducing seizures (by electroshock, insulin or other drugs) or psychosurgery (lobotomy). In the US, beginning in 1939 through 1951, over 50,000 lobotomy operations were performed in mental hospitals, a procedure ultimately seen as inhumane.

Holocaust historians argued that the medicalization of social programs and systematic euthanasia of people in German mental institutions in the 1930s provided the institutional, procedural, and doctrinal origins of the mass murder of the 1940s. The Nazi programs were called Action T4 and Action 14f13. The Nuremberg Trials convicted a number of psychiatrists who held key positions in Nazi regimes. As one Swiss psychiatrist stated: &quot;A not so easy question to be answered is whether it should be allowed to destroy lives objectively &#x27;unworthy of living&#x27; without the expressed request of its bearers. (...) Even in incurable mentally ill ones suffering seriously from hallucinations and melancholic depressions and not being able to act, to a medical colleague I would ascript the right and in serious cases the duty to shorten — often for many years — the suffering&quot; (Bleuler, Eugen, 1936: &quot;Die naturwissenschaftliche Grundlage der Ethik&quot;. Schweizer Archiv Neurologie und Psychiatrie, Band 38, Nr.2, S. 206).

=== 1940s and 1950s ===
The post-World War II decades saw an enormous growth in psychiatry; many Americans were persuaded that psychiatry and psychology, particularly psychoanalysis, were a key to happiness. Meanwhile, most hospitalized mental patients received at best decent custodial care, and at worst, abuse and neglect.

The psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan has been identified as an influence on later anti-psychiatry theory in the UK, and as being the first, in the 1940s and 50s, to professionally challenge psychoanalysis to reexamine its concepts and to appreciate psychosis as understandable. Other influences on Lacan included poetry and the surrealist movement, including the poetic power of patients&#x27; experiences. Critics disputed this and questioned how his descriptions linked to his practical work. The names that came to be associated with the anti-psychiatry movement knew of Lacan and acknowledged his contribution even if they did not entirely agree. The psychoanalyst Erich Fromm is also said to have articulated, in the 1950s, the secular humanistic concern of the coming anti-psychiatry movement. In &quot;The Sane Society&quot; (1955), Fromm wrote &quot;An unhealthy society is one which creates mutual hostility [and] distrust, which transforms man into an instrument of use and exploitation for others, which deprives him of a sense of self, except inasmuch as he submits to others or becomes an automaton&quot;...&quot;Yet many psychiatrists and psychologists refuse to entertain the idea that society as a whole may be lacking in sanity. They hold that the problem of mental health in a society is only that of the number of &#x27;unadjusted&#x27; individuals, and not of a possible unadjustment of the culture itself&quot;.

In the 1950s new psychiatric drugs, notably the antipsychotic chlorpromazine, slowly came into use. Although often accepted as an advance in some ways, there was opposition, partly due to serious adverse effects such as tardive dyskinesia, and partly due their &quot;chemical straitjacket&quot; effect and their alleged use to control and intimidate patients. Patients often opposed psychiatry and refused or stopped taking the drugs when not subject to psychiatric control. There was also increasing opposition to the large-scale use of psychiatric hospitals and institutions, and attempts were made to develop services in the community.
According to the Encyclopedia of Theory and Practice in Psychotherapy and Counseling, &quot;In the 1950s in the United States, a right-wing anti-mental health movement opposed psychiatry, seeing it as liberal, left-wing, subversive and anti-American or pro-Communist. There were widespread fears that it threatened individual rights and undermined moral responsibility. An early skirmish was over the Alaska Mental Health Bill, where the right wing protestors were joined by the emerging Scientology movement.&quot;

The field of psychology sometimes came into opposition with psychiatry. Behaviorists argued that mental disorder was a matter of learning not medicine; for example, Hans Eysenck argued that psychiatry &quot;really has no role to play&quot;. The developing field of clinical psychology in particular came into close contact with psychiatry, often in opposition to its methods, theories and territories.

=== 1960s ===
Coming to the fore in the 1960s, &quot;anti-psychiatry&quot; (a term first used by David Cooper in 1967) defined a movement that vocally challenged the fundamental claims and practices of mainstream psychiatry. While most of its elements had precedents in earlier decades and centuries, in the 1960s it took on a national and international character, with access to the mass media and incorporating a wide mixture of grassroots activist organizations and prestigious professional bodies.

Cooper was a South African psychiatrist working in Britain. A trained Marxist revolutionary, he argued that the political context of psychiatry and its patients had to be highlighted and radically challenged, and warned that the fog of individualized therapeutic language could take away people&#x27;s ability to see and challenge the bigger social picture. He spoke of having a goal of &quot;non-psychiatry&quot; as well as anti-psychiatry.

::In the 1960s fresh voices mounted a new challenge to the pretensions of psychiatry as a science and the mental health system as a successful humanitarian enterprise. These voices included: Ernest Becker, Erving Goffman, R.D. Laing; Laing and Aaron Esterson, Thomas Scheff, and Thomas Szasz. Their writings, along with others such as articles in the journal &quot;The Radical Therapist&quot;, were given the umbrella label &quot;antipsychiatry&quot; despite wide divergences in philosophy. This critical literature, in concert with an activist movement, emphasized the hegemony of medical model psychiatry, its spurious sources of authority, its mystification of human problems, and the more oppressive practices of the mental health system, such as involuntary hospitalisation, drugging, and electroshock.

The psychiatrists R D Laing (from Scotland), Theodore Lidz (from America), Silvano Arieti (from Italy) and others, argued that &quot;schizophrenia&quot; and psychosis were understandable, and resulted from injuries to the inner-self-inflicted by psychologically invasive &quot;schizophrenogenic&quot; parents or others. It was sometimes seen as a transformative state involving an attempt to cope with a sick society. Laing, however, partially dissociated himself from his colleague Cooper&#x27;s term &quot;anti-psychiatry&quot;. Laing had already become a media icon through bestselling books (such as &quot;The Divided Self&quot; and &quot;The Politics of Experience&quot;) discussing mental distress in an interpersonal existential context; Laing was somewhat less focused than his colleague Cooper on wider social structures and radical left wing politics, and went on to develop more romanticized or mystical views (as well as equivocating over the use of diagnosis, drugs and commitment). Although the movement originally described as anti-psychiatry became associated with the general counter-culture movement of the 1960s, Lidz and Arieti never became involved in the latter. Franco Basaglia promoted anti-psychiatry in Italy and secured reforms to mental health law there.

Laing, through the Philadelphia Association founded with Cooper in 1965, set up over 20 therapeutic communities including Kingsley Hall, where staff and residents theoretically assumed equal status and any medication used was voluntary. Non-psychiatric Soteria houses, starting in the United States, were also developed as were various ex-patient-led services.

Psychiatrist Thomas Szasz argued that &quot;mental illness&quot; is an inherently incoherent combination of a medical and a psychological concept. He opposed the use of psychiatry to forcibly detain, treat, or excuse what he saw as mere deviance from societal norms or moral conduct. As a libertarian, Szasz was concerned that such usage undermined personal rights and moral responsibility. Adherents of his views referred to &quot;the myth of mental illness&quot;, after Szasz&#x27;s controversial 1961 book of that name (based on a paper of the same name that Szasz had written in 1957 that, following repeated rejections from psychiatric journals, had been published in the American Psychologist in 1960). Although widely described as part of the main anti-psychiatry movement, Szasz actively rejected the term and its adherents; instead, in 1969, he collaborated with Scientology to form the Citizens Commission on Human Rights. It was later noted that the view that insanity was not in most or even in any instances a &quot;medical&quot; entity, but a moral issue, was also held by Christian Scientists and certain Protestant fundamentalists, as well as Szasz. Szasz was not a Scientologist himself and was non-religious; he commented frequently on the parallels between religion and psychiatry.

Erving Goffman, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari and others criticized the power and role of psychiatry in society, including the use of &quot;total institutions&quot; and the use of models and terms that were seen as stigmatizing. The French sociologist and philosopher Foucault, in his 1961 publication &quot;Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason&quot;, analyzed how attitudes towards those deemed &quot;insane&quot; had changed as a result of changes in social values. He argued that psychiatry was primarily a tool of social control, based historically on a &quot;great confinement&quot; of the insane and physical punishment and chains, later exchanged in the moral treatment era for psychological oppression and internalized restraint. American sociologist Thomas Scheff applied labeling theory to psychiatry in 1966 in &quot;Being Mentally Ill&quot;. Scheff argued that society views certain actions as deviant and, in order to come to terms with and understand these actions, often places the label of mental illness on those who exhibit them. Certain expectations are then placed on these individuals and, over time, they unconsciously change their behavior to fulfill them.

Observation of the abuses of psychiatry in the Soviet Union in the so-called Psikhushka hospitals also led to questioning the validity of the practice of psychiatry in the West. In particular, the diagnosis of many political dissidents with schizophrenia led some to question the general diagnosis and punitive usage of the label schizophrenia. This raised questions as to whether the schizophrenia label and resulting involuntary psychiatric treatment could not have been similarly used in the West to subdue rebellious young people during family conflicts.

=== Since 1970 ===

New professional approaches were developed as an alternative or reformist complement to psychiatry. &quot;The Radical Therapist&quot;, a journal begun in 1971 in North Dakota by Michael Glenn, David Bryan, Linda Bryan, Michael Galan and Sara Glenn, challenged the psychotherapy establishment in a number of ways, raising the slogan &quot;Therapy means change, not adjustment.&quot; It contained articles that challenged the professional mediator approach, advocating instead revolutionary politics and authentic community making. Social work, humanistic or existentialist therapies, family therapy, counseling and self-help and clinical psychology developed and sometimes opposed psychiatry.

The psychoanalytically trained psychiatrist Szasz, although professing fundamental opposition to what he perceives as medicalization and oppressive or excuse-giving &quot;diagnosis&quot; and forced &quot;treatment&quot;, was not opposed to other aspects of psychiatry (for example attempts to &quot;cure-heal souls&quot;, although he also characterizes this as non-medical). Although generally considered anti-psychiatry by others, he sought to dissociate himself politically from a movement and term associated with the radical left-wing. In a 1976 publication &quot;Anti-psychiatry: The paradigm of a plundered mind&quot;, which has been described as an overtly political condemnation of a wide sweep of people, Szasz claimed Laing, Cooper and all of anti-psychiatry consisted of &quot;self-declared socialists, communists, anarchists or at least anti-capitalists and collectivists&quot;. While saying he shared some of their critique of the psychiatric system, Szasz compared their views on the social causes of distress/deviance to those of anti-capitalist anti-colonialists who claimed that Chilean poverty was due to plundering by American companies, a comment Szasz made not long after a CIA-backed coup had deposed the democratically elected Chilean president and replaced him with Pinochet. Szasz argued instead that distress/deviance is due to the flaws or failures of individuals in their struggles in life.

The anti-psychiatry movement was also being driven by individuals with adverse experiences of psychiatric services. This included those who felt they had been harmed by psychiatry or who felt that they could have been helped more by other approaches, including those compulsorily (including via physical force) admitted to psychiatric institutions and subjected to compulsory medication or procedures. During the 1970s, the anti-psychiatry movement was involved in promoting restraint from many practices seen as psychiatric abuses.

The gay rights movement continued to challenge the classification of homosexuality as a mental illness and in 1974, in a climate of controversy and activism, the American Psychiatric Association membership (following a unanimous vote by the trustees in 1973) voted by a small majority (58%) to remove it as an illness category from the DSM, replacing it with a category of &quot;sexual orientation disturbance&quot; and then &quot;ego-dystonic homosexuality,&quot; which was deleted in 1986, although a wide variety of &quot;paraphilias&quot; remain. 

The diagnostic label gender identity disorder (GID) was used by the DSM until its reclassification as &quot;gender dysphoria&quot; in 2013, with the release of the DSM-5. The diagnosis was reclassified to better align it with medical understanding of the condition and to remove the stigma associated with the term &quot;disorder&quot;. The American Psychiatric Association, publisher of the DSM-5, stated that gender nonconformity is not the same thing as gender dysphoria, and that &quot;gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder. The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.&quot; Some transgender people and researchers support declassification of the condition because they say the diagnosis pathologizes gender variance and reinforces the binary model of gender. Szasz also publicly endorsed the transmisogynist work of Janice Raymond. In a 1979 &quot;New York Times&quot; book review of Raymond&#x27;s &quot;The Transsexual Empire&quot;, Szasz drew connections between his ongoing critique of psychiatric diagnosis and Raymond&#x27;s feminist critique of trans women.

Increased legal and professional protections, and a merging with human rights and disability rights movements, added to anti-psychiatry theory and action.

Anti-psychiatry came to challenge a &quot;biomedical&quot; focus of psychiatry (defined to mean genetics, neurochemicals and pharmaceutic drugs). There was also opposition to the increasing links between psychiatry and pharmaceutical companies, which were becoming more powerful and were increasingly claimed to have excessive, unjustified and underhand influence on psychiatric research and practice. There was also opposition to the codification of, and alleged misuse of, psychiatric diagnoses into manuals, in particular the American Psychiatric Association, which publishes the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;.

Anti-psychiatry increasingly challenged alleged psychiatric pessimism and institutionalized alienation regarding those categorized as mentally ill. An emerging consumer/survivor movement often argues for full recovery, empowerment, self-management and even full liberation. Schemes were developed to challenge stigma and discrimination, often based on a social model of disability; to assist or encourage people with mental health issues to engage more fully in work and society (for example through social firms), and to involve service users in the delivery and evaluation of mental health services. However, those actively and openly challenging the fundamental ethics and efficacy of mainstream psychiatric practice remained marginalized within psychiatry, and to a lesser extent within the wider mental health community.

Three authors came to personify the movement against psychiatry, and two of these were practicing psychiatrists. The initial and most influential of these was Thomas Szasz who rose to fame with his book &quot;The Myth of Mental Illness&quot;, although Szasz himself did not identify as an anti-psychiatrist. The well-respected R D Laing wrote a series of best-selling books, including &quot;The Divided Self&quot;. Intellectual philosopher Michel Foucault challenged the very basis of psychiatric practice and cast it as repressive and controlling. The term &quot;anti-psychiatry&quot; was coined by David Cooper in 1967. In parallel with the theoretical production of the mentioned authors, the Italian physician Giorgio Antonucci questioned the basis themselves of psychiatry through the dismantling of the psychiatric hospitals&quot; Osservanza&quot; and &quot;Luigi Lolli&quot; and the liberation – and restitution to life – of the people there secluded.

== Challenges to psychiatry ==

=== Civilization as a cause of distress ===
In recent years, psychotherapists David Smail and Bruce E. Levine, considered part of the anti-psychiatry movement, have written widely on how society, culture, politics and psychology intersect. They have written extensively of the &quot;embodied nature&quot; of the individual in society, and the unwillingness of even therapists to acknowledge the obvious part played by power and financial interest in modern Western society. They argue that feelings and emotions are not, as is commonly supposed, features of the individual, but rather responses of the individual to their situation in society. Even psychotherapy, they suggest, can only change feelings in as much as it helps a person to change the &quot;proximal&quot; and &quot;distal&quot; influences on their life, which range from family and friends, to the workplace, socio-economics, politics and culture.

R. D. Laing emphasized family nexus as a mechanism by which individuals become victimized by those around them, and spoke about a dysfunctional society.

=== Inadequacy of clinical interviews used to diagnose &#x27;diseases&#x27; ===

Psychiatrists have been trying to differentiate mental disorders based on clinical interviews since the era of Kraepelin, but now realize that their diagnostic criteria are imperfect. Tadafumi Kato writes, &quot;We psychiatrists should be aware that we cannot identify &#x27;diseases&#x27; only by interviews. What we are doing now is just like trying to diagnose diabetes mellitus without measuring blood sugar.&quot;

=== Normality and illness judgments ===
In 2013, psychiatrist Allen Frances said that &quot;psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests&quot;.

Reasons have been put forward to doubt the ontic status of mental disorders. Mental disorders engender ontological skepticism on three levels:
# Mental disorders are abstract entities that cannot be directly appreciated with the human senses or indirectly, as one might with macro- or microscopic objects.
# Mental disorders are not clearly natural processes whose detection is untarnished by the imposition of values, or human interpretation.
# It is unclear whether they should be conceived as abstractions that exist in the world apart from the individual persons who experience them, and thus instantiate them.

In the scientific and academic literature on the definition or classification of mental disorder, one extreme argues that it is entirely a matter of value judgements (including of what is normal) while another proposes that it is or could be entirely objective and scientific (including by reference to statistical norms). Common hybrid views argue that the concept of mental disorder is objective but a &quot;fuzzy prototype&quot; that can never be precisely defined, or alternatively that it inevitably involves a mix of scientific facts and subjective value judgments.

One remarkable example of psychiatric diagnosis being used to reinforce cultural bias and oppress dissidence is the diagnosis of drapetomania. In the US prior to the American Civil War, physicians such as Samuel A. Cartwright diagnosed some slaves with drapetomania, a mental illness in which the slave possessed an irrational desire for freedom and a tendency to try to escape. By classifying such a dissident mental trait as abnormal and a disease, psychiatry promoted cultural bias about normality, abnormality, health, and unhealth. This example indicates the probability for not only cultural bias but also confirmation bias and bias blind spot in psychiatric diagnosis and psychiatric beliefs.

It has been argued by philosophers like Foucault that characterizations of &quot;mental illness&quot; are indeterminate and reflect the hierarchical structures of the societies from which they emerge rather than any precisely defined qualities that distinguish a &quot;healthy&quot; mind from a &quot;sick&quot; one. Furthermore, if a tendency toward self-harm is taken as an elementary symptom of mental illness, then humans, &quot;as a species&quot;, are arguably insane in that they have tended throughout recorded history to destroy their own environments, to make war with one another, etc.

=== Psychiatric labeling ===

Mental disorders were first included in the sixth revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-6) in 1949. Three years later, the American Psychiatric Association created its own classification system, DSM-I. The definitions of most psychiatric diagnoses consist of combinations of phenomenological criteria, such as symptoms and signs and their course over time. Expert committees combined them in variable ways into categories of mental disorders, defined and redefined them again and again over the last half century.

The majority of these diagnostic categories are called &quot;disorders&quot; and are not validated by biological criteria, as most medical diseases are; although they purport to represent medical diseases and take the form of medical diagnoses. These diagnostic categories are actually embedded in top-down classifications, similar to the early botanic classifications of plants in the 17th and 18th centuries, when experts decided a priori about which classification criterion to use, for instance, whether the shape of leaves or fruiting bodies were the main criterion for classifying plants. Since the era of Kraepelin, psychiatrists have been trying to differentiate mental disorders by using clinical interviews.

====Experiments admitting &quot;healthy&quot; individuals into psychiatric care====
In 1972, psychologist David Rosenhan published the Rosenhan experiment, a study questioning the validity of psychiatric diagnoses. The study arranged for eight individuals with no history of psychopathology to attempt admission into psychiatric hospitals. The individuals included a graduate student, psychologists, an artist, a housewife, and two physicians, including one psychiatrist. All eight individuals were admitted with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Psychiatrists then attempted to treat the individuals using psychiatric medication. All eight were discharged within 7 to 52 days. In a later part of the study, psychiatric staff were warned that pseudo-patients might be sent to their institutions, but none were actually sent. Nevertheless, a total of 83 patients out of 193 were believed by at least one staff member to be actors. The study concluded that individuals without mental disorders were indistinguishable from those with mental disorders.

Critics such as Robert Spitzer cast doubt on the validity and credibility of the study, but did concede that the consistency of psychiatric diagnoses needed improvement. The challenge of the validity versus the reliability of diagnostic categories continues to plague diagnostic systems. Neuroscientist Tadafumi Kato advocates for a new classification of diseases based on the neurobiological features of each mental disorder. while Austrian psychiatrist Heinz Katsching advises psychiatrists to replace the term &quot;mental illness&quot; by &quot;brain illness.&quot;

There are recognized problems regarding the diagnostic reliability and validity of mainstream psychiatric diagnoses, both in ideal and controlled circumstances and even more so in routine clinical practice (McGorry &quot;et al.&quot;. 1995). Criteria in the principal diagnostic manuals, the DSM and ICD, are not consistent between the two manuals. Some psychiatrists in critiquing diagnostic criteria point out that comorbidity, when an individual meets criteria for two or more disorders, is the rule rather than the exception, casting doubt on the distinctness of the categories, with overlap and vaguely defined or changeable boundaries between what are asserted to be distinct disorders.

Other concerns raised include using standard diagnostic criteria in different countries, cultures, genders or ethnic groups. Critics contend that Westernized, white, male-dominated psychiatric practices and diagnoses disadvantage and misunderstand those from other groups. For example, several studies have shown that African Americans are more often diagnosed with schizophrenia than white people, and men more than women. Some within the anti-psychiatry movement are critical of the use of diagnosis at all as it conforms with the biomedical model, seen as illegitimate.

=== Tool of social control ===

According to Franco Basaglia, Giorgio Antonucci, and Bruce E. Levine, whose approach pointed out the role of psychiatric institutions in the control and medicalization of deviant behaviors and social problems, psychiatry is used as the provider of scientific support for social control to the existing establishment, and the ensuing standards of deviance and normality brought about repressive views of discrete social groups. According to Mike Fitzpatrick, resistance to medicalization was a common theme of the gay liberation, anti-psychiatry, and feminist movements of the 1970s, but now there is actually no resistance to the advance of government intrusion in lifestyle if it is thought to be justified in terms of public health.

In the opinion of Mike Fitzpatrick, the pressure for medicalization also comes from society itself. As one example, Fitzpatrick claims that feminists who once opposed state intervention as oppressive and patriarchal, now demand more coercive and intrusive measures to deal with child abuse and domestic violence. According to Richard Gosden, the use of psychiatry as a tool of social control is becoming obvious in preventive medicine programs for various mental diseases. These programs are intended to identify children and young people with divergent behavioral patterns and thinking and send them to treatment before their supposed mental diseases develop. Clinical guidelines for best practice in Australia include the risk factors and signs which can be used to detect young people who are in need of prophylactic drug treatment to prevent the development of schizophrenia and other psychotic conditions.

=== Psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry ===
Critics of psychiatry commonly express a concern that the path of diagnosis and treatment in contemporary society is primarily or overwhelmingly shaped by profit prerogatives, echoing a common criticism of general medical practice in the United States, where many of the largest psychopharmaceutical producers are based.

Psychiatric research has demonstrated varying degrees of efficacy for improving or managing a number of mental health disorders through either medications, psychotherapy, or a combination of the two. Typical psychiatric medications include stimulants, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics (neuroleptics).

On the other hand, organizations such as MindFreedom International and World Network of Users and Survivors of Psychiatry maintain that psychiatrists exaggerate the evidence of medication and minimize the evidence of adverse drug reaction. They and other activists believe individuals are not given balanced information, and that current psychiatric medications do not appear to be specific to particular disorders in the way mainstream psychiatry asserts; and psychiatric drugs not only fail to correct measurable chemical imbalances in the brain, but rather induce undesirable side effects. For example, though children on Ritalin and other psycho-stimulants become more obedient to parents and teachers, critics have noted that they can also develop abnormal movements such as tics, spasms and other involuntary movements. This has not been shown to be directly related to the therapeutic use of stimulants, but to neuroleptics. The diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder on the basis of inattention to compulsory schooling also raises critics&#x27; concerns regarding the use of psychoactive drugs as a means of unjust social control of children.

The influence of pharmaceutical companies is another major issue for the anti-psychiatry movement. As many critics from within and outside of psychiatry have argued, there are many financial and professional links between psychiatry, regulators, and pharmaceutical companies. Drug companies routinely fund much of the research conducted by psychiatrists, advertise medication in psychiatric journals and conferences, fund psychiatric and healthcare organizations and health promotion campaigns, and send representatives to lobby general physicians and politicians. Peter Breggin, Sharkey, and other investigators of the psycho-pharmaceutical industry maintain that many psychiatrists are members, shareholders or special advisors to pharmaceutical or associated regulatory organizations.

There is evidence that research findings and the prescribing of drugs are influenced as a result. A United Kingdom cross-party parliamentary inquiry into the influence of the pharmaceutical industry in 2005 concludes: &quot;The influence of the pharmaceutical industry is such that it dominates clinical practice&quot; and that there are serious regulatory failings resulting in &quot;the unsafe use of drugs; and the increasing medicalization of society&quot;. The campaign organization &quot;No Free Lunch&quot; details the prevalent acceptance by medical professionals of free gifts from pharmaceutical companies and the effect on psychiatric practice. The ghostwriting of articles by pharmaceutical company officials, which are then presented by esteemed psychiatrists, has also been highlighted. Systematic reviews have found that trials of psychiatric drugs that are conducted with pharmaceutical funding are several times more likely to report positive findings than studies without such funding.

The number of psychiatric drug prescriptions have been increasing at an extremely high rate since the 1950s and show no sign of abating. In the United States antidepressants and tranquilizers are now the top selling class of prescription drugs, and neuroleptics and other psychiatric drugs also rank near the top, all with expanding sales. As a solution to the apparent conflict of interests, critics propose legislation to separate the pharmaceutical industry from the psychiatric profession.

John Read and Bruce E. Levine have advanced the idea of socioeconomic status as a significant factor in the development and prevention of mental disorders such as schizophrenia and have noted the reach of pharmaceutical companies through industry sponsored websites as promoting a more biological approach to mental disorders, rather than a comprehensive biological, psychological and social model.

=== Electroconvulsive therapy ===
Psychiatrists may advocate psychiatric drugs, psychotherapy or more controversial interventions such as electroshock or psychosurgery to treat mental illness. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is administered worldwide typically for severe mental disorders. Across the globe it has been estimated that approximately 1 million patients receive ECT per year. Exact numbers of how many persons per year have ECT in the United States are unknown due to the variability of settings and treatment. Researchers&#x27; estimates generally range from 100,000 to 200,000 persons per year.

Some persons receiving ECT die during the procedure (ECT is performed under a general anesthetic, which always carries a risk). Leonard Roy Frank writes that estimates of ECT-related death rates vary widely. The lower estimates include: 
*2–4 in 100,000 (from Kramer&#x27;s 1994 study of 28,437 patients) 
*1 in 10,000 (Boodman&#x27;s first entry in 1996)
*1 in 1,000 (Impastato&#x27;s first entry in 1957)
*1 in 200, among the elderly, over 60 (Impastato&#x27;s in 1957) 
Higher estimates include:
*1 in 102 (Martin&#x27;s entry in 1949)
*1 in 95 (Boodman&#x27;s first entry in 1996)
*1 in 92 (Freeman and Kendell&#x27;s entry in 1976)
*1 in 89 (Sagebiel&#x27;s in 1961)
*1 in 69 (Gralnick&#x27;s in 1946)
*1 in 63, among a group undergoing intensive ECT (Perry&#x27;s in 1963–1979)
*1 in 38 (Ehrenberg&#x27;s in 1955)
*1 in 30 (Kurland&#x27;s in 1959)
*1 in 9, among a group undergoing intensive ECT (Weil&#x27;s in 1949)
*1 in 4, among the very elderly, over 80 (Kroessler and Fogel&#x27;s in 1974–1986).

=== Political abuse of psychiatry ===


Psychiatrists around the world have been involved in the suppression of individual rights by states in which the definitions of mental disease have been expanded to include political disobedience. Nowadays, in many countries, political prisoners are sometimes confined and abused in mental institutions. Psychiatry possesses a built-in capacity for abuse which is greater than in other areas of medicine. The diagnosis of mental disease can serve as proxy for the designation of social dissidents, allowing the state to hold persons against their will and to insist upon therapies that work in favor of ideological conformity and in the broader interests of society. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.

Under the Nazi regime in the 1940s, the &quot;duty to care&quot; was violated on an enormous scale. In Germany alone 300,000 individuals that had been deemed mentally ill, work-shy or feeble-minded were sterilized. An additional 200,000 were euthanized. These practices continued in territories occupied by the Nazis further afield (mainly in eastern Europe), affecting thousands more. From the 1960s up to 1986, political abuse of psychiatry was reported to be systematic in the Soviet Union, and to surface on occasion in other Eastern European countries such as Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, as well as in Western European countries, such as Italy. An example of the use of psychiatry in the political field is the &quot;case Sabattini&quot;, described by Giorgio Antonucci in his book &quot;Il pregiudizio psichiatrico&quot;. A &quot;mental health genocide&quot; reminiscent of the Nazi aberrations has been located in the history of South African oppression during the apartheid era. A continued misappropriation of the discipline was later attributed to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

K. Fulford, A. Smirnov, and E. Snow state: &quot;An important vulnerability factor, therefore, for the abuse of psychiatry, is the subjective nature of the observations on which psychiatric diagnosis currently depends.&quot; In an article published in 1994 by the &quot;Journal of Medical Ethics&quot;, American psychiatrist Thomas Szasz stated that &quot;the classification by slave owners and slave traders of certain individuals as Negroes was scientific, in the sense that whites were rarely classified as blacks. But that did not prevent the &#x27;abuse&#x27; of such racial classification, because (what we call) its abuse was, in fact, its use.&quot; Szasz argued that the spectacle of the Western psychiatrists loudly condemning Soviet colleagues for their abuse of professional standards was largely an exercise in hypocrisy. Szasz states that K. Fulford, A. Smirnov, and E. Snow, who correctly emphasize the value-laden nature of psychiatric diagnoses and the subjective character of psychiatric classifications, fail to accept the role of psychiatric power. He stated that psychiatric abuse, such as people usually associated with practices in the former USSR, was connected not with the misuse of psychiatric diagnoses, but with the political power built into the social role of the psychiatrist in democratic and totalitarian societies alike. Musicologists, drama critics, art historians, and many other scholars also create their own subjective classifications; however, lacking state-legitimated power over persons, their classifications do not lead to anyone&#x27;s being deprived of property, liberty, or life. For instance, a plastic surgeon&#x27;s classification of beauty is subjective, but the plastic surgeon cannot treat his or her patient without the patient&#x27;s consent, so there cannot be any political abuse of plastic surgery.

The bedrock of political medicine is coercion masquerading as medical treatment. In this process, physicians diagnose a disapproved condition as an &quot;illness&quot; and declare the intervention they impose on the victim a &quot;treatment,&quot; and legislators and judges legitimate these categorizations. In the same way, physician-eugenicists advocated killing certain disabled or ill persons as a form of treatment for both society and patient long before the Nazis came to power.

From the commencement of his political career, Hitler put his struggle against &quot;enemies of the state&quot; in medical rhetoric. In 1934, addressing the Reichstag, he declared, &quot;I gave the order… to burn out down to the raw flesh the ulcers of our internal well-poisoning.&quot; The entire German nation and its National Socialist politicians learned to think and speak in such terms. Werner Best, Reinhard Heydrich&#x27;s deputy, stated that the task of the police was &quot;to root out all symptoms of disease and germs of destruction that threatened the political health of the nation… [In addition to Jews,] most [of the germs] were weak, unpopular and marginalized groups, such as gypsies, homosexuals, beggars, &#x27;antisocials&#x27;, &#x27;work-shy&#x27;, and &#x27;habitual criminals&#x27;.&quot;

In spite of all the evidence, people ignore or underappreciate the political implications of the pseudotherapeutic character of Nazism and of the use of medical metaphors in modern democracies. Dismissed as an &quot;abuse of psychiatry&quot;, this practice is a controversial subject not because the story makes psychiatrists in Nazi Germany look bad, but because it highlights the dramatic similarities between pharmacratic controls in Germany under Nazism and those that have emerged in the US under the free market economy.

=== Therapeutic state ===
The &quot;therapeutic state&quot; is a phrase coined by Szasz in 1963. The collaboration between psychiatry and government leads to what Szasz calls the &quot;therapeutic state&quot;, a system in which disapproved actions, thoughts, and emotions are repressed (&quot;cured&quot;) through pseudomedical interventions. Thus suicide, unconventional religious beliefs, racial bigotry, unhappiness, anxiety, shyness, sexual promiscuity, shoplifting, gambling, overeating, smoking, and illegal drug use are all considered symptoms or illnesses that need to be cured. When faced with demands for measures to curtail smoking in public, binge-drinking, gambling or obesity, ministers say that &quot;we must guard against charges of nanny statism&quot;. The &quot;nanny state&quot; has turned into the &quot;therapeutic state&quot; where nanny has given way to counselor. Nanny just told people what to do; counselors also tell them what to think and what to feel. The &quot;nanny state&quot; was punitive, austere, and authoritarian, the therapeutic state is touchy-feely, supportive—and even more authoritarian. According to Szasz, &quot;the therapeutic state swallows up everything human on the seemingly rational ground that nothing falls outside the province of health and medicine, just as the theological state had swallowed up everything human on the perfectly rational ground that nothing falls outside the province of God and religion&quot;.

Faced with the problem of &quot;madness&quot;, Western individualism proved to be ill-prepared to defend the rights of the individual: modern man has no more right to be a madman than medieval man had a right to be a heretic because if once people agree that they have identified the one true God, or Good, it brings about that they have to guard members and nonmembers of the group from the temptation to worship false gods or goods. A secularization of God and the medicalization of good resulted in the post-Enlightenment version of this view: once people agree that they have identified the one true reason, it brings about that they have to guard against the temptation to worship unreason—that is, madness.

Civil libertarians warn that the marriage of the State with psychiatry could have catastrophic consequences for civilization. In the same vein as the separation of church and state, Szasz believes that a solid wall must exist between psychiatry and the State.

=== &quot;Total institution&quot; ===
In his book &quot;Asylums&quot;, Erving Goffman coined the term &#x27;total institution&#x27; for mental hospitals and similar places which took over and confined a person&#x27;s whole life. Goffman placed psychiatric hospitals in the same category as concentration camps, prisons, military organizations, orphanages, and monasteries. In &quot;Asylums&quot; Goffman describes how the institutionalization process socializes people into the role of a good patient, someone &#x27;dull, harmless and inconspicuous&#x27;; it in turn reinforces notions of chronicity in severe mental illness.

== Law ==

In the US, critics of psychiatry contend that the intersection of the law and psychiatry create extra-legal entities. For example, the insanity defense, leading to detainment in a psychiatric institution versus a prison, can be worse than criminal imprisonment according to some critics, as it involves the risk of compulsory medication with neuroleptics or the use of electroshock treatment. While a criminal imprisonment has a predetermined and known time of duration, patients are typically committed to psychiatric hospitals for indefinite durations, an arguably outrageous imposition of fundamental uncertainty. It has been argued that such uncertainty risks aggravating mental instability, and that it substantially encourages a lapse into hopelessness and acceptance that precludes recovery.

=== Involuntary hospitalization ===

Critics see the use of legally sanctioned force in involuntary commitment as a violation of the fundamental principles of free or open societies. The political philosopher John Stuart Mill and others have argued that society has no right to use coercion to subdue an individual as long as they do not harm others. Research evidence regarding violent behavior by people with mental illness does not support a direct connection in most studies. The growing practice, in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, of Care in the Community was instituted partly in response to such concerns. Alternatives to involuntary hospitalization include the development of non-medical crisis care in the community.

The American Soteria project was developed by psychiatrist Loren Mosher as an alternative model of care in a residential setting to support those experiencing psychiatric symptoms or extreme states. The Soteria houses closed in 1983 in the United States due to lack of financial support. Similar programs were established in Europe, including in Sweden and other North European countries. More recently, a Soteria House opened in Vermont, US 

The physician Giorgio Antonucci, during his activity as a director of the &quot;Ospedale Psichiatrico Osservanza&quot; of Imola in Italy from 1979 to 1996, refused any form of coercion and any violation of the fundamental principles of freedom, questioning the basis of psychiatry itself.

== Psychiatry as pseudoscience and failed enterprise ==
Many of the above issues lead to the claim that psychiatry is a pseudoscience. According to some philosophers of science, for a theory to qualify as science it needs to exhibit the following characteristics:
* &quot;parsimony&quot;, as straightforward as the phenomena to be explained allow (see Occam&#x27;s razor);
* &quot;empirically testable and falsifiable&quot; (see Falsifiability);
* &quot;changeable&quot;, i.e. if necessary, changes may be made to the theory as new data are discovered;
* &quot;progressive&quot;, encompasses previous successful descriptions and explains and adds more;
* &quot;provisional&quot;, i.e. tentative; the theory does not attempt to assert that it is a final description or explanation.

Psychiatrists Colin A. Ross and Alvin Pam maintain that biopsychiatry does not qualify as a science on many counts.

Psychiatric researchers have been criticized on the basis of the replication crisis and textbook errors. Questionable research practices are known to bias key sources of evidence.
Stuart A. Kirk has argued that psychiatry is a failed enterprise, as mental illness has grown, not shrunk, with about 20% of American adults diagnosable as mentally ill in 2013.

According to a 2014 meta-analysis, psychiatric treatment is no less effective for psychiatric illnesses in terms of treatment effects than treatments by practitioners of other medical specialties for physical health conditions. The analysis found that the effect sizes for psychiatric interventions are, on average, on par with other fields of medicine.

== Diverse paths ==
Szasz has since (2008) re-emphasized his disdain for the term anti-psychiatry, arguing that its legacy has simply been a &quot;catchall term used to delegitimize and dismiss critics of psychiatric fraud and force by labeling them &quot;antipsychiatrists&quot;&quot;. He points out that the term originated in a meeting of four psychiatrists (Cooper, Laing, Berke and Redler) who never defined it yet &quot;counter-label[ed] their discipline as anti-psychiatry&quot;, and that he considers Laing most responsible for popularizing it despite also personally distancing himself. Szasz describes the deceased (1989) Laing in vitriolic terms, accusing him of being irresponsible and equivocal on psychiatric diagnosis and use of force, and detailing his past &quot;public behavior&quot; as &quot;a fit subject for moral judgment&quot; which he gives as &quot;a bad person and a fraud as a professional&quot;.

Daniel Burston, however, has argued that overall the published works of Szasz and Laing demonstrate far more points of convergence and intellectual kinship than Szasz admits, despite the divergence on a number of issues related to Szasz being a libertarian and Laing an existentialist; that Szasz employs a good deal of exaggeration and distortion in his criticism of Laing&#x27;s personal character, and unfairly uses Laing&#x27;s personal failings and family woes to discredit his work and ideas; and that Szasz&#x27;s &quot;clear-cut, crystalline ethical principles are designed to spare us the agonizing and often inconclusive reflections that many clinicians face frequently in the course of their work&quot;. Szasz has indicated that his own views came from libertarian politics held since his teens, rather than through experience in psychiatry; that in his &quot;rare&quot; contacts with involuntary mental patients in the past he either sought to discharge them (if they were not charged with a crime) or &quot;assisted the prosecution in securing [their] conviction&quot; (if they were charged with a crime and appeared to be prima facie guilty); that he is not opposed to consensual psychiatry and &quot;does not interfere with the practice of the conventional psychiatrist&quot;, and that he provided &quot;listening-and-talking (&quot;psychotherapy&quot;)&quot; for voluntary fee-paying clients from 1948 until 1996, a practice he characterizes as non-medical and not associated with his being a psychoanalytically trained psychiatrist.

The gay rights or gay liberation movement is often thought to have been part of anti-psychiatry in its efforts to challenge oppression and stigma and, specifically, to get homosexuality removed from the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. However, a psychiatric member of APA&#x27;s Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Issues Committee has recently sought to distance the two, arguing that they were separate in the early 70s protests at APA conventions and that APA&#x27;s decision to remove homosexuality was scientific and happened to coincide with the political pressure. Reviewers have responded, however, that the founders and movements were closely aligned; that they shared core texts, proponents and slogans; and that others have stated that, for example, the gay liberation critique was &quot;made possible by (and indeed often explicitly grounded in) traditions of antipsychiatry&quot;.

In the clinical setting, the two strands of anti-psychiatry—criticism of psychiatric knowledge and reform of its practices—were never entirely distinct. In addition, in a sense, anti-psychiatry was not so much a demand for the end of psychiatry, as it was an often self-directed demand for psychiatrists and allied professionals to question their own judgments, assumptions and practices. In some cases, the suspicion of non-psychiatric medical professionals towards the validity of psychiatry was described as anti-psychiatry, as well the criticism of &quot;hard-headed&quot; psychiatrists towards &quot;soft-headed&quot; psychiatrists. Most leading figures of anti-psychiatry were themselves psychiatrists, and equivocated over whether they were really &quot;against psychiatry&quot;, or parts thereof. Outside the field of psychiatry, however—e.g. for activists and non-medical mental health professionals such as social workers and psychologists—&#x27;anti-psychiatry&#x27; tended to mean something more radical. The ambiguous term &quot;anti-psychiatry&quot; came to be associated with these more radical trends, but there was debate over whether it was a new phenomenon, whom it best described, and whether it constituted a genuinely singular movement. In order to avoid any ambiguity intrinsic to the term anti-psychiatry, a current of thought that can be defined as critique of the basis of psychiatry, radical and unambiguous, aims for the complete elimination of psychiatry. The main representative of the critique of the basis of psychiatry is an Italian physician, Giorgio Antonucci, the founder of the non-psychiatric approach to psychological suffering, who posited that the &quot;essence of psychiatry lies in an ideology of discrimination&quot;.

In the 1990s, a tendency was noted among psychiatrists to characterize and to regard the anti-psychiatric movement as part of the past, and to view its ideological history as flirtation with the polemics of radical politics at the expense of scientific thought and enquiry. It was also argued, however, that the movement contributed towards generating demand for grassroots involvement in guidelines and advocacy groups, and to the shift from large mental institutions to community services. Additionally, community centers have tended in practice to distance themselves from the psychiatric/medical model and have continued to see themselves as representing a culture of resistance or opposition to psychiatry&#x27;s authority. Overall, while antipsychiatry as a movement may have become an anachronism by this period and was no longer led by eminent psychiatrists, it has been argued that it became incorporated into the mainstream practice of mental health disciplines. On the other hand, mainstream psychiatry became more biomedical, increasing the gap between professionals.

Henry Nasrallah claims that while he believes anti-psychiatry consists of many historical exaggerations based on events and primitive conditions from a century ago, &quot;antipsychiatry helps keep us honest and rigorous about what we do, motivating us to relentlessly seek better diagnostic models and treatment paradigms. Psychiatry is far more scientific today than it was a century ago, but misperceptions about psychiatry continue to be driven by abuses of the past. The best antidote for antipsychiatry allegations is a combination of personal integrity, scientific progress, and sound evidence-based clinical care&quot;.

A criticism was made in the 1990s that three decades of anti-psychiatry had produced a large literature critical of psychiatry, but little discussion of the deteriorating situation of the mentally troubled in American society. Anti-psychiatry crusades have thus been charged with failing to put suffering individuals first, and therefore being similarly guilty of what they blame psychiatrists for. The rise of anti-psychiatry in Italy was described by one observer as simply &quot;a transfer of psychiatric control from those with medical knowledge to those who possessed socio-political power&quot;.

Critics of this view, however, from an anti-psychiatry perspective, are quick to point to the industrial aspects of psychiatric treatment itself as a primary causal factor in this situation that is described as &quot;deteriorating&quot;. The numbers of people labeled &quot;mentally ill&quot;, and in treatment, together with the severity of their conditions, have been going up primarily due to the direct efforts of the mental health movement, and mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, and not their detractors. Envisioning &quot;mental health treatment&quot; as violence prevention has been a big part of the problem, especially as you are dealing with a population that is not significantly more violent than any other group and, in fact, are less so than many.

On October 7, 2016, the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) at the University of Toronto announced that they had established a scholarship for students doing theses in the area of antipsychiatry. Called &quot;The Bonnie Burstow Scholarship in Antipsychiatry&quot;, it is to be awarded annually to an OISE thesis student. An unprecedented step, the scholarship should further the cause of freedom of thought and the exchange of ideas in academia. The scholarship is named in honor of Bonnie Burstow, a faculty member at the University of Toronto, a radical feminist, and an antipsychiatry activist. She is also the author of &quot;Psychiatry and the Business of Madness&quot; (2015).

Some components of antipsychiatric theory have in recent decades been reformulated into a critique of &quot;corporate psychiatry&quot;, heavily influenced by the pharmaceutical industry. A recent editorial about this was published in the &quot;British Journal of Psychiatry&quot; by Moncrieff, arguing that modern psychiatry has become a handmaiden to conservative political commitments. David Healy is a psychiatrist and professor in psychological medicine at Cardiff University School of Medicine, Wales. He has a special interest in the influence of the pharmaceutical industry on medicine and academia.

In the meantime, members of the psychiatric consumer/survivor movement continued to campaign for reform, empowerment and alternatives, with an increasingly diverse representation of views. Groups often have been opposed and undermined, especially when they proclaim to be, or when they are labeled as being, &quot;anti-psychiatry&quot;. However, as of the 1990s, more than 60 percent of ex-patient groups reportedly support anti-psychiatry beliefs and consider themselves to be &quot;psychiatric survivors&quot;. Although anti-psychiatry is often attributed to a few famous figures in psychiatry or academia, it has been pointed out that consumer/survivor/ex-patient individuals and groups preceded it, drove it and carried on through it.

== Criticism ==
A schism exists among those critical of conventional psychiatry between radical abolitionists and more moderate reformists. Laing, Cooper and others associated with the initial anti-psychiatry movement stopped short of actually advocating for the abolition of coercive psychiatry. Thomas Szasz, from near the beginning of his career, crusaded for the abolition of forced psychiatry. Today, believing that coercive psychiatry marginalizes and oppresses people with its harmful, controlling, and abusive practices, many who identify as anti-psychiatry activists are proponents of the complete abolition of non-consensual and coercive psychiatry.

Critics of antipsychiatry from within psychiatry itself object to the underlying principle that psychiatry is by definition harmful. Most psychiatrists accept that issues exist that need addressing, but that the abolition of psychiatry is harmful. Nimesh Desai concludes: &quot;To be a believer and a practitioner of multidisciplinary mental health, it is not necessary to reject the medical model as one of the basics of psychiatry.&quot; and admits &quot;Some of the challenges and dangers to psychiatry are not so much from the avowed antipsychiatrists, but from the misplaced and misguided individuals and groups in related fields.&quot;

<text> is the Latin name under which the &quot;Lamb of God&quot; is honoured within Christian liturgies descending from the historic Latin liturgical tradition, including those of Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism and Anglicanism.

Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.&quot;)

(Last stanza repeats 3 times)

A Ukrainian translation was sung in 2015 in Lviv, Ukraine, during the War in Donbas at an event organized by Franklin Graham. The song was notably sung again on Easter 2022 in Lviv by a choir of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russo-Ukrainian War.

It was purchased by North American Philips in 1974, which was absorbed into Dutch electronics company Philips in 1991. The predecessor to Magnavox was founded in 1911 by Edwin Pridham and Peter L. Jensen, co-inventors of the moving-coil loudspeaker at their lab in Napa, California, under United States Patent number 1,105,924 for telephone receivers. Six decades later, Magnavox produced the Odyssey, the world&#x27;s first home video game console.

On January 29, 2013, it was announced that Philips had agreed to sell its audio and video operations to the Japan-based Funai Electric for €150 million, with the audio business planned to transfer to Funai in the latter half of 2013, and the video business in 2017. As part of the transaction, Funai was to pay a regular licensing fee to Philips for the use of the Philips brand. The purchase agreement was terminated by Philips in October because of breach of contract and the consumer electronics operations remain under Philips. Philips said it would seek damages for breach of contract in the US$200-million sale. In April 2016, the International Court of Arbitration ruled in favour of Philips, awarding compensation of €135 million in the process. Magnavox brand name products are currently made by Funai and Craig Electronics under license from trademark owner Philips.

January 2025, Curtis International Ltd. acquired the global rights to the Magnavox brand.

==History==

Jensen and Pridham founded the Commercial Wireless and Development Company in Napa, CA in 1911, moving to San Francisco, and then Oakland in 1916. In July 1917, a merger with The Sonora Phonograph Distributor Company was finalized and the Magnavox Company was born. Frank Morgan Steers was chosen as the company&#x27;s first President. Jensen moved on to found the Jensen Radio Manufacturing Company in Chicago, in the late 1920s. Pridham stayed on with Magnavox, which moved manufacturing to Fort Wayne, Indiana by the 1930s. The term &quot;Commercial Wireless&quot; had a different meaning in the early days of radio and telephone. Magnavox manufactured radios, TVs, and phonographs. In the 1960s, Magnavox manufactured the first plasma displays for the military and for computer applications.
In 1972 Magnavox introduced the Odyssey, the first video game console. In 1974, North American Philips acquired a majority stake in the Magnavox Company, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary the following year. Philips acquired the similar-sounding company Philco in 1981, and Philips was able to freely use the Philips name, alternating with the Magnavox name for some electronics, with the personal care business continuing to use the Norelco name.

In the late 1970s, Philips developed LaserDisc technology, producing an optically read, 12 inch disc that would contain recorded video material. In the early 1980s, Philips worked with Sony to create a standard for optical audio discs (CDs), using the technology developed for the LaserDisc.
Teamed with Sony, Philips used the Magnavox brand name to introduce the CD-DA standard and equipment for consumer audio with the Magnavox player sold in department stores while the Sony CDP-101 went to high-end audio stores.

During the late 1970s the company released the Odyssey², in Europe also known as Philips Videopac G7000.

In the early 1980s, Philips merged Sylvania, Philco and Magnavox into one division headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee, with a manufacturing plant in Greeneville, Tennessee. The Sylvania plant in Batavia, New York, was closed and all operations moved to Greeneville. Philips also abandoned the Sylvania trademark which is owned by Osram.

In the late 1980s, Magnavox sold the Magnavox/Philips VideoWriter with some success. Released in 1985, the VideoWriter was a standalone fixed-application word processing machine (electronic typewriter).

Philips Computers, primarily based in Canada, sold its products in North America under the Magnavox brand with minor rebadging in logo and color scheme of computers, monitors, peripherals and manuals. Philips exited the proprietary personal computer business in 1992. Philips sold the Greenville plant in 1997.

In the 1990s, several Magnavox branded CD-i players were marketed by Philips.

Starting in the early 1990s, some Philips electronics were marketed under the brand name &quot;Philips Magnavox&quot;, in an attempt to increase brand awareness of the Philips name in the United States. While it did work to a degree, it also caused confusion to the consumer as to the difference between &quot;Philips Magnavox&quot; products and &quot;Philips&quot; products, resulting in Philips marketing the two brands separately again.

The defense electronics group, centered in Fort Wayne, Indiana, remained independent under the Magnavox Electronic Systems name, first under Philips and later in the Carlyle Group, until it was acquired by Hughes Electronics in 1995. The three areas of business of the MESC operation during the late 1980s and early 1990s were C-Cubed (Command, Control, and Communication), Electronic Warfare, and sonobuoys. When Hughes Electronics sold its aerospace and defense operations to Raytheon, the former Magnavox defense operations were transferred as well. Shortly thereafter, Raytheon spun off the sonobuoy operation to form Under Sea Systems Inc (USSI), in Columbia City, Indiana. In 1998, Raytheon sold USSI to a British defense consortium named Ultra Electronics. The company is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Ultra, manufacturing water and acoustic sensing and communications devices for military and civil defense.

Among the defense products Magnavox manufactured were the AN/ARC-164 UHF radio, AN/SSQ-53 series sonobuoys, AN/ALQ-128 EW equipment, AN/SSQ-62 series sonobuoys, and the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS).

The brand also has worked with Funai with their televisions after the Philips Magnavox name was popular. Magnavox also has a brand licensing deal where several of their consumer electronics are manufactured by Craig Electronics and sold under the Magnavox brand.

In Australia, the rights to the Magnavox brand are not owned by Philips but by Mistral Ltd, a Hong Kong trading company that uses it to sell audio/video equipment of a different make.

In Europe, the brand Magnavox was briefly used in the 1990s by Philips on budget consumer electronics to replace traditional local brand names (such as Aristona, Erres, Hornyphon, Radiola, Siera). Since no one recognised the brand name, it was soon discontinued.

<text>Mikhail Afanasyevich Bulgakov ( ; ; – 10 March 1940) was a Russian writer, medical doctor, and playwright. His novel &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;, published posthumously, has been called one of the masterpieces of the 20th century.

He also wrote the novel &quot;The White Guard&quot; and the plays &quot;Ivan Vasilievich&quot;, &quot;Flight&quot; (also called &quot;The Run&quot;), and &quot;The Days of the Turbins&quot;. He wrote mostly about the horrors of the Russian Civil War and about the fate of Russian intellectuals and officers of the Tsarist Army caught up in revolution and Civil War.

Some of his works (&quot;Flight&quot;, all his works between the years 1922 and 1926, and others) were banned by the Soviet government, and personally by Joseph Stalin, after it was decided by them that they &quot;glorified emigration and White generals&quot;. On the other hand, Stalin loved &quot;The Days of the Turbins&quot; (also called &quot; The Turbin Brothers&quot;) very much and reportedly saw it at least 15 times.

==Life and work==
===Early life===

Mikhail Bulgakov was born on in Kiev, Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire, at 28 Vozdvishenskaya Street, into a Russian family, and baptized on . He was the oldest of the seven children of a state councilor, a professor at the Kiev Theological Academy, as well as a prominent Russian Orthodox essayist, thinker and translator of religious texts. His mother was Varvara Mikhailovna Bulgakova (&quot;nee&quot; Pokrovskaya), a former teacher at a women&#x27;s gymnasium. The academician Nikolai Petrov was his godfather, while his godmother was his paternal grandmother, Olympiada.

Afanasiy Bulgakov (1859 - 1907) was born in Oryol, Oryol Governorate, the oldest son of Ivan Abramovich Bulgakov, a priest, and his wife Olympiada Ferapontovna. He first studied in a seminary in Oryol, and then studied in Kiev Theological Academy from 1881 to 1885, and was named a docent of the Academy in 1886. Varvara Bulgakova (1869 - 1922) was born in Karachev; her father, Mikhail Pokrovsky, was a protoiereus. According to Edythe C. Haber, in his &quot;autobiographical remarks&quot; Bulgakov stated that she was a descendant of Tartar hordes, which supposedly influenced some of his works. Afanasiy and Varvara married in 1890. Their other children were Vera (b. 1892), Nadezhda (b. 1893), Varvara (b. 1895), Nikolai (b. 1898), Ivan (b. 1900), and Yelena (b. 1902). 

All the children received a good education; they read the classics of Russian and European literature, studied music, and went to concerts. Mikhail played piano, sang baritone, and enjoyed opera. In particular, he enjoyed &quot;Faust&quot; by Gounod; according to his sister Nadezhda, he attended showings of &quot;Faust&quot; at least 40 times. At home, Mikhail and his siblings acted out plays that they enjoyed; the family also had a dacha in Bucha.

In 1901, Bulgakov joined the First Kiev Gymnasium, where he developed an interest in Russian and European literature (his favourite authors at the time being Gogol, Pushkin, Dostoyevsky, Saltykov-Shchedrin, and Dickens), theatre and opera. The teachers of the Gymnasium exerted a great influence on the formation of his literary taste. After the death of his father in 1907, Mikhail&#x27;s mother, a well-educated and extraordinarily diligent person, assumed responsibility for his education. After graduation from the Gymnasium in 1909, Bulgakov entered the Medical Faculty of Kiev University.

In the summer of 1908, Bulgakov met Tatiana Lappa. Lappa, who lived in Saratov, had arrived in Kiev to visit her relatives; her aunt was a friend of Varvara Bulgakova and thus introduced her to the young Bulgakov. In 1909, Bulgakov began to study medicine at the Kiev University. In 1912, Lappa arrived in Kiev to study. The two married in April 1913.

Bulgakov was staying with Lappa&#x27;s parents in Saratov at the outbreak of the First World War. Her mother opened a field hospital for wounded soldiers, where Bulgakov worked as a doctor. The couple returned to Kiev in the autumn. In 1916, Bulgakov graduated from the university, after which he volunteered for the Red Cross. His wife volunteered as a nurse. He first worked in Kamianets-Podilskyi, then he was transferred to Chernivtsi in the same year. In September of that year he was transferred to Moscow; and then to the village of Nikolskoye in the Smolensk Oblast. The time he spent working as a doctor would be the inspiration for his short story cycle, &quot;A Young Doctor&#x27;s Notebook&quot; and his short story, &quot;Morphine&quot;. &quot;Morphine&quot; is based on the author&#x27;s actual addiction to morphine, which he started taking to alleviate the allergic effects of an anti-diphtheria drug, after accidentally infecting himself with the disease while treating a child with the same condition. While visiting Kiev with his wife, they received advice from Bulgakov&#x27;s stepfather on countering his addiction in the form of injecting distilled water instead of morphine, which gradually helped Bulgakov to end his addiction.

In the autumn of 1917 he was transferred to the town of Vyazma, but left for Moscow in either November or December of that year in an unsuccessful attempt to gain a military discharge. After briefly visiting Lappa&#x27;s parents in Saratov, they returned to Kiev in February 1918. Upon returning Bulgakov opened a private practice at his home at Andreyevsky Descent, 13. Here he lived through the Civil War and witnessed ten coups. Successive governments drafted the young doctor into their service while two of his brothers were serving in the White Army against the Bolsheviks.

In 1919, he was mobilised as an army physician by the White Army. In September 1919, Bulgakov was in Grozny with his wife. While there, he observed the fighting between the forces of Anton Denikin and Uzun-Hajji in the city of Chechen-Aul; this became part of one of his earliest works, &quot;Unusual Adventures&quot; (). There, he became seriously ill with typhus and barely survived. In the Caucasus, he started working as a journalist, but when he and others were invited to return as doctors by the French and German governments, Bulgakov was refused permission to leave Russia because of the typhus. That was when he last saw his family; after the Civil War and the rise of the Soviets most of his relatives emigrated to Paris.

===Career===
Bulgakov had expressed his desire to be a writer as early as 1912 or 1913, when he showed his sister Nadezhda his first attempt at a story, called &quot;The Fiery Serpent&quot; (), about an alcoholic who dies in a fit of delirium tremens, and stated to her that he planned to be a writer. According to his first wife, he first began to consistently write in Vyazma, where at nights he would work on a story called &quot;The Green Serpent&quot; ().

After his illness, Bulgakov abandoned his medical practice to pursue writing. Bulgakov in his autobiography wrote that he abandoned medicine for writing in early 1920; according to his friend , Bulgakov abandoned medicine for good on 15 February 1920. At this time, he was in Vladikavkaz. His first book was an almanac of feuilletons called &quot;Future Perspectives&quot;, written and published the same year. He wrote and saw his first two plays, &quot;Self Defence&quot; and &quot;The Turbin Brothers&quot;, being produced for the city theater stage with great success.

After travelling through the Caucasus, Bulgakov headed for Moscow, intending &quot;to remain here forever&quot;. It was difficult to find work in the capital, but he was appointed secretary to the literary section of Glavpolitprosvet (Central Committee of the Republic for Political Education). In September 1921, Bulgakov and his wife settled near Patriarch&#x27;s Ponds, on Bolshaya Sadovaya street, 10. To make a living, he started working as a correspondent and feuilletons writer for the newspapers &quot;Gudok&quot;, &quot;Krasnaia Panorama&quot; and &quot;Nakanune&quot;, based in Berlin. For the almanac &quot;Nedra&quot;, he wrote &quot;Diaboliad&quot;, &quot;The Fatal Eggs&quot; (1924), and &quot;Heart of a Dog&quot; (1925), works that combined bitter satire and elements of science fiction and were concerned with the fate of a scientist and the misuse of his discovery.

Between 1922 and 1926, Bulgakov wrote several plays (including &quot;Zoyka&#x27;s Apartment&quot;), none of which were allowed production at the time. &quot;The Run&quot;, treating the horrors of a fratricidal war, was personally banned by Joseph Stalin after the Glavrepertkom (Department of Repertoire) decided that it &quot;glorified emigration and White generals&quot;. In the spring of 1924, Bulgakov divorced Tatyana Lappa. The next year, he married Lyubov Belozerskaya.

When one of Moscow&#x27;s theatre directors severely criticised Bulgakov, Stalin personally protected him, saying that a writer of Bulgakov&#x27;s quality was above &quot;party words&quot; like &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;. Stalin found work for the playwright at a small Moscow theatre, and next the Moscow Art Theatre (MAT). Bulgakov&#x27;s first major work was the novel &quot;The White Guard&quot; (Belaya gvardiya [Белая гвардия]), serialized in 1925 but never published in book form. 
On 5 October 1926, &quot;The Days of the Turbins&quot;, the play which continued the theme of &quot;The White Guard&quot; (the fate of Russian intellectuals and officers of the Tsarist Army caught up in revolution and Civil war) was premiered at the MAT. Stalin liked it very much and reportedly saw it at least 15 times.

His plays &quot;Ivan Vasilievich&quot; (Иван Васильевич), &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (Дон Кихот) and &quot;Last Days&quot; (Последние дни [Poslednie Dni], also called &quot;Pushkin&quot;) were banned. The premier of another, &quot;Moliėre&quot; (also known as &quot;The Cabal of Hypocrites&quot;), about the French dramatist in which Bulgakov plunged &quot;into fairy Paris of the XVII century&quot;, received bad reviews in &quot;Pravda&quot; and the play was withdrawn from the theater repertoire. In 1928, &quot;Zoyka&#x27;s Apartment&quot; and &quot;The Purple Island&quot; were staged in Moscow; both comedies were accepted by the public with great enthusiasm, but critics again gave them bad reviews. By March 1929, Bulgakov&#x27;s career was ruined when Government censorship stopped the publication of any of his work and his plays.

In despair, Bulgakov first wrote a personal letter to Joseph Stalin (July 1929), then on 28 March 1930, a letter to the Soviet government. He requested permission to emigrate if the Soviet Union could not find use for him as a writer. In his autobiography, Bulgakov claimed to have written to Stalin out of desperation and mental anguish, never intending to post the letter. He received a phone call directly from the Soviet leader, who asked the writer whether he really desired to leave the Soviet Union. Bulgakov replied that a Russian writer cannot live outside of his homeland. Stalin gave him permission to continue working at the Art Theater; on 10 May 1930, he re-joined the theater, as stage director&#x27;s assistant. Later he adapted Gogol&#x27;s &quot;Dead Souls&quot; for stage.

In 1932, Bulgakov married for the third time, to Yelena Shilovskaya, who would prove to be inspiration for the character Margarita in &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;, which he started working on in 1928. During the last decade of his life, Bulgakov continued to work on &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;, wrote plays, critical works, and stories and made several translations and dramatisations of novels. Many of them were not published, others were &quot;torn to pieces&quot; by critics. Much of his work (ridiculing the Soviet system) stayed in his desk drawer for several decades. The refusal of the authorities to let him work in the theatre and his desire to see his family who were living abroad, whom he had not seen for many years, led him to seek drastic measures. Despite his new work, the projects he worked on at the theatre were often prohibited, and he was stressed and unhappy.

===Last years===
In the late 1930s, he joined the Bolshoi Theatre as a librettist and consultant. He left after perceiving that none of his works would be produced there. Stalin&#x27;s favor protected Bulgakov from arrests and execution, but he could not get his writing published. His novels and dramas were subsequently banned and, for the second time, Bulgakov&#x27;s career as playwright was ruined. When his last play &quot;Batum&quot; (1939), a complimentary portrayal of Stalin&#x27;s early revolutionary days, was banned before rehearsals, Bulgakov requested permission to leave the country but was refused.

In poor health, Bulgakov devoted his last years to what he called his &quot;sunset&quot; novel. The years 1937 to 1939 were stressful for Bulgakov, veering from glimpses of optimism, believing the publication of his masterpiece could still be possible, to bouts of depression, when he felt as if there were no hope. On 15 June 1938, when the manuscript was nearly finished, Bulgakov wrote in a letter to his wife:
&quot;In front of me 327 pages of the manuscript (about 22 chapters). The most important remains – editing, and it&#x27;s going to be hard, I will have to pay close attention to details. Maybe even re-write some things... &#x27;What&#x27;s its future?&#x27; you ask? I don&#x27;t know. Possibly, you will store the manuscript in one of the drawers, next to my &#x27;killed&#x27; plays, and occasionally it will be in your thoughts. Then again, you don&#x27;t know the future. My own judgement of the book is already made and I think it truly deserves being hidden away in the darkness of some chest...&quot;

In 1939, Bulgakov organized a private reading of &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; to his close circle of friends. Elena Bulgakova remembered 30 years later, &quot;When he finally finished reading that night, he said: &#x27;Well, tomorrow I am taking the novel to the publisher!&#x27; and everyone was silent&quot;, &quot;...Everyone sat paralyzed. Everything scared them. P. (P. A. Markov, in charge of the literature division of MAT) later at the door fearfully tried to explain to me that trying to publish the novel would cause terrible things&quot;, she wrote in her diary (14 May 1939).

In the last month of his life, friends and relatives were constantly on duty at his bedside. On 10 March 1940, Bulgakov died from nephrotic syndrome (an inherited kidney disorder). His father had died of the same disease, and from his youth Bulgakov had guessed his future mortal diagnosis. On 11 March, a civil funeral was held in the building of the Union of Soviet Writers. Before the funeral, the Moscow sculptor Sergey Merkurov cast a death mask of his face. He was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

==Works==

During his life, Bulgakov was best known for the plays he contributed to Konstantin Stanislavski&#x27;s and Nemirovich-Danchenko&#x27;s Moscow Art Theatre. Stalin was known to be fond of the play &quot;Days of the Turbins&quot; (Дни Турбиных, 1926), which was based on Bulgakov&#x27;s novel &quot;The White Guard&quot;. His dramatization of Molière&#x27;s life in &quot;The Cabal of Hypocrites&quot; (Кабала святош, 1936) is still performed by the Moscow Art Theatre. Even after his plays were banned from the theatres, Bulgakov wrote a comedy about Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s visit into 1930s Moscow. His play &quot;Batum&quot; (Батум, 1939) about the early years of Stalin was prohibited by the premier himself. Bulgakov later reflected his experience of being a Soviet playwright in &quot;Theatrical Novel&quot; (Театральный роман, 1936, unfinished). 

His prose remained unprinted from the late 1920s to 1961; from 1941 to 1954 the only Bulgakov plays that were staged were &quot;The Last Days&quot; and his adaptation of Gogol&#x27;s Dead Souls. In 1962, his &quot;Life of Monsieur de Molière&quot; was published; in 1963, &quot;Notes of a Young Doctor&quot;; in 1965, &quot;Theatrical Novel&quot; and a collection of his plays were published; in 1966, a collection of his prose including &quot;The White Guard&quot;; and in 1967 &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; was published.

Bulgakov began writing novels with &quot;The White Guard&quot; (Белая гвардия) (1923, partly published in 1925, first full edition 1927–1929, Paris) – a novel about a life of a White Army officer&#x27;s family in civil war Kiev. In the mid-1920s, he came to admire the works of Alexander Belyaev and H. G. Wells and wrote several stories and novellas with elements of science fiction, notably &quot;The Fatal Eggs&quot; (Роковые яйца) (1924) and &quot;Heart of a Dog&quot; (Собачье сердце) (1925). He intended to compile his stories of the mid-twenties (published mostly in medical journals) that were based on his work as a country doctor in 1916–1918 into a collection titled &quot;Notes of a Young Doctor&quot; (Записки юного врача), but the book came out only in 1963.

&quot;The Fatal Eggs&quot; tells of the events of a Professor Persikov, who, in experimentation with eggs, discovers a red ray that accelerates growth in living organisms. At the time, an illness passes through the chickens of Moscow, killing most of them, and to remedy the situation, the Soviet government puts the ray into use at a farm. Due to a mix-up in egg shipments, the Professor ends up with chicken eggs, while the government-run farm receives the shipment of ostrich, snake and crocodile eggs ordered by the Professor. The mistake is not discovered until the eggs produce giant monstrosities that wreak havoc in the suburbs of Moscow and kill most of the workers on the farm. The propaganda machine turns on Persikov, distorting his nature in the same way his &quot;innocent&quot; tampering created the monsters. This tale of a bungling government earned Bulgakov his label of counter-revolutionary.

&quot;Heart of a Dog&quot; features a professor who implants human testicles and a pituitary gland into a dog named Sharik (means &quot;Little Balloon&quot; or &quot;Little Ball&quot; – a popular Russian nickname for a male dog). The dog becomes more and more human as time passes, resulting in all manner of chaos. The tale can be read as a critical satire of liberal nihilism and the communist mentality. It contains a few bold hints to the communist leadership; e.g. the name of the drunkard donor of the human organ implants is Chugunkin which can be seen as a parody on the name of Stalin (&quot;stal&#x27;&quot; is steel). It was adapted as a comic opera called &quot;The Murder of Comrade Sharik&quot; by William Bergsma in 1973. In 1988, an award-winning film version &quot;Sobachye Serdtse&quot; was produced by Lenfilm, starring Yevgeniy Yevstigneyev, Roman Kartsev and Vladimir Tolokonnikov.

== &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; ==

The novel &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; is a critique of Soviet society and its literary establishment. The work is appreciated for its philosophical undertones and for its high artistic level, thanks to its picturesque descriptions (especially of old Jerusalem), lyrical fragments and style. It is a frame narrative involving two characteristically related time periods, or plot lines: a retelling in Bulgakov&#x27;s interpretation of the New Testament and a description of contemporary Moscow.

The novel begins with Satan visiting Moscow in the 1930s, joining a conversation between a critic and a poet debating the most effective method of denying the existence of Jesus Christ. It develops into an all-embracing indictment of the corruption of communism and Soviet Russia. A story within the story portrays the interrogation of Jesus Christ by Pontius Pilate and the Crucifixion.

It became the best known novel by Bulgakov. He began writing it in 1928, but the novel was finally published by his widow only in 1966, twenty-six years after his death. The book contributed a number of sayings to the Russian language, for example, &quot;Manuscripts don&#x27;t burn&quot; and &quot;second-grade freshness&quot;. A destroyed manuscript of the Master is an important element of the plot. Bulgakov had to rewrite the novel from memory after he burned the draft manuscript in 1930, as he could not see a future as a writer in the Soviet Union at a time of widespread political repression.

==Legacy==
===Exhibitions and museums===
*Several displays at the One Street Museum are dedicated to Bulgakov&#x27;s family. Among the items presented in the museum are original photos of Mikhail Bulgakov, books and his personal belongings, and a window frame from the house where he lived. The museum also keeps scientific works of Prof. Afanasiy Bulgakov, Mikhail&#x27;s father.

====Mikhail Bulgakov Museum, Kyiv====
The Mikhail Bulgakov Museum (Bulgakov House) in Kyiv has been converted to a literary museum with some rooms devoted to the writer, as well as some to his works. This was his family home, the model for the house of the Turbin family in his play &quot;The Days of the Turbins&quot;.

====The Bulgakov Museums in Moscow====
In Moscow, two museums honour the memory of Mikhail Bulgakov and &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;. Both are situated in Bulgakov&#x27;s old apartment building on Bolshaya Sadovaya street nr. 10, in which parts of &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; are set. Since the 1980s, the building has become a gathering spot for Bulgakov&#x27;s fans, as well as Moscow-based Satanist groups, and had various kinds of graffiti scrawled on the walls. The numerous paintings, quips, and drawings were completely whitewashed in 2003. Previously the best drawings were kept as the walls were repainted, so that several layers of different colored paints could be seen around the best drawings.

=====The Bulgakov House=====
The Bulgakov House (Russian: Музей – театр &quot;Булгаковский Дом&quot;) is situated at the ground floor. This museum has been established as a private initiative on 15 May 2004.

The &quot;Bulgakov House&quot; contains personal belongings, photos, and several exhibitions related to Bulgakov&#x27;s life and his different works. Various poetic and literary events are often held, and excursions to &quot;Bulgakov&#x27;s Moscow&quot; are organised, some of which are animated with living characters of &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;. The &quot;Bulgakov House&quot; also runs the &quot;Theatre M.A. Bulgakov&quot; with 126 seats, and the &quot;Café 302-bis&quot;.

=====The Museum M.A. Bulgakov=====
In the same building, in apartment number 50 on the fourth floor, is a second museum that keeps alive the memory of Bulgakov, the Museum M.A. Bulgakov (Russian: Музей М. А. Булгаков). This second museum is a government initiative, and was founded on 26 March 2007.

The Museum M.A. Bulgakov contains personal belongings, photos, and several exhibitions related to Bulgakov&#x27;s life and his different works. Various poetic and literary events are often held.

===Other places named after him===
*A minor planet, 3469 Bulgakov, discovered by the Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Georgievna Karachkina in 1982, is named after him.

===Works inspired by him ===
====Literature====
*Salman Rushdie said that &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; was an inspiration for his novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; (1988).
*John Hodge&#x27;s play &quot;Collaborators&quot; (2011) is a fictionalized account of the relationship between Bulgakov and Joseph Stalin, inspired by &quot;The Days of the Turbins&quot; and &quot;The White Guard.&quot;

====Music====
*According to Mick Jagger, &quot;Master and Margarita&quot; was part of the inspiration for The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; (1968). 
*The lyrics of Pearl Jam&#x27;s song &quot;Pilate&quot;, featured on their album &quot;Yield&quot; (1998), were inspired by &quot;Master and Margarita&quot;. The lyrics were written by the band&#x27;s bassist Jeff Ament.
*Alex Kapranos from Franz Ferdinand-based &quot;Love and Destroy&quot; on the same book.

====Film====
*&quot;The Flight&quot; (1970) — a two-part historical drama based on Bulgakov&#x27;s &quot;Flight&quot;, &quot;The White Guard&quot; and &quot;Black Sea&quot;. It was the first Soviet adaptation of Bulgakov&#x27;s writings directed by Aleksandr Alov and Vladimir Naumov, with Bulgakov&#x27;s third wife Elena Bulgakova credited as a &quot;literary consultant&quot;. The film was officially selected for the 1971 Cannes Film Festival.
*&quot;The Master and Margaret&quot; (1972) — a joint Yugoslav-Italian drama directed by Aleksandar Petrović, the first adaptation of the novel of the same name, along with &quot;Pilate and Others&quot;. It was selected as the Yugoslav entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 45th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.
*&quot;Pilate and Others&quot; (1972) — a German TV drama directed by Andrzej Wajda, it was also a loose adaptation of &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; novel. The film focused on the biblical part of the story, and the action was moved to the modern-day Frankfurt.
*&quot;Ivan Vasilievich: Back to the Future&quot; (1973) — an adaptation of Bulgakov&#x27;s science fiction/comedy play &quot;Ivan Vasilievich&quot; about an unexpected visit of Ivan the Terrible to the modern-day Moscow. It was directed by one of the leading Soviet comedy directors Leonid Gaidai. With 60.7 million viewers on the year of release it became the 17th most popular film ever produced in the USSR.
*&quot;Dog&#x27;s Heart&quot; (1976) — a joint Italian-German science fiction/comedy film directed by Alberto Lattuada. It was the first adaptation of the &quot;Heart of a Dog&quot; satirical novel about an old scientist who tries to grow a man out of a dog.
*&quot;The Days of the Turbins&quot; (1976) — a three-part Soviet TV drama directed by Vladimir Basov. It was an adaptation of the play of the same name which, at the same time, was Bulgakov&#x27;s stage adaptation of &quot;The White Guard&quot; novel.
*&quot;Heart of a Dog&quot; (1988) — a Soviet black-and-white TV film directed by Vladimir Bortko, the second adaptation of the novel of the same name. Unlike the previous version, this film follows the original text closely, while also introducing characters, themes and dialogues featured in other Bulgakov&#x27;s writings.
*&quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; (1989) — a Polish TV drama in four parts directed by Maciej Wojtyszko. It was noted by critics as a very faithful adaptation of the original novel.
*&quot;After the Revolution&quot; (1990) – a feature-length film created by András Szirtes, a Hungarian filmmaker, using a simple video camera, from 1987 to 1989. It is a very loose adaptation, but for all that, it is explicitly based on Bulgakov&#x27;s novel, in a thoroughly experimental way. What you see in this film is documentary-like scenes shot in Moscow and Budapest, and New York, and these scenes are linked to the novel by some explicit links, and by these, the film goes beyond the level of being but a visual documentary which would only have reminded the viewer of The Master and Margarita.
*&quot;Incident in Judaea&quot;, a 1991 film by Paul Bryers for Channel 4, focussing on the biblical parts of The Master and Margarita.
*&quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; (1994) — Russian film directed by Yuri Kara in 1994 and released to public only in 2011. Known for a long, troubled post-production due to the director&#x27;s resistance to cut about 80 minutes of the film on the producers&#x27; request, as well as copyright claims from the descendants of Elena Bulgakova (Shilovskaya).
*&quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; (2005) — Russian TV mini-series directed by Vladimir Bortko and his second adaptation of Bulgakov&#x27;s writings. Screened for Russia-1, it was seen by 40 million viewers on its initial release, becoming the most popular Russian TV series.
*&quot;Morphine&quot; (2008) — Russian film directed by Aleksei Balabanov loosely based on Bulgakov&#x27;s autobiographical short stories &quot;Morphine&quot; and &quot;A Country Doctor&#x27;s Notebook&quot;. The screenplay was written by Balabanov&#x27;s friend and regular collaborator Sergei Bodrov, Jr. before his tragic death in 2002.
*&quot;The White Guard&quot; (2012) — Russian TV mini-series produced by Russia-1. The film was shot in Saint Petersburg and Kyiv and released to mostly negative reviews. In 2014 the Ukrainian Ministry of Culture banned the distribution of the film, claiming that it shows &quot;contempt for the Ukrainian language, people and state&quot;.
*&quot;A Young Doctor&#x27;s Notebook&quot; (2012–2013) — British mini-series produced by BBC, with Jon Hamm and Daniel Radcliffe playing main parts. Unlike the Morphine film by Aleksei Balabanov that mixed drama and thriller, this version of &quot;A Country Doctor&#x27;s Notebook&quot; was made as a black comedy.
* &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;. (2024) − Film directed by Michael Lockshin.

==Medical eponym==
After graduating from the Medical School in 1909, he spent the early days of his career as a venereologist, rather than pursuing his goal of being a pediatrician, as syphilis was highly prevalent during those times. It was during those early years that he described the symptoms and characteristics of syphilis affecting the bones. He described the abnormal and concomitant change of the outline of the crests of the shin-bones with a pathological worm-eaten like appearance and creation of abnormal osteophytes in the bones of those suffering from later stages of syphilis. This became known as &quot;Bulgakov&#x27;s Sign&quot; and is commonly used in the former Soviet states, but is known as the &quot;Bandy Legs Sign&quot; in the west.

<text>Microware Systems Corporation was an American software company based in Clive, Iowa, that produced the OS-9 real-time operating system.

Microware Systems Corporation existed as a separate entity from 1977 until September 2001, when it was bought by RadiSys Corp., and became a division of that company. The rights to Microware OS-9 and related software were purchased by a group of distributors on 1 March 2013. The new owner was Microware LP. Microware initially produced a version of BASIC and a real-time kernel for the Motorola 6800 processor, and was asked by Motorola to develop what turned into BASIC09 for the then-new Motorola 6809 processor. Having written BASIC09, they decided it needed an operating system underlying it, and they created the first version of OS-9.

OS-9 was ported to the 68000 family of processors and, after being rewritten mostly in C, to the Intel 80x86, PowerPC, ARM, MIPS, and some of the Hitachi SuperH (SH) series processors. Initially, in the days of the SS-50 bus and SS-50C bus systems such as SWTPC, Gimix, and Smoke Signal Broadcasting, OS-9 was used more as a general purpose microcomputer operating system and had a large, active hobbyist-user population. OS-9 was also popular with industrial and embedded-system users. This was especially true when OS-9 was available for popular 6809-based computers such as the FM-7, FM-77, and the Tandy TRS-80 Color Computer and its near-clone, the Dragon. Over time, Microware concentrated on industrial customers and neglected the hobbyist base that was porting a great many Unix packages and utilities to OS-9.

== Microware products ==
* RT68 – the original product for the 6800
* OS-9 and OS-9000 – real-time operating systems for a wide range of embedded CPU architectures.
* CD-RTOS – the operating system used in the Philips CD-i players, which was a special version of OS-9/68K v2.4.
* DAVID – the Digital Audio Video Interactive Decoder platform for digital TV.
* Ariel – a micro OS based on an OS Microware acquired (MTOS-UX by IPI).
* Color Computer 3 BASIC ROM extensions to support 80-column text and new graphics modes not in the CoCo 1 and 2&#x27;s Extended Color BASIC ROM
