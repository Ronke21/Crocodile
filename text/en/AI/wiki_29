<text>Szczerbiec () is the ceremonial sword used in the coronations of most Polish monarchs from 1320 to 1764. It now is displayed in the treasure vault of the royal Wawel Castle in Kraków, as the only preserved part of the medieval Polish crown jewels. The sword is noted for its hilt, decorated with magical formulae, Christian symbols, and floral patterns, as well as for the narrow slit in the blade which holds a small shield with the coat of arms of Poland. The name of the sword is derived from the Polish word &quot;&quot; (&quot;gap&quot;, &quot;notch&quot;, or &quot;chip&quot;), and its meaning is incorrectly perceived as &quot;the Notched Sword&quot; or &quot;the Jagged Sword&quot; (which is included in the sword&#x27;s legend), though the edges of its blade are straight and smooth. Proper meaning and rendering into English would be &quot;the Notching/Jagging Sword&quot; — as &quot;a sword that is meant to notch/jag other weapons&quot;.

The legend links Szczerbiec with King Boleslaus I the Brave who was said to have chipped the sword by hitting it against the Golden Gate of Kiev during his intervention in the Kievan succession crisis in 1018. However, the Golden Gate was only constructed in 1037 and the sword is actually dated to the late 12th or 13th century. It was first used as a coronation sword by Ladislaus the Short in 1320. Looted by Prussian troops in 1795, it changed hands several times during the 19th century until it was purchased in 1884 for the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. The Soviet Union returned it to Poland in 1928 as part of war reparations for their loss against Poland in the Polish-Soviet war. During the Second World War, Szczerbiec was evacuated to Canada and did not return to Kraków until 1959. In the 20th century, an image of the sword was adopted as a symbol by Polish nationalist and far-right movements.

== Description ==
Szczerbiec is a ceremonial sword bearing rich Gothic ornamentation, dated to the mid-13th century. It is classified as a type XII sword with a type pommel and a type 6 crossguard according to the Oakeshott typology, although the blade may have changed its shape due to centuries of corrosion and intensive cleaning before every coronation.

=== Hilt ===
The hilt consists of a round pommel, a flat grip and an arched crossguard. The grip is long, thick, and from wide. It is rectangular in cross-section and its hard edges make it difficult to handle and impractical for fighting, which is indicative of the sword&#x27;s purely ceremonial usage. The pommel is in diameter and thick, with a chamfered outer ring that is wide. The crossguard forms an arch that is wide in the middle and widens up to at both ends. It is thick near the grip and measures in length along its upper edge.

The pommel and the crossguard are made of silver. The core of the grip is a brass chest encasing the tang of the blade. It was probably made in the 19th century to replace an original organic core, which had decomposed. At the same time the tang was riveted to the top of the pommel. The head of the rivet, which is in diameter, rests atop a rectangular washer measuring .

All parts of the hilt are covered with golden plates, which are engraved with sharp or rounded styli and decorated with niello, or black metallic inlay that contrasts against the golden background. Each plate is thick and made of about 18-carat gold. The niello designs include inscriptions written in late Romanesque majuscule (with some uncial additions), Christian symbols, and floral patterns. The floral ornaments are in negative, that is, golden against a black, nielloed background.

On the obverse side of the hilt, the pommel bears a large stylized letter T on top of a letter C or G (the latter could be just a decorative element of the letter T) between the Greek letters Α and ω (alpha and omega) surmounted with little crosses. Below the letter T, there is another cross placed within a cloud or flower with twelve petals. On the chamfered edge around this design runs a circular Latin inscription in two rings which reads: &quot;Rec figura talet ad amorem regum / et principum iras iudicum&quot; (&quot;This sign rouses the love of kings and princes, the wrath of judges&quot;). The grip bears the symbols of two of the Four Evangelists: the lion of Saint Mark and the ox of Saint Luke, as well as an &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; (Lamb of God). The crossguard bears the following Latin inscription: &quot;Quicumque hec / nomina Deii secum tu/lerit nullum periculum / ei omnino nocebit&quot; (&quot;Whoever will carry these names of God with him, no danger will harm him&quot;).

The reverse side of the pommel is decorated with a vine bush surrounded by a wreath of vine leaves. On the reverse of the grip, there are the eagle of Saint John and the angel of Saint Matthew, and another &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;. The crossguard bears, above another pattern of vine leaves, an inscription in corrupted Hebrew in Latin script: &quot;Con citomon Eeve Sedalai Ebrebel&quot; (&quot;Fervent faith incite the names of God: Sedalai and Ebrehel&quot;). On the opposite ends of the crossguard, there are again the symbols of Saints John and Matthew.

The circumference of the pommel is decorated with a rhombic pattern, while the upper side of the crossguard – with a similar triangular pattern. The narrow sides of the grip used to be embellished with inscribed silver plates, which, however, were lost in the 19th century. These lost inscriptions are partly known from graphical documentation made by King Stanislaus Augustus&#x27;s court painter, Johann Christoph Werner, in 1764 and by Jacek Przybylski in 1792. One of the plates had already been broken by that time with only part of the inscription preserved: &quot;Liste est glaud... h Bolezlai Duc...&quot; (&quot;This is a sword of... Duke Boleslaus...&quot;); the inscription on the other plate continued: &quot;Cum quo ei D[omi]n[us] SOS &quot;[&quot;Salvator Omnipotens Salvator&quot;]&quot; auxiletur ad[ver]sus partes amen&quot; (&quot;With whom is the Omnipotent Lord and Savior, to help him against his enemies. Amen&quot;). The missing part of the first inscription is only known from an old replica of Szczerbiec which once belonged to the Radziwiłł family &quot;(see Historical replicas below)&quot;. The full inscription read: &quot;Iste est gladius Principis et haeredis Boleslai Ducis Poloniae et Masoviae, Lanciciae&quot; (&quot;This is a sword of Hereditary Prince Boleslaus, Duke of Poland, Masovia, and Łęczyca&quot;). The identity of this Duke Boleslaus is uncertain.


Use-wear analysis indicates that the plates on the pommel and the crossguard were made by the same artist, while the plates on the grip were added later. The latter – obverse and reverse – were probably decorated in the same workshop and using the same tools, but by two different craftsmen. Moreover, a side plate with a rhombic pattern was added in the 19th century to replace one of the lost inscribed side plates.

Preserved images of Szczerbiec from various points in time indicate that the decorative plates were several times dismounted and placed again on the hilt in variable configurations. The current composition, with the symbols of the Evangelists duplicated on each side of the hilt, matches that known from the earliest preserved depiction drafted by Johann Christoph Werner in 1794. It is possible, though, that the original placement of the golden plates was different, with the symbols of Saints John and Matthew on the obverse of the grip, so that each side of the hilt displayed the symbols of all four of the Evangelists.

=== Blade ===
The blade is long, up to wide (about 5 cm from the crossguard) and thick. The fuller is about long and, on average, wide. Metallographic analysis has shown that the blade was forged from unevenly carburized semi-hard bloomery steel. Apart from iron, the material contains, by weight, 0.6 percent of carbon, 0.153 percent of silicon, 0.092 percent of phosphorus, and other elements. Numerous slag inclusions found in the steel are typical for medieval iron smelting technology. Part of the blade was hardened by quenching. Unlike the hilt, the blade would have been fully functional as a weapon of war. The surface of the blade is covered with deep scratches along its length, a result of intensive cleaning from rust before every coronation, probably with sand or brick powder. Inactive spots of corrosion may be also found on the entire surface.

Just below the hilt, there are three perforations in the fuller of the blade. The largest is a rectangular slot that is long and wide. This opening, known in Polish as &quot;szczyrba&quot; or &quot;szczerba&quot;, was originally caused by rust and, in the 19th century, polished into a regular shape. A small heraldic shield colored with oil paint is fastened to the slot. It is roughly triangular in shape, with the sides measuring from . The shield, bearing the White Eagle of Poland, was originally attached to the scabbard, or sheath. The Gothic scabbard, with a golden or silver locket and chape, was probably created in 1320 and lost between 1819 and 1874. The shield is the only preserved element of the sheath. It was tilted to the left – from the onlooker&#x27;s point of view – while it was fastened to the scabbard&#x27;s locket, but today it is aligned with the blade. The eagle on the red field of the shield is white, with a golden crown, bands across the wings, ring on the tail, and talons. The two other perforations are round holes, apart. The upper one, just below the slot, is in diameter, while the other measures only . They were probably punched in the 19th century to fasten the heraldic shield to the blade.

== Location ==
Szczerbiec is owned by the Wawel Royal Castle National Art Collection (inventory number 137) in Kraków, the former capital city of Poland. As the only preserved of Polish medieval coronation insignia, it is a prominent part of the museum&#x27;s Treasury and Armory permanent exhibition. The sword is suspended horizontally inside a glass case in the middle of the Jagiełło and Hedwig Vault located on the ground floor in the northeastern corner of the Wawel Castle.

== History ==
=== The Szczerbiec of Boleslaus the Brave ===
Historical accounts related to the early history of the Polish coronation sword are scant and often mixed with legend. The earliest known use of the name &quot;Szczerbiec&quot; appeared in the &quot;Chronicle of Greater Poland&quot; at the turn of the 14th century. According to this source, the sword was given to King Boleslaus the Brave (reigned 992–1025) by an angel; Polish kings were supposed to always carry it in battle to triumph over their enemies. During Boleslaus&#x27;s invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27;, he hit it against the Golden Gate of Kyiv while capturing the city. It was the notch that appeared on the edge of the blade which gave the sword its name. This account, written three centuries after the events it describes, is implausible not only because of the customary reference to the sword&#x27;s supernatural origin (compare Excalibur), but also because Boleslaus&#x27;s intervention in the Kievan succession crisis took place in 1018, or about 19 years before the actual construction of the Golden Gate in 1037.

It is plausible, though, that Boleslaus did chip his sword by striking it against an earlier gate in Kiev. His great-grandson, Boleslaus the Bold (), hit the Golden Gate with a sword in 1069, which would indicate that it was a customary gesture of gaining control over a city. It is also possible that this sword was preserved as a souvenir of past victories venerated by Boleslaus the Brave&#x27;s successors. According to Wincenty Kadłubek&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot;, Boleslaus Wrymouth () had a favorite sword he called &quot;Żuraw&quot; or &quot;Grus&quot; (&quot;Crane&quot;). A scribe who copied the chronicle in 1450 added the word &quot;Szczurbycz&quot; above the word &quot;Żuraw&quot;, but whether these two swords were one and the same is uncertain.

According to the &quot;Chronicle of Greater Poland&quot;, the sword was kept in the treasury of the Wawel Cathedral. The ultimate fate of the original Szczerbiec is unknown. It may have been taken to Prague, together with other royal insignia, by King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia after his coronation as king of Poland in Gniezno in 1300. What happened with these insignia thereafter remains a mystery. Although Boleslaus the Brave&#x27;s notched sword has not been preserved and even its very existence is doubtful, its legend had a great impact on Polish historical memory and the treatment of its successor, the modern Szczerbiec.

=== From a sword of justice to a coronation sword ===
The sword currently known as Szczerbiec was forged and decorated in a style characteristic of the late 12th and 13th centuries, so it could not have belonged to any of the three great Boleslauses of the 11th and early 12th centuries. Additionally, it is a purely ceremonial sword which, unlike the original Szczerbiec, was never used in combat. It was originally used as a sword of justice (&quot;gladius iustitiae&quot;), or insignia of the sovereign&#x27;s judicial power, by one of the many local dukes during Poland&#x27;s Age of Fragmentation. A silver plate, now lost, on the sword&#x27;s grip bore an inscription which indicated a duke by the name Boleslaus as its original owner. An inscription on the Radziwiłłs&#x27; replica of Szczerbiec, now also lost, could provide an additional hint as to the duke&#x27;s identity: &quot;Boleslaus, Duke of Poland, Masovia, and Łęczyca&quot; – except that no duke of this name and titles ever existed. Historians have variously identified the duke in question as Boleslaus the Curly (), Boleslaus the Chaste (), Boleslaus I of Masovia () or Boleslaus the Pious of Greater Poland ().

As a coronation sword, Szczerbiec was first specifically mentioned by Jan Długosz in his account of the crowning of King Casimir IV (), but it was probably first used in a coronation ceremony by King Ladislaus the Short () in 1320, by which time he had reunited most of the core territories of Poland. If Szczerbiec had previously belonged to his uncle, Boleslaus I of Masovia, or his father-in-law, Boleslaus the Pious, then he could have inherited it. If it had belonged to any of the two Boleslauses who had ruled from Kraków as high dukes of all Poland, then Ladislaus could have simply found it in the Wawel Cathedral. Thereafter, Szczerbiec became an integral part of the Polish Crown Jewels, shared their fate, and was the principal ceremonial sword used in coronations of all Polish kings until 1764, except Jogaila (1386), Stephen Báthory (1576), Stanislaus I Leszczyński (1705), and Augustus III Wettin (1734).

Szczerbiec, together with other crown jewels, was removed from the Wawel Hill on several occasions during that period. After his Polish coronation in 1370, King Louis I of Hungary took the crown jewels with him to Buda; his successor on the Hungarian throne, Emperor Sigismund, rendered them to Poland in 1412. On two occasions, in mid-17th and early 18th centuries, they were evacuated across Poland&#x27;s southern border to protect them from invading Swedish armies. In 1733, during the War of the Polish Succession, supporters of King Stanislaus I concealed the jewels in a Warsaw church for three years to prevent Augustus III from using them in his coronation. In 1764, they were sent to Warsaw again, to be used in a coronation for the last time – that of Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski. They were returned to Kraków afterwards.

During a typical Polish coronation ceremony in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the king-elect received Szczerbiec after his anointment and before being crowned and enthroned. The primate of Poland, that is the archbishop of Gniezno, picked up the unsheathed sword from the altar and handed it to the kneeling king. At the same time, he recited a formula which asked the monarch to use the sword to rule justly, defend the Church, fight evil, protect widows and orphans, and to &quot;rebuild what is damaged, maintain what is rebuilt, avenge what is unjust, reinforce what is well managed,&quot; etc. Then, the king handed the sword to the Crown sword-bearer (&quot;miecznik koronny&quot;), who slid it into the scabbard and passed on to the primate. The primate, aided by the Crown and Lithuanian sword-bearers, fastened the scabbard to the king&#x27;s belt. The king stood up and, facing onlookers, withdrew Szczerbiec, made three times the sign of the cross with it, and wiped it against his left arm before replacing it in the scabbard. The king&#x27;s sword-wielding abilities were closely watched by his new subjects during this part of the ritual. When Augustus III betrayed his poor fencing skills at his coronation, nobles joked that they were going to have &quot;a peaceful lord&quot;. After Szczerbiec, a bishop handed the sovereign the Grunwald Swords symbolizing the monarch&#x27;s reign over the two constituent nations of the Commonwealth.

Throughout the period from Casimir the Great () to Stanislaus Augustus, Polish crown jewels were commonly believed to date back to the times of Boleslaus the Brave. This conviction helped maintain a sense of continuity of Polish statehood and provide legitimacy for the nation&#x27;s kings, implicitly making each Polish monarch a successor of the ancient and glorious legacy of the first king of the House of Piast. Accordingly, the coronation sword took over the name and the legend of the original Szczerbiec. The corrosion-induced slit in the blade became associated with the fabled &quot;szczerba&quot;, or notch that Boleslaus had purportedly made on his sword in Kiev. The power of tradition was so strong that when Stanislaus Augustus&#x27;s court painter, Marcello Bacciarelli, who had made detailed studies of Polish crown jewels, painted an imaginary portrait of Boleslaus the Brave, he chose to depict Szczerbiec so that its appearance agreed with legend rather than reality. The images of the coronation crown and sword are overall meticulously accurate, but Bacciarelli&#x27;s Szczerbiec lacks the slit and has a chipped edge instead.
=== In foreign hands ===
In 1794, during the failed Kościuszko Uprising which led to the final partition of Poland a year later, Prussian troops captured Kraków. In the following year, on King Frederick William II&#x27;s orders, the treasure vault of the Wawel Castle was looted and the crown jewels taken to Breslau (now Wrocław in Poland), then to Berlin, and finally to Königsberg (now Kaliningrad in Russia). Between 1809 and 1811 most of the jewels were melted down, but some, including Szczerbiec, were put up for sale. The coronation sword was acquired by the future Russian minister of justice, Prince Dmitry Lobanov-Rostovsky, who probably hoped to resell it to one of Polish aristocrats. In 1819, he approached General Wincenty Krasiński, speaker of the Sejm (parliament) of the &quot;Congress&quot; Kingdom of Poland. The prince did not disclose the actual source of the sword and claimed to have bought it in Moscow from an Armenian merchant who had found the weapon somewhere between Belgrade and Rusçuk (now Ruse in Bulgaria) during the recent Russo-Turkish War. Krasiński, who was a known antique weapon collector, suspected it could be Szczerbiec, but asked Prof. Sebastiano Ciampi, a historian of the Warsaw University, for opinion. Ciampi examined the lithography Krasiński had had made of the sword, but was unsure whether it was the actual Szczerbiec. As a consequence, Krasiński declined Lobanov-Rostovsky&#x27;s offer.

Lobanov-Rostovsky ultimately sold Szczerbiec to Prince Anatoly Demidov, who kept it together with the rest of the Demidov collection in his Villa San Donato near Florence. In 1870, the sword was bought for 20,000 French francs by Alexander Basilevsky, Russian ambassador to France and great art collector. In 1878, he displayed Szczerbiec at the World&#x27;s Fair in Paris. By that time, the scabbard had been lost and the sword itself was presented as of Teutonic origin. It was seen by several Polish visitors who speculated whether it could be the Polish coronation sword. In 1884, the entire Basilevsky collection was purchased by Emperor Alexander III of Russia for the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. Both Polish and other experts at the time expressed doubts as to the authenticity of Szczerbiec held in Russia&#x27;s largest museum &quot;(see Historical replicas below)&quot;. An international museum congress held in Saint Petersburg in 1913 pronounced the sword a 17th-century replica.

In 1917, as a result of the October Revolution, Russia became a communist state. In the aftermath of World War I, Poland reemerged as an independent country in the following year. From 1919 to 1921, the two states fought the Polish–Soviet War which was concluded with the Peace of Riga. Article 11 of the peace treaty required that the Soviet side return all culturally significant collections and items that had been removed from Poland since the First Partition in 1772. A special bilateral committee was set up to carry out the restitution of cultural goods. In 1928, the committee&#x27;s efforts resulted in the return to Poland of, among other national treasures, Szczerbiec, which, after 133 years, was deposited back in the Wawel Castle.

=== Evacuation in World War II ===
On 3 September 1939, two days after Germany invaded Poland triggering the Second World War, began the evacuation of the most precious national treasures, including Szczerbiec, from the Wawel Castle. The cargo was transported on barges, wagons, buses and trucks to Romania. From there, it was shipped by sea to France and later to Britain. On the way from Bordeaux to Falmouth, the ship carrying Polish national treasures came under fire from the Luftwaffe. Karol Estreicher, who oversaw the evacuation, decided then to remove Szczerbiec from a chest and sandwich it between two wooden planks, and to attach to them an explanatory message in a bottle – so that in the event that the ship was sunk, at least the coronation sword could be salvaged. When the German bombing of Britain began in July 1940, the valuables were transported aboard the Polish ocean liner MS &quot;Batory&quot; to Canada and finally deposited at the Polish consulate and then other locations in Ottawa. After the war, one of the custodians of the national treasures, who remained loyal to the London-based Polish government-in-exile, was reluctant to return them to Poland, which had fallen under communist rule and Soviet influence. After lengthy negotiations, the first batch of the most important objects, including Szczerbiec, was ultimately returned in 1959; the rest followed in 1961. Since then, the Polish coronation sword has been on permanent display in the treasure vault of the Wawel Castle.

== Historical replicas ==
A treasury inventory of the Radziwiłł family&#x27;s Nieśwież Castle (now Nesvizh in Belarus) made in 1740 includes a detailed description of a sword decorated with symbols of the Evangelists and inscriptions identical to those on Szczerbiec. According to the inventory, it was a gift from Crown Prince Jakub Sobieski to Prince Michał Radziwiłł, but the original source of the supposed replica was not given. An inventory made in 1738 of the treasure vault of the Sobieski family&#x27;s Żółkiew Castle (now Zhovkva in Ukraine) mentions &quot;an estoc (&quot;koncerz&quot;) covered with golden plates bearing images of the Four Evangelists; Skanderbek&#x27;s.&quot; Based on this record, historian Aleksander Czołowski hypothesized that a replica of Szczerbiec was forged as early as 1457 and awarded to George Kastrioti Skanderbeg, the national leader of Albania, in recognition of his victory over the Ottoman forces (see Battle of Ujëbardha). After King John III Sobieski defeated the Ottomans in the Battle of Vienna in 1683, Albanians presumably returned the sword to him. His son, Jakub, possibly passed it on to Michał Radziwiłł as a present.

There are doubts, however, whether the swords known to have been at Żółkiew in 1738 and at Nieśwież two years later, were in fact the same sword. The Radziwiłłs&#x27; castle was plundered by the Russian army in 1812 and the subsequent fate of their replica of Szczerbiec is unknown. This fact cast doubts over the authenticity of Szczerbiec held in the Hermitage. Some experts suspected that the sword possessed by the Russian imperial museum was in fact the Nieśwież replica, not part of the original royal insignia.

Another historically notable replica of Szczerbiec was produced probably in Dresden, Saxony, at the time when the original was in Prussian hands. It is modest and inexact; the handle is carved in bovine bone and the niello is imitated with black paint. Designs on the handle are patterned on those of the genuine Szczerbiec, except that the crosses and letters on the pommel were replaced with the coat of arms of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The blade was initially shorter than that of the original, actually typical for a stiletto. It was purchased in Dresden by art historian Edward Rastawiecki, who in 1869 donated it to the archeological collection of the Jagiellonian University of Kraków. The university lost it during the German occupation in World War II. After the war, the replica found itself in the hands of Tadeusz Janowski who smuggled it to the United States in 1947. At around that time, the short stiletto blade was replaced with a long blade of a 16th-century German sword. To imitate Szczerbiec, a slit was cut in the blade and small heraldic shields were attached to it on both sides. During the communist rule in Poland, the Polish American community of Chicago treated the replica as a symbol of Poland&#x27;s independence. In 1968, it was demonstrated to U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy while he was meeting with Polish Americans during his presidential campaign. Janowski returned the sword to the Jagiellonian University in 2003.

== Modern symbolism ==

In the interwar period, a simplified image of Szczerbiec wrapped three times in a white-and-red ribbon was adopted as a symbol of Polish nationalist organizations led by Roman Dmowski – the Camp of Great Poland (&quot;Obóz Wielkiej Polski&quot;), the National Party (&quot;Stronnictwo Narodowe&quot;), and the All-Polish Youth (&quot;Młodzież Wszechpolska&quot;). Their members wore it as a badge called &quot;&quot;, or &quot;Little Sword of [Boleslaus] the Brave&quot;. The symbol was also sewn onto the left sleeve of the sand shirt which was part of the Camp of Great Poland uniform. Among the politicians who wore the badge before World War II were Roman Dmowski, Władysław Grabski, Wojciech Korfanty, Roman Rybarski, and Wojciech Jaruzelski. It was banned in 1938 during the &quot;Sanation&quot; period. During World War II, the badge was used by right-wing anti-Nazi and anti-Soviet military resistance groups, the National Armed Forces (&quot;Narodowe Siły Zbrojne&quot;) and the National Military Organization (&quot;Narodowa Organizacja Wojskowa&quot;). After the fall of communism in Poland, the &quot;Mieczyk Chrobrego&quot; symbol was readopted by new or reactivated nationalist and far-right organizations, including League of Polish Families (&quot;Liga Polskich Rodzin&quot;), All-Polish Youth and the Camp of Great Poland. Additionally, &quot;Szczerbiec&quot; is the title of a periodical published since 1991 by a minor radical nationalist party, the National Revival of Poland (&quot;Narodowe Odrodzenie Polski&quot;).

In 2005, the Polish Football Association, in an attempt to fight racism among Polish football fans, prepared a blacklist of most common racist and fascist symbols to be banned from Polish football stadiums. The catalog, co-authored by independent anti-fascist organization Never Again (&quot;Nigdy Więcej&quot;), listed the &quot;Mieczyk Chrobrego&quot; as one of the extreme right symbols that are often displayed at the Polish stadiums. The catalog listed other racist and fascist symbols like the Nazi swastika, the Celtic cross, and the Confederate Flag. After a protest by MEP Sylwester Chruszcz of the League of Polish Families, additional consultations were held with historians, academic researchers and other experts and as a result the symbol is still listed in the catalog of extreme-right symbols banned at Polish football stadiums. It was also banned by UEFA during Euro 2008 and 2012.

The symbolic use of Szczerbiec became a bone of contention again in 2009. After a monument to the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (&quot;Ukrayins&#x27;ka Povstans&#x27;ka Armiya&quot;) on the Mountain in southeastern Poland was vandalized, authorities of the Ukrainian city of Lviv demanded the removal of an image of Szczerbiec from the local Polish military cemetery. The Ukrainians, recalling the legendary use of the original sword in a Polish invasion of Kiev, argued it was a Polish nationalist, militaristic and anti-Ukrainian symbol.

<text>Pilbara Iron manages assets for Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto, and Robe River Iron Associates, an unincorporated joint venture between Rio Tinto (53%) and Japanese steel companies Mitsui Iron Ore Development (33%) and Nippon Steel (14%).
All of these companies are involved in the mining of iron ore, predominantly from the Pilbara region of Western Australia.

All of these companies are involved in the mining of iron ore, predominantly from the Pilbara region of Western Australia.

In 2004, it was announced that Hamersley and Robe River would merge their operations as Pilbara Iron. The concept had been tested by the formation of Pilbara Rail in 2001, which generated more than $16 million in savings. Pilbara Rail was folded into Pilbara Iron in 2005. Each company continues to market products separately and retains ownership and profits from the underlying mines, as well as strategic development of their own mineral resources. Each company continues to market products separately and retains ownership and profits from the underlying mines, as well as strategic development of their own mineral resources.

==Current mine sites==
Mine sites currently operating:
All iron ore mined at the sites is transported on the Hamersley &amp; Robe River railway, one of the world&#x27;s largest privately owned railways to Dampier and Cape Lambert. From there the ore is shipped across the world, with China and Japan the largest markets as of 2007.

==Historical events==
July 1962: Hamersley Holdings Pty Ltd is formed to develop deposits in the Hamersley Range.

September 1962: Thomas Moore Price dies shortly after receiving news of the discovery of promising deposits at what would later be called Mount Tom Price.

August 1963, Hamersley Holdings Pty Ltd, a subsidiary owned by Conzinc-Riotinto of Australia (60%) and Kaiser Steel (40%), signed a 30-year agreement with the Government of Western Australia for the development of iron ore leases held by the company and for the eventual establishment of an integrated iron and steel industry. The $175 million over 30 years program was established in anticipation of supplying iron ore to the Japanese steel industry.

February 1964: a proposal is announced for Hamersley Iron to export 65 million tons over 15 years starting in 1967 to the Japanese steel industry. Reserves estimated at five billion tons of 50% to 66% by Kaiser Steel. Ten involved Japanese steel works cited in the &quot;Iron Age&quot; article.

1964: Japanese firms sign contract to buy five million tons from the Western Mining Corporation for $69 million with deliveries to start in 1966.

January 1965: Hamersley Iron signed a contract to sell over a 15 year period starting in 1966 65.5 million tons at a price of $600 million. A 176 mile railway line and a port at King Bay for ore carriers up to 100,000 tons was to be constructed. Mount Goldsworthy Mining Associated, a joint venture of Cyprus Mines Corporation of Los Angeles, Utah Construction Company of San Francisco, Consolidated Gold Fields of London, signed a $164 million contract for 16.5 million tons of Western Australia ore with Japanese buyers. Also a $60 million contract for pellets from Tasmania to Japan was signed at the time. Reported as a 82 million tons, $757 million over 17 year contract by &quot;International Commerce&quot;.

June 1965: Hamersley Iron agreed to sell 16 million tons of iron ore pellets to Japan at one million tons per year and planned to build a pelletizing plant at King Bay.

August 1965: Hamersley agreed to sell to Kobe Steel $16 million worth of low grade iron ore from Mount Tom Price bringing the total in sales contracts to $825 million.

* May 1967 – Hamersley Holdings shares list on the Australian Securities Exchange in the largest Initial Public Offering in Australian history
* May 1974 – Hamersley Europe Pty. Limited incorporated

In June 1979, Kaiser Steel sold its 28% shareholding in Hamersley Holdings to Conzinc Riotinto for $207.5 million, bringing the Rio Tinto share of the company to 82%.

<doc id="39744" wikidata="Q1877182" url="?curid=39744" title="Lullingstone Roman Villa">
<text>Lullingstone Roman Villa is a villa built during the Roman occupation of Britain, situated in Lullingstone near the village of Eynsford in Kent, south-eastern England. The villa is located in the Darent Valley, along with six others, including those at Crofton, Crayford and Dartford. Constructed in the 1st century, perhaps around 80–90 AD, the house was repeatedly expanded and occupied until it was destroyed by fire in the 4th or 5th century. The villa was occupied over various periods within the Romano-British period, but after its destruction, it is only thought to have been reoccupied during the medieval period. The occupants were most likely wealthy Romans or native Britons who had adopted Roman customs.

Some evidence found on site suggests that around 150 AD, the villa was considerably enlarged and may have been used as the country retreat of the governors of the Roman province of Britannia. Two sculpted marble busts found in the cellar may be those of Pertinax, governor in 185–186, and his father-in-law, Publius Helvius Successus. In the 4th century a room, probably already in religious use, was converted to a Christian chapel or house church, much the earliest known in the British Isles.

In the Anglo-Saxon period, the ruins of a Roman temple-mausoleum on the site of the villa were incorporated into a Christian chapel (Lullingstone Chapel) that was extant at the time of the Norman Conquest, one of the earliest known chapels in the country.

In addition to the pagan shrine in the villa&#x27;s chapel and the dining room mosaics, the villa produced significant artistic finds including the Lullingstone Victory Gem and the busts.

==History==
===Construction===
The earliest part of the villa was built around 82 AD. It was situated in an area near to several other villas, and was close to Watling Street, a Roman road by which travellers could move to and from Londinium, Durobrivae, Durovernum Cantiacorum, and the major Roman port of Rutupiæ (i.e., London, Rochester, Canterbury, and Richborough, respectively).

===Enlargement===
Around 150 AD the villa was expanded and a heated bath block with hypocaust was added, but it was later rebuilt around 290 AD after being abandoned for almost a century. Two marble busts from the 2nd century found in the cellar perhaps depict the owners or residents of the villa, which may have been the designated country retreat of the provincial governors. There is some evidence that the busts are those of Pertinax, governor of Britannia in 185–186 (and later Roman emperor in 193), and his father.

In the 3rd century, a larger furnace for the hypocaust as well as an expanded bath block were added, as were a temple-mausoleum and a large granary. In the 4th century, the dining room was equipped with a fine mosaic floor with one illustration of Zeus or Jupiter, disguised as a bull, abducting Europa and a second depicting Bellerophon killing the Chimera.

===Destruction and rediscovery===
Sometime early in the 5th century, a fire destroyed the building, and it was abandoned and forgotten until its excavation in the 20th century.

The first discovery of the site was made in 1750, when workers fencing a deer park dug post holes through a mosaic floor. While the discovery and some additional evidence was noted, no further excavation took place.

It wasn&#x27;t until 1939 that the ruins of the villa were rediscovered by E. Greensfield and E. Birchenough when they noticed evidence of Roman walls and mosaic fragments beneath a blown-down tree. In the mid-20th century (1949–1961) the site was finally excavated by multiple teams of archaeologists. Until this first excavation, the villa and the rest of the Lullingstone ruins had remained untouched since its destruction. The ruins themselves were preserved under a specially designed cover in the 1960s, when the villa was taken over by English Heritage, who opened the ruins to the public. The building began to leak late in the 20th century and required a major £1.8m renovation and display project in 2006 to 2008 so artefacts from the Lullingstone site could be safely displayed within it.

In his excavation reports, Lieutenant-Colonel G. W. Meates covers the initial excavation of the site, including the discovery of the boundaries of the villa, coin and pottery evidence, and various rooms that were discovered. In the two earliest reports, Meates creates a rough timeline of the Lullingstone Villa ranging from the 1st century AD until the Post-Roman periods, including its purposes, room construction, abandonment, and its final destruction. In addition to the timeline and room descriptions, there are also detailed reports of the evidence found, such as pottery, coins, and soil and clay levels which indicate the time periods in which the villa is being observed.

=== Eras of occupation ===

==== 1st century AD ====
During the original excavations of the site in the 1950s, evidence from various centuries was discovered, creating a timeline for the villa. The earliest evidence comes from the 1st century AD. Many shards of pottery were found on the slope that the excavation site was located on. The shards found are considered to be hand-made with elements of &quot;Belgic culture&quot;.

==== 2nd century AD: the Flavian to Antonine period ====
At the original excavation, the full extent of the house built and maintained during the Flavian dynasty to the Nerva-Antonine dynasty was unknown. However, it is thought that the Bath Room and the Basement Room may have been built during this era. From geological evidence, such as different layers of clay, it is suggested that the few stairs leading to the basement were built during this period rather than the 4th century AD, as originally thought.

==== 3rd century AD ====
Based on pottery evidence, it is thought that the Lullingstone Roman Villa was abandoned for at least the first half of the 3rd century AD. Coins found at the site provide evidence that the occupation of the villa resumed sometime during the last half of the 3rd century during the reigns of Claudius II and Allectus. It is thought that the pagan shrine and other Christian rooms were constructed during this era after the period of abandonment. In addition to the Christian elements that were added to the villa, the 3rd century AD was also when some of the villa&#x27;s main external buildings, including the granary and the temple, were constructed.

==== 4th century AD ====
The 4th century was an eventful era for the villa, with large renovations taking place, and probably the fire. Some of the renovations of the villa include the designing of the mosaic floor in Room 5 and the construction of another room. Excavators were able to date the construction of the mosaic floor in Room 5 using coins depicting Constantine II that were accidentally mixed into the concrete.

==== Post-Roman period ====
At the initial excavation in the 1950s, there was no evidence that suggested occupation of the villa or its site from its destruction until at least medieval times. From English Heritage, there is documentation of some findings including a &quot;hanging bowl&quot; and other Anglo-Saxon potsherds. This evidence suggests that the site may have been used as a burial ground in early Anglo-Saxon Britain.

==Rooms==


===Dining room===
Rooms 12 and 13, previously known as Rooms 9 and 10, include the dining room, or &quot;triclinium&quot;, which was situated in the centre of the main building. As the largest room in the villa on the western side, it connected all other rooms to the north and south together via a large verandah. The dining room was highly decorated with a pair of large mosaics on the floor dating to the mid-4th century. One depicts the abduction of the princess Europa by the god Jupiter or Zeus who is disguised as a bull, whilst the other depicts Bellerophon slaying the Chimera, whilst surrounded by four sea creatures, including dolphins. In each of the four corners of the Bellerophon mosaic there is a bust of the seasons personified including winter, spring, summer, and autumn. Surrounding these mosaics were smaller images depicting hearts, crosses and swastikas. Even though these artworks are usually only seen as depictions of myth, it is also thought by some scholars that these works were meant to ward off the evil eye. Based on the artwork and the shape of the apse, it is thought that this room was also meant for entertaining. With the measurements of the apse being 6.25 metres by 4.88 metres at its largest points, the dining room was spacious, with potentially enough room to contain a couch. The couch, usually able to seat three people, would have been 1.5 metres to 2 metres in width, and directly facing the mosaic artwork so that it could be viewed in the correct orientation by all visitors.

=== Bath Wing ===
Thought to have been constructed in the Flavian–Antonine period, the Bath Wing was renovated and constantly used throughout the villa&#x27;s existence. After the abandonment of the villa for almost a century, the Bath Wing was renovated, though the details of renovations are not mentioned. During the initial excavations, it was noted that the Bath Wing contained what G. W. Meates called a &quot;combustion chamber&quot;. This chamber, filled with chalk, also shows evidence of burned charcoal that may have been used for heating.

=== Basement Room ===
During the original excavations of the site, it was thought that during its periods of use the Basement Room had multiple purposes, including as a garden room. It should also be noted that the term &#x27;basement&#x27; cannot be interpreted to have the same meaning as the modern word. The walls of the room were highly decorated including orange, red, and green panels. Based on the archaeological and artistic evidence, the original height of the room is thought to have been 8 feet. When the villa was abandoned, the Basement Room was especially affected. Much of the walls and stairs were stripped of their materials, and were not replaced until the reoccupation of the villa. During the reoccupation, the walls of the Basement Room were redecorated and other details such as pottery were added. Partially destroyed by the fire, parts of the mosaic and the plaster from the room above fell into the Basement Room providing an abundance of intact evidence for the villa, which remained untouched until the beginning of the Lullingstone excavations in 1949.

===Pagan shrine and Christian chapel===
One room of the building had been used as both a pagan shrine and, later, as a Christian chapel, one of the earliest in Britain. Along with the Christian chapel, there were three or four other rooms that were also used for Christian purposes including a possible Antechamber and a Vestibule.

The original pagan shrine room was dedicated to local water deities, and a wall painting depicting three water nymphs dating from this period can still be seen in a niche in the room.

Just after the 3rd century, this niche had been covered over, as the whole room had been redecorated with white plaster painted with red bands, and two busts of male figures had been placed in the room. Some scholars have theorised that at this point the inhabitants focused their worship on household deities and ancestor spirits, largely abandoning the worship of the water deities.

In the 4th century the room above the pagan shrine was apparently converted to Christian use, with painted plaster on the walls, including a row of figures of standing worshipers (orans), and a characteristic Christian Chi-rho symbol. Some of the paintings are now on display in the British Museum.

According to English Heritage, which maintains the site:
The overall purpose of the chapel other than worship is not certain, but it is thought that it was used for &quot;liturgical worship&quot; such as baptisms. Based on the fact that the Christian artwork was large in size, K. S. Painter suggests that the owners of the villa at this time were not only Christians, but also wealthy.

===Graves===
A Romano-Celtic temple-mausoleum complex was constructed around 300 AD to hold the bodies of two young people, those of a male and a female, in lead coffins. Although the young woman&#x27;s coffin was robbed in antiquity, the other remained in situ and undisturbed, and is now on display at the site.

== Art and artefacts ==

=== The Victory Gem ===

Discovered during the initial excavations by G.W. Meates, the Victory Gem is a &quot;Roman cornelian intaglio&quot;. Cornelian intaglios like this were normally set in rings, and based on its size, it is thought that its ring was large. Measuring 23 by 19 by 5 mm, it is one of the largest gems ever found in Britain. Considering the potential size of the ring and other remnants of precious metals on the gem, such as gold, Martin Henig suggests that the ring was once owned by a man that held both high status and wealth. The gem depicts personified Victory writing a message of triumph on a shield. It is thought that the gem has Greek characteristics as the artwork depicts elements of the goddesses Nike and Aphrodite.

=== Busts ===
The two marble busts found in the Basement Room are thought to represent Pertinax, governor in 185–186 AD, and his father, Publius Helvius Successus. Some scholars suggest that these two busts provide insight into who occupied the villa in at least the 2nd century. One of the busts is thought to date to the Hadrianic period. Though they are both quite well preserved, the second, and larger of the busts was more damaged when it was found during the initial excavations. According to excavation reports, it is not entirely certain why they were placed in the Basement Room. It was noted, however, that after the period of abandonment, those who reoccupied the villa may have decided to keep them for their own purposes.

<text>The stomach is also called the gaster (Greek &quot;belly&quot;) or venter from which we have the adjective gastric applied to structures related to the organ. The stomach is a muscular, hollow organ in the upper gastrointestinal tract of humans and many other animals, including several invertebrates. The stomach has a dilated structure and functions as a vital organ in the digestive system. The stomach is involved in the gastric phase of digestion, following the cephalic phase in which the sight and smell of food and the act of chewing are stimuli. In the stomach a chemical breakdown of food takes place by means of secreted digestive enzymes and gastric acid. It also plays a role in regulating gut microbiota, influencing digestion and overall health.

The stomach is located between the esophagus and the small intestine. The pyloric sphincter controls the passage of partially digested food (chyme) from the stomach into the duodenum, the first and shortest part of the small intestine, where peristalsis takes over to move this through the rest of the intestines.

==Structure==
In the human digestive system, the stomach lies between the esophagus and the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). It is in the left upper quadrant of the abdominal cavity. The top of the stomach lies against the diaphragm. Lying behind the stomach is the pancreas. A large double fold of visceral peritoneum called the greater omentum hangs down from the greater curvature of the stomach. Two sphincters keep the contents of the stomach contained; the lower esophageal sphincter (found in the cardiac region), at the junction of the esophagus and stomach, and the pyloric sphincter at the junction of the stomach with the duodenum.

The stomach is surrounded by parasympathetic (inhibitor) and sympathetic (stimulant) plexuses (networks of blood vessels and nerves in the anterior gastric, posterior, superior and inferior, celiac and myenteric), which regulate both the secretory activity of the stomach and the motor (motion) activity of its muscles.

The stomach is , and can normally expand to hold about one litre of food. The shape of the stomach depends upon the degree of its distension and that of surrounding viscera, e.g. the colon. When empty, the stomach is somewhat J-shaped; when partially distended, it becomes pyriform in shape. In obese persons, it is more horizontal. In a newborn human baby the stomach will only be able to hold about 30 millilitres. The maximum stomach volume in adults is between 2 and 4 litres, although volumes of up to 15 litres have been observed in extreme circumstances.

=== Sections ===

The human stomach can be divided into four sections, beginning at the cardia followed by the fundus, the body and the pylorus.
* The gastric cardia is where the contents of the esophagus empty from the gastroesophageal sphincter into the cardiac orifice, the opening into the gastric cardia. A cardiac notch at the left of the cardiac orifice, marks the beginning of the greater curvature of the stomach. A horizontal line across from the cardiac notch gives the dome-shaped region called the fundus. The cardia is a very small region of the stomach that surrounds the esophageal opening.
* The fundus () is formed in the upper curved part.
* The body or corpus is the main, central region of the stomach.
* The pylorus opens to the body of the stomach. The pylorus () connects the stomach to the duodenum at the pyloric sphincter.

The cardia is defined as the region following the &quot;z-line&quot; of the gastroesophageal junction, the point at which the epithelium changes from stratified squamous to columnar. Near the cardia is the lower esophageal sphincter.

=== Anatomical proximity ===
The stomach bed refers to the structures upon which the stomach rests in mammals. These include the tail of the pancreas, splenic artery, left kidney, left suprarenal gland, transverse colon and its mesocolon, and the left crus of diaphragm, and the left colic flexure. The term was introduced around 1896 by Philip Polson of the Catholic University School of Medicine, Dublin. However this was brought into disrepute by surgeon anatomist J Massey.

=== Blood supply ===
The lesser curvature of the human stomach is supplied by the right gastric artery inferiorly and the left gastric artery superiorly, which also supplies the cardiac region. The greater curvature is supplied by the right gastroepiploic artery inferiorly and the left gastroepiploic artery superiorly. The fundus of the stomach, and also the upper portion of the greater curvature, is supplied by 5-7 short gastric arteries, which arise from the splenic artery.

===Lymphatic drainage===
The two sets of gastric lymph nodes drain the stomach&#x27;s tissue fluid into the lymphatic system.

Note that lymph from all areas of the stomach ultimately reaches the coeliac nodes. From here it passes through the &quot;intestinal lymph trunk&quot; to reach the &quot;cisterna chyli.&quot;

===Microanatomy===
====Wall====


Like the other parts of the gastrointestinal wall, the human stomach wall from inner to outer, consists of a mucosa, submucosa, muscular layer, subserosa and serosa.

The inner part of the stomach wall is the gastric mucosa a mucous membrane that forms the lining of the stomach. the membrane consists of an outer layer of columnar epithelium, a lamina propria, and a thin layer of smooth muscle called the muscularis mucosa. Beneath the mucosa lies the submucosa, consisting of fibrous connective tissue. Meissner&#x27;s plexus is in this layer interior to the oblique muscle layer.

Outside of the submucosa lies the muscular layer. It consists of three layers of muscular fibres, with fibres lying at angles to each other. These are the inner oblique, middle circular, and outer longitudinal layers. The presence of the inner oblique layer is distinct from other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, which do not possess this layer. The stomach contains the thickest muscular layer consisting of three layers, thus maximum peristalsis occurs here.
* The &quot;inner oblique layer:&quot; This layer is responsible for creating the motion that churns and physically breaks down the food. It is the only layer of the three which is not seen in other parts of the digestive system. The antrum has thicker skin cells in its walls and performs more forceful contractions than the fundus.
* The &quot;middle circular layer:&quot; At this layer, the pylorus is surrounded by a thick circular muscular wall, which is normally tonically constricted, forming a functional (if not anatomically discrete) pyloric sphincter, which controls the movement of chyme into the duodenum. This layer is concentric to the longitudinal axis of the stomach.
* The myenteric plexus (Auerbach&#x27;s plexus) is found between the outer longitudinal and the middle circular layer and is responsible for the innervation of both (causing peristalsis and mixing).

The &quot;outer longitudinal layer&quot; is responsible for moving the semi-digested food towards the pylorus of the stomach through muscular shortening.

To the outside of the muscular layer lies a serosa, consisting of layers of connective tissue continuous with the peritoneum.

Smooth mucosa along the inside of the lesser curvature forms a passageway - the gastric canal that fast-tracks liquids entering the stomach, to the pylorus.

====Glands====


The mucosa lining the stomach is lined with gastric pits, which receive gastric juice, secreted by between 2 and 7 gastric glands. Gastric juice is an acidic fluid containing hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes. The glands contains a number of cells, with the function of the glands changing depending on their position within the stomach.

Within the body and fundus of the stomach lie the &quot;fundic glands&quot;. In general, these glands are lined by column-shaped cells that secrete a protective layer of mucus and bicarbonate. Additional cells present include parietal cells that secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor, chief cells that secrete pepsinogen (this is a precursor to pepsin- the highly acidic environment converts the pepsinogen to pepsin), and neuroendocrine cells that secrete serotonin.

Glands differ where the stomach meets the esophagus and near the pylorus. Near the gastroesophageal junction lie &quot;cardiac glands&quot;, which primarily secrete mucus. They are fewer in number than the other gastric glands and are more shallowly positioned in the mucosa. There are two kinds - either simple tubular glands with short ducts or compound racemose resembling the duodenal Brunner&#x27;s glands. Near the pylorus lie &quot;pyloric glands&quot; located in the antrum of the pylorus. They secrete mucus, as well as gastrin produced by their G cells.

=== Gene and protein expression ===

About 20,000 protein-coding genes are expressed in human cells and nearly 70% of these genes are expressed in the normal stomach. Just over 150 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the stomach compared to other organs, with only some 20 genes being highly specific. The corresponding specific proteins expressed in stomach are mainly involved in creating a suitable environment for handling the digestion of food for uptake of nutrients. Highly stomach-specific proteins include gastrokine-1 expressed in the mucosa; pepsinogen and gastric lipase, expressed in gastric chief cells; and a gastric ATPase and gastric intrinsic factor, expressed in parietal cells.

==Development==
In the early part of the development of the human embryo, the ventral part of the embryo abuts the yolk sac. During the third week of development, as the embryo grows, it begins to surround parts of the yolk sac. The enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract. The sac is surrounded by a network of vitelline arteries and veins. Over time, these arteries consolidate into the three main arteries that supply the developing gastrointestinal tract: the celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric artery. The areas supplied by these arteries are used to define the foregut, midgut, and hindgut. The surrounded sac becomes the primitive gut. Sections of this gut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, and the esophagus, and stomach form from the foregut.

As the stomach rotates during early development, the dorsal and ventral mesentery rotate with it; this rotation produces a space anterior to the expanding stomach called the greater sac, and a space posterior to the stomach called the lesser sac. After this rotation the dorsal mesentery thins and forms the greater omentum, which is attached to the greater curvature of the stomach. The ventral mesentery forms the lesser omentum, and is attached to the developing liver. In the adult, these connective structures of omentum and mesentery form the peritoneum, and act as an insulating and protective layer while also supplying organs with blood and lymph vessels as well as nerves. Arterial supply to all these structures is from the celiac trunk, and venous drainage is by the portal venous system. Lymph from these organs is drained to the prevertebral celiac nodes at the origin of the celiac artery from the aorta.

==Function==
===Digestion===
In the human digestive system, a bolus (a small rounded mass of chewed up food) enters the stomach through the esophagus via the lower esophageal sphincter. The stomach releases proteases (protein-digesting enzymes such as pepsin), and hydrochloric acid, which kills or inhibits bacteria and provides the acidic pH of 2 for the proteases to work. Food is churned by the stomach through peristaltic muscular contractions of the wall – reducing the volume of the bolus, before looping around the fundus and the body of stomach as the boluses are converted into chyme (partially digested food). Chyme slowly passes through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum of the small intestine, where the extraction of nutrients begins.

Gastric juice in the stomach also contains pepsinogen. Hydrochloric acid activates this inactive form of enzyme into the active form, pepsin. Pepsin breaks down proteins into polypeptides.

====Mechanical digestion====
Within a few moments after food enters the stomach, mixing waves begin to occur at intervals of approximately 20 seconds. A mixing wave is a unique type of peristalsis that mixes and softens the food with gastric juices to create chyme. The initial mixing waves are relatively gentle, but these are followed by more intense waves, starting at the body of the stomach and increasing in force as they reach the pylorus. 

The pylorus, which holds around 30 mL of chyme, acts as a filter, permitting only liquids and small food particles to pass through the mostly, but not fully, closed pyloric sphincter. In a process called gastric emptying, rhythmic mixing waves force about 3 mL of chyme at a time through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum. Release of a greater amount of chyme at one time would overwhelm the capacity of the small intestine to handle it. The rest of the chyme is pushed back into the body of the stomach, where it continues mixing. This process is repeated when the next mixing waves force more chyme into the duodenum.

Gastric emptying is regulated by both the stomach and the duodenum. The presence of chyme in the duodenum activates receptors that inhibit gastric secretion. This prevents additional chyme from being released by the stomach before the duodenum is ready to process it.

====Chemical digestion====
The fundus stores both undigested food and gases that are released during the process of chemical digestion. Food may sit in the fundus of the stomach for a while before being mixed with the chyme. While the food is in the fundus, the digestive activities of salivary amylase continue until the food begins mixing with the acidic chyme. Ultimately, mixing waves incorporate this food with the chyme, the acidity of which inactivates salivary amylase and activates lingual lipase. Lingual lipase then begins breaking down triglycerides into free fatty acids, and mono- and diglycerides.

The breakdown of protein begins in the stomach through the actions of hydrochloric acid, and the enzyme pepsin.

The stomach can also produce gastric lipase, which can help digesting fat.

The contents of the stomach are completely emptied into the duodenum within two to four hours after the meal is eaten. Different types of food take different amounts of time to process. Foods heavy in carbohydrates empty fastest, followed by high-protein foods. Meals with a high triglyceride content remain in the stomach the longest. Since enzymes in the small intestine digest fats slowly, food can stay in the stomach for 6 hours or longer when the duodenum is processing fatty chyme. However, this is still a fraction of the 24 to 72 hours that full digestion typically takes from start to finish.

=== Absorption ===
Although the absorption in the human digestive system is mainly a function of the small intestine, some absorption of certain small molecules nevertheless does occur in the stomach through its lining. This includes:
* Water, if the body is dehydrated
* Medication, such as aspirin
* Amino acids
* 10–20% of ingested ethanol (e.g. from alcoholic beverages)
* Caffeine
* To a small extent water-soluble vitamins (most are absorbed in the small intestine)

The parietal cells of the human stomach are responsible for producing intrinsic factor, which is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. B12 is used in cellular metabolism and is necessary for the production of red blood cells, and the functioning of the nervous system.

=== Control of secretion and motility ===
Chyme from the stomach is slowly released into the duodenum through coordinated peristalsis and opening of the pyloric sphincter. The movement and the flow of chemicals into the stomach are controlled by both the autonomic nervous system and by the various digestive hormones of the digestive system:

Other than gastrin, these hormones all act to turn off the stomach action. This is in response to food products in the liver and gall bladder, which have not yet been absorbed. The stomach needs to push food into the small intestine only when the intestine is not busy. While the intestine is full and still digesting food, the stomach acts as storage for food.

===Other===
;Effects of EGF
Epidermal growth factor (EGF) results in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival. EGF is a low-molecular-weight polypeptide first purified from the mouse submandibular gland, but since then found in many human tissues including the submandibular gland, and the parotid gland. Salivary EGF, which also seems to be regulated by dietary inorganic iodine, also plays an important physiological role in the maintenance of oro-esophageal and gastric tissue integrity. The biological effects of salivary EGF include healing of oral and gastroesophageal ulcers, inhibition of gastric acid secretion, stimulation of DNA synthesis, and mucosal protection from intraluminal injurious factors such as gastric acid, bile acids, pepsin, and trypsin and from physical, chemical, and bacterial agents.

;Stomach as nutrition sensor
The human stomach has receptors responsive to sodium glutamate and this information is passed to the lateral hypothalamus and limbic system in the brain as a palatability signal through the vagus nerve. The stomach can also sense, independently of tongue and oral taste receptors, glucose, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. This allows the brain to link nutritional value of foods to their tastes.

;Thyrogastric syndrome 
This syndrome defines the association between thyroid disease and chronic gastritis, which was first described in the 1960s. This term was coined also to indicate the presence of thyroid autoantibodies or autoimmune thyroid disease in patients with pernicious anemia, a late clinical stage of atrophic gastritis. In 1993, a more complete investigation on the stomach and thyroid was published, reporting that the thyroid is, embryogenetically and phylogenetically, derived from a primitive stomach, and that the thyroid cells, such as primitive gastroenteric cells, migrated and specialized in uptake of iodide and in storage and elaboration of iodine compounds during vertebrate evolution. In fact, the stomach and thyroid share iodine-concentrating ability and many morphological and functional similarities, such as cell polarity and apical microvilli, similar organ-specific antigens and associated autoimmune diseases, secretion of glycoproteins (thyroglobulin and mucin) and peptide hormones, the digesting and readsorbing ability, and lastly, similar ability to form iodotyrosines by peroxidase activity, where iodide acts as an electron donor in the presence of H2O2. In the following years, many researchers published reviews about this syndrome.

==Clinical significance==

===Diseases===

A series of radiographs can be used to examine the stomach for various disorders. This will often include the use of a barium swallow. Another method of examination of the stomach, is the use of an endoscope. A gastric emptying study is considered the gold standard to assess the gastric emptying rate.

A large number of studies have indicated that most cases of peptic ulcers, and gastritis, in humans are caused by &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; infection, and an association has been seen with the development of stomach cancer.

A stomach rumble is actually noise from the intestines.

===Surgery===
In humans, many bariatric surgery procedures involve the stomach, in order to lose weight. A gastric band may be placed around the cardia area, which can adjust to limit intake. The anatomy of the stomach may be modified, or the stomach may be bypassed entirely.

Surgical removal of the stomach is called a gastrectomy, and removal of the cardia area is a called a cardiectomy. &quot;Cardiectomy&quot; is a term that is also used to describe the removal of the heart. A gastrectomy may be carried out because of gastric cancer or severe perforation of the stomach wall.

Fundoplication is stomach surgery in which the fundus is wrapped around the lower esophagus and stitched into place. It is used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

===Etymology===
The word &quot;stomach&quot; is derived from Greek &quot;stomachos&quot; (), ultimately from &quot;stoma&quot; () &#x27;mouth&#x27;. &quot;Gastro-&quot; and &quot;gastric&quot; (meaning &#x27;related to the stomach&#x27;) are both derived from Greek &quot;gaster&quot; () &#x27;belly&#x27;.

==Other animals==
Although the precise shape and size of the stomach varies widely among different vertebrates, the relative positions of the esophageal and duodenal openings remain relatively constant. As a result, the organ always curves somewhat to the left before curving back to meet the pyloric sphincter. However, lampreys, hagfishes, chimaeras, lungfishes, and some teleost fish have no stomach at all, with the esophagus opening directly into the intestine. These animals all consume diets that require little storage of food, no predigestion with gastric juices, or both.
The gastric lining is usually divided into two regions, an anterior portion lined by fundic glands and a posterior portion lined with pyloric glands. Cardiac glands are unique to mammals, and even then are absent in a number of species. The distributions of these glands vary between species, and do not always correspond with the same regions as in humans. Furthermore, in many non-human mammals, a portion of the stomach anterior to the cardiac glands is lined with epithelium essentially identical to that of the esophagus. Ruminants, in particular, have a complex four-chambered stomach. The first three chambers (rumen, reticulum, and omasum) are all lined with esophageal mucosa, while the final chamber functions like a monogastric stomach, which is called the abomasum.

In birds and crocodilians, the stomach is divided into two regions. Anteriorly is a narrow tubular region, the proventriculus, lined by fundic glands, and connecting the true stomach to the crop. Beyond lies the powerful muscular gizzard, lined by pyloric glands, and, in some species, containing stones that the animal swallows to help grind up food.

In insects, there is also a crop. The insect stomach is called the midgut.

Information about the stomach in echinoderms or molluscs can be found under the respective articles.

<text>A marching band is a group of instrumental musicians who play while marching. Historically they were used in armed forces and many marching bands remain military bands. Others are still associated with military units or emulate a military style, with elements such as uniforms, flags and batons and occasionally rifles or sabers. Instrumentation typically includes brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments. 

Marching bands are generally categorised by affiliation, function, size and instrumentation. In addition to traditional military parades, marching bands are frequently seen at events as varied as carnivals, parades, sporting events, trade union events and marching band competitions.

==History==

Instruments have been frequently used on the battlefield (for example the Iron Age carnyx and the medieval Ottoman military band) but the modern marching band developed from European military bands formed in the Baroque period, partly influenced by the Ottoman tradition. 
17th-century traveler Evliya Çelebi noted the existence of 40 guilds of musicians in Istanbul. 
In the 18th century, each regiment in the British Army maintained its own military band. Until 1749 bandsmen were civilians hired at the expense of the colonel commanding a regiment. Subsequently, they became regular enlisted men who accompanied the unit on active service to provide morale enhancing music on the battlefield or, from the late nineteenth century on, to act as stretcher bearers. Instruments during the 18th century included fifes, drums, the oboe (hautbois), French horn, clarinet and bassoon. Drummers summoned men from their farms and ranches to muster for duty. In the chaotic environment of the battlefield, musical instruments were the only means of commanding the men to advance, stand or retire. In the mid 19th century, each smaller unit had their own fifer and drummer, who sounded the daily routine. When units massed for battle a band of musicians was formed for the whole.

In the United States, modern marching bands are often associated with American football games, with the oldest (the University of Notre Dame Band of the Fighting Irish) first performing at an American football game in 1887. After World War I, the presence and quality of marching bands in the American public school system expanded as military veterans with service band experience began to accept music teaching positions within schools with developments such as Precision Drill, a disciplined geometric march, based in part on military-style drill. Today, marching band competitions remain popular in the United States and largely parallel modern drum and bugle corps.

Many marching bands are Military bands which often derive from instrumentation generally consists of brass, woodwinds and percussion and they typically march forward with consistent straight lines and a constant tempo to facilitate the steady marching of the military unit. Field music units include drum and bugle corps, fanfare bands, pipe bands and fife and drum corps.

Military styled marching bands are present in many European countries due to its historical origins in 18th Century European field armies and are present in many other nations due to colonial influence, including Latin America and South America, South and South-East Asia and the Commonwealth (for example Fiji&#x27;s Military Forces) and many ex-Soviet nations (with the USSR inheriting the tradition from the Kingdom of Russia).

Many bands perform a wide selection of both traditional styles of music such as marches, with film scores, or adaptations of contemporary music. The goal of each band&#x27;s performance is different. Some aim for maximum uniformity and precision; others aim to be as entertaining as possible. Some show bands also involve comedic elements, such as Scramble bands which generally do not march in time with the music, but, as their name implies, scramble from design to design.

Many bands have auxiliaries that add a visual component to the performance such as a color guard or even dance lines and majorettes. In the USA, these auxiliaries may even perform as independent groups (such as winter guard). While military color guards were typically male, band color guards tend to be primarily female, though for both, mixed groups are becoming more common. 

A marching band is typically led by one or more drum majors, also called field commanders, who are usually responsible for conducting the band (sometimes using a large baton or mace) and are commonly referred to as the leader of the band. Commands—such as vocal orders, clapping, or a whistle—may be used to issue commands as well.

==Show Band Performance elements==

The following overview is heavily focused on the U.S. marching band tradition.

=== Marching technique ===

====Glide step====

The glide step, also commonly known as the &quot;roll step,&quot; involves bringing the heel gently to the ground with the toe pointed up, and then rolling forward onto the toes before lifting the foot to continue forward. While marching to the rear, the weight is placed continually on the ball of the foot with the heel elevated. This style is used by both marching bands as well as drum and bugle corps. The style, in comparison to high step, gives drill formations a more fluid appearance, allowing for better control of more difficult formations and various styles of music. With this control also comes the ability to perform a much broader range of tempos. Proper execution of a roll step gives a player marching at 40 beats per minute the same smooth tone as a player marching at 180. The roll step allows for much better control of the upper body, and thus better control of the air support needed for playing.

Some bands, and a select few drum and bugle corps, use a bent-knee variant of roll step, usually known simply as &quot;bent knee,&quot; in which the members roll from heel to toe but lead the next step with the knee instead of the foot, then planting the heel of the next foot by straightening the leg.

====High step====

The high step is a style of marching used by many colleges and universities, including most bands of HBCUs and the Big Ten. Four primary sub-variants of the high are used:

* The &quot;ankle-knee&quot; step involves bringing the foot up to the inside of the leg to the knee before coming down and forward. This is the style used by most bands from HBCUs.
* The &quot;chair step&quot; involves lifting the knee until the thighs are parallel to the ground, and with toes pointed downward. When the leg is elevated to its maximum height, a ninety-degree angle exists between the torso and the thigh, as well as between the thigh and shin. The leg is then lowered, and this is repeated in an alternating fashion between the legs. This style is used by many schools in the Big Ten.
* The &quot;extended high step&quot;, much like the chair step, involves the thigh being parallel to the ground and perpendicular to the body, but instead with the shin extended outward at a forty-five-degree angle from the body and with toes pointed downward. The leg is then driven quickly back to the ground while the other leg repeats in this fashion.
* The &quot;stop-at-the-top&quot; is a style similar to the chair step and is currently used only at the University of Wisconsin Marching Band. It involves bringing the leg up so that the thigh is at a 45-degree angle with the ground with the toes pointed as far down as possible. While the chair step is almost always used as merely a special decorative step, stop-at-the-top is the Wisconsin band&#x27;s default marching style.

An integral part of this style of marching is known as &quot;stop action,&quot; meaning that all movement ceases momentarily at the apex of each step. This requires a band to have a great deal of stamina, though is effective visually. High step marching is often accompanied by a horizontal swing of the player&#x27;s body or instrument.

====Lateral marching====

When band members are marching in one direction but want to focus their sound on another, they may rotate their bodies at the waist, so that only the upper portion of the body faces in the direction of play. This is known as &quot;lateral marching&quot;, but is more commonly known as either &quot;shifting&quot;, &quot;traversing&quot;, or &quot;sliding&quot;. A lateral march is not a change in the direction of march, only in the direction the upper body faces. Percussion players, whose large drum harnesses often prevent them from twisting their torsos, and sometimes tuba and sousaphone players, instead uses a &quot;crab step&quot; when moving sideways. During a crab step, the musician crosses one leg over the other, either marching on the toes or rolling the foot sideways. Percussionists may also substitute roll step when their instruments would interfere with performing the high step.

====Changing direction====

A true direction change involving the feet moving in a new direction requires either a &quot;prep step&quot; or a &quot;pivot&quot;, both of which are sometimes referred to as a &quot;flank&quot; or “stab”. To perform a prep step, on the last count of movement in the first direction a marcher plants the foot with the heel turned outward at half the angle of the turn desired, with the upper body still facing forward. On the next count, the other foot snaps into position completing the turn. The upper body may or may not turn with the lower body. Some bands plant the heel on the prep step rather than the toe but preserving the angle of the foot. To perform a pivot, the marcher pivots between directions over the ball of the foot on the last count instead of using a prep step.

====Backward marching====

A &quot;back march&quot; may be used when the band wishes to move in the opposite direction from where it is projecting its sound. There are several ways to back march, one of which is to walk backward, putting each foot down and rolling from the toe to the heel (the exact reverse of the roll step). Another variation involves marching on the platforms of the feet, dragging the toe of the moving foot on the ground. Backward marching usually employs the same preference for leg straightness as forward marching (if the band marches with legs completely straight while marching forwards, they also do so while marching backward, to preserve uniformity of style). Using peripheral vision to align oneself to formations or field markings is even more important during backward marching.

====Marking time====

When a band is not moving, the members may &quot;mark time&quot;, or march in place. The step used usually resembles the step that is used for marching forward, though mixing a high step mark time with a roll step march (or vice versa) produces an interesting visual effect. For a typical mark time, the foot is raised to the ankle bone of the opposite leg. The toe should not come off the ground and the knee should not come out much past the still-straight leg.

Some bands mark time by bringing their feet up to their knee—known as &quot;high-mark time&quot;. Some bands practice marking time during concert arch with the toes coming off of the ground to give the marcher a greater sense of marching while standing still. The heel should hit the ground on the beat. Traditionally, the drumline would put their feet in a V-shape and lift either foot fully off the ground a few inches while marking time. This is to avoid hitting the drums with their legs. Additionally, some bands forgo marking time and instead come to a complete halt when not marching.

====Staying in step====
Even when marking time, it is considered good form for all band members to stay &quot;in step&quot;—that is, step with the same foot at the same time. A large majority of bands &quot;step off&quot; with, or start marching on, the left foot. Staying in step is generally easier when the band is playing music or when the drums are playing a marching cadence.

When the band and percussion are not playing, rhythm may be maintained in a variety of ways: a drummer may play taps or rim shots, the drum major may clap or use a woodblock, a drum major or band member may vocalize a sharp syllable like &quot;hit,&quot; &quot;hut,&quot; or &quot;dut,&quot; or band members may chant the military call of &quot;left, left, left right left.&quot; Band members may count the steps of the move out loud to keep the entire band together. Typically, most moves consist of any number of steps that are a multiples of two or four, due to most marching band music being in even numbered time signatures. Even-numbered time signatures aid in staying in step because they assign odd-numbered counts to the left foot, and even-numbered counts to the right foot. If a band member is on the wrong foot, for instance, odd on the right foot and even on the left, this is referred to as being &quot;out of step&quot;. When a band member is completely off tempo, it is referred to as being &quot;out of phase&quot;.

===Parade marching===

In parades, bands usually line up in a marching block composed of ranks and files. Each member tries to stay within his or her given rank and file, and to maintain even spacing with neighboring musicians. It is traditionally the responsibility of the people at the end of each rank and the front of each file to be in the correct location; this allows other band members to use them as a reference, also known as &quot;guiding&quot;.

Band members also try to keep a constant pace or step size while marching in parade. Step sizes usually vary between 22 and 30 inches (56–76 cm) per stride. A step size of 22.5 inches is called an &quot;8-to-5&quot; step because the marcher covers five yards (about 4.6 m) in eight steps. A step size of 30 inches is called &quot;6-to-5&quot; because five yards are covered in six steps. Because yard lines on an American football field are five yards apart, exact 8-to-5 and 6-to-5 steps are most useful for field shows.

A drum cadence, sometimes called a &quot;walk beat&quot; or &quot;street beat,&quot; is usually played when the band is marching, oftentimes alternating with a song, and is typically how a band keeps time while not playing music. Alternatively, a drum or rim shot may be given on the odd beats to keep the band in step. Between songs and cadences, a roll is usually given to indicate what beat in the measure the band is at. Cadence tempo varies from group to group.

===Field marching===
While playing music during a field show, the band makes a series of formations, called drill, on the field, which may be pictures, geometric shapes, curvilinear designs, or blocks of musicians, although sometimes it may be pure abstract designs using no specific form.

Typically, each band member has an assigned position in each formation. In many show bands and most drum corps, these positions are illustrated in a handheld booklet called a drill book (also known as a dot book). Drill books, or drill charts, show where each person stands during each set of the show. The drill charts include yard lines and hashes as they would be on an actual football field, which shows the band members where to stand relative to the yard lines and hashes. There are many ways of getting from one formation to the next:
* Each member moves independently called &quot;scattering&quot; or &quot;scatter drill.&quot;
* All members move together without deforming the formation—called &quot;floating.&quot;
* Members stay in their lines and arcs, but slowly deform the formation—sometimes called &quot;rotating,&quot; &quot;expanding,&quot; or &quot;condensing.&quot;
* Members break into ranks or squads, each of which performs a maneuver (such as a &quot;follow-the-leader&quot;) which may or may not be scripted. An unscripted move is sometimes called a &quot;rank option.&quot;
* Each member performs a specifically scripted move. In these cases, the desired visual effect is often the move itself and not the ending formation.
* Members at an extended halt perform a stationary visual move, such as a ripple (like &quot;the wave&quot;) or some sort of choreography, that may propagate throughout the formation of band members.

Players may point the bells of their instruments in the direction they are moving, or &quot;slide&quot; (also called traverse) with all the bells facing in the same direction. They may also point it towards the center of the field. Bands that march in time with the music typically also synchronize the direction of individuals&#x27; turns and try to maintain even spacing between individuals in formations (called intervals). Sometimes bands specifically have wind players turn their instruments away from the audience to emphasize the dynamics of the music.

Auxiliaries can also add to the visual effect. Backdrops and props (&quot;scrims&quot;) may be used on the field that fit the theme of the show or the music being performed. In comedic shows, particularly for university bands, an announcer may read jokes or a funny script between songs; formations that are words or pictures (or the songs themselves) may serve as punch lines.
Each musician in a marching band creates sound waves. The waves from each musician, traveling at the speed of sound, reach the other musicians, field conductors, and listeners at slightly different times. If the distance between musicians is large enough, listeners may perceive waves to be . Typically, in this case, listeners perceive that one section of the band is playing their parts slightly after another section. This &quot;delay&quot; effect is informally referred to as &quot;ensemble tear&quot; or &quot;phasing&quot; (not to be confused with the music composition technique of the same name).

=== United States ===
Many marching bands serve as entertainment during American football games, which may also be known as pep band. For college and high school marching bands, this is the primary purpose of the ensemble. Three National Football League teams designate an official marching band: the Washington Commanders, Buffalo Bills and Baltimore Ravens. Marching bands are otherwise uncommon at the professional level.

Nearly all marching band personnel wear some kind of uniform. Military-style uniforms are most common, but there are bands that use everything from matching T-shirts and shorts to formal wear. The school or organization&#x27;s name, symbol, or colors are commonly applied to uniforms. Uniforms may also have substantially different colors on the front and back, so if band members turn suddenly (&quot;flank&quot;), the audience sees a striking change of color. Band members at many Ivy League schools wear a jacket and tie while performing. The Southern Methodist University band wear a different combination of jackets, vests, ties, shirts, and pants for each half (changing before halftime) of each game and no clothing or uniform combinations are repeated during the marching season. The Alma College Kiltie Marching Band is famous for wearing kilts made of the official Alma College tartan.

The components of a band uniform are numerous. Common design elements include hats (typically shakos, pith helmets, combination hats or other styles of helmets) with feather plumes, capes, gloves, rank cords, and other embellishments. The USC Spirit of Troy Marching Band and Troy University&#x27;s Sound of the South Marching Band wear traditional Trojan helmets. It is also common for band uniforms to have a stripe down the leg and light-colored shoes, or spats over dark shoes to emphasize the movement of the legs while marching. Similarly, uniforms may feature additional components which highlight movement of the upper body, such as the &quot;wings&quot; worn by the University of Minnesota&#x27;s marching band to highlight flanking movements on the field. Competitive bands, however, many times opt for matching uniforms, especially pants and shoes (usually white or black) to hide the visual effect of members who are out of step as seen from a distance. Occasionally, a band forgoes traditional uniforms in favor of costumes that fit the theme of its field show. The costumes may or may not be uniform throughout the band. This kind of specialized uniform change is usually confined to competitive marching bands.

Drum Majors, the field commanders and band directors, usually do not wear the regular band uniform, to better distinguish them from the rest of the band. Some wear more formal outfits or costumes that match the theme of the music, or most commonly a differently designed version of the regular band uniform, often employing different colors (especially white) or features such as capes. Some (especially at the college level) still employ the tall wool-lined shako or much larger bearskin (both often derisively referred to as a &quot;Q-Tip hat&quot;). Sousaphone players may use a military-style beret or entirely forgo the use of a head covering, as most hats may be in the way of the bell. Some auxiliary groups use uniforms that resemble gymnastics outfits: Often, these uniforms are themed, drawing inspiration from the music. Many auxiliary groups change the outfits they use from season to season based on the needs of the band, although some that do also have a &quot;base&quot; uniform for occasions such as parades or other ceremonies.
Bands may compete on criteria such as musicality, uniformity, visual impact, artistic interpretation, and the difficulty of the music and drill. Competition exists at all levels but is most common in the U.S. among secondary school bands and drum and bugle corps. Competitions at the national level, such as the Bands of America (BOA) Grand National Championships.

Although its legitimacy is often called into question, competitive marching band is sometimes considered a sport, due in large part to the physical exertion required in combination with teamwork. Many HBCU marching band fans refer to marching band as &quot;marching sport.&quot; Sports Illustrated considered the activity a sport in 1987, describing the Drum Corps International World Championships “one of the biggest sporting events of the summer.” In the same article, Sports Illustrated quoted basketball coach Bobby Knight, &quot;If a basketball team trained as hard as these kids do, it would be unbelievable. I like to take my players [to watch drum corps] to show them what they can accomplish with hard work and teamwork. Besides, once they see them practice 12 hours a day, my players think I’m a helluva lot easier.”

In his presentation to the American College of Sports Medicine&#x27;s annual meeting in 2009, researcher and exercise physiologist Gary Granata presented research after studying members of the Avon High School Marching Black and Gold, noting &quot;At the top levels of marching band and drum corps, you get a level of competition and athleticism that is equal to a Division I athletic program.&quot; Granata further pointed out, &quot;Performers are constantly moving, and often running, at velocities that reach 180 steps or more per minute while playing instruments that weigh up to 40 pounds.&quot;

Performers’ metabolic rates matched those of marathon runners halfway through a marathon, while the heart rate was more along the lines of someone who was running a &quot;400 or 800-meter dash.&quot;

Performance styles range from traditional block marching to elaborate productions with evolving drill patterns.

WAMSB (World Association of Marching Show Bands) is an international organization holding many competitions throughout the world. Its World Championships are held annually in the summer in a different country. Past host nations include Canada, Brazil, Japan, Malaysia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, &amp; Australia. WAMSB sanctioned events happen in 32 nations.

In the United States, there are two national competition circuits in which bands can compete: Bands of America and the United States Scholastic Band Association (USSBA, more commonly referred to as USBands), involving over 700 high school bands compete during the Fall season with bands of similar size and talent. Each competition provides approximately 40 professional judges who give feedback on the show&#x27;s programming and design. At the season&#x27;s end, the top 50 bands are invited to compete in the US Scholastic Band Championship, which is hosted at a college or professional stadium.

Bill Clinton, 42nd President of the United States, was a member of a marching band in high school. He attended Hot Springs High School in Arkansas and performed as a saxophone player while later serving as drum major for the band. He is the only U.S. President to have been a member of a marching band.

===Canada===

Most marching bands in Canada are organized by the Canadian Band Association or by Canadian universities:

*Royal Military College of Canada Bands
*Simon Fraser University Pipe Band 
*Western Mustang Band 

Although many bands have still retained the British tradition for marching bands, most have also adopted the style utilized by their American counterparts. Canadian military bands are often associated with civilian marching bands. Many of the civilian marching bands that exist today, such as the Oshawa Civic Band, The Concert Band of Cobourg and the Toronto Signals Band, have military roots and were formerly Canadian Army bands. In the case of the aforementioned bands, their lineage is shared with the bands of The Ontario Regiment, the 6th Northumberland Militia and the 2nd Armoured Divisional Signals Regiment respectively. In the early to mid-20th century, the Canadian Forces maintained drum and bugle corps, which were similar in instrumentation and organization to civilian marching bands.

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan, the National Marching Band Association is the main organizer of local marching bands in the country. It is currently located at its headquarters in the Neihu District of Taipei City. The Taipei First Girls&#x27; High School currently sports one of the most acclaimed marching bands in the country.

===Malaysia===
The first marching bands were introduced in Malaysia during the British colonial period and has since grown and increased its importance. The most common are found in the Malaysian Armed Forces, however, in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of show bands and drum corps in the country. Although the Ministry of Education organizes most school marching bands, other organizations have made consistent efforts to organize local marching bands.

===Russia===
In Russia, there are not many school or local marching bands in existence, with most being government-sponsored military and police bands, as well as several bands operated by the local governments. The marching bands of the Russian Armed Forces are organized by the Military Band Service in the Ministry of Defence. Also known as &quot;Marshiruyushchiye orkestr&quot; (loosely translated to Марширующие оркестр, which means Marching Orchestra in Russian), notable Russian marching bands include the Band and Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College, whose cadets are famous for setting the pace for the annual Victory Day Parades on Red Square. These types of bands only came into existence after 1991 when the Soviet Union ceased to exist. During the Soviet era, civilian like marching bands were extremely rare, with one of the only non-military bands having been employed in the late 1930s and early 1940s during National Sports Day parades in the capital of Moscow. Other Russian marching bands include the Drummers Group of the Boarding School for Girls of the Ministry of Defense of Russia and the Moscow &amp; District Pipe Band. The country has hosted many marching band tattoos within the last 70 years, including the Spasskaya Tower Military Music Festival and Tattoo in Moscow and the Amur Waves International Military Bands Festival in Khabarovsk.

=== Singapore ===
The traditions of both the Singapore Police Force Band and the Singapore Armed Forces Bands soon inspired the creation of the Singaporean marching band tradition. By the 1960s, school and college marching bands, corps of drums and drum and bugle corps began to be commonplace (the latter in cadet units), as well as bands of youth uniformed organizations and universities, all following the armed forces pattern and British and Malayan (later Malaysian) precedence. The People&#x27;s Association became the first civilian organization to form a dedicated marching band in 1965-66, and the Ministry of Education followed suit with a teachers&#x27; band made up of band instructors. Today the Ministry of Education is responsible for overall control over the school, college, university and polytechnic bands within Singapore, with two dedicated cadet bands.

Some of Singapore&#x27;s oldest high school marching bands are from the Raffles&#x27; Institution, St. Joseph&#x27;s Institution, Victoria School, Bukit Panjang Government HS and the Anglo-Chinese School.

The SPF has the country&#x27;s three uniformed pipe bands, the Women&#x27;s Police, SPF and Gurkha Contingent Pipe Bands, all raised in the late 1960s. Civilian pipe bands were formerly present in the PA, Boys Brigade and the Port of Singapore Authority.

<text>Cartoon Network Studios Inc. (abbreviated as CNS) is an American animation studio owned by the Warner Bros. Television Group division of Warner Bros. Entertainment, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery. The studio is the production arm of Cartoon Network, and was founded in 1994 as a division of Hanna-Barbera.

The studio primarily produces and develops animated programs and shorts for Cartoon Network and Cartoonito, and has also developed properties for Adult Swim and Max. The studio has produced dozens of shows, including &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; (and its film adaptation), &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, &quot;Time Squad&quot;, &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;, &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot;, &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot;, &quot;Camp Lazlo&quot;, &quot;Ben 10&quot;, &quot;Chowder&quot;, &quot;The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack&quot;, &quot;Adventure Time&quot;, &quot;Generator Rex,&quot; &quot;Regular Show&quot;, &quot;Steven Universe&quot;, &quot;Clarence&quot;, &quot;We Bare Bears&quot;, &quot;OK K.O.! Let&#x27;s Be Heroes&quot;, &quot;Craig of the Creek&quot;, and &quot;Infinity Train&quot;.

In 1996, Time Warner (now Warner Bros. Discovery) acquired Turner Broadcasting System, which owned Cartoon Network and Hanna-Barbera at that time. In 1997, Hanna-Barbera consolidated its operations with Warner Bros. Animation, moving into their facilities in 1998, where Cartoon Network Studios also operated briefly. Hanna-Barbera closed permanently in 2001, and Warner Bros. Animation has managed its intellectual property to this day, occasionally using the Hanna-Barbera brand as a label.

In 1999, Cartoon Network acquired a large building in Burbank, California, to serve as the headquarters for Cartoon Network Studios after its effective separation from Hanna-Barbera and Warner Bros. Animation. This was due to the need for Cartoon Network Studios to become an independent entity dedicated to creating original series, while Warner Bros. Animation focused on existing IPs. The studio opened on May 22, 2000, and operated in those facilities for over 20 years.

In the 2020s, after multiple corporate mergers, the studio was consolidated into Warner Bros. Animation, and continued to operate as a separate division, although it was relocated to Second Century Development as the company&#x27;s new headquarters on August 1, 2023. Sam Register, the president of both studios in Burbank, California, also leads Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe (formerly Cartoon Network Studios Europe) in London, England, alongside Vanessa Brookman.

== History ==
=== 1990s ===
In the 20th century, animation as a medium became popular on television. Hanna-Barbera became the premier studio for small-screen animated programs, launching a dominant series of Saturday-morning fare, including &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, and more. By the 1980s, cable television was developed, with businessman Ted Turner one of its pioneers. Turner founded several cable channels and also acquired vast film libraries, and in 1991 his company signed a joint deal to buy Hanna-Barbera. The Cartoon Network was developed as a cable outlet to air these animated properties, which largely consisted of H-B reruns. As the channel grew in subscribers, executives at the Atlanta-based company sought out original programming to supplement its catalog. Other animation-heavy cable channels, including Nickelodeon and Disney Channel, founded their own in-house studios throughout the decade as well.

Cartoon Network Studios originated in 1994 as a division of Hanna-Barbera that focused on producing original programming for Cartoon Network. Hanna-Barbera had been located on Cahuenga Boulevard in Los Angeles since 1963, and housed the studio, its archives, and its extensive animation art collection. Its first productions included &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; (1995), an anthology series of short subjects serving as pilots for new CN programs. The first of these, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, launched in 1996 and was an immediate success. The same year, Turner Broadcasting System was merged with Time Warner, and Hanna-Barbera closed its Cahuenga campus, relocating to Sherman Oaks Galleria in nearby Sherman Oaks, where Warner Bros. Animation was located. Over the course of this transition, the Cartoon Network Studios branding was briefly phased out, with newer programs, including &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; (1998), opting for H-B branding.

=== 2000s ===

On July 21, 1999, Cartoon Network officially started the studio to separate itself from the complete folding of Hanna-Barbera into WBA. Following the death of the studio&#x27;s co-founder William Hanna in 2001, Cartoon Network Studios took over the animation function of Hanna-Barbera. The network acquired a three-story 43,000-square-foot facility located at 300 N 3rd St. in Burbank, California to house its new offices, previously a commercial bakery, and prior to that, the location of a Pacific Bell telephone exchange. According to Cartoon Brew, the network spent around $1.2 million to renovate the building. The network took counsel from its top cartoonists, Genndy Tartakovsky and Craig McCracken, on the site of its new studio, as well as design proposals for its offices.

In March 2000, the network began to transfer its production offices, and on May 22, 2000, the studio was christened by veteran animator and animation advisor Joseph Barbera with a bottle of champagne. The building&#x27;s official opening came on August 24, 2000; former DiC and Nickelodeon employees Brian A. Miller and Jennifer Pelphrey were hired to manage the studio. Mike Lazzo, then head of programming and development, designed a pirate flag, with a skull bearing the channel logo in its teeth, that flew over the building for several weeks before local police threatened action over its lack of permit. Its artists quickly took to its stairwell with doodles and other graffiti that filled over its twenty-year history; it was also home to a mural by artist Ian Anderson titled &quot;Mazeway to Heaven&quot;. The first new productions at the new offices included &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; and &quot;Time Squad&quot; (both 2001). In 2001, Lazzo called the studio &quot;the Termite Terrace of today.&quot;

In 2002, the studio produced two television pilots for Cartoon Network&#x27;s late night programming block Adult Swim: &quot;Welcome to Eltingville&quot; and &quot;The Groovenians&quot;, neither of which were picked as full series. Also, the studio released this year its only theatrical film to date: &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot;, based on &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, which received positive reviews from critics but performed poorly at the box office. In 2006, CNS collaborated with sister studio Williams Street for the first time for &quot;Korgoth of Barbaria&quot;, a television pilot made for Adult Swim, which was also not green-lit as a series.

In 2007, CNS began its first foray into live-action with the hybrid series &quot;Out of Jimmy&#x27;s Head&quot;, and then its first fully live-action project, &quot;Ben 10: Race Against Time&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Ben 10: Alien Swarm&quot;, along with the television pilots &quot;Locker 514&quot;, &quot;Siblings&quot; and &quot;Stan the Man&quot;. The studio&#x27;s first live-action series &quot;Tower Prep&quot; would arrive in 2010. Former New Line Television producer Mark Costa was hired to oversee the projects and CNS&#x27; live-action production company Alive and Kicking, Inc.. &quot;Incredible Crew&quot; was the last series in that genre the studio produced for Cartoon Network. Despite the failure of live-action on the channel, the studio&#x27;s infrastructure was retained to produce live-action fare for sibling programming block Adult Swim, identifying on-air as Alive and Kicking, along with two other companies (Rent Now Productions and Factual Productions), instead of using the Cartoon Network Studios banner.

=== 2010s ===

On April 5, 2010, &quot;Adventure Time&quot; premiered on Cartoon Network; the same series began life as a short featured on Nicktoons&#x27; &quot;Random! Cartoons&quot; that was ultimately not green-lit as a series by that channel. Cartoon Network picked it up later, and production of the show moved to CNS. The series lasted until 2018 with 10 seasons and 283 episodes. A film was announced in 2015, but in 2018 Adam Muto said that the film was never officially announced. In 2019, a continuation, titled &quot;Adventure Time: Distant Lands&quot;, was announced for HBO Max with a release in 2020. Also this year, &quot;The Cartoonstitute&quot;, an incubator series similar to &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot;, debuted on Cartoon Network Video. The pilots of &quot;Regular Show&quot; and &quot;Uncle Grandpa&quot; were presented here along with other shorts, with the &quot;Uncle Grandpa&quot; pilot also serving as a basis for &quot;Secret Mountain Fort Awesome&quot;, which preceded the actual series.
In 2014, CNS produced its first miniseries, &quot;Over the Garden Wall&quot;. The following year, &quot;Long Live the Royals&quot; was also premiered. In 2016, the studio produced two reboots based on &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; and &quot;Ben 10&quot; respectively. Also, the studio produced its first television series based on a series of online shorts, &quot;Mighty Magiswords&quot;.

In 2017, after plans as old as 2002 for a film didn&#x27;t work, &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; was revived for a fifth and final season, which the studio returned to produce for Adult Swim, to critical acclaim, concluding the series after its cancellation from Cartoon Network in 2004. Also this year, it was announced that CNS, in collaboration with Studio T, would produce the adult animated series &quot;Close Enough&quot; for TBS, created by &quot;Regular Show&quot; creator J. G. Quintel.

In 2019, after handling a few episodes of &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;, the second season of &quot;Black Dynamite&quot;, the above-mentioned fifth season of &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; and producing the above-mentioned television pilots &quot;Welcome to Eltingville&quot;, &quot;The Groovenians&quot; and &quot;Korgoth of Barbaria&quot;, CNS produced its first full program for Adult Swim: &quot;Primal&quot;, an adult animated series from Genndy Tartakovsky. The first five episodes were also packaged for a limited theatrical release as a feature film titled &quot;Primal: Tales of Savagery&quot;.

CNS also began to produce content for parent company WarnerMedia&#x27;s upcoming streaming service HBO Max, including &quot;Adventure Time: Distant Lands.&quot; After the failure of its planned animation block, &quot;Close Enough&quot; was also shifted from TBS to HBO Max.

In the 2010s, the studio began to outgrow its original building, and began to rent space in other facilities in the Burbank Media Center district.

=== 2020s ===
In August 2020, WBA president Sam Register was appointed head of the studio. Amy Friedman was named head of programming for Cartoon Network after Rob Sorcher resigned his roles as head of the studio and chief content officer, and switching to Warner Bros. Television Group for an overall production deal.

In 2021, Jason DeMarco was named SVP for Anime &amp; Action Series/Longform for Warner Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network Studios, and CNS Europe was renamed Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe as a tribute to the original Hanna-Barbera studio.

On May 11, 2022, after Tom Ascheim exited his role as president and departed, the Warner Bros. Global Kids, Young Adults and Classics division was broken up as part of a restructuring by new owner Warner Bros. Discovery and its studios—including CNS—were moved directly under Warner Bros. Television.

On October 11, 2022, CNS and WBA consolidated their development and production teams as part of a restructuring by Warner Bros. Television, with Audrey Diehl overseeing kids and family, Peter Girardi overseeing adult animation, and Sammy Perlmutter overseeing animated long-form productions. The merger would not impact their output as labels, with CNS continuing to focus on original content and WBA used for classic franchises.

On July 9, 2023, Miller announced via Twitter that the Cartoon Network Studios Burbank building would close its doors on August 1, with all operations being transferred to WBA as both CNS and WBA would be moving to the new Warner Bros. Second Century building. While unconfirmed, Amid Amidi of Cartoon Brew reported its production teams would move to the Second Century Development, a pair of buildings with over 800,000 square feet of office space, just adjacent to the Warner Bros. lot.

On December 5, it was revealed that the Hollywood Production Center had moved into the CN Burbank building. Brian A. Miller revealed that HPC has always owned the building, and Cartoon Network had a long-term lease.

<text>In military organizations, a colour guard (or color guard) is a detachment of soldiers assigned to the protection of regimental colours and the national flag. This duty is highly prestigious, and the military colour is generally carried by a young officer (ensign), while experienced non-commissioned officers (colour sergeants) are assigned to the protection of the national flag. These non-commissioned officers, accompanied in several countries by warrant officers, can be ceremonially armed with either sabres or rifles to protect the colour. Colour guards are generally dismounted, but there are also mounted colour guard formations as well.

==History==
As long as armies existed there was a need for soldiers to know where their comrades were. A solution to this problem was the carrying of colourful banners or other insignia. Such flags or banners either showed a personal symbol of the leader of said units or a symbol for the &quot;state&quot; they represented. 

Such banners or flags also came to represent a units identity and history. They were therefore treated with reverence as they represented the honour and traditions of the regiment. The loss of a unit&#x27;s flag was shameful, and losing that central point of reference could also make the unit break up. Therefore, regiments tended to adopt colour guards, a detachment of experienced or élite soldiers, to protect their colours. As a result, the capture of an enemy&#x27;s standard was considered as a great feat of arms.

Regimental flags were sometimes awarded to a regiment by a head of state during a ceremony, which was considered a high honour usually reserved for elite units, and colours may be inscribed with battle honours or other symbols representing former achievements.

Due to the advent of modern weapons, and subsequent changes in tactics, colours are no longer used in battle but continue to be carried by colour guards at events of formal character.

==By country==
=== Argentina===
In the Argentinean Armed Forces, the Color Guard is composed by a junior officer (normally the most junior in the unit) carrying the colors, accompanied by two senior NCOs with rifles, who provide the escort. The group is followed by a senior NCO carrying the regimental standard, with two junior NCOs (sometimes, privates) as escorts.
In academies and schools, the colors are carried by the student of the senior class with the highest marks, escorted by the two who follow him.
=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===

In the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army, the colour guards include one ensign holding the flag of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army as the national colour domestically or the flag of China when abroad, and two officers or senior NCOs assisting the ensign holding rifles.

In the parades of the 1950s, this configuration was present in every unit of the PLA up to the parade of 1959, but with the ensign and escorts drawn from individual formations. Today, only honour guards are granted colour guard duty to represent the whole of the PLA. Being the senior-most branch of the PLA, the Ground Forces representative serves as the ensign in the service colour guard, with the officer to his/her right being from the Navy and the officer to their left being from the Air Force. Since 1981, the PLA has continued a tradition of the colour guard detail with the PLA flag leading the Beijing Garrison Honor Guard Battalion in military parades. In December 2017, the Beijing Garrison Colour Guard Company of the People&#x27;s Armed Police, which is present during flag ceremonies in Tienanmen Square in Beijing carrying the national flag, was officially attached to the honour guard battalion. Its colour guard squad follows the same format as the guard of honor colour guard squad.

=== Taiwan (Republic of China) ===
In Taiwan, the colour guard tradition of the Republic of China Armed Forces is modeled on the German, Russian and US practice. Until 1976, each military unit sported a singular stand of colours on parade, as opposed to the honour guard of the ROCAF, which is more aligned with the traditions of the US Joint Service Honour Guard of the Joint Force Headquarters National Capital Region. All colour bearers of formations above company level must be, following US tradition, holding the rank of sergeant or above as a non-commissioned officer, while the colour escorts are lower ranking enlisted personnel. All wear full dress, service dress or battle dress uniforms. Since the National Day parade of 1978, the format of unit colour guards in ROCAF formations of battalion size (and of equivalent formations) is:

* Left escort
* 1st 2 company guidon bearers
* Unit colour
* 2nd 2 company guidon bearers 
* Right escort

Brigade-level colours (and above) are guided by the left and right escorts only.

The joint service colour guard of the ROCAF General Headquarters, today as in the past, is similarly composed but is more larger, with its composition being

* Left escort
* Air Force Flag
* Naval Jack
* Army Flag
* Flag of the Republic of China (National Colour)
* Army Honour Guard Unit Colour
* Navy Honour Guard Unit Colour
* Air Force Honour Guard Unit Colour
* Right escort

===Commonwealth of Nations===

Colour guards are used in the military throughout the Commonwealth of Nations, including Australia, Canada, Jamaica, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. A colour guard unit typically consists of the standard-bearer, who is of the rank of second lieutenant or equivalent (pilot officer or sub-lieutenant), positioned in the centre of the colour guard, flanked by two or more individuals, typically armed with rifles or sabres. A colour sergeant major typically stands behind the colours carrying a pace stick. So, the formation (when the colours are combined on parade) is as follows:

* Colour Sergeants carrying rifles
* Ensigns
* Sergeant of the Guard
* Colour Sergeant Major behind the colour

Aside from presenting arms and sabres, colour guards of the Commonwealth of Nations are expected to lower their flags to the ground in full and regular salutes in ceremonies and parades. Civilians should stand during such times and soldiers are expected to salute them when not in formation.

====United Kingdom====
As the British Army, the Royal Air Force, the Royal Marines and the Royal Navy have several types of colours, there are also colour guards for these colours and these colours and their colour guards are as follows:

=====British Army (infantry)=====

* King&#x27;s Colour – Union Flag (Crimson with insignia and the honours for the Guards Division)
*: Colour Sergeants and Ensign
* State Colour – Crimson with insignia and the honours and the royal cypher at the corners, used only for the Guards Division in ceremonies in the presence of the monarch
*:Colour Sergeants and Ensign
* Regimental colour – Union Flag on the canton with the regimental arms and honours
** Foot Guards regiments (Union Flag)
** Royal regiments (navy blue)
** Royal Irish Regiment (green)
** other regimental colours
*: same as in the King&#x27;s Colour
* Combined Colour Guards (units)

=====British Army (cavalry)=====
In the cavalry, the King&#x27;s Standard or Guidon and the regimental/squadron standard or guidon (for the light cavalry only) are the equivalents to the King&#x27;s and regimental colours.
* King&#x27;s Standard – Crimson with the royal coat of arms, the royal cypher and the regimental honours

* Combined Colour Guards (units)
*: Colour Corporals/Sergeants, Warrant Officers, Guard Corporal/Sergeant of the Colours, Colours Corporal Major (Household Cavalry), Colours Sergeant Major (other cavalry and armour units)

Colour guards in the artillery units are technically the lead gun&#x27;s crew and leader (except in the Honourable Artillery Company which uses both guns and colours) and there are no colour guards in the rifle regiments (nowadays The Rifles), the Royal Gurkha Rifles (which use the King&#x27;s Truncheon) and in the Royal Hospital in Chelsea.

=====Royal Navy=====
All of the RN&#x27;s King&#x27;s Colours are identical. Within the RN a colour guard unit consists of:

* King&#x27;s Colour – White Ensign defaced with the sovereign&#x27;s cypher and inscribed with honours
*: Ensigns and escorts
* White Ensign
*: Same as King&#x27;s Colour
* Combined Colour Guards

*: Ensigns and escorts
* Combined Colour Guards for the RM
*: Escorts, Ensigns, Guard Sergeant of the Colours, CSM

=== France ===

A French colour guards typically includes one ensign holding the flag of France as the national colour, two non-commissioned officers assisting the ensign, and three enlisted personnel behind to guard the colour.

The colour guards of France&#x27;s military academies tend to wear swords; those of NCO schools, other educational institutions and active units carry rifles instead. This design is used in other countries with Francophone populations.

French colour guards render honours on the command of present arms (présentez arme). On command, the two NCOs and three enlisted will execute present arms, whether it be by presenting their sabre vertically or by putting the right hand over the handle of their weapon while the ensign lowers the national colour/unit colour somewhere close to their legs. On some occasions, the flag is not lowered unless the guard is in the presence of a dignitary (such as the President of the Republic) or a military leader (such as the Chief of the Defence Staff).

=== Germany ===
Colour guards of the Bundeswehr follow the old German traditions of a three-man colour guard team. A tradition stemming from the days of empire, the colour guard is made up of an ensign, usually a senior NCO (and historically a lieutenant), and two unarmed escorts.

=== Indonesia ===

In Indonesia, the colour guard is known as &quot;Pataka&quot; an abbreviation from the Indonesian term &quot;Pasukan Tanda Kehormatan&quot; which is the term used in various uniformed institutions including the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI), the Indonesian National Police (Polri), the Municipal Police units, etc. The Pataka consists of white-uniformed 9 to 12 guardsmen which are present during ceremonial events carrying and escorting the Colour of the institution. The Pataka are modeled from the former Dutch practice and is led by a colour sergeant positioned at the middle of the guard (rear of the ensign), while the ensign who carries the colour is usually a junior lieutenant (2nd Lieutenant or Ensign). For a battalion level, the colour is carried by a Sergeant/chief petty officer. In the case of a massed colour guard, the Ensign (1st Lieutenant/Lieutenant (junior grade) rank leads the formation. In the Army, the Horse Cavalry Detachment (&quot;Detasemen Kavaleri Berkuda&quot;) maintains a mounted colour guard unit.

====Composition====
* Colour officer
* Lead squad carrying the unit colour or national flag
** One colour sergeant/ensign
** Two non-commissioned officers escorting the colour
* Relief squad 
** One replacement colour sergeant/ensign
** Two non-commissioned officers
* Rear guard squad of three enlisted personnel (two squads of 3–4 in the Indonesian Marine Corps)

The uniform of the colour guard in Indonesia is all-white, wearing a white ceremonial combat helmet similar to the M1 helmet, white full dress uniforms, white leather flag carrier worn by the ensign, and white parade boots. The colour guard from the military or police usually carries the Lee–Enfield or M1 Garand rifle, but sometimes the M16, FN FAL or Pindad SS1 rifle is used.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, an &quot;Escolta de la bandera&quot; or &quot;Escolta&quot; is used to describe colour guards and flag parties in the Spanish language. In Mexico these formations are made up of six individuals: the flag party commander and the escort proper of around 5, following the French practice. In the Mexican Armed Forces, National Guard and state police formations the colour escort squad is made up of:

* Ensign carrying the Flag of Mexico as National Colour (Infantry and other units)/National Standard (Cavalry and Artillery (the latter in the Army only))
* Two escorts
* Rear section of two escorts

In Mexican schools, during flag ceremonies—or as known in Mexico &quot;juramentos a la bandera&quot; or &quot;honores a la bandera&quot;—the school&#x27;s colour guard march around the schoolyard while the rest of the students and school staff sing the national anthem; once they finish, the pledge of allegiance is recited, even though it&#x27;s not mandated by law to do so, and finally the colour guard march off.

Normally, the honour of being part of such colour guards—or as known in Mexico &quot;escoltas&quot;—is bestowed upon disciplined students with high grades in the latest school year (6th grade in elementary schools, 9th grade in middle schools, and 12th grade in high schools). Sometimes, though, students from lower years or with lower grades may be chosen. Some schools only employ female students.

The layout consists of the flag-bearer flanked by two escorts—the right and the left escort—on the rear there are two rearguards and finally to the right escort&#x27;s right is the commander. Normally the shortest members happen to be the rearguards. They wear their school dress or athletic uniform.

===Netherlands===
The Dutch armed forces have similar ranks corresponding to a colour guard, the &quot;vaandrig&quot; and &quot;kornet&quot; (aspirant officers who have not been sworn in yet). The colour guard practice mirrors that of the United Kingdom, with an ensign of second lieutenant rank (or equivalent), armed escorts, and a colour guard commander. All wear full dress uniform as a general rule.

=== Post-Soviet states ===

The practices of the colour guards for the armed forces of a number of post-Soviet states in the Commonwealth of Independent States are similar to one another, adopting the practice from the former Soviet Armed Forces. Colour guards from these states are typically composed of a colour officer, one ensign or senior NCO holding the flag of their respective country as the national colour or the unit colour, and two enlisted personnel assisting the ensign. Active units, military academies, and guards of honour carry sabers in the colour guard, if needed, rifles may be substituted. The guard wears full or combat dress uniform.

If there are multiple colour guards marching in a parade at the same time, one guard is required to march directly behind the first guard. During the Soviet era, the Soviet flag was never allowed to be paraded by a military colour guard, with military and regimental flags only being paraded in colour guards. On occasion during the Soviet era, the Victory Banner was also used in colour guard teams, with the last known occasions being in 1975, 1977, 1985, 1987 and 1990.

However, several post-Soviet armed forces have deviated/modified the practices of the former Soviet colour guard; evident with the colour guards of the Turkmen Ground Forces, and the Armed Forces of Ukraine, whose colour guards dip their flags as a form of salute.

The customs practiced by the colour guards of the former Soviet Armed Forces was also adopted by the Mongolian Armed Forces, given the historical relationship between the two countries. Other countries such as Afghanistan, Cuba (replacing the United States practice after 1959), North Korea and Vietnam have adopted this variant of the Soviet system.

=== Romania === 
A standard template for a colour guard formation in the Romanian Armed Forces follows French precedent but with the addition of a colour officer leading the formation. The front of the guard is made up of the ensign, a junior officer, flanked by two armed or unarmed escorts, together with the colour officer, with three rear escorts behind the ensign.

From 1949 to 1986 the Army of the Socialist Republic of Romania and Securitate followed Soviet practice in colour guard training and protocols. Since that year the old tradition was restored in the uniformed organizations and thus remains till today in the country.

Colours of battalions and brigades are not provided with a colour guard at all since they were introduced in the 2000s.

=== Serbia ===
Given a shared heritage with Austria and Turkey plus its own traditions, the modern Serbian Armed Forces maintains a colour guard component. Every unit of the Armed Forces has a colour company that includes the colour company commander and the colour guards; which includes one ensign, usually a subaltern officer, two armed senior NCOs serving as colour escorts, and two honour guard platoons guarding the colour from the rear also armed. Unlike in other countries the colour guard company wears either full or combat dress. The Guard of the Serbian Armed Forces has its colour company wearing dress uniform.

===Sweden===

In Sweden the colour guard can be composed in three distinct manners: Greater colour guard, smaller colour guard and an officers guard. Each regiment, or military unit that carries a colour, in Sweden sets up its own colour guard. The Swedish military rank of fänrik (and the corresponding cavalry rank of &quot;kornett&quot;) was originally intended for the holder of the company flag. This duty was considered so prestigious that an officer was necessary to carry it out. Today, it is a regular officer rank.

====Composition====
A expanded colour guard composed of two commissioned officers, called &quot;fanförare&quot; (ensigns, literally &quot;carriers of the colour&quot;) and eight enlisted personnel behind the colour or colours. This stems from the time of king Gustavus Adolphus and the Thirty Years&#x27; War when all Swedish regiments had eight battalions. Each battalion contributed one soldier to the common colour guard. If one colour is carried the second officer serves as the colour officer.

A smaller colour guard is composed of one commissioned officer and four enlisted soldiers. An officers colour guard is composed of three commissioned officers, one ensign and two officer escorts carrying sabres.

===United States===
In the military of the United States, the colour guard carries the national colour and other flags appropriate to its position in the chain of command. Typically these include a unit flag and a departmental flag (Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force, Space Force or Coast Guard, plus the National Guard Bureau (Army and/or Air Force)). In addition to the flag bearers, who are positioned in the center of the colour guard, there are two or more individuals who carry rifles and or sabres. This is a symbol that the flag (and its nation) will always be protected.

====Composition of the US colour guard====
In the U.S., traditionally, the unit&#x27;s sergeant major is responsible for the safeguarding, care, and display of the organizational colours. The sergeant major is also responsible for the selection, training, and performance of the members. The colour guard consists of enlisted members and is commanded by the senior (colour) Sergeant, who carries the National Colors and gives the necessary commands for movements and rendering honours during drill exercises or parade ceremonies.

Being assigned to the colour guard is considered an honour due to the fact that these individuals present and carry the symbols of their unit and country. Depending on the circumstance and subject to the orders of their commander, members may wear full dress or less formal uniforms. It is mandatory for all members of the colour guard to wear headgear, for example, a garrison cap, beret, or service cap. On occasion, certain colour guards can be horse-mounted.

A US colour guard is made up of a &quot;Color Sergeant&quot; carrying the National Colours and serves as the unit commander, a unit or command colour bearer, and two colour escorts carrying rifles and/or sabres. If multiple colours are carried, multiple colour bearers may be needed.

====Rendering honours and Maneuvering====
The U.S. colour guard is formed and marched in one rank at close interval. Since the National Colors must always be in the position of honour on the right, the colour guard must execute a special movement to reverse direction. It does not execute rear march, nor does it execute about face. Rather, it performs a maneuver derived from the standard counter-column command, generally known as &quot;counter march&quot; or &quot;color reverse march&quot;, in order to keep the precedence of flags in order.

Other drill movements performed by the colour guard include presenting arms, left and right wheel (turns) marches, eyes right (upon passing the reviewing stand during a parade), casing / uncasing the colour, and fixing/unfixing bayonets (by the arms bearers).
Liberation Day parade.

The colour guard renders honours when the national anthem is played or sung, when passing in review during a parade, or in certain other circumstances. In these cases, the unit and departmental flags salute by dipping (leaning the flag forward). However, with the exception of a response to a naval salute, the United States national flag renders no salute. This is enshrined in the United States Flag Code and U.S. law.

In the U.S. military, individuals or units passing or being passed by uncased (unfurled) colours render honours when outdoors. Individuals who are not part of any formation begin the hand salute when the colours are six paces distant and hold it until they have passed six paces beyond the colours.

Civilians are expected to stand at the position of attention with their right hand placed over their heart for the same period, and the hand salute applies to uniformed organizations as well (specifically the Boy Scouts of America and Girl Scouts of the USA). Since recently, veterans are expected to hand salute the colours too, like their military counterparts including personnel not in uniform.

<text>Multi-user software is computer software that allows access by multiple users of a computer. Time-sharing systems are multi-user systems. Most batch processing systems for mainframe computers may also be considered &quot;multi-user&quot;, to avoid leaving the CPU idle while it waits for I/O operations to complete. However, the term &quot;multitasking&quot; is more common in this context.

An example is a Unix or Unix-like system where multiple remote users have access (such as via a serial port or Secure Shell) to the Unix shell prompt at the same time. Another example uses multiple X Window sessions spread across multiple terminals powered by a single machine – this is an example of the use of thin client. Similar functions were also available in a variety of non-Unix-like operating systems, such as Multics, VM/CMS, OpenVMS, MP/M, Concurrent CP/M, Concurrent DOS, FlexOS, Multiuser DOS, REAL/32, OASIS, THEOS, PC-MOS, TSX-32 and VM/386.

Some multi-user operating systems such as Windows versions from the Windows NT family support simultaneous access by multiple users (for example, via Remote Desktop Connection) as well as the ability for a user to disconnect from a local session while leaving processes running (doing work on their behalf) while another user logs into and uses the system. The operating system provides isolation of each user&#x27;s processes from other users, while enabling them to execute concurrently.

Management systems are implicitly designed to be used by multiple users, typically one system administrator or more and an end-user community.

The complementary term, single-user, is most commonly used when talking about an operating system being usable only by one person at a time, or in reference to a single-user software license agreement. Multi-user operating systems such as Unix sometimes have a single user mode or runlevel available for emergency maintenance. Examples of single-user operating systems include MS-DOS, OS/2 and Classic Mac OS.

<doc id="39752" wikidata="Q499387" url="?curid=39752" title="Sousaphone">
<text>The sousaphone ( ) is a brass musical instrument in the tuba family. Created around 1893 by J. W. Pepper at the direction of American bandleader John Philip Sousa (after whom the instrument was then named), it was designed to be easier to play than the concert tuba while standing or marching, as well as to carry the sound of the instrument above the heads of the band. Like the tuba, sound is produced by moving air past the lips, causing them to vibrate or &quot;buzz&quot; into a large cupped mouthpiece. Unlike the tuba, the instrument is bent in a circle to fit around the body of the musician; it ends in a large, flaring bell that is pointed forward, projecting the sound ahead of the player. Because of the ease of carrying and the direction of sound, it is widely employed in marching bands, as well as various other musical genres. Sousaphones were originally made of brass. Beginning in the mid-20th century, some sousaphones have also been made of lighter materials, such as fiberglass and plastic.

==History==

The first sousaphone was built by James Walsh Pepper in 1893 at the request of John Philip Sousa, who was dissatisfied with the hélicons in use by the United States Marine Band. Some sources credit C. G. Conn with its construction, because of the first sousaphone he built later in 1898. Sousa wanted a tuba-like instrument that would send sound upward and over the band, much like a concert (upright) tuba. The new instrument had an oversized bell pointing straight up, rather than the directional bell of a normal hélicon.

The sousaphone was initially developed as a concert instrument rather than for marching. Sousa wanted the new instrument for the professional band which he started after leaving the Marines, and this band marched only once. Sousa mainly used sousaphones built by C.G. Conn. Although less balanced on a player&#x27;s body than a helicon, because of the large spectacular bell high in the air, the sousaphone retained the tuba-like sound by widening the bore and throat of the instrument significantly. Its upright bell led to the instrument being dubbed a &quot;rain-catcher&quot;. Some versions of this design allowed the bell to also rotate forward, projecting the sound to the front of the band. This bell configuration remained the standard for several decades and is the standard today.

The instrument proved practical for marching, and by 1908 the United States Marine Band adopted it.

Versions with the characteristic extra 90° bend making a forward-facing bell were developed in the early 1900s. Early sousaphones had bells, with bells popular in the 1920s. From the mid-1930s onward, sousaphone bells have been standardized at a diameter of . Some larger sousaphones (Monster, Grand, Jumbo, Giant or Grand Jumbo, depending on brand) were produced in limited quantities.

==Construction==

The sousaphone is a valved brass instrument with the same tube length and musical range as other tubas. The sousaphone&#x27;s shape is such that the bell is above the tubist&#x27;s head and projecting forward. The valves are situated directly in front of the musician slightly above the waist and all of the weight rests on the left shoulder. The bell is normally detachable from the instrument body to facilitate transportation and storage. Except for the instrument&#x27;s general shape and appearance, the sousaphone is technically similar to a tuba.

For simplicity and light weight, modern sousaphones almost always use three non-compensating piston valves in their construction, in direct contrast to their concert counterparts&#x27; large variation in number, type, and orientation. Both the tuba and sousaphone are semi-conical brass instruments. No valved brass instrument can be entirely conical, since the middle section containing the valves must be cylindrical. While the degree of bore conicity does affect the timbre of the instrument, much as in a cornet and trumpet, or a euphonium and a trombone, the bore profile of a sousaphone is similar to that of most tubas.

To facilitate making the mouthpiece accessible to players of different height or body shapes, most sousaphones contain a detachable tubing gooseneck which arises from the lead pipe on the upwind side of the valves. One or two slightly-angled bit(s) (short tubing lengths) are inserted into the gooseneck, and then the mouthpiece is inserted into the terminal bit. This arrangement may be adjusted in height and yaw angle to place the mouthpiece comfortably at the player&#x27;s lips.

===Materials===

Most sousaphones are manufactured from sheet brass, usually yellow or silver, with silver, lacquer, and gold plating options, much like many brass instruments. However, the sousaphone (uniquely) is also commonly seen manufactured from fiberglass, due to its lower cost, greater durability, and significantly lighter weight.

The weight of a sousaphone can be between and .

===Pitch===
Most modern sousaphones are made in the key of BB (Low B Flat) and like tubas (which are commonly made in pitches of BB, CC, EE, and F) the instrument&#x27;s part is written in &quot;concert pitch&quot;, not transposed by key for a specific instrument. Although sousaphones may have a more restricted range than their concert tuba counterpart (most sousaphones have 3 valves instead of 4 to reduce weight), generally they can all play the same music and usually have parts written in the bass clef and the indicated octave is played (unlike double bass or electric bass that sound an octave lower than the indicated note). Many older sousaphones were pitched in the key of E, but current production of sousaphones in that key is limited.

Although most major instrument manufacturers have made, and many continue to make, sousaphones, Conn and King (H.N. White) instruments are generally agreed among players to be the standards against which other sousaphones are judged for tone quality and playability. Perhaps the most highly regarded sousaphone ever built is the Conn model 20K, introduced in the mid-1930s and still in production. Some players, especially those who find the 20K too heavy for marching, prefer the slightly smaller King model 1250, first made in the late 1920s and also still in production as model 2350. Historically, Holton, York and Martin sousaphones have also been considered fine horns.

Very large bore (&gt;= 0.750 inch) sousaphones, with oversized bells as large as in diameter, were made by Conn (&quot;Grand Jumbo&quot; [46K (3-valve) &amp; 48K (4-valve)]) and King (&quot;Jumbo&quot; [1265 (3- &amp; 4-valve versions)] &amp; &quot;Giant&quot; [1270 (3-valve) &amp; 1271 (4-valve)]) in the mid-1920s and 1930s, and by Martin, York, &amp; Buescher, but they disappeared from the catalogs during the Depression or at the onset of World War II. Because of their weight and cost, few were made and even fewer survive, especially the 4-valve models.

===Fiberglass===

Since 1961, sousaphones have been available made of fiberglass reinforced plastics instead of brass; RMC-Reynolds announced their new 18-pound instrument that year (branded as &quot;Reynolds&quot; or &quot;Martin&quot;) and Conn&#x27;s 16-3/4-pound 36K debuted soon thereafter. King first advertised its new 18-1/2 pound &quot;1280&quot; model in 1964, as did Holton with its FG-122 and Selmer with its Buescher-division instrument. Olds first advertised its fiberglass instrument in 1966. The fiberglass versions are used mainly for marching, with brass instruments being used for all other situations. Fiberglass sousaphones can be found commonly in younger marching bands, such as middle schools, due to their lighter weight. Depending on the model, the fiberglass version does not have as dark and rich a tone as the brass (King fiberglass sousaphones tended to have smooth fiberglass and a tone somewhat more like a brass sousaphone; Conn fiberglass sousaphones often had rough fiberglass exteriors and a thinner sound; the Conn is also lighter).

===Additional valves===
In the 1920s and 1930s, four-valved sousaphones were often used by professional players, especially E sousaphones; today, however, four-valved B sousaphones are uncommon and are prized by collectors, especially those made by Conn, King (H.N. White), and Holton. Jupiter Company started production of four-valve BB sousaphones in the late 2000s, and Dynasty USA makes a four-valve BB sousaphone as well. Criticisms of the fourth valve on a sousaphone center on additional weight, although the fourth valve improves intonation and facilitates playing of the lower register.

Due to the large size of most sousaphones, the sub-contra register (for which the fourth valve is largely intended) is already covered by alternate resonances, known as &quot;false tones&quot; (see Tuba article). Many beginners are not aware of the false-tone resonances on their sousaphones because these notes reside in the sub-contra register, which is nearly impossible for most beginners to access. Some professionals develop a &quot;raised embouchure&quot; to securely play these notes. This is where either the upper or lower lip (depending on the player) takes up most of the mouthpiece area. The embouchure provides almost twice the room for vibration of the single lip (compared to the 50–50 embouchure).

===Non-American sousaphones===
Asian sousaphones made in China and India are gaining popularity in the street band market. In Switzerland and Southern Germany, &quot;Guggenmusik&quot; bands often use these instruments that provide great display and passable tone. Most are tuned in E. Brands like Zweiss with older British designs make affordable sousaphones that have broken the €500 barrier. These are mostly in the medium-bell size of . Chinese brands are mostly reverse-engineered models and quite passable.

==Special effects==

In large marching bands of the United States, the bell is often covered with a tight fitting cloth, called a sock, which enables the sousaphone section to spell out the school&#x27;s name, initials, or mascot. The Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band Tööbz! have a tradition of painting the front surface of their sousaphone bells with a variety of images.

Sousaphone players are also known to perform the &#x27;flaming tubas&#x27;, in which flash paper is ignited in the bell, thus making it appear as if the musician is breathing fire. David Silverman developed a propane powered flaming sousaphone with a trigger valve to control an array of flame jets across the top of the bell of his horn.
The Yale Precision Marching Band has made a tradition of setting fire to the tops of the bells of their sousaphones, including in the fall of 1992 when sousaphones served as the &quot;candles&quot; of a &quot;wedding cake&quot; formed by the band when two band alumni were married during a halftime show. They also utilize what they refer to as the &quot;Überphone&quot;, a sousaphone that was disassembled from its coiled format and welded back together on a twelve-foot frame to extend straight up from the player&#x27;s shoulders.

==College marching bands==
John Philip Sousa was a benefactor of the University of Illinois music program and a friend of the university&#x27;s Director of Bands Albert Austin Harding. The Marching Illini became the first band to march in a football halftime show, and were the first band to use sousaphones on the field.

The sousaphone sections of some marching bands have developed specialized performance traditions. The University of California Marching Band Bass section traditionally &quot;struts&quot; during the band&#x27;s pregame show. During the &quot;strut&quot; the section separates from the rest of the band, circles the North goal post, and rejoins the band to complete the Script Cal. The University of Southern California Trojan Marching Band sousaphones play John Williams&#x27; &quot;Imperial March&quot; from &quot;Star Wars&quot; in single file when crossing streets on their way to and from performances on the USC campus. When The Ohio State University Marching Band performs its traditional Script Ohio formation, a senior sousaphone player dots the &quot;i&quot;.

The Fightin&#x27; Texas Aggie Band sousaphone section (called &quot;Bass Horns&quot; within the university) execute a distinct two-step and four-step counter-march during marching performances. During halftime performances this is accompanied (specifically for the last rank consisting all of 12 bass horns) by a &quot;huh! huh!&quot; from the crowd.

The University of Delaware Fightin&#x27; Blue Hen Marching Band has several traditions involving sousaphone players. During pre-game, they branch off from the rest of the band. From here, the sousaphone players run in a snake around the field jumping to drum line cadence. At most pre-games they act out a skit as well. At post game, &quot;In My Life&quot; by The Beatles is played featuring a sousaphone solo while the band sings.

==Musical genres==

The sousaphone is an important fixture of the New Orleans brass band tradition and is still used in groups such as the Dirty Dozen Brass Band by Kirk Joseph. Soul Rebels Brass Band from New Orleans features sousaphone player Edward Lee Jr.

Sinaloa, a state of Mexico, has a type of music called Banda Sinaloense, and the sousaphone is used there as a tuba.

Damon &quot;Tuba Gooding Jr.&quot; Bryson from The Roots played the sousaphone on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;. He now does this for &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;.

Nat Mcintosh is the sousaphone player and co-founder of Youngblood Brass Band, who play a mixture of traditional New Orleans style brass band music and hip hop.

The Lemon Bucket Orkestra, a Canadian self-described &quot;Balkan-Klezmer-Gypsy-Punk-Super-Party-Band&quot;, features a sousaphone as one of their instruments.

Red Baraat, a Brooklyn-based dhol &amp; brass band that fuses North Indian Bhangra with hip-hop, go-go and jazz music, features John Altieri on sousaphone.

In Israel there&#x27;s a growing scene of brass bands that use Sousaphone for the bass function, including acts such as Marsh Dondurma, Las Piratas Piratas and Pam Pah Orkestra.

==Notable players==
Warren G. Harding, the 29th President of the United States, was a sousaphone player who played well enough to join the band celebrating his election.

Jeanie Schroder of the band DeVotchKa plays sousaphone on several of the band&#x27;s songs.

Tuba Gooding Jr. (Damon Bryson) plays sousaphone for The Roots.

<doc id="39753" wikidata="Q295935" url="?curid=39753" title="John Philip Sousa">
<text>John Philip Sousa ( , ; November 6, 1854 – March 6, 1932) was an American composer and conductor of the late Romantic era known primarily for American military marches. He is known as &quot;The March King&quot; or the &quot;American March King&quot;, to distinguish him from his British counterpart Kenneth J. Alford. Among Sousa&#x27;s best-known marches are &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; (National March of the United States of America), &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; (official march of the United States Marine Corps), &quot;The Liberty Bell&quot;, &quot;The Thunderer&quot;, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

Sousa began his career playing violin and studying music theory and composition under John Esputa and George Felix Benkert. Sousa&#x27;s father enlisted him in the United States Marine Band as an apprentice in 1868. Sousa left the band in 1875, and over the next five years, he performed as a violinist and learned to conduct. In 1880, Sousa rejoined the Marine Band and served there for 12 years as director. In 1892 he left the Marine Band and organized the civilian Sousa Band. From 1880 until his death, Sousa focused exclusively on conducting and writing music. He aided in the development of the sousaphone, a large brass instrument similar to the helicon and tuba.

Upon the United States joining World War I, Sousa was awarded a wartime commission of lieutenant to lead the Naval Reserve Band in Illinois. He then returned to conduct the Sousa Band until his death in 1932. In the 1920s, Sousa was promoted to the permanent rank of lieutenant commander in the naval reserve.

==Early life and education==

John Philip Sousa was born in Washington, D.C., the third of 10 children of João António de Sousa (John Anthony Sousa) (September 22, 1824 – April 27, 1892), who was born in Spain to Portuguese parents, and his wife Maria Elisabeth Trinkhaus (May 20, 1826 – August 25, 1908), who was German and from Bavaria. Sousa began his music education under the tuition of John Esputa Sr., who taught him solfeggio. However, this was short-lived due to the teacher&#x27;s frequent bad temper. Sousa&#x27;s real music education began in 1861 or 1862 as a pupil of John Esputa Jr., the son of his previous teacher under whom Sousa studied violin, piano, flute, several brass instruments, and singing. Esputa shared his father&#x27;s bad temper, and the relationship between teacher and pupil was often strained, but Sousa progressed very rapidly and was also found to have perfect pitch. During this period, Sousa wrote his first composition, &quot;An Album Leaf&quot;, but Esputa dismissed it as &quot;bread and cheese&quot;, and the composition was subsequently lost.

Sousa&#x27;s father was a trombonist in the Marine Band, and he enlisted Sousa in the United States Marine Corps as an apprentice at age 13 to keep him from joining a circus band. That same year, Sousa began studying music under George Felix Benkert. Sousa was enlisted under a minority enlistment, meaning that he would not be discharged until his 21st birthday.

==Career==

In 1868, Sousa enlisted in the Marine Corps at age 13 as an apprentice musician (his rank listed as &quot;boy&quot;). Sousa completed his apprenticeship and left the Marine Corps 1875. He then began performing on the violin and joined a theatrical pit orchestra where he learned to conduct.

Sousa returned to the Marine Band as its head in 1880 and remained as its conductor until 1892. During this period, Sousa led the Marine Band through its development into the country&#x27;s premier military band. He led &quot;The President&#x27;s Own&quot; band under five presidents from Rutherford B. Hayes to Benjamin Harrison. Sousa&#x27;s band played at the inaugural balls of James A. Garfield in 1881 and Benjamin Harrison in 1889.

In July 1892, Sousa requested a discharge from the Marine Corps to pursue a financially promising civilian career as a band leader. He conducted a farewell concert at the White House on July 30, 1892, and was discharged from the Marine Corps the next day. Sousa organized The Sousa Band the year that he left the Marine Band, and it toured from 1892 to 1931 and performed at 15,623 concerts, both in America and internationally, including at the World Exposition in Paris and at the Royal Albert Hall in London. In Paris, the Sousa Band marched through the streets to the Arc de Triomphe, one of only eight parades that the band marched in during its 40 years.
Sousa was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Naval Reserve on May 31, 1917, shortly after the United States declared war on Germany and entered World War I. He was 62 years old, the mandatory retirement age for Navy officers. During the war, Sousa led the Navy Band at the Great Lakes Naval Station near Chicago, and he donated all of his naval salary except a token $1 per month to the Sailors&#x27; and Marines&#x27; Relief Fund. Sousa was discharged from active duty after the end of the war in November 1918 and returned to conducting his own band. In the early 1920s, Sousa was promoted to lieutenant commander in the Naval Reserve but did not return to active duty. He frequently wore his Navy uniform during performances for the remainder of his life.

For his service during the war, Sousa received the World War I Victory Medal and was elected as a Veteran Companion of the Military Order of Foreign Wars. He was also a member of the New York Athletic Club and Post 754 of the American Legion.

==Personal life==
On December 30, 1879, Sousa married Jane van Middlesworth Bellis (February 22, 1862 – March 11, 1944), who was descended from Adam Bellis who served in the New Jersey troops during the American Revolutionary War. They had three children: John Jr. (April 1, 1881 – May 18, 1937), Jane Priscilla (August 7, 1882 – October 28, 1958), and Helen (January 21, 1887 – October 14, 1975).

On July 15, 1881, the &quot;March King&quot; was initiated into Freemasonry by Hiram Lodge No. 10 (Now Hiram-Takoma Lodge No. 10) in Washington, D.C., where Sousa remained an active member until his death in 1932. Among other Masonic honors, Sousa was named the Honorary Band Leader of the Temple Band of Almas Shriners, the DC-based Chapter of Shriners International. A number of his compositions were for the organization, including the &quot;Nobles of the Mystic Shrine&quot; March.
In his later years, Sousa lived in Sands Point, New York. On March 6, 1932, he died of heart failure at age 77 in his room at the Abraham Lincoln Hotel in Reading, Pennsylvania. Sousa had conducted a rehearsal of &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; the day before with the Ringgold Band as its guest conductor. Sousa is buried at Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C. Every year on November 6, the Marine Band performs &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; at Sousa&#x27;s grave. His house Wildbank has been designated as a National Historic Landmark, although it remains a private home and is not open to the public.

Sousa has surviving descendants today; one of his great-grandsons, John Philip Sousa IV, works as a political activist for the Republican Party.

==Honors==
Sousa was decorated with the palms of the Order of Public Instruction of Portugal and the Order of Academic Palms of France. He also received the Royal Victorian Medal from King Edward VII of the United Kingdom in December 1901 for conducting a private birthday concert for Queen Alexandra.

In 1922, Sousa accepted the invitation of the national chapter to become an honorary member of Kappa Kappa Psi, the national honorary band fraternity. In 1932, he was initiated as an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, a national fraternity for men in music, by the fraternity&#x27;s Alpha Xi chapter at the University of Illinois.
The World War II Liberty ship was named in Sousa&#x27;s honor. The Marine Band possesses the ship&#x27;s bell, using it in performances of the &quot;Liberty Bell March&quot;.

In 1952, 20th Century Fox honored Sousa in their Technicolor feature film &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; with Clifton Webb portraying him. It was loosely based on Sousa&#x27;s memoirs &quot;Marching Along&quot;.

In 1987, an act of Congress named &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; as the national march of the United States.

In 2012, a crater on the planet Mercury was named in Sousa&#x27;s honor. He was posthumously enshrined in the Hall of Fame for Great Americans in 1976.

==Memberships==
Sousa was a member of the Sons of the Revolution, Military Order of Foreign Wars, American Legion, Freemasons, and the Society of Artists and Composers. He was also a member of the Salmagundi, Players, Musicians, New York Athletic, Lambs, Army and Navy and the Gridiron clubs of Washington.

==Music==
Sousa wrote over 130 marches, 15 operettas, 5 overtures, 11 suites, 24 dances, 28 fantasies, and countless arrangements of nineteenth-century western European symphonic works.

Sousa wrote marches for several American universities, including the University of Minnesota, University of Illinois, University of Nebraska, Kansas State University, Marquette University, Pennsylvania Military College (Widener University), and the University of Michigan.

===Operettas===

Sousa wrote many notable operettas, including:
* &quot;Désirée&quot; (1883), libretto by Edward M. Taber
* &quot;El Capitan&quot; (1896), libretto by Charles Klein
* &quot;The Charlatan&quot; (1898), also known as &quot;The Mystical Miss&quot;, book by Charles Klein and lyrics by Sousa
* &quot;Chris and the Wonderful Lamp&quot; (1899), libretto by Glen MacDonough

Marches and waltzes have been derived from many of these stage-works. Sousa also composed the music for six operettas that were either unfinished or not produced: &quot;The Devils&#x27; Deputy&quot;, &quot;Florine&quot;, &quot;The Irish Dragoon&quot;, &quot;Katherine&quot;, &quot;The Victory&quot;, and &quot;The Wolf&quot;.

In addition, Sousa wrote a march based on themes from Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s comic opera &quot;The Mikado&quot;, the elegant overture &quot;Our Flirtations&quot;, several musical suites, etc. He frequently added Sullivan opera overtures or other Sullivan pieces to his concerts.

Sousa was quoted saying, &quot;My religion lies in my composition.&quot;

==Hobbies, writing, and recording==
Sousa ranked as one of the all-time great trapshooters and was enshrined in the Trapshooting Hall of Fame. He organized the first national trapshooting organization, a forerunner to today&#x27;s Amateur Trapshooting Association (ATA). He also wrote numerous articles about trapshooting. He was a regular competitor representing the Navy in trapshooting competitions, particularly against the Army. Records indicate that Sousa registered more than 35,000 targets during his shooting career. &quot;Let me say that just about the sweetest music to me is when I call, &#x27;pull,&#x27; the old gun barks, and the referee in perfect key announces, &#x27;dead&#x27;.&quot;

In Sousa&#x27;s 1902 novella &quot;The Fifth String&quot;, a virtuoso violinist makes a deal with the Devil for a magic violin with five strings. The first four strings excite the emotions of Pity, Hope, Love, and Joy, but the fifth string, made from the hair of Eve, will cause the player&#x27;s death once played. The violinist wins the love of the woman he desires, but out of jealous suspicion, she commands him to play the death string, which he does. Sousa published &quot;Pipetown Sandy&quot; in 1905, which includes a satirical poem titled &quot;The Feast of the Monkeys&quot;. He wrote a 40,000-word story entitled &quot;The Transit of Venus&quot; in 1920. Sousa also wrote the booklet &quot;A manual for trumpet and drum&quot;, published by the Ludwig Drum Company with advice for playing drums and trumpet. An early version of the trumpet solo to &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; was included in this volume.

The marching brass bass or sousaphone is a modified helicon created in 1893 by Philadelphia instrument maker J. W. Pepper at Sousa&#x27;s request, using several of his suggestions in its design. Sousa wanted a tuba that could sound upward and over the band whether its player was seated or marching. C.G. Conn recreated the instrument in 1898, and this was the model that Sousa preferred to use.
Sousa held a very low opinion of the emerging recording industry. He derided recordings as &quot;canned music&quot;, a reference to the early wax cylinder records that came in can-like cylindrical cardboard boxes. He argued to a congressional hearing in 1906:
Sousa&#x27;s antipathy to recording was such that he very rarely conducted his band when it was being recorded. Nevertheless, the band made numerous recordings, the earliest being issued on cylinders by several companies, followed by many recordings on discs by the Berliner Gramophone Company and its successor, the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor). The Berliner recordings were conducted by Henry Higgins (one of Sousa&#x27;s cornet soloists) and Arthur Pryor (Sousa&#x27;s trombone soloist and assistant conductor). Sousa claimed that he had &quot;never been in the gramophone company&#x27;s office in my life&quot;. Sousa did conduct a few of the Victor recordings, but most were conducted by Pryor, Herbert L. Clarke, Edwin H. Clarke, Walter B. Rogers (who had also been a cornet soloist with Sousa), Rosario Bourdon, Josef Pasternack, or Nathaniel Shilkret. Details of the Victor recordings are available in the external link below to the EDVR.

After the introduction of electrical recording in 1925 Sousa changed his mind about phonograph records. After a demonstration of the Orthophonic Victrola on October 6, 1925, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel he said, &quot;[Gentlemen], that is a band. This is the first time I have ever heard music with any soul to it produced by a mechanical talking machine.&quot;

Sousa also appeared with his band in newsreels and on radio broadcasts, beginning with a 1929 nationwide broadcast on NBC.

==John Philip Sousa Award==

Even after his death, Sousa continues to be remembered as &quot;The March King&quot; through the John Philip Sousa Foundation. The non-profit organization, founded in 1981, recognizes one superior student in marching band for &quot;musicianship, dependability, loyalty, and cooperation.&quot; The John Philip Sousa Foundation provides awards, scholarships, and projects such as The Sudler Trophy, The Sudler Shield, The Sudler Silver Scroll, The Sudler Flag of Honor, The Historic Roll of Honor, The Sudler Cup, The Hawkins Scholarship, National Young Artists, The National Community Band, and The Junior Honor Band Project. He won many honorable awards across his lifetime.

<text>Casimir Funk ( ; February 23, 1884 – November 19, 1967) was a Polish biochemist generally credited with being among the first to formulate the concept of vitamins after publishing a landmark medical writing in 1912. He highlighted these &quot;vital amines&quot; (or &quot;vitamines&quot;) as critical in fighting significant diseases such as pellagra and rickets, and his analysis influenced a major shift in scientific thinking. His scientific work involved research in Poland, France and the United Kingdom. In 1920, he became a citizen of the United States where he continued his work.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Warsaw (the capital of Poland), being the son of a medical specialist in dermatology. In 1904, at the age of twenty, he earned a doctorate in chemistry at the University of Bern. In his early career, he worked as a biochemist at the Pasteur Institute, the Wiesbaden Municipal Hospital, the University of Berlin, and the Lister Institute. Funk emigrated to New York State in 1915, moving back and forth between the United States and Europe until World War II. After working in that country for several years, he became a citizen of the U.S. in 1920.

Funk came from a Jewish background. Retrospective reporting by a British news agency stated that, despite studying in various European countries in the context of increasing domestic antisemitism, he succeeded in his collegiate goals, without any specific obstacles hindering his efforts at those various institutions.

==Career==

After reading an article by Christiaan Eijkman that indicated that persons who ate brown rice were less vulnerable to beri-beri than those who ate only the fully milled product, Funk tried to isolate the substance responsible, and he succeeded. Because that substance contained an amine group, he called it &quot;vitamine&quot;. It was later to be known as vitamin B3 (niacin), although he thought it would be thiamine (vitamin B1) and described it as &quot;anti-beri-beri-factor&quot;.

In 1911, he published his first paper in English, on dihydroxyphenylalanine. Funk was sure more than one substance like Vitamin B1 existed, and in his 1912 article for the &quot;Journal of State Medicine&quot;, he proposed the existence of at least four vitamins: one preventing beriberi (&quot;antiberiberi&quot;); one preventing scurvy (&quot;antiscorbutic&quot;); one preventing pellagra (&quot;antipellagric&quot;); and one preventing rickets (&quot;antirachitic&quot;). From there, Funk published a book, &quot;The Vitamines&quot;, in 1912, and later that year received a Beit Fellowship to continue his research.

Funk proposed the hypothesis that other diseases, such as rickets, pellagra, coeliac disease, and scurvy could also be cured by vitamins. Funk was an early investigator of the problem of pellagra. He suggested that a change in the method of milling corn was responsible for the outbreak of pellagra, but no attention was paid to his article on this subject.

The &quot;e&quot; at the end of &quot;vitamine&quot; was later removed, when it was realized that vitamins need not be nitrogen-containing amines. He postulated the existence of other essential nutrients, which became known as vitamins B1, B2, C, and D. In 1936, he determined the molecular structure of thiamine, though he was not the first to isolate it. Funk also conducted research into hormones, diabetes, peptic ulcers, and the biochemistry of cancer.

From 1923 to 1927 Funk was the head of the National Institute of Hygiene in Poland. In 1940, after returning to the United States, he became president of the Funk Foundation for Medical Research. He spent his last years studying the causes of neoplasms.

==Legacy==
Funk&#x27;s academic career is noted to have included serving at the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine within London, England and the Pasteur Institute within Paris, France while he additionally worked with commercial firms such as the U.S. Vitamin &amp; Pharmaceutical Corp. Upon his death, the American publication &quot;Time&quot; highlighted both Funk and Elmer Verner McCollum, the latter being known for his discovery of Vitamin A and other efforts, as having significant legacies &quot;in everyday importance&quot; for medicine, with the news organization lauding Funk as a &quot;pioneer&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; additionally commented positively upon Funk&#x27;s personal character as a &quot;research scientist [who] focused his intense curiosity on other fields&quot; given his status. A medical textbook distributed in 1997 by Taylor &amp; Francis stated that Funk&#x27;s 1912 release of his &quot;landmark publication&quot; in vitamins had internationally created a &quot;theory [that] provided a new concept for interpreting diet-related events.&quot;

Outside of vitamin-related research, Funk&#x27;s career history has been described as also having significantly extended humanity&#x27;s &quot;knowledge of sex hormones.&quot; A retrospective analysis by the British publication &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2024 stated that Funk&#x27;s discoveries as an overall body of work, especially in terms of nutrition, &quot;has helped the health of many people and led to the cures of several life-threatening diseases.&quot; A member of Funk&#x27;s family, as well, has accepted a Nutrition Hall of Fame award given to the biochemist posthumously.

== Recognition ==
The Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America (PIASA), a non-profit organization focused on advancing civil society, annually honors Polish-American scientists with the &quot;Casimir Funk Natural Sciences Award&quot;. As of February 2024, the last winner of that award was Alexander Wlodawer. An associate of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Wlodawer has become known in the U.S. as an expert on structural biology. Past winners have included Nobel Laureate Roald Hoffmann, Aleksander Wolszczan, Hilary Koprowski, Peter T. Wolczanski, Wacław Szybalski, Zbyszek Darzynkiewicz and Benoit Mandelbrot.

A Google Doodle commemorated Funk&#x27;s 140th birthday on February 23rd of 2024 in tandem with his family&#x27;s estate and its various efforts. This included working with Erik Funk, Casimir Funk&#x27;s grandson, who praised the company&#x27;s actions.

<text>Adnams is a regional brewery founded in 1872 in Southwold, Suffolk, England, by George and Ernest Adnams. It produces cask ale and bottled beers. Annual production is around 85,000 barrels.

In 2010, the company established the Copper House distillery for the production of gin, vodka and whisky.

==History==
The earliest recorded brewing on the Adnams site was in 1396 by Johanna de Corby.

The Sole Bay Brewery in Southwold was purchased in 1872 by George and Ernest Adnams. The company was incorporated in 1890, and has remained independent since then, producing a range of beers for distribution mainly in East Anglia. The Adnams family was joined in 1902 by Pierse Loftus, who brought strategic vision, technical expertise and sound financial principles, building the base on which succeeding generations have been able to build. Adnams is now a PLC, with numerous shareholders, but still has family representation on the board, with Jonathan Adnams as chairman.

The mixed-culture yeast used by Adnams was sourced from Morgans brewery of Norwich in 1942.

Until 1953 and from 1970 to 2006, casks of Adnams ale were delivered to the six pubs of Southwold by horse and dray; the tradition ended when a new distribution depot was built three miles from the brewery.

The company founded a charity, &quot;The Adnams Charity&quot;, in 1990 to celebrate its centenary as a public company. A percentage of the company&#x27;s annual profits is used to support worthwhile causes within a 25-mile radius of Southwold.

In 1993, Adnams Extra won the Champion Beer of Britain, an award presented by the Campaign for Real Ale at the annual Great British Beer Festival. Adnams remains committed to brewing cask ale and operating non-themed pubs. Cask ale is available in all its 70 pubs, and it supplies more than 1000 other outlets direct. New fermenting vessels were installed in March 2001 to cope with demand, and the brewhouse was completely re-equipped in July 2006, making it one of the most energy efficient in Europe.

At the beginning of 2004, Adnams purchased land in neighbouring village of Reydon to expand its business with a new distribution centre, designed by architect Jeremy Blake, which was nominated for the 2007 RICS East of England Award for Sustainability. Adnams was awarded a Queen&#x27;s Award for Enterprise in the sustainable development category in 2005.

The distribution centre features the UK&#x27;s largest living roof known as the Sky Garden which is made up of a variety of sedum species. Not only does this help to insulate the building, but the water stored in the sedum plants is also harvested and used to flush the staff toilets and clean company vehicles. This, combined with the solar panels and the environmental construction have meant the energy bills have been cut by half.

In June 2009, Adnams signed a five-year agreement to supply Ipswich Town FC with beers at their Portman Road stadium, replacing the 14-year-old association with Greene King. The rights went back to Greene King in July 2014. 

In 2010 Carl&#x27;s Copper Pot still and Rectifying columns were installed and put in operation in November of that same year for the production of Gin, Vodka &amp; Whisky.

In early 2019, Adnams launched a new English cider called Wild Wave.

<doc id="39762" wikidata="Q271884" url="?curid=39762" title="Norman Rockwell">
<text>Norman Percevel Rockwell (February 3, 1894 – November 8, 1978) was an American painter and illustrator. His works have a broad popular appeal in the United States for their reflection of the country&#x27;s culture. Rockwell is most famous for the cover illustrations of everyday life he created for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; magazine over nearly five decades. Among the best-known of Rockwell&#x27;s works are the &quot;Willie Gillis&quot; series, &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot;, the &quot;Four Freedoms&quot; series, &quot;Saying Grace&quot;, and &quot;The Problem We All Live With&quot;. He is also noted for his 64-year relationship with the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), during which he produced covers for their publication &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot; (now &quot;Scout Life&quot;), calendars, and other illustrations. These works include popular images that reflect the Scout Oath and &quot;Scout Law&quot; such as &quot;The Scoutmaster&quot;, &quot;A Scout Is Reverent&quot;, and &quot;A Guiding Hand&quot;.

Rockwell was a prolific artist, producing more than 4,000 original works in his lifetime. Most of his surviving works are in public collections. Rockwell was also commissioned to illustrate more than 40 books, including &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; and to paint portraits of Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon, as well as those of foreign figures, including Gamal Abdel Nasser and Jawaharlal Nehru. His portrait subjects also included Judy Garland. One of his last portraits was of Colonel Sanders in 1973. His annual contributions for the Boy Scouts calendars between 1925 and 1976 were only slightly overshadowed by his most popular of calendar works: the &quot;Four Seasons&quot; illustrations for Brown &amp; Bigelow that were published for 17 years beginning in 1947 and reproduced in various styles and sizes since 1964. He created artwork for advertisements for Coca-Cola, Jell-O, General Motors, Scott Tissue, and other companies. Illustrations for booklets, catalogs, posters (particularly movie promotions), sheet music, stamps, playing cards, and murals (including &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; and &quot;God Bless the Hills&quot;, which was completed in 1936 for the Nassau Inn in Princeton, New Jersey) rounded out Rockwell&#x27;s oeuvre as an illustrator.

Rockwell&#x27;s work was dismissed by serious art critics in his lifetime. Many of his works appear overly sweet in the opinion of modern critics, especially &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; covers, which tend toward idealistic or sentimentalized portrayals of American life. This has led to the often deprecatory adjective &quot;Rockwellesque&quot;. Consequently, Rockwell is not considered a &quot;serious painter&quot; by some contemporary artists, who regard his work as bourgeois and kitsch. Writer Vladimir Nabokov stated that Rockwell&#x27;s brilliant technique was put to &quot;banal&quot; use, and wrote in his novel &quot;Pnin&quot;: &quot;That Dalí is really Norman Rockwell&#x27;s twin brother by in babyhood.&quot; He is called an &quot;illustrator&quot; instead of an artist by some critics, a designation he did not mind, as that was what he called himself.

In his later years, Rockwell began receiving more attention as a painter when he chose more serious subjects such as the series on racism for &quot;Look&quot; magazine. One example of this more serious work is &quot;The Problem We All Live With&quot;, which dealt with the issue of school racial integration. The painting depicts Ruby Bridges, flanked by white federal marshals, walking to school past a wall defaced by racist graffiti. This 1964 painting was displayed in the White House when Bridges met with President Barack Obama in 2011.

==Life==

===Early years===

Norman Rockwell was born on February 3, 1894, in New York City, to Jarvis Waring Rockwell and Anne Mary &quot;Nancy&quot; (née Hill) Rockwell His father was a Presbyterian and his mother was an Episcopalian; two years after their engagement, he converted to the Episcopal faith. Rockwell&#x27;s earliest American ancestor was John Rockwell (1588–1662), from Somerset, England, who immigrated to colonial North America, probably in 1635, aboard the ship &quot;Hopewell&quot; and became one of the first settlers of Windsor, Connecticut. Rockwell had one brother, Jarvis Jr., older by a year and a half. Jarvis Sr. was the manager of the New York office of a Philadelphia textile firm, George Wood, Sons &amp; Company, where he spent his entire career.

Rockwell transferred from high school to the Chase Art School (later Parsons School of Design) at the age of 14. He then went on to the National Academy of Design and finally to the Art Students League of New York. There, Rockwell was taught by Thomas Fogarty, George Bridgman, and Frank Vincent DuMond; his early works were produced for &quot;St. Nicholas Magazine&quot;, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) magazine &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;, and other youth publications. As a student, Rockwell had some small jobs, including one as a supernumerary at the Metropolitan Opera. His first major artistic job came at age 18, illustrating Carl H. Claudy&#x27;s book &quot;Tell Me Why: Stories about Mother Nature&quot;.

After that, Rockwell was hired as a staff artist for &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;. In this role, he received 50 dollars&#x27; compensation each month for one completed cover and a set of story illustrations. It is said to have been his first paying job as an artist. At 19, Rockwell became the art editor for &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;, published by the Boy Scouts of America. He held the job for three years, during which Rockwell painted several covers, beginning with his first published magazine cover, &quot;Scout at Ship&#x27;s Wheel&quot;, which appeared on the &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot; September 1913 edition.

===Association with &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;===


Rockwell&#x27;s family moved to New Rochelle, New York, when Norman was 21 years old. They shared a studio with the cartoonist Clyde Forsythe, who worked for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. With Forsythe&#x27;s help, Rockwell submitted his first successful cover painting to the &quot;Post&quot; in 1916, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day Off&quot; (published on May 20). He followed that success with &quot;Circus Barker and Strongman&quot; (published on June 3), &quot;Gramps at the Plate&quot; (August 5), &quot;Redhead Loves Hatty Perkins&quot; (September 16), &quot;People in a Theatre Balcony&quot; (October 14), and &quot;Man Playing Santa&quot; (December 9). Rockwell was published eight times on the &quot;Post&quot; cover within the first year. Ultimately, Rockwell published 323 original covers for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; over 47 years. His &quot;Sharp Harmony&quot; appeared on the cover of the issue dated September 26, 1936; it depicts a barber and three clients, enjoying an a cappella song. The image was adopted by SPEBSQSA in its promotion of the art.

Rockwell&#x27;s success on the cover of the &quot;Post&quot; led to covers for other magazines of the day, most notably the &quot;Literary Digest&quot;, the &quot;Country Gentleman&quot;, &quot;Leslie&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, &quot;Judge&quot;, &quot;Peoples Popular Monthly&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

When Rockwell&#x27;s tenure began with &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in 1916, he left his salaried position at &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;, but continued to include scouts in &quot;Post&quot; cover images and the monthly magazine of the &quot;American Red Cross&quot;. He resumed work with the Boy Scouts of America in 1926 with production of his first of fifty-one original illustrations for the official Boy Scouts of America annual calendar, which still may be seen in the &quot;Norman Rockwell Art Gallery&quot; at the National Scouting Museum in Cimarron, New Mexico.

During World War I, he tried to enlist into the U.S. Navy but was refused entry because, at , he was eight pounds underweight for someone tall. To compensate, he spent one night gorging himself on bananas, liquids and doughnuts, and weighed enough to enlist the next day. He was given the role of a military artist, however, and did not see any action during his tour of duty.

===World War II===

In 1943, during World War II, Rockwell painted the &quot;Four Freedoms&quot; series, which was completed in seven months and resulted in him losing fifteen pounds. The series was inspired by a speech by Franklin D. Roosevelt, wherein Roosevelt described and articulated Four Freedoms for universal rights. Rockwell then painted &quot;Freedom from Want&quot;, &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot;, &quot;Freedom of Worship&quot; and &quot;Freedom from Fear&quot;.

The paintings were published in 1943 by &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. Rockwell used the Pennell shipbuilding family from Brunswick, Maine as models for two of the paintings, &quot;Freedom from Want&quot; and &quot;A Thankful Mother&quot;, and would combine models from photographs and his own vision to create his idealistic paintings. The United States Department of the Treasury later promoted war bonds by exhibiting the originals in sixteen cities. Rockwell considered &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot; to be the best of the four.
That same year, a fire in his studio destroyed numerous original paintings, costumes, and props. Because the period costumes and props were irreplaceable, the fire split his career into two phases, the second phase depicting modern characters and situations. Rockwell was contacted by writer Elliott Caplin, brother of cartoonist Al Capp, with the suggestion that the three of them should make a daily comic strip together, with Caplin and his brother writing and Rockwell drawing. King Features Syndicate is reported to have promised a $1,000 per week deal, knowing that a Capp–Rockwell collaboration would gain strong public interest. The project was ultimately aborted, however, as it turned out that Rockwell, known for his perfectionism as an artist, could not deliver material so quickly as would be required of him for a daily comic strip.

===Later career===
During the late 1940s, Norman Rockwell spent the winter months as artist-in-residence at Otis College of Art and Design. Occasionally, students were models for his &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; covers. In 1949, Rockwell donated an original &quot;Post&quot; cover, &quot;April Fool&quot;, to be raffled off in a library fund raiser.

In 1959, after his wife Mary died suddenly from a heart attack, Rockwell took time off from his work to grieve. It was during that break that he and his son Thomas produced Rockwell&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;My Adventures as an Illustrator&quot;, which was published in 1960. The &quot;Post&quot; printed excerpts from this book in eight consecutive issues, the first containing Rockwell&#x27;s famous &quot;Triple Self-Portrait&quot;.
Rockwell&#x27;s last painting for the &quot;Post&quot; was published in 1963, marking the end of a publishing relationship that had included 321 cover paintings. He spent the next 10 years painting for &quot;Look&quot; magazine, where his work depicted his interests in civil rights, poverty, and space exploration.

In 1966, Rockwell was invited to Hollywood to paint portraits of the stars of the film &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, and also found himself appearing as an extra in the film, playing a &quot;mangy old gambler&quot;.

In 1968, Rockwell was commissioned to do an album cover portrait of Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper for their record, &quot;The Live Adventures of Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper&quot;.

As a tribute on the 75th anniversary of Rockwell&#x27;s birth, officials of Brown &amp; Bigelow and the Boy Scouts of America asked Rockwell to pose in &quot;Beyond the Easel&quot; as the illustration for the 1969 Boy Scout calendar.

In 1969 the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation commissioned Rockwell to paint the Glen Canyon Dam.

His last commission for the Boy Scouts of America was a calendar illustration titled &quot;The Spirit of 1976&quot;, which was completed when Rockwell was 82, concluding a partnership which generated 471 images for periodicals, guidebooks, calendars, and promotional materials. His connection to the BSA spanned 64 years, marking the longest professional association of his career. His legacy and style for the BSA has been carried on by Joseph Csatari.

For &quot;vivid and affectionate portraits of our country&quot;, Rockwell was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States of America&#x27;s highest civilian honor, in 1977 by President Gerald Ford. Rockwell&#x27;s son, Jarvis, accepted the award.

====Death====

Rockwell died on November 8, 1978, of emphysema at the age of 84 in his Stockbridge, Massachusetts, home. First Lady Rosalynn Carter attended Rockwell&#x27;s funeral.

==Personal life==

Rockwell married his first wife, Irene O&#x27;Connor, on July 1, 1916. Irene was Rockwell&#x27;s model in &quot;Mother Tucking Children into Bed&quot;, published on the cover of The &quot;Literary Digest&quot; on January 19, 1921. The couple divorced on January 13, 1930.

Depressed, Rockwell moved briefly to Alhambra, California as a guest of his old friend Clyde Forsythe. There, Rockwell painted some of his best-known paintings including &quot;The Doctor and the Doll&quot;. While there, he met and married schoolteacher Mary Barstow on April 17, 1930. The couple returned to New York shortly after their marriage. They had three sons: Jarvis Waring, Thomas Rhodes, and Peter Barstow. The family lived at 24 Lord Kitchener Road in the Bonnie Crest neighborhood of New Rochelle, New York.

Rockwell and his wife were not regular church attendees, although they were members of St. John&#x27;s Wilmot Church, an Episcopal church near their home, where their sons were baptized. Rockwell moved to Arlington, Vermont, in 1939 where his work began to reflect small-town life. He would later be joined by his good friend John Carlton Atherton.

In 1953, the Rockwell family moved to Stockbridge, Massachusetts, so that his wife could be treated at the Austen Riggs Center, a psychiatric hospital at 25 Main Street, close to where Rockwell set up his studio. Rockwell also received psychiatric treatment, seeing the analyst Erik Erikson, who was on staff at Riggs. Erikson told biographer Laura Claridge that Rockwell painted his happiness, but did not live it. On August 25, 1959, Mary died unexpectedly of a heart attack.

Rockwell married his third wife, retired Milton Academy English teacher, Mary Leete &quot;Mollie&quot; Punderson (1896–1985), on October 25, 1961. His Stockbridge studio was located on the second floor of a row of buildings. Directly underneath Rockwell&#x27;s studio was, for a time in 1966, the Back Room Rest, better known as the famous &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot;. During his time in Stockbridge, chief of police William Obanhein was a frequent model for Rockwell&#x27;s paintings.

From 1961 until his death, Rockwell was a member of the Monday Evening Club, a men&#x27;s literary group based in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. At his funeral, five members of the club served as pallbearers, along with Jarvis Rockwell.

==Legacy==
A custodianship of his original paintings and drawings was established with Rockwell&#x27;s help near his home in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and the Norman Rockwell Museum still is open today year-round. The museum&#x27;s collection includes more than 700 original Rockwell paintings, drawings, and studies. The Rockwell Center for American Visual Studies at the Norman Rockwell Museum is a national research institute dedicated to American illustration art.

Rockwell&#x27;s work was exhibited at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 2001. Rockwell&#x27;s &quot;Breaking Home Ties&quot; sold for $15.4 million at a 2006 Sotheby&#x27;s auction. A 12-city U.S. tour of Rockwell&#x27;s works took place in 2008.
In 2008, Rockwell was named the official state artist of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The 2013 sale of &quot;Saying Grace&quot; for $46 million (including buyer&#x27;s premium) established a new record price for Rockwell. Rockwell&#x27;s work was exhibited at the Reading Public Museum and the Church History Museum in 2013–2014.
* In &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977) Alvy (Woody Allen) teases Annie (Diane Keaton) saying: &quot;What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?&quot;.
* In 1981, Rockwell&#x27;s painting &quot;Girl at Mirror&quot; was used for the cover of Prism&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Small Change&quot;.
* Rockwell is among the figures depicted in &quot;Our Nation&#x27;s 200th Birthday, The Telephone&#x27;s 100th Birthday&quot; (1976) by Stanley Meltzoff for Bell System which Meltzoff based on Rockwell&#x27;s 1948 painting &quot;The Gossips&quot;.
* In the film &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;, a young boy (played by Christian Bale) is put to bed by his loving parents in a scene also inspired by a Rockwell painting—a reproduction of which is later kept by the young boy during his captivity in a prison camp (&quot;Freedom from Fear&quot;, 1943).
* The 1994 film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; includes a shot in a school that re-creates Rockwell&#x27;s &quot;Girl with Black Eye&quot; with young Forrest in place of the girl. Much of the film drew heavy visual inspiration from Rockwell&#x27;s art.
* Film director George Lucas owns Rockwell&#x27;s original of &quot;The Peach Crop&quot;, and his colleague Steven Spielberg owns a sketch of Rockwell&#x27;s &quot;Triple Self-Portrait&quot;. Each of the artworks hangs in the respective filmmaker&#x27;s work space. Rockwell is a major character in an episode of Lucas&#x27; &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Passion for Life&quot;, portrayed by Lukas Haas.
*Museum director Thomas S. Buechner said that Rockwell&#x27;s art is important for standing the test of time, &quot;When the last half century is explored by the future, a few paintings will continue to communicate with the same immediacy and veracity they have today.&quot;
* In 2005, May Corporation, that previously bought Marshall Field&#x27;s from Target Corp., was bought by Federated Department Stores. After the sale, Federated discovered that Rockwell&#x27;s &quot;The Clock Mender&quot; displayed in the store was a reproduction. Rockwell had donated the painting, which depicts a repairman setting the time on one of the Marshall Field and Company Building clocks, and was depicted on the cover of the November 3, 1945 &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, to the store in 1948. Target had since donated the original to the Chicago History Museum.
* On an anniversary of Norman Rockwell&#x27;s birth, on February 3, 2010, Google featured Rockwell&#x27;s iconic image of young love &quot;Boy and Girl Gazing at the Moon&quot;, which is also known as &quot;Puppy Love&quot;, on its home page. The response was so great that day that the Norman Rockwell museum&#x27;s servers were overwhelmed by the volume of traffic.
* &quot;Dreamland&quot;, a track from Canadian alternative rock band Our Lady Peace&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Burn Burn&quot;, was inspired by Rockwell&#x27;s paintings.
* The cover for the Oingo Boingo album &quot;Only a Lad&quot; is a parody of the Boy Scouts of America 1960 official handbook cover illustrated by Rockwell.
* Lana Del Rey named her sixth studio album, &quot;Norman Fucking Rockwell!&quot; (2019), after Rockwell.

<doc id="39763" wikidata="Q29014" url="?curid=39763" title="Millennium Dome">
<text>The Millennium Dome was the original name of the large dome-shaped building on the Greenwich Peninsula in South East London, England, which housed a major exhibition celebrating the beginning of the third millennium. As of 2022, it is the ninth largest building in the world by usable volume. The exhibition was open to the public from 1 January to 31 December 2000. The project and exhibition were highly contentious and attracted barely half of the 12 million customers its sponsors forecasted, and so were deemed a failure by the press. All the original exhibition elements were sold or dismantled.

In a 2005 report, the cost of the Dome and surrounding land (which increased to 170 acres from the initial offering of the 48 acres enclosed by the Dome) and managing the Dome until the deal was closed was £28.7 million. The value of the 48 acres occupied by the Dome was estimated at £48 million, which could have been realised by demolishing the structure, but it was considered preferable to preserve the Dome. The structure itself still exists and is now a key exterior feature of The O2.

The Prime Meridian passes the western edge of the Dome and the nearest London Underground station is North Greenwich on the Jubilee line.

== Architecture ==

The dome is one of the largest of its type in the world. Externally, it appears as a large white marquee with twelve yellow support towers, one for each month of the year, or each hour of the clock face, representing the role played by Greenwich Mean Time. In plan view it is circular, ( for each day in a standard year) in diameter. It has become one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s most recognisable landmarks, and can be easily identified on satellite images of London. 

The architect was Richard Rogers and the contractor was a joint venture company, McAlpine/Laing Joint Venture (MLJV) formed between Sir Robert McAlpine and Laing Management. The building structure was engineered by Buro Happold, and the entire roof structure weighs less than the air contained within the building. Although referred to as a dome it is &quot;not a dome in the structural sense [...] In this building, a dome-shaped cable network is supported on a ring of [...] masts&quot;. It has been disparagingly referred to as the Millennium Tent.

The canopy is high in the middle – for each week of the year and is made of durable and weather-resistant PTFE-coated glass fibre fabric panels (original plans to use PVC-coated polyester fabric were dropped after protest led by Greenpeace), with each of the 72 segments containing two panels. Its symmetry is interrupted by a hole through which a ventilation shaft from the Blackwall Tunnel rises. Six segments were destroyed during Storm Eunice on 18 February 2022.

Built in 15 months, the dome structure was delivered under budget, at a cost of £43m.

The critic Jonathan Meades has scathingly referred to the Millennium Dome as a &quot;Museum of Toxic Waste&quot;, and apart from the dome itself, the project included the reclamation of the entire Greenwich Peninsula. The land was previously derelict and contaminated by toxic sludge from East Greenwich Gas Works that operated from 1889 to 1985. The clean-up operation was seen by the then Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine as an investment that would add a large area of useful land to the crowded capital.

==Background to the Dome project==
The Dome project was conceived, originally on a somewhat smaller scale, under John Major&#x27;s Conservative government, as a Festival of Britain or World&#x27;s Fair-type showcase to celebrate the third millennium. The incoming Labour government elected in 1997 under Tony Blair greatly expanded the size, scope and funding of the project, and construction began in June 1997. It also significantly increased expectations of what would be delivered. Just before its opening Blair claimed the Dome would be &quot;a triumph of confidence over cynicism, boldness over blandness, excellence over mediocrity&quot;. In the words of BBC correspondent Robert Orchard, &quot;the Dome was to be highlighted as a glittering New Labour achievement in the next election manifesto&quot;, but criticised in the 2001 Conservative Party manifesto as &quot;banal, anonymous and rootless&quot;, and lacking &quot;a sense of Britain&#x27;s history or culture&quot;. Following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, a member of the Dome&#x27;s board suggested the project be refashioned and extended &quot;to accommodate, for example, a hospital, businesses, charities, private residences, and the whole thing named &#x27;the Princess Diana Centre. The idea was later scrapped.

Before its opening, the Dome was excoriated in Iain Sinclair&#x27;s diatribe, &quot;Sorry Meniscus – Excursions to the Millennium Dome&quot; (Profile Books: London 1999, ), which forecast the hype, the associated political posturing, and the eventual disillusion. The post-exhibition plan had been to convert the Dome into a European football stadium which would last for 25 years: Charlton Athletic at one point considered a possible move but instead chose to redevelop their own stadium. Local team Fisher Athletic were at one time interested in moving to the Dome, but they were considered to have too small a fan base to make this feasible. The Dome was planned to take over the functions performed by the London Arena after its closure. This is the function which The O2 Arena has now undertaken.

== Millennium Experience ==

After a private opening on the evening of 31 December 1999, including a New Year&#x27;s Eve celebration attended by Queen Elizabeth II, the Millennium Experience at the Dome was open to the public for the whole of 2000, and contained a large number of attractions and exhibits.

=== Millennium Dome Show ===

The English musician Peter Gabriel issued in 2000 The Story of OVO which was released in a CD-booklet-shaped comic book as part of the CD edition with the title &quot;OVO The Millennium Show&quot;. The story of the 2000 Millennium Dome Show based on it. The show opened on 1 January 2000 and was performed 999 times before closing on 31 December of that year. &quot;sponsored by Walt Disney World&quot;.

=== Exhibits ===

The interior space was subdivided into 14 &quot;zones&quot;: &quot;Who We Are&quot; (Body, Faith, Mind and Self-Portrait), &quot;What We Do&quot; (Work, Learning, Rest, Play, Talk, Money and Journey) and &quot;Where We Live&quot; (Shared Ground, Living Island and Home Planet).

Surrounded by the zones was a performance area in the centre of the dome. With music composed by Peter Gabriel and an acrobatic cast of 160, the Millennium Dome Show was performed 999 times over the course of the year. Throughout the year, the specially-commissioned film &quot;&quot; was shown in Skyscape (a separate cinema on the site sponsored by BSkyB). There was also the McDonald&#x27;s &quot;Our Town Story&quot; project in which each Local Education Authority in the UK was invited to perform a show of their devising which characterised their area and its people.

As well as the above, the first ever series of &quot;Techno Games&quot; was filmed there and shown on BBC Two the same year.

=== Other attractions ===
There were a number of other attractions both in and outside of The Dome. Inside the Dome there was a play area named Timekeepers of the Millennium (featuring the characters Coggsley and Sprinx), The Millennium Coin Minting Press in association with the Royal Mint, the 1951 Festival of Britain Bus, and the Millennium Star Jewels (focus of the failed Millennium Diamond heist.) Outside was the Millennium Map (thirteen metres; 43&#x27; high), the Childhood Cube, &quot;Looking Around&quot; (a hidden installation), Greenwich Pavilion, the Hanging Gardens at the front of the Dome, as well as a number of other art installations and sculptures.

Two of the remaining art installations form the start of The Line, a modern art trail connecting the O2 to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.

=== Financial and management problems ===
The project was largely reported by the press to have been a failure. During 2000, the organisers repeatedly asked for, and received, more cash from the Millennium Commission, the Lottery body which supported it. There where numerous changes at management and board level, before and during the exhibition; Jennifer Page was sacked as chief executive of the New Millennium Experience Company just one month after the dome&#x27;s opening. The project came to be seen as closely aligned with Tony Blair&#x27;s New Labour, making its success or failure politically important. Part of the problem was that the financial predictions were based on an unrealistically high forecast of visitor numbers at 12 million. During the first year that it was open there were approximately 6.5 million visitors – significantly fewer than the approximately 10 million paying visitors that attended the Festival of Britain, which only ran from May to September. Empire Exhibition, Scotland 1938, held in Glasgow, attracted more than 12 million visitors, being open May to October. Unlike the press, visitor feedback was positive; as of August 2000, 87% of visitors said they were satisfied with their visit. It was the most popular admission-paying tourist attraction in 2000, with almost twice as many visitors as the second most visited attraction, Alton Towers.

According to the UK National Audit Office, the cost of The Dome at the liquidation of the New Millennium Experience Company in 2002 was £789 million, of which £628 million was covered by National Lottery grants and £189 million through sales of tickets etc. A surplus of £25 million over costs meant that the full lottery grant was not required. The £603 million of lottery money was still £204 million in excess of the original estimate of £399 million required, due to the shortfall in visitor numbers.

== Closure and sale of site ==
The government&#x27;s difficulties in selling the site became the subject of much critical comment. The amount spent on maintaining the closed building was also criticised. Shortly after it had closed, Lord Falconer reported that The Dome was costing over £1 million per month to maintain.

Following closure of the Dome, some Zones were dismantled by the sponsoring organisations, but much of the content was auctioned or donated to Disney World. This included a number of artworks specially commissioned from contemporary British artists. A piece by Gavin Turk was sold for far below his auction price, though Turk stated that he did not think the piece had worked. The Timekeepers of the Millennium attraction was acquired by the Chessington World of Adventures theme park in Surrey. A unique record of the memorabilia and paraphernalia of the Millennium Experience is held by a private collector in the United States. Many of the fixtures and fittings were also purchased by Paul Scally, chairman of Gillingham F.C., for the club&#x27;s stadium.

== Temporary reopenings ==
The Dome opened again during December 2003 for the &quot;Winter Wonderland 2003&quot; experience. The event, which featured a large funfair, ice rink, and other attractions, culminated in a laser and firework display on New Year&#x27;s Eve. It also served as the venue for a number of free music festivals organised by the Mayor of London under the &quot;Respect&quot; banner.

Over the 2004 Christmas period, part of the main dome was used as a shelter for the homeless and others in need, organised by the charity Crisis after superseding the London Arena, which had previously hosted the event. In 2005, when work began for the redevelopment of the Dome, the London Arena hosted the event again.

== Redevelopment and rebranding as The O2 ==
By late 2000, a proposal had been made for a high-tech business park to be erected under the tent area, creating an &quot;indoor city&quot; complete with streets, parks, and buildings. The business park was actually the original 1996 proposal for the site of the peninsula before the plans for the Millennium Dome were proposed.

A suggestion was also made that the entire Dome be relocated to Swindon to serve as a research centre and extension of the Science Museum; this proposal only came to light when released by The National Archives in 2022.

In December 2001, it was announced that Meridian Delta Ltd had been chosen by the government to develop the Dome as a sports and entertainment centre, and to develop housing, shops and offices on of surrounding land. It also hoped to relocate some of London&#x27;s tertiary education establishments to the site. Meridian Delta is backed by the American billionaire Philip Anschutz, who has interests in oil, railways, and telecommunications, as well as a string of sports-related investments.

A report in 2005 by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee found that the cost of the process of selling the Dome and surrounding land (which increased to 170 acres from the initial offering of the 48 acres enclosed by the Dome) and managing the Dome until the deal was closed was £28.7 million. £33 million were expected to be returned to the taxpayer by 2009. The value of the 48 acres occupied by the Dome was estimated at £48 million, which could have been realised by demolishing the structure, but it was considered preferable to preserve the Dome.

The dome was publicly renamed as The O2 on 31 May 2005, in a £6 million-per-year deal with telecommunications company O2 plc, now a subsidiary of Telefónica Europe. This announcement, which presaged a major redevelopment of the site that retained little beyond the shell of the dome, gave publicity to the dome&#x27;s transition into an entertainment district including an indoor arena, a music club, a cinema, an exhibition space and bars and restaurants. This redevelopment was undertaken by the dome&#x27;s new owners, the Anschutz Entertainment Group, to a design by HOK SVE and Buro Happold. It cost £600 million, and the resulting venue opened to the public on 24 June 2007, with a concert by rock band Bon Jovi.

During the 2012 Summer Olympics, the artistic gymnastics events, along with the medal rounds of basketball, were held at The O2. It also held wheelchair basketball events during the 2012 Summer Paralympics. For sponsorship reasons, during those times the arena was temporarily renamed the North Greenwich Arena.

The O2 now contains multiple VR theme park rides, a trampoline park, and an attraction called &quot;Up at The O2,&quot; offering guided climbs on the O2 arena.

==Effects on political careers==

Issues related to the Dome damaged the political careers of government ministers Peter Mandelson and John Prescott. The scheme was seen as an early example of what some saw as Tony Blair&#x27;s often excessive optimism, who stated at the Dome&#x27;s opening: &quot;In the Dome we have a creation that, I believe, will truly be a beacon to the world&quot;. The fact that Mandelson&#x27;s grandfather was Herbert Morrison—who as a minister had been involved with the Festival of Britain—was often drawn on for negative comparisons.

== Chronology of the project ==
*1994: Millennium Commission established by Prime Minister John Major and handed over to Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine.
*1 March 1995: chief executive Jennie Page appointed.
*19 June 1996: Greenwich Peninsula site selected over Birmingham by the Millennium Commission. The Birmingham NEC, Pride Park in Derby and Bromley-by-Bow in East London were the other locations on the final short list.
*December 1996: Government decides to support the project with public money after being unable to raise private capital.
*19 June 1997: New Prime Minister Tony Blair visits Greenwich to announce that the Millennium Dome has been saved. The decision was taken only after a difficult Cabinet debate which lasted for more than an hour.
*20 June 1997: Tony Blair appointed Peter Mandelson to the role of Minister for the Millennium after his announcement that the beleaguered £580 million dome would go ahead.
*June 1997: Construction begins.
*10 January 1998: Creative director Stephen Bayley quits the project. He is said to have been at &quot;loggerheads&quot; with Peter Mandelson as to who was in charge with the project.
*23 December 1998: Peter Mandelson resigns from government after a financial scandal.
*4 January 1999: Lord Falconer of Thoroton replaces Mandelson.
*May 1999: The Jubilee Line Extension opens, putting the Dome on the London Underground. This too is seen as disorderly, opening 14 months late and with station facilities not yet complete (e.g. lifts for wheelchair access).
*22 June 1999: structure of Dome completed.
*31 December 1999: the BBC Balloon is seen flying during &quot;2000 Today&quot; on BBC One, and used throughout 2000.
*31 December 1999 and 1 January 2000: VIP guests are kept waiting outside for hours because of a ticketing problem.

==In popular culture==

* Within the foundations of the Dome in 1998, a time capsule was buried by Katy Hill and Richard Bacon, two of the then-current presenters of the long running BBC children&#x27;s programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot;. The capsule was due to be opened in 2050, but was accidentally unearthed and damaged in 2017 during construction work. It was originally intended to be reburied once it had been repaired, but was instead opened and its contents taken on a tour of the UK. It was subsequently stored in the National Archives until 2050 alongside a new Diamond Time Capsule celebrating the show&#x27;s 60th anniversary.
* The song &quot;Silvertown Blues&quot; from Mark Knopfler&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Sailing to Philadelphia&quot; deals with the construction of The Dome.
* Two books about the attempted robbery of the De Beers diamonds from the Dome were published in 2004: &quot;Diamond Geezers – The Inside Story of the Crime of the Millennium&quot; () written by Kris Hollington, published by Michael O&#x27;Mara Books Ltd, and &quot;Dome Raiders – How Scotland Yard Foiled the Greatest Robbery of All Time&quot; () written by Jon Shatford and William Doyle, published by Virgin Books.
* In 2005, the Dome was featured in a task on &quot;The Amazing Race 7&quot;, in which contestants had to drive an AEC Routemaster double-decker bus through the structure&#x27;s car park.
* &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Daughter&quot; is a 2006 BBC television drama written and directed by Stephen Poliakoff, stars Bill Nighy as a publicist working to promote the Dome in the run-up to its grand opening. Emily Blunt plays the titular daughter who is disdainful of the project, while Miranda Richardson plays Gideon&#x27;s love interest whose simple observations about his life – and the Dome – reshape Gideon&#x27;s life. Both Nighy and Blunt received Golden Globe Awards for their performances. The show won a Peabody Award in April 2007.
* The Millennium Dome was prominently featured in the pre-title sequence of the 1999 &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;. Bond falls down the outside of the Dome when pursuing a target, injuring his shoulder in the process.

<doc id="39764" wikidata="Q2105" url="?curid=39764" title="Jacques Chirac">
<text>Jacques René Chirac (, ; ; 29 November 193226 September 2019) was a French politician who served as President of France from 1995 to 2007. He was previously Prime Minister of France from 1974 to 1976 and 1986 to 1988, as well as Mayor of Paris from 1977 to 1995.

After attending the , Chirac began his career as a high-level civil servant, entering politics shortly thereafter. Chirac occupied various senior positions, including minister of agriculture and minister of the interior. In 1981 and 1988, he unsuccessfully ran for president as the standard-bearer for the conservative Gaullist party Rally for the Republic (RPR). Chirac&#x27;s internal policies initially included lower tax rates, the removal of price controls, strong punishment for crime and terrorism, and business privatisation.

After pursuing these policies in his second term as prime minister, Chirac changed his views. He argued for different economic policies and was elected president in 1995, with 52.6% of the vote in the second round, beating Socialist Lionel Jospin, after campaigning on a platform of healing the &quot;social rift&quot; (). Chirac&#x27;s economic policies, based on dirigisme, allowing for state-directed investment, stood in opposition to the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; policies of the United Kingdom under the ministries of Margaret Thatcher and John Major, which Chirac described as &quot;Anglo-Saxon ultraliberalism&quot;.

Chirac was known for his stand against the American-led invasion of Iraq, his recognition of the collaborationist French government&#x27;s role in deporting Jews, and his reduction of the presidential term from seven years to five through a referendum in 2000. At the 2002 presidential election, he won 82.2% of the vote in the second round against the far-right candidate, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and was the last president to be re-elected until 2022. In 2011, the Paris court declared Chirac guilty of diverting public funds and abusing public confidence, giving him a two-year suspended prison sentence.

According to Chirac, his name &quot;originates from the , that of the troubadours, therefore that of poetry&quot;. He was a Catholic.

Chirac was an only child (his elder sister, Jacqueline, died in infancy nearly ten years before his birth). He was educated in Paris at the , a private school. He then attended the and the . After his , behind his father&#x27;s back he went off to serve for three months as a sailor on a coal-transport.

Chirac played rugby union for Brive&#x27;s youth team, and also played at university level. He played no. 8 and second row. At age 18, his ambition was to become a ship&#x27;s captain.

=== Education and early career ===
At age 16, Chirac wanted to learn Sanskrit and found a White Russian Sanskrit teacher in Paris who ended up teaching him Russian; by age 17 Chirac was almost fluent in Russian. Inspired by Charles de Gaulle, Chirac started to pursue a civil service career in the 1950s. During this period, he joined the French Communist Party, sold copies of , and took part in meetings of a communist cell. In 1950, he signed the Soviet-inspired Stockholm Appeal for the abolition of nuclear weapons – which led him to be questioned when he applied for his first visa to the United States.

In 1953, after graduating from the , he attended a non-credit course at Harvard University&#x27;s summer school, before entering the , which trains France&#x27;s top civil servants, in 1957.

In the United States, Chirac worked at Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis, Missouri.

Chirac trained as a reserve military officer in armoured cavalry at Saumur. He then volunteered to fight in the Algerian War, using personal connections to be sent despite the reservations of his superiors. His superiors did not want to make him an officer because they suspected he had communist leanings. In 1965, he became an auditor in the Court of Auditors.

== Early political career ==
=== The &quot;Bulldozer&quot;: 1962–1971 ===
In April 1962, Chirac was appointed head of the personal staff of Prime Minister Georges Pompidou. This appointment launched Chirac&#x27;s political career. Pompidou considered Chirac his protégé, and referred to him as &quot;my bulldozer&quot; for his skill at getting things done. The nickname caught on in French political circles, where it also referred to his abrasive manner. As late as the 1988 presidential election, Chirac maintained this reputation.

At Pompidou&#x27;s suggestion, Chirac ran as a Gaullist for a seat in the National Assembly in 1967. He was elected deputy for his home Corrèze , a stronghold of the left. This surprising victory in the context of a Gaullist ebb permitted him to enter the government as Minister of Social Affairs. Although Chirac was well-situated in de Gaulle&#x27;s entourage, being related by marriage to the general&#x27;s sole companion at the time of the Appeal of 18 June 1940, he was more of a &quot;Pompidolian&quot; than a &quot;Gaullist&quot;. When student and worker unrest rocked France in May 1968, Chirac played a central role in negotiating a truce. Subsequently, as state secretary of economy (1968–1971), he worked closely with Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, who headed the ministry of economy and finance.

=== Cabinet minister: 1971–1974 ===
After some months in the ministry for Relations with Parliament, Chirac&#x27;s first high-level post came in 1972 when he became Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development under Pompidou, who had been elected president in 1969, after de Gaulle retired. Chirac quickly earned a reputation as a champion of French farmers&#x27; interests, and first attracted international attention when he assailed U.S., West German, and European Commission agricultural policies which conflicted with French interests.

On 27 February 1974, after the resignation of Raymond Marcellin, Chirac was appointed Minister of the Interior. On 21 March 1974, he cancelled the SAFARI project due to privacy concerns after its existence was revealed by . From March 1974, he was entrusted by President Pompidou with preparations for the presidential election then scheduled for 1976. These elections were moved forward because of Pompidou&#x27;s sudden death on 2 April 1974.

Chirac vainly attempted to rally Gaullists behind Prime Minister Pierre Messmer. Jacques Chaban-Delmas announced his candidacy in spite of the disapproval of the &quot;Pompidolians&quot;. Chirac and others published the &quot;call of the 43&quot; in favour of Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, the leader of the non-Gaullist part of the parliamentary majority. Giscard d&#x27;Estaing was elected as Pompidou&#x27;s successor after France&#x27;s most competitive election campaign in years. In return, the new president chose Chirac to lead the cabinet.

=== Prime Minister of Giscard: 1974–1976 ===

When Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing became president, he nominated Chirac as prime minister on 27 May 1974, to reconcile the &quot;Giscardian&quot; and &quot;non-Giscardian&quot; factions of the parliamentary majority. At the age of 41, Chirac stood out as the very model of the (&#x27;young wolves&#x27;) of French politics, but he was faced with the hostility of the &quot;Barons of Gaullism&quot; who considered him a traitor for his role during the previous presidential campaign. In December 1974, he took the lead of the Union of Democrats for the Republic (UDR) against the will of its more senior personalities.

As prime minister, Chirac quickly set about persuading the Gaullists that, despite the social reforms proposed by President Giscard, the basic tenets of Gaullism, such as national and European independence, would be retained. Chirac was advised by Pierre Juillet and Marie-France Garaud, two former advisers of Pompidou. These two organised the campaign against Chaban-Delmas in 1974. They advocated a clash with Giscard d&#x27;Estaing because they thought his policy bewildered the conservative electorate.

Citing Giscard&#x27;s unwillingness to give him authority, Chirac resigned as prime minister in 1976. He proceeded to build up his political base among France&#x27;s several conservative parties, with a goal of reconstituting the Gaullist UDR into a Neo-Gaullist group, the Rally for the Republic (RPR). Chirac&#x27;s first tenure as prime minister was also an arguably progressive one, with improvements in both the minimum wage and the social welfare system carried out during the course of his premiership.

=== Mayor of Paris: 1977–1995 ===
After his departure from the cabinet, Chirac wanted to gain the leadership of the political right, to gain the French presidency in the future. The RPR was conceived as an electoral machine against President Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. Paradoxically, Chirac benefited from Giscard&#x27;s decision to create the office of mayor in Paris, which had been in abeyance since the 1871 Commune, because the leaders of the Third Republic (1871–1940) feared that having municipal control of the capital would give the mayor too much power. In 1977, Chirac stood as a candidate against Michel d&#x27;Ornano, a close friend of the president, and won. As mayor of Paris, Chirac&#x27;s political influence grew. He held this post until 1995.

Chirac supporters point out that, as mayor, he provided programmes to help the elderly, people with disabilities, and single mothers, and introduced the street-cleaning Motocrotte, while providing incentives for businesses to stay in Paris. His opponents contend that he installed &quot;clientelist&quot; policies.

== Governmental opposition ==
=== Struggle for the right-wing leadership: 1976–1986 ===

In 1978, Chirac attacked Giscard&#x27;s pro-European policy and made a nationalist turn with the December 1978 Call of Cochin, initiated by his counsellors Marie-France Garaud and , which had first been called by Pompidou. Hospitalised in after a car crash, he declared that &quot;as always about the drooping of France, the pro-foreign party acts with its peaceable and reassuring voice&quot;. He appointed Yvan Blot, an intellectual who would later join the National Front, as director of his campaigns for the 1979 European election.

After the poor results of the election, Chirac broke with Garaud and Juillet. Vexed Marie-France Garaud stated: &quot;We thought Chirac was made of the same marble of which statues are carved in, we perceive he&#x27;s of the same faience bidets are made of.&quot; His rivalry with Giscard d&#x27;Estaing intensified.

Chirac made his first run for president against Giscard d&#x27;Estaing in the 1981 election, thus splitting the centre-right vote. He was eliminated in the first round with 18% of the vote. He reluctantly supported Giscard in the second round. He refused to give instructions to the RPR voters but said that he supported the incumbent president &quot;in a private capacity&quot;, which was interpreted as almost &quot;de facto&quot; support of the Socialist Party&#x27;s (PS) candidate, François Mitterrand, who was elected by a broad majority.

Giscard has always blamed Chirac for his defeat. He was told by Mitterrand, before his death, that the latter had dined with Chirac before the election. Chirac told the Socialist candidate that he wanted to &quot;get rid of Giscard&quot;. In his memoirs, Giscard wrote that between the two rounds, he phoned the RPR headquarters. He passed himself off, as a right-wing voter, by changing his voice. The RPR employee advised him &quot;certainly do not vote Giscard!&quot; After 1981, the relationship between the two men became tense, with Giscard, even though he had been in the same government coalition as Chirac, criticising Chirac&#x27;s actions openly.

After the May 1981 presidential election, the right also lost the subsequent legislative election that year. However, as Giscard had been knocked out, Chirac appeared as the principal leader of the right-wing opposition. Due to his attacks against the economic policy of the Socialist government, he gradually aligned himself with prevailing economically liberal opinion, even though it did not correspond with Gaullist doctrine. While the far-right National Front grew, taking advantage of the proportional representation electoral system which had been introduced for the 1986 legislative elections, he signed an electoral pact with the Giscardian (and more or less Christian Democratic) party Union for French Democracy (UDF).

=== Prime Minister of Mitterrand: 1986–1988 ===

When the RPR/UDF right-wing coalition won a slight majority in the National Assembly in the 1986 election, Mitterrand (PS) appointed Chirac prime minister (though many in Mitterrand&#x27;s inner circle lobbied him to choose Jacques Chaban-Delmas instead). This unprecedented power-sharing arrangement, known as cohabitation, gave Chirac the lead in domestic affairs. However, it is generally conceded that Mitterrand used the areas granted to the President of the Republic, or &quot;reserved domains&quot; of the Presidency, Defence and Foreign Affairs, to belittle his prime minister.

Chirac&#x27;s cabinet sold many public companies, renewing the liberalisation initiated under Laurent Fabius&#x27;s Socialist government of 1984–1986, and abolished the solidarity tax on wealth (ISF), a symbolic tax on those with high value assets introduced by Mitterrand&#x27;s government. Elsewhere, the plan for university reform (plan Devaquet) caused a crisis in 1986 when a student called Malik Oussekine was killed by the police, leading to massive demonstrations and the proposal&#x27;s withdrawal. It has been said during other student crises that this event strongly affected Jacques Chirac, who was afterwards careful about possible police violence during such demonstrations (e.g., maybe explaining part of the decision to &quot;promulgate without applying&quot; the First Employment Contract (CPE) after large student demonstrations against it).

One of his first acts concerning foreign policy was to call back Jacques Foccart (1913–1997), who had been de Gaulle&#x27;s and his successors&#x27; leading counsellor for African matters, called by journalist Stephen Smith the &quot;father of all &quot;networks&quot; on the continent, at the time [in 1986] aged 72.&quot; Foccart, who had also co-founded the Gaullist SAC militia (dissolved by Mitterrand in 1982 after the Auriol massacre) along with Charles Pasqua, and who was a key component of the system, was again called to the Elysée Palace when Chirac won the 1995 presidential election. Furthermore, confronted by anti-colonialist movements in New Caledonia, Prime Minister Chirac ordered a military intervention against the separatists in the Ouvéa cave, leading to the deaths of 19 militants. He allegedly refused any alliance with Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s .

=== Crossing the desert: 1988–1995 ===
Chirac ran against Mitterrand for a second time in the 1988 election. He obtained 20 per cent of the vote in the first round, but lost the second with only 46 per cent. He resigned from the cabinet and the right lost the next legislative election.

For the first time, his leadership over the RPR was challenged. Charles Pasqua and Philippe Séguin criticised his abandonment of Gaullist doctrines. On the right, a new generation of politicians, the &quot;renovation men&quot;, accused Chirac and Giscard of being responsible for the electoral defeats. In 1992, convinced a candidate could not become president whilst advocating anti-European policies, he called for a &quot;yes&quot; vote in the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, against the opinion of Pasqua, Séguin and a majority of the RPR voters, who chose to vote &quot;no&quot;.

While he still was mayor of Paris (since 1977), Chirac went to Abidjan ( where he supported President Houphouët-Boigny (1960–1993), although the latter was being called a &quot;thief&quot; by the local population. Chirac then declared that multipartism was a &quot;kind of luxury&quot;.

Nevertheless, the right won the 1993 legislative election. Chirac announced that he did not want to come back as prime minister as his previous term had ended with his unsuccessful run for the presidency against Mitterrand who was still president at this point.

Chirac instead suggested the appointment of Edouard Balladur, who had promised that he would not run for the presidency against Chirac in 1995. However, benefiting from positive polls, Balladur decided to be a presidential candidate, with the support of a majority of right-wing politicians. Balladur broke from Chirac along with a number of friends and allies, including Charles Pasqua, Nicolas Sarkozy, etc., who supported his candidacy. A small group of would remain with Chirac, including Alain Juppé and Jean-Louis Debré. When Nicolas Sarkozy became president in 2007, Juppé was one of the few to serve in François Fillon&#x27;s government.

== Presidency (1995–2007) ==

=== First term: 1995–2002 ===
==== Juppé ministry ====
During the 1995 presidential campaign, Chirac criticised the &quot;sole thought&quot; ( of neoliberalism represented by his challenger on the right and promised to reduce the &quot;social fracture&quot;, placing himself more to the centre and thus forcing Balladur to radicalise himself. Ultimately, he obtained more votes than Balladur in the first round (20.8 per cent), and then defeated the Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin in the second round (52.6 per cent).

Chirac was elected on a platform of tax cuts and job programmes, but his policies did little to ease the labour strikes during his first months in office. On the domestic front, neo-liberal economic austerity measures introduced by Chirac and his conservative prime minister Alain Juppé, including budgetary cutbacks, proved highly unpopular. At about the same time, it became apparent that Juppé and others had obtained preferential conditions for public housing, as well as other perks. At the year&#x27;s end Chirac faced major workers&#x27; strikes which turned, in November–December 1995, into a general strike, one of the largest since May 1968. The demonstrations were largely pitted against Juppé&#x27;s plan for pension reform, and ultimately led to his dismissal.

Shortly after taking office, Chiracundaunted by international protests by environmental groupsinsisted upon the resumption of nuclear tests at Mururoa Atoll in French Polynesia in 1995, a few months before signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Reacting to criticism, Chirac said, &quot;You only have to look back at 1935...There were people then who were against France arming itself, and look what happened.&quot; On 1 February 1996, Chirac announced that France had ended &quot;once and for all&quot; its nuclear testing and intended to accede to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

Elected as President of the Republic, he refused to discuss the existence of French military bases in Africa, despite requests by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The French Army thus remained in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire as well as in Omar Bongo&#x27;s Gabon.

==== State responsibility for the roundup of Jews ====

Prior to 1995, the French government had maintained that the French Republic had been dismantled when Philippe Pétain instituted a new French State during World War II and that the Republic had been re-established when the war was over. It was not for France, therefore, to apologise for the roundup of Jews for deportation that happened while the Republic had not existed and was carried out by a state, Vichy France, which it did not recognise. President François Mitterrand had reiterated this position: &quot;The Republic had nothing to do with this. I do not believe France is responsible,&quot; he said in September 1994.

Chirac was the first president of France to take responsibility for the deportation of Jews during the Vichy regime. In a speech made on 16 July 1995 at the site of the Vel&#x27; d&#x27;Hiv Roundup, where 13,000 Jews had been held for deportation to concentration camps in July 1942, Chirac said, &quot;France, on that day, committed the irreparable&quot;. Those responsible for the roundup were &quot;4,500 policemen and gendarmes, French, under the authority of their leaders [who] obeyed the demands of the Nazis. ... the criminal folly of the occupiers was seconded by the French, by the French State&quot;.

==== &quot;Cohabitation&quot; with Jospin ====
In 1997, Chirac dissolved parliament for early legislative elections in a gamble designed to bolster support for his conservative economic program. But instead, it created an uproar, and his power was weakened by the subsequent backlash. The Socialist Party (PS), joined by other parties on the left, soundly defeated Chirac&#x27;s conservative allies, forcing Chirac into a new period of cohabitation with Jospin as prime minister (1997–2002), which lasted five years.

Cohabitation significantly weakened the power of Chirac&#x27;s presidency. The French president, by a constitutional convention, only controls foreign and military policy— and even then, allocation of funding is under the control of Parliament and under the significant influence of the prime minister. Short of dissolving parliament and calling for new elections, the president was left with little power to influence public policy regarding crime, the economy, and public services. Chirac seized the occasion to periodically criticise Jospin&#x27;s government.

His position was weakened by scandals about the financing of RPR by Paris municipality. In 2001, the left, represented by Bertrand Delanoë (PS), won a majority on the city council of the capital. Jean Tiberi, Chirac&#x27;s successor at the Paris city hall, was forced to resign after having been put under investigations in June 1999 on charges of in the HLMs of Paris affairs (related to the illegal financing of the RPR). Tiberi was finally expelled from the Rally for the Republic, Chirac&#x27;s party, on 12 October 2000, declaring to the magazine on 18 November 2000: &quot;Jacques Chirac is not my friend anymore&quot;.

After the publication of the Jean-Claude Méry by on 22 September 2000, in which Jean-Claude Méry, in charge of the RPR&#x27;s financing, directly accused Chirac of organising the network, and of having been physically present on 5 October 1986, when Méry gave in cash 5 million Francs, which came from companies who had benefited from state deals, to Michel Roussin, personal secretary ( of Chirac, Chirac refused to attend court in response to his summons by judge Eric Halphen, and the highest echelons of the French justice system declared that he could not be inculpated while in office.

During his two terms, he increased the Elysee Palace&#x27;s total budget by 105 per cent (to €90 million, whereas 20 years before it was the equivalent of €43.7 million). He doubled the number of presidential cars – to 61 cars and seven scooters in the Palace&#x27;s garage. He hired 145 extra employees – the total number of the people he employed simultaneously was 963.

==== Defence policy ====
As the Supreme Commander of the French armed forces, he reduced the military budget, as did his predecessor. At the end of his first term it accounted for three per cent of GDP. In 1997 the aircraft carrier &quot;Clemenceau&quot; was decommissioned after 37 years of service, with her sister ship &quot;Foch&quot; decommissioned in 2000 after 37 years of service, leaving the French Navy with no aircraft carrier until 2001, when &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; was commissioned. He also reduced expenditure on nuclear weapons and the French nuclear arsenal was reduced to include 350 warheads, compared to the Russian nuclear arsenal of 16,000 warheads. He also published a plan to reduce the number of fighters the French military had by 30.

After François Mitterrand left office in 1995, Chirac began a rapprochement with NATO by joining the Military Committee and attempting to negotiate a return to the integrated military command, which failed after the French demand for parity with the United States went unmet. The possibility of a further attempt foundered after Chirac was forced into cohabitation with a Socialist-led cabinet between 1997 and 2002, then poor Franco-American relations after the French UN veto threat over Iraq in 2003 made transatlantic negotiations impossible.

==== Close call ====
On 25 July 2000, as Chirac and the first lady were returning from the G7 Summit in Okinawa, Japan, they were placed in a dangerous situation by Air France Flight 4590 after they landed at Charles de Gaulle International Airport. The first couple were in an Air France Boeing 747 taxiing toward the terminal when the jet had to stop and wait for Flight 4590 to take off. The departing plane, an Aérospatiale-BAC Concorde, ran over a strip of metal on takeoff puncturing its left fuel tank and sliced electrical wires near the left landing gear. The sequence of events ignited a large fire and caused the Concorde to veer left on its takeoff roll. As it reached takeoff speed and lifted off the ground, it came within 30 feet of hitting Chirac&#x27;s 747. The photograph of Flight 4590 ablaze, the only picture taken of the Concorde on fire, was taken by passenger Toshihiko Sato on Chirac&#x27;s jetliner.

=== Second term: 2002–2007 ===

At the age of 69, Chirac faced his fourth presidential campaign in 2002. He received 20% of the vote in the first ballot of the presidential elections in April 2002. It had been expected that he would face incumbent prime minister Lionel Jospin (PS) in the second round of elections; instead, Chirac faced far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen of the National Front (FN), who came in 200,000 votes ahead of Jospin. All parties other than the National Front (except for ) called for opposing Le Pen, even if it meant voting for Chirac. The 14-day period between the two rounds of voting was marked by demonstrations against Le Pen and slogans such as &quot;Vote for the crook, not for the fascist&quot; or &quot;Vote with a clothespin on your nose&quot;. Chirac won re-election by a landslide, with 82 per cent of the vote on the second ballot. However, Chirac became increasingly unpopular during his second term. According to a July 2005 poll, 37 per cent judged Chirac favourably and 63 per cent unfavorably. In 2006, &quot;The Economist&quot; wrote that Chirac &quot;is the most unpopular occupant of the Elysée Palace in the fifth republic&#x27;s history.&quot;

==== Early term ====
As the left-wing Socialist Party was in thorough disarray following Jospin&#x27;s defeat, Chirac reorganised politics on the right, establishing a new party – initially called the Union of the Presidential Majority, then the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). The RPR had broken down; a number of members had formed Eurosceptic breakaways. While the Giscardian liberals of the Union for French Democracy (UDF) had moved to the right, the UMP won the parliamentary elections that followed the presidential poll with ease.

During an official visit to Madagascar on 21 July 2005, Chirac described the repression of the 1947 Malagasy uprising, which left between 80,000 and 90,000 dead, as &quot;unacceptable&quot;.

Despite past opposition to state intervention the Chirac government approved a €2.8 billion aid package to troubled manufacturing giant Alstom. In October 2004, Chirac signed a trade agreement with PRC president Hu Jintao where Alstom was given €1 billion in contracts and promises of future investment in China.

==== Assassination attempt ====
On 14 July 2002, during Bastille Day celebrations, Chirac survived an assassination attempt by a lone gunman with a rifle hidden in a guitar case. The would-be assassin fired a shot toward the presidential motorcade, before being overpowered by bystanders. The gunman, Maxime Brunerie, underwent psychiatric testing; the violent far-right group with which he was associated, , was thence administratively dissolved.

==== Foreign policy ====
Along with Vladimir Putin (whom he called &quot;a personal friend&quot;), Hu Jintao, and Gerhard Schröder, Chirac emerged as a leading voice against George W. Bush and Tony Blair in 2003 during the organisation and deployment of American and British forces participating in a military coalition to forcibly remove the government of Iraq controlled by the Ba&#x27;ath Party under the leadership of Saddam Hussein that resulted in the 2003–2011 Iraq War.

Despite British and American pressure, Chirac threatened to veto, at that given point, a resolution in the UN Security Council that would authorise the use of military force to rid Iraq of alleged weapons of mass destruction, and rallied other governments to his position. &quot;Iraq today does not represent an immediate threat that justifies an immediate war&quot;, Chirac said on 18 March 2003. Future prime minister Dominique de Villepin acquired much of his popularity for his speech against the war at the United Nations (UN).

After Togo&#x27;s leader Gnassingbé Eyadéma&#x27;s death on 5 February 2005, Chirac gave him tribute and supported his son, Faure Gnassingbé, who has since succeeded his father.

On 19 January 2006, Chirac said that France was prepared to launch a nuclear strike against any country that sponsors a terrorist attack against French interests. He said his country&#x27;s nuclear arsenal had been reconfigured to include the ability to make a tactical strike in retaliation for terrorism.

Chirac criticised the Israeli offensive into Lebanon on 14 July 2006. However, Israeli Army Radio later reported that Chirac had secretly told Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert that France would support an Israeli invasion of Syria and the overthrow of the government of President Bashar al-Assad, promising to veto any moves against Israel in the United Nations or European Union. Whereas the disagreement on Iraq had caused a rift between Paris and Washington, recent analysis suggests that both governments worked closely together on the Syria file to end the Syrian occupation of Lebanon, and that Chirac was a driver of this diplomatic cooperation.

In July 2006, the G8 met to discuss international energy concerns. Despite the rising awareness of global warming issues, the G8 focused on &quot;energy security&quot; issues. Chirac continued to be the voice within the G8 summit meetings to support international action to curb global warming and climate change concerns. Chirac warned that &quot;humanity is dancing on a volcano&quot; and called for serious action by the world&#x27;s leading industrialised nations.

After Chirac&#x27;s death in 2019, the street leading to the Louvre Abu Dhabi was named Jacques Chirac Street in November 2019 in celebration of Chirac&#x27;s efforts to bolster links between France and the United Arab Emirates during his presidency.

Chirac espoused a staunchly pro-Moroccan policy, and the already established pro-Moroccan French stances vis-à-vis the Western Sahara conflict were strengthened during his presidential tenure.

==== Flight tax ====
Chirac requested the &quot;Landau-report&quot; (published in September 2004) and combined with the &quot;Report of the Technical Group on Innovative Financing Mechanisms&quot; formulated upon request by the Heads of State of Brazil, Chile, France and Spain (issued in December 2004), these documents present various opportunities for innovative financing mechanisms while equally stressing the advantages (stability and predictability) of tax-based models. The UNITAID project was born. Today the organisation&#x27;s executive board is chaired by Marisol Touraine.

==== 2005 referendum on TCE ====

On 29 May 2005, a referendum was held in France to decide whether the country should ratify the proposed treaty for a Constitution of the European Union (TCE). The result was a victory for the No campaign, with 55 per cent of voters rejecting the treaty on a turnout of 69 per cent, dealing a devastating blow to Chirac and the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party, and to part of the centre-left which had supported the TCE. Following the referendum defeat, Chirac replaced his prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin with Dominique de Villepin. In an address to the nation, Chirac declared that the new cabinet&#x27;s top priority was to curb unemployment, which was consistently hovering above 10 per cent, calling for a &quot;national mobilisation&quot; to that effect.

==== 2005 civil unrest and CPE protests ====

Following major student protests in spring 2006, which followed civil unrest in autumn 2005 after the death of two young boys in Clichy-sous-Bois, one of the poorest communes in Paris&#x27; suburbs, Chirac retracted the proposed First Employment Contract (CPE) by &quot;promulgating [it] without applying it&quot;, an unheard-of – and, some claim, illegal – move intended to appease the protesters while giving the appearance of not making a regarding the contract, and therefore to continue his support for his prime minister Dominique de Villepin.

==== Retirement ====
In early September 2005, Chirac suffered an event that his doctors described as a &quot;vascular incident&quot;. It was officially reported as a &quot;minor stroke&quot; or a mild stroke (also known as a transient ischemic attack). He recovered and returned to his duties soon afterward.

In a pre-recorded television broadcast aired on 11 March 2007, he announced, in a widely predicted move, that he would not choose to seek a third term as president. (In 2000 the constitution had been amended to reduce the length of the presidential term to five years, so his second term was shorter than his first.) &quot;My whole life has been committed to serving France, and serving peace&quot;, Chirac said, adding that he would find new ways to serve France after leaving office. He did not explain the reasons for his decision. He did not, during the broadcast, endorse any of the candidates running for election, but did devote several minutes of his talk to a plea against extremist politics that was considered a thinly disguised invocation to voters not to vote for Jean-Marie Le Pen and a recommendation to Nicolas Sarkozy not to orient his campaign so as to include themes traditionally associated with Le Pen.

== Post-presidency and death ==

Shortly after leaving office, he launched the Fondation Chirac in June 2008. Since then it has been striving for peace through five advocacy programmes: conflict prevention, access to water and sanitation, access to quality medicines and healthcare, access to land resources, and preservation of cultural diversity. It supports field projects that involve local people and provide concrete and innovative solutions. Chirac chaired the jury for the Prize for Conflict Prevention awarded every year by his foundation.

As a former president of France, he was entitled to a lifetime pension and personal security protection, and was an &quot;ex officio&quot; member for life of the Constitutional Council. He sat for the first time on the council on 15 November 2007, six months after leaving the presidency. Immediately after Sarkozy&#x27;s victory, Chirac moved into a duplex on the in Paris lent to him by the family of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri. During the Didier Schuller affair, the latter accused Hariri of having participated in illegal funding of the RPR&#x27;s political campaigns, but the judge closed the case without further investigations.

In Volume 2 of his memoirs published in June 2011, Chirac mocked his successor Nicolas Sarkozy as &quot;irritable, rash, impetuous, disloyal, ungrateful, and un-French&quot;. Chirac wrote that he considered firing Sarkozy previously, and conceded responsibility in allowing Jean-Marie Le Pen to advance in 2002. A poll conducted in 2010 suggested Chirac was the most admired political figure in France, while Sarkozy was 32nd.

On 11 April 2008, Chirac&#x27;s office announced that he had undergone successful surgery to fit a pacemaker.

Chirac suffered from frail health and memory loss in later life. In February 2014 he was admitted to hospital because of pains related to gout. On 10 December 2015, Chirac was hospitalised in Paris for undisclosed reasons, although his state of health did not &quot;give any cause for concern&quot;, he remained for about a week in ICU. According to his son-in-law Frederic Salat-Baroux, Chirac was again hospitalised in Paris with a lung infection on 18 September 2016.

===Death and state funeral===

Chirac died at his home in the 6th arrondissement of Paris on 26 September 2019, surrounded by his family. A requiem mass was held at Saint-Sulpice on 30 September, celebrated by Michel Aupetit, Archbishop of Paris, and attended by representatives from about 175 countries, included 69 past and present heads of state, government and international organisations. Notable names included António Guterres, Jean-Claude Juncker, Jens Stoltenberg, Vladimir Putin, Sergio Mattarella, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Charles Michel, Viktor Orbán, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Saad Hariri, Borut Pahor, Salome Zourabichvili, Tony Blair, Jean Chrétien, Vaira Vike-Freiberga, Bill Clinton, Hamid Karzai, Dai Bingguo plus many ministers.

The day was declared a national day of mourning in France and a minute of silence was held nationwide at 15:00. Following the public ceremony, Chirac was buried at Montparnasse Cemetery, with only close family in attendance. Andorra announced three days of national mourning. Lebanon declared the day of the ex-president&#x27;s funeral national day of mourning.

== Popular culture ==
Chirac was a major supporter of the nation&#x27;s film industry.

Because of Jacques Chirac&#x27;s long public career, he was often parodied or caricatured: Young Jacques Chirac is the basis of a young, dashing bureaucrat character in the 1976 Asterix comic strip album &quot;Obelix and Co.&quot;, proposing methods to quell Gallic unrest to elderly, old-style Roman politicians. Chirac was also featured in as an overexcited, jumpy character.

===A major fixture of the Guignols===
Jacques Chirac was a favourite character of , a satiric latex puppet show. He was originally portrayed as a rather likeable, though overexcited, character; following the corruption allegations, however, he was depicted as a kind of dilettante and incompetent who pilfered public money and lied through his teeth. His character for a while developed a superhero alter ego, (&#x27;super liar&#x27;) to get him out of embarrassing situations.

===Satirical songs===
In 1988, the band Parabellum lambasted Chirac in their song &quot;Anarchie en Chiraquie&quot; (&quot;anarchy in Chirac-land&quot;). In 1995, Zebda criticized Chirac&#x27;s declarations on the &quot;noise and smell&quot; of immigrant families.

Because of his alleged improprieties, Chirac was lambasted in a song (&#x27;Chirac in prison&#x27;) by French punk band , with a video clip made by the . Similarly, the band Sinsemilia lambasted Chirac in the song &quot;Bienvenue en Chiraquie&quot; (&quot;Welcome to Chirac-land&quot;) as being the leader of a political mafia behaving outside of the laws applicable to normal citizenry. In June 2005, the band attracted media controversy when, on live television during midday news, it stopped early playing the gentle &quot;Tout le bonheur du monde&quot; and instead started playing &quot;Bienvenue en Chiraquie&quot; as a political gesture, before being cut early.

===Ig Nobel===

He was given the Ig Nobel prize for peace, for commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of Hiroshima with atomic bomb tests in the Pacific (1996).

=== Portrayals in film ===

J. Grant Albrecht voices Chirac in the Oliver Stone film &quot;W.&quot; Marc Rioufol plays him in Richard Loncraine&#x27;s 2010 film &quot;The Special Relationship&quot;.

Bernard Le Coq portrays Chirac in and &quot;The Conquest&quot; by Xavier Durringer.

== Controversies ==

=== Osirak controversy ===
At the invitation of Saddam Hussein (then vice-president of Iraq, but &quot;de facto&quot; dictator), Chirac made an official visit to Baghdad in 1975. Hussein approved a deal granting French oil companies a number of privileges plus a 23-percent share of Iraqi oil. As part of this deal, France sold Iraq the Osirak MTR nuclear reactor, designed to test nuclear materials.

The Israeli Air Force alleged that the reactor&#x27;s imminent commissioning was a threat to its security, and pre-emptively bombed the Osirak reactor on 7 June 1981, provoking considerable anger from French officials and the United Nations Security Council.

The Osirak deal became a controversy again in 2002–2003, when an international military coalition led by the United States invaded Iraq and forcibly removed Hussein&#x27;s government from power. France led several other European countries in an effort to prevent the invasion. The Osirak deal was then used by parts of the American media to criticise the Chirac-led opposition to starting a war in Iraq, despite French involvement in the Gulf War.

=== Conviction for corruption ===
Chirac has been named in several cases of alleged corruption that occurred during his term as mayor, some of which have led to felony convictions of some politicians and aides. However, a controversial judicial decision in 1999 granted Chirac immunity while he was president of France. He refused to testify on these matters, arguing that it would be incompatible with his presidential functions. Investigations concerning the running of Paris&#x27;s city hall, the number of whose municipal employees increased by 25% from 1977 to 1995 (with 2,000 out of approximately 35,000 coming from the region where Chirac had held his seat as deputy), as well as a lack of financial transparency ( and the communal debt, were thwarted by the legal impossibility of questioning him as president.

The conditions of the privatisation of the Parisian water system acquired very cheaply by the and the , then directed by Jérôme Monod, a close friend of Chirac, were also criticised. Furthermore, the satirical newspaper revealed the astronomical &quot;food expenses&quot; paid by the Parisian municipality (€15 million a year according to the , expenses managed by Roger Romani (who allegedly destroyed all archives of the period 1978–93 during night raids in 1999–2000). Thousands of people were invited each year to receptions in the Paris city hall, while many political, media and artistic personalities were hosted in private flats owned by the city.

Chirac&#x27;s immunity from prosecution ended in May 2007, when he left office as president. In November 2007 a preliminary charge of misuse of public funds was filed against him. Chirac is said to be the first former French head of state to be formally placed under investigation for a crime. On 30 October 2009, a judge ordered Chirac to stand trial on embezzlement charges, dating back to his time as mayor of Paris.

On 7 March 2011, he went on trial on charges of diverting public funds, accused of giving fictional city jobs to 28 activists from his political party while serving as the mayor of Paris (1977–95). Along with Chirac, nine others stood trial in two separate cases, one dealing with fictional jobs for 21 people and the other with jobs for the remaining seven. The President of Union for a Popular Movement, who later served as France&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, was sentenced to a 14-month suspended prison sentence for the same case in 2004.

On 15 December 2011, Chirac was found guilty and given a suspended sentence of two years. He was convicted of diverting public funds, abuse of trust and illegal conflict of interest. The suspended sentence meant he did not have to go to prison and took into account his age, health and status as a former head of state. He did not attend the trial, since medical doctors deemed that his neurological problems damaged his memory. His defence team decided not to appeal.

=== The Clearstream Affair ===

During April and May 2006, Chirac&#x27;s administration was beset by a crisis as his chosen prime minister, Dominique de Villepin, was accused of asking Philippe Rondot, a top level French spy, for a secret investigation into Villepin&#x27;s chief political rival, Nicolas Sarkozy, in 2004. This matter has been called the second Clearstream Affair. On 10 May 2006, following a Cabinet meeting, Chirac made a rare television appearance to try to protect Villepin from the scandal and to debunk allegations that Chirac himself had set up a Japanese bank account containing 300 million francs in 1992 as Mayor of Paris. Chirac said that &quot;The Republic is not a dictatorship of rumours, a dictatorship of calumny.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 1956, Chirac married Bernadette Chodron de Courcel, with whom he had two daughters: (4 March 195814 April 2016) and Claude (born 6 December 1962). Claude was a long-term public relations assistant and personal adviser to her father, while Laurence, who suffered from anorexia nervosa in her youth, did not participate in her father&#x27;s political activities. Chirac was the grandfather of Martin Rey-Chirac by the relationship of Claude with French judoka Thierry Rey. A former Vietnamese refugee, Anh Dao Traxel, is a foster daughter of Jacques and Bernadette Chirac.

Chirac remained married, but had many other relationships.

Chirac was a close friend of actor Gregory Peck.

== Academic works ==
In 1954, Chirac presented &quot;The Development of the Port of New-Orleans&quot;, a short geography/economic thesis to the (), which he had entered three years before. The 182-page typewritten work, supervised by Professor Jean Chardonnet, is illustrated by photographs, sketches and diagrams.

<doc id="39766" wikidata="Q201350" url="?curid=39766" title="History of Sweden">
<text>The history of Sweden can be traced back to the melting of the Northern Polar Ice Caps. From as early as 12000 BC, humans have inhabited this area. Throughout the Stone Age, between 8000 BC and 6000 BC, early inhabitants used stone-crafting methods to make tools and weapons for hunting, gathering and fishing as means of survival. Written sources about Sweden before AD 1000 are rare and short, usually written by outsiders. It is usually accepted that Swedish recorded history, in contrast with pre-history, starts around the late 10th century, when sources are common enough that they can be contrasted with each other.

The modern Swedish state was formed over a long period of unification and consolidation. Historians have set different standards for when it can be considered complete. Some common laws were present from the second half of the 13th century. At this time, Sweden consisted of most of what is today the southern part of the country (except for Scania, Blekinge, Halland and Bohuslän), as well as parts of modern Finland. Over the following centuries, Swedish influence would expand into the North and East.

In the late 14th century Sweden, Denmark and Norway were united in the Kalmar Union. During the following century, a series of rebellions lessened Sweden&#x27;s ties to the union, sometimes even leading to the election of a separate Swedish king. The fighting reached a climax following the Stockholm Bloodbath in 1520, a mass execution of accused heretics orchestrated by Christian II of Denmark. One of the few members of the most powerful noble families not present, Gustav Vasa, was able to raise a new rebellion and eventually was crowned King in 1523. His reign proved lasting and marked the end of Sweden&#x27;s participation in the Kalmar Union. Gustav Vasa furthermore encouraged Protestant preachers, finally breaking with the papacy and establishing the Lutheran Church in Sweden, seizing Catholic Church property and wealth.

During the 17th century, after winning wars against Denmark–Norway, Russia, and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Sweden emerged as a great power by taking direct control of the Baltic region. Sweden&#x27;s role in the Thirty Years&#x27; War determined the political and religious balance of power in Europe. The Swedish Empire expanded enormously into the modern Estonia and Latvia, northern Germany, and several regions that to this day are part of Sweden.

Before the end of the 17th century, a secret alliance was formed between Denmark–Norway, Poland–Lithuania, and Russia against Sweden. This coalition acted at the start of the 18th century when Denmark–Norway and Poland launched surprise attacks on Sweden. In 1721, Russia and its allies won the war against Sweden. As a result, Russia was able to annex the Swedish territories of Estonia, Livonia, Ingria, and Karelia. This effectively put an end to the Swedish Empire, and crippled her Baltic Sea power. Sweden joined in the Enlightenment culture of the day in the arts, architecture, science, and learning. Between 1570 and 1800, Sweden experienced two periods of urban expansion. Finland was lost to Russia in a war in 1808–1809.

In the early 19th century, Finland and the remaining territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were lost. Sweden&#x27;s last war was the Swedish–Norwegian War (1814). Sweden was victorious in this war, leading to the Danish king being forced to cede Norway to Sweden. Norway was then forced to enter into a personal union with Sweden that lasted until 1905. Since 1814, Sweden has been at peace, adopting a non-aligned foreign policy in peacetime and neutrality in wartime. During World War I, Sweden remained neutral, but let the Germans travel in the country. Post-war prosperity provided the foundations for the social welfare policies characteristic of modern Sweden. During World War II, Sweden once again remained neutral, avoiding the fate of occupied Norway.

The country attempted to stay out of alliances and remain officially neutral during the entire Cold War, and declined to join NATO. The social democratic party held government for 44 years (1932–1976). The 1976 parliamentary elections brought a liberal/right-wing coalition to power. During the Cold War, Sweden remained neutral. The neutrality policy was dropped in 2022, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Sweden formally became a member of NATO in March 2024.

== Prehistoric Sweden before AD 800 ==

Sweden has a large number of petroglyphs (&quot;hällristningar&quot; in Swedish), with the highest concentration in the province of Bohuslän and the northern part of the county of Kalmar, also called &quot;Tjust&quot;. The earliest images can be found in the province of Jämtland, dating from 5000 BC. They depict wild animals such as elk, reindeer, bears and seals. 2300–500 BC was the most intensive carving period, with carvings of agriculture, warfare, ships, domesticated animals, etc. Petroglyphs with themes have also been found in Bohuslän, dating from 800 to 500 BC.

== Viking Period and Middle Ages: 800–1500 ==

For centuries, the Swedes were merchant seamen well known for their far-reaching trade. During the 11th and 12th centuries, Sweden gradually became a unified Christian kingdom that later included Finland. Until 1060, the kings of Uppsala ruled most of modern Sweden except for the southern and western coastal regions, which remained under Danish rule until the 17th century. After a century of civil wars, a new royal family emerged, which strengthened the power of the crown at the expense of the nobility, while giving the nobles privileges such as exemption from taxation in exchange for military service. Sweden never had a fully developed feudal system, and its peasants were never reduced to serfdom. The Vikings from Sweden partly took part in the raids of the Western and Southern regions of Europe, but mainly traveled east to Russia, Constantinople and the Muslim world (Serkland). The large Russian mainland and its many navigable rivers offered good prospects for merchandise and plundering. During the 9th century, extensive Scandinavian settlements began on the east side of the Baltic Sea.

The conversion from Norse paganism to Christianity was a complex, gradual, and at times violent (see Temple at Uppsala) process. The main early source of religious influence was England, due to interactions between Scandinavians and Saxons in the Danelaw, and with Irish missionary monks. German influence was less obvious in the beginning, despite an early missionary attempt by Ansgar, but gradually emerged as the dominant religious force in the area, especially after the Norman conquest of England. Despite the close relations between Swedish and Russian aristocracy (see also Rus&#x27;), there is no direct evidence of Orthodox influence.

Around the year 1000, Olof Skötkonung became the first known king to rule both Svealand and Götaland. Historical details about early medieval kings are obscure, and even the dates of their reigning periods remain unclear. In the 12th century, Sweden was still undergoing dynastic struggles between the Erik and Sverker clans. Svealand and the Swedes were usually more supportive of the Erik dynasty and Götaland and Geats more supportive of the Sverker dynasty, which wanted friendlier relations with Denmark. This further divided the country between parties because the ruler was not clear. The country elected their king from each district by selecting 12 people from the local nobles, who then elected the king at the Stones of Mora. The divide ended when a third clan married into the Erik clan and founded the Bjälbo dynasty. This dynasty gradually consolidated Sweden to a strong state.

During the early Middle Ages, the Swedish kingdom also expanded to control Norrland and Finland. This expansion sparked tension with the Russian states, a tension that was to continue throughout Swedish history.

In 1319, Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus Eriksson, who was the paternal grandson of King Magnus Ladulås of Sweden and the maternal grandson of King Haakon V of Norway. On 21 July 1336, Magnus was crowned king of Sweden and Norway in Stockholm. 

In 1332 the king of Denmark, Christopher II, died as a &quot;king without a country&quot; after he and his older brother and predecessor had divided Denmark into smaller polities. King Magnus took advantage of his neighbours&#x27; weakness, purchasing the lands of the eastern Danish provinces for 6500 kg of silver, which included Scania. 

After the Black Death and internal power struggles in Sweden, Queen Margaret I of Denmark (the former daughter-in-law of King Magnus Eriksson) united the Nordic countries in the Union of Kalmar in 1397, with the approval of the Swedish nobility.

== Early Modern Sweden: 1523–1611 ==
In the 16th century, Gustav Vasa (1496-1560) fought for an independent Sweden, crushing an attempt to restore the Union of Kalmar and laying the foundation for modern Sweden. At the same time, he broke with the papacy and established the Lutheran Church in Sweden.

The Union&#x27;s final disintegration in the early 16th century brought on a long-lived rivalry between Norway and Denmark on one side and Sweden on the other. The Catholic bishops had supported the Danish King Christian II, but he was overthrown by Gustavus Vasa, and Sweden became independent again. Gustavus used the Protestant Reformation to curb the power of the church and was crowned as King Gustavus I in 1523. In 1527, he persuaded the Riksdag of Västerås (comprising the nobles, clergy, burghers, and freehold peasants) to confiscate church lands, which comprised 21% of the farmland. Gustavus took the Lutheran reformers under his protection and appointed his men as bishops. Gustavus suppressed aristocratic opposition to his ecclesiastical policies and efforts at centralization.

Tax reforms took place in 1538 and 1558, whereby multiple complex taxes on independent farmers were simplified and standardized throughout the district; tax assessments per farm were adjusted to reflect an ability to pay. Crown tax revenues increased, but more importantly, the new system was perceived as fairer and more acceptable. A war with Luebeck in 1535 resulted in the expulsion of the Hanseatic traders, who previously had had a monopoly of foreign trade. With its own businessmen in charge, Sweden&#x27;s economic strength grew rapidly, and by 1544 Gustavus controlled 60% of the farmlands in all of Sweden. Sweden now built the first modern army in Europe, supported by a sophisticated tax system and government bureaucracy. Gustavus proclaimed the Swedish crown hereditary and the house of Vasa ruled Sweden (1523–1654) and Poland (1587–1668).


==Rise as a Great Power==
During the 16th and 17th centuries, the kings demanded ever increasing taxes and military conscription, emphasizing the need for defense. However the money and manpower were used for offensive warfare. Indeed, when there seemed to be a real threat of invasion in 1655–1660, King Charles X Gustav asked the people to give more and to manage their own defences. Finally a balance was reached that provided a well supplied aggressive foreign policy. During the 17th century, after winning wars against Denmark, Russia, and Poland, Sweden (with scarcely more than 1 million inhabitants) emerged as a great power by taking direct control of the Baltic region, which was Europe&#x27;s main source of grain, iron, copper, timber, tar, hemp, and furs.

Sweden had first gained a foothold on territory outside its traditional provinces in 1561, when Estonia opted for vassalage to Sweden during the Livonian War. While, in 1590, Sweden had to cede Ingria and Kexholm to Russia, and Sigismund tried to incorporate Swedish Estonia into the Duchy of Livonia, Sweden gradually expanded at the eastern Baltic during the following years. In a series of Polish–Swedish War (1600–1629) and the Russo-Swedish Ingrian War, Gustavus Adolphus retook Ingria and Kexholm (formally ceded in the Treaty of Stolbovo, 1617) as well as the bulk of Livonia (formally ceded in the Treaty of Altmark, 1629).

Sweden&#x27;s role in the Thirty Years&#x27; War determined the political as well as the religious balance of power in Europe. From bridgeheads in Stralsund (1628) and Pomerania (1630), the Swedish army advanced to the south of the Holy Roman Empire, and in a side theater of the war deprived Denmark–Norway of Danish Estonia, Jämtland, Gotland, Halland, Härjedalen, Idre and Särna, became exempt from the Sound Dues, and established claims to Bremen-Verden, all of which was formalized in the Treaty of Brömsebro (1645). In 1648, Sweden became a guarantor power for the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War and left her with the additional dominions of Bremen-Verden, Wismar and Swedish Pomerania. From 1638 Sweden also held the colony of New Sweden, along the Delaware River in North America.

===Sweden as a Great Power 1648–1721===
In 1655, in the Second Northern War, Charles X Gustav of Sweden invaded and occupied western Poland–Lithuania, the eastern half of which was already occupied by Russia. The rapid Swedish advance became known in Poland as the Swedish Deluge. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania became a Swedish fief, the Polish–Lithuanian regular armies surrendered and the Polish King John II Casimir Vasa fled to the Habsburgs. The Deluge lasted for five years and took a great toll on Poland and Lithuania, with some historians crediting this invasion as the start of the downfall of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The country was devastated, treasures stolen, and insurmountable loss of lives occurred.

Sweden was able to establish control of the Eastern bank of the Sound, formalised in the Treaty of Roskilde (1658), and gain recognition of her southeastern dominions by the European great powers in the Treaty of Oliva (1660); but Sweden was barred from further expansion at the Southern coast of the Baltic. Sweden came out of the Scanian War with only minor losses largely due to France forcing Sweden&#x27;s adversaries into the treaties of Fontainebleau (1679) (confirmed at Lund) and Saint-Germain (1679).

The following period of peace allowed Charles XI of Sweden to reform and stabilise the realm. He consolidated the finances of the Crown by the great reduction of 1680; further changes were made in finance, commerce, national maritime and land armaments, judicial procedure, church government and education.

=== The Great Northern War: 1700 ===

Russia, Saxony–Poland, and Denmark–Norway pooled their power in 1700 and attacked the Swedish Empire. Although the young Swedish King Charles XII (1682–1718; reigned 1697–1718) won spectacular victories in the early years of the Great Northern War, most notably in the stunning success against the Russians at the Battle of Narva (1700), his plan to attack Moscow and force Russia into peace proved too ambitious.

The Russians won decisively at the Battle of Poltava in June 1709, capturing much of the exhausted Swedish army. Charles XII and the remnants of his army were cut off from Sweden and fled south into Ottoman territory, where he remained three years. He overstayed his welcome, refusing to leave until the Ottoman Empire joined him in a new war against Tsar Peter I of Russia. He established a powerful political network in Constantinople, which included even the mother of the sultan. Charles&#x27;s persistence worked, as Peter&#x27;s army was checked by Ottoman troops. However, Turkish failure to pursue the victory enraged Charles and from that moment his relations with the Ottoman administration soured. During the same period, the behavior of his troops worsened and turned disastrous. Lack of discipline and contempt for the locals soon created an unbearable situation in Moldavia. The Swedish soldiers behaved badly, destroying, stealing, raping, and killing. Meanwhile, back in the north, Sweden was invaded by its enemies; Charles returned home in 1714, too late to restore his lost empire and impoverished homeland; he died in 1718. In the subsequent peace treaties, the allied powers, joined by Russia and Great Britain-Hanover, ended Sweden&#x27;s reign as a great power. Russia now dominated the north. The war-weary Riksdag asserted new powers and reduced the crown to a constitutional monarchy, with power held by a civilian government controlled by the Riksdag. A new &quot;Age of Freedom&quot; opened, and the economy was rebuilt, supported by large exports of iron and lumber to Britain. The Riksdag developed into an active parliament. This tradition continued into the nineteenth century, laying the basis for the transition towards a modern democracy.

The reign of Charles XII (1697–1718) has stirred up great controversy. Historians have puzzled over why this military genius overreached and greatly weakened Sweden. Although most early-19th-century historians tended to follow Voltaire&#x27;s lead in bestowing extravagant praise on the warrior-king, others have criticised him as a fanatic, a bully, and a bloodthirsty warmonger. A more balanced view suggests a highly capable military ruler whose oft-reviled peculiarities seemed to have served him well, but who neglected his base in Sweden in pursuit of foreign adventure. Slow to learn the limits of Sweden&#x27;s diminished strength, a party of nobles, who called themselves the &quot;Hats&quot;, dreamed of revenge on Russia and ruled the country from 1739 to 1765; they engaged in wars in 1741, 1757, Russian influence grew in Sweden after the war in 1741 which greatly affected politics in the Swedish realm (though much of this influence was lost in 1790 as a result of the Russo-Swedish war of 1788–1790).

===Enlightenment===
Sweden joined in the Enlightenment culture of the day in the arts, architecture, science, and learning. A new law in 1766 established for the first time the principle of freedom of the press, a notable step towards liberty of political opinion. The Academy of Science was founded in 1739 and the Academy of Letters, History, and Antiquities in 1753. The outstanding cultural leader was Carl Linnaeus (1707–78), whose work in biology and ethnography had a major impact on European science.

Following half a century of parliamentary domination came the reaction from the monarchy. King Gustav III (1746–1792) came to the throne in 1771, and in 1772 led a coup d&#x27;état, with French support, that established him as an &quot;enlightened despot&quot;, who ruled at will. The Age of Freedom and party politics was over. Precocious and well-educated, he became a patron of the arts and music. His edicts reformed the bureaucracy, repaired the currency, expanded trade, and improved defense. The population had reached two million and the country was prosperous, although rampant alcoholism was a growing social problem. Gustav III weakened the nobility and promoted numerous major social reforms. He felt the Swedish monarchy could survive and flourish by achieving a coalition with the newly emerged middle classes against the nobility. He personally disliked the French Revolution but decided to promote additional anti-feudal reforms to strengthen his hand among the middle classes.

After Gustav made war on Russia and did poorly, he was assassinated by a conspiracy of nobles who were angry that he tried to restrict their privileges for the benefit of the peasants. Under the successor, King Gustav IV, Sweden joined various coalitions against Napoleon but was badly defeated and lost much of its territory, especially Finland and Pomerania. The king was overthrown by the army, which in 1810 decided to bring in one of Napoleon&#x27;s marshals, Jean Bernadotte, as the heir apparent.

====Colonies and slavery====
Sweden experimented briefly with overseas colonies, including &quot;New Sweden&quot; in Colonial America and the &quot;Swedish Gold Coast&quot; in present-day Ghana, which began in the 1630s. Sweden purchased the small Caribbean island of Saint Barthélemy from France in 1784, then sold it back in 1878; the population had included slaves until they were freed by the Swedish government in 1847.

====Early urbanisation====
Between 1570 and 1800, Sweden experienced two periods of urban expansion, c. 1580–1690 and in the mid-18th century, separated by relative stagnation from the 1690s to about 1720. The initial phase was the more active, including an increase in the percentage of urban dwellers in Stockholm – a pattern comparable to increasing urban populations in other European capital and port cities – as well as the foundation of a number of small new towns. The second period of urban growth began around 1750 in response to shifts in Swedish trade patterns from the Baltic to the North Atlantic. It was characterised by increasing populations in the small towns of the north and west.

==19th century==
=== Gustavian era ===
=== Loss of Finland: 1809 ===
Finland was lost to Russia in a war that lasted from February 1808 to September 1809. As a result of the peace agreement, Finland became a Grand Duchy and thus was officially ruled by the Tsar of Russia though it was not strictly part of Russia. Humanitarian aid from England did not succeed in preventing Sweden from adopting more Napoleon-friendly policies after the Swedish coup d&#x27;état in 1809.

=== Union with Norway: 1814 ===

In 1810, French Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, one of Napoleon&#x27;s top generals, was elected as Charles XIV John of Sweden (1818–44) by the Riksdag. He had a Jacobin background and was well-grounded in revolutionary principles, but put Sweden in the coalition that opposed Napoleon. In 1813, his forces joined the allies against Napoleon and defeated the Danes at Bornhöved. In the Treaty of Kiel, Denmark ceded mainland Norway to the Swedish king. Norway, however, declared its independence, adopted a constitution and chose a new king. Sweden invaded Norway to enforce the terms of the Kiel treaty in the last war Sweden has fought. After brief fighting, the peace established a personal union between the two states. Even though they shared the same king, Norway was largely independent of Sweden, except Sweden controlled foreign affairs. The king&#x27;s rule was not well received and when Sweden refused to allow Norway to have its own diplomats, Norway rejected the King of Sweden in 1905 and selected its own king.

During Charles XIV&#x27;s reign, the first stage of the Industrial Revolution reached Sweden. This first take-off was founded on rural forges, textile proto-industries and sawmills.

The popularity of Charles XIV decreased for a time in the 1830s, culminating in the Rabulist riots in 1838 after the Lèse-majesté conviction of the journalist Magnus Jacob Crusenstolpe, and some calls for his abdication.

The 19th century was marked by the emergence of a liberal opposition press, the abolition of guild monopolies in trade and manufacturing in favor of free enterprise, the introduction of taxation and voting reforms, the installation of a national military service, and the rise in the electorate of three major party groups: the Social Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, and the Conservative Party.

=== Modernization of Sweden: 1860–1910 ===

Sweden, much like Japan at the same time, transformed from a stagnant rural society to a vibrant industrial society between the 1860s and 1910. The agricultural economy shifted gradually from a communal village to a more efficient private farm-based agriculture. There was less need for manual labor on the farm so many went to the cities and a million Swedes emigrated to the United States between 1850 and 1890. Many returned and brought word of the higher productivity of American industry, this stimulating faster modernization.

In 1873, Sweden and Denmark formed the Scandinavian Monetary Union.

The late 19th century saw the emergence of an opposition press, the abolition of guild monopolies on craftsmen and the reform of taxation. Two years of military service was made compulsory for young men although there was no warfare.

=== Health ===
The steady decline of death rates in Sweden began about 1810. For men and women of working age, the death rate trend diverged, however, leading to increased excess male mortality during the first half of the century. There were very high rates of infant and child mortality before 1800. Among infants and children between the ages of one and four, smallpox peaked as a cause of death in the 1770–1780s and declined afterward. Mortality also peaked during this period due to other air-, food-, and waterborne diseases, but these declined as well during the early 19th century. The decline of several diseases during this time created a more favorable environment that increased children&#x27;s resistance to disease and dramatically lowered child mortality.

The introduction of compulsory gymnastics in Swedish schools in 1880 rested partly on a long tradition, from Renaissance humanism to the Enlightenment, of the importance of physical as well as intellectual training. More immediately, the promotion of gymnastics as a scientifically sound form of physical discipline coincided with the introduction of conscription, which gave the state a strong interest in educating children physically as well as mentally for the role of citizen soldiers. Skiing is a major recreation in Sweden and its ideological, functional, ecological, and social impact has been great on Swedish nationalism and consciousness. Swedes perceived skiing as virtuous, masculine, heroic, in harmony with nature, and part of the country&#x27;s culture. A growing awareness of strong national sentiments and an appreciation of natural resources led to the creation of the Swedish Ski Association in 1892 in order to combine nature, leisure, and nationalism. The organization focused its efforts on patriotic, militaristic, heroic, and environmental Swedish traditions as they relate to ski sports and outdoor life.

==20th century==
With a broader voting franchise, the nation saw the emergence of three major party groups – Social Democrat, Liberal, and Conservative. The parties debated further expansion of the voting franchise. The Liberal Party, based on the middle class, put forth in 1907 a program for local voting rights later accepted in the Riksdag. The majority of Liberals wanted to require some property ownership before a man could vote, while the Social Democrats called for total male suffrage without property limitations. The strong farmer representation in the Second Chamber of the Riksdag maintained a conservative view, but their decline after 1900 gradually ended opposition to full suffrage.

Religion maintained a major role but public school religious education changed from the drill in the Lutheran catechism to biblical-ethical studies.

===Sweden in World War I===
Sweden was neutral in World War I, although the Swedish government was sympathetic to both sides at different times during the conflict, even briefly occupying the Åland islands jointly with the Germans. At first, the Swedish government flirted with the possibility of changing their neutral stance to side with the Central Powers, and made concessions to them including mining the Öresund straits to close them to Allied warships wishing to enter the Baltic. Later the Swedish signed agreements allowing trade with the Allied powers and limiting trade with Central Powers, though this brought about the fall of the government of Hjalmar Hammarskjöld.

=== Industrialization: 1910–1939 ===
During the First World War and the 1920s, its industries expanded to meet the European demand for Swedish steel, ball bearings, wood pulp, and matches. Post-war prosperity provided the foundations for the social welfare policies characteristic of modern Sweden.

=== Welfare state ===

Sweden created a successful model of social democracy because of the unique way in which Sweden&#x27;s labor leaders, politicians, and classes cooperated during the early development of Swedish democracy. Sweden&#x27;s socialist leaders chose a moderate, reformist political course with broad-based public support. This helped Sweden avoid the severe extremist challenges and political and class divisions that plagued many European countries that attempted to develop social democratic systems after 1911. By dealing early, cooperatively, and effectively with the challenges of industrialization and its impact on Swedish social, political, and economic structures, Swedish social democrats were able to create one of the most successful social democratic systems in the world, including both a welfare state and extensive protections of civil liberties.

When the Social Democratic Party came into power in 1932, its leaders introduced a new political decision-making process, which later became known as &quot;the Swedish model&quot; or the &quot;Folkhemmet&quot; (&quot;The People&#x27;s Home&quot;). The party took a central role, but tried as far as possible to base its policy on mutual understanding and compromise. Different interest groups were always involved in official committees that preceded government decisions.

===Foreign policy 1920–1939===

Foreign policy concerns in the 1930s centered on Soviet and German expansionism, which pursuing abortive efforts at Nordic defense co-operation.

=== Sweden during World War II ===
Sweden followed a policy of armed neutrality during World War II, although thousands of Swedish volunteers fought in the Winter War with Finland against the Soviets. Sweden did permit German troops to pass through its territory to and from occupation duties in Norway, and supplied the Nazi regime with steel and ball-bearings.

The dominant historiography for decades after the war ignored the Holocaust and used what it called the &quot;small state realist&quot; argument. It held that that neutrality and co-operation with Germany were necessary for survival since Germany was vastly more powerful, concessions were limited and were only made when the threat was too great. Neutrality was bent but not broken; national unity was paramount; and in any case, Sweden had the neutral right to trade with Germany. Germany needed Swedish iron, and Sweden had nothing to gain and much to lose from an invasion. The nation was run by a national unity government, which included all major parties in the Riksdag except the communist party. Its key leaders included Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson, King Gustav V, and Foreign Minister Christian Günther.

Humanitarian aid to Jews facing the Holocaust was the mission of Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg. As the secretary of the 1944 Swedish delegation to Hungary, to co-ordinate humanitarian relief for the Jews of Europe during the Jewish Holocaust. He helped to rescue tens of thousands of Jews in Nazi-occupied Hungary in late 1944. He disappeared in January 1945, and probably died in a Soviet prison in 1947.

=== Post-war Sweden ===
Sweden was one of the first non-participants of World War II to join the United Nations (in 1946). Apart from this, the country&#x27;s leaders tried to stay out of alliances and remained officially neutral during the entire Cold War, not joining NATO until 2024.

The social democratic party held government for 44 years (1932–1976). They spent much of the 1950s and 1960s building &quot;Folkhemmet&quot; (&quot;The People&#x27;s Home&quot;), the Swedish welfare state. Sweden&#x27;s industry had not been damaged by the war and it was in a position to help re-build Northern Europe in the decades following 1945. This led to an economic upswing in the post-war era that made the welfare system feasible. However, by the 1970s, the economies of the rest of Western Europe were prosperous and growing rapidly, while the Swedish economy stagnated. Many economists blamed its large tax funded public sector.

In 1976, the social democrats lost their majority. The 1976 parliamentary elections brought a liberal/right-wing coalition to power. Over the next six years, four governments ruled and fell, composed by all or some of the parties that had won in 1976. The fourth liberal government in these years came under fire by Social Democrats and trade unions and the Moderate Party, culminating in the Social Democrats regaining power in 1982.

During the Cold War Sweden maintained a dual approach, publicly the strict neutrality policy was forcefully maintained, but unofficially strong ties were kept with the U.S., Norway, Denmark, West Germany, and other NATO countries. Swedes hoped that the U.S. would use conventional and nuclear weapons in case of a Soviet attack on Sweden. A strong ability to defend against an amphibious invasion was maintained, complete with Swedish-built warplanes, but there was no long-range bombing capability.

In the early 1960s, U.S. nuclear submarines armed with mid-range Polaris A-1 nuclear missiles were deployed not far from the Swedish west coast. Range and safety considerations made this a good area from which to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike on Moscow. The U.S. secretly provided Sweden with a military security guarantee, promising to provide military force in aid of Sweden in case of Soviet aggression. As part of the military cooperation, the U.S. provided much help in the development of the Saab 37 Viggen, as a strong Swedish air force was seen as necessary to keep Soviet anti-submarine aircraft from operating in the missile launch area. In return, Swedish scientists at the Royal Institute of Technology made considerable contributions to enhancing the targeting performance of the Polaris missiles.

On 28 February 1986, the Social Democratic leader Prime Minister Olof Palme was assassinated. The murderer was never found. Shocked Swedes worried whether the nation had lost its innocence.

On 28 September 1994, the MS Estonia sank as the ship was crossing the Baltic Sea, en route from Tallinn, Estonia, to Stockholm, Sweden. The disaster claimed the lives of 852 people (501 of them were Swedes), being one of the worst maritime disasters of the 20th century.

In 1995, a few years after the end of the Cold War, Sweden became a member of the European Union and the old term &quot;policy of neutrality&quot; fell out of use. In a referendum held in 2003, the majority voted not to adopt the Euro as the country&#x27;s official currency. Foreign Minister Anna Lindh was murdered just before the referendum.

During the 1980s, Sweden attempted to preserve its model of capitalism plus a generous welfare state through what it called a &quot;bridging policy.&quot; Unintended consequences became apparent in the 1990s. There was an economic crisis with high unemployment and several banks and companies going bankrupt. There was high inflation as well as overheated real estate and financial markets and a negative real rate of interest. After 1991, these factors caused a recession with high unemployment. There were political reverberations and businesses called for neoliberal government policies. By 2000, however, the positive trends dominated. Compared to the rest of Europe, unemployment in Sweden was low, while economic growth has been high, inflation low, the budget in balance, and the balance of payments positive.

==Foreign policy==
The foreign policy of Sweden encompasses a range of themes over the centuries. Some of the main issues include:

* Sweden has historically pursued a policy of neutrality, aiming to avoid involvement in conflicts between major powers. This neutrality allowed Sweden to navigate the tumultuous European political landscape and maintain its sovereignty. It dropped the neutrality policy in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and joined NATO in 2024. On 7 March 2024, Sweden became NATO’s 32nd member country.
* Sweden has sought to maintain a balance of power in Northern Europe, acting as a counterweight to dominant regional powers. This approach aimed to prevent any single power from gaining excessive influence and threatening Swedish interests.
* Sweden&#x27;s historical dominance in the Baltic Sea region played a crucial role in shaping its diplomatic history. Through territorial expansion, Sweden established control over strategic territories, such as present-day Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and parts of Russia, impacting its relations with neighboring states.
* During the 17th and 18th centuries, Sweden emerged as a major European power, participating in conflicts such as the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the Great Northern War. Its diplomatic efforts were often influenced by power struggles with other European great powers, such as Russia and Poland.
* Sweden has actively engaged in peace mediation efforts, seeking to resolve conflicts and broker peace agreements. Notable examples include the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War, and various mediation efforts during the 20th century.
* Sweden has a longstanding tradition of promoting international cooperation, human rights, and humanitarian initiatives. It has been involved in the establishment of international organizations such as the League of Nations and the United Nations, and has championed causes such as humanitarian aid and disarmament.
* Sweden has pursued close ties and cooperation with its neighboring Nordic countries, particularly Denmark, Finland, Iceland, and Norway. This commitment to Scandinavian unity has been reflected in diplomatic initiatives, trade agreements, and cultural exchanges.
* Sweden&#x27;s relationship with the European Union (EU) has been a significant theme in its recent diplomatic history. While Sweden joined the EU in 1995, it has maintained a somewhat reserved approach, often balancing its national interests with EU membership.
* Sweden has been an advocate for global development and has provided substantial aid to developing countries. It has sought to address global inequalities and promote sustainable development through its aid programs, often challenging neocolonial practices.
* In the 21st century, Sweden has gained attention for its feminist foreign policy approach, which aims to integrate gender equality into its diplomatic efforts. Sweden has been a leading advocate for women&#x27;s rights globally, emphasizing the inclusion and empowerment of women in peacebuilding, conflict resolution, and development processes.

==Historiography==
According to Lönnroth (1998) in the 19th century and early 20th century, Swedish historians saw their writing in terms of literature and storytelling, rather than analysis and interpretation. Harald Hjärne (1848–1922) pioneered modern historical scholarship. In 1876, he attacked the traditional myths of the social and legal conditions of ancient Greece and Rome inherited from the classical authors. He was inspired by German scholar Barthold Georg Niebuhr (1776–1831), a founder of modern German historiography. As a professor of history at Uppsala University, Hjärne became a spokesman for the Conservative Party and the Swedish monarchy by 1900. Hjärne had an enormous influence on his students and, indeed, on an entire generation of historians, who mostly became political conservatives and nationalists. Another movement emerged at Lund University around 1910, where critical scholars began using the source critics&#x27; methods to the early history of Scandinavia. The brothers Lauritz Weibull and Curt Weibull were the leaders, and they had followers at Lund and Göteborg universities. The result was a half-century of often embittered controversy between traditionalists and revisionists that lasted until 1960. There was a blurring of the ideological fronts resulting from experiences during and after World War II. In the meantime, in the general expansion of university education in the postwar period, history was generally neglected. Only through the activities of the National Research Council of the Humanities and the dedicated efforts of certain ambitious university professors created some expansion of historical scholarship. After 1990, there were signs of revival in historiography, with a strong new emphasis on 20th-century topics, as well as the application of social history and computerized statistical techniques to the demographic history of ordinary villagers before 1900.

According to Lars Magnusson, social history is a specialty inside economic history. Three major themes are the standard of living by strata during industrialization; the history of work; and social issues in preindustrial society and the transition to industrialism.

<text>The European Union is a geo-political entity, created in 1993, covering a large portion of the European continent. It is founded upon numerous treaties and has undergone expansions and secessions that have taken it from six member states to 27, a majority of the states in Europe.

Since the beginning of the institutionalised modern European integration in 1948, the development of the European Union has been based on a supranational foundation that would &quot;make war unthinkable and materially impossible&quot; and reinforce democracy amongst its members as laid out by Robert Schuman and other leaders in the Schuman Declaration (1950) and the Europe Declaration (1951). This principle was at the heart of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) (1951), the Treaty of Paris (1951), and later the Treaty of Rome (1957) which established the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC). The Maastricht Treaty (1992) created the European Union with its pillars system, including foreign and home affairs alongside the European Communities. This in turn led to the creation of the single European currency, the euro (launched 1999). The ECSC expired in 2002. The Maastricht Treaty has been amended by the treaties of Amsterdam (1997), Nice (2001) and Lisbon (2007), the latter merging the three pillars into a single legal entity, though the EAEC has maintained a distinct legal identity despite sharing members and institutions.

==Development of Europe as a region==

===Europe as a continent===
The known world in Ancient Greece was differentiated into three landmasses: Asia, &quot;Libya&quot; (Africa) and Europe, giving rise to identifying the European landmass as a coherent area, a continent.

===Roman Europes===
The European landmass was populated and territorialized by many long before its conceptualization as a coherent continent. But the Roman Empire, an empire built on the Hellenistic world and Alexandrian Empire, Ancient Egypt, the Levant and North Africa, became the first state to control the whole Mediterranean Basin and also large parts, particularly the Southern and Western parts of the European landmass. This historic prominence in the Mediterranean Basin and Europe has been invoked by states that came after it, claiming succession to Roman authority and to legitimate their rule over lands throughout the former Roman eucomene, and therefore also in Europe, particularly in Western Europe, the lands of the later Western Roman Empire of latin Rome. The latter established Western Europe as a coherent and independent political area of Europe, which has taken sometimes prominence, as simply the West, over the concept of Europe. Similarly other concepts for Europe as a coherent political space have been used, such as for example Frangistan.

The claims for the succession of the control over the West, after the fall of Western Rome in 476 developed into the concept of &quot;translatio imperii&quot; (&quot;transfer of rule&quot;) through the King of Italy, enabling claims by the Goths, Lombards, Frankish Empire (481/800–843) and Holy Roman Empire (800/962–1806).
Furthermore, during and after the Roman Empire the concept &quot;renovatio imperii&quot; (&quot;restoration of the empire&quot;) was employed, particularly in the forms of the religiously inspired &quot;Imperium Christianum&quot; (&quot;christian empire&quot;), and later the &quot;Reichsidee&quot; (&quot;imperial idea&quot;), to establish and sustain a coherent political region. As such the position and extent of influence of the Papacy over a range of European lands has been a force, while not exclusively European, capable of rallying European powers under a common Christian identity.
That said, some European powers, such as France (after the installment of the Holy Roman Empire with East Francia) and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth challenged the Western Roman authority through the Western Schism and the Italian Wars, while England, the Dutch Republic, Prussia, the Swedish Empire and Denmark–Norway also challenged the Papal one with Protestant Reformation.

The Greek Eastern Rome, also called Byzantine Empire, remained long after the dissolution of the Western Roman Empire, sustaining a coherent political space also over large areas of Europe, particularly of (South-) Eastern Europe, or simply the East, giving rise to the other major particular Europe. With the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire in 1453, the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Tsardom, and ultimately the Empire (1547–1917), with Moscow as the so-called Third Rome, used claims of inheritance of the eastern Roman Empire to legitimate their rule over larger areas of Europe, though not exclusively.

===Other Europes===
But also other polities of Europe have established, independently from Rome and Byzantine, their European realms, such as a range of pre-Roman or pre-Christian Greek, Germanic, Celtic, Slavic and Hungarian powers, Khanates, or Al-Andalus and the Sicilian Emirate.

==Ideas of European unity before 1948==

Apart from the ideas of federation, confederation, or customs union such as Winston Churchill&#x27;s 1946 call for a &quot;United States of Europe&quot;, the original development of the European Union was based on a supranational foundation that would &quot;make war unthinkable and materially impossible&quot; 
A peaceful means of some consolidation of European territories used to be provided by dynastic unions; less common were country-level unions, such as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Austro-Hungarian Empire.

In 15th century, King of Bohemia George of Poděbrady proposed the Treaty on the Establishment of Peace throughout Christendom which sought to end military conflict between Christian kingdoms of Europe. The treaty proposed a multilateral framework, including a peaceful dispute resolution process, but despite a vigorous promotional campaign, the proposal was ultimately unsuccessful. This effort has been occasionally noted as a first coherent proposal for a proto-European Union.

In the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle of 1818, Tsar Alexander, as the most advanced internationalist of the day, suggested a kind of permanent European union and even proposed the maintenance of international military forces to provide recognised states with support against changes by violence.

Pan-European political thought truly emerged during the 19th century, inspired by the liberal ideas of the French and American Revolutions. The following Napoleonic Wars and First French Empire (1804–1815), brought down the Holy Roman Empire, enabled nationalism and following the Congress of Vienna, the ideals of internationalism like with Immanuel Kant and European unity flourished across the continent, especially in the writings of Wojciech Jastrzębowski (1799–1882) or Giuseppe Mazzini (1805–1872). The term &quot;United States of Europe&quot; () was used at that time by Victor Hugo (1802–1885) during a speech at the International Peace Congress held in Paris in 1849:

===From World War I to World War II===
During the interwar period, the consciousness that national markets in Europe were interdependent though confrontational, along with the observation of a larger and growing US market on the other side of the ocean, nourished the urge for the economic integration of the continent. In 1920, advocating the creation of a European economic union, the British economist John Maynard Keynes wrote that &quot;a Free Trade Union should be established ... to impose no protectionist tariffs whatever against the produce of other members of the Union.&quot; During the same decade, the Austrian Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, in light of the dissolution of the Habsburg Empire, imagined as one of the first modern political unions of Europe, founded the Pan-Europa Movement. His ideas influenced his contemporaries, among whom was then-Prime Minister of France Aristide Briand. As French prime minister, Nobel Peace Prize laureate for the Locarno Treaties and follower of the Paneuropean Union Aristide Briand delivered a widely recognized speech at the League of Nations, the precursor of the United Nations, in Geneva on 5 September 1929 for a federal Europe to secure Europe and settle the historic Franco-German enmity.

=== World War II (1939–1945) ===
World War II from 1939 to 1945 demonstrated more than ever the horrors of war, but particularly also of extremism, of discrimination and of genocide. As with devastating wars before, there was a desire to ensure it could never happen again, particularly with the war bringing the world nuclear weapons. Most European countries failed to maintain their Great Power status, with the exception of the Soviet Union, which became a superpower after World War II and maintained that status for 45 years. This left two rival ideologically opposed superpowers.

With large scale war being waged in Europe once again in the 1930s and becoming World War II, the question of what to fight against and what for, had to be agreed on. A first agreement was the Declaration of St James&#x27;s Palace of 1941, when Europe&#x27;s resistance gathered in London. This was expanded on by the 1941 Atlantic Charter, establishing the Allies and their common goals, inciting a new wave of global international institutions like the United Nations (founded 1945) or the Bretton Woods System (1944).

During the 1943 Moscow Conference and Tehran Conference plans to establish joint institutions for a post-war world and Europe became increasingly an agenda. This led to a decision at the Yalta Conference in 1944 to form a European Advisory Commission, later replaced by the Council of Foreign Ministers and the Allied Control Council, following the German surrender and the Potsdam Agreement in 1945. 

With war still raging, resistance movements formulated their vision of a post-war Europe, the Ventotene prison Manifesto of 1941 by Altiero Spinelli propagated European integration through the Italian Resistance and after 1943 through the Italian European Federalist Movement. In March 1943, in a radio address, the United Kingdom&#x27;s leader Sir Winston Churchill spoke warmly of &quot;restoring the true greatness of Europe&quot; once victory had been achieved, and mused on the post-war creation of a &quot;Council of Europe&quot; which would bring the European nations together to build peace.

===Aftermath (1945–1948)===

By the end of the war European integration became seen as an antidote to the extreme nationalism which caused the war. On 19 September 1946 in a much recognized speech Winston Churchill reiterated his calls since 1930 for a &quot;European Union&quot; and &quot;Council of Europe&quot;, at the University of Zürich. After leaving office, Churchill called as a civilian for a United States of Europe. Coincidentally parallel to his speech the Hertenstein Congress in the Lucerne Canton was being held, resulting in the Union of European Federalists, one of the then founded and later constituting members of the European Movement. Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, who successfully established during the interwar period the oldest organization for European integration, the Paneuropean Union, founded in June 1947 the European Parliamentary Union (EPU). To ensure Germany could never threaten the peace again, its heavy industry was partly dismantled (See: Allied plans for German industry after World War II) and its main coal-producing regions were either awarded to neighbouring countries (Silesia), managed as separate directly by an occupying power (Saarland) or put under international control (Ruhr area).

Though by 1947 a growing rift between the western Allied Powers and the Soviet Union became evident as a result of the rigged 1947 Polish legislative election which constituted an open breach of the Yalta Agreement, followed by the announcement of the Truman Doctrine on 12 March 1947. On 4 March 1947 France and the United Kingdom signed the Treaty of Dunkirk for mutual assistance in the event of future military aggression in the aftermath of World War II against any of the pair. The rationale for the treaty was the threat of a potential future military attack, specifically a Soviet one in practice, though publicised under the disguise of a German one, according to the official statements. Immediately following the February 1948 coup d&#x27;état by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the London Six-Power Conference was held, resulting in the Soviet boycott of the Allied Control Council and its incapacitation, an event marking the beginning of the Cold War. The remainder of the year 1948 marked the beginning of the institutionalised modern European integration.

== Initial years (1948–1957) ==
With the start of the Cold War, the Treaty of Brussels was signed in 1948 establishing the Western Union (WU) as the first organisation, followed by the International Authority for the Ruhr. In the same year, the Organization for European Economic Co-operation, the predecessor of the OECD, was also founded to manage the Marshall Plan; the Eastern Bloc responded with establishing the Comecon.

A pivotal moment in European integration was the Hague Congress of May 1948, as it led to the creation of the European Movement International, the College of Europe and most importantly to the founding of the Council of Europe on the 5th of May 1949 (now known as Europe Day). The Council of Europe was the first institution to bring the sovereign nations of Western Europe together, raising great hopes and fevered debates in the following two years for further European integration. It has since been a broad forum to further cooperation and shared issues, achieving things like the 1950-signed European Convention on Human Rights.

Essential for the actual birth of the institutions of the EU was the 9th of May 1950 Schuman Declaration (on the day after the fifth Victory Day, today&#x27;s Europe day – of the EU). On the basis of that speech, France, Italy, the Benelux countries (Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg) together with West Germany signed the Treaty of Paris (1951) creating the European Coal and Steel Community the following year; this took over the role of the International Authority for the Ruhr and lifted some restrictions on German industrial productivity. It gave birth to the first institutions, such as the High Authority (now the European Commission) and the Common Assembly (now the European Parliament). The first presidents of those institutions were Jean Monnet and Paul-Henri Spaak respectively. The founding fathers of the European Union understood that coal and steel were the two industries essential for waging war, and believed that by tying their national industries together, a future war between their nations became much less likely. Backed by the Marshall Plan with large funds coming from the United States since 1948, the ECSC became a milestone organization, enabling European economic development and integration and being the origin of the main institutions of the EU such as the European Commission and Parliament.

The formation of the European Coal and Steel Community was advanced by American Secretary of State George C. Marshall. His namesake plan to rebuild Europe in the wake of World War II contributed more than $100 billion in today&#x27;s dollars to the Europeans, helping to feed Europeans, deliver steel to rebuild industries, provide coal to warm homes, and construct dams to help provide power. In doing so, the Marshall Plan encouraged the integration of European powers into the European Coal and Steel Community, the precursor to present-day European Union, by illustrating the effects of economic integration and the need for coordination. The potency of the Marshall Plan caused former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt to remark in 1997 that &quot;America should not forget that the development of the European Union is one of its greatest achievements. Without the Marshall Plan it perhaps would never have come to that.&quot;

Paralleling Schuman, the Pleven Plan of 1951 tried, but failed to tie the institutions of the developing European community under the European Political Community, which was to include the also proposed European Defence Community, an alternative to West Germany joining NATO which was established 1949 under the Truman Doctrine.
In 1954 the Western European Union was founded, after NATO took over competences from the WU, and West Germany joined. This prompted the Soviet Union to form the Warsaw Pact in 1955, allowing it to enforce its standing in Eastern Europe.

The attempt to turn the Saar protectorate into a &quot;European territory&quot; was rejected by a referendum in 1955. The Saar was to have been governed by a statute supervised by a European Commissioner reporting to the Council of Ministers of the Western European Union.

After the failed attempts at creating defence (European Defence Community) and political communities (European Political Community), leaders met at the Messina Conference and established the Spaak Committee which produced the Spaak report. The report was accepted at the Venice Conference (29 and 30 May 1956), which decided to organise an Intergovernmental Conference. The Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom focused on economic unity, leading to the Treaties of Rome being signed in 1957 – this established the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) among the members.

==1958–1972: Three communities==
The two new communities were created separately from ECSC, although they shared the same courts and the Common Assembly. The executives of the new communities were called Commissions, as opposed to the &quot;High Authority&quot;. The EEC was headed by Walter Hallstein (Hallstein Commission) and Euratom was headed by Louis Armand (Armand Commission) and then Étienne Hirsch. Euratom would integrate sectors in nuclear energy while the EEC would develop a customs union between members.

Throughout the 1960s tensions began to show with France seeking to limit supranational power and rejecting the membership of the United Kingdom. However, in 1965 an agreement was reached to merge the three communities under a single set of institutions, and hence the Merger Treaty was signed in Brussels and came into force on 1 July 1967 creating the European Communities. Jean Rey presided over the first merged Commission (Rey Commission).

While the political progress of the Communities was hesitant in the 1960s, this was a fertile period for European legal integration. Many of the foundational legal doctrines of the Court of Justice were first established in landmark decisions during the 1960s and 1970s, above all in the &quot;Van Gend en Loos&quot; decision of 1963 that declared the &quot;direct effect&quot; of European law, that is to say, its enforceability before national courts by private parties. Other landmark decisions during this period included &quot;Costa v ENEL&quot;, which established the supremacy of European law over national law and the &quot;Dairy Products&quot; decision, which declared that general international law principles of reciprocity and retaliation were prohibited within the European Community. All three of these judgments were made after the appointment of French judge Robert Lecourt in 1962, and Lecourt appears to have become a dominant influence on the Court of Justice over the 1960s and 1970s.

==1973–1993: Enlargement to Delors==
After much negotiation, and following a change in the French Presidency, Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom (with Gibraltar) eventually joined the European Communities on 1 January 1973. This was the first of several enlargements which became a major policy area of the Union (see: Enlargement of the European Union).

In 1979, the European Parliament held its first direct elections by universal suffrage. 410 members were elected, who then elected the first female President of the European Parliament, Simone Veil.

A further enlargement took place in 1981 with Greece joining on 1 January, six years after applying. In 1982, Greenland voted to leave the Community after gaining home rule from Denmark (See also: Special member state territories and the European Union). Spain and Portugal joined (having applied in 1977) on 1 January 1986 in the third enlargement.

Recently appointed Commission President Jacques Delors (Delors Commission) presided over the adoption of the European flag by the Communities in 1986. In the first major revision of the treaties since the Merger Treaty, leaders signed the Single European Act in February 1986. The text dealt with institutional reform, including extension of community powers – in particular in regarding foreign policy. It was a major component in completing the single market and came into force on 1 July 1987.
In 1987 Turkey formally applied to join the Community and began the longest application process for any country. After the 1988 Polish strikes and the Polish Round Table Agreement, the first small signs of opening in Central Europe appeared. The opening of a border gate between Austria and Hungary at the Pan-European Picnic on August 19, 1989 then set in motion a peaceful chain reaction, at the end of which there was no longer a GDR and the Eastern Bloc had disintegrated. Otto von Habsburg and Imre Pozsgay saw the event as an opportunity to test Mikhail Gorbachev`s reaction to an opening of the Iron Curtain. In particular, it was examined whether Moscow would give the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary the command to intervene. But with the mass exodus at the Pan-European Picnic, the subsequent hesitant behavior of the Socialist Unity Party of East Germany and the non-intervention of the Soviet Union broke the dams. So the bracket of the Eastern Bloc was broken and as a result the Berlin Wall fell together with the whole Iron Curtain. Germany reunified and the door to enlargement to the former Eastern Bloc was opened (See also: Copenhagen Criteria).

With a wave of new enlargements on the way, the Maastricht Treaty was signed on 7 February 1992 which established the European Union when it came into force the following year.

==1993–2004: Creation==
On 1 November 1993, under the third Delors Commission, the Maastricht Treaty became effective, creating the European Union with its pillar system, including foreign and home affairs alongside the European Community. The 1994 European elections were held resulting in the Party of European Socialists maintaining their position as the largest party in Parliament. The Council proposed Jacques Santer as Commission President but he was seen as a second choice candidate, undermining his position. Parliament narrowly approved Santer but his commission gained greater support, being approved by 416 votes to 103. Santer had to use his new powers under Maastricht to flex greater control over his choice of Commissioners. They took office on 23 January 1995.

On 30 March 1994, accession negotiations concluded with Austria, Sweden and Finland. Meanwhile, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein joined the European Economic Area (which entered into force on 1 January 1994), an organisation that allowed European Free Trade Association states to enter the Single European Market. The following year, the Schengen Agreement came into force between seven members, expanding to include nearly all others by the end of 1996. The 1990s also saw the further development of the euro. 1 January 1994 saw the second stage of the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union begin with the establishment of the European Monetary Institute and at the start of 1999 the euro as a currency was launched and the European Central Bank was established. On 1 January 2002, notes and coins were put into circulation, replacing the old currencies entirely.
During the 1990s, the conflicts in the Balkans gave impetus to developing the EU&#x27;s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). The EU failed to react during the beginning of the conflict, and UN peacekeepers from the Netherlands failed to prevent the Srebrenica massacre (July 1995) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the largest mass murder in Europe since the Second World War. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) finally had to intervene in the war, forcing the combatants to the negotiation table. The early foreign policy experience of the EU led to foreign policy being emphasised in the Treaty of Amsterdam (which created the High Representative).

However, any success was overshadowed by the budget crisis in March 1999. The Parliament refused to approve the Commission&#x27;s 1996 community&#x27;s budget on grounds of financial mismanagement, fraud and nepotism. With Parliament ready to throw them out, the entire Santer Commission resigned. The post-Delors mood of euroscepticism became entrenched with the Council and Parliament constantly challenging the Commission&#x27;s position in coming years.

In the following elections, the Socialists lost their decades-old majority to the new People&#x27;s Party and the incoming Prodi Commission was quick to establish the new European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). Under the new powers of the Amsterdam Treaty, Prodi was described by some as the &#x27;First Prime Minister of Europe&#x27;. On 4 June, Javier Solana was appointed Secretary General of the Council and the strengthened High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy admitted the intervention in Kosovo – Solana was also seen by some as Europe&#x27;s first Foreign Minister. The Nice Treaty was signed on 26 February 2001 and entered into force on 1 February 2003 which made the final preparations before the 2004 enlargement to 10 new members.

==2004–2007: The great enlargement and consolidation==
On 10–13 June 2004, the 25 member states participated in the largest trans-national election in history (with the second largest democratic electorate in the world). The result of the sixth Parliamentary election was a second victory for the European People&#x27;s Party-European Democrats group. It also saw the lowest voter turnout of 45.5%, the second time it had fallen below 50%. On 22 July 2004, José Manuel Barroso was approved by the new Parliament as the next Commission President. However, his new team of 25 Commissioners faced a tougher road. With Parliament raising objections to a number of his candidates he was forced to withdraw his selection and try once more. The Prodi Commission had to extend their mandate to 22 November after the new line-up of commissioners was finally approved.

A proposed constitutional treaty was signed by plenipotentiaries from EU member states on 28 October 2004. The document was ratified in most member states, including two positive referendums. The referendums that were held in France and the Netherlands failed however, killing off the treaty. The European Council agreed that the constitution proposal would be abandoned, but most of its changes would be retained in an amending treaty. On 13 December 2007 the treaty was signed, containing opt-outs for the more eurosceptic members and no state-like elements. The Lisbon treaty finally came into force on 1 December 2009. It created the post of President of the European Council and significantly expanded the post of High Representative. After much debate about what kind of person should be President, the European Council agreed on a low-key personality and chose Herman Van Rompuy while foreign policy-novice Catherine Ashton became High Representative.

The 2009 elections again saw a victory for the European People&#x27;s Party, despite losing the British Conservatives who formed a smaller eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists grouping with other anti-federalist right wing parties. Parliament&#x27;s presidency was once again divided between the People&#x27;s Party and the Socialists, with Jerzy Buzek elected as the first President of the European Parliament from an ex-communist country. Barroso was nominated by the Council for a second term and received backing from EPP who had declared him as their candidate before the elections. However, the Socialists and Greens led the opposition against him despite not agreeing on an opposing candidate. Parliament finally approved Barroso II, though once more several months behind schedule.

In 2007, the fifth enlargement completed with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania on 1 January 2007. Also, in 2007 Slovenia adopted the euro, Malta and Cyprus in 2008 and Slovakia in 2009.

== 2008–2016: European crisis ==

However, trouble developed with existing members as the eurozone entered its first recession in 2008. Members cooperated and the ECB intervened to help restore economic growth and the euro was seen as a safe haven, particularly by those outside such as Iceland. With the risk of a default in Greece, Ireland, Portugal and other members in late 2009–10, eurozone leaders agreed to provisions for loans to member states who could not raise funds. Accusations that this was a U-turn on the EU treaties, which rule out any bail out of a euro member in order to encourage them to manage their finances better, were countered by the argument that these were loans, not grants, and that neither the EU nor other Member States assumed any liabilities for the debts of the aided countries. With Greece struggling to restore its finances, other member states also at risk and the repercussions this would have on the rest of the eurozone economy, a loan mechanism was agreed. The crisis also spurred consensus for further economic integration and a range of proposals such as a European Monetary Fund or federal treasury.

The European Union received the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize for having &quot;contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe.&quot; The Nobel Committee stated that &quot;that dreadful suffering in World War II demonstrated the need for a new Europe [...] today war between Germany and France is unthinkable. This shows how, through well-aimed efforts and by building up mutual confidence, historical enemies can become close partners.&quot; The Nobel Committee&#x27;s decision was subject to considerable criticism.

On 1 July 2013, Croatia joined the EU, and on 1 January 2014 the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte was added as an outermost region.

==2016–2020: Brexit==
On 23 June 2016, the citizens of the United Kingdom voted to withdraw from the European Union in a referendum and subsequently became the first and to date only member to trigger Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). The vote was in favour of leaving the EU by a margin of 51.9% in favour to 48.1% against. The UK&#x27;s withdrawal was completed on 31 January 2020.

==2020–2022: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic==
After the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic the EU leaders agreed for the first time to emit common debt to finance the European Recovery Program called Next Generation EU (NGEU).

==2022–present: Impact of the Russo-Ukrainian War==
On 24 February 2022, after massing near the borders of Ukraine, the Russian Armed Forces undertook a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The European Union imposed heavy sanctions on Russia and agreed on a pooled military aid package to Ukraine for lethal weapons funded via the European Peace Facility off-budget instrument. Likewise, neighbouring EU member countries received a mass influx of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the conflict over the course of the first weeks of the war. The conflict exposed the EU energy dependency on Russia, deemed as a supplier &quot;explicitly&quot; threatening the EU. This development injected a sense of urgency in the switch towards alternative energy suppliers and further development of clean energy sources.

==2024: The Draghi Report and the new European challenges==
Among the challenges of the European Union is the implementation of the European Green Deal. While among the new challenges there is the governance of AI that must combine the development of this new technology with the intrinsic risks that it brings to the European Union.
==2025: Donald Trump&#x27;s US Presidency==

The European Union must address the new US policy, implemented by Donald Trump&#x27;s second presidency of the United States in the economic, trade, financial and defense of the European continent. A challenge that places Europe in front of new choices of collaboration and opportunity that requires an unprecedented effort to maintain competitiveness as illustrated in Mario Draghi&#x27;s report.

== Reform ==
Multi-speed Europe is a concept of differentiated integration currently in operation that has recently been given renewed emphasis by a team of independent experts in a report presented at a council meeting in Brussels in September of 2023. &quot;France and Germany are pushing for a larger EU reform before any new member joins the bloc.&quot;

<text>Erich Ernst Paul Honecker (; 25 August 1912 – 29 May 1994) was a German communist politician who led the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) from 1971 until shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989. He held the posts of General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and Chairman of the National Defence Council; in 1976, he replaced Willi Stoph as Chairman of the State Council, the official head of state. As the leader of East Germany, Honecker was viewed as a dictator. During his leadership, the country had close ties to the Soviet Union, which maintained a large army in the country.

Honecker&#x27;s political career began in the 1930s when he became an official of the Communist Party of Germany, a position for which he was imprisoned by the Nazis. Following World War II, he was freed by the Soviet army and relaunched his political activities, founding the SED&#x27;s youth organisation, the Free German Youth, in 1946 and serving as the group&#x27;s chairman until 1955. As the Security Secretary of the SED Central Committee, he was the prime organiser of the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and, in this function, bore administrative responsibility for the &quot;order to fire&quot; along the Wall and the larger inner German border.

In 1970, Honecker initiated a political power struggle that led, with support of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, to him replacing Walter Ulbricht as General Secretary of the SED and chairman of the National Defence Council. Under his command, the country adopted a programme of &quot;consumer socialism&quot; and moved towards the international community by normalising relations with West Germany and also becoming a full member of the UN, in what is considered one of his greatest political successes. As Cold War tensions eased in the late 1980s with the advent of perestroika and glasnost—the liberal reforms introduced by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev—Honecker refused all but cosmetic changes to the East German political system. He cited the consistent hardliner attitudes of Kim Il Sung, Fidel Castro and Nicolae Ceaușescu whose respective governments of North Korea, Cuba and Romania had been critical of reforms. Honecker was forced to resign by the SED Politburo in October 1989 in a bid to improve the government&#x27;s image in the eyes of the public; the effort was unsuccessful, and the regime would collapse entirely the following month.

Following German reunification in 1990, Honecker sought asylum in the Chilean embassy in Moscow, but was extradited back to Germany in 1992, after the fall of the Soviet Union, to stand trial for his role in the human rights abuses committed by the East German government. However, the proceedings were abandoned, as Honecker was suffering from terminal liver cancer. He was freed from custody to join his family in exile in Chile, where he died in May 1994.

==Childhood and youth==
Honecker was born into a deeply Protestant family in Neunkirchen, in what is now Saarland, to Wilhelm Honecker (1881–1969), a coal miner and political activist, and his wife Caroline Catharine Weidenhof (1883–1963). The couple, married in 1905, had six children: Katharina (Käthe, 1906–1925), Wilhelm (Willi, 1907–1944), Frieda (1909–1974), Erich, Gertrud (1917–2010) and Karl-Robert (1923–1947). Erich, their fourth child, was born on 25 August 1912 during the period in which the family resided on Max-Braun-Straße, before later moving to Kuchenbergstraße 88 in the present-day Neunkirchen city district of Wiebelskirchen.

After World War I, the Territory of the Saar Basin was occupied by France. This change from the strict rule of Ferdinand Eduard von Stumm to French military occupation provided the backdrop for what Wilhelm Honecker understood as proletarian exploitation, and introduced young Erich to communism. After his tenth birthday in 1922, Erich Honecker became a member of the Spartacus League&#x27;s children&#x27;s group in Wiebelskirchen. Aged 14 he entered the KJVD, the Young Communist League of Germany, for whom he later served the organisation&#x27;s leader of Saarland from 1931.

Honecker did not find an apprenticeship immediately after leaving school, but instead worked for a farmer in Pomerania for almost two years. In 1928 he returned to Wiebelskirchen and began a traineeship as a roofer with his uncle, but quit to attend the International Lenin School in Moscow and Magnitogorsk after the KJVD handpicked him for a course of study there. There, sharing a room with Anton Ackermann, he studied under the cover name &quot;Fritz Malter&quot;.

==Opposition to the Nazis and imprisonment==
In 1930, aged 18, Honecker entered the KPD, the Communist Party of Germany. His political mentor was Otto Niebergall, who later represented the KPD in the Reichstag. After returning from Moscow in 1931 following his studies at the International Lenin School, he became the leader of the KJVD in the Saar region. After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Communist activities within Germany were only possible undercover; the Saar region however still remained outside the German Reich under a League of Nations mandate. Honecker was arrested in Essen, Germany, but soon released. Following this, he fled to the Netherlands and from there oversaw KJVD&#x27;s activities in Pfalz, Hesse and Baden-Württemberg.

Honecker returned to the Saar in 1934 and worked alongside Johannes Hoffmann on the campaign against the region&#x27;s re-incorporation into Germany. A referendum on the area&#x27;s future in January 1935 however saw 90.73% vote in favour of reunifying with Germany. Like 4,000 to 8,000 others, Honecker then fled the region, initially relocating to Paris.

On 28 August 1935 he illegally travelled to Berlin under the alias &quot;Marten Tjaden&quot;, with a printing press in his luggage. From there he worked closely together with KPD official Herbert Wehner in opposition/resistance to the Nazi state. On 4 December 1935 Honecker was detained by the Gestapo and until 1937 remanded in Berlin&#x27;s Moabit detention centre. On 3 July 1937 he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment for the &quot;preparation of high treason alongside the severe falsification of documents&quot;.

Honecker spent the majority of his incarceration in the Brandenburg-Görden Prison, where he also carried out tasks as a handyman. In early 1945, he was moved to the Barnimstrasse women&#x27;s prison in Berlin due to good behaviour and to be put to work repairing the bomb-damaged building, as he was a skilled roofer. During an Allied bombing raid on 6 March 1945, he managed to escape and hid himself at the apartment of Lotte Grund, a female prison guard. After several days she persuaded him to turn himself in, and his escape was then covered up by the guard.

After the liberation of the prisons by advancing Soviet troops on 27 April 1945, Honecker remained in Berlin. His &quot;escape&quot; from prison and his relationships during his captivity later led to his experiencing difficulties within the Socialist Unity Party, as well as straining his relations with his former inmates. In later interviews and in his personal memoirs, Honecker falsified many of the details of his life during this period. Material from the East German State Security Service has been used to allege that, to be released from prison, Honecker offered the Gestapo evidence incriminating fellow imprisoned Communists, claimed he had renounced communism &quot;for good&quot;, and was willing to serve in the German army.

==Post-war return to politics==

In May 1945 Honecker was &quot;picked up&quot; by chance in Berlin by Hans Mahle and taken to the Ulbricht Group, a collective of exiled German communists that had returned from the Soviet Union to Germany after the end of the Nazi regime. Through Waldemar Schmidt, Honecker befriended Walter Ulbricht, who had not been aware of him at that point. Honecker&#x27;s future role in the group was still undecided until well into the summer months, as he had yet to face a party process. This ended in a reprimand due to his &quot;undisciplined conduct&quot; in fleeing from prison at the start of the year, an action which was debated upon, potentially jeopardising the other (communist) inmates.

In 1946, Honecker became the co-founder of the Free German Youth (FDJ), whose chairmanship he also undertook. After the formation of the SED, the Socialist Unity Party, in April 1946 through a merger of the KPD and SPD, Honecker swiftly became a leading party member and took his place in the party&#x27;s Central Committee.
On 7 October 1949, the German Democratic Republic was formed with the adoption of a new constitution, establishing a political system similar to that of the Soviet Union. Within the state&#x27;s socialist single party government, Honecker determinedly resumed his political career and the following year was named as a candidate member of the Politbüro of the SED&#x27;s Central Committee. As President of the Free German Youth movement, he organised the inaugural &quot;Deutschlandtreffen der Jugend&quot; in East Berlin in May 1950 and the 3rd World Festival of Youth and Students in 1951, although the latter was beset with organisational problems.

During the internal party unrest following the suppressed uprising of June 1953, Honecker sided with First Secretary Walter Ulbricht, despite the majority of the Politburo attempting to depose Ulbricht in favour of Rudolf Herrnstadt. Honecker himself though faced questioning from party members about his inadequate qualifications for his position. On 27 May 1955 he handed the Presidency of the FDJ over to Karl Namokel, and departed for Moscow to study for two years at the School of the Soviet Communist Party at Ulbricht&#x27;s request. During this period he witnessed the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party in person, where its First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev denounced Joseph Stalin.

After returning to East Germany in 1958, Honecker became a fully-fledged member of the Politburo, taking over responsibility for military and security issues. As the Party Security Secretary he was the prime organiser of the building of the Berlin Wall in August 1961 and also a proponent of the &quot;order to fire&quot; along the Inner German border.

==Leadership of East Germany==

While Ulbricht had replaced the state&#x27;s command economy with, firstly the &quot;New Economic System&quot;, then the Economic System of Socialism, as he sought to improve the country&#x27;s failing economy, Honecker declared the main task under his New System of Economic Socialism to in fact be the &quot;unity of economic and social politics&quot;, essentially through which living standards (with increased consumer goods) would be raised in exchange for political loyalty. Tensions had already led to his once-mentor Ulbricht removing Honecker from the position of Second Secretary in July 1970, only for the Soviet leadership to swiftly reinstate him. Honecker played up the thawing East-West German relationship as Ulbricht&#x27;s strategy, to win the support of the Soviet leadership under Leonid Brezhnev. With this secured, Honecker was appointed First Secretary (from 1976 titled general secretary) of the Central Committee on 3 May 1971 after the Soviet leadership forced Ulbricht to step aside &quot;for health reasons&quot;.

After also succeeding Ulbricht as Chairman of the National Defence Council in 1971, Honecker was eventually also elected Chairman of the State Council (a post equivalent to that of president) on 29 October 1976. With this, Honecker reached the height of power within East Germany. From there on, he, along with Economic Secretary Günter Mittag and Minister of State Security Erich Mielke, made all key government decisions. Until 1989 the &quot;little strategic clique&quot; composed of these three men was unchallenged as the top level of East Germany&#x27;s ruling class. Honecker&#x27;s closest colleague was Joachim Herrmann, the SED&#x27;s Agitation and Propaganda Secretary. Alongside him, Honecker held daily meetings concerning the party&#x27;s media representation in which the layout of the party&#x27;s own newspaper &quot;Neues Deutschland&quot;, as well as the sequencing of news items in the national news bulletin &quot;Aktuelle Kamera&quot;, were determined. 

Under Honecker&#x27;s leadership, East Germany adopted a program of &quot;consumer socialism&quot;, which resulted in a marked improvement in living standards already the highest among the Eastern bloc countries – though still far behind West Germany. More attention was placed on the availability of consumer goods, and the construction of new housing was accelerated, with Honecker promising to &quot;settle the housing problem as an issue of social relevance&quot;. His policies were initially marked by a liberalisation toward culture and art. While 1973 brought the World Festival of Youth and Students to East Berlin, soon dissident artists such as Wolf Biermann were expelled and the Ministry for State Security raised its efforts to suppress political resistance. Honecker remained committed to the expansion of the Inner German border and the &quot;order to fire&quot; policy along it. During his time in the office around 125 East German citizens were killed while trying to reach the West.

After the Federal Republic had secured an agreement with the Soviet Union on cooperation and a policy of non-violence, it became possible to reach a similar agreement with the GDR. The Basic Treaty between East and West Germany in 1972 sought to normalise contacts between the two governments.

East Germany also participated in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe held in Helsinki in 1975, which attempted to improve relations between the West and the Eastern Bloc, and became a full member of the United Nations. These acts of diplomacy were considered Honecker&#x27;s greatest successes in foreign politics.

Honecker received additional high-profile personal recognitions including honorary doctorates of business administration from East Berlin&#x27;s Humboldt University in 1976, Tokyo&#x27;s Nihon University in 1981 and the London School of Economics in 1984 and the Olympic Order from the IOC in 1985. In September 1987, he became the first East German head of state to visit West Germany, where he was received with full state honours by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in an act that seemed to confirm West Germany&#x27;s acceptance of East Germany&#x27;s existence. During this trip he also journeyed to his birthplace in Saarland, where he held an emotional speech in which he spoke of a day when Germans would no longer be separated by borders. This trip had been planned twice before, including September 1984, but was initially blocked by the Soviet leadership which mistrusted the special East-West German relationship, particularly efforts to expand East Germany&#x27;s limited independence in the realm of foreign policy.

==Illness, downfall and resignation==
In the late 1980s, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced &quot;glasnost&quot; and &quot;perestroika&quot;, reforms to liberalise the socialist planned economy. Frictions between him and Honecker had grown over these policies and numerous additional issues from 1985 onward. East Germany refused to implement similar reforms, with Honecker reportedly telling Gorbachev: &quot;We have done our perestroika; we have nothing to restructure&quot;. Gorbachev grew to dislike Honecker, and by 1988 was lumping him in with Bulgaria&#x27;s Todor Zhivkov, Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Gustáv Husák and Romania&#x27;s Nicolae Ceaușescu as a &quot;Gang of Four&quot;: a group of inflexible hardliners unwilling to make reforms.

According to White House experts Philip Zelikow and Condoleezza Rice, Gorbachev looked to Communist leaders in Eastern Europe to follow his example of perestroika and glasnost. They argue:
: Gorbachev himself had no particular sympathy for Erich Honecker, chairman of the East German Communist Party, and his hard-line comrades and the government. As early as 1985... [Gorbachev] had told East German party officials that kindergarten was over; no one would lead them by the hand. They were responsible for their own people. The relations between Gorbachev and Honecker went downhill from there.
Western analysts, according to Zelikow and Rice, believed in 1989 that Communism was still secure in East Germany:
:Bolstered by relatively greater affluence than his country&#x27;s Eastern European neighbours enjoyed in a fantastically elaborate system of internal controls, East Germany&#x27;s longtime leader Eric Honecker seemed secure in his position. His government had long dealt with dissent through a mixture of brutal repression, forced emigration, and the vent of allowing occasional, limited travel to the West for a substantial part of the population.

Honecker felt betrayed by Gorbachev in his German policy and ensured that official texts of the Soviet Union, especially those concerning &quot;perestroika&quot;, could no longer be published or sold in East Germany.
 One month after the 1989 Polish legislative election in which Lech Wałęsa and the Solidarity Citizens&#x27; Committee unexpectedly won 99 out of 100 seats, at the Warsaw Pact summit on 7–8 July 1989 in Bucharest, the Soviet Union reaffirmed its shift from the Brezhnev Doctrine of the limited sovereignty of its member states, and announced &quot;freedom of choice&quot;. The Bucharest statement prescribed that its signatories henceforth developed their &quot;own political line, strategy and tactics without external intervention&quot;. This called into question the Soviet guarantee of existence for the Communist states in Europe. Already in May 1989 Hungary had begun dismantling its border with Austria, creating the first gap in the so-called Iron Curtain, through which later several thousand East Germans quickly fled in hopes of reaching West Germany by way of Austria. But with the mass exodus at the Pan-European Picnic in August 1989 (which was based on an idea by Otto von Habsburg to test Gorbachev&#x27;s reaction to the opening of the border), the subsequent hesitant behaviour of the Socialist Unity Party of East Germany and the non-intervention of the Soviet Union opened the floodgates. Thus the united front of the Eastern Bloc was broken. The reaction to this from Erich Honecker in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; of 19 August 1989 was too late and showed the current loss of power: &quot;Habsburg distributed leaflets far into Poland, on which the East German holidaymakers were invited to a picnic. When they came to the picnic, they were given gifts, food and Deutsche Mark, and then they were persuaded to come to the West.&quot; Later, after his fall, Honecker said of Otto von Habsburg in connection with the summer of 1989: &quot;That this Habsburg drove the nail into my coffin.&quot; Now tens of thousands of media-informed East Germans made their way to Hungary, which was no longer ready to keep its borders completely closed or to oblige its border troops to use force of arms. A 1969 treaty required the Hungarian government to send the East Germans back home; however, starting on 11 September 1989, the Hungarians let them pass into Austria, telling their outraged East German counterparts that they were refugees and that international treaties on refugees took precedence.

At the time, Honecker was sidelined through illness, leaving his colleagues unable to act decisively. He had been taken ill with biliary colic during the Warsaw Pact summit. He was shortly afterwards flown home to East Berlin. After an initial stabilisation in his health, he underwent surgery on 18 August 1989 to remove his inflamed gallbladder and, due to a perforation, part of his colon. According to the urologist Peter Althaus, the surgeons left a suspected carcinogenic nodule in Honecker&#x27;s right kidney due to his weak condition, and also failed to inform the patient of the suspected cancer; other sources say the tumour was simply undetected. As a result of this operation, Honecker was away from his office until late September 1989.

Back in office, Honecker had to contend with the rising number and strength of demonstrations across East Germany that had first been sparked by reports in the West German media of fraudulent results in local elections on 7 May 1989, the same results he had labelled a &quot;convincing reflection&quot; of the populace&#x27;s faith in his leadership. He also had to deal with a new refugee problem. Several thousand East Germans tried to go to West Germany by way of Czechoslovakia, only to have that government bar them from passing. Several thousands of them headed straight for the West German embassy in Prague and demanded safe passage to West Germany. With some reluctance, Honecker allowed them to go – but forced them to go back through East Germany on sealed trains and stripped them of their East German citizenship. Several members of the SED &quot;Politbüro&quot; realised this was a serious blunder and made plans to get rid of him.

As unrest visibly grew, large numbers began fleeing the country through the West German embassies in Prague and Budapest, as well as over the borders of the &quot;socialist brother&quot; states. Each month saw tens of thousands more exit. On 3 October 1989 East Germany closed its borders to its eastern neighbours and prevented visa-free travel to Czechoslovakia; a day later these measures were also extended to travel to Bulgaria and Romania. East Germany was now not only behind the Iron Curtain to the West, but also cordoned off from most other Eastern bloc states.
On 6–7 October 1989 the national celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the East German state took place with Gorbachev in attendance. To the surprise of Honecker and the other SED leaders in attendance, several hundred members of the Free German Youth — reckoned as the future vanguard of the party and nation — began chanting, &quot;Gorby, help us! Gorby, save us!&quot;. In a private conversation between the two leaders Honecker praised the success of the country, but Gorbachev knew that, in reality, it faced bankruptcy; East Germany had already accepted billions of dollars in loans from West Germany during the decade as it sought to stabilise its economy. Attempting to make Honecker accept a need for reforms, Gorbachev warned Honecker that &quot;He who is too late is punished by life&quot;, yet Honecker maintained that &quot;we will solve our problems ourselves with socialist means&quot;. Protests outside the reception at the Palace of the Republic led to hundreds of arrests in which many were brutally beaten by soldiers and police.
As the reform movement spread throughout Central and Eastern Europe, mass demonstrations against the East German government erupted, most prominently in Leipzig—the first of several demonstrations which took place on Monday nights across the country. In response, an elite paratroop unit was dispatched to Leipzig—almost certainly on Honecker&#x27;s orders, since he was commander-in-chief of the Army. A bloodbath was averted only when local party officials themselves ordered the troops to pull back. In the following week, Honecker faced a torrent of criticism. This gave his &quot;Politburo&quot; comrades the impetus they needed to replace him.

After a crisis meeting of the Politburo on 10–11 October 1989, Honecker&#x27;s planned state visit to Denmark was cancelled and, despite his resistance, at the insistence of the regime&#x27;s number-two-man, Egon Krenz, a public statement was issued that called for &quot;suggestions for attractive socialism&quot;. Over the following days Krenz worked to secure himself the support of the military and the Stasi and arranged a meeting between Gorbachev and Politburo member Harry Tisch, who was in Moscow, to inform the Kremlin about the now-planned removal of Honecker; Gorbachev reportedly wished them good luck.
The sitting of the SED Central Committee planned for the end of November 1989 was pulled forward a week, with the most urgent item on the agenda now being the composition of the Politburo. Krenz and Mielke attempted by telephone on the night of 16 October to win other Politburo members over to remove Honecker. At the beginning of the session on 17 October, Honecker asked his routine question of &quot;Are there any suggestions for the agenda?&quot; Stoph replied, &quot;Please, general secretary, Erich, I propose that a new item be placed on the agenda. It is the release of Comrade Erich Honecker as general secretary and the election of Comrade Egon Krenz in his place.&quot; Honecker reportedly calmly responded: &quot;Well, then I open the debate&quot;.

All those present then spoke, in turn, but none in favour of Honecker. Günter Schabowski even extended the dismissal of Honecker to also include his posts in the State Council and as Chairman of the National Defence Council while childhood friend Günter Mittag moved away from Honecker. Mielke, hollering and pounding the conference room table with his fist pointed at Honecker and blamed him for almost all the country&#x27;s current ills and threatened to publish compromising information that he possessed, if Honecker refused to resign. A ZDF documentary on the matter claims this information was contained in a large red briefcase found in Mielke&#x27;s possession in 1990. After three hours the Politburo voted to remove Honecker. In accordance with longstanding practice, Honecker voted for his own removal. When the public announcement was made, it was branded as a voluntary decision on Honecker&#x27;s part, ostensibly &quot;due to health reasons&quot;. Krenz was unanimously elected as his successor as General Secretary.

==Start of prosecution and asylum attempts==

Three weeks after Honecker&#x27;s ousting the Berlin Wall fell, and the SED swiftly lost control of the country. On 1 December, the Volkskammer deleted the provisions in the East German constitution giving the SED a monopoly on power, thus formally ending Communist rule in East Germany two months after Honecker&#x27;s removal. In an effort to rehabilitate itself, the SED expelled Honecker and several other former officials two days later. He went on to join the newly founded Communist Party of Germany in 1990, remaining a member until his death.

During November the People&#x27;s Chamber had already set up a committee to investigate corruption and abuses of office, with Honecker being alleged to have received annual donations from the National Academy of Architecture of around 20,000 marks as an &quot;honorary member&quot;. On 5 December 1989 the chief public prosecutor in East Germany formally launched a judicial inquiry against him on charges of high treason, abuses of confidence and embezzlement to the serious disadvantage of socialist property (the charge of high treason was dropped in March 1990). As a result, Honecker was placed under house arrest for a month.

Following the lifting of his house arrest, Honecker and his wife Margot were forced to vacate their apartment in the Waldsiedlung housing area in Wandlitz, exclusively used by senior SED party members, after the People&#x27;s Chamber decided to put it to use as a sanatorium for the disabled. In any case, Honecker spent the majority of January 1990 in hospital after having the error of the tumour missed in 1989 corrected after the suspicion of cancer was confirmed. Upon leaving the hospital on 29 January he was re-arrested and held at the Berlin-Rummelsburg remand centre. However, on the evening of the following day, 30 January, Honecker was again released from custody: The district court had annulled the arrest warrant and, due to medical reports, certified him unfit for detention and interrogation.

Lacking a home, Honecker instructed his lawyer Wolfgang Vogel to ask the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg for help. Pastor Uwe Holmer, leader of the Hoffnungstal Institute in Lobetal, Bernau bei Berlin, offered the couple a home in his vicarage. This drew immediate condemnation and later demonstrations against the church for assisting the Honeckers, given they had both discriminated against Christians who did not conform with the SED leadership&#x27;s ideology. Aside from a stay at a holiday home in Lindow in March 1990 that lasted only one day before protests swiftly brought it to an end, the couple resided at the Holmer residence until 3 April 1990.

The couple then moved into a three-room living quarters within the Soviet military hospital in Beelitz. Here, doctors diagnosed a malignant liver tumour following another re-examination. Following German reunification, prosecutors in Berlin issued a further arrest warrant for Honecker in November 1990 on charges that he gave the order to fire on escapees at the Inner German border in 1961 and had repeatedly reiterated that command (most specifically in 1974). However, this warrant was not enforceable because Honecker lay under the protection of Soviet authorities in Beelitz. On 13 March 1991 the Honeckers fled Germany from the Soviet-controlled Sperenberg Airfield to Moscow on a military jet with the aid of Soviet hardliners.

The German Chancellery had only been informed by Soviet diplomats about the Honeckers’ flight to Moscow one hour in advance. It limited its response to a public protest, claiming the existence of an arrest warrant meant the Soviet Union was breaching international law by admitting Honecker. The initial Soviet reaction was that Honecker was now too ill to travel and was receiving medical treatment after a deterioration of his health. He underwent further surgery the following month.

On 11 December 1991 the Honeckers sought refuge in the Chilean Embassy in Moscow, while also applying for political asylum in the Soviet Union. Despite an offer of help from North Korea, Honecker instead reached out to the Chilean government under Christian Democrat Patricio Aylwin. Under Honecker&#x27;s rule, East Germany had granted many Chileans exile following the military coup of 1973 by Augusto Pinochet. In addition his daughter Sonja was married to a Chilean. Chilean authorities, however, stated he could not enter their country without a valid German passport.

Mikhail Gorbachev agreed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 25 December 1991 and gave all his powers to Russian president Boris Yeltsin. Russian authorities had long been keen on expelling Honecker, against the wishes of Gorbachev, and the new government now demanded that he leave the country or else face deportation.

In June 1992, Chilean President Patricio Aylwin, leader of a center-left coalition, finally assured German Chancellor Helmut Kohl that Honecker would be leaving the embassy in Moscow. Reportedly against his will, Honecker was ejected from the embassy on 29 July 1992 and flown to Berlin&#x27;s Tegel Airport, where he was arrested and detained in Moabit Prison. By contrast, his wife Margot travelled on a direct flight from Moscow to Santiago, Chile, where she initially stayed with her daughter Sonja. Honecker&#x27;s lawyers unsuccessfully appealed for him to be released from detention in the period leading up to his trial.

==Criminal trial==

On 12 May 1992, while under protection in the Chilean embassy in Moscow, Honecker, along with several co-defendants, including Erich Mielke, Willi Stoph, Heinz Kessler, Fritz Streletz and Hans Albrecht, were accused in a 783-page indictment of taking part in the &quot;collective manslaughter&quot; of 68 people as they attempted to flee East Germany. It was alleged that Honecker, in his role as Chairman of the National Defence Council, had both given the decisive order in 1961 for the construction of the Berlin Wall and also, at subsequent meetings, ordered the extensive expansion of the border fortifications around West Berlin and the barriers to the West so as to make any passing impossible. In addition, specifically at a May 1974 sitting of the National Defence Council, he had stated that the development of the border must continue, that lines of fire were warranted along the whole border and, as prior, the use of firearms was essential: &quot;Comrades who have successfully used their firearms [are] to be praised&quot;.

The charges were approved by the Berlin District Court on 19 October 1992 at the opening of the trial. On the same day, it was decided that the hearing of 56 charges would be postponed and the remaining twelve cases would be the subject of the trial to begin on 12 November 1992. The question of under which laws the former East German leader could be tried was highly controversial and, in the view of many jurists, the process had an uncertain outcome.

During his 70-minute-long statement to the court on 3 December 1992, Honecker said that he had political responsibility for the building of the Berlin Wall and subsequent deaths at the borders, but claimed he was &quot;without juridical, legal or moral guilt&quot;. He blamed the escalation of the Cold War for the building of the Berlin Wall, saying the decision had not been taken solely by the East German leadership but all the Warsaw Pact countries that had collectively concluded in 1961 that a &quot;Third World War with millions dead&quot; would be unavoidable without this action. He quoted several West German politicians who had opined that the wall had indeed reduced and stabilised the two factions. He stated that he had always regretted every death, both from a human point of view and due to the political damage they caused.
Making reference to past trials in Germany against communists and socialists such as Karl Marx and August Bebel, he claimed that the legal process against him was politically motivated and a &quot;show trial&quot; against communism. He stated that no court lying in the territory of West Germany had the legal right to place him, his co-defendants or any East German citizen on trial, and that the portrayal of East Germany as an was contradictory to its recognition by over one hundred other states and the UN Security Council. Furthermore, he questioned how a German court could now legally judge his political decisions in the light of the lack of legal action taken over various military operations that had been carried out by Western countries with either overt support or absence of condemnation from (West) Germany. He dismissed public criticism of the Stasi, arguing that journalists in Western countries were praised for denouncing others. While accepting political responsibility for the deaths at the Wall, he believed he was free of any &quot;legal or moral guilt&quot;, and thought that East Germany would go down in history as &quot;a sign that socialism is possible and is better than capitalism&quot;.

By the time of the proceedings Honecker was already seriously ill. A new CT scan in August 1992 had confirmed an ultrasound examination made in Moscow and the existence of a malignant tumour in the right lobe of his liver. Based on these findings and additional medical testimonies, Honecker&#x27;s lawyers requested that the legal proceedings, as far as they were aimed against their client, be abandoned and the arrest warrant against him withdrawn; the cases against both Mielke and Stoph had already been postponed due to their ill health. Arguing that his life expectancy was estimated to be three to six months, while the legal process was forecast to take at least two years, his lawyers questioned whether it was humane to try a dying man. Their application was rejected on 21 December 1992 when the court concluded that, given the seriousness of the charges, no obstacle to the proceedings existed.

Honecker lodged a constitutional complaint to the recently created Constitutional Court of the State of Berlin, stating that the decision to proceed violated his fundamental right to human dignity, which was an overriding principle in the Constitution of Berlin, above even the state penal system and criminal justice. On 12 January 1993, Honecker&#x27;s complaint was upheld and the Berlin District Court therefore abandoned the case and withdrew their arrest warrant. An application for a new arrest warrant was rejected on 13 January. The court also refused to commence with the trial related to the indictment of 12 November 1992, and withdrew the second arrest warrant related to these charges. After a total of 169 days Honecker was released from custody, drawing protests both from victims of the East German regime as well as German political figures.

Honecker flew via Brazil to Santiago, Chile, to reunite with his wife and his daughter Sonja, who lived there with her son Roberto. Upon his arrival he was greeted by the leaders of the Chilean Communist and Socialist parties. In contrast, his co-defendants Heinz Kessler, Fritz Streletz and Hans Albrecht were sentenced on 16 September 1993 to imprisonment of between four and seven-and-a-half years. On 13 April 1993 a final attempt to separate and continue the trial against Honecker in his absence was discontinued. Four days later, on the 66th birthday of his wife Margot, he gave a final public speech, ending with the words: &quot;Socialism is the opposite of what we have now in Germany. For that I would like to say that our beautiful memories of the German Democratic Republic are testimony of a new and just society. And we want to always remain loyal to these things&quot;.

== Death ==
Honecker died on 29 May 1994 of liver cancer at the age of 81 in a terraced house in the La Reina district of Santiago. His funeral, arranged by the Communist Party of Chile, was conducted the following day at the central cemetery in Santiago.

==Family==

Honecker was married three times. After being liberated from prison in 1945, he married the prison warden Charlotte Schanuel (née Drost), nine years his senior, on 23 December 1946. She died suddenly from a brain tumour in June 1947. Details of this marriage were not revealed until 2003, well after his death.

By the time of her death, Honecker was already romantically involved with the Free German Youth official Edith Baumann, whom he met on a trip to Moscow. With her, he had a daughter, Erika (b. 1950), who later gave him his granddaughter Anke. Sources differ on whether Honecker and Baumann married in 1947 or 1949, but in 1952 he fathered an illegitimate daughter, Sonja (b. December 1952-2022), with Margot Feist, a People&#x27;s Chamber member and chairperson of the Ernst Thälmann Pioneer Organisation.

In September 1950, Baumann wrote directly to Walter Ulbricht to inform him of her husband&#x27;s extramarital activity in the hope of him pressuring Honecker to end his relationship with Feist. Following his divorce and reportedly under pressure from the Politburo, he married Feist. However, sources again differ on both the year of his divorce from Baumann and of his marriage to Feist; depending on the source, the events took place either in 1953 or 1955. For more than twenty years, Margot Honecker served as Minister of National Education. In 2012 intelligence reports collated by West German spies alleged that both Honecker and his wife had secret affairs but did not divorce for political reasons; however, his bodyguard Bernd Brückner, in a book about his time spent in Honecker&#x27;s service, denied the claims.

Honecker had three grandchildren from his daughter Sonja, who had married the Chilean-born exile Leonardo Yáñez Betancourt: Roberto (b. 1974), Mariana (b. 1985), who died in 1988 at the age of two leaving Honecker himself heartbroken, and Vivian (b. 1988). Roberto&#x27;s origins are debated; he is claimed to be the illegally adopted son of Heidi Stein, Dirk Schiller, born on 13 June 1975 in Görlitz, who disappeared in March 1979, due to alleged physical similarities between Dirk and Yáñez, Stein suspecting that her son might have been kidnapped at three years old by Stasi agents for Honecker&#x27;s younger daughter.

Honecker&#x27;s daughter divorced Yáñez in 1993. She resided in Santiago with her two surviving children and died in 2022.

==In popular culture==
Dmitri Vrubel&#x27;s 1990 mural on the Berlin Wall &quot;My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love&quot;, depicting a socialist fraternal kiss between Honecker and Leonid Brezhnev, became known around the world.


A traffic signal inspired by Honecker wearing a jaunty straw hat was used in parts of East Germany (Ost-Ampelmännchen) and has become a symbol of Ostalgie.
British actor Paul Freeman will portray Honecker in upcoming film &quot;Whispers of Freedom&quot;.

<text>The IBM AS/400 (Application System/400) is a family of midrange computers from IBM announced in June 1988 and released in August 1988. It was the successor to the System/36 and System/38 platforms, and ran the OS/400 operating system. Lower-cost but more powerful than its predecessors, the AS/400 was extremely successful at launch, with an estimated 111,000 installed by the end of 1990 and annual revenue reaching $14 billion that year, increasing to 250,000 systems by 1994, and about 500,000 shipped by 1997.

A key concept in the AS/400 platform is Technology Independent Machine Interface (TIMI), a platform-independent instruction set architecture (ISA) that is translated to native machine language instructions. The platform has used this capability to change the underlying processor architecture without breaking application compatibility. Early systems were based on a 48-bit CISC instruction set architecture known as the &quot;Internal Microprogrammed Interface&quot; (IMPI), originally developed for the System/38. In 1991, the company introduced a new version of the system running on a series of 64-bit PowerPC-derived CPUs, the IBM RS64 family. Due to the use of TIMI, applications for the original CISC-based programs continued to run on the new systems without modification, as the TIMI code can be re-translated to the new systems&#x27; PowerPC Power ISA native machine code. The RS64 was replaced with POWER4 processors in 2001, which was followed by POWER5 and POWER6 in later upgrades.

The AS/400 went through multiple re-branding exercises, finally becoming the System i in 2006. In 2008, IBM consolidated the separate System i and System p product lines (which had mostly identical hardware by that point) into a single product line named IBM Power Systems. The name &quot;AS/400&quot; is sometimes used informally to refer to the IBM i operating system running on modern Power Systems hardware.

== History ==

=== Fort Knox ===

In the early 1980s, IBM management became concerned that IBM&#x27;s large number of incompatible midrange computer systems was hurting the company&#x27;s competitiveness, particularly against Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s VAX. In 1982, a project named &quot;Fort Knox&quot; commenced, which was intended to consolidate the System/36, the System/38, the IBM 8100, the Series/1 and the IBM 4300 series into a single product line based around an IBM 801-based processor codenamed &quot;Iliad&quot;, while retaining backwards compatibility with all the systems it was intended to replace. A new operating system would be created for Fort Knox, but the operating systems of each platform which Fort Knox was intended to replace would also be ported to the Iliad processor to allow customers to migrate their software to the new platform.

The Fort Knox project proved to be overly ambitious and ran into multiple delays and changes of scope. As the project advanced, the requirement to support IBM 8100 and Series/1 software was dropped. When IBM&#x27;s engineers attempted to port the operating systems and software of their existing platforms, they discovered that it would be impossible without making extensive changes to the Iliad processor for each individual operating system — changes that Iliad&#x27;s architects were unwilling to make. The proposed solution to this was to augment Iliad with operating system-specific co-processors that provided hardware support for a single operating system. However, the amount of logic needed in each co-processor grew until the co-processors became the main processor, and the Iliad was relegated to the role of a support processor — thus failing the goal of consolidating on a single processor architecture. The Fort Knox project was ultimately cancelled in 1985.


=== Silverlake ===
During the Fort Knox project, a skunkworks project was started at IBM Rochester by engineers who believed that Fort Knox&#x27;s failure was inevitable. These engineers developed code that allowed System/36 applications to run on top of the System/38, and when Fort Knox was cancelled, this skunkworks project evolved into an official project to replace both the System/36 and System/38 with a single new hardware platform. The project became known as &quot;Silverlake&quot; (named for Silver Lake in Rochester, Minnesota) and officially began in December 1985. The Silverlake hardware was essentially an evolution of the System/38 that reused some of the technology developed for the Fort Knox project.

Silverlake&#x27;s goal was to deliver a replacement for the System/36 and System/38 in as short a timeframe as possible, as the Fort Knox project had stalled new product development at Rochester, leaving IBM without a competitive midrange system. On its launch in 1986, the System/370-compatible IBM 9370 was positioned as IBM&#x27;s preferred midrange platform, but failed to achieve the commercial success IBM hoped it would have. Much like Silverlake, the 9370 also reused the co-processor developed during the Fort Knox project as its main processor and the same SPD I/O bus that was derived from the Series/1 bus.

=== AS/400 ===
On June 21, 1988, IBM officially announced the Silverlake system as the &quot;Application System/400&quot; (AS/400). The announcement included more than 1,000 software packages written for it by IBM and IBM Business Partners. The AS/400 operating system was named &quot;Operating System/400&quot; (OS/400).

The creators of the AS/400 originally planned to use the name &quot;System/40&quot;, but IBM had adopted a new product nomenclature around the same time, which led to the Application System/400 name. First, IBM began prefixing &quot;System&quot; in product names with words to indicate the intended use or target market of the system (e.g., Personal System/2 and Enterprise System/9000). Second, IBM decided to reserve one- and two-digit model numbers for personal systems (e.g., PS/2 and PS/55), three-digit numbers for midrange systems (e.g., AS/400) and four-digit numbers for mainframes (e.g., ES/9000). The reassignment of two-digit model numbers from midrange systems to personal systems was to prevent the personal systems from running out of single-digit numbers for new products.

=== The move to PowerPC ===
In 1990, IBM Rochester began work to replace the AS/400&#x27;s original System/38-derived 48-bit CISC processors with a 96-bit architecture known as &quot;C-RISC&quot; (Commercial RISC). Rather than being a clean-slate design, C-RISC would have added RISC-style and VLIW-style instructions to the AS/400&#x27;s processor, while maintaining backwards compatibility with the System/370-style &quot;Internal Microprogrammed Interface&quot; (IMPI) instruction set and the microcode used to implement it.

In 1991, at the request of IBM president Jack Kuehler, a team under the leadership of Frank Soltis delivered a proposal to adapt the 64-bit PowerPC architecture to support the needs of the AS/400 platform. Their extensions to the PowerPC architecture, known as &quot;Amazon&quot; (and later as &quot;PowerPC AS&quot;), were approved by IBM management instead of the C-RISC design for development into the next AS/400 processor architecture. These extensions include support for tagged memory, as well as assistance for decimal arithmetic.

IBM initially attempted to create a single PowerPC implementation for both AS/400 and high-end RS/6000 systems known as &quot;Belatrix&quot;. The Belatrix project proved to be too ambitious, and was cancelled when it became apparent that it would not deliver on schedule. Instead, a pair of AS/400-specific processors were designed at IBM Endicott and IBM Rochester, known as &quot;Cobra&quot; (for low end systems) and &quot;Muskie&quot; (for high end systems) respectively. These became the initial implementations of the IBM RS64 processor line. The RS64 series continued to be developed as a separate product line at IBM until the POWER4 merged both the RS64 and POWER product lines together.

Despite the move from IMPI to an entirely different processor architecture, the AS/400&#x27;s Technology Independent Machine Interface (TIMI) mostly hid the changes from users and applications, and transparently recompiled applications for the new processor architecture. The port of OS/400 to the PowerPC AS architecture required a rewrite of most of the code below the TIMI due to the use of IMPI microcode to implement significant quantities of the operating system&#x27;s low level code. This led to the creation of the System Licensed Internal Code (SLIC) - a new implementation of the lower levels of the operating system mostly written in C++.

=== Rebranding ===
The AS/400 family line was rebranded several times in the 1990s and 2000s as IBM introduced newer generations of hardware and operating system. 

In 1994, the &quot;AS/400 Advanced Series&quot; name was used for new models, followed by the rebranding of the product line to &quot;AS/400e&quot; (the &quot;e&quot; standing for e-business) in 1997.

In 2000, the &quot;eServer iSeries&quot; was introduced as part of its &quot;eServer branding initiative&quot;. The eServer iSeries was built on the POWER4 processor from the RS64 processors used by previous generations, meaning that the same processors were used in both the iSeries and pSeries platforms, the latter of which ran AIX.

In 2004, &quot;eServer i5&quot; (along with OS/400 becoming &quot;i5/OS&quot;) the &quot;5&quot; signifying the use of POWER5 processors, was introduced, replacing the eServer iSeries brand. Successive generations of iSeries and pSeries hardware converged until they were essentially the same hardware sold under different names and with different operating systems. Some i5 servers were still using the AS/400-specific IBM Machine Type (MT/M 9406-520) and were able to run AIX in an LPar along i5/OS, while the p5 servers were able to run i5/OS, respectively. The licensing for AIX and i5/OS was controlled in the firmware by the POWER hypervisor.

The final rebranding occurred in 2006, when IBM rebranded the eServer i5 to &quot;System i&quot;.

In April 2008, IBM introduced the IBM Power Systems line, which was a convergence of System i and System p product lines. The first Power Systems machines used the POWER6 processors; i5/OS was renamed as &quot;IBM i&quot; in order to remove the association with POWER5 processors. IBM i is sold as one of the operating system options for Power Systems (along with AIX and Linux) instead of being tied to its own hardware platform.

=== Legacy ===
Although announced in 1988, the AS/400 remains IBM&#x27;s most recent major architectural shift that was developed wholly internally. After the departure of CEO John Akers in 1993, when IBM looked likely to be split up, Bill Gates commented that the only part of IBM that Microsoft would be interested in was the AS/400 division. (At the time, many of Microsoft&#x27;s business and financial systems ran on the AS/400 platform, rumored as ending around 1999 with the introduction of Windows 2000.)

== System architecture ==
According to Frank Soltis, one of the architects of the AS/400 platform, the AS/400&#x27;s architecture is defined by five architectural principles. Most of these principles are inherited from System/38.

=== Technology Independence ===
The high-level instruction set (called TIMI for &quot;Technology Independent Machine Interface&quot; by IBM) allows application programs to take advantage of advances in hardware and software without recompilation. TIMI is a virtual instruction set independent of the underlying machine instruction set of the CPU. User-mode programs contain both TIMI instructions and the machine instructions of the CPU, thus ensuring hardware independence. This is conceptually somewhat similar to the virtual machine architecture of programming environments such as Java and .NET.

Unlike some other virtual-machine architectures in which the virtual instructions are interpreted at run time, TIMI instructions are never interpreted. They constitute an intermediate compile time step and are translated into the processor&#x27;s instruction set as the final compilation step. The TIMI instructions are stored within the final program object, in addition to the executable machine instructions. This is how application objects compiled on one processor family (e.g., the original CISC AS/400 48-bit processors) could be moved to a new processor (e.g., PowerPC 64-bit) without re-compilation. An application saved from the older 48-bit platform can simply be restored onto the new 64-bit platform where the operating system discards the old machine instructions and re-translates the TIMI instructions into 64-bit instructions for the new processor.

The system&#x27;s instruction set defines all pointers as 128-bit. This was the original design feature of the System/38 (S/38) in the mid-1970s planning for future use of faster processors, memory, and an expanded address space. The original AS/400 CISC models used the same 48-bit address space as the S/38. The address space was expanded in 1995 when the RISC PowerPC RS64 64-bit CPU processor replaced the 48-bit CISC processor.

=== Software integration ===
OS/400 (now known as IBM i) is the native operating system of the AS/400 platform and was the sole operating system supported on the original AS/400 hardware. Many of the advanced features associated with the AS/400 are implemented in the operating system as opposed to the underlying hardware, which changed significantly throughout the life of the AS/400 platform. Features include a RDBMS (Db2 for i), a menu-driven interface, support for multiple users, block-oriented terminal support (IBM 5250), and printers.

=== Object-based design ===
Unlike the &quot;everything is a file&quot; principle of Unix and its derivatives, on IBM i everything is an object (with built-in persistence and garbage collection).

=== Single-level store ===
IBM uses a single-level store virtual memory architecture in the AS/400 platform. For 64-bit PowerPC processors, the virtual address resides in the rightmost 64 bits of a pointer while it was 48 bits in the S/38 and CISC AS/400. The 64-bit address space references main memory and disk as a single address set, which is the single-level store concept.

=== Hardware integration ===
Later generations of hardware are also capable of supporting various guest operating systems, including SSP, AIX, Linux, Microsoft Windows 2000, and Windows Server 2003. While OS/400, AIX, and Linux are supported on the POWER processors on LPARs (logical partitions), Windows is supported with either single-processor internal blade servers (IXS) or externally linked multiple-processor servers (IXA and iSCSI). SSP guests were supported using emulation from OS/400 V3R6 through V4R4 using the Advanced 36 Machine facility of the operating system, a feature distinct from the System/36 Environment compatibility layer, which requires System/36 software to be recompiled.

<doc id="39770" wikidata="Q1928207" url="?curid=39770" title="IBM System p">
<text>The IBM System p is a high-end line of RISC (Power)/UNIX-based servers. It was the successor of the RS/6000 line, and predecessor of the IBM Power Systems server series.

==History==
The previous RS/6000 line was originally a line of workstations and servers. The first System p server line was named the &quot;e&quot;Server pSeries in 2000 as part of the e-Server branding initiative.

In 2004, with the advent of the POWER5 processor, the server family was rebranded the &quot;e&quot;Server p5.

In 2005, following IBM&#x27;s move to streamline its server and storage brands worldwide, and incorporating the &quot;System&quot; brand with the Systems Agenda, the family was again renamed to System p5. The System p5 now encompassed the IBM OpenPower product line.

In 2007, after the introduction of the POWER6 processor models, the last rename under the System p brand dropped the p (numbered) designation.

In April 2008, IBM announced a rebranding of the System p and its unification with the mid-range System i platform. The resulting product line was called IBM Power Systems.

==Hardware and software==
===Processors===

Whereas the previous RS/6000 line used a mix of early POWER and PowerPC processors, when pSeries came along, this had evolved into RS64-III and POWER3 across the board—POWER3 for its excellent floating-point performance and RS64 for its scalability, throughput, and integer performance.

IBM developed the POWER4 processor to replace both POWER3 and the RS64 line in 2001. After that, the differences between throughput and number crunching-optimized systems no longer existed. Since then, System p machines evolved to use the POWER5 but also the PowerPC 970 for the low-end and blade systems.

The last System p systems used the POWER6 processor, such as the POWER6-based System p 570 and the JS22 blade. In addition, during the SuperComputing 2007 (SC07) conference in Reno, IBM introduced a new POWER6-based System p 575 with 32 POWER6 cores at 4.7 GHz and up to 256 GB of RAM with water cooling.

===Features===
All IBM System p5 and IBM &quot;e&quot;Server p5 machines support DLPAR (Dynamic Logical Partitioning) with Virtual I/O and Micro-partitioning.
System p generally uses the AIX operating system and, more recently, 64-bit versions of the Linux operating system.

<doc id="39772" wikidata="Q2936092" url="?curid=39772" title="Cape Cod Canal">
<text>The Cape Cod Canal is an artificial waterway in Massachusetts connecting Cape Cod Bay in the north to Buzzards Bay in the south, and is part of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. The approximately canal traverses the neck of land joining Cape Cod to the state&#x27;s mainland. It mostly follows tidal rivers widened to and deepened to at mean low water, shaving up to off the journey around the cape for its approximately 14,000 annual users.

Most of the canal is located in the town of Bourne, but its northeastern terminus is in Sandwich. Scusset Beach State Reservation lies near the canal&#x27;s north entrance, and the Massachusetts Maritime Academy is near its south. A swift-running current changes direction every six hours and can reach during the receding ebb tide.

The waterway is maintained by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and has no toll fees. It is spanned by the Cape Cod Canal Railroad Bridge, the Bourne Bridge, and the Sagamore Bridge. Traffic lights at either end govern the approach of vessels over .

The canal is occasionally used by whales and dolphins, including endangered North Atlantic right whales, which can cause closure of the canal.

==History==

Construction of a canal was first considered by Myles Standish of the Plymouth Colony in 1623, and the Pilgrims scouted the low-lying stretch of land between the Manomet and Scusset rivers for potential routes. William Bradford established the Aptucxet Trading Post in 1627 at the portage between the rivers. Trade prospered with the Indians of Narragansett Bay and the Dutch of New Netherland, and this was a major factor enabling the Pilgrims to pay off their debt.

In 1697, the General Court of Massachusetts considered the first formal proposal to build the canal but took no action. In 1717, a canal was created in Orleans, Massachusetts called Jeremiah&#x27;s Gutter which spanned a narrower portion of the Cape some distance to the east, but it remained active only until the late 1800s. More energetic planning with surveys took place repeatedly in 1776 (commissioned by George Washington), 1791, 1803, 1818, 1824–1830, and 1860. None of these efforts came to fruition.

The first attempts at actually building a canal did not take place until the late 19th century; earlier planners either ran out of money or were overwhelmed by the project&#x27;s size. The engineers finally decided which route to take through the hillsides by connecting and widening the Manomet and Scusset rivers. The first excavation began in 1880, when the Cape Cod Ship Canal Company hired 400 immigrant Italian laborers to begin digging with shovels and wheelbarrows. The effort ran out of money almost immediately, and the laborers were unpaid and forced to beg for food in Sandwich. In 1883, the Cape Cod Ship Canal Company reorganized under engineer Frederick Lockwood. The company used a bucket dredge to clear nearly a mile of channel through the Sandwich marshes before shutting down in 1891.

===Private construction===
On June 22, 1909, construction finally began for a working canal under the direction of August Belmont Jr.&#x27;s Boston, Cape Cod &amp; New York Canal Company, using designs by engineer William Barclay Parsons. The canal engineers encountered many problems, such as huge boulders underwater. Divers were hired to blow them up, but the effort slowed dredging. Another problem was cold winter storms which forced the engineers to stop dredging altogether and wait for spring. Nevertheless, the canal opened on a limited basis on July 29, 1914, and it was completed in 1916. The privately owned toll canal had a maximum width of and a maximum depth of , and it took a somewhat difficult route from Phinney Harbor at the head of Buzzards Bay. Several accidents occurred due to the narrow channel and navigation difficulty, and these limited traffic and tarnished the canal&#x27;s reputation. Toll revenues failed to meet investors&#x27; expectations as a result, despite shortening the trade route from New York City to Boston by .

===Public takeover and expansion===
On July 25, 1918, the Director General of the United States Railroad Administration took over jurisdiction and operation of the canal under a presidential proclamation. Four days earlier, the German U-boat surfaced off Orleans, Massachusetts on July 21, 1918, and shelled the tugboat &quot;Perth Amboy&quot; and her string of four barges. The canal remained under government control until 1920, during which the United States Army Corps of Engineers re-dredged the channel to deep. 

In 1928, the government purchased the canal for $11.4 million as a free public waterway, and $21 million was spent between 1935 and 1940 increasing the canal&#x27;s width to and its depth to . As a result, it became the widest sea-level canal of its time. The southern entrance to the canal was rebuilt for direct access from Buzzards Bay rather than through Phinney Harbor. Before construction began, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology built a huge scale model of the canal (9 feet to a mile, roughly actual size) to study the hydraulic effects of tidal currents on the enlarged and rerouted canal.

===World War II===
During World War II, shipping again used the canal to avoid U-boats patrolling offshore. It was protected by coastal artillery batteries at the Sagamore Hill Military Reservation at the northern entrance and the Butler Point Military Reservation at the southern entrance. The artillery was never fired in defense of the canal.

The Mystic Steamship Company&#x27;s collier SS &quot;Stephen R. Jones&quot; was grounded and sank in the canal on June 28, 1942. Shipping was routed around Cape Cod, and the Liberty ship SS &quot;Alexander Macomb&quot; was torpedoed by the German submarine &quot;U-215&quot; on July 3 with the loss of ten lives. The canal reopened on July 31 after the wrecked &quot;Stephen R. Jones&quot; was removed with the help of 17 tons of dynamite.

==Recreational uses==
The canal is used extensively by recreational and commercial vessels. Service roads on both sides of the canal provide access for fishing and are heavily used by in-line skaters, bicyclists, and walkers. Several parking areas are maintained at access points. Bourne Scenic Park is leased by the Corps of Engineers to the Town of Bourne Recreation Authority for use as a tent and RV campground adjacent to the Canal.

The Army Corps of Engineers maintains the Cape Cod Canal Visitor Center which introduces visitors to the history, features, and operation of the canal. Features include a retired US Army Corps of Engineers patrol boat, a 46-seat theater showing continuous DVD presentations on canal history, canal flora and fauna, real time radar and camera images of the waterway, and a variety of interactive exhibits. Corps Park Rangers staff the center and provide free public programs on a variety of subjects. The Visitor Center is open seasonally from May to October, and admission is free. It is located on Moffitt Drive in Sandwich near the canal&#x27;s east end. A second seasonally staffed center is at the Herring Run along Scenic Highway.

Scusset Beach State Reservation lies just north of the east end of the canal and offers beach facilities as well as tent and RV camping. A trail there leads to Sagamore Hill, once an Indian meeting ground and the site of a World War II coastal fortification. Bournedale Hills Trail extends along the north side of the Canal from Bourne Scenic Park campground to the Herring Run. The trail includes a self-guided loop which interprets the Canal&#x27;s historic and natural features.

=== Tunnel folklore and proposal ===
A spoof became popular during the late 20th century concerning a fictitious road tunnel, allegedly built in the 1960s, under the Cape Cod Canal. It came into popular usage in Massachusetts as a commentary on the severe traffic entering and exiting Cape Cod during the summer months. Since 1994, decals have been sold in shops around the Cape as popular souvenirs purporting to be &quot;permits&quot; allowing the bearer to use the tunnel; the popularity of these &quot;permits&quot; briefly led to a lawsuit among several different sellers. In 2019, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) said that it had studied the idea of adding a tunnel, but had no plans to do so.

<text>Andrew Colin Renfrew, Baron Renfrew of Kaimsthorn, (25 July 1937 – 24 November 2024) was a British archaeologist, paleolinguist and Conservative peer noted for his work on radiocarbon dating, the prehistory of languages, archaeogenetics, neuroarchaeology, and the prevention of looting at archaeological sites.

Renfrew was also the Disney Professor of Archaeology at the University of Cambridge and Director of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research and was a Senior Fellow of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.

==Early life and education==
Renfrew was educated at St Albans School, Hertfordshire (where one of the houses is named after him) and from 1956 to 1958 did National Service in the Royal Air Force. He then went up to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he read Natural Sciences then Archaeology and Anthropology, graduating in 1962. He was elected president of Cambridge Union in 1961 and was a member of the University of Cambridge Archaeological Field Club (AFC). He had run against and lost an election to Barry Cunliffe to become president of the AFC. In 1965, he completed his PhD thesis &quot;Neolithic and Bronze Age cultures of the Cyclades and their external relations&quot;; in the same year he married Jane M. Ewbank.

==Academic==
In 1965, Renfrew was appointed to the post of lecturer in the Department of Prehistory and Archaeology at the University of Sheffield. Between 1968 and 1970, he directed excavations at Sitagroi, Greece. In the 1968 Sheffield Brightside by-election he unsuccessfully contested this parliamentary constituency on behalf of the Conservative Party. In that year he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, in 1970 was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland and in 2000 elected an Honorary Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.

In 1972, Renfrew became Professor of Archaeology at the University of Southampton, succeeding Barry Cunliffe. During his time at Southampton he directed excavations at Quanterness in Orkney and Phylakopi on the island of Milos, Greece. In 1973, Renfrew published &quot;Before Civilisation: The Radiocarbon Revolution and Prehistoric Europe&quot; in which he challenged the assumption that prehistoric cultural innovation originated in the Near East and then spread to Europe. He also excavated with Marija Gimbutas at Sitagroi.

In 1980, Renfrew was elected a Fellow of the British Academy. In 1981 he was elected to the Disney Professorship of Archaeology in the University of Cambridge, a post he held until his retirement. In 1990 Renfrew was appointed the founding Director of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.

In 1987, he published &quot;Archaeology and Language: The Puzzle of the Indo-European Origins&quot;, a book on the Proto-Indo-Europeans. His &quot;Anatolian hypothesis&quot; posited that this group lived 2,000 years before the Kurgans, in Anatolia, later diffusing to Greece, then Italy, Sicily, Corsica, the Mediterranean coast of France, Spain, and Portugal. Another branch migrated along the fertile river valleys of the Danube and Rhine into central and northern Europe.

He developed the Anatolian hypothesis, which argues that Proto-Indo-European, the reconstructed ancestor of the Indo-European languages, originated approximately 9,000 years ago in Anatolia and moved with the spread of farming throughout the Mediterranean and into central and northern Europe. This hypothesis contradicted Marija Gimbutas&#x27;s Kurgan hypothesis, which states that Proto-Indo-European was spread by a migration of peoples from the Pontic–Caspian steppe approximately 6,000 years ago.

From 1987 to 1991, he co-directed excavations at Markiani on Amorgos and at Dhaskalio Kavos, Keros, Greece.

Renfrew&#x27;s work in using the archaeological record as the basis for understanding the ancient mind was foundational to the field of evolutionary cognitive archaeology. Renfrew and his student, Lambros Malafouris, coined the phrase neuroarchaeology to describe an archaeology of mind.

In 1996, Renfrew formulated a sapient paradox, that can be formulated as &quot;&quot;why there was such a long gap between emergence of genetically and anatomically modern humans and the development of complex behaviors?&quot;

Renfrew served as Master of Jesus College, Cambridge from 1986 until 1997. In 2004, he retired from the Disney Professorship and was a Senior Fellow at the McDonald Institute. From 2006 to 2008 he directed new excavations on the Cycladic Island of Keros and was recently co-director of the Keros Island Survey. He died on 24 November 2024, at the age of 87.

<text>Optical rotation, also known as polarization rotation or circular birefringence, is the rotation of the orientation of the plane of polarization about the optical axis of linearly polarized light as it travels through certain materials. Circular birefringence and circular dichroism are the manifestations of optical activity. Optical activity occurs only in chiral materials, those lacking microscopic mirror symmetry. Unlike other sources of birefringence which alter a beam&#x27;s state of polarization, optical activity can be observed in fluids. This can include gases or solutions of chiral molecules such as sugars, molecules with helical secondary structure such as some proteins, and also chiral liquid crystals. It can also be observed in chiral solids such as certain crystals with a rotation between adjacent crystal planes (such as quartz) or metamaterials.

When looking at the source of light, the rotation of the plane of polarization may be either to the right (dextrorotatory or dextrorotary — &quot;d&quot;-rotary, represented by (+), clockwise), or to the left (levorotatory or levorotary — &quot;l&quot;-rotary, represented by (−), counter-clockwise) depending on which stereoisomer is dominant. For instance, sucrose and camphor are &quot;d&quot;-rotary whereas cholesterol is &quot;l&quot;-rotary. For a given substance, the angle by which the polarization of light of a specified wavelength is rotated is proportional to the path length through the material and (for a solution) proportional to its concentration.

Optical activity is measured using a polarized source and polarimeter. This is a tool particularly used in the sugar industry to measure the sugar concentration of syrup, and generally in chemistry to measure the concentration or enantiomeric ratio of chiral molecules in solution. Modulation of a liquid crystal&#x27;s optical activity, viewed between two sheet polarizers, is the principle of operation of liquid-crystal displays (used in most modern televisions and computer monitors).

== Forms ==
Dextrorotation and laevorotation (also spelled levorotation) in chemistry and physics are the optical rotation of plane-polarized light. From the point of view of the observer, &quot;dextrorotation&quot; refers to clockwise or right-handed rotation, and &quot;laevorotation&quot; refers to counterclockwise or left-handed rotation.

A chemical compound that causes dextrorotation is &quot;dextrorotatory&quot; or &quot;dextrorotary&quot;, while a compound that causes laevorotation is &quot;laevorotatory&quot; or &quot;laevorotary&quot;. Compounds with these properties consist of chiral molecules and are said to have optical activity. If a chiral molecule is dextrorotary, its enantiomer (geometric mirror image) will be laevorotary, and vice versa. Enantiomers rotate plane-polarized light the same number of degrees, but in opposite directions.

===Chirality prefixes===

A compound may be labeled as dextrorotary by using the &quot;(+)-&quot; or &quot;&quot;d&quot;-&quot; prefix. Likewise, a levorotary compound may be labeled using the &quot;(−)-&quot; or &quot;&quot;l&quot;-&quot; prefix. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, the authority on chemical nomenclature, strongly discourages use of the &quot;&quot;d&quot;-&quot; and &quot;&quot;l&quot;-&quot; prefixes. The lowercase &quot;&quot;d&quot;-&quot; and &quot;&quot;l&quot;-&quot; prefixes are distinct from the &quot;-&quot; and &quot;-&quot; prefixes. The &quot;-&quot; and &quot;-&quot; prefixes are used to specify the enantiomer of chiral organic compounds in biochemistry and are based on the compound&#x27;s absolute configuration relative to (+)-glyceraldehyde, which is the -form by definition.

The prefix used to indicate absolute configuration is not directly related to the (+) or (−) prefix used to indicate optical rotation in the same molecule. For example, nine of the nineteen -amino acids naturally occurring in proteins are, despite the - prefix, actually dextrorotary (at a wavelength of 589 nm), and -fructose is sometimes called &quot;levulose&quot; because it is levorotary. The two naming systems can be combined to indicate both absolute configuration and optical rotation, as in -(+)-glyceraldehyde.

The - and - prefixes describe the molecule as a whole, as do the (+) and (−) prefixes for optical rotation. In contrast, the (&quot;R&quot;)- and (&quot;S&quot;)- prefixes from the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules characterize the absolute configuration of each specific chiral stereocenter with the molecule, rather than a property of the molecule as a whole. A molecule having exactly one chiral stereocenter (usually an asymmetric carbon atom) can be labeled (&quot;R&quot;) or (&quot;S&quot;), but a molecule having multiple stereocenters needs more than one label. For example, the essential amino acid -threonine contains two chiral stereocenters and is written (2&quot;S&quot;,3&quot;S&quot;)-threonine. There is no strict relationship between the R/S, the /, and (+)/(−) designations, although some correlations exist. For example, of the naturally occurring amino acids, all are , and most are (&quot;S&quot;). For some molecules the (&quot;R&quot;)-enantiomer is the dextrorotary (+) enantiomer, and in other cases it is the levorotary (−) enantiomer. The relationship must be determined on a case-by-case basis with experimental measurements or detailed computer modeling.

== History ==
The rotation of the orientation of linearly polarized light was first observed in 1811 in quartz by French physicist François Arago. In 1820, the English astronomer Sir John F.W. Herschel discovered that different individual quartz crystals, whose crystalline structures are mirror images of each other (see illustration), rotate linear polarization by equal amounts but in opposite directions. Jean Baptiste Biot also observed the rotation of the axis of polarization in certain liquids and vapors of organic substances such as turpentine. In 1822, Augustin-Jean Fresnel found that optical rotation could be explained as a species of birefringence: whereas previously known cases of birefringence were due to the different speeds of light polarized in two perpendicular planes, optical rotation was due to the different speeds of right-hand and left-hand circularly polarized light. Simple polarimeters have been used since this time to measure the concentrations of simple sugars, such as glucose, in solution. In fact one name for -glucose (the biological isomer), is &quot;dextrose&quot;, referring to the fact that it causes linearly polarized light to rotate to the right or side. In a similar manner, levulose, more commonly known as fructose, causes the plane of polarization to rotate to the left. Fructose is even more strongly levorotatory than glucose is dextrorotatory. Invert sugar syrup, commercially formed by the hydrolysis of sucrose syrup to a mixture of the component simple sugars, fructose, and glucose, gets its name from the fact that the conversion causes the direction of rotation to &quot;invert&quot; from right to left.

In 1849, Louis Pasteur resolved a problem concerning the nature of tartaric acid. A solution of this compound derived from living things (to be specific, wine lees) rotates the plane of polarization of light passing through it, but tartaric acid derived by chemical synthesis has no such effect, even though its reactions are identical and its elemental composition is the same. Pasteur noticed that crystals of this compound come in two asymmetric forms that are mirror images of one another. Sorting the crystals by hand gave two forms of the compound: Solutions of one form rotate polarized light clockwise, while the other form rotate light counterclockwise. An equal mix of the two has no polarizing effect on light. Pasteur deduced that the molecule in question is asymmetric and could exist in two different forms that resemble one another as would left- and right-hand gloves, and that the organic form of the compound consists of purely the one type.

In 1874, Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff and Joseph Achille Le Bel independently proposed that this phenomenon of optical activity in carbon compounds could be explained by assuming that the 4 saturated chemical bonds between carbon atoms and their neighbors are directed towards the corners of a regular tetrahedron. If the 4 neighbors are all different, then there are two possible orderings of the neighbors around the tetrahedron, which will be mirror images of each other. This led to a better understanding of the three-dimensional nature of molecules.

In 1898, Jagadish Chandra Bose described the ability of twisted artificial structures to rotate the polarization of microwaves. In 1914, Karl F. Lindman showed the same effect for an artificial composite consisting of randomly-dispersed left- or right-handed wire helices in cotton. Since the early 21st century, the development of artificial materials has led to the prediction and realization of chiral metamaterials with optical activity exceeding that of natural media by orders of magnitude in the optical part of the spectrum. Extrinsic chirality associated with oblique illumination of metasurfaces lacking two-fold rotational symmetry has been observed to lead to large linear optical activity in transmission and reflection, as well as nonlinear optical activity exceeding that of lithium iodate by 30 million times.

In 1945, Charles William Bunn predicted optical activity of achiral structures, if the wave&#x27;s propagation direction and the achiral structure form an experimental arrangement that is different from its mirror image. Such optical activity due to extrinsic chirality was observed in the 1960s in liquid crystals.

In 1950, Sergey Vavilov predicted optical activity that depends on the intensity of light and the effect of nonlinear optical activity was observed in 1979 in lithium iodate crystals.

Optical activity is normally observed for transmitted light. However, in 1988, M. P. Silverman discovered that polarization rotation can also occur for light reflected from chiral substances. Shortly after, it was observed that chiral media can also reflect left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized waves with different efficiencies. These phenomena of specular circular birefringence and specular circular dichroism are jointly known as specular optical activity. Specular optical activity is very weak in natural materials.

== Theory ==

Optical activity occurs due to molecules dissolved in a fluid or due to the fluid itself only if the molecules are one of two (or more) stereoisomers; this is known as an enantiomer. The structure of such a molecule is such that it is &quot;not&quot; identical to its mirror image (which would be that of a different stereoisomer, or the &quot;opposite enantiomer&quot;). In mathematics, this property is also known as chirality. For instance, a metal rod is &quot;not&quot; chiral, since its appearance in a mirror is not distinct from itself. However a screw or light bulb base (or any sort of helix) &quot;is&quot; chiral; an ordinary right-handed screw thread, viewed in a mirror, would appear as a left-handed screw (very uncommon) which could not possibly screw into an ordinary (right-handed) nut. A human viewed in a mirror would have their heart on the right side, clear evidence of chirality, whereas the mirror reflection of a doll might well be indistinguishable from the doll itself.

In order to display optical activity, a fluid must contain only one, or a preponderance of one, stereoisomer. If two enantiomers are present in equal proportions, then their effects cancel out and no optical activity is observed; this is termed a racemic mixture. But when there is an enantiomeric excess, more of one enantiomer than the other, the cancellation is incomplete and optical activity is observed. Many naturally occurring molecules are present as only one enantiomer (such as many sugars). Chiral molecules produced within the fields of organic chemistry or inorganic chemistry are racemic unless a chiral reagent was employed in the same reaction.

At the fundamental level, polarization rotation in an optically active medium is caused by circular birefringence, and can best be understood in that way. Whereas linear birefringence in a crystal involves a small difference in the phase velocity of light of two different linear polarizations, circular birefringence implies a small difference in the velocities between right and left-handed &quot;circular polarizations&quot;. Think of one enantiomer in a solution as a large number of little helices (or screws), all right-handed, but in random orientations. Birefringence of this sort is possible even in a fluid because the handedness of the helices is not dependent on their orientation: even when the direction of one helix is reversed, it still appears right handed. And circularly polarized light itself is chiral: as the wave proceeds in one direction the electric (and magnetic) fields composing it are rotating clockwise (or counterclockwise for the opposite circular polarization), tracing out a right (or left) handed screw pattern in space. In addition to the bulk refractive index which substantially lowers the phase velocity of light in any dielectric (transparent) material compared to the speed of light (in vacuum), &quot;there is an additional interaction between the chirality of the wave and the chirality of the molecules.&quot; Where their chiralities are the same, there will be a small additional effect on the wave&#x27;s velocity, but the opposite circular polarization will experience an opposite small effect as its chirality is opposite that of the molecules.

Unlike linear birefringence, however, natural optical rotation (in the absence of a magnetic field) cannot be explained in terms of a local material permittivity tensor (i.e., a charge response that only depends on the local electric field vector), as symmetry considerations forbid this. Rather, circular birefringence only appears when considering nonlocality of the material response, a phenomenon known as spatial dispersion. Nonlocality means that electric fields in one location of the material drive currents in another location of the material. Light travels at a finite speed, and even though it is much faster than the electrons, it makes a difference whether the charge response naturally wants to travel along with the electromagnetic wavefront, or opposite to it. Spatial dispersion means that light travelling in different directions (different wavevectors) sees a slightly different permittivity tensor. Natural optical rotation requires a special material, but it also relies on the fact that the wavevector of light is nonzero, and a nonzero wavevector bypasses the symmetry restrictions on the local (zero-wavevector) response. However, there is still reversal symmetry, which is why the direction of natural optical rotation must be &#x27;reversed&#x27; when the direction of the light is reversed, in contrast to magnetic Faraday rotation. All optical phenomena have some nonlocality/wavevector influence but it is usually negligible; natural optical rotation, rather uniquely, absolutely requires it.

The phase velocity of light in a medium is commonly expressed using the index of refraction &quot;n&quot;, defined as the speed of light (in free space) divided by its speed in the medium. The difference in the refractive indices between the two circular polarizations quantifies the strength of the circular birefringence (polarization rotation),
: formula_1
While formula_2 is small in natural materials, examples of giant circular birefringence resulting in a negative refractive index for one circular polarization have been reported for chiral metamaterials.
The familiar rotation of the axis of &quot;linear&quot; polarization relies on the understanding that a linearly polarized wave can as well be described as the superposition (addition) of a left and right circularly polarized wave in equal proportion. The phase difference between these two waves is dependent on the orientation of the linear polarization which we&#x27;ll call formula_3, and their electric fields have a relative phase difference of formula_4 which then add to produce linear polarization:
: formula_5
where formula_6 is the electric field of the net wave, while formula_7 and formula_8 are the two circularly polarized basis functions (having zero phase difference). Assuming propagation in the +&quot;z&quot; direction, we could write formula_7 and formula_8 in terms of their &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; components as follows:
: formula_11
: formula_12
where formula_13 and formula_14 are unit vectors, and &quot;i&quot; is the imaginary unit, in this case representing the 90-degree phase shift between the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; components that we have decomposed each circular polarization into. As usual when dealing with phasor notation, it is understood that such quantities are to be multiplied by formula_15 and then the actual electric field at any instant is given by the &quot;real part&quot; of that product.

Substituting these expressions for formula_7 and formula_8 into the equation for formula_18 we obtain
: formula_19
The last equation shows that the resulting vector has the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; components in phase and oriented exactly in the formula_3 direction, as we had intended, justifying the representation of any linearly polarized state at angle formula_21 as the superposition of right and left circularly polarized components with a relative phase difference of formula_22. Now let us assume transmission through an optically active material which induces an additional phase difference between the right and left circularly polarized waves of formula_23. Let us call formula_24 the result of passing the original wave linearly polarized at angle formula_21 through this medium. This will apply additional phase factors of formula_26 and formula_27 to the right and left circularly polarized components of formula_6:
: formula_29
Using similar math as above, we find
: formula_30
describing a wave linearly polarized at angle formula_31, thus rotated by formula_32 relative to the incoming wave formula_33

We defined above the difference in the refractive indices for right and left circularly polarized waves of formula_2. Considering propagation through a length &quot;L&quot; in such a material, there will be an additional phase difference induced between them of formula_23 (as we used above) given by
: formula_36
where formula_37 is the wavelength of the light (in vacuum). This will cause a rotation of the linear axis of polarization by formula_27 as we have shown.

In general, the refractive index depends on wavelength (see dispersion) and the differential refractive index formula_2 will also be wavelength dependent. The resulting variation in rotation with the wavelength of the light is called optical rotatory dispersion (ORD). ORD spectra and circular dichroism spectra are related through the Kramers–Kronig relations. Complete knowledge of one spectrum allows the calculation of the other.

So we find that the degree of rotation depends on the color of the light (the yellow sodium D line near 589 nm wavelength is commonly used for measurements) and is directly proportional to the path length formula_40 through the substance and the amount of circular birefringence of the material formula_2 which, for a solution, may be computed from the substance&#x27;s specific rotation and its concentration in solution.

Although optical activity is normally thought of as a property of fluids, particularly aqueous solutions, it has also been observed in crystals such as quartz (SiO2). Although quartz has a substantial linear birefringence, that effect is cancelled when propagation is along the optic axis. In that case, rotation of the plane of polarization is observed due to the relative rotation between crystal planes, thus making the crystal formally chiral as we have defined it above. The rotation of the crystal planes can be right or left-handed, again producing opposite optical activities. On the other hand, amorphous forms of silica such as fused quartz, like a racemic mixture of chiral molecules, has no net optical activity since one or the other crystal structure does not dominate the substance&#x27;s internal molecular structure.

== Applications ==
For a pure substance in solution, if the color and path length are fixed and the specific rotation is known, the observed rotation can be used to calculate the concentration. This usage makes a polarimeter a tool of great importance to those trading in or using sugar syrups in bulk.

==Comparison to the Faraday effect==
Rotation of light&#x27;s plane of polarization may also occur through the Faraday effect, which involves a static magnetic field. However, this is a distinct phenomenon and is not classified as &quot;optical activity&quot;. Optical activity is reciprocal, i.e. it is the same for opposite directions of wave propagation through an optically active medium, for example, clockwise polarization rotation from the point of view of an observer. In case of optically active isotropic media, the rotation is the same for any direction of wave propagation. In contrast, the Faraday effect is non-reciprocal, i.e. opposite directions of wave propagation through a Faraday medium will result in clockwise and anti-clockwise polarization rotation from the point of view of an observer. Faraday rotation depends on the propagation direction relative to that of the applied magnetic field. All compounds can exhibit polarization rotation in the presence of an applied magnetic field, provided that (a component of) the magnetic field is oriented in the direction of light propagation. The Faraday effect is one of the first discoveries of the relationship between light and electromagnetic effects.

<text>In computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyberattack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to a network. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled. The range of attacks varies widely, spanning from inundating a server with millions of requests to slow its performance, overwhelming a server with a substantial amount of invalid data, to submitting requests with an illegitimate IP address.

In a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack), the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. More sophisticated strategies are required to mitigate this type of attack; simply attempting to block a single source is insufficient as there are multiple sources. A DDoS attack is analogous to a group of people crowding the entry door of a shop, making it hard for legitimate customers to enter, thus disrupting trade and losing the business money. Criminal perpetrators of DDoS attacks often target sites or services hosted on high-profile web servers such as banks or credit card payment gateways. Revenge and blackmail, as well as hacktivism, can motivate these attacks.

==History==
Panix, the third-oldest ISP in the world, was the target of what is thought to be the first DoS attack. On September 6, 1996, Panix was subject to a SYN flood attack, which brought down its services for several days while hardware vendors, notably Cisco, figured out a proper defense. Another early demonstration of the DoS attack was made by Khan C. Smith in 1997 during a DEF CON event, disrupting Internet access to the Las Vegas Strip for over an hour. The release of sample code during the event led to the online attack of Sprint, EarthLink, E-Trade, and other major corporations in the year to follow. The largest DDoS attack to date happened in September 2017, when Google Cloud experienced an attack with a peak volume of , revealed by Google on October 17, 2020. The record holder was thought to be an attack executed by an unnamed customer of the US-based service provider Arbor Networks, reaching a peak of about .

In February 2020, Amazon Web Services experienced an attack with a peak volume of . In July 2021, CDN Provider Cloudflare boasted of protecting its client from a DDoS attack from a global Mirai botnet that was up to 17.2 million requests per second. Russian DDoS prevention provider Yandex said it blocked a HTTP pipelining DDoS attack on Sept. 5. 2021 that originated from unpatched Mikrotik networking gear. In the first half of 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine significantly shaped the cyberthreat landscape, with an increase in cyberattacks attributed to both state-sponsored actors and global hacktivist activities. The most notable event was a DDoS attack in February, the largest Ukraine has encountered, disrupting government and financial sector services. This wave of cyber aggression extended to Western allies like the UK, the US, and Germany. Particularly, the UK&#x27;s financial sector saw an increase in DDoS attacks from nation-state actors and hacktivists, aimed at undermining Ukraine&#x27;s allies.

In February 2023, Cloudflare faced a 71 million/requests per second attack which Cloudflare claims was the largest HTTP DDoS attack at the time. HTTP DDoS attacks are measured by HTTP requests per second instead of packets per second or bits per second. On July 10, 2023, the fanfiction platform Archive of Our Own (AO3) faced DDoS attacks, disrupting services. Anonymous Sudan, claiming the attack for religious and political reasons, was viewed skeptically by AO3 and experts. Flashpoint, a threat intelligence vendor, noted the group&#x27;s past activities but doubted their stated motives. AO3, supported by the non-profit Organization for Transformative Works (OTW) and reliant on donations, is unlikely to meet the $30,000 Bitcoin ransom. In August 2023, the group of hacktivists NoName057 targeted several Italian financial institutions, through the execution of slow DoS attacks. On 14 January 2024, they executed a DDoS attack on Swiss federal websites, prompted by President Zelensky&#x27;s attendance at the Davos World Economic Forum. Switzerland&#x27;s National Cyber Security Centre quickly mitigated the attack, ensuring core federal services remained secure, despite temporary accessibility issues on some websites. In October 2023, exploitation of a new vulnerability in the HTTP/2 protocol resulted in the record for largest HTTP DDoS attack being broken twice, once with a 201 million requests per second attack observed by Cloudflare, and again with a 398 million requests per second attack observed by Google. In August 2024, Global Secure Layer observed and reported on a record-breaking packet DDoS at 3.15 billion packets per second, which targeted an undisclosed number of unofficial Minecraft game servers. In October 2024, the Internet Archive faced two severe DDoS attacks that brought the site completely offline, immediately following a previous attack that leaked records of over 31 million of the site&#x27;s users. The hacktivist group SN_Blackmeta claimed the DDoS attack as retribution for American involvement in the Israel–Hamas war, despite the Internet Archive being unaffiliated with the United States government; however, their link with the preceding data leak remains unclear.

==Types==
Denial-of-service attacks are characterized by an explicit attempt by attackers to prevent legitimate use of a service. There are two general forms of DoS attacks: those that crash services and those that flood services. The most serious attacks are distributed.
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers. A DDoS attack uses more than one unique IP address or machines, often from thousands of hosts infected with malware. A distributed denial of service attack typically involves more than around 3–5 nodes on different networks; fewer nodes may qualify as a DoS attack but is not a DDoS attack.

Multiple attack machines can generate more attack traffic than a single machine and are harder to disable, and the behavior of each attack machine can be stealthier, making the attack harder to track and shut down. Since the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from different sources, it may be impossible to stop the attack simply by using ingress filtering. It also makes it difficult to distinguish legitimate user traffic from attack traffic when spread across multiple points of origin. As an alternative or augmentation of a DDoS, attacks may involve forging of IP sender addresses (IP address spoofing) further complicating identifying and defeating the attack. These attacker advantages cause challenges for defense mechanisms. For example, merely purchasing more incoming bandwidth than the current volume of the attack might not help, because the attacker might be able to simply add more attack machines. The scale of DDoS attacks has continued to rise over recent years, by 2016 exceeding a terabit per second. Some common examples of DDoS attacks are UDP flooding, SYN flooding and DNS amplification.

====Yo-yo attack====
A yo-yo attack is a specific type of DoS/DDoS aimed at cloud-hosted applications which use autoscaling. The attacker generates a flood of traffic until a cloud-hosted service scales outwards to handle the increase of traffic, then halts the attack, leaving the victim with over-provisioned resources. When the victim scales back down, the attack resumes, causing resources to scale back up again. This can result in a reduced quality of service during the periods of scaling up and down and a financial drain on resources during periods of over-provisioning while operating with a lower cost for an attacker compared to a normal DDoS attack, as it only needs to be generating traffic for a portion of the attack period.

===Application layer attacks===
An application layer DDoS attack (sometimes referred to as layer 7 DDoS attack) is a form of DDoS attack where attackers target application-layer processes. The attack over-exercises specific functions or features of a website with the intention to disable those functions or features. This application-layer attack is different from an entire network attack, and is often used against financial institutions to distract IT and security personnel from security breaches. In 2013, application-layer DDoS attacks represented 20% of all DDoS attacks. According to research by Akamai Technologies, there have been &quot;51 percent more application layer attacks&quot; from Q4 2013 to Q4 2014 and &quot;16 percent more&quot; from Q3 2014 to Q4 2014. In November 2017; Junade Ali, an engineer at Cloudflare noted that whilst network-level attacks continue to be of high capacity, they were occurring less frequently. Ali further noted that although network-level attacks were becoming less frequent, data from Cloudflare demonstrated that application-layer attacks were still showing no sign of slowing down.

====Application layer====
The OSI model (ISO/IEC 7498-1) is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the internal functions of a communication system by partitioning it into abstraction layers. The model is a product of the Open Systems Interconnection project at the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The model groups similar communication functions into one of seven logical layers. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the communications path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that traverse that path. In the OSI model, the definition of its application layer is narrower in scope than is often implemented. The OSI model defines the application layer as being the user interface. The OSI application layer is responsible for displaying data and images to the user in a human-recognizable format and to interface with the presentation layer below it. In an implementation, the application and presentation layers are frequently combined.

====Method of attack====
The simplest DoS attack relies primarily on brute force, flooding the target with an overwhelming flux of packets, oversaturating its connection bandwidth or depleting the target&#x27;s system resources. Bandwidth-saturating floods rely on the attacker&#x27;s ability to generate the overwhelming flux of packets. A common way of achieving this today is via distributed denial-of-service, employing a botnet. An application layer DDoS attack is done mainly for specific targeted purposes, including disrupting transactions and access to databases. It requires fewer resources than network layer attacks but often accompanies them. An attack may be disguised to look like legitimate traffic, except it targets specific application packets or functions. The attack on the application layer can disrupt services such as the retrieval of information or search functions on a website.

===Advanced persistent DoS===
An advanced persistent DoS (APDoS) is associated with an advanced persistent threat and requires specialized DDoS mitigation. These attacks can persist for weeks; the longest continuous period noted so far lasted 38 days. This attack involved approximately 50+ petabits (50,000+ terabits) of malicious traffic. Attackers in this scenario may tactically switch between several targets to create a diversion to evade defensive DDoS countermeasures but all the while eventually concentrating the main thrust of the attack onto a single victim. In this scenario, attackers with continuous access to several very powerful network resources are capable of sustaining a prolonged campaign generating enormous levels of unamplified DDoS traffic. APDoS attacks are characterized by:
* advanced reconnaissance (pre-attack OSINT and extensive decoyed scanning crafted to evade detection over long periods)
* tactical execution (attack with both primary and secondary victims but the focus is on primary)
* explicit motivation (a calculated end game/goal target)
* large computing capacity (access to substantial computer power and network bandwidth)
* simultaneous multi-threaded OSI layer attacks (sophisticated tools operating at layers 3 through 7)
* persistence over extended periods (combining all the above into a concerted, well-managed attack across a range of targets).

===Denial-of-service as a service===

Some vendors provide so-called &quot;booter&quot; or &quot;stresser&quot; services, which have simple web-based front ends, and accept payment over the web. Marketed and promoted as stress-testing tools, they can be used to perform unauthorized denial-of-service attacks, and allow technically unsophisticated attackers access to sophisticated attack tools. Usually powered by a botnet, the traffic produced by a consumer stresser can range anywhere from 5-50 Gbit/s, which can, in most cases, deny the average home user internet access.

===Markov-modulated denial-of-service attack===
A Markov-modulated denial-of-service attack occurs when the attacker disrupts control packets using a hidden Markov model. A setting in which Markov-model based attacks are prevalent is online gaming as the disruption of the control packet undermines game play and system functionality.

==Symptoms==
The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) has identified symptoms of a denial-of-service attack to include:
* unusually slow network performance (opening files or accessing websites),
* unavailability of a particular website, or
* inability to access any website.

==Attack techniques==

===Attack tools===
In cases such as MyDoom and Slowloris, the tools are embedded in malware and launch their attacks without the knowledge of the system owner. Stacheldraht is a classic example of a DDoS tool. It uses a layered structure where the attacker uses a client program to connect to handlers which are compromised systems that issue commands to the zombie agents which in turn facilitate the DDoS attack. Agents are compromised via the handlers by the attacker using automated routines to exploit vulnerabilities in programs that accept remote connections running on the targeted remote hosts. Each handler can control up to a thousand agents.

In other cases a machine may become part of a DDoS attack with the owner&#x27;s consent, for example, in Operation Payback organized by the group Anonymous. The Low Orbit Ion Cannon has typically been used in this way. Along with High Orbit Ion Cannon a wide variety of DDoS tools are available today, including paid and free versions, with different features available. There is an underground market for these in hacker-related forums and IRC channels.

===Application-layer attacks===
Application-layer attacks employ DoS-causing exploits and can cause server-running software to fill the disk space or consume all available memory or CPU time. Attacks may use specific packet types or connection requests to saturate finite resources by, for example, occupying the maximum number of open connections or filling the victim&#x27;s disk space with logs. An attacker with shell-level access to a victim&#x27;s computer may slow it until it is unusable or crash it by using a fork bomb. Another kind of application-level DoS attack is XDoS (or XML DoS) which can be controlled by modern web application firewalls (WAFs). All attacks belonging to the category of &quot;timeout exploiting&quot;.

Slow DoS attacks implement an application-layer attack. Examples of threats are Slowloris, establishing pending connections with the victim, or SlowDroid, an attack running on mobile devices. Another target of DDoS attacks may be to produce added costs for the application operator, when the latter uses resources based on cloud computing. In this case, normally application-used resources are tied to a needed quality of service (QoS) level (e.g. responses should be less than 200 ms) and this rule is usually linked to automated software (e.g. Amazon CloudWatch) to raise more virtual resources from the provider to meet the defined QoS levels for the increased requests. The main incentive behind such attacks may be to drive the application owner to raise the elasticity levels to handle the increased application traffic, to cause financial losses, or force them to become less competitive. A &quot;banana attack&quot; is another particular type of DoS. It involves redirecting outgoing messages from the client back onto the client, preventing outside access, as well as flooding the client with the sent packets. A LAND attack is of this type.

===Degradation-of-service attacks===
Pulsing zombies are compromised computers that are directed to launch intermittent and short-lived floodings of victim websites with the intent of merely slowing it rather than crashing it. This type of attack, referred to as &quot;degradation-of-service&quot;, can be more difficult to detect and can disrupt and hamper connection to websites for prolonged periods of time, potentially causing more overall disruption than a denial-of-service attack. Exposure of degradation-of-service attacks is complicated further by the matter of discerning whether the server is really being attacked or is experiencing higher than normal legitimate traffic loads.

===Distributed DoS attack===
If an attacker mounts an attack from a single host, it would be classified as a DoS attack. Any attack against availability would be classed as a denial-of-service attack. On the other hand, if an attacker uses many systems to simultaneously launch attacks against a remote host, this would be classified as a DDoS attack. Malware can carry DDoS attack mechanisms; one of the better-known examples of this was MyDoom. Its DoS mechanism was triggered on a specific date and time. This type of DDoS involved hardcoding the target IP address before releasing the malware and no further interaction was necessary to launch the attack. A system may also be compromised with a trojan containing a zombie agent. Attackers can also break into systems using automated tools that exploit flaws in programs that listen for connections from remote hosts. This scenario primarily concerns systems acting as servers on the web. Stacheldraht is a classic example of a DDoS tool. It uses a layered structure where the attacker uses a client program to connect to handlers, which are compromised systems that issue commands to the zombie agents, which in turn facilitate the DDoS attack. Agents are compromised via the handlers by the attacker. Each handler can control up to a thousand agents. In some cases a machine may become part of a DDoS attack with the owner&#x27;s consent, for example, in Operation Payback, organized by the group Anonymous. These attacks can use different types of internet packets such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.

These collections of compromised systems are known as botnets. DDoS tools like Stacheldraht still use classic DoS attack methods centered on IP spoofing and amplification like smurf attacks and fraggle attacks (types of bandwidth consumption attacks). SYN floods (a resource starvation attack) may also be used. Newer tools can use DNS servers for DoS purposes. Unlike MyDoom&#x27;s DDoS mechanism, botnets can be turned against any IP address. Script kiddies use them to deny the availability of well known websites to legitimate users. More sophisticated attackers use DDoS tools for the purposes of extortionincluding against their business rivals. It has been reported that there are new attacks from internet of things (IoT) devices that have been involved in denial of service attacks. In one noted attack that was made peaked at around 20,000 requests per second which came from around 900 CCTV cameras. UK&#x27;s GCHQ has tools built for DDoS, named PREDATORS FACE and ROLLING THUNDER.

Simple attacks such as SYN floods may appear with a wide range of source IP addresses, giving the appearance of a distributed DoS. These flood attacks do not require completion of the TCP three-way handshake and attempt to exhaust the destination SYN queue or the server bandwidth. Because the source IP addresses can be trivially spoofed, an attack could come from a limited set of sources, or may even originate from a single host. Stack enhancements such as SYN cookies may be effective mitigation against SYN queue flooding but do not address bandwidth exhaustion. In 2022, TCP attacks were the leading method in DDoS incidents, accounting for 63% of all DDoS activity. This includes tactics like TCP SYN, TCP ACK, and TCP floods. With TCP being the most widespread networking protocol, its attacks are expected to remain prevalent in the DDoS threat scene.

===DDoS extortion===
In 2015, DDoS botnets such as DD4BC grew in prominence, taking aim at financial institutions. Cyber-extortionists typically begin with a low-level attack and a warning that a larger attack will be carried out if a ransom is not paid in bitcoin. Security experts recommend targeted websites to not pay the ransom. The attackers tend to get into an extended extortion scheme once they recognize that the target is ready to pay.

===HTTP slow POST DoS attack===
First discovered in 2009, the HTTP slow POST attack sends a complete, legitimate HTTP POST header, which includes a &quot;Content-Length&quot; field to specify the size of the message body to follow. However, the attacker then proceeds to send the actual message body at an extremely slow rate (e.g. 1 byte/110 seconds). Due to the entire message being correct and complete, the target server will attempt to obey the &quot;Content-Length&quot; field in the header, and wait for the entire body of the message to be transmitted, which can take a very long time. The attacker establishes hundreds or even thousands of such connections until all resources for incoming connections on the victim server are exhausted, making any further connections impossible until all data has been sent. It is notable that unlike many other DDoS or DDoS attacks, which try to subdue the server by overloading its network or CPU, an HTTP slow POST attack targets the &quot;logical&quot; resources of the victim, which means the victim would still have enough network bandwidth and processing power to operate. Combined with the fact that the Apache HTTP Server will, by default, accept requests up to 2GB in size, this attack can be particularly powerful. HTTP slow POST attacks are difficult to differentiate from legitimate connections and are therefore able to bypass some protection systems. OWASP, an open source web application security project, released a tool to test the security of servers against this type of attack.

===Challenge Collapsar (CC) attack===
A Challenge Collapsar (CC) attack is an attack where standard HTTP requests are sent to a targeted web server frequently. The Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) in the requests require complicated time-consuming algorithms or database operations which may exhaust the resources of the targeted web server. In 2004, a Chinese hacker nicknamed KiKi invented a hacking tool to send these kinds of requests to attack a NSFOCUS firewall named Collapsar, and thus the hacking tool was known as Challenge Collapsar, or &quot;CC&quot; for short. Consequently, this type of attack got the name &quot;CC attack&quot;.

===Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) flood===
A smurf attack relies on misconfigured network devices that allow packets to be sent to all computer hosts on a particular network via the broadcast address of the network, rather than a specific machine. The attacker will send large numbers of IP packets with the source address faked to appear to be the address of the victim. Most devices on a network will, by default, respond to this by sending a reply to the source IP address. If the number of machines on the network that receive and respond to these packets is very large, the victim&#x27;s computer will be flooded with traffic. This overloads the victim&#x27;s computer and can even make it unusable during such an attack.

Ping flood is based on sending the victim an overwhelming number of ping packets, usually using the &quot;ping&quot; command from Unix-like hosts. It is very simple to launch, the primary requirement being access to greater bandwidth than the victim. Ping of death is based on sending the victim a malformed ping packet, which will lead to a system crash on a vulnerable system. The BlackNurse attack is an example of an attack taking advantage of the required Destination Port Unreachable ICMP packets.

===Nuke===
A nuke is an old-fashioned denial-of-service attack against computer networks consisting of fragmented or otherwise invalid ICMP packets sent to the target, achieved by using a modified ping utility to repeatedly send this corrupt data, thus slowing down the affected computer until it comes to a complete stop. A specific example of a nuke attack that gained some prominence is the WinNuke, which exploited the vulnerability in the NetBIOS handler in Windows 95. A string of out-of-band data was sent to TCP port 139 of the victim&#x27;s machine, causing it to lock up and display a Blue Screen of Death.

===Peer-to-peer attacks===

Attackers have found a way to exploit a number of bugs in peer-to-peer servers to initiate DDoS attacks. The most aggressive of these peer-to-peer-DDoS attacks exploits DC++ . With peer-to-peer there is no botnet and the attacker does not have to communicate with the clients it subverts. Instead, the attacker acts as a &quot;puppet master&quot;, instructing clients of large peer-to-peer file sharing hubs to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and to connect to the victim&#x27;s website instead.

===Permanent denial-of-service attacks===
Permanent denial-of-service (PDoS), also known loosely as phlashing, is an attack that damages a system so badly that it requires replacement or reinstallation of hardware. Unlike the distributed denial-of-service attack, a PDoS attack exploits security flaws which allow remote administration on the management interfaces of the victim&#x27;s hardware, such as routers, printers, or other networking hardware. The attacker uses these vulnerabilities to replace a device&#x27;s firmware with a modified, corrupt, or defective firmware image—a process which when done legitimately is known as &quot;flashing.&quot; The intent is to brick the device, rendering it unusable for its original purpose until it can be repaired or replaced. The PDoS is a pure hardware-targeted attack that can be much faster and requires fewer resources than using a botnet in a DDoS attack. Because of these features, and the potential and high probability of security exploits on network-enabled embedded devices, this technique has come to the attention of numerous hacking communities. BrickerBot, a piece of malware that targeted IoT devices, used PDoS attacks to disable its targets. PhlashDance is a tool created by Rich Smith (an employee of Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s Systems Security Lab) used to detect and demonstrate PDoS vulnerabilities at the 2008 EUSecWest Applied Security Conference in London, UK.

===Reflected attack===
A distributed denial-of-service attack may involve sending forged requests of some type to a very large number of computers that will reply to the requests. Using Internet Protocol address spoofing, the source address is set to that of the targeted victim, which means all the replies will go to (and flood) the target. This reflected attack form is sometimes called a distributed reflective denial-of-service (DRDoS) attack. ICMP echo request attacks (Smurf attacks) can be considered one form of reflected attack, as the flooding hosts send Echo Requests to the broadcast addresses of mis-configured networks, thereby enticing hosts to send Echo Reply packets to the victim. Some early DDoS programs implemented a distributed form of this attack.

===Amplification===
Amplification attacks are used to magnify the bandwidth that is sent to a victim. Many services can be exploited to act as reflectors, some harder to block than others. US-CERT have observed that different services may result in different amplification factors, as tabulated below:

DNS amplification attacks involves an attacker sending a DNS name lookup request to one or more public DNS servers, spoofing the source IP address of the targeted victim. The attacker tries to request as much information as possible, thus amplifying the DNS response that is sent to the targeted victim. Since the size of the request is significantly smaller than the response, the attacker is easily able to increase the amount of traffic directed at the target.

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and Network Time Protocol (NTP) can also be exploited as reflectors in an amplification attack. An example of an amplified DDoS attack through the NTP is through a command called monlist, which sends the details of the last 600 hosts that have requested the time from the NTP server back to the requester. A small request to this time server can be sent using a spoofed source IP address of some victim, which results in a response 556.9 times the size of the request being sent to the victim. This becomes amplified when using botnets that all send requests with the same spoofed IP source, which will result in a massive amount of data being sent back to the victim. It is very difficult to defend against these types of attacks because the response data is coming from legitimate servers. These attack requests are also sent through UDP, which does not require a connection to the server. This means that the source IP is not verified when a request is received by the server. To bring awareness of these vulnerabilities, campaigns have been started that are dedicated to finding amplification vectors which have led to people fixing their resolvers or having the resolvers shut down completely.

===Mirai botnet===
The Mirai botnet works by using a computer worm to infect hundreds of thousands of IoT devices across the internet. The worm propagates through networks and systems taking control of poorly protected IoT devices such as thermostats, Wi-Fi-enabled clocks, and washing machines. The owner or user will usually have no immediate indication of when the device becomes infected. The IoT device itself is not the direct target of the attack, it is used as a part of a larger attack. Once the hacker has enslaved the desired number of devices, they instruct the devices to try to contact an ISP. In October 2016, a Mirai botnet attacked Dyn which is the ISP for sites such as Twitter, Netflix, etc. As soon as this occurred, these websites were all unreachable for several hours.

===R-U-Dead-Yet? (RUDY)===
RUDY attack targets web applications by starvation of available sessions on the web server. Much like Slowloris, RUDY keeps sessions at halt using never-ending POST transmissions and sending an arbitrarily large content-length header value.

===SACK Panic===
Manipulating maximum segment size and selective acknowledgement (SACK) may be used by a remote peer to cause a denial of service by an integer overflow in the Linux kernel, potentially causing a kernel panic. Jonathan Looney discovered on June 17, 2019.

===Shrew attack===
The shrew attack is a denial-of-service attack on the Transmission Control Protocol where the attacker employs man-in-the-middle techniques. It exploits a weakness in TCP&#x27;s re-transmission timeout mechanism, using short synchronized bursts of traffic to disrupt TCP connections on the same link.

===Slow read attack===
A slow read attack sends legitimate application layer requests, but reads responses very slowly, keeping connections open longer hoping to exhaust the server&#x27;s connection pool. The slow read is achieved by advertising a very small number for the TCP Receive Window size, and at the same time emptying clients&#x27; TCP receive buffer slowly, which causes a very low data flow rate.

===Sophisticated low-bandwidth Distributed Denial-of-Service Attack===
A sophisticated low-bandwidth DDoS attack is a form of DoS that uses less traffic and increases its effectiveness by aiming at a weak point in the victim&#x27;s system design, i.e., the attacker sends traffic consisting of complicated requests to the system. Essentially, a sophisticated DDoS attack is lower in cost due to its use of less traffic, is smaller in size making it more difficult to identify, and it has the ability to hurt systems which are protected by flow control mechanisms.

===SYN flood===
A SYN flood occurs when a host sends a flood of TCP/SYN packets, often with a forged sender address. Each of these packets is handled like a connection request, causing the server to spawn a half-open connection, send back a TCP/SYN-ACK packet, and wait for a packet in response from the sender address. However, because the sender&#x27;s address is forged, the response never comes. These half-open connections exhaust the available connections the server can make, keeping it from responding to legitimate requests until after the attack ends.

===Teardrop attacks===
A teardrop attack involves sending mangled IP fragments with overlapping, oversized payloads to the target machine. This can crash various operating systems because of a bug in their TCP/IP fragmentation re-assembly code. Windows 3.1x, Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems, as well as versions of Linux prior to versions 2.0.32 and 2.1.63 are vulnerable to this attack. One of the fields in an IP header is the &quot;fragment offset&quot; field, indicating the starting position, or offset, of the data contained in a fragmented packet relative to the data in the original packet. If the sum of the offset and size of one fragmented packet differs from that of the next fragmented packet, the packets overlap. When this happens, a server vulnerable to teardrop attacks is unable to reassemble the packets resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

===Telephony denial-of-service===
Voice over IP has made abusive origination of large numbers of telephone voice calls inexpensive and easily automated while permitting call origins to be misrepresented through caller ID spoofing. According to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, telephony denial-of-service (TDoS) has appeared as part of various fraudulent schemes:
* A scammer contacts the victim&#x27;s banker or broker, impersonating the victim to request a funds transfer. The banker&#x27;s attempt to contact the victim for verification of the transfer fails as the victim&#x27;s telephone lines are being flooded with bogus calls, rendering the victim unreachable.
* A scammer contacts consumers with a bogus claim to collect an outstanding payday loan for thousands of dollars. When the consumer objects, the scammer retaliates by flooding the victim&#x27;s employer with automated calls. In some cases, the displayed caller ID is spoofed to impersonate police or law enforcement agencies.
* Swatting: A scammer contacts consumers with a bogus debt collection demand and threatens to send police; when the victim balks, the scammer floods local police numbers with calls on which caller ID is spoofed to display the victim&#x27;s number. Police soon arrive at the victim&#x27;s residence attempting to find the origin of the calls.

TDoS can exist even without Internet telephony. In the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal, telemarketers were used to flood political opponents with spurious calls to jam phone banks on election day. Widespread publication of a number can also flood it with enough calls to render it unusable, as happened by accident in 1981 with multiple +1-area code-867-5309 subscribers inundated by hundreds of calls daily in response to the song &quot;867-5309/Jenny&quot;. TDoS differs from other telephone harassment (such as prank calls and obscene phone calls) by the number of calls originated. By occupying lines continuously with repeated automated calls, the victim is prevented from making or receiving both routine and emergency telephone calls. Related exploits include SMS flooding attacks and black fax or continuous fax transmission by using a loop of paper at the sender.

===TTL expiry attack===
It takes more router resources to drop a packet with a TTL value of 1 or less than it does to forward a packet with a higher TTL value. When a packet is dropped due to TTL expiry, the router CPU must generate and send an ICMP time exceeded response. Generating many of these responses can overload the router&#x27;s CPU.

===UPnP attack===
A UPnP attack uses an existing vulnerability in Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol to get past network security and flood a target&#x27;s network and servers. The attack is based on a DNS amplification technique, but the attack mechanism is a UPnP router that forwards requests from one outer source to another. The UPnP router returns the data on an unexpected UDP port from a bogus IP address, making it harder to take simple action to shut down the traffic flood. According to the Imperva researchers, the most effective way to stop this attack is for companies to lock down UPnP routers.

===SSDP reflection attack===
In 2014, it was discovered that Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) was being used in DDoS attacks known as an SSDP reflection attac&quot;k&quot; &quot;with amplification&quot;. Many devices, including some residential routers, have a vulnerability in the UPnP software that allows an attacker to get replies from UDP port 1900 to a destination address of their choice. With a botnet of thousands of devices, the attackers can generate sufficient packet rates and occupy bandwidth to saturate links, causing the denial of services. Because of this weakness, the network company Cloudflare has described SSDP as the &quot;Stupidly Simple DDoS Protocol&quot;.

===ARP spoofing===
ARP spoofing is a common DoS attack that involves a vulnerability in the ARP protocol that allows an attacker to associate their MAC address to the IP address of another computer or gateway, causing traffic intended for the original authentic IP to be re-routed to that of the attacker, causing a denial of service.

==Defense techniques==

Defensive responses to denial-of-service attacks typically involve the use of a combination of attack detection, traffic classification and response tools, aiming to block traffic the tools identify as illegitimate and allow traffic that they identify as legitimate. A list of response tools include the following.

===Upstream filtering===
All traffic destined to the victim is diverted to pass through a &quot;cleaning center&quot; or a &quot;scrubbing center&quot; via various methods such as: changing the victim IP address in the DNS system, tunneling methods (GRE/VRF, MPLS, SDN), proxies, digital cross connects, or even direct circuits. The cleaning center separates &quot;bad&quot; traffic (DDoS and also other common internet attacks) and only passes good legitimate traffic to the victim server. The victim needs central connectivity to the Internet to use this kind of service unless they happen to be located within the same facility as the cleaning center. DDoS attacks can overwhelm any type of hardware firewall, and passing malicious traffic through large and mature networks becomes more and more effective and economically sustainable against DDoS.

===Application front end hardware===
Application front-end hardware is intelligent hardware placed on the network before traffic reaches the servers. It can be used on networks in conjunction with routers and switches and as part of bandwidth management. Application front-end hardware analyzes data packets as they enter the network, and identifies and drops dangerous or suspicious flows.

===Application level key completion indicators===
Approaches to detection of DDoS attacks against cloud-based applications may be based on an application layer analysis, indicating whether incoming bulk traffic is legitimate. These approaches mainly rely on an identified path of value inside the application and monitor the progress of requests on this path, through markers called &quot;key completion indicators&quot;. In essence, these techniques are statistical methods of assessing the behavior of incoming requests to detect if something unusual or abnormal is going on. An analogy is to a brick-and-mortar department store where customers spend, on average, a known percentage of their time on different activities such as picking up items and examining them, putting them back, filling a basket, waiting to pay, paying, and leaving. If a mob of customers arrived in the store and spent all their time picking up items and putting them back, but never made any purchases, this could be flagged as unusual behavior.

===Blackholing and sinkholing===
With blackhole routing, all the traffic to the attacked DNS or IP address is sent to a &quot;black hole&quot; (null interface or a non-existent server). To be more efficient and avoid affecting network connectivity, it can be managed by the ISP. A DNS sinkhole routes traffic to a valid IP address which analyzes traffic and rejects bad packets. Sinkholing may not be efficient for severe attacks.

===IPS based prevention===
Intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are effective if the attacks have signatures associated with them. However, the trend among attacks is to have legitimate content but bad intent. Intrusion-prevention systems that work on content recognition cannot block behavior-based DoS attacks. An ASIC based IPS may detect and block denial-of-service attacks because they have the processing power and the granularity to analyze the attacks and act like a circuit breaker in an automated way.

===DDS based defense===
More focused on the problem than IPS, a DoS defense system (DDS) can block connection-based DoS attacks and those with legitimate content but bad intent. A DDS can also address both protocol attacks (such as teardrop and ping of death) and rate-based attacks (such as ICMP floods and SYN floods). DDS has a purpose-built system that can easily identify and obstruct denial of service attacks at a greater speed than a software-based system.

===Firewalls===
In the case of a simple attack, a firewall can be adjusted to deny all incoming traffic from the attackers, based on protocols, ports, or the originating IP addresses. More complex attacks will however be hard to block with simple rules: for example, if there is an ongoing attack on port 80 (web service), it is not possible to drop all incoming traffic on this port because doing so will prevent the server from receiving and serving legitimate traffic. Additionally, firewalls may be too deep in the network hierarchy, with routers being adversely affected before the traffic gets to the firewall. Also, many security tools still do not support IPv6 or may not be configured properly, so the firewalls may be bypassed during the attacks.

===Routers===
Similar to switches, routers have some rate-limiting and ACL capabilities. They, too, are manually set. Most routers can be easily overwhelmed under a DoS attack. Nokia SR-OS using FP4 or FP5 processors offers DDoS protection. Nokia SR-OS also uses big data analytics-based Nokia Deepfield Defender for DDoS protection. Cisco IOS has optional features that can reduce the impact of flooding.

===Switches===
Most switches have some rate-limiting and ACL capability. Some switches provide automatic or system-wide rate limiting, traffic shaping, delayed binding (TCP splicing), deep packet inspection and bogon filtering (bogus IP filtering) to detect and remediate DoS attacks through automatic rate filtering and WAN Link failover and balancing. These schemes will work as long as the DoS attacks can be prevented by using them. For example, SYN flood can be prevented using delayed binding or TCP splicing. Similarly, content-based DoS may be prevented using deep packet inspection. Attacks using Martian packets can be prevented using bogon filtering. Automatic rate filtering can work as long as set rate thresholds have been set correctly. WAN-link failover will work as long as both links have a DoS prevention mechanism.

==Blocking vulnerable ports==
Threats may be associated with specific TCP or UDP port numbers. Blocking these ports at the firewall can mitigate an attack. For example, in an SSDP reflection attack, the key mitigation is to block incoming UDP traffic on port 1900.

==Unintentional denial-of-service==
An unintentional denial-of-service can occur when a system ends up denied, not due to a deliberate attack by a single individual or group of individuals, but simply due to a sudden enormous spike in popularity. This can happen when an extremely popular website posts a prominent link to a second, less well-prepared site, for example, as part of a news story. The result is that a significant proportion of the primary site&#x27;s regular userspotentially hundreds of thousands of peopleclick that link in the space of a few hours, having the same effect on the target website as a DDoS attack. A VIPDoS is the same, but specifically when the link was posted by a celebrity. When Michael Jackson died in 2009, websites such as Google and Twitter slowed down or even crashed. Many sites&#x27; servers thought the requests were from a virus or spyware trying to cause a denial-of-service attack, warning users that their queries looked like &quot;automated requests from a computer virus or spyware application&quot;.

News sites and link sitessites whose primary function is to provide links to interesting content elsewhere on the Internetare most likely to cause this phenomenon. The canonical example is the Slashdot effect when receiving traffic from Slashdot. It is also known as &quot;the Reddit hug of death&quot; and &quot;the Digg effect&quot;.

Similar unintentional denial-of-service can also occur via other media, e.g. when a URL is mentioned on television. In March 2014, after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 went missing, DigitalGlobe launched a crowdsourcing service on which users could help search for the missing jet in satellite images. The response overwhelmed the company&#x27;s servers. An unintentional denial-of-service may also result from a prescheduled event created by the website itself, as was the case of the Census in Australia in 2016.

Legal action has been taken in at least one such case. In 2006, Universal Tube &amp; Rollform Equipment Corporation sued YouTube: massive numbers of would-be YouTube.com users accidentally typed the tube company&#x27;s URL, utube.com. As a result, the tube company ended up having to spend large amounts of money on upgrading its bandwidth. The company appears to have taken advantage of the situation, with utube.com now containing ads and receiving advertisement revenue. 

Routers have also been known to create unintentional DoS attacks, as both D-Link and Netgear routers have overloaded NTP servers by flooding them without respecting the restrictions of client types or geographical limitations.

==Side effects of attacks==

===Backscatter===
In computer network security, backscatter is a side-effect of a spoofed denial-of-service attack. In this kind of attack, the attacker spoofs the source address in IP packets sent to the victim. In general, the victim machine cannot distinguish between the spoofed packets and legitimate packets, so the victim responds to the spoofed packets as it normally would. These response packets are known as backscatter.

If the attacker is spoofing source addresses randomly, the backscatter response packets from the victim will be sent back to random destinations. This effect can be used by network telescopes as indirect evidence of such attacks. The term &quot;backscatter analysis&quot; refers to observing backscatter packets arriving at a statistically significant portion of the IP address space to determine the characteristics of DoS attacks and victims.

==Legality==

Many jurisdictions have laws under which denial-of-service attacks are illegal. UNCTAD highlights that 156 countries, or 80% globally, have enacted cybercrime laws to combat its widespread impact. Adoption rates vary by region, with Europe at a 91% rate, and Africa at 72%.

In the US, denial-of-service attacks may be considered a federal crime under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act with penalties that include years of imprisonment. The Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the US Department of Justice handles cases of DoS and DDoS. In one example, in July 2019, Austin Thompson, aka DerpTrolling, was sentenced to 27 months in prison and $95,000 restitution by a federal court for conducting multiple DDoS attacks on major video gaming companies, disrupting their systems from hours to days.

In European countries, committing criminal denial-of-service attacks may, as a minimum, lead to arrest. The United Kingdom is unusual in that it specifically outlawed denial-of-service attacks and set a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison with the Police and Justice Act 2006, which amended Section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act 1990.

In January 2019, Europol announced that &quot;actions are currently underway worldwide to track down the users&quot; of Webstresser.org, a former DDoS marketplace that was shut down in April 2018 as part of Operation PowerOFF. Europol said UK police were conducting a number of &quot;live operations&quot; targeting over 250 users of Webstresser and other DDoS services.

On January 7, 2013, Anonymous posted a petition on the whitehouse.gov site asking that DDoS be recognized as a legal form of protest similar to the Occupy movement, the claim being that the similarity in the purpose of both is same.

<text>In geometry, a simplex (plural: simplexes or simplices) is a generalization of the notion of a triangle or tetrahedron to arbitrary dimensions. The simplex is so-named because it represents the simplest possible polytope in any given dimension. For example,
* a 0-dimensional simplex is a point,
* a 1-dimensional simplex is a line segment,
* a 2-dimensional simplex is a triangle,
* a 3-dimensional simplex is a tetrahedron, and
* a 4-dimensional simplex is a 5-cell.

Specifically, a -simplex is a -dimensional polytope that is the convex hull of its vertices. More formally, suppose the points formula_1 are affinely independent, which means that the vectors formula_2 are linearly independent. Then, the simplex determined by them is the set of points
formula_3

A regular simplex is a simplex that is also a regular polytope. A regular -simplex may be constructed from a regular -simplex by connecting a new vertex to all original vertices by the common edge length.

The standard simplex or probability simplex is the -dimensional simplex whose vertices are the standard unit vectors in formula_4, or in other words
formula_5

In topology and combinatorics, it is common to &quot;glue together&quot; simplices to form a simplicial complex. 

The geometric simplex and simplicial complex should not be confused with the abstract simplicial complex, in which a simplex is simply a finite set and the complex is a family of such sets that is closed under taking subsets.

== History ==
The concept of a simplex was known to William Kingdon Clifford, who wrote about these shapes in 1886 but called them &quot;prime confines&quot;. 
Henri Poincaré, writing about algebraic topology in 1900, called them &quot;generalized tetrahedra&quot;.
In 1902 Pieter Hendrik Schoute described the concept first with the Latin superlative &quot;simplicissimum&quot; (&quot;simplest&quot;) and then with the same Latin adjective in the normal form &quot;simplex&quot; (&quot;simple&quot;).

The regular simplex family is the first of three regular polytope families, labeled by Donald Coxeter as , the other two being the cross-polytope family, labeled as , and the hypercubes, labeled as . A fourth family, the tessellation of -dimensional space by infinitely many hypercubes, he labeled as .

== Elements ==

The convex hull of any nonempty subset of the points that define an -simplex is called a face of the simplex. Faces are simplices themselves. In particular, the convex hull of a subset of size (of the defining points) is an -simplex, called an -face of the -simplex. The 0-faces (i.e., the defining points themselves as sets of size 1) are called the vertices (singular: vertex), the 1-faces are called the edges, the ()-faces are called the facets, and the sole -face is the whole -simplex itself. In general, the number of -faces is equal to the binomial coefficient formula_6. Consequently, the number of -faces of an -simplex may be found in column () of row () of Pascal&#x27;s triangle. A simplex is a coface of a simplex if is a face of . &quot;Face&quot; and &quot;facet&quot; can have different meanings when describing types of simplices in a simplicial complex.

The extended f-vector for an -simplex can be computed by , like the coefficients of polynomial products. For example, a 7-simplex is (1,1)8 = (1,2,1)4 = (1,4,6,4,1)2 = (1,8,28,56,70,56,28,8,1).

The number of 1-faces (edges) of the -simplex is the -th triangle number, the number of 2-faces of the -simplex is the th tetrahedron number, the number of 3-faces of the -simplex is the th 5-cell number, and so on.

An -simplex is the polytope with the fewest vertices that requires dimensions. Consider a line segment &quot;AB&quot; as a shape in a 1-dimensional space (the 1-dimensional space is the line in which the segment lies). One can place a new point somewhere off the line. The new shape, triangle &quot;ABC&quot;, requires two dimensions; it cannot fit in the original 1-dimensional space. The triangle is the 2-simplex, a simple shape that requires two dimensions. Consider a triangle &quot;ABC&quot;, a shape in a 2-dimensional space (the plane in which the triangle resides). One can place a new point somewhere off the plane. The new shape, tetrahedron &quot;ABCD&quot;, requires three dimensions; it cannot fit in the original 2-dimensional space. The tetrahedron is the 3-simplex, a simple shape that requires three dimensions. Consider tetrahedron &quot;ABCD&quot;, a shape in a 3-dimensional space (the 3-space in which the tetrahedron lies). One can place a new point somewhere outside the 3-space. The new shape &quot;ABCDE&quot;, called a 5-cell, requires four dimensions and is called the 4-simplex; it cannot fit in the original 3-dimensional space. (It also cannot be visualized easily.) This idea can be generalized, that is, adding a single new point outside the currently occupied space, which requires going to the next higher dimension to hold the new shape. This idea can also be worked backward: the line segment we started with is a simple shape that requires a 1-dimensional space to hold it; the line segment is the 1-simplex. The line segment itself was formed by starting with a single point in 0-dimensional space (this initial point is the 0-simplex) and adding a second point, which required the increase to 1-dimensional space. 

More formally, an -simplex can be constructed as a join (∨ operator) of an -simplex and a point, . An -simplex can be constructed as a join of an -simplex and an -simplex. The two simplices are oriented to be completely normal from each other, with translation in a direction orthogonal to both of them. A 1-simplex is the join of two points: . A general 2-simplex (scalene triangle) is the join of three points: . An isosceles triangle is the join of a 1-simplex and a point: . An equilateral triangle is 3 ⋅ ( ) or {3}. A general 3-simplex is the join of 4 points: . A 3-simplex with mirror symmetry can be expressed as the join of an edge and two points: . A 3-simplex with triangular symmetry can be expressed as the join of an equilateral triangle and 1 point: or . A regular tetrahedron is or and so on.

In some conventions, the empty set is defined to be a (−1)-simplex. The definition of the simplex above still makes sense if . This convention is more common in applications to algebraic topology (such as simplicial homology) than to the study of polytopes.
== Symmetric graphs of regular simplices ==
These Petrie polygons (skew orthogonal projections) show all the vertices of the regular simplex on a circle, and all vertex pairs connected by edges.
== Standard simplex ==

The standard -simplex (or unit -simplex) is the subset of given by
: formula_7.

The simplex lies in the affine hyperplane obtained by removing the restriction in the above definition.

The vertices of the standard -simplex are the points , where
: 
: .

A &quot;standard simplex&quot; is an example of a 0/1-polytope, with all coordinates as 0 or 1. It can also be seen one facet of a regular -orthoplex.

There is a canonical map from the standard -simplex to an arbitrary -simplex with vertices (, ..., ) given by
: formula_8
The coefficients are called the barycentric coordinates of a point in the -simplex. Such a general simplex is often called an affine -simplex, to emphasize that the canonical map is an affine transformation. It is also sometimes called an oriented affine -simplex to emphasize that the canonical map may be orientation preserving or reversing.

More generally, there is a canonical map from the standard formula_9-simplex (with vertices) onto any polytope with vertices, given by the same equation (modifying indexing):
: formula_10
These are known as generalized barycentric coordinates, and express every polytope as the &quot;image&quot; of a simplex: formula_11

A commonly used function from to the interior of the standard formula_9-simplex is the softmax function, or normalized exponential function; this generalizes the standard logistic function.

=== Examples ===
* Δ0 is the point in .
* Δ1 is the line segment joining and in .
* Δ2 is the equilateral triangle with vertices , and in .
* Δ3 is the regular tetrahedron with vertices , , and in .
* Δ4 is the regular 5-cell with vertices , , , and in .

=== Increasing coordinates ===
An alternative coordinate system is given by taking the indefinite sum:
: formula_13
This yields the alternative presentation by &quot;order,&quot; namely as nondecreasing -tuples between 0 and 1:
: formula_14
Geometrically, this is an -dimensional subset of formula_15 (maximal dimension, codimension 0) rather than of formula_16 (codimension 1). The facets, which on the standard simplex correspond to one coordinate vanishing, formula_17 here correspond to successive coordinates being equal, formula_18 while the interior corresponds to the inequalities becoming &quot;strict&quot; (increasing sequences).

A key distinction between these presentations is the behavior under permuting coordinates – the standard simplex is stabilized by permuting coordinates, while permuting elements of the &quot;ordered simplex&quot; do not leave it invariant, as permuting an ordered sequence generally makes it unordered. Indeed, the ordered simplex is a (closed) fundamental domain for the action of the symmetric group on the -cube, meaning that the orbit of the ordered simplex under the ! elements of the symmetric group divides the -cube into formula_19 mostly disjoint simplices (disjoint except for boundaries), showing that this simplex has volume . Alternatively, the volume can be computed by an iterated integral, whose successive integrands are 1, , , , ..., .

A further property of this presentation is that it uses the order but not addition, and thus can be defined in any dimension over any ordered set, and for example can be used to define an infinite-dimensional simplex without issues of convergence of sums.

=== Projection onto the standard simplex ===
Especially in numerical applications of probability theory a projection onto the standard simplex is of interest. Given formula_20 with possibly negative entries, the closest point formula_21 on the simplex has coordinates 
: formula_22
where formula_23 is chosen such that formula_24

formula_23 can be easily calculated from sorting .
The sorting approach takes formula_26 complexity, which can be improved to complexity via median-finding algorithms. Projecting onto the simplex is computationally similar to projecting onto the formula_27 ball.

=== Corner of cube ===
Finally, a simple variant is to replace &quot;summing to 1&quot; with &quot;summing to at most 1&quot;; this raises the dimension by 1, so to simplify notation, the indexing changes:
: formula_28
This yields an -simplex as a corner of the -cube, and is a standard orthogonal simplex. This is the simplex used in the simplex method, which is based at the origin, and locally models a vertex on a polytope with facets.

== Cartesian coordinates for a regular -dimensional simplex in R&quot;n&quot; ==
One way to write down a regular -simplex in is to choose two points to be the first two vertices, choose a third point to make an equilateral triangle, choose a fourth point to make a regular tetrahedron, and so on. Each step requires satisfying equations that ensure that each newly chosen vertex, together with the previously chosen vertices, forms a regular simplex. There are several sets of equations that can be written down and used for this purpose. These include the equality of all the distances between vertices; the equality of all the distances from vertices to the center of the simplex; the fact that the angle subtended through the new vertex by any two previously chosen vertices is formula_29; and the fact that the angle subtended through the center of the simplex by any two vertices is formula_30.

It is also possible to directly write down a particular regular -simplex in which can then be translated, rotated, and scaled as desired. One way to do this is as follows. Denote the basis vectors of by through . Begin with the standard -simplex which is the convex hull of the basis vectors. By adding an additional vertex, these become a face of a regular -simplex. The additional vertex must lie on the line perpendicular to the barycenter of the standard simplex, so it has the form for some real number . Since the squared distance between two basis vectors is 2, in order for the additional vertex to form a regular -simplex, the squared distance between it and any of the basis vectors must also be 2. This yields a quadratic equation for . Solving this equation shows that there are two choices for the additional vertex:
: formula_31
Either of these, together with the standard basis vectors, yields a regular -simplex.

The above regular -simplex is not centered on the origin. It can be translated to the origin by subtracting the mean of its vertices. By rescaling, it can be given unit side length. This results in the simplex whose vertices are:
: formula_32
for formula_33, and
: formula_34
Note that there are two sets of vertices described here. One set uses formula_35 in each calculation. The other set uses formula_36 in each calculation.

This simplex is inscribed in a hypersphere of radius formula_37.

A different rescaling produces a simplex that is inscribed in a unit hypersphere. When this is done, its vertices are
: formula_38
where formula_33, and
: formula_40
The side length of this simplex is formula_41.

A highly symmetric way to construct a regular -simplex is to use a representation of the cyclic group by orthogonal matrices. This is an orthogonal matrix such that is the identity matrix, but no lower power of is. Applying powers of this matrix to an appropriate vector will produce the vertices of a regular -simplex. To carry this out, first observe that for any orthogonal matrix , there is a choice of basis in which is a block diagonal matrix
: formula_42
where each is orthogonal and either or . In order for to have order , all of these matrices must have order dividing . Therefore each is either a matrix whose only entry is or, if is odd, ; or it is a matrix of the form
: formula_43
where each is an integer between zero and inclusive. A sufficient condition for the orbit of a point to be a regular simplex is that the matrices form a basis for the non-trivial irreducible real representations of , and the vector being rotated is not stabilized by any of them.

In practical terms, for even this means that every matrix is , there is an equality of sets
: formula_44
and, for every , the entries of upon which acts are not both zero. For example, when , one possible matrix is
: formula_45
Applying this to the vector results in the simplex whose vertices are
: formula_46
each of which has distance √5 from the others.
When is odd, the condition means that exactly one of the diagonal blocks is , equal to , and acts upon a non-zero entry of ; while the remaining diagonal blocks, say , are , there is an equality of sets
: formula_47
and each diagonal block acts upon a pair of entries of which are not both zero. So, for example, when , the matrix can be
: formula_48
For the vector , the resulting simplex has vertices
: formula_49
each of which has distance 2 from the others.

== Geometric properties ==

=== Volume ===
The volume of an -simplex in -dimensional space with vertices is
: formula_50

where each column of the determinant is a vector that points from vertex to another vertex . This formula is particularly useful when formula_51 is the origin.

The expression
: formula_52
employs a Gram determinant and works even when the -simplex&#x27;s vertices are in a Euclidean space with more than dimensions, e.g., a triangle in formula_53. 

A more symmetric way to compute the volume of an -simplex in formula_15 is
: formula_55

Another common way of computing the volume of the simplex is via the Cayley–Menger determinant, which works even when the n-simplex&#x27;s vertices are in a Euclidean space with more than n dimensions.

Without the it is the formula for the volume of an -parallelotope. 
This can be understood as follows: Assume that is an -parallelotope constructed on a basis formula_56 of formula_15.
Given a permutation formula_58 of formula_59, call a list of vertices formula_60 a -path if 
: formula_61 
(so there are -paths and formula_62 does not depend on the permutation). The following assertions hold:

If is the unit -hypercube, then the union of the -simplexes formed by the convex hull of each -path is , and these simplexes are congruent and pairwise non-overlapping. In particular, the volume of such a simplex is
: formula_63

If is a general parallelotope, the same assertions hold except that it is no longer true, in dimension &gt; 2, that the simplexes need to be pairwise congruent; yet their volumes remain equal, because the -parallelotope is the image of the unit -hypercube by the linear isomorphism that sends the canonical basis of formula_15 to formula_65. As previously, this implies that the volume of a simplex coming from a -path is:
: formula_66

Conversely, given an -simplex formula_67 of formula_68, it can be supposed that the vectors formula_69 form a basis of formula_68. Considering the parallelotope constructed from formula_51 and formula_65, one sees that the previous formula is valid for every simplex.

Finally, the formula at the beginning of this section is obtained by observing that 
: formula_73

From this formula, it follows immediately that the volume under a standard -simplex (i.e. between the origin and the simplex in ) is
: formula_74

The volume of a regular -simplex with unit side length is
: formula_75
as can be seen by multiplying the previous formula by , to get the volume under the -simplex as a function of its vertex distance from the origin, differentiating with respect to , at formula_76  (where the -simplex side length is 1), and normalizing by the length formula_77 of the increment, formula_78, along the normal vector.

=== Dihedral angles of the regular &quot;n&quot;-simplex ===
Any two -dimensional faces of a regular -dimensional simplex are themselves regular -dimensional simplices, and they have the same dihedral angle of . 

This can be seen by noting that the center of the standard simplex is formula_79, and the centers of its faces are coordinate permutations of formula_80. Then, by symmetry, the vector pointing from formula_79 to formula_80 is perpendicular to the faces. So the vectors normal to the faces are permutations of formula_83, from which the dihedral angles are calculated.

=== Simplices with an &quot;orthogonal corner&quot; ===
An &quot;orthogonal corner&quot; means here that there is a vertex at which all adjacent edges are pairwise orthogonal. It immediately follows that all adjacent faces are pairwise orthogonal. Such simplices are generalizations of right triangles and for them there exists an -dimensional version of the Pythagorean theorem: The sum of the squared -dimensional volumes of the facets adjacent to the orthogonal corner equals the squared -dimensional volume of the facet opposite of the orthogonal corner.
: formula_84
where formula_85 are facets being pairwise orthogonal to each other but not orthogonal to formula_86, which is the facet opposite the orthogonal corner.

For a 2-simplex, the theorem is the Pythagorean theorem for triangles with a right angle and for a 3-simplex it is de Gua&#x27;s theorem for a tetrahedron with an orthogonal corner.

=== Relation to the (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-hypercube ===
The Hasse diagram of the face lattice of an -simplex is isomorphic to the graph of the -hypercube&#x27;s edges, with the hypercube&#x27;s vertices mapping to each of the -simplex&#x27;s elements, including the entire simplex and the null polytope as the extreme points of the lattice (mapped to two opposite vertices on the hypercube). This fact may be used to efficiently enumerate the simplex&#x27;s face lattice, since more general face lattice enumeration algorithms are more computationally expensive.

The -simplex is also the vertex figure of the -hypercube. It is also the facet of the -orthoplex.

=== Topology ===
Topologically, an -simplex is equivalent to an -ball. Every -simplex is an -dimensional manifold with corners.

=== Probability ===
In probability theory, the points of the standard -simplex in -space form the space of possible probability distributions on a finite set consisting of possible outcomes. The correspondence is as follows: For each distribution described as an ordered -tuple of probabilities whose sum is (necessarily) 1, we associate the point of the simplex whose barycentric coordinates are precisely those probabilities. That is, the th vertex of the simplex is assigned to have the th probability of the -tuple as its barycentric coefficient. This correspondence is an affine homeomorphism.

=== Aitchison geometry ===
Aitchinson geometry is a natural way to construct an inner product space from the standard simplex formula_87. It defines the following operations on simplices and real numbers:

; Perturbation (addition)

:: formula_88

; Powering (scalar multiplication)

:: formula_89

; Inner product

:: formula_90

=== Compounds ===
Since all simplices are self-dual, they can form a series of compounds;
* Two triangles form a hexagram {6/2}.
* Two tetrahedra form a compound of two tetrahedra or stella octangula.
* Two 5-cells form a compound of two 5-cells in four dimensions.

== Algebraic topology ==

In algebraic topology, simplices are used as building blocks to construct an interesting class of topological spaces called simplicial complexes. These spaces are built from simplices glued together in a combinatorial fashion. Simplicial complexes are used to define a certain kind of homology called simplicial homology.

A finite set of -simplexes embedded in an open subset of is called an affine -chain. The simplexes in a chain need not be unique; they may occur with multiplicity. Rather than using standard set notation to denote an affine chain, it is instead the standard practice to use plus signs to separate each member in the set. If some of the simplexes have the opposite orientation, these are prefixed by a minus sign. If some of the simplexes occur in the set more than once, these are prefixed with an integer count. Thus, an affine chain takes the symbolic form of a sum with integer coefficients.

Note that each facet of an -simplex is an affine -simplex, and thus the boundary of an -simplex is an affine -chain. Thus, if we denote one positively oriented affine simplex as
: formula_91
with the formula_92 denoting the vertices, then the boundary formula_93 of is the chain
: formula_94

It follows from this expression, and the linearity of the boundary operator, that the boundary of the boundary of a simplex is zero:
: formula_95

Likewise, the boundary of the boundary of a chain is zero: formula_96.

More generally, a simplex (and a chain) can be embedded into a manifold by means of smooth, differentiable map formula_97. In this case, both the summation convention for denoting the set, and the boundary operation commute with the embedding. That is,
: formula_98
where the formula_99 are the integers denoting orientation and multiplicity. For the boundary operator formula_100, one has:
: formula_101
where is a chain. The boundary operation commutes with the mapping because, in the end, the chain is defined as a set and little more, and the set operation always commutes with the map operation (by definition of a map).

A continuous map formula_102 to a topological space is frequently referred to as a singular -simplex. (A map is generally called &quot;singular&quot; if it fails to have some desirable property such as continuity and, in this case, the term is meant to reflect to the fact that the continuous map need not be an embedding.)

== Algebraic geometry ==
Since classical algebraic geometry allows one to talk about polynomial equations but not inequalities, the &quot;algebraic standard n-simplex&quot; is commonly defined as the subset of affine -dimensional space, where all coordinates sum up to 1 (thus leaving out the inequality part). The algebraic description of this set is
formula_103
which equals the scheme-theoretic description formula_104 with
formula_105
the ring of regular functions on the algebraic -simplex (for any ring formula_106).

By using the same definitions as for the classical -simplex, the -simplices for different dimensions assemble into one simplicial object, while the rings formula_107 assemble into one cosimplicial object formula_108 (in the category of schemes resp. rings, since the face and degeneracy maps are all polynomial).

The algebraic -simplices are used in higher &quot;K&quot;-theory and in the definition of higher Chow groups.

== Applications ==
* In statistics, simplices are sample spaces of compositional data and are also used in plotting quantities that sum to 1, such as proportions of subpopulations, as in a ternary plot.
* In probability theory, a simplex space is often used to represent the space of probability distributions. The Dirichlet distribution, for instance, is defined on a simplex.
* In industrial statistics, simplices arise in problem formulation and in algorithmic solution. In the design of bread, the producer must combine yeast, flour, water, sugar, etc. In such mixtures, only the relative proportions of ingredients matters: For an optimal bread mixture, if the flour is doubled then the yeast should be doubled. Such mixture problem are often formulated with normalized constraints, so that the nonnegative components sum to one, in which case the feasible region forms a simplex. The quality of the bread mixtures can be estimated using response surface methodology, and then a local maximum can be computed using a nonlinear programming method, such as sequential quadratic programming.
* In operations research, linear programming problems can be solved by the simplex algorithm of George Dantzig.
* In game theory, strategies can be represented as points within a simplex. This representation simplifies the analysis of mixed strategies.
* In geometric design and computer graphics, many methods first perform simplicial triangulations of the domain and then fit interpolating polynomials to each simplex.
* In chemistry, the hydrides of most elements in the p-block can resemble a simplex if one is to connect each atom. Neon does not react with hydrogen and as such is a point, fluorine bonds with one hydrogen atom and forms a line segment, oxygen bonds with two hydrogen atoms in a bent fashion resembling a triangle, nitrogen reacts to form a tetrahedron, and carbon forms a structure resembling a Schlegel diagram of the 5-cell. This trend continues for the heavier analogues of each element, as well as if the hydrogen atom is replaced by a halogen atom.
* In some approaches to quantum gravity, such as Regge calculus and causal dynamical triangulations, simplices are used as building blocks of discretizations of spacetime; that is, to build simplicial manifolds.

<text>In mathematics, an -sphere or hypersphere is an -dimensional generalization of the -dimensional circle and -dimensional sphere to any non-negative integer .

The circle is considered 1-dimensional, and the sphere 2-dimensional, because the surfaces themselves are 1- and 2-dimensional respectively, &quot;not&quot; because they exist as shapes in 1- and 2-dimensional space. The typical embedding of the 1-dimensional circle is in 2-dimensional space, the 2-dimensional sphere is usually depicted embedded in 3-dimensional space, and a general -sphere is embedded in an -dimensional space. The term &quot;hyper&quot;sphere is commonly used to distinguish spheres of dimension which are thus embedded in a space of dimension , which means that they cannot be easily visualized. The -sphere is the setting for -dimensional spherical geometry.

Considered extrinsically, as a hypersurface embedded in -dimensional Euclidean space, an -sphere is the locus of points at equal distance (the &quot;radius&quot;) from a given &quot;center&quot; point. Its interior, consisting of all points closer to the center than the radius, is an -dimensional ball. In particular:

* The -sphere is the pair of points at the ends of a line segment (-ball).
* The -sphere is a circle, the circumference of a disk (-ball) in the two-dimensional plane.
* The -sphere, often simply called a sphere, is the boundary of a -ball in three-dimensional space.
* The -sphere is the boundary of a -ball in four-dimensional space.
* The -sphere is the boundary of an -ball.

Given a Cartesian coordinate system, the &quot;unit -sphere&quot; of radius can be defined as:

:formula_1

Considered intrinsically, when , the -sphere is a Riemannian manifold of positive constant curvature, and is orientable. The geodesics of the -sphere are called great circles.

The stereographic projection maps the -sphere onto -space with a single adjoined point at infinity; under the metric thereby defined, formula_2 is a model for the -sphere.

In the more general setting of topology, any topological space that is homeomorphic to the unit -sphere is called an -&quot;sphere&quot;. Under inverse stereographic projection, the -sphere is the one-point compactification of -space. The -spheres admit several other topological descriptions: for example, they can be constructed by gluing two -dimensional spaces together, by identifying the boundary of an -cube with a point, or (inductively) by forming the suspension of an -sphere. When it is simply connected; the -sphere (circle) is not simply connected; the -sphere is not even connected, consisting of two discrete points.

==Description==

For any natural number , an -sphere of radius is defined as the set of points in -dimensional Euclidean space that are at distance from some fixed point , where may be any positive real number and where may be any point in -dimensional space. In particular:
* a 0-sphere is a pair of points , and is the boundary of a line segment (-ball).
* a -sphere is a circle of radius centered at , and is the boundary of a disk (-ball).
* a -sphere is an ordinary -dimensional sphere in -dimensional Euclidean space, and is the boundary of an ordinary ball (-ball).
* a -sphere is a -dimensional sphere in -dimensional Euclidean space.

=== Cartesian coordinates ===

The set of points in -space, , that define an -sphere, , is represented by the equation:

:formula_3

where is a center point, and is the radius.

The above -sphere exists in -dimensional Euclidean space and is an example of an -manifold. The volume form of an -sphere of radius is given by

:formula_4

where formula_5 is the Hodge star operator; see for a discussion and proof of this formula in the case . As a result,
:formula_6

=== &quot;n&quot;-ball ===
The space enclosed by an -sphere is called an -ball. An -ball is closed if it includes the -sphere, and it is open if it does not include the -sphere.

Specifically:
* A -&quot;ball&quot;, a line segment, is the interior of a 0-sphere.
* A -&quot;ball&quot;, a disk, is the interior of a circle (-sphere).
* A -&quot;ball&quot;, an ordinary ball, is the interior of a sphere (-sphere).
* A -&quot;ball&quot; is the interior of a -sphere, etc.

===Topological description===
Topologically, an -sphere can be constructed as a one-point compactification of -dimensional Euclidean space. Briefly, the -sphere can be described as , which is -dimensional Euclidean space plus a single point representing infinity in all directions.
In particular, if a single point is removed from an -sphere, it becomes homeomorphic to formula_7. This forms the basis for stereographic projection.

==Volume and area==
Let be the surface area of the unit -sphere of radius embedded in -dimensional Euclidean space, and let be the volume of its interior, the unit -ball. The surface area of an arbitrary -sphere is proportional to the st power of the radius, and the volume of an arbitrary -ball is proportional to the th power of the radius.

The -ball is sometimes defined as a single point. The -dimensional Hausdorff measure is the number of points in a set. So
: formula_8

A unit -ball is a line segment whose points have a single coordinate in the interval of length , and the -sphere consists of its two end-points, with coordinate .
:formula_9

A unit -sphere is the unit circle in the Euclidean plane, and its interior is the unit disk (-ball).
:formula_10

The interior of a 2-sphere in three-dimensional space is the unit -ball.
:formula_11

In general, and are given in closed form by the expressions

:formula_12

where is the gamma function.

As tends to infinity, the volume of the unit -ball (ratio between the volume of an -ball of radius and an -cube of side length ) tends to zero. 

===Recurrences===
The &quot;surface area&quot;, or properly the -dimensional volume, of the -sphere at the boundary of the -ball of radius is related to the volume of the ball by the differential equation
:formula_13

Equivalently, representing the unit -ball as a union of concentric -sphere &quot;shells&quot;,
:formula_14

We can also represent the unit -sphere as a union of products of a circle (-sphere) with an -sphere. Then . Since , the equation
:formula_15
holds for all . Along with the base cases , from above, these recurrences can be used to compute the surface area of any sphere or volume of any ball.

== Spherical coordinates ==
We may define a coordinate system in an -dimensional Euclidean space which is analogous to the spherical coordinate system defined for -dimensional Euclidean space, in which the coordinates consist of a radial coordinate , and angular coordinates , where the angles range over radians (or degrees) and ranges over radians (or degrees). If are the Cartesian coordinates, then we may compute from with:

:formula_16
Except in the special cases described below, the inverse transformation is unique:

:formula_17

where is the two-argument arctangent function.

There are some special cases where the inverse transform is not unique; for any will be ambiguous whenever all of are zero; in this case may be chosen to be zero. (For example, for the -sphere, when the polar angle is or then the point is one of the poles, zenith or nadir, and the choice of azimuthal angle is arbitrary.)

===Spherical volume and area elements===
To express the volume element of -dimensional Euclidean space in terms of spherical coordinates, let and for concision, then observe that the Jacobian matrix of the transformation is:

:formula_18

The determinant of this matrix can be calculated by induction. When , a straightforward computation shows that the determinant is . For larger , observe that can be constructed from as follows. Except in column , rows and of are the same as row of , but multiplied by an extra factor of in row and an extra factor of in row . In column , rows and of are the same as column of row of , but multiplied by extra factors of in row and in row , respectively. The determinant of can be calculated by Laplace expansion in the final column. By the recursive description of , the submatrix formed by deleting the entry at and its row and column almost equals , except that its last row is multiplied by . Similarly, the submatrix formed by deleting the entry at and its row and column almost equals , except that its last row is multiplied by . Therefore the determinant of is
:formula_19
Induction then gives a closed-form expression for the volume element in spherical coordinates
:formula_20
The formula for the volume of the -ball can be derived from this by integration.

Similarly the surface area element of the -sphere of radius , which generalizes the area element of the -sphere, is given by

: formula_21

The natural choice of an orthogonal basis over the angular coordinates is a product of ultraspherical polynomials,

: formula_22

for , and the for the angle in concordance with the spherical harmonics.

=== Polyspherical coordinates ===
The standard spherical coordinate system arises from writing as the product . These two factors may be related using polar coordinates. For each point of formula_7, the standard Cartesian coordinates
:formula_24
can be transformed into a mixed polar–Cartesian coordinate system:
:formula_25
This says that points in may be expressed by taking the ray starting at the origin and passing through formula_26, rotating it towards formula_27 by formula_28, and traveling a distance formula_29 along the ray. Repeating this decomposition eventually leads to the standard spherical coordinate system.

Polyspherical coordinate systems arise from a generalization of this construction. The space is split as the product of two Euclidean spaces of smaller dimension, but neither space is required to be a line. Specifically, suppose that and are positive integers such that . Then . Using this decomposition, a point may be written as
:formula_30
This can be transformed into a mixed polar–Cartesian coordinate system by writing:
:formula_31
Here formula_32 and formula_33 are the unit vectors associated to and . This expresses in terms of , , , and an angle . It can be shown that the domain of is if , if exactly one of and is , and if neither nor are . The inverse transformation is
:formula_34

These splittings may be repeated as long as one of the factors involved has dimension two or greater. A polyspherical coordinate system is the result of repeating these splittings until there are no Cartesian coordinates left. Splittings after the first do not require a radial coordinate because the domains of formula_32 and formula_33 are spheres, so the coordinates of a polyspherical coordinate system are a non-negative radius and angles. The possible polyspherical coordinate systems correspond to binary trees with leaves. Each non-leaf node in the tree corresponds to a splitting and determines an angular coordinate. For instance, the root of the tree represents , and its immediate children represent the first splitting into and . Leaf nodes correspond to Cartesian coordinates for . The formulas for converting from polyspherical coordinates to Cartesian coordinates may be determined by finding the paths from the root to the leaf nodes. These formulas are products with one factor for each branch taken by the path. For a node whose corresponding angular coordinate is , taking the left branch introduces a factor of and taking the right branch introduces a factor of . The inverse transformation, from polyspherical coordinates to Cartesian coordinates, is determined by grouping nodes. Every pair of nodes having a common parent can be converted from a mixed polar–Cartesian coordinate system to a Cartesian coordinate system using the above formulas for a splitting.

Polyspherical coordinates also have an interpretation in terms of the special orthogonal group. A splitting determines a subgroup
:formula_37
This is the subgroup that leaves each of the two factors formula_38 fixed. Choosing a set of coset representatives for the quotient is the same as choosing representative angles for this step of the polyspherical coordinate decomposition.

In polyspherical coordinates, the volume measure on and the area measure on are products. There is one factor for each angle, and the volume measure on also has a factor for the radial coordinate. The area measure has the form:
:formula_39
where the factors are determined by the tree. Similarly, the volume measure is
:formula_40
Suppose we have a node of the tree that corresponds to the decomposition and that has angular coordinate . The corresponding factor depends on the values of and . When the area measure is normalized so that the area of the sphere is , these factors are as follows. If , then
:formula_41
If and , and if denotes the beta function, then
:formula_42
If and , then
:formula_43
Finally, if both and are greater than one, then
:formula_44

== Stereographic projection ==

Just as a two-dimensional sphere embedded in three dimensions can be mapped onto a two-dimensional plane by a stereographic projection, an -sphere can be mapped onto an -dimensional hyperplane by the -dimensional version of the stereographic projection. For example, the point on a two-dimensional sphere of radius maps to the point on the -plane. In other words,
:formula_45

Likewise, the stereographic projection of an -sphere of radius will map to the -dimensional hyperplane perpendicular to the -axis as
:formula_46

== Probability distributions ==

=== Uniformly at random on the -sphere ===
To generate uniformly distributed random points on the unit -sphere (that is, the surface of the unit -ball), gives the following algorithm.

Generate an -dimensional vector of normal deviates (it suffices to use , although in fact the choice of the variance is arbitrary), . Now calculate the &quot;radius&quot; of this point:

:formula_47

The vector is uniformly distributed over the surface of the unit -ball.

An alternative given by Marsaglia is to uniformly randomly select a point in the unit -cube by sampling each independently from the uniform distribution over , computing as above, and rejecting the point and resampling if (i.e., if the point is not in the -ball), and when a point in the ball is obtained scaling it up to the spherical surface by the factor ; then again is uniformly distributed over the surface of the unit -ball. This method becomes very inefficient for higher dimensions, as a vanishingly small fraction of the unit cube is contained in the sphere. In ten dimensions, less than 2% of the cube is filled by the sphere, so that typically more than 50 attempts will be needed. In seventy dimensions, less than formula_48 of the cube is filled, meaning typically a trillion quadrillion trials will be needed, far more than a computer could ever carry out.

=== Uniformly at random within the &quot;n&quot;-ball ===
With a point selected uniformly at random from the surface of the unit -sphere (e.g., by using Marsaglia&#x27;s algorithm), one needs only a radius to obtain a point uniformly at random from within the unit -ball. If is a number generated uniformly at random from the interval and is a point selected uniformly at random from the unit -sphere, then is uniformly distributed within the unit -ball.

Alternatively, points may be sampled uniformly from within the unit -ball by a reduction from the unit -sphere. In particular, if is a point selected uniformly from the unit -sphere, then is uniformly distributed within the unit -ball (i.e., by simply discarding two coordinates).

If is sufficiently large, most of the volume of the -ball will be contained in the region very close to its surface, so a point selected from that volume will also probably be close to the surface. This is one of the phenomena leading to the so-called curse of dimensionality that arises in some numerical and other applications.

=== Distribution of the first coordinate ===
Let be the square of the first coordinate of a point sampled uniformly at random from the -sphere, then its probability density function, for formula_49, is 

formula_50

Let formula_51 be the appropriately scaled version, then at the formula_52 limit, the probability density function of formula_53 converges to formula_54. This is sometimes called the Porter–Thomas distribution.

; -sphere : Topological quasigroup structure as the set of unit octonions. Principal -bundle over . Parallelizable. . The -sphere is of particular interest since it was in this dimension that the first exotic spheres were discovered.
; -sphere : Homeomorphic to the octonionic projective line .
; -sphere : A highly dense sphere-packing is possible in -dimensional space, which is related to the unique qualities of the Leech lattice.

== Octahedral sphere ==
The octahedral -sphere is defined similarly to the -sphere but using the -norm

:formula_55

In general, it takes the shape of a cross-polytope.

The octahedral -sphere is a square (without its interior). The octahedral -sphere is a regular octahedron; hence the name. The octahedral -sphere is the topological join of pairs of isolated points. Intuitively, the topological join of two pairs is generated by drawing a segment between each point in one pair and each point in the other pair; this yields a square. To join this with a third pair, draw a segment between each point on the square and each point in the third pair; this gives a octahedron.

<text>In geometry, a hypercube is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional analogue of a square () and a cube (); the special case for  is known as a &quot;tesseract&quot;. It is a closed, compact, convex figure whose 1-skeleton consists of groups of opposite parallel line segments aligned in each of the space&#x27;s dimensions, perpendicular to each other and of the same length. A unit hypercube&#x27;s longest diagonal in &quot;n&quot; dimensions is equal to formula_1.

An &quot;n&quot;-dimensional hypercube is more commonly referred to as an n&quot;-cubeor sometimes as an n&quot;-dimensional cube. The term measure polytope (originally from Elte, 1912) is also used, notably in the work of H. S. M. Coxeter who also labels the hypercubes the γ polytopes.

The hypercube is the special case of a hyperrectangle (also called an &quot;n-orthotope&quot;).

A &quot;unit hypercube&quot; is a hypercube whose side has length one unit. Often, the hypercube whose corners (or &quot;vertices&quot;) are the 2&quot;n&quot; points in R&quot;n&quot; with each coordinate equal to 0 or 1 is called &quot;the&quot; unit hypercube.

== Construction ==
=== By the number of dimensions ===
A hypercube can be defined by increasing the numbers of dimensions of a shape:
:0 – A point is a hypercube of dimension zero.
:1 – If one moves this point one unit length, it will sweep out a line segment, which is a unit hypercube of dimension one.
:2 – If one moves this line segment its length in a perpendicular direction from itself; it sweeps out a 2-dimensional square.
:3 – If one moves the square one unit length in the direction perpendicular to the plane it lies on, it will generate a 3-dimensional cube.
:4 – If one moves the cube one unit length into the fourth dimension, it generates a 4-dimensional unit hypercube (a unit tesseract).

This can be generalized to any number of dimensions. This process of sweeping out volumes can be formalized mathematically as a Minkowski sum: the &quot;d&quot;-dimensional hypercube is the Minkowski sum of &quot;d&quot; mutually perpendicular unit-length line segments, and is therefore an example of a zonotope.

The 1-skeleton of a hypercube is a hypercube graph.

=== Vertex coordinates ===

A unit hypercube of dimension formula_2 is the convex hull of all the formula_3 points whose formula_2 Cartesian coordinates are each equal to either formula_5 or formula_6. These points are its vertices. The hypercube with these coordinates is also the cartesian product formula_7 of formula_2 copies of the unit interval formula_9. Another unit hypercube, centered at the origin of the ambient space, can be obtained from this one by a translation. It is the convex hull of the formula_3 points whose vectors of Cartesian coordinates are

: formula_11

Here the symbol formula_12 means that each coordinate is either equal to formula_13 or to formula_14. This unit hypercube is also the cartesian product formula_15. Any unit hypercube has an edge length of formula_6 and an formula_2-dimensional volume of formula_6.

The formula_2-dimensional hypercube obtained as the convex hull of the points with coordinates formula_20 or, equivalently as the Cartesian product formula_21 is also often considered due to the simpler form of its vertex coordinates. Its edge length is formula_22, and its formula_2-dimensional volume is formula_3.

== Faces ==
Every hypercube admits, as its faces, hypercubes of a lower dimension contained in its boundary. A hypercube of dimension formula_2 admits formula_26 facets, or faces of dimension formula_27: a (formula_6-dimensional) line segment has formula_22 endpoints; a (formula_22-dimensional) square has formula_31 sides or edges; a formula_32-dimensional cube has formula_33 square faces; a (formula_31-dimensional) tesseract has formula_35 three-dimensional cubes as its facets. The number of vertices of a hypercube of dimension formula_2 is formula_3 (a usual, formula_32-dimensional cube has formula_39 vertices, for instance).

The number of the formula_40-dimensional hypercubes (just referred to as formula_40-cubes from here on) contained in the boundary of an formula_2-cube is

:formula_43,     where formula_44 and formula_45 denotes the factorial of formula_2.

For example, the boundary of a formula_31-cube (formula_48) contains formula_35 cubes (formula_32-cubes), formula_51 squares (formula_22-cubes), formula_53 line segments (formula_6-cubes) and formula_55 vertices (formula_5-cubes). This identity can be proven by a simple combinatorial argument: for each of the formula_3 vertices of the hypercube, there are formula_58 ways to choose a collection of formula_40 edges incident to that vertex. Each of these collections defines one of the formula_40-dimensional faces incident to the considered vertex. Doing this for all the vertices of the hypercube, each of the formula_40-dimensional faces of the hypercube is counted formula_62 times since it has that many vertices, and we need to divide formula_63 by this number.

The number of facets of the hypercube can be used to compute the formula_64-dimensional volume of its boundary: that volume is formula_26 times the volume of a formula_64-dimensional hypercube; that is, formula_67 where formula_68 is the length of the edges of the hypercube.

These numbers can also be generated by the linear recurrence relation.

:formula_69,     with formula_70, and formula_71 when formula_72, formula_73, or formula_74.

For example, extending a square via its 4 vertices adds one extra line segment (edge) per vertex. Adding the opposite square to form a cube provides formula_75 line segments. 

The extended f-vector for an &quot;n&quot;-cube can also be computed by expanding formula_76 (concisely, (2,1)&quot;n&quot;), and reading off the coefficients of the resulting polynomial. For example, the elements of a tesseract is (2,1)4 = (4,4,1)2 = (16,32,24,8,1).

=== Graphs ===
An &quot;n&quot;-cube can be projected inside a regular 2&quot;n&quot;-gonal polygon by a skew orthogonal projection, shown here from the line segment to the 16-cube.

== Related families of polytopes ==
The hypercubes are one of the few families of regular polytopes that are represented in any number of dimensions.

The hypercube (offset) family is one of three regular polytope families, labeled by Coxeter as &quot;γn&quot;. The other two are the hypercube dual family, the cross-polytopes, labeled as &quot;βn,&quot; and the simplices, labeled as &quot;αn&quot;. A fourth family, the infinite tessellations of hypercubes, is labeled as &quot;δn&quot;.

Another related family of semiregular and uniform polytopes is the demihypercubes, which are constructed from hypercubes with alternate vertices deleted and simplex facets added in the gaps, labeled as &quot;hγn&quot;.

&quot;n&quot;-cubes can be combined with their duals (the cross-polytopes) to form compound polytopes:

* In two dimensions, we obtain the octagrammic star figure {8/2},
* In three dimensions we obtain the compound of cube and octahedron,
* In four dimensions we obtain the compound of tesseract and 16-cell.

== Relation to (&quot;n&quot;−1)-simplices ==
The graph of the &quot;n&quot;-hypercube&#x27;s edges is isomorphic to the Hasse diagram of the (&quot;n&quot;−1)-simplex&#x27;s face lattice. This can be seen by orienting the &quot;n&quot;-hypercube so that two opposite vertices lie vertically, corresponding to the (&quot;n&quot;−1)-simplex itself and the null polytope, respectively. Each vertex connected to the top vertex then uniquely maps to one of the (&quot;n&quot;−1)-simplex&#x27;s facets (&quot;n&quot;−2 faces), and each vertex connected to those vertices maps to one of the simplex&#x27;s &quot;n&quot;−3 faces, and so forth, and the vertices connected to the bottom vertex map to the simplex&#x27;s vertices.

This relation may be used to generate the face lattice of an (&quot;n&quot;−1)-simplex efficiently, since face lattice enumeration algorithms applicable to general polytopes are more computationally expensive.

== Generalized hypercubes ==
Regular complex polytopes can be defined in complex Hilbert space called &quot;generalized hypercubes&quot;, γ = &quot;p&quot;{4}2{3}...2{3}2, or ... Real solutions exist with &quot;p&quot; = 2, i.e. γ = γ&quot;n&quot; = 2{4}2{3}...2{3}2 = {4,3..,3}. For &quot;p&quot; &gt; 2, they exist in formula_77. The facets are generalized (&quot;n&quot;−1)-cube and the vertex figure are regular simplexes.

The regular polygon perimeter seen in these orthogonal projections is called a Petrie polygon. The generalized squares (&quot;n&quot; = 2) are shown with edges outlined as red and blue alternating color &quot;p&quot;-edges, while the higher &quot;n&quot;-cubes are drawn with black outlined &quot;p&quot;-edges.

The number of &quot;m&quot;-face elements in a &quot;p&quot;-generalized &quot;n&quot;-cube are: formula_78. This is &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; vertices and &quot;pn&quot; facets.

== Relation to exponentiation ==
Any positive integer raised to another positive integer power will yield a third integer, with this third integer being a specific type of figurate number corresponding to an &quot;n&quot;-cube with a number of dimensions corresponding to the exponential. For example, the exponent 2 will yield a square number or &quot;perfect square&quot;, which can be arranged into a square shape with a side length corresponding to that of the base. Similarly, the exponent 3 will yield a perfect cube, an integer which can be arranged into a cube shape with a side length of the base. As a result, the act of raising a number to 2 or 3 is more commonly referred to as &quot;squaring&quot; and &quot;cubing&quot;, respectively. However, the names of higher-order hypercubes do not appear to be in common use for higher powers.
