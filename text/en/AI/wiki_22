<text>Heinrich Christian Wilhelm Busch (14 April 1832 – 9 January 1908) was a German humorist, poet, illustrator, and painter. He published wildly innovative illustrated tales that remain influential to this day.

Busch drew on the tropes of folk humour as well as a profound knowledge of German literature and art to satirize contemporary life, any kind of piety, Catholicism, Philistinism, religious morality, bigotry, and moral uplift.

His mastery of drawing and verse became deeply influential for future generations of comic artists and vernacular poets. Among many notable influences, &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot; was inspired by Busch&#x27;s &quot;Max and Moritz&quot;. Today, the Wilhelm Busch Prize and the Wilhelm Busch Museum help maintain his legacy. The 175th anniversary of his birth in 2007 was celebrated throughout Germany. Busch remains one of the most influential poets and artists in Western Europe, being called the &quot;Forefather of Comics&quot;.

==Family background==
Johann Georg Kleine, Wilhelm Busch&#x27;s maternal grandfather, settled in the small village of Wiedensahl, where in 1817 he bought a thatched half-timbered house where Wilhelm Busch was to be born 15 years later. Amalie Kleine, Johann&#x27;s wife and Wilhelm Busch&#x27;s grandmother, kept a shop where Busch&#x27;s mother Henriette assisted while her two brothers attended high school. When Johann Georg Kleine died in 1820, his widow continued to run the shop with Henriette.

At the age of 19 Henriette Kleine married surgeon Friedrich Wilhelm Stümpe. Henriette became widowed at the age of 26, with her three children to Stümpe dying as infants. About 1830 Friedrich Wilhelm Busch, the illegitimate son of a farmer, settled in Wiedensahl after completing a business apprenticeship in the nearby village of Loccum. He took over the Kleine shop in Wiedensahl, which he completely modernised. He married Henriette Kleine Stümpe.

==Life==
===Childhood===
Wilhelm Busch was born on 14 April 1832, the first of seven children to Henriette Kleine Stümpe and Friedrich Wilhelm Busch. His six siblings followed shortly after: Fanny (1834), Gustav (1836), Adolf (1838), Otto (1841), Anna (1843), and Hermann (1845); all survived childhood. His parents were ambitious, hard-working and devout Protestants who later, despite becoming relatively prosperous, could not afford to educate all three sons. Busch&#x27;s biographer Berndt W. Wessling suggested that Friedrich Wilhelm Busch invested heavily in the education of his sons partly because his own illegitimacy held significant stigma in rural areas.

The young Wilhelm Busch was a tall child, with a delicate physique. The coarse boyishness of his later protagonists, &quot;Max and Moritz&quot; was not his own. He described himself in autobiographical sketches and letters as sensitive and timid, someone who &quot;carefully studied fear&quot;, and who reacted with fascination, compassion, and distress when animals were killed in the autumn. He described the &quot;transformation to sausage&quot; as &quot;dreadfully compelling&quot;, leaving a lasting impression; pork nauseated him throughout his life.

In the autumn of 1841, after the birth of his brother Otto, Busch&#x27;s education was entrusted to the 35-year-old clergyman, Georg Kleine, his maternal uncle at Ebergötzen, where 100 children were taught within a space of . This probably through lack of space in the Busch family home, and his father&#x27;s desire for a better education than the small local school could provide. The nearest convenient school was located in Bückeburg, from Wiedensahl. Kleine, with his wife Fanny Petri, lived in a rectory at Ebergötzen, while Busch was lodged with an unrelated family. Kleine and his wife were responsible and caring, exercised a substitute parental role, and provided refuge for him in future unsuccessful times.
Kleine&#x27;s private lessons for Busch also were attended by Erich Bachmann, the son of a wealthy Ebergötzen miller. Both became friends, according to Busch the strongest friendship of his childhood. This friendship was echoed in the 1865 story, &quot;Max and Moritz&quot;. A small pencil portrait by the 14-year-old Busch depicted Bachmann as a chubby, confident boy, and showed similarities with Max. Busch portrayed himself with a &quot;cowlick&quot;, in the later &quot;Moritzian&quot; perky style.

Kleine was a philologist, his lessons not held in contemporary language, and it is not known for certain all subjects Busch and his friend were taught. Busch did learn elementary arithmetic from his uncle, although science lessons might have been more comprehensive, as Kleine, like many other clergymen, was a beekeeper, and published essays and textbooks on the subject, – Busch demonstrated his knowledge of bee-keeping in his future stories. Drawing, and German and English poetry, were also taught by Kleine.

Busch had little contact with his natural parents during this period. At the time, the journey between Wiedensahl and Ebergötzen took three days by horse. His father visited Ebergötzen two to three times a year, while his mother stayed in Wiedensahl to look after the other children. The 12-year-old Busch visited his family once; his mother at first did not recognize him. Some Busch biographers think that this early separation from his parents, especially from his mother, resulted in his eccentric bachelorhood. In the autumn of 1846, Busch moved with the Kleines to Lüthorst, where, on 11 April 1847, he was confirmed.

===Study===
In September 1847 Busch began studying mechanical engineering at Hannover Polytechnic. Busch&#x27;s biographers are not in agreement as to why his Hanover education ended; most believe that his father had little appreciation of his son&#x27;s artistic inclination. Biographer Eva Weissweiler suspects that Kleine played a major role, and that other possible causes were Busch&#x27;s friendship with an innkeeper, Brümmer, political debates in Brümmer&#x27;s tavern, and Busch&#x27;s reluctance to believe every word of the Bible and catechism.

Busch studied for nearly four years at Hanover, despite initial difficulties in understanding the subject matter. A few months before graduation he confronted his parents with his aspiration to study at the Düsseldorf Art Academy. According to Bush&#x27;s nephew Hermann Nöldeke, his mother supported this inclination. His father eventually acquiesced and Busch moved to Düsseldorf in June 1851, where, to his disappointment at not being admitted to the advanced class, he entered preparatory classes. Busch&#x27;s parents had his tuition fees paid for one year, so in May 1852 he traveled to Antwerp to continue study at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts under Josephus Laurentius Dyckmans. He led his parents to believe that the academy was less regimented than Düsseldorf, and had the opportunity to study Old Masters. At Antwerp he saw for the first time paintings by Peter Paul Rubens, Adriaen Brouwer, David Teniers, and Frans Hals. The pictures aroused his interest, but made him doubt his own skills. Eventually, in 1853, after suffering heavily from typhus, he abandoned his Antwerp studies and returned penniless to Wiedensahl.

===Munich===
Busch was ravaged by disease, and for five months spent time painting and collecting folk tales, legends, songs, ballads, rhymes, and fragments of regional superstitions. Busch&#x27;s biographer, Joseph Kraus, saw these collections as useful additions to folklore, as Busch noted the narrative background to tales and the idiosyncrasies of storytellers. Busch tried to release the collections, but as a publisher could not be found at the time, they were issued after his death. During the Nazi era Busch was known as an &quot;ethnic seer&quot;.

After Busch had spent six months with his uncle Kleine at Lüthorst, he expressed a desire to continue to study in Munich. This request caused a rift with his father who, however, eventually funded this move; – see for comparison Busch&#x27;s illustrated story of &quot;Painter Klecksel&quot;. Busch&#x27;s expectations of the Munich Academy of Fine Arts were not met. His life became aimless; there were occasional return visits to Lüthorst, but contact with his parents had been broken off. In 1857 and 1858, as his position seemed to be without prospects, he contemplated emigration to Brazil to keep bees.

Busch made contact with the artist association, Jung München (Young Munich), met several notable Munich artists, and wrote and provided cartoons for the Jung München newspaper. Kaspar Braun, who published the satirical newspapers, &quot;Münchener Bilderbogen&quot; (Picture Sheets from Munich) and &quot;Fliegende Blätter&quot; (Flying Leaves), proposed a collaboration with Busch. This association provided Busch with sufficient funds to live. An existing self-caricature suggests that at this time he had an intense relationship with a woman from Ammerland. His courtship with a seventeen-year-old merchant&#x27;s daughter, Anna Richter, whom Busch met through his brother Gustav, ended in 1862. Busch&#x27;s biographer, Diers, suggests that her father probably refused to entrust his daughter to an almost unknown artist without regular income.

In his early Munich years Busch&#x27;s attempts to write libretti, which are almost forgotten today, were unsuccessful. Up to 1863 he worked on two or three major works; the third was composed by Georg Kremplsetzer. Busch&#x27;s &quot;Liebestreu und Grausamkeit&quot;, a romantic opera in three acts, &quot;Hansel und Gretel&quot;, and &quot;Der Vetter auf Besuch&quot;, an opera buffa of sorts, were not particularly successful. There was a dispute between Busch and Kremplsetzer during the staging of &quot;Der Vetter auf Besuch&quot;, leading to the removal of Busch&#x27;s name from the production; the piece was renamed, &quot;Singspiel von Georg Kremplsetzer&quot;. However, German composer Elsa Laura Wolzogen set several of his poems to music.

In 1873 Busch returned several times to Munich, and took part in the intense life of the Munich Art Society as an escape from provincial life. In 1877, in a last attempt to be a serious artist, he took a studio in Munich. He left Munich abruptly in 1881, after he disrupted a variety show and subsequently made a scene through the effects of alcohol. The 1878 nine episode illustrated tale &quot;Eight Sheets in the Wind&quot; describes how humans behave like animals when drunk. Busch&#x27;s biographer Weissweiler felt the story was only superficially funny and harmless, but was a study on addiction and its induced state of delusion.

===Publication of &quot;Max and Moritz&quot;===

Between 1860 and 1863 Busch wrote more than one hundred articles for the &quot;Münchener Bilderbogen&quot; and &quot;Fliegende Blätter&quot;, but he felt his dependence on publisher Kaspar Braun had become constricting. Busch appointed Dresden publisher Heinrich Richter, the son of Saxon painter Ludwig Richter, as his new publisher – Richter&#x27;s press up to that time was producing children&#x27;s books and religious Christian devotional literature. Busch could choose themes, although Richter raised some concerns regarding four suggested illustrated tales that were proposed. However, some were published in the 1864 as &quot;Bilderpossen&quot;, proving a failure. Busch then offered Richter the manuscripts of &quot;Max and Moritz&quot;, waiving any fees. Richter rejected the manuscript as sales prospects seemed poor. Busch&#x27;s former publisher, Braun, purchased the right to &quot;Max and Moritz&quot; for 1,000 gulden, corresponding to approximately double the annual wage of a craftsman.

For Braun the manuscript was fortuitous. Initially the sales of &quot;Max and Moritz&quot; were slow, but sales figures improved after the 1868 second edition. Overall there were 56 editions and more than 430,000 copies sold up to Busch&#x27;s death in 1908. Despite at first being ignored by critics, teachers in the 1870s described &quot;Max and Moritz&quot; as frivolous and an undesirable influence on the moral development of young people.

===Frankfurt===
Increasing economic success allowed Busch to visit Wiedensahl more frequently. Busch had decided to leave Munich, as only few relatives lived there and the artist association was temporarily disbanded. In June 1867 Busch met his brother Otto for the first time, in Frankfurt. Otto was working as a tutor to the family of a wealthy banker and industrialist, Kessler. Busch became friends with Kessler&#x27;s wife, Johanna, a mother of seven and an influential art and music patron of Frankfurt. She regularly opened salons at her villa, frequented by artists, musicians, and philosophers. She believed Busch to be a great painter, a view supported by Anton Burger, a leading painter of the Kronberger Malerkolonie, the Kronberg-based group of painters. While his humorous drawings did not appeal to her, she supported his painting career. At first she established an apartment and studio for Busch in her villa, later providing him with an apartment nearby. Motivated by Kessler&#x27;s support and admiration, and introduction to the cultural life of Frankfurt, the &#x27;Frankfurter Years&#x27; were the most artistically productive for Busch. At this time he and Otto discovered the philosophical works of Arthur Schopenhauer.

Busch did not remain in Frankfurt. Toward the end of the 1860s he alternated between Wiedensahl and Lüthorst, and Wolfenbüttel where his brother Gustav lived. The association with Johanna Kessler lasted five years, and after his return to Wiedensahl in 1872 they communicated by letter. This contact was interrupted between 1877 and 1891, after which it was revived with the help of Kessler&#x27;s daughters.

===Later life===

Biographer Weissweiler does not dismiss the possibility that Busch&#x27;s increasing alcohol dependence hindered self-criticism. He refused invitations to parties, and publisher Otto Bassermann sent him to Wiedensahl to keep his alcohol problem undetected from those around him. Busch was also a heavy smoker, resulting in symptoms of severe nicotine poisoning in 1874. He began to illustrate drunkards more often.

Dutch writer Marie Anderson corresponded with Busch. More than fifty letters were exchanged between January and October 1875 in which they discussed philosophy, religion, and ethics. Although only one Anderson letter survives, Busch&#x27;s letters are in manuscripts. They met in Mainz in October 1875, after which he returned to Bassermann at Heidelberg in a &quot;horrible mood&quot;. According to several people at the time, Busch&#x27;s failure to find a wife was responsible for his conspicuous behaviour. There is no evidence that Busch had a close relationship with any woman after that with Anderson.

Busch lived with his sister Fanny&#x27;s family after her husband Pastor Hermann Nöldeke&#x27;s death in 1879. His nephew Adolf Nöldeke remembers that Busch wanted to move back to Wiedensahl with the family. Busch renovated the house, which Fanny looked after even though Busch was a rich man, and became &quot;father&quot; to his three young nephews. She would, however, have preferred to live in a more urban area for the education of her sons. For Fanny and her three sons, Busch could not replace their former idyllic life. The years around 1880 were psychically and emotionally exhausting for Busch, who was still reliant on alcohol. He would not invite visitors to Wiedensahl; because of this Fanny lost contact with her friends in the village, and whenever she questioned his wishes, Busch became furious. Even his friends Otto Friedrich Bassermann, Franz von Lenbach, Hermann Levi and Wilhelm von Kaulbach were not welcome at the house; he would meet them in Kassel or Hanover.

Busch stopped painting in 1896 and signed over all publication rights to Bassermann Verlag for 50,000 gold marks. Busch, now aged 64, felt old. He needed spectacles for writing and painting, and his hands trembled slightly. In 1898, together with his aging sister Fanny Nöldeke, he accepted Bassermann&#x27;s suggestion to move into a large parsonage in Mechtshausen. Busch read biographies, novels and stories in German, English and French. He organized his works and wrote letters and poems. Most of the poems from the collections &quot;Schein und Sein&quot; and &quot;Zu guter Letzt&quot; were written in 1899. The following years were eventless for Busch.

He developed a sore throat in early January 1908, and his doctor detected a weak heart. During the night of 8–9 January 1908 Busch slept uneasily, taking camphor, and a few drops of morphine as a tranquilizer. Busch died the following morning before his physician, called by Otto Nöldeke, came to assist.

==Work==

During the Frankfurt period Busch published three self-contained illustrated satires. Their anti-clerical themes proved popular during the Kulturkampf. Busch&#x27;s satires typically did not address political questions, but exaggerated churchiness, superstition, and philistine double standards. This exaggeration made at least two of the works historically erroneous. The third illustrated satire, &quot;Father Filucius&quot; (Pater Filucius), described by Busch as an &quot;allegorical mayfly&quot;, has greater historical context.

===&quot;Max and Moritz&quot;===

In German, &quot;Eine Bubengeschichte in sieben Streichen&quot;, &quot;Max and Moritz&quot; is a series of seven illustrated stories concerning the mischievous antics of two boys, who are eventually ground up and fed to ducks.

===&quot;Saint Antonius of Padua&quot; and &quot;Helen Who Couldn&#x27;t Help It&quot;===

In &quot;Saint Antonius of Padua&quot; (Der Heilige Antonius von Padua) Busch challenges Catholic belief. It was released by the publisher Moritz Schauenburg at the time Pope Pius IX proclaimed the dogma of papal infallibility that was harshly criticized by Protestants. The publisher&#x27;s works were heavily scrutinized or censored, and the state&#x27;s attorney in Offenburg charged Schauenberg with &quot;vilification of religion and offending public decency through indecent writings&quot; – a decision which affected Busch. Scenes of Antonius accompanied by a pig being admitted to heaven, and the devil being shown as a half-naked ballet dancer seducing Antonius, were deemed controversial. The district court of Düsseldorf subsequently banned &quot;Saint Antonius&quot;. Schauenburg was acquitted on 27 March 1871 in Offenburg, but in Austria distribution of the satire was prohibited until 1902. Schauenburg refused to publish further Busch satires to avoid future accusations.

Busch&#x27;s following work, &quot;Helen Who Couldn&#x27;t Help It&quot; (Die fromme Helene), was published by Otto Friedrich Bassermann, a friend whom Busch met in Munich. &quot;Helen Who Couldn&#x27;t Help It&quot;, which was soon translated into other European languages, satirizes religious hypocrisy and dubious morality:
&lt;poem&gt;
Ein guter Mensch gibt gerne acht,
Ob auch der andre was Böses macht;
Und strebt durch häufige Belehrung
Nach seiner Beß&#x27;rung und Bekehrung
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
A saintly person likes to labor
For the correction of his neighbor,
And sees, through frequent admonition,
To his improvement through contrition.

Or: A good person likes to pay attention,
if the other has evil intention,
and strives by frequent didactic incursion,
after his improvement and conversion.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Many details from &quot;Helen Who Couldn&#x27;t Help It&quot; criticize the way of life of the Kesslers. Johanna Kessler was married to a much older man and entrusted her children to governesses and tutors, while she played an active role in the social life of Frankfurt.
&lt;poem&gt;
Schweigen will ich vom Theater
Wie von da, des Abends spät,
Schöne Mutter, alter Vater
Arm in Arm nach Hause geht

Zwar man zeuget viele Kinder,
Doch man denket nichts dabei.
Und die Kinder werden Sünder,
Wenn&#x27;s den Eltern einerlei.
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
Then again, the pen would rather
Spare the Stage, whose thrills excite
Handsome mother, honest father,
As they amble home at night

Couples couple and redouble
With a blithe and thoughtless air,
But the children get in trouble
If the parents do not care.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The character of Mr. Schmock – the name based on the Yiddish insult &quot;schmuck&quot; – shows similarities with Johanna Kessler&#x27;s husband, who was uninterested in art and culture.

In the second part of &quot;Helen Who Couldn&#x27;t Help It&quot; Busch attacks Catholic pilgrimages. The childless Helen goes on a pilgrimage, accompanied by her cousin and Catholic priest Franz. The pilgrimage is successful, as later Helen gives birth to twins, who resemble Helen and Franz. Franz is later killed by a jealous valet, Jean, for his interest in female kitchen staff. The now widowed Helen is left with only a rosary, prayer book, and alcohol. Drunk, she falls into a burning oil lamp. Finally, Nolte coins a moral phrase, echoing the philosophy of Schopenhauer:
&lt;poem&gt;
Das Gute — dieser Satz steht fest —
Ist stets das Böse, was man läßt!
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
The good (I am convinced, for one)
Is but the bad, one leaves undone.
&lt;/poem&gt;
&quot;Pater Filucius&quot; (Father Filucius) is the only illustrated satire of this period suggested by the publisher. Also aimed at anti-Catholic taste and buyers, it criticizes the Jesuit Order. Kraus felt it was the weakest of all three anti-clerical works. Some satires refer to contemporary events, such as &quot;Monsieur Jacques à Paris during the Siege of 1870&quot; (Monsieur Jacques à Paris während der Belagerung von 1870). Busch biographer Michaela Diers declares the story &quot;tasteless work, drawing on anti-French emotions and mocking the misery of French people in Paris, which is occupied by Prussian troops&quot;. It depicts an increasingly desperate French citizen who at first eats a mouse during the German siege, then amputates his dog&#x27;s tail to cook it, and finally invents an explosion pill which kills his dog and two fellow citizens. Weissweiler believes that Busch wrote with irony. In &quot;Eginhard and Emma&quot; (1864), a fictional family story that takes place in the Charlemagne era, he criticizes the Holy Roman Empire and calls for a German empire in its place; in &quot;The Birthday or the Particularists&quot; (Der Geburtstag oder die Partikularisten) he satirizes the anti-Prussian sentiments of his Hanover countrymen.

===&quot;Critique of the Heart&quot;===

Busch did not write illustrated tales for a while, but focused on the literary &quot;Kritik des Herzens&quot; (Critique of the Heart), wanting to appear more serious to his readers. Contemporary reception for the collection of 81 poems was mainly poor; it was criticized for its focus on marriage and sexuality. His long-time friend Paul Lindau called it &quot;very serious, heartfelt, charming poems&quot;. Dutch writer Marie Anderson was one of few people who enjoyed his &quot;Kritik des Herzens&quot;, and she even planned to publish it in a Dutch newspaper.

===&quot;Adventures of a Bachelor&quot;===
Notwithstanding the hiatus after moving from Frankfurt, the 1870s were one of Busch&#x27;s most productive decades. In 1874 he produced the short illustrated tale, &quot;Diddle-Boom!&quot; (Dideldum!).

Following in 1875, was the &quot;Knopp Trilogy&quot;, about the life of Tobias Knopp: &quot;Adventures of a Bachelor&quot; (Abenteuer eines Junggesellen), &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Knopp&quot; (Herr und Frau Knopp) (1876), and &quot;Julie&quot; (Julchen) (1877). The antagonists of the trilogy are not pairs of nuisances as with &quot;Max and Moritz&quot; or &quot;Jack Crook, Bird of Evil&quot; (Hans Huckebein, der Unglücksrabe). Without pathos, Busch makes Knopp become aware of his mortality:

&lt;poem&gt;
Rosen, Tanten, Basen, Nelken
Sind genötigt zu verwelken;
Ach — und endlich auch durch mich
Macht man einen dicken Strich.
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
April, cousins, maidens, May
Irretrievably decay;
And I also, soon enough,
Shall be cancelled and crossed off.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In the first part of the trilogy, Knopp is depressed and will look for a wife. He visits his old friends and their wives, whom he finds in unenviable relationships. Still not convinced that the life of a bachelor is one for him, he returns home, and without further ado proposes to his housekeeper. The following marriage proposal is, according to Busch biographer Joseph Kraus, one of the shortest in the history of German literature:
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Mädchen&quot;, spricht er, &quot;sag mir ob...&quot;
Und sie lächelt: &quot;Ja, Herr Knopp!&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Wench,&quot; he stammers, &quot;if I were...&quot;
And she smiles: &quot;With pleasure, Sir!&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

According to Wessling, Busch became skeptical of marriage after writing the story. To Marie Anderson he wrote: &quot;I will never marry(...) I am already in good hands with my sister&quot;.

===Last works===
Among Busch&#x27;s last works were the stories, &quot;Clement Dove, the Poet Thwarted&quot; (Balduin Bählamm, der verhinderte Dichter) (1883) and &quot;Painter Squirtle&quot; (Maler Klecksel) (1884), both of which focus on artistic failure, and indirectly his own failure. Both stories begin with a preface, which, for biographer Joseph Kraus, were bravura pieces of &quot;Komische Lyrik&quot; — German comic poetry. &quot;Clement Dove&quot; ridicules the bourgeois amateur poet circle of Munich, &quot;The Crocodiles&quot; (Die Krokodile), and their prominent members Emanuel Geibel, Paul von Heyse, and Adolf Wilbrandt. &quot;Painter Squirtle&quot; criticizes the bourgeois art connoisseur who believes the worth of art is gauged by its price.

&lt;poem&gt;
Mit scharfen Blick nach Kennerweise
Seh ich zunächst mal nach dem Preise,
Und bei genauerer Betrachtung
Steigt mit dem Preise auch die Achtung.
Ich blicke durch die hohle Hand,
Ich blinzle, nicke: &quot;Ah, scharmant!&quot;
Das Kolorit, die Pinselführung,
Die Farbentöne, die Gruppierung,
Dies Lüster, diese Harmonie,
Ein Meisterwerk der Phantasie.
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
For just a minute comment lags,
While secretly I note the tags.
(I emulate the trade&#x27;s elect:
High price engenders high respect.)
I form a spyglass with my hand,
I squint, I nod, I back-step: &quot;Grand!&quot;
What feeling, both naive and deep!
What broad authoritative sweep!
The thrill transmitted as one traces
That lattice-work of patterned spaces!
Those economical designs
Of trailing asymptotic lines!
&lt;/poem&gt;

The prose play &quot;Edwards Dream&quot; (Eduards Traum) was released in 1891, composed of several small grouped episodes, rather than one linear storyline. The work received mixed reception. Joseph Kraus felt it was the peak of the life works by Busch, his nephews called it a masterwork of world literature, and the publisher of a critical collective edition spoke of a narrative style that is not found in contemporary literature. Eva Weissweiler saw in the play Busch&#x27;s attempt to prove himself in the novella genre, believing that everything that angered or insulted him, and his accompanying emotional depths, are apparent in the story. The 1895 story &quot;The Butterfly&quot; (Der Schmetterling) parodies themes and motifs and ridicules the religious optimism of a German romanticism that contradicted Busch&#x27;s realistic anthropology influenced by Schopenhauer and Charles Darwin. Its prose is more stringent in narrative style when compared to &quot;Edwards Dream&quot;. Both were not popular amongst readers, because of their unfamiliar style.

===Painting===

Busch felt his painting skills could not compete with those of the Dutch masters. He regarded few of his paintings as finished, often stacking them one on top of the other in damp corners of his studio, where they stuck together. If the pile of paintings became too high, he burnt some in his garden. Since only a few remaining paintings are dated, categorizing them is difficult. His doubts regarding his skills are expressed in his choice of materials. His ground was usually chosen carelessly. Sometimes he used uneven cardboard or poorly-prepared spruce-wood boards. One exception is a portrait of Johanna Kessler, on a canvas support measuring by , one of his largest paintings. Most of his works, even landscapes, are small. As Busch used poor grounds and colours, most are heavily darkened and have an almost monochrome effect.

Many pictures depict the countryside at Wiedensahl and Lüthorst. They include pollarded willows, cottages in cornfields, cowherds, autumn landscapes, and meadows with streams. A particular feature is the use of red jackets, found in about 280 of 1000 Busch paintings and drawings. The muted or bright red coats are worn usually by a small figure, depicted from behind. The paintings generally represent typical villages. Portraits of the Kesslers, and a series of other portraits depicting Lina Weissenborn in the mid-1870s, are exceptions. A painting of a 10-year-old girl from a Jewish family at Lüthorst portrays her as serious, and having dark, oriental features.

The influence of Dutch painters is clearly visible in Busch&#x27;s work. &quot;Hals diluted and shortened(...) but still Halsian&quot;, wrote Paul Klee after visiting a Busch memorial exhibition in 1908. A strong influence on Busch was Adriaen Brouwer, whose themes were farming and inn life, rustic dances, card players, smokers, drunkards, and rowdies. He dismissed the techniques of Impressionism with its strong preoccupation with the effect of light, and used new colours, such as Aniline Yellow, and photographs, as an aid. The landscapes from the mid-1880s show the same broad brushstrokes as seen in the paintings of the young Franz von Lenbach. Busch refused to exhibit work even though he was befriended by many artists of the Munich School, which would have allowed him to do so; it was not until near the end of his life that he presented his paintings to the public.

==Themes, technique, and style==

Busch biographer Joseph Kraus divided his work into three periods. He points out, however, that this classification is a simplification, as some works by their nature may be of a later or earlier period. All three periods show Busch&#x27;s obsession with German middle class life. His peasants are devoid of sensitivity and village life is marked by a vivid lack of sentiment.

From 1858 to 1865 Busch chiefly worked for the &quot;Fliegenden Blätter&quot; and the &quot;Münchener Bilderbogen&quot;.

The period from 1866 to 1884 is characterized by his major illustrated stories, such as &quot;Helen Who Couldn&#x27;t Help It&quot;. These stories are different in theme from works of his earlier period. The life of his characters start well, but disintegrate, as in &quot;Painter Squirtle&quot; (Maler Klecksel); someone sensitive who becomes a pedant. Others concern recalcitrant children or animals, or make the great or significant foolish and ridiculous. The early stories follow the pattern of children&#x27;s books of orthodox education, such as those by Heinrich Hoffmann&#x27;s &quot;Struwwelpeter&quot;, that aim to teach the devastating consequences of bad behaviour. Busch did not assign value to his work, as he once explained to Heinrich Richter: &quot;I look at my things for what they are, as Nuremberg trinkets [toys], as Schnurr Pfeiferen [worthless and useless things] whose value is to be found not in its artistic content, but in public demand (...)&quot;.

From 1885 until his death in 1908 his work was dominated by prose and poems. The 1895 prose text &quot;Der Schmetterling&quot; contains autobiographical accounts. Peter&#x27;s enchantment by the witch Lucinde, of whom he regards himself a slave, is possibly in reference to Johanna Kessler. Peter, like Busch, returns to his birthplace. It is similar in style to the romantic travel story that Ludwig Tieck established with his 1798 &quot;Franz Sternbalds Wanderungen&quot;. Busch plays with its traditional forms, motifs, pictures, literary topics, and form of narration.

===Technique===
Publisher Kaspar Braun, who commissioned Busch&#x27;s first illustrations, had established the first workshop in Germany to use wood engraving. This letterpress printing technique was developed by English graphic artist Thomas Bewick near the end of the eighteenth century and became the most widely used reproduction system for illustrations over the years. Busch insisted on first making the drawings, afterward writing the verse. Surviving preparatory drawings show line notes, ideas, and movement, and physiognomy studies.

Then the draft was transferred by pencil on white-primed panels of hardwood end grain. Not only was it hard work, but the quality of the printing block was crucial. Everything left white on the block, around Busch&#x27;s drawn lines, was cut from the plate by skilled engravers. Wood engraving allows a finer differentiation than woodcut and the potential tonal values are of almost the quality of intaglio printing, such as copper engraving. Sometimes the result was not satisfactory, leading Busch to rework or reproduce plates. The wood engraving technique did not allow for fine lines, which is why Busch&#x27;s drawing, especially in his illustrated tales up to the mid-1870s, are boldly drawn, giving his work its particular characteristic.

From the mid-1870s Busch&#x27;s illustrations were printed using zincography. With this technique there was no longer any danger that a wood engraver could change the character of his drawings. The originals were photographed and transferred onto a photosensitive zinc plate. This process allowed for the application of a clear, free pen-drawn ink line, and was a much faster printing method. Busch&#x27;s use of zincography began with &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Knopp&quot;.

===Language===
The effect of Busch&#x27;s illustrations is enhanced by his forthright verse, with taunts, derision, ironic twists, exaggeration, ambiguity, and startling rhymes. His language had an influence on the humorous poetry of Erich Kästner, Kurt Tucholsky, Joachim Ringelnatz, and Christian Morgenstern. The contrast in his later work between comic illustration and its seemingly serious accompanying text – already demonstrated in his earlier &quot;Max and Moritz&quot; – is shown in Widow Bolte&#x27;s mawkish dignity, which is disproportionate to the loss of her chickens:
&lt;poem&gt;
Fließet aus dem Aug&#x27;, ihr Tränen!
All mein Hoffen, all mein Sehnen,
Meines Lebens schönster Traum
Hängt an diesem Apfelbaum!&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
Flow, my tears, then, scoring, burning,
All my comfort, hope, and yearning,
All I dreamt might come to be
Dangles from this apple tree!&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;
Many of Busch&#x27;s couplets, part of contemporary common usage, give the impression of weighty wisdom, but in his hands become only apparent truths, hypocrisy, or platitudes. His use of onomatopoeia is a characteristic of his work: &quot;Allez-oop-da&quot; — Max and Moritz steal fried chickens with a fishing rod down a chimney — &quot;reeker-rawker&quot;; &quot;at the plank from bank to bank&quot;; &quot;rickle-rackle&quot;, &quot;hear the millstones grind and crackle&quot;; and &quot;tinkly-clinket&quot; as Eric the cat rips a chandelier from a ceiling in &quot;Helen Who Couldn&#x27;t Help It&quot;. Busch uses names he gives characters to describe their personality. &quot;Studiosus Döppe&quot; (Young Bumbel) has little mental ability; &quot;Sauerbrots&quot; (Sourdough) would not be of a cheerful disposition; and &quot;Förster Knarrtje&quot; (Forester Knarrtje) could hardly be a socialite.

Many of his picture stories use verses with trochee structure:
&lt;poem&gt;
Master Lampel&#x27;s gentle powers
Failed with rascals such as ours
&lt;/poem&gt;
The overweighting of the stressed syllables strengthens the humour of the lines. Busch also uses dactyls, where one accented syllable is followed by two unaccented syllables, as in his &quot;Plisch und Plum&quot;, where they underline the pedantic and solemn words with which teacher Bokelmann educates his pupils. They create tension in the Sourdough chapter from &quot;Adventures of a Bachelor&quot;, through the alternation of trochees and dactyls. Busch often synchronizes format and content in his poems, as in &quot;Fips the Monkey&quot;, where he uses the epic hexameter in a speech about wisdom.

In both his illustrations and poems Busch uses familiar fables, occasionally appropriating their morality and stories, spinning them to illustrate a very different and comic &quot;truth&quot;, and bringing to bear his pessimistic view of the world and human condition. While traditional fables follow the typical philosophy of differentiating between good and evil behaviour, Busch combines both.

===Canings and other cruelties===

It is not unusual to see thrashing, tormenting, and caning in Busch&#x27;s works. Sharp pencils pierced through models, housewives fall onto kitchen knives, thieves are spiked by umbrellas, tailors cut their tormentors with scissors, rascals are ground in corn mills, drunkards burn, and cats, dogs, and monkeys defecate while being tormented. Frequently Busch has been called a sadist by educators and psychologists. Tails that are burnt, pulled off, trapped, stretched, or eaten is seen by Weissweiler as not aggression against animals, but a phallic allusion to Busch&#x27;s undeveloped sexual life. Such graphic text and imagery in cartoon form was not unusual at the time, and publishers, the public, or censors found it not particularly noteworthy. Topics and motifs for his early work were derived from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century popular literature, the gruesome endings of which he often softened.

Caning, a common aspect of nineteenth-century teaching, is prevalent in many of his works, for example Meister Druff in &quot;Adventures of a Bachelor&quot; and Lehrer Bokelmann in &quot;Plish and Plum&quot;, where it is shown as an almost sexual pleasure in applying punishment. Beatings and humiliation are found in his later work too; biographer Gudrun Schury described this as Busch&#x27;s life-motif. 

In the estate of Busch there is the note, &quot;Durch die Kinderjahre hindurchgeprügelt&quot; (Beaten through the childhood years), however there is no evidence that Busch was referring to himself. He couldn&#x27;t recall any beating from his father. His uncle Kleine beat him once, not with the conventional rattan stick, but symbolically with dried dahlia stalks, this for stuffing cow hairs into a village idiot&#x27;s pipe. Weissweiler observes that Busch probably saw canings at his village school, where he went for three years, and quite possibly he also received this punishment. In &quot;Abenteuer eines Junggesellen&quot; Busch illustrates a form of nonviolent progressive education that fails in one scene, and caning in the following scene; the canings that ensued indicate Busch&#x27;s pessimistic picture of life, which has its roots in the Protestant ethic of the nineteenth century, in which he believed that humans are inherently evil and will never master their vices. Civilisation is the aim of education, but it can only mask human instincts superficially. Gentleness only leads to a continuation of human misdeeds, therefore punishment is required, even if one retains an unrepentant character, becomes a trained puppet, or in extreme cases, dies.

===Antisemitism===

The Panic of 1873 led to growing criticism of high finance and the spread of radical Antisemitism, which in the 1880s became a broad undercurrent. These criticisms saw a separation of capital into what was construed as &quot;raffendes&quot; (speculative capital), and what constituted &quot;constructive&quot; creative (&quot;schaffendes&quot;) production capital. The &quot;good&quot;, &quot;native&quot;, and &quot;German&quot; manufacturer was praised by Antisemitic agitators, such as Theodor Fritsch, who opposed what he saw as &quot;&#x27;rapacious&#x27; &#x27;greedy&#x27;, &#x27;blood-sucking&#x27;, &#x27;Jewish&#x27; financial capitalism in the form of &#x27;plutocrats&#x27; and &#x27;usurers&#x27;&quot;. Busch was thought to have embraced those stereotypes. Two passages are often underlined, one in &quot;Helen Who Couldn&#x27;t Help It&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;
Und der Jud mit krummer Ferse,
Krummer Nas&#x27; und krummer Hos&#x27;
Schlängelt sich zur hohen Börse
Tiefverderbt und seelenlos.
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
And the Hebrew, sly and craven,
Round of shoulder, nose, and knee,
Slinks to the Exchange, unshaven
And intent on usury
&lt;/poem&gt;
Robert Gernhardt defended Busch by stating that Jews are satirized only in three passages, of which the oldest is an illustration of a text by another author, published in 1860. He stated that Busch&#x27;s Jewish figures are merely stereotypical, one of a number of stereotypes, such as the &quot;limited Bavarian farmer&quot; and the &quot;Prussian tourist&quot;. Joseph Kraus shares the same view, and uses a couplet from &quot;Eight Sheets in the Wind&quot; (Die Haarbeutel), in which profit-seeking people are:
&lt;poem&gt;
Vornehmlich Juden, Weiber, Christen,
Die dich ganz schrecklich überlisten.
[Mainly Jews, women, Christians / Who outwit you terribly]
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
Most often wenches, Christians, Jews,
Who would much sooner see you lose
&lt;/poem&gt;

Although Gernhardt felt that Jews for Busch were alien, the Jewish conductor Hermann Levi befriended him, suggesting that Busch had a slight bias towards Jews.

==Biographies==
The first biography on Busch, &quot;Über Wilhelm Busch und seine Bedeutung&quot; (About Wilhelm Busch and His Importance), was released in 1886. The painter Eduard Daelen, also a writer, echoed Busch&#x27;s anti-Catholic bias, putting him on equal footing with Leonardo da Vinci, Peter Paul Rubens, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and uncritically quoting correspondences. Even Busch and his friends were embarrassed. Literary scholar Friedrich Theodor Vischer attacked Daelen&#x27;s biography and called him the &quot;envious eunuch of the desiccated Philistine&quot;. After reading this biography Johannes Proelß posted an essay in the Frankfurter Zeitung, which contained many biographical falsehoods – as a response to this, Busch wrote two articles in the same newspaper. Published in October and December 1886, the autobiographical essay &quot;Regarding Myself&quot; (Was mich betrifft) includes basic facts, and some description of his troubles; analysts see within the essay a deep identity crisis. Busch revised his autobiography over the following years. The last such essay was published under the title, &quot;From Me About Me&quot; (Von mir über mich), which includes fewer biographical details and less reflection on bitterness and amusement than &quot;Regarding Myself&quot;.

==Legacy==
Busch celebrated his 70th birthday at his nephew&#x27;s house in Hattorf am Harz. More than 1,000 congratulatory messages were sent to Mechtshausen from around the world. Wilhelm II praised the poet and artist, whose &quot;exquisite works are full of genuine humour and are everlasting for the German people&quot;. The Austrian Alldeutsche Vereinigung (Pan-German Association) repealed the ban on &quot;Der heilige Antonius von Padua&quot;. Verlag Braun &amp; Schneider, who owned the rights of &quot;Max and Moritz&quot;, gave Busch (around €200,000 or $270,000), which was donated to two hospitals in Hanover.

Since then, on the anniversary dates of his birth and death, he has been celebrated frequently. During the 175th anniversary in 2007, there were numerous re-publications of Busch works. Deutsche Post issued stamps depicting the Busch character Hans Huckebein – itself the inspiration for the nickname of the never-built Focke-Wulf Ta 183 German jet fighter design of 1945 – and the German Republic minted a 10 Euro silver coin faced with his portrait. Hanover declared 2007 the &quot;Wilhelm Busch Year&quot;, with images featuring Busch works erected within the city centre.

The Wilhelm Busch Prize is awarded annually for satirical and humorous poetry. The Wilhelm Busch Society, active since 1930, aims to &quot;(...) collect, scientifically revise, and promote Wilhelm Busch&#x27;s works with the public&quot;. It supports the development of caricature and satirical artwork as a recognized branch of the visual arts. It is an advocate of the Wilhelm Busch Museum. Memorials are located in places he lived, including Wiedensahl, Ebergötzen, Lüthorst, Mechtshausen, and Hattorf am Harz.

===Influence on comics===
Andreas C. Knigge described Busch as the &quot;first virtuoso&quot; of illustrated stories. From the second half of the twentieth century he was considered the &quot;Forefather of Comics&quot;. His early illustrations differ from those of the colleagues of Kaspar Braun. They show an increasing focus on protagonists, are less detailed in drawing and atmosphere, and develop from a dramatic understanding of the whole story. All Busch&#x27;s illustrated tales have a plot that firstly describes the circumstance, then a resulting conflict, then solution. Plots are developed through consecutive scenes, similar to film storyboards. Busch conveys an impression of movement and action, at times strengthened through a change of perspective. According to Gert Ueding, his depiction of movement is unique.

One of Busch&#x27;s notable stories is &quot;Der Virtuos&quot; (1865), which describes the life of a pianist who plays privately for an excited listener. Satirizing the self-publicizing artist&#x27;s attitude and his overblown adoration, it varies from Busch&#x27;s other stories as each scene does not contain prose, but is defined with music terminology, such as &quot;Introduzione&quot;, &quot;Maestoso&quot;, and &quot;Fortissimo vivacissimo&quot;. As the scenes increase in tempo, each part of his body and lappet run around. The penultimate scene again depicts the pianist&#x27;s movements, with score sheets floating above the grand piano on which musical notes are dancing. Over the years graphic artists have been fascinated by &quot;Der Virtuos&quot;. August Macke, in a letter to gallery owner Herwarth Walden, described Busch as the first Futurist, stating how well he captured time and movement. Similar pioneering scenes are in &quot;Bilder zur Jobsiade&quot; (1872). Job fails to answer rather easy questions set by twelve clergy, who shake their heads in synchronicity. Each scene is a movement study that presages Eadweard Muybridge&#x27;s photography. Muybridge began his work in 1872, not released until 1893.

===&quot;Moritzian&quot; influence===

Busch&#x27;s greatest success, both within Germany and internationally, was with &quot;Max and Moritz&quot;: Up to the time of his death it was translated into English, Danish, Hebrew, Japanese, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Hungarian, Swedish, and Walloonian. Several countries banned the story – about 1929 the Styrian school board prohibited sales of &quot;Max and Moritz&quot; to teens under eighteen. By 1997 more than 281 dialect and language translations had been produced.

Some early &quot;Moritzian&quot; comic strips were heavily influenced by Busch in plot and narrative style. &quot;Tootle and Bootle&quot; (1896), borrowed so much content from &quot;Max and Moritz&quot; that it was described as a pirate edition. The true &quot;Moritzian&quot; recreation is &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot; by German artist Rudolph Dirks, published in the &quot;New York Journal&quot; from 1897. It was published though William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s suggestion that a pair of siblings following the pattern of &quot;Max and Moritz&quot; should be created. &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot; is regarded as one of the oldest, continuous comic strips.

German &quot;Moritzian&quot;-inspired stories include &quot;Lies und Lene; die Schwestern von Max und Moritz&quot; (Hulda Levetzow, F. Maddalena, 1896), &quot;Schlumperfritz und Schlamperfranz&quot; (1922), &quot;Sigismund und Waldemar, des Max und Moritz Zwillingspaar&quot; (Walther Günther, 1932), and &quot;Mac und Mufti&quot; (Thomas Ahlers, Volker Dehs, 1987). These are shaped by observations of the First and Second World Wars, while the original is a moral story. In 1958 the Christian Democratic Union used the &quot;Max and Moritz&quot; characters for a campaign in North Rhine-Westphalia, the same year that the East German satirical magazine &quot;Eulenspiegel&quot; used them to caricature black labour. In 1969 &quot;Max and Moritz&quot; &quot;participated&quot; in late 1960s student activism.

<text>The Quirinal Hill (; ; ) is one of the Seven Hills of Rome, at the north-east of the city center. It is the location of the official residence of the Italian head of state, who resides in the Quirinal Palace; by metonymy &quot;the Quirinal&quot; has come to stand for the Italian president. The Quirinal Palace has an extension of .

== History ==
According to Roman legend, the Quirinal Hill was the site of a small village of the Sabines, and king Titus Tatius would have lived there after the peace between Romans and Sabines. These Sabines had erected altars in the honour of their god Quirinus (naming the hill by this god).

Tombs from the 8th century BC to the 7th century BC that confirm a likely presence of a Sabine settlement area have been discovered; on the hill, there was the tomb of Quirinus, which Lucius Papirius Cursor transformed into a temple for his triumph after the third Samnite war. Some authors consider it possible that the cult of the Capitoline Triad (Jove, Minerva, Juno) could have been celebrated here well before it became associated with the Capitoline Hill. The sanctuary of Flora, an Osco-Sabine goddess, was here too.

According to Livy, the hill first became part of the city of Rome, along with the Viminal Hill, during the reign of Servius Tullius, Rome&#x27; sixth king, in the 6th century BC.

In 446 BC, a temple was dedicated on the Quirinal in honour of Sancus, and it is possible that this temple was erected over the ruins of another temple. Augustus, too, ordered the building of a temple, dedicated to Mars. On a slope of the Quirinal were the extensive gardens of Sallust.

On the Quirinal Hill Constantine the Great ordered the erection of his baths, the last &quot;thermae&quot; complex erected in imperial Rome. These are now lost, having been incorporated into Renaissance Rome, with only some drawings from the 16th century remaining.

In the Middle Ages, the Torre delle Milizie and the convent of St. Peter and Domenic were built, and above Constantine&#x27;s building was erected the Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi; the two famous colossal marble statues of the Horse Tamers, generally identified as the Dioscuri with horses, which now are in the Piazza Quirinale, were originally in this palazzo. They gave to the Quirinal its medieval name Monte Cavallo, which lingered into the 19th century, when the hill was transformed beyond all recognition by urbanization of an expanding capital of a united Italy. In the same palazzo were also the two statues of river gods that Michelangelo moved to the steps of Palazzo Senatorio on the Capitoline Hill.

According to the political division of the center of Rome, the Hill belongs to the rione Trevi.

== Quirinal Palace ==

The Quirinal Hill is today identified with the Quirinal Palace, the official residence of the President of the Italian Republic in Rome, and one of the symbols of the State. Before the abolition of the Italian monarchy in 1946, it was the residence of the king of Italy, and before 1871 it was, as originally, a residence of the Pope.

The healthy cool air of the Quirinal Hill attracted aristocrats and papal families that built villas where the gardens of Sallust had been in antiquity. A visit to the villa of Cardinal Luigi d&#x27;Este in 1573 convinced Pope Gregory XIII to start the building of a summer residence the following year, in an area considered healthier than the Vatican Hill or Lateran: His architects were Flaminio Ponzio and Ottaviano Nonni, called Mascherino; under Pope Sixtus V, works were continued by Domenico Fontana (the main facade on the Piazza) and Carlo Maderno, and by Gian Lorenzo Bernini for Pope Clement XII. Gardens were conceived by Maderno. In the 18th century, Ferdinando Fuga built the long wing called the &quot;Manica Lunga&quot;, which stretched 360 meters along via del Quirinale. In front lies the sloping Piazza del Quirinale where the pair of gigantic Roman marble &quot;Horse Tamers&quot; representing Castor and Pollux, found in the Baths of Constantine, were re-erected in 1588. In a view etched by Giovanni Battista Piranesi, the vast open space is unpaved. The Quirinal Palace was the residence of the popes until 1870, though Napoleon deported both Pius VI and Pius VII to France, and declared the Quirinal an imperial palace. When Rome was united to the Kingdom of Italy, the Quirinal became the residence of the kings until 1946.

Today, the palace hosts the offices and the apartments of the Head of State and, in its long side along &quot;via XX Settembre&quot; (the so-called &quot;Manica Lunga&quot;), the apartments that were furnished for each visit of foreign monarchs or dignitaries.

Several collections are in this Palazzo, including tapestries, paintings, statues, old carriages (&quot;carrozze&quot;), watches, furniture, and porcelain.

In Piranesi&#x27;s view, the palazzo on the right is the &quot;Palazzo della Sacra Consulta&quot;, originally a villa built upon the ruins of the Baths of Constantine, which was adapted by Sixtus V as a civil and criminal court. The present façade was built in 1732–1734 by the architect Ferdinando Fuga on the orders of Pope Clement XII Corsini, whose coat-of-arms, trumpeted by two &quot;Fames&quot;, still surmounts the roofline balustrade, as in Piranesi&#x27;s view. It formerly housed Mussolini&#x27;s ministry of colonial affairs.

== Other monuments ==
The hill is the site of other important monuments and buildings. Many of those built during the baroque period reflect the personal and spiritual aspirations of powerful local families:
* The church of Sant&#x27;Andrea al Quirinale was designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1658–1671), for Cardinal Camillo Pamphilii (nephew of Pope Innocent X); it is one of the most elegant samples of baroque architecture in Rome, with its splendid interior of marble, stuccoes, and gilded decorations.
* The four fountains (Quattro Fontane) with reclining river gods (1588–93) commissioned by Pope Sixtus V.
* Borromini&#x27;s church of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane (or San Carlino – originally &quot;Chiesa della Santissima Trinità e di San Carlo Borromeo&quot;), the first and last work of this architect (the façade was completed after his death) commissioned by the Barberini.
* The Piazza and Palazzo Barberini, built by Bernini and Maderno, which now houses the Galleria Nazionale d&#x27;Arte Antica.
*Palazzo Volpi di Misurata, across from San Carlino, built in the 18th century.
* Palazzo Albani del Drago, built by Domenico Fontana and enlarged with an added belvedere, by Alessandro Specchi for the Albani Pope Clement XI; with the decline in the fortunes of Cardinal Alessandro Albani, it was sold to the del Drago, who occupy it still.
* Palazzo Baracchini, built 1876–83, now housing the Ministry of Defense.
* The church of San Silvestro al Quirinale, which was described for the first time circa 1000, rebuilt in the 16th century and restructured (façade) in the 19th.
* The Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot;
* The Palazzo Colonna (17th century), in front of Palazzo Rospigliosi, contains some remains of Caracalla&#x27;s temple of Serapis
* The Palazzo della Consulta hosts today the Constitutional Court, and was erected by Ferdinando Fuga for Pope Clement XII directly opposite Palazzo del Quirinale.
* The Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi (17th century) built by Giorgio Vasanzio and Carlo Maderno
* Proximate to the Baths of Constantine and the modern Sacripanti Palace, there is the dome of Titus Claudinanus and his female partner Claudia Vera. The local water pipes are inscribed with the initials of their names, which define Claudia as the &quot;true girl&quot; (in Latin: &quot;c(larissima) f(emina)&quot;).

<text>Stephen Langton (c. 1150 – 9 July 1228) was an English cardinal of the Catholic Church and Archbishop of Canterbury from 1207 until his death in 1228. The dispute between King John of England and Pope Innocent III over his election was a major factor in the crisis which produced the Magna Carta in 1215. Langton is also credited with having divided the Bible into the standard modern arrangement of chapters used today.

==Early life and career==
His father was Henry Langton, a landowner in Langton by Wragby, Lincolnshire. Stephen Langton may have been born in a moated farmhouse in the village, and was probably educated in his local cathedral school. He could also have been born at Friday Street, Surrey, according to local legend.

Stephen studied at the University of Paris and lectured there on theology until 1206, when Pope Innocent III, with whom he had formed a friendship in Paris, called him to Rome and made him cardinal-priest of San Crisogono, Rome. His piety and learning had already won him prebends in Paris and York and he was recognised as the foremost English churchman.

His brother Simon Langton was elected Archbishop of York in 1215, but that election was quashed by Pope Innocent III. Simon served his brother Stephen as Archdeacon of Canterbury in 1227. Simon and Stephen had another brother named Walter, a knight who died childless.

==Archbishop==

On the death of Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1205, the election of a successor encountered difficulties: some of the younger canons of the cathedral chapter elected Reginald, the subprior of Christ Church, Canterbury, as Archbishop while another faction under pressure from King John chose John de Grey, Bishop of Norwich. Both elections were quashed on appeal to Rome, and sixteen canons of the chapter, who had gone to Rome with a mandate to act for the whole chapter, were ordered to proceed to a new election in presence of the Pope. The choice fell upon Langton and he was consecrated by the Pope at Viterbo on 17 June 1207.

There followed a hard political struggle between John of England and Pope Innocent III. The King proclaimed as a public enemy anyone who recognised Stephen as Archbishop. On 15 July 1207, John expelled the Canterbury chapter, which was now unanimous in support of Stephen. In March 1208, Pope Innocent III placed England under an interdict and at the close of 1212, after repeated negotiations had failed, he passed sentence of deposition against John, committing the execution of the sentence to Philip II of France in January 1213.

In May 1213 King John yielded and thus in July, Stephen and his fellow exiles returned to England. Till that moment, he had lived since his consecration at Pontigny Abbey in Burgundy. His first act as Archbishop was to absolve the King, who swore an oath (which he almost immediately violated) guaranteeing that unjust laws should be repealed and the liberties granted by Henry I should be observed.

Stephen now became a leader in the struggle against King John. At a council of churchmen at Westminster on 25 August 1213, to which certain barons were invited, he read the text of the charter of Henry I and called for its renewal. In the sequel, Stephen&#x27;s energetic leadership and the barons&#x27; military strength forced John to grant his seal to &quot;Magna Carta&quot; (15 June 1215).
Since King John now held his kingdom as a fief of the Holy See the Pope espoused his cause and excommunicated the barons. For refusing to publish the excommunication the king had Stephen suspended from all ecclesiastical functions by the papal commissioners and on 4 November this sentence was confirmed by the Pope, although Stephen appealed to him in person. He was released from suspension the following spring on condition that he keep out of England until peace was restored, and he remained abroad till May 1218. Meanwhile, both Pope Innocent and King John died and all parties in England rallied to the support of Henry III.

Stephen Langton continued under Henry&#x27;s reign to work for the political independence of England. In 1223 he again appeared as the leader and spokesman of the barons, who demanded that King Henry confirm the charter. He went to France on Henry&#x27;s behalf to call on Louis VIII of France for the restoration of Normandy, and later he supported Henry against rebellious barons. He obtained a promise from the new pope, Honorius III, that during his lifetime no resident papal legate should be again sent to England, and won other concessions from the same pontiff favourable to the English Church and exalting the see of Canterbury.

Of great importance in the ecclesiastical history of England was a council which Stephen opened at Osney on 17 April 1222; its decrees, known as the &quot;Constitutions of Stephen Langton&quot;, are the earliest provincial canons which are still recognised as binding in English Church courts.

In 1221 Langton approved the settlement of friars of the Order of Preachers (Blackfriars) in England. They were conveyed by Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester, to Canterbury where the leader of the first group of friars, Gilbert of Fresney, was asked to preach an impromptu sermon on the merits of his new order. Satisfied with his quality of preaching the friars were permitted to found priories across the country.

==Death==
Stephen Langton died at Slindon, near Chichester, Sussex, on 9 July 1228. He was buried in open ground beside the south transept of Canterbury Cathedral. St Michael&#x27;s Chapel was later built over this ground (now the Buffs Regimental Chapel), and the head of his tomb projects into the east end of this chapel, under its altar, with the foot outside it.

The &quot;Stephen Langton Trail&quot;, devised to celebrate the 800th anniversary of the sealing of Magna Carta, starts in Langton by Wragby and leads to Lincoln Cathedral, close to Lincoln Castle where there is an original copy of the charter.

==Works==
Langton wrote prolifically. His many sermons and his glosses, commentaries, expositions, and treatises on almost all the books of the Old Testament are preserved in manuscript at Lambeth Palace, at Oxford and Cambridge, and in France.

According to F. J. E. Raby, &quot;There is little reason to doubt that Stephen Langton ... was the author&quot; of the famous sequence &quot;Veni Sancte Spiritus&quot;.

The only other of his works which has been printed, besides a few letters (in &quot;The Historical Works of Gervase of Canterbury&quot;, ed. W. Stubbs, ii. London, 1880, &quot;Rolls Series,&quot; no. 71, appendix to preface) is a &quot;Tractatus de translatione Beati Thomae&quot; (in J. A. Giles&#x27;s &quot;Thomas of Canterbury&quot;, Oxford, 1845), which is probably an expansion of a sermon he preached in 1220, on the occasion of the translation of the relics of Thomas Becket; the ceremony was the most splendid that had ever been seen in England. He also wrote a life of Richard I, and other historical works and poems are attributed to him.

===Chapters of the Bible===
Classically, scrolls of the books of the Bible have always been divided by blank spaces at the end (&quot;petuhoth&quot;) or middle (&quot;setumoth&quot;) of the lines. However, Langton is believed to be the one who divided the Bible into the standard modern arrangement of chapters. While Cardinal Hugo de Sancto Caro is also known to have come up with a systematic division of the Bible (between 1244 and 1248), it is Langton&#x27;s arrangement of the chapters that remains in use today.

<text>Design by contract (DbC), also known as contract programming, programming by contract and design-by-contract programming, is an approach for designing software.

It prescribes that software designers should define formal, precise and verifiable interface specifications for software components, which extend the ordinary definition of abstract data types with preconditions, postconditions and invariants. These specifications are referred to as &quot;contracts&quot;, in accordance with a conceptual metaphor with the conditions and obligations of business contracts.

The DbC approach assumes all &quot;client components&quot; that invoke an operation on a &quot;server component&quot; will meet the preconditions specified as required for that operation.

Where this assumption is considered too risky (as in multi-channel or distributed computing), the inverse approach is taken, meaning that the &quot;server component&quot; tests that all relevant preconditions hold true (before, or while, processing the &quot;client component&quot;&#x27;s request) and replies with a suitable error message if not.

==History==
The term was coined by Bertrand Meyer in connection with his design of the Eiffel programming language and first described in various articles starting in 1986 and the two successive editions (1988, 1997) of his book &quot;Object-Oriented Software Construction&quot;. Eiffel Software applied for trademark registration for &quot;Design by Contract&quot; in December 2003, and it was granted in December 2004. The current owner of this trademark is Eiffel Software.

Design by contract has its roots in work on formal verification, formal specification and Hoare logic. The original contributions include:
*A clear metaphor to guide the design process
*The application to inheritance, in particular a formalism for redefinition and dynamic binding
*The application to exception handling
*The connection with automatic software documentation

==Description==
The central idea of DbC is a metaphor on how elements of a software system collaborate with each other on the basis of mutual &quot;obligations&quot; and &quot;benefits&quot;. The metaphor comes from business life, where a &quot;client&quot; and a &quot;supplier&quot; agree on a &quot;contract&quot; that defines, for example, that:

*The supplier must provide a certain product (obligation) and is entitled to expect that the client has paid its fee (benefit).
*The client must pay the fee (obligation) and is entitled to get the product (benefit).
*Both parties must satisfy certain obligations, such as laws and regulations, applying to all contracts.

Similarly, if the method of a class in object-oriented programming provides a certain functionality, it may:

* Expect a certain condition to be guaranteed on entry by any client module that calls it: the method&#x27;s precondition—an obligation for the client, and a benefit for the supplier (the method itself), as it frees it from having to handle cases outside of the precondition.
* Guarantee a certain property on exit: the method&#x27;s postcondition—an obligation for the supplier, and obviously a benefit (the main benefit of calling the method) for the client.
* Maintain a certain property, assumed on entry and guaranteed on exit: the class invariant.

The contract is semantically equivalent to a Hoare triple which formalises the obligations. This can be summarised by the &quot;three questions&quot; that the designer must repeatedly answer in the contract:
* What does the contract expect?
* What does the contract guarantee?
* What does the contract maintain?

Many programming languages have facilities to make assertions like these. However, DbC considers these contracts to be so crucial to software correctness that they should be part of the design process. In effect, DbC advocates writing the assertions first. Contracts can be written by code comments, enforced by a test suite, or both, even if there is no special language support for contracts.

The notion of a contract extends down to the method/procedure level; the contract for each method will normally contain the following pieces of information:
* Acceptable and unacceptable input values or types, and their meanings
* Return values or types, and their meanings
* Error and exception condition values or types that can occur, and their meanings
* Side effects
* Preconditions
* Postconditions
* Invariants
* (more rarely) Performance guarantees, e.g. for time or space used

Subclasses in an inheritance hierarchy are allowed to weaken preconditions (but not strengthen them) and strengthen postconditions and invariants (but not weaken them). These rules approximate behavioural subtyping.

All class relationships are between client classes and supplier classes. A client class is obliged to make calls to supplier features where the resulting state of the supplier is not violated by the client call. Subsequently, the supplier is obliged to provide a return state and data that does not violate the state requirements of the client.

For instance, a supplier data buffer may require that data is present in the buffer when a delete feature is called. Subsequently, the supplier guarantees to the client that when a delete feature finishes its work, the data item will, indeed, be deleted from the buffer. Other design contracts are concepts of class invariant. The class invariant guarantees (for the local class) that the state of the class will be maintained within specified tolerances at the end of each feature execution.

When using contracts, a supplier should not try to verify that the contract conditions are satisfied—a practice known as offensive programming—the general idea being that code should &quot;fail hard&quot;, with contract verification being the safety net.

DbC&#x27;s &quot;fail hard&quot; property simplifies the debugging of contract behavior, as the intended behaviour of each method is clearly specified.

This approach differs substantially from that of defensive programming, where the supplier is responsible for figuring out what to do when a precondition is broken. More often than not, the supplier throws an exception to inform the client that the precondition has been broken, and in both cases—DbC and defensive programming alike—the client must figure out how to respond to that. In such cases, DbC makes the supplier&#x27;s job easier.

Design by contract also defines criteria for correctness for a software module:
* If the class invariant AND precondition are true before a supplier is called by a client, then the invariant AND the postcondition will be true after the service has been completed.
* When making calls to a supplier, a software module should not violate the supplier&#x27;s preconditions.

Design by contract can also facilitate code reuse, since the contract for each piece of code is fully documented. The contracts for a module can be regarded as a form of software documentation for the behavior of that module.

==Performance implications==
Contract conditions should never be violated during execution of a bug-free program. Contracts are therefore typically only checked in debug mode during software development. Later at release, the contract checks are disabled to maximize performance.

In many programming languages, contracts are implemented with assert. Asserts are by default compiled away in release mode in C/C++, and similarly deactivated in C# and Java.

Launching the Python interpreter with &quot;-O&quot; (for &quot;optimize&quot;) as an argument will likewise cause the Python code generator to not emit any bytecode for asserts.

This effectively eliminates the run-time costs of asserts in production code—irrespective of the number and computational expense of asserts used in development—as no such instructions will be included in production by the compiler.

==Relationship to software testing==
Design by contract does not replace regular testing strategies, such as unit testing, integration testing and system testing. Rather, it complements external testing with internal self-tests that can be activated both for isolated tests and in production code during a test-phase.

The advantage of internal self-tests is that they can detect errors before they manifest themselves as invalid results observed by the client. This leads to earlier and more specific error detection.

The use of assertions can be considered to be a form of test oracle, a way of testing the design by contract implementation.

==Language support==

===Languages with native support===
Languages that implement most DbC features natively include:
* Ada 2012
* Ciao
* Clojure
* Cobra
* D
* Dafny
* Eiffel
* Fortress
* Kotlin
* Mercury
* Oxygene (formerly Chrome and Delphi Prism)
* Racket (including higher order contracts, and emphasizing that contract violations must blame the guilty party and must do so with an accurate explanation)
* Sather
* Scala
* SPARK (via static analysis of Ada programs)
* Vala
* VDM

Additionally, the standard method combination in the Common Lisp Object System has the method qualifiers codice_1, codice_2 and codice_3 that allow writing contracts as auxiliary methods, among other uses.

<doc id="39290" wikidata="Q1413450" url="?curid=39290" title="Precondition">
<text>In computer programming, a precondition is a condition or predicate that must always be true just prior to the execution of some section of code or before an operation in a formal specification.

If a precondition is violated, the effect of the section of code becomes undefined and thus may or may not carry out its intended work. Preconditions that are missing, insufficient, or not formally proved (or have an incorrect attempted proof), or are not checked statically or dynamically, can give rise to Security problems, particularly in unsafe languages that are not strongly typed.

Often, preconditions are simply included in the documentation of the affected section of code. Preconditions are sometimes tested using guards or assertions within the code itself, and some languages have specific syntactic constructions for doing so.

==Example==
The factorial function is only defined where its parameter is an integer greater than or equal to zero. So an implementation of the factorial function would have a precondition that its parameter be an integer &quot;and&quot; that the parameter be greater than or equal to zero. Alternatively the type system of the language may be used to specify that the parameter of the factorial function is a natural number (unsigned integer), which can be formally verified automatically by a compiler&#x27;s type checker.

In addition where numeric types have a limited range (as they do in most programming languages) the precondition must also specify the maximum value that the parameter may have if overflow is not to occur. (e.g. if an implementation of factorial returns the result in a 64-bit unsigned integer then the parameter must be less than 21 because factorial(21) is larger than the maximum unsigned integer that can be stored in 64 bits). 
Where the language supports range sub-types (e.g. Ada) such constraints can be automatically verified by the type system. More complex constraints can be formally verified interactively with a proof assistant. 

==In object-oriented programming==
Preconditions in object-oriented software development are an essential part of design by contract. Design by contract also includes notions of postcondition and class invariant. 

The precondition for any routine defines any constraints on object state which are necessary for successful execution. From the program developer&#x27;s viewpoint, this constitutes the routine caller&#x27;s portion of the contract. The caller then is obliged to ensure that the precondition holds prior to calling the routine. The reward for the caller&#x27;s effort is expressed in the called routine&#x27;s postcondition.

===Eiffel example===
The routine in the following example written in Eiffel takes as an argument an integer which must be a valid value for an hour of the day, i. e., 0 through 23, inclusively. The precondition follows the keyword codice_1. It specifies that the argument must be greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to 23. The tag &quot;codice_2&quot; describes this precondition clause and serves to identify it in case of a runtime precondition violation.
 set_hour (a_hour: INTEGER)
 -- Set `hour&#x27; to `a_hour&#x27;
 require
 valid_argument: 0 &lt;= a_hour and a_hour &lt;= 23
 do
 hour := a_hour
 ensure
 hour_set: hour = a_hour
 end
===Preconditions and inheritance===
In the presence of inheritance, the routines inherited by descendant classes (subclasses) do so with their preconditions in force. This means that any implementations or redefinitions of inherited routines also have to be written to comply with their inherited contract. Preconditions can be modified in redefined routines, but they may only be weakened. That is, the redefined routine may lessen the obligation of the client, but not increase it.

<doc id="39291" wikidata="Q360690" url="?curid=39291" title="Postcondition">
<text>In computer programming, a postcondition is a condition or predicate that must always be true just after the execution of some section of code or after an operation in a formal specification. Postconditions are sometimes tested using assertions within the code itself. Often, postconditions are simply included in the documentation of the affected section of code.

For example: The result of a factorial is always an integer and greater than or equal to 1. So a program that calculates the factorial of an input number would have postconditions that the result after the calculation be an integer and that it be greater than or equal to 1. Another example: a program that calculates the square root of an input number might have the postconditions that the result be a number and that its square be equal to the input.

==Postconditions in object-oriented programming==
In some software design approaches, postconditions, along with preconditions and class invariants, are components of the software construction method design by contract.

The postcondition for any routine is a declaration of the properties which are guaranteed upon completion of the routine&#x27;s execution. As it relates to the routine&#x27;s contract, the postcondition offers assurance to potential callers that in cases in which the routine is called in a state in which its precondition holds, the properties declared by the postcondition are assured.

==Eiffel example==

The following example written in Eiffel sets the value of a class attribute codice_1 based on a caller-provided argument codice_2. The postcondition follows the keyword codice_3. In this example, the postcondition guarantees, in cases in which the precondition holds (i.e., when codice_2 represents a valid hour of the day), that after the execution of codice_5, the class attribute codice_1 will have the same value as codice_2. The tag &quot;codice_8&quot; describes this postcondition clause and serves to identify it in case of a runtime postcondition violation.
 set_hour (a_hour: INTEGER)
 -- Set `hour&#x27; to `a_hour&#x27;
 require
 valid_argument: 0 &lt;= a_hour and a_hour &lt;= 23
 do
 hour := a_hour
 ensure
 hour_set: hour = a_hour
 end
==Postconditions and inheritance==
In the presence of inheritance, the routines inherited by descendant classes (subclasses) do so with their contracts, that is their preconditions and postconditions, in force. This means that any implementations or redefinitions of inherited routines also have to be written to comply with their inherited contracts. Postconditions can be modified in redefined routines, but they may only be strengthened. That is, the redefined routine may increase the benefits it provides to the client, but may not decrease those benefits.

<text>Time Crisis is a 1995 light-gun shooter video game developed and published by Namco for arcades. It is the first installment in the &quot;Time Crisis&quot; series. The game differentiated itself from other light gun shooters of the time by incorporating a pedal that controls when the player character takes cover to reload and avoid enemy fire. Players have a limited amount of time to clear each section by defeating enemies. The game&#x27;s story focuses on Richard Miller, a secret agent, who is sent to rescue a kidnapped woman from a ruthless tyrant seeking to reclaim control of their former country from a new regime.

A port of the game for the PlayStation was released in 1997, as part of a bundle coinciding with the launch of the Guncon light gun controller, and featured an add-on pack of additional stages that are set after the main story. Both the arcade original and the console version were well-received by critics, in particular the gameplay mechanics. The game proved a commercial success and spawned a sequel, &quot;Time Crisis II&quot;, in 1997 while the PlayStation version got its own sequel, &quot;Time Crisis: Project Titan&quot;, in 2001.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Time Crisis&quot; is a three-dimensional first-person rail shooter similar to &quot;Virtua Cop&quot;, in that the player holds a light gun and fires at on-screen enemies. However, it differs from such video games by use of its cover system - a gameplay mechanic in which players can duck behind cover to avoid enemy fire and reload their weapons. In the arcade version, a foot pedal is used to toggle between ducking and attacking positions; in console conversions, a button command replicates the foot pedal&#x27;s functions. The PlayStation version also allows players to use the pedal from a racing wheel peripheral, or even by pressing a button on a controller plugged into port 2 by hand; some players fashioned home-made pedals that, when stepped on, pressed down a button on the second controller on the floor instead.

The game consists of three stages, each consisting of three areas and a boss battle. Each area consist of a series of firearms battles, in which players must defeat a set group of enemies in order to advance to the next battle. Each area features a one minute time limit to begin with, which counts down during battles and transitions between each, and is only extended by clearing a current battle; defeating certain optional enemies also gives a few extra seconds. To avoid running down the clock, the player must take risks, shooting enemies rapidly and hiding only when necessary. Each playthrough sees the player given a set number of lives, in which one is deducted when the player is hit by an enemy, or fails to avoid being hit by a hazard in the current battle, with the game being over when the player runs out of lives or time.

The arcade cabinet&#x27;s light gun (introduced in &quot;Point Blank&quot;) utilizes a special memory chip to synchronize areas of the screen&#x27;s image as the player rotates the gun around. The light gun also features a blowback function which simulates real-life gun recoil, this feature isn&#x27;t retained in the PlayStation port. The PlayStation port can be played either with the GunCon light gun peripheral or by using a controller to aim a cursor around the screen. The port features an exclusive Special mode, in which the player&#x27;s performance, such as how quickly they can clear an area, affects the path they take through the game, resulting in multiple possibilities and endings.

==Plot==
In 1995, the V.S.S.E., an international protection agency, helps Sercian opposition leader William MacPherson engineer a coup that overthrows a century-old authoritarian regime. MacPherson is elected as the Sercian republic&#x27;s first president. Sherudo Garo, the last survivor of the regime, plots to restore the old order, launching a series of attacks and assassinations that destabilize the nation. As the finishing touch, Sherudo has President MacPherson&#x27;s daughter Rachel abducted and imprisoned in his family&#x27;s castle on a remote island, demanding vital military secrets in exchange for her life. A desperate MacPherson contacts the V.S.S.E., who in turn dispatches veteran agent Richard Miller, the &quot;One Man Army&quot;, to infiltrate the castle and rescue Rachel.

Richard reaches the island and rams his explosives-rigged boat into the castle&#x27;s exterior to create an entrance. Sherudo hears the resulting boom, but his head of security, Wild Dog, assures him that Richard will not last long against his highly trained mercenaries. Meanwhile, Richard confronts Wild Dog&#x27;s troops in the submarine hangar and makes his way to the main courtyard against heavy resistance, eventually reaching Rachel&#x27;s location. She warns him of a setup before being whisked away. Richard is confronted by Sherudo&#x27;s chief assassin Moz and his unit. He defeats them and interrogates Moz, who reveals that Rachel has been transferred to the clock tower. There, Richard is attacked by Sherudo, a trained knife thrower, and guns him down, only to find Rachel held at gunpoint by Wild Dog. Angered by Sherudo&#x27;s death, Wild Dog reveals his intentions to blow up the castle with Richard inside and escape with Rachel. Pursuing them to the castle&#x27;s helipad, Richard arrives just as Rachel manages to break free, leading Wild Dog to shoot her. A furious Richard engages Wild Dog in a fast-and-loose gun battle across the rooftop, during which Dog accidentally sets off his detonator, apparently killing himself in a fiery explosion. Richard collects the wounded Rachel and escapes in Wild Dog&#x27;s chopper just as the rest of the castle goes up in flames.

The PlayStation version features a special mission known as the &quot;Kantaris Deal&quot;, which takes place several weeks after the main story&#x27;s events. Richard is alerted by V.S.S.E. to the presence of an illegal arms factory posing as a Sercian hotel, with ties to Wild Dog&#x27;s organization. He is assigned to infiltrate the factory and eliminate its owner, Kantaris. Upon clearing the lobby, Richard has three different paths to his target. The first takes him through the ballroom/casino, where he eliminates Kantaris&#x27; boomerang-flinging assassin, Web Spinner. He then pursues her to the swimming pool just as she attempts to escape by air. After shooting down an escort gunship, Richard damages the engines of Kantaris&#x27; ship just as it takes off, causing it to crash and explode. Should Richard fail to stop Web Spinner in time, he will instead be taken to the arms factory; and should Richard fail to pursue Kantaris in time, he will instead be taken to Kantaris&#x27; office in the lounge. The second path, which can only be accessed if there are less than 22 seconds left on the clock, instead goes through the shopping mall and down into a garbage disposal. There, Richard uses a claw arm to punch a hole in the wall, allowing him to access the underground arms factory. From there, he makes his way to Kantaris&#x27; office in the lounge and defeats her personal security droid, which then malfunctions and rolls out the window, taking her with it. Should Richard fail his pursuit in the arms factory, he will instead be redirected to the parking lot. The third path can be made available if Richard does not activate the claw in time. Instead of entering the factory, he goes directly through the parking lot. After defeating a spider-legged battle tank, Richard disables Kantaris&#x27; car, forcing it to crash. If in any of these scenarios Richard fails to take action soon enough, Kantaris escapes and the mission is aborted (canonically, the spin-off game &quot;Time Crisis: Project Titan&quot; takes place after the mission&#x27;s failure).

==Development==

Though both the arcade and PlayStation versions were developed internally at Namco, none of the arcade development team had any direct involvement with the PlayStation version. Since the PlayStation&#x27;s CPU speed is much lower than that of the System 22 arcade hardware, the team reduced demands on the PlayStation CPU by cutting the game&#x27;s frame rate in half, reducing the number of polygons used, emulating the real-time lighting by coloring the polygons one-by-one, and delaying the appearance of enemies so that only a certain number of enemies could appear on-screen at any time.

The development team took photos of hotels and factories in the Tokyo area as reference for the PlayStation mode&#x27;s hotel design. To make the large areas in the hotel work on the hardware, the team left the portions of these areas not visible to the player unrendered. Three planned sequences - an outdoor restaurant, a missile room explosion, and a boat race - were left out because the team eventually realized that creating them was not practical, at least not within the time they had to complete the PlayStation version. New music was recorded for the Special Mission mode by Tatsuro Tani and Tomoko Tat2, using a &quot;synthesized orchestra&quot; of 50 individually synthesized instruments.

==Reception==
The Japanese arcade magazine &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Time Crisis&quot; as being the most-successful arcade game of the month in April 1996.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; hailed the game as being superior even to competitor Sega&#x27;s &quot;Virtua Cop 2&quot;, primarily due to the unique foot pedal maneuver. The reviewer remarked that &quot;By creating this innovative maneuvering technique, in addition to time-based, predetermined path running, providing Story or Attack mode and challenging end-level bosses, &quot;Time Crisis&quot; thrusts the light-gun genre into a brand-new territory - and develops a whole new way of looking at, and playing, the classic light-gun game.&quot;

The PlayStation version received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Critics applauded the close conversion of the arcade game, and said the special PlayStation mode greatly extended the game&#x27;s lifespan, and was even superior to the original arcade campaign. And though &quot;GamePro&quot; questioned the accuracy of the bundled GunCon peripheral, reporting that &quot;there are times when dead-on shots seem to miss&quot;, the overwhelming majority of critics deemed it the best light gun yet released for the PlayStation.

A number of critics found that despite the innovative ducking mechanic, the game is too simplistic, in particular that it lacks any powerups or innocent bystanders that the player must avoid shooting. The lack of a multiplayer mode was also criticized, since this was a standard feature in light gun shooters. The British &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; complained at the slowness of the PAL conversion, with reviewer Tom Guise saying that though he otherwise preferred &quot;Time Crisis&quot; over &quot;Virtua Cop&quot;, when it came to the games&#x27; respective British home releases he favored the fully PAL-optimized &quot;Virtua Cop&quot;. However, these criticisms had little impact on overall recommendations; Guise concluded that &quot;these factors cannot stop this game from being a High Five&quot; and &quot;Next Generation&quot; stated that &quot;when compared to other light-gun shooters for home systems, &quot;Time Crisis&quot; is as good as it gets.&quot;

There was some disagreement over which of the PlayStation version&#x27;s three methods of emulating the arcade version&#x27;s foot pedal was best. &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the reload button on the GunCon for forcing the player to use a more realistic two-handed grip, while &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; and &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; both said stepping on the standard joypad&#x27;s buttons offers the best combination of accuracy and similarity to the foot pedal.

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; named the PlayStation version &quot;Light Gun Game of the Year&quot; at their 1997 Editors&#x27; Choice Awards, noting that the game won the unanimous vote of the editors. While they added that this was not as much of an accomplishment as it normally would be, due to the weakness of that year&#x27;s competition for the category, they also said the win was well-earned by &quot;Time Crisis&quot;″s graphics, sound effects, and additional modes of play.

<text>In software quality assurance, performance testing is in general a testing practice performed to determine how a system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a particular workload. It can also serve to investigate, measure, validate or verify other quality attributes of the system, such as scalability, reliability and resource usage.

Performance testing, a subset of performance engineering, is a computer science practice which strives to build performance standards into the implementation, design and architecture of a system.

== Testing types ==
=== Load testing ===
Load testing is the simplest form of performance testing. A load test is usually conducted to understand the behavior of the system under a specific expected load. This load can be the expected concurrent number of users on the application performing a specific number of transactions within the set duration. This test will give out the response times of all the important business critical transactions. The database, application server, etc. are also monitored during the test, this will assist in identifying bottlenecks in the application software and the hardware that the software is installed on

=== Stress testing ===
Stress testing is normally used to understand the upper limits of capacity within the system. This kind of test is done to determine the system&#x27;s robustness in terms of extreme load and helps application administrators to determine if the system will perform sufficiently if the current load goes well above the expected maximum.

=== Soak testing ===
Soak testing, also known as endurance testing, is usually done to determine if the system can sustain the continuous expected load. During soak tests, memory utilization is monitored to detect potential leaks. Also important, but often overlooked is performance degradation, i.e. to ensure that the throughput and/or response times after some long period of sustained activity are as good as or better than at the beginning of the test. It essentially involves applying a significant load to a system for an extended, significant period of time. The goal is to discover how the system behaves under sustained use.

=== Spike testing ===
Spike testing is done by suddenly increasing or decreasing the load generated by a very large number of users, and observing the behavior of the system. The goal is to determine whether performance will suffer, the system will fail, or it will be able to handle dramatic changes in load.

=== Breakpoint testing ===
Breakpoint testing is similar to stress testing. An incremental load is applied over time while the system is monitored for predetermined failure conditions. Breakpoint testing is sometimes referred to as Capacity Testing because it can be said to determine the maximum capacity below which the system will perform to its required specifications or Service Level Agreements. The results of breakpoint analysis applied to a fixed environment can be used to determine the optimal scaling strategy in terms of required hardware or conditions that should trigger scaling-out events in a cloud environment.

=== Configuration testing ===
Rather than testing for performance from a load perspective, tests are created to determine the effects of configuration changes to the system&#x27;s components on the system&#x27;s performance and behavior. A common example would be experimenting with different methods of load-balancing.

=== Isolation testing ===
Isolation testing is not unique to performance testing but involves repeating a test execution that resulted in a system problem. Such testing can often isolate and confirm the fault domain.

=== Internet testing ===
This is a relatively new form of performance testing when global applications such as Facebook, Google and Wikipedia, are performance tested from load generators that are placed on the actual target continent whether physical machines or cloud VMs. These tests usually requires an immense amount of preparation and monitoring to be executed successfully.

== Setting performance goals ==
Performance testing can serve different purposes:

* It can demonstrate that the system meets performance criteria.
* It can compare two systems to find which performs better.
* It can measure which parts of the system or workload cause the system to perform badly.

Many performance tests are undertaken without setting sufficiently realistic, goal-oriented performance goals. The first question from a business perspective should always be, &quot;why are we performance-testing?&quot;. These considerations are part of the business case of the testing. Performance goals will differ depending on the system&#x27;s technology and purpose, but should always include some of the following:

=== Concurrency and throughput ===
If a system identifies end-users by some form of log-in procedure then a concurrency goal is highly desirable. By definition this is the largest number of concurrent system users that the system is expected to support at any given moment. The work-flow of a scripted transaction may impact true concurrency especially if the iterative part contains the log-in and log-out activity.

If the system has no concept of end-users, then performance goal is likely to be based on a maximum throughput or transaction rate.

=== Server response time ===
This refers to the time taken for one system node to respond to the request of another. A simple example would be a HTTP &#x27;GET&#x27; request from browser client to web server. In terms of response time this is what all load testing tools actually measure. It may be relevant to set server response time goals between all nodes of the system.

=== Render response time ===
Load-testing tools have difficulty measuring render-response time, since they generally have no concept of what happens within a node apart from recognizing a period of time where there is no activity &#x27;on the wire&#x27;. To measure render response time, it is generally necessary to include functional test scripts as part of the performance test scenario. Many load testing tools do not offer this feature.

=== Performance specifications ===
It is critical to detail performance specifications (requirements) and document them in any performance test plan. Ideally, this is done during the requirements development phase of any system development project, prior to any design effort. See Performance Engineering for more details.

However, performance testing is frequently not performed against a specification; e.g., no one will have expressed what the maximum acceptable response time for a given population of users should be. Performance testing is frequently used as part of the process of performance profile tuning. The idea is to identify the &quot;weakest link&quot; – there is inevitably a part of the system which, if it is made to respond faster, will result in the overall system running faster. It is sometimes a difficult task to identify which part of the system represents this critical path, and some test tools include (or can have add-ons that provide) instrumentation that runs on the server (agents) and reports transaction times, database access times, network overhead, and other server monitors, which can be analyzed together with the raw performance statistics. Without such instrumentation one might have to have someone crouched over Windows Task Manager at the server to see how much CPU load the performance tests are generating (assuming a Windows system is under test).

Performance testing can be performed across the web, and even done in different parts of the country, since it is known that the response times of the internet itself vary regionally. It can also be done in-house, although routers would then need to be configured to introduce the lag that would typically occur on public networks. Loads should be introduced to the system from realistic points. For example, if 50% of a system&#x27;s user base will be accessing the system via a 56K modem connection and the other half over a T1, then the load injectors (computers that simulate real users) should either inject load over the same mix of connections (ideal) or simulate the network latency of such connections, following the same user profile.

It is always helpful to have a statement of the likely peak number of users that might be expected to use the system at peak times. If there can also be a statement of what constitutes the maximum allowable 95 percentile response time, then an injector configuration could be used to test whether the proposed system met that specification.

=== Questions to ask ===
Performance specifications should ask the following questions, at a minimum:

* In detail, what is the performance test scope? What subsystems, interfaces, components, etc. are in and out of scope for this test?
* For the user interfaces (UIs) involved, how many concurrent users are expected for each (specify peak vs. nominal)?
* What does the target system (hardware) look like (specify all server and network appliance configurations)?
* What is the Application Workload Mix of each system component? (for example: 20% log-in, 40% search, 30% item select, 10% checkout).
* What is the System Workload Mix? [Multiple workloads may be simulated in a single performance test] (for example: 30% Workload A, 20% Workload B, 50% Workload C).
* What are the time requirements for any/all back-end batch processes (specify peak vs. nominal)?

== Prerequisites ==
A stable build of the system which must resemble the production environment as closely as is possible.

To ensure consistent results, the performance testing environment should be isolated from other environments, such as user acceptance testing (UAT) or development. As a best practice it is always advisable to have a separate performance testing environment resembling the production environment as much as possible.

=== Test conditions ===
In performance testing, it is often crucial for the test conditions to be similar to the expected actual use. However, in practice this is hard to arrange and not wholly possible, since production systems are subjected to unpredictable workloads. Test workloads may mimic occurrences in the production environment as far as possible, but only in the simplest systems can one exactly replicate this workload variability.

Loosely-coupled architectural implementations (e.g.: SOA) have created additional complexities with performance testing. To truly replicate production-like states, enterprise services or assets that share a common infrastructure or platform require coordinated performance testing, with all consumers creating production-like transaction volumes and load on shared infrastructures or platforms. Because this activity is so complex and costly in money and time, some organizations now use tools to monitor and simulate production-like conditions (also referred as &quot;noise&quot;) in their performance testing environments (PTE) to understand capacity and resource requirements and verify / validate quality attributes.

=== Timing ===
It is critical to the cost performance of a new system that performance test efforts begin at the inception of the development project and extend through to deployment. The later a performance defect is detected, the higher the cost of remediation. This is true in the case of functional testing, but even more so with performance testing, due to the end-to-end nature of its scope. It is crucial for a performance test team to be involved as early as possible, because it is time-consuming to acquire and prepare the testing environment and other key performance requisites.

== Tools ==
Performance testing is mainly divided into two main categories:

=== Performance scripting ===
This part of performance testing mainly deals with creating/scripting the work flows of key identified business processes. This can be done using a wide variety of tools.

Each of the tools mentioned in the above list (which is not exhaustive nor complete) either employs a scripting language (C, Java, JS) or some form of visual representation (drag and drop) to create and simulate end user work flows. Most of the tools allow for something called &quot;Record &amp; Replay&quot;, where in the performance tester will launch the testing tool, hook it on a browser or thick client and capture all the network transactions which happen between the client and server. In doing so a script is developed which can be enhanced/modified to emulate various business scenarios.

=== Performance monitoring ===
This forms the other face of performance testing. With performance monitoring, the behavior and response characteristics of the application under test are observed. The below parameters are usually monitored during the a performance test execution

Server hardware Parameters

* CPU Utilization
* Memory Utilization
* Disk utilization
* Network utilization

As a first step, the patterns generated by these 4 parameters provide a good indication on where the bottleneck lies. To determine the exact root cause of the issue, software engineers use tools such as profilers to measure what parts of a device or software contribute most to the poor performance, or to establish throughput levels (and thresholds) for maintained acceptable response time.

== Technology ==
Performance testing technology employs one or more PCs or Unix servers to act as injectors, each emulating the presence of numbers of users and each running an automated sequence of interactions (recorded as a script, or as a series of scripts to emulate different types of user interaction) with the host whose performance is being tested. Usually, a separate PC acts as a test conductor, coordinating and gathering metrics from each of the injectors and collating performance data for reporting purposes. The usual sequence is to ramp up the load: to start with a few virtual users and increase the number over time to a predetermined maximum. The test result shows how the performance varies with the load, given as number of users vs. response time. Various tools are available to perform such tests. Tools in this category usually execute a suite of tests which emulate real users against the system. Sometimes the results can reveal oddities, e.g., that while the average response time might be acceptable, there are outliers of a few key transactions that take considerably longer to complete – something that might be caused by inefficient database queries, pictures, etc.

Performance testing can be combined with stress testing, in order to see what happens when an acceptable load is exceeded. Does the system crash? How long does it take to recover if a large load is reduced? Does its failure cause collateral damage?

Analytical Performance Modeling is a method to model the behavior of a system in a spreadsheet. The model is fed with measurements of transaction resource demands (CPU, disk I/O, LAN, WAN), weighted by the transaction-mix (business transactions per hour). The weighted transaction resource demands are added up to obtain the hourly resource demands and divided by the hourly resource capacity to obtain the resource loads. Using the response time formula (R=S/(1-U), R=response time, S=service time, U=load), response times can be calculated and calibrated with the results of the performance tests. Analytical performance modeling allows evaluation of design options and system sizing based on actual or anticipated business use. It is therefore much faster and cheaper than performance testing, though it requires thorough understanding of the hardware platforms.

== Tasks to undertake ==
Tasks to perform such a test would include:

* Decide whether to use internal or external resources to perform the tests, depending on inhouse expertise (or lack of it).
* Gather or elicit performance requirements (specifications) from users and/or business analysts.
* Develop a high-level plan (or project charter), including requirements, resources, timelines and milestones.
* Develop a detailed performance test plan (including detailed scenarios and test cases, workloads, environment info, etc.).
* Choose test tool(s).
* Specify test data needed and charter effort (often overlooked, but vital to carrying out a valid performance test).
* Develop proof-of-concept scripts for each application/component under test, using chosen test tools and strategies.
* Develop detailed performance test project plan, including all dependencies and associated timelines.
* Install and configure injectors/controller.
* Configure the test environment (ideally identical hardware to the production platform), router configuration, quiet network (we don&#x27;t want results upset by other users), deployment of server instrumentation, database test sets developed, etc.
* Dry run the tests - before actually executing the load test with predefined users, a dry run is carried out in order to check the correctness of the script.
* Execute tests – probably repeatedly (iteratively) in order to see whether any unaccounted-for factor might affect the results.
* Analyze the results - either pass/fail, or investigation of critical path and recommendation of corrective action.

== Methodology ==
=== Performance testing web applications ===
According to the Microsoft Developer Network the Performance Testing Methodology consists of the following activities:

# Identify the Test Environment. Identify the physical test environment and the production environment as well as the tools and resources available to the test team. The physical environment includes hardware, software, and network configurations. Having a thorough understanding of the entire test environment at the outset enables more efficient test design and planning and helps you identify testing challenges early in the project. In some situations, this process must be revisited periodically throughout the project&#x27;s life cycle.
# Identify Performance Acceptance Criteria. Identify the response time, throughput, and resource-use goals and constraints. In general, response time is a user concern, throughput is a business concern, and resource use is a system concern. Additionally, identify project success criteria that may not be captured by those goals and constraints; for example, using performance tests to evaluate which combination of configuration settings will result in the most desirable performance characteristics.
# Plan and Design Tests. Identify key scenarios, determine variability among representative users and how to simulate that variability, define test data, and establish metrics to be collected. Consolidate this information into one or more models of system usage to implemented, executed, and analyzed.
# Configure the Test Environment. Prepare the test environment, tools, and resources necessary to execute each strategy, as features and components become available for test. Ensure that the test environment is instrumented for resource monitoring as necessary.
# Implement the Test Design. Develop the performance tests in accordance with the test design.
# Execute the Test. Run and monitor your tests. Validate the tests, test data, and results collection. Execute validated tests for analysis while monitoring the test and the test environment.
# Analyze Results, Tune, and Retest. Analyze, consolidate, and share results data. Make a tuning change and retest. Compare the results of both tests. Each improvement made will return smaller improvement than the previous improvement. When do you stop? When you reach a CPU bottleneck, the choices then are either improve the code or add more CPU.

<doc id="39296" wikidata="Q366701" url="?curid=39296" title="Communications Decency Act">
<text>The Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA) was the United States Congress&#x27;s first notable attempt to regulate pornographic material on the Internet. In the 1997 landmark case &quot;Reno v. ACLU&quot;, the United States Supreme Court unanimously struck the act&#x27;s anti-indecency provisions.

The Act is the short name of Title V of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as specified in Section 501 of the 1996 Act. Senators James Exon and Slade Gorton introduced it to the Senate Committee of Commerce, Science, and Transportation in 1995. The amendment that became the CDA was added to the Telecommunications Act in the Senate by an 81–18 vote on June 15, 1995.

As eventually passed by Congress, Title V affected the Internet (and online communications) in two significant ways. First, it attempted to regulate both indecency (when available to children) and obscenity in cyberspace. Second, Section 230 of title 47 of the U.S. Code, part of a codification of the Communications Act of 1934 (Section 9 of the Communications Decency Act / Section 509 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996) has been interpreted to mean that operators of Internet services are not publishers (and thus not legally liable for the words of third parties who use their services).

==Anti-indecency and anti-obscenity provisions==
The act&#x27;s most controversial portions were those relating to indecency on the Internet. The relevant sections were introduced in response to fears that Internet pornography was on the rise. Indecency in TV and radio broadcasting had already been regulated by the Federal Communications Commission: broadcasting of offensive speech was restricted to hours of the day when minors were supposedly least likely to be exposed, and violators could be fined and lose their licenses. But the Internet had only recently been opened to commercial interests by the 1992 amendment to the National Science Foundation Act and thus had not been taken into consideration by previous laws. The CDA, which affected both the Internet and cable television, marked the first attempt to expand regulation to these new media.

Passed by Congress on February 1, 1996, and signed by President Bill Clinton on February 8, 1996, the CDA imposed criminal sanctions on anyone who

It further criminalized the transmission of &quot;obscene or indecent&quot; materials to persons known to be under 18.

Free speech advocates worked diligently and successfully to overturn the portion relating to indecent, but not obscene, speech. They argued that speech protected under the First Amendment, such as printed novels or the use of the &quot;seven dirty words&quot;, would suddenly become unlawful when posted online. Critics also claimed the bill would have a chilling effect on the availability of medical information. Online civil liberties organizations arranged protests against the bill, such as the Black World Wide Web protest, which encouraged webmasters to make their sites&#x27; backgrounds black for 48 hours after its passage, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation&#x27;s Blue Ribbon Online Free Speech Campaign.

===Legal challenges===
On June 12, 1996, a panel of federal judges in Philadelphia blocked part of the CDA, saying it would infringe upon adults&#x27; free speech rights. The next month, another federal court in New York struck down the portion of the CDA intended to protect children from indecent speech as too broad. On June 26, 1997, the Supreme Court upheld the Philadelphia court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union,&quot; stating that the indecency provisions were an unconstitutional abridgement of the First Amendment because they did not permit parents to decide for themselves what material was acceptable for their children, extended to non-commercial speech, and did not carefully define the words &quot;indecent&quot; and &quot;offensive&quot;. (The Court affirmed the New York case, &quot;Reno v. Shea&quot;, the next day, without a published opinion.)

In 2003, Congress amended the CDA to remove the indecency provisions struck down in &quot;Reno v. ACLU&quot;. A separate challenge to the provisions governing obscenity, known as &quot;Nitke v. Gonzales&quot;, was rejected by a federal court in New York in 2005. The Supreme Court summarily affirmed that decision in 2006.

Congress has made two narrower attempts to regulate children&#x27;s exposure to Internet indecency since the Supreme Court overturned the CDA. Court injunction blocked enforcement of the first, the Child Online Protection Act (COPA), almost immediately after its passage in 1998; the law was later overturned. While legal challenges also dogged COPA&#x27;s successor, the Children&#x27;s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) of 2000, the Supreme Court upheld it as constitutional in 2004.

==Section 230==
Section 230 of title 47 of the U.S. Code, a codification of the Communications Act of 1934 (added by Section 9 of the Communications Decency Act / Section 509 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996) was not part of the original Senate legislation, but was added in conference with the House, where it had been separately introduced by Representatives Christopher Cox and Ron Wyden as the Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment Act and passed by a near-unanimous vote on the floor. It added protection for online service providers and users from actions against them based on third-party content, stating in part, &quot;No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.&quot; Effectively, this section immunizes both ISPs and Internet users from liability for torts others commit on their websites or online forums, even if the provider fails to take action after receiving notice of the harmful or offensive content.

Through the so-called Good Samaritan provision, this section also protects ISPs from liability for restricting access to certain material or giving others the technical means to restrict access to that material.

On July 23, 2013, the attorneys general of 47 states sent Congress a letter requesting that the criminal and civil immunity in section 230 be removed. The ACLU wrote of the proposal, &quot;If Section 230 is stripped of its protections, it wouldn&#x27;t take long for the vibrant culture of free speech to disappear from the web.&quot;

===FOSTA-SESTA===

Ann Wagner introduced the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) in the U.S. House of Representatives in April 2017. Rob Portman introduced the similar Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) in the U.S. Senate in August 2017. The combined FOSTA-SESTA package passed the House on February 27, 2018, with a vote of 388–25 and the Senate on March 21, 2018, with a vote of 97–2. President Donald Trump signed the package into law on April 11, 2018.

The bill makes it illegal to knowingly assist, facilitate, or support sex trafficking, and amends the Communications Decency Act&#x27;s section 230 safe harbors (which make online services immune from civil liability for their users&#x27; actions) to exclude enforcement of federal or state sex trafficking laws from immunity. The intent is to provide serious legal consequences for websites that profit from sex trafficking and give prosecutors tools to protect their communities and give victims a pathway to justice.

The bills were criticized by pro-free speech and pro-Internet groups as a &quot;disguised internet censorship bill&quot; that weakens the section 230 safe harbors, places unnecessary burdens on internet companies and intermediaries that handle user-generated content or communications, with service providers required to proactively take action against sex trafficking activities, and requires lawyers to evaluate all possible scenarios under state and federal law (which may be financially unfeasible for smaller companies). Online sex workers argued that the bill would harm their safety, as the platforms they use to offer and discuss their services (as an alternative to street prostitution) had begun to reduce their services or shut down entirely because of the bill&#x27;s threat of liability. Since FOSTA-SESTA passed, sex workers have reported economic instability and increases in violence, as had been predicted.

==Failure-to-warn lawsuits==

In &quot;Jane Doe No. 14 v. Internet Brands, Inc.&quot;, the plaintiff filed an action alleging that Internet Brands, Inc.&#x27;s failure to warn users of its modelmayhem.com networking website caused her to be a victim of a rape scheme. On May 31, 2016, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the Communications Decency Act does not bar the plaintiff&#x27;s failure to warn claim.

<doc id="39299" wikidata="Q171957" url="?curid=39299" title="Hide-and-seek">
<text>Hide-and-seek (sometimes known as hide-and-go-seek) is a popular children&#x27;s game in which at least two players (usually at least three) conceal themselves in a set environment, to be found by one or more seekers. The game is played by one chosen player (designated as being &quot;it&quot;) counting to a predetermined number with eyes closed while the other players hide. After reaching this number, the player who is &quot;it&quot; calls &quot;Ready or not, here I come!&quot; or &quot;Coming, ready or not!&quot; and then attempts to locate all concealed players.

The game can end in one of several ways. The most common way of ending is the player chosen as &quot;it&quot; locates all players; the player found first is the loser and is chosen to be &quot;it&quot; in the next game. The player found last is the winner. Another common variation has the seeker counting at &quot;home base&quot;; the hiders can either remain hidden or they can come out of hiding to race to home base; once they touch it, they are &quot;safe&quot; and cannot be tagged.

The game is an example of an oral tradition, as it is commonly passed by children.

==Variants==
Different versions of the game are played around the world, under a variety of names.

One variant is called &quot;sardines&quot;, in which only one person hides and the others must find them, hiding with them when they do so. The hiding places become progressively more cramped, like sardines in a tin. The last person to find the hiding group is the loser, and becomes the hider for the next round. A. M. Burrage calls this version of the game &quot;Smee&quot; in his 1931 ghost story of the same name.

 In the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip by Charles Schulz, a variation of Sardines called &quot;Ha Ha Herman&quot; is played, in which the seekers call out &quot;ha ha&#x27;, and the person hiding has to respond by saying &quot;Herman&quot;. In some versions of the game, after the first hider is caught or if no other players can be found over a period of time, the seeker calls out a previously-agreed phrase (such as &quot;Olly olly oxen free&quot;, &quot;Come out, come out wherever you are&quot; or &quot;All in, All in, Everybody out there all in free&quot;) to signal the other hiders to return to base for the next round. The seeker must return to &quot;home base&quot; after finding the hiders, before the hiders get back. Conversely, the hiders must get back to &quot;home base&quot; before the seeker sees them and returns. The hiders hide until they are spotted by the seeker, who chants, &quot;Forty, forty, I see you&quot; (sometimes shortened to &quot;Forty, forty, see you&quot;). 

Once spotted, the hider must run to &quot;home base&quot; (where the seeker was counting while the other players hid) and touch it before they are &quot;tipped&quot; (tagged, or touched) by the seeker. If tagged, that hider becomes the new seeker. Forty forty has many regional names including &#x27;block one two three&#x27; in North East England and Scotland, &#x27;relievo one two three&#x27; in Wilmslow, &#x27;forty forty&#x27; in South East England, &#x27;mob&#x27; in Bristol and South Wales, &#x27;pom pom&#x27; in Norwich, &#x27;I-erkey&#x27; in Leicester, &#x27;hicky one two three&#x27; in Chester, &#x27;rally one two three&#x27; in Coventry, &#x27; Ackey 123&#x27; in Birmingham and &#x27;44 Homes&#x27; in Australia.

==History==
Whilst hide-and-seek is evidently likely a very ancient and instinctual childhood game from time immemorial, an early attested version of the game was called (&quot;apodidraskinda&quot;) in Ancient Greek. A second century Greek writer named Julius Pollux mentioned the game for the first time. Then as now, it was played the same with one player closing their eyes and counting while the other players hide. This game was also found in an early painting discovered at Herculaneum, dating back to about the second century AD.

== International competition ==
The Hide-and-Seek World Championship was an international hide-and-seek competition held from 2010 through 2017. The game is a derivative of the Italian version of hide-and-seek, &quot;nascondino&quot;.

The championship was first held in 2010 in Bergamo, Italy, as an initiative of CTRL Magazine. Though it started out as a joke, the event grew year after year. The 2016 and 2017 competitions took place in Consonno, a ghost town or &quot;The Italian Las Vegas&quot;, located in the district of Lecco, Lombardy.
The winning team was awarded &quot;The Golden Fig Leaf&quot;, which is biblically the symbol of hiding, referring to the story of Adam and Eve.

Yasuo Hazaki, a graduate of Nippon Sport Science University, and professor of media studies at Josai University in Sakado, Japan, had set up a campaign in 2013 to promote hide-and-seek for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. The game Hazaki was promoting was a slightly different traditional Japanese game, more similar to a game of tag. Hazaki contacted the Nascondino World Championship organizers and said that nascondino rules were more appropriate to be a candidate to the Olympics.

<text>Bellingham ( ) is the county seat of Whatcom County in the U.S. state of Washington. It lies south of the U.S.–Canada border, between Vancouver, British Columbia, to the northwest and Seattle to the south.

The population was 91,482 at the 2020 census, and estimated to be 94,720 in 2023. It is the site of Western Washington University, Bellingham International Airport, and the southern terminus of the Alaska Marine Highway. Bellingham is the northernmost city with a population of more than 90,000 people in the contiguous United States.

The area around Bellingham Bay, named in 1792 by George Vancouver, is the ancestral home of several Coast Salish groups. European settlement in modern-day Bellingham began in the 1850s and several coal mining towns grew in later years. The city of Bellingham was incorporated in 1903 through the consolidation of several settlements, among them Fairhaven. Local industries shifted away from coal in the mid-20th century; the industrial areas on the Bellingham waterfront have undergone redevelopment into a mixed-use neighborhood since the 2000s.

==History==

Bellingham has been inhabited by Indigenous peoples for millennia. The city of Bellingham and its surrounding area is the intersection of the territories of many Coast Salishan peoples. The Lummi, Nooksack, Samish, and Nuwhaha in particular fished in Bellingham Bay and shared the hunting and gathering grounds in the nearby forests and prairies. Indigenous people continue to live in and around Bellingham, particularly the Lummi, who have a reservation directly west of the city.

The modern city of Bellingham, incorporated in 1903, consolidated four settlements: Bellingham, Whatcom, Fairhaven, and Sehome. It takes its name from Bellingham Bay, named by George Vancouver in 1792, for Sir William Bellingham.

The first European immigrants reached the area about 1852 when Henry Roeder and Russel Peabody set up a lumber mill at Whatcom, now the northern part of Bellingham. Lumber cutting and milling continues to the present in Whatcom county. At about the same time, Dan Harris arrived, claiming a homestead along Padden Creek, and after acquiring surrounding properties, platted the town of Fairhaven in 1883. In 1858, the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush caused a short lived population growth that established the community.

Coal was mined in the Bellingham Bay area from the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries starting when Henry Roeder&#x27;s agents discovered coal south of Whatcom Creek, in an area called Sehome, now downtown Bellingham, in 1854. They sold the coal-bearing land to San Francisco investors who established the Bellingham Bay Coal Company, eventually a subsidiary of the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company. After a hundred years of extensive mining beneath present-day Bellingham, the last mine closed in 1955.

In the early 1890s, three railroad lines arrived, connecting the bay cities to a nationwide market of builders. In 1889, Pierre Cornwall and an association of investors formed the Bellingham Bay Improvement Company (BBIC). The BBIC invested in several diverse enterprises such as shipping, coal, mining, railroad construction, real estate sales and utilities. Even though their dreams of turning the cities by the bay into a Pacific Northwest metropolis never came to fruition, the BBIC made an immense contribution to the economic development of Bellingham.

BBIC was not the only outside firm with an interest in the bay area utilities. The General Electric Company of New York purchased the Fairhaven Line and New Whatcom street rail line in 1897. In 1898, the utility merged into the Northern Railway and Improvement Company which prompted the Electric Corporation of Boston to purchase a large block of shares.

In 1890, Fairhaven developers bought the tiny community of Bellingham. Whatcom and Sehome merged in 1891 to form New Whatcom (1903 act of the State legislature dropped &quot;New&quot; from the name.) At first, attempts to combine Fairhaven and Whatcom failed, and there was controversy over the name of the proposed new city. Whatcom citizens would not support a city named &quot;Fairhaven&quot;, and Fairhaven residents would not support a city named &quot;Whatcom&quot;. They eventually settled on the name &quot;Bellingham&quot;, which remains today. Voting a second time for a final merger of Fairhaven and Whatcom into a single city, the resolution passed with 2163 votes for and 596 against.

Bellingham was officially incorporated on December 28, 1903, as a result of the incremental consolidation of the four towns initially situated on the east of Bellingham Bay during the final decade of the 19th Century. Whatcom is today&#x27;s &quot;Old Town&quot; area and was founded with Roeder&#x27;s Mill in 1852. Sehome was an area of downtown founded with the Sehome Coal Mine in 1854. Bellingham was further south near Boulevard Park, founded in 1883 and purchased in 1890 by Fairhaven. Fairhaven was a large commercial district with its own harbor, founded in 1883, by Dan Harris, around his initial homestead on Padden Creek.

Bellingham was the site of the Bellingham riots against East Indian (Sikh) immigrant workers in 1907. A mob of 400–500 white men, predominantly members of the Asiatic Exclusion League, with intentions to exclude East Indian immigrants from the work force of the local lumber mills, attacked the homes of the South Asian Indians. The Indians were mostly Sikhs but were labeled as Hindus by much of the media of the day.

Bellingham&#x27;s proximity to the Strait of Juan de Fuca and to the Inside Passage to Alaska helped to retain some cannery operations. Pacific American Fisheries (P.A.F.), for example, shipped empty cans to Alaska, where they were packed with fish and shipped back.


==Geography==
The city is situated on Bellingham Bay which is protected by Lummi Island, Portage Island, and the Lummi Peninsula, and opens onto the Strait of Georgia. It lies west of Mount Baker and Lake Whatcom (from which it gets its drinking water) and north of the Chuckanut Mountains and the Skagit Valley. Whatcom Creek runs through the center of the city. Bellingham is south of the US-Canada border and southeast of Vancouver.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. The lowest elevations are at sea level along the waterfront. Alabama Hill is one of the higher points in the city at about . Elevations of are found near Yew Street Hill north of Lake Padden and near Galbraith Mountain. South and eastward of the city limits are taller foothills of the North Cascades mountains. Mount Baker is the largest peak in the local area, with a summit elevation of that is only from Bellingham Bay. Mount Baker is visible from many parts of the city and western Whatcom County. Lake Whatcom forms part of the eastern boundary of the city, while many smaller lakes and wetland areas are found around the region.

Situated at a latitude of 48.75 North, and thus north of the 48°34&#x27; parallel, Bellingham is one of only a few cities in the continental United States that experience astronomical twilight for the entire night. The phenomenon occurs every year between June 14 and 28.

Bellingham&#x27;s neighborhoods are Alabama Hill, Barkley, Birchwood, Columbia, Cordata, Cornwall Park, Downtown Central Business District, Edgemoor, Fairhaven, Happy Valley, Irongate, King Mountain, Lettered Streets, Meridian, Puget, Roosevelt, Samish, Sehome, Silver Beach, South, South Hill, Sunnyland, Whatcom Falls, Western Washington University (WWU) (including the campus), and York.

===Climate===
Bellingham&#x27;s climate is generally mild and typical of the Puget Sound region; classified as warm-summer Mediterranean (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;) or oceanic (Trewartha: &quot;Do&quot;). The city is strongly influenced by the Cascade Range and Olympic Mountains. The Cascades to the east block continental influence, while the Olympics provide a rain shadow effect that buffers Bellingham from much of the rainfall approaching from the southwest.

Bellingham receives an average annual rainfall of , which is slightly less than nearby Seattle. November is typically the wettest month, with numerous frontal rainstorms. Still, precipitation is distributed throughout the rainy period extending from October through April.

Bellingham has lowest average sunshine amount of any city in the US. Despite this, Bellingham has fewer overcast days on average than Seattle (SeaTac), Everett (Paine Field) and Olympia. The hottest summer days rarely exceed and the warmest temperature on record is on August 12, 2021. This is markedly cooler than the record high for Seattle () and most other Washington locations. Drought is rare, although some summers are noticeably drier than others and some normally reliable wells have been known to run dry in August and September. Nevertheless, crops are more frequently ruined by too much rain rather than too little.

Bellingham&#x27;s proximity to the Fraser River valley occasionally subjects it to a harsh winter weather pattern (termed a &#x27;north-Easter&#x27;) wherein an upper-level trough drives cold Arctic air from the Canadian interior southwesterly through the Fraser River Canyon. Such an event was recorded on November 28, 2006, when air temperatures of were accompanied by winds. Wind chill values reached according to NOAA. Several days into this pattern, local ponds and smaller lakes freeze solidly enough to allow skating. These outflow winds also can collide with Gulf of Alaska moisture and create ice, snow, or heavy rains; the freezing rain can create a phenomenon referred to as a &quot;silver thaw&quot; that produces hazardous roads among other inconveniences.

Its reverse, the &quot;Pineapple Express&quot;, refers to acutely mild autumn and winter spells – for most of such a spell, an unusually warm and steady wind comes out of the south. It will typically follow several days of Arctic northeast outflow winds, and it can melt significant snow accumulations quickly, pushing drainage systems to their limits.

On June 10, 1999, the Olympic pipeline explosion occurred in Whatcom Falls Park, killing three boys who were playing in the vicinity. Operated by Olympic Pipe Line Company, the pipeline that crossed Whatcom and Hanna Creeks leaked gasoline that turned the creeks pink, and then exploded into flames.

To the east of the city lies Lake Whatcom, which provides the local public water supply and is the source of Whatcom Creek.

Bellis Fair Mall, the city&#x27;s main shopping mall, opened in 1988.

===Music scene===
Bellingham&#x27;s location between two major cities, universities, record labels, and music magazines have all contributed to making Bellingham a desirable and recognized local music scene. The presence of a large university-age population has helped Bellingham become home to a number of regionally and nationally noted musical acts such as Death Cab for Cutie, Odesza, The Posies, Crayon, Idiot Pilot, Mono Men, No-Fi Soul Rebellion, Sculptured, Federation X, The Trucks, Black Eyes &amp; Neckties, Black Breath, The High Mountain String Band, Shimmertraps, Dizzy Spins, and Shook Ones.

The Bellingham Public Library provides free library services at the Central Library, Barkley Branch and Fairhaven Branch.

===Local theater===
Bellingham&#x27;s theater culture is boosted by the performing arts department at Western Washington University. There are several theaters and productions in Bellingham:

* Bellingham Theatre Guild, a non-profit community theater was founded in 1929. Hilary Swank performed here before moving to Los Angeles to pursue her career in acting.

* Northwest Ballet, a regional ballet company, performs classical ballets.
* iDiOM Theater, a non-profit regional theater: almost every show is new, locally written work.
* Firehouse Performing Arts Center, a Fairhaven firehouse converted into a dance classroom and theater.

===Activism===
The Whatcom Peace &amp; Justice Center was founded in 2002 by local activists, and has been one of the most active such centers in the nation.

In October 2006, the Bellingham City Council passed a Troops Home! resolution, making Bellingham the first city in the state of Washington to pass the resolution. Two years later, the City Council passed a resolution urging elected representatives and the federal government to avoid war with Iran, becoming the first city in the state to do so. In 2012, the City Council unanimously passed a resolution calling upon the federal government to overturn the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in the case of FEC v. Citizens United by declaring that U.S. Constitutional rights apply to natural persons and not to corporations. In 2014, coinciding with Columbus Day that celebrates the arrival of European explorers, the City Council officially established Coast Salish Day to celebrate the Native American peoples who continue to call the geographic region their home.

In 2015, the Seattle Arctic drilling protests spread to Bellingham when a protester chained herself to the anchor chain of a Royal Dutch Shell ship for 63 hours.

In May 2024, students at Western Washington University formed a pro-Palestine encampment outside of Old Main for two weeks. It disbanded on May 30 after negotiating with the university.

===Future development===
Bellingham saw apartment vacancy hit 0.6% in 2016, and plans to use multi-family housing to accommodate more than 50% of the projected growth in housing units (16,525 units by 2036). According to Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at Zillow, &quot;Given the area&#x27;s pace of growth, it would require very aggressive building to keep rent affordability in check.&quot;

The city has resisted expanding the Urban Growth Area for many years, and hopes to fit both multi-family and single-family growth within the city limits. Builders counter that even City planners acknowledge that the city is &quot;largely built out&quot; and that the remaining land is difficult or expensive to build on. Attempts to increase density, ease restrictions on &#x27;accessory dwelling units&#x27;, or even to develop land already zoned residential, are regularly met with fierce neighborhood opposition: Padden Trails was opposed by the Samish Neighborhood Association; a dense development at the Sunnyland D.O.T. site was scaled-down; Fairhaven neighbors led the effort to prevent the development of Fairhaven Highlands, (now Chuckanut Ridge), which the City ended up purchasing for $8.2 million, preventing more than 700 new housing units; neighborhood groups pressured the City Council to go against staff recommendation to rezone Squalicum Lofts for residential development.

In 2017, the Bellingham City Council began acknowledging housing affordability as a critical issue, and hosted a town hall meeting on housing affordability and homelessness.

===Waterfront redevelopment===
The Bellingham waterfront has served as an industrial center for more than a century, starting with the arrival of Henry Roeder and Russell Peabody in the mid-1800s.

Georgia-Pacific (G-P) purchased the Puget Sound Pulp and Timber Company in 1963 and operated a pulp mill on the central downtown waterfront until 2001. In 1965, G-P built a chlor-alkali facility, which became a source of mercury contamination in the Whatcom Waterway and on the uplands of the site for decades. The documentary film, &quot;Smells Like Money – The Story of Bellingham&#x27;s Georgia Pacific Plant&quot; tells the story of the site, which has since been purchased by the Port of Bellingham chiefly to create a marina in the wastewater lagoon. The Port of Bellingham purchased the G-P site for $10 with the understanding that the port would assume liability for the contamination. The City of Bellingham and the Port of Bellingham entered into several interlocal agreements in which the City agreed to pay for all infrastructure costs, and the Port would create a marina, clean up the site, and retain all zoning.

The cleanup site (approximately ) was divided into two areas: pulp and tissue mill area and the chlor-alkali area. Contaminated soils and building materials were removed in 2011 and 2013; the Department of Ecology finalized the Interim Cleanup Work Plan in January 2017, and that work was completed in April 2017 when 31 acres were capped with a protective barrier. Work continues on evaluating cleanup alternatives for the entire chlor-alkali area of the site.

The City and Port have entered into a partnership to redevelop the property, and in 2013 contracted with Harcourt Developments to develop . The Granary Building remodel will be completed in 2017; Harcourt has submitted plans for two waterfront condo buildings in 2018 and 2019; the city planned to construct two main roads through the side in 2017.

==Sports==
The people of Bellingham pursue a diverse range of amateur sports, with skiing and snowboarding at the Mount Baker Ski Area popular in the winter and kayaking and cycling in the summer. Mt. Baker claims a world record for seasonal snowfall, with recorded in the 1998–1999 season.

Western Washington University is home to NCAA Division II National Women&#x27;s Rowing Champions. The Lady Vikings became Western&#x27;s first NCAA champion team in 2005 and won again in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2017, and 2024. The 2011-2012 Western Men&#x27;s Basketball team won the NCAA Division II National Championship. In 2016, the nationally ranked Western Women&#x27;s Soccer Team won the NCAA Division II National Championship.

Western Washington University also operates a collegiate road cycling program that took top-5 positions nationwide at the 2006 nationals.

Future Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr. began his professional career with the short-season class A Bellingham Mariners of the Northwest League in 1987.

==Government==
The City of Bellingham has a non-partisan strong-mayor, weak-council form of government. The directly elected mayor serves a four-year term. Six of the seven city council members are elected by ward for staggered four-year terms. The seventh council member is elected at-large every two years.

A municipal court judge is also elected for four-year terms.

===Crime===
The city maintains Bellingham Police Department and fire department and operates the countywide Medic One medical emergency response service through an agreement with Whatcom County. According to Uniform Crime Report statistics compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 2022, there were 2 murders, 380 violent crimes and 6,517 property crimes per 100,000 residents. Of these, the violent crimes consisted of 22 forcible rapes, 135 robberies and 221 aggravated assaults, while 804 burglaries, 5,193 larceny-thefts, 500 motor vehicle thefts and 20 arson defined the property offenses.

==Education==
Bellingham School District is the local school district. There are four public high schools in Bellingham: Bellingham High School, Options High School, Sehome High School, and Squalicum High School. Bellingham has four public middle schools: Kulshan Middle School, Shuksan Middle School, Fairhaven Middle School, and Whatcom Middle School which was recently rebuilt after extensive fire damage in 2009.

Private schools in Bellingham include Whatcom Hills Waldorf School (Prekindergarten through 8th grade), Whatcom Day Academy (Prekindergarten to 8th grade), St. Paul&#x27;s Academy (Prekindergarten to 12th grade), Assumption Catholic School (Prekindergarten to 8th grade), and The Franklin Academy (Preschool to 8th grade). Western Washington University is located in Bellingham. It has more than 16,000 students. The Northwest Film School is a private, non-profit educational institution specializing in digital media production. It operates in a partnership with Western Washington University to offer a one-year certificate in Video Production.

Bellingham has two community colleges:
*Whatcom Community College
*Bellingham Technical College

Lummi Nation School has a Bellingham postal address but it is away from the city limits in an unincorporated area on the Lummi reservation.

==Media==
===Newspapers===
&quot;The Bellingham Herald&quot; is published daily in Bellingham. Other newspapers include &quot;Whatcom Watch&quot; and &quot;The Front&quot; (formerly &quot;Western Front&quot;), which covers largely affairs of Western Washington University. In 2020, the &quot;Salish Current&quot; was founded as an online, nonprofit option for regional news. &quot;The Bellingham Business Journal&quot;, also known online as &quot;BBJ Today&quot;, ceased publication in 2020. &quot;Cascadia Daily News&quot; debuted on January 24, 2022, as a daily online publication and weekly print publication, replacing &quot;Cascadia Weekly&quot;, which was available until 2021.

===Television===
Bellingham and Whatcom County are part of the Seattle television market. The area has had exceptionally early and strong penetration of cable television since the 1950s, and there have never been any local translators of the major Seattle TV stations.

Stations in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, can be viewed over the air with suitable antennae, but those in Seattle are too distant to receive in most locations in the county. Whatcom County residents can also receive CBC and CTV stations via cable service. KVOS-TV, an affiliate of the Spanish-language network Univision, is available in most parts of Bellingham with an antenna as well.

The City of Bellingham also operates BTV, a public access channel available on YouTube or Xfinity channel 10.

===Transportation===

Bellingham is bisected by Interstate 5 (I-5), which connects it to Seattle, Vancouver, and Portland, Oregon. The city also has three state highways: State Route 11, a scenic byway through the Chuckanut Mountains; State Route 539, which connects to Lynden and the Canadian border; and State Route 542, which travels east to the Mount Baker Ski Area. The city&#x27;s streets were originally named in alphabetical order from the waterfront&#x27;s never-built Army Street, increasing by one letter per block; several name changes in the early 20th century broke the naming scheme&#x27;s order.

The Bellingham International Airport offers scheduled commuter flights to and from Seattle and Friday Harbor, Washington, and regularly scheduled jet service to various West Coast airports via Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, and Southwest Airlines. Alaska Airlines and Allegiant Air used to fly to Hawaii from Bellingham, serving Honolulu, Kahului, and Kona at various times, but this service ceased by 2019. The airport is home of the first Air and Marine Operations Center, to assist the US Department of Homeland Security with border surveillance.

The Whatcom Transportation Authority (WTA) is the county&#x27;s public transit agency and operates fixed bus service within Bellingham and its neighboring cities. The agency has several hubs, including the downtown station, the Western Washington University campus, and Cordata Station near Bellis Fair Mall, which is served by BoltBus intercity express buses to Seattle and Vancouver. Several corridors have frequent service that is branded as &quot;GO Lines&quot;, with service every 15 minutes. WTA also offers intercity service to Mount Vernon, connecting with Skagit Transit for onward service to Everett.

The city&#x27;s main train station, Fairhaven Station, is served by scheduled Amtrak &quot;Cascades&quot; service to Vancouver and Seattle twice a day. Amtrak also operates one Thruway bus trip to supplement its train service on the corridor. The Bellingham Cruise Terminal is adjacent to the Amtrak station and serves as the southern terminus of the Alaska Marine Highway, a state-run ferry for passengers and vehicles. The ferries provide service to Ketchikan, Juneau, Prince Rupert, and Haines. The terminal is also served by San Juan Cruises, which provides seasonal passenger ferry service to the San Juan Islands and Friday Harbor.

<text>In art history, literature and cultural studies, Orientalism is the imitation or depiction of aspects of the Eastern world (or &quot;Orient&quot;) by writers, designers, and artists from the Western world. Orientalist painting, particularly of the Middle East, was one of the many specialties of 19th-century academic art, and Western literature was influenced by a similar interest in Oriental themes.

Since the publication of Edward Said&#x27;s &quot;Orientalism&quot; in 1978, much academic discourse has begun to use the term &#x27;Orientalism&#x27; to refer to a general patronizing Western attitude towards Middle Eastern, Asian, and North African societies. In Said&#x27;s analysis, &#x27;the West&#x27; essentializes these societies as static and undeveloped—thereby fabricating a view of Oriental culture that can be studied, depicted, and reproduced in the service of imperial power. Implicit in this fabrication, writes Said, is the idea that Western society is developed, rational, flexible, and superior. This allows &#x27;Western imagination&#x27; to see &#x27;Eastern&#x27; cultures and people as both alluring and a threat to Western civilization.

Journalist and art critic Jonathan Jones pushed back on Said&#x27;s claims, and suggested that the majority of Orientalism was derived out of a genuine fascination and admiration of Eastern cultures, not prejudice or malice.

==Background==
===Etymology===

Orientalism refers to the Orient, in reference and opposition to the Occident; the East and the West, respectively. The word Orient entered the English language as the Middle French &quot;orient&quot;. The root word &quot;oriēns&quot;, from the Latin &quot;Oriēns&quot;, has synonymous denotations: The eastern part of the world; the sky whence comes the sun; the east; the rising sun, etc.; yet the denotation changed as a term of geography.

In the &quot;Monk&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1375), Geoffrey Chaucer wrote: &quot;That they conquered many regnes grete / In the orient, with many a fair citee.&quot; The term &quot;orient&quot; refers to countries east of the Mediterranean Sea and Southern Europe. In &quot;In Place of Fear&quot; (1952), Aneurin Bevan used an expanded denotation of the Orient that comprehended East Asia: &quot;the awakening of the Orient under the impact of Western ideas.&quot; Edward Said said that Orientalism &quot;enables the political, economic, cultural and social domination of the West, not just during colonial times, but also in the present.&quot;

===Art===

In art history, the term &quot;Orientalism&quot; refers to the works of mostly 19th-century Western artists who specialized in Oriental subjects, produced from their travels in Western Asia, during the 19th century. At that time, artists and scholars were described as Orientalists, especially in France, where the dismissive use of the term &quot;Orientalist&quot; was made popular by the art critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary. Despite such social disdain for a style of representational art, the French Society of Orientalist Painters was founded in 1893, with Jean-Léon Gérôme as the honorary president; whereas in Britain, the term Orientalist identified &quot;an artist&quot;.

The formation of the French Orientalist Painters Society changed the consciousness of practitioners towards the end of the 19th century, since artists could now see themselves as part of a distinct art movement. As an art movement, Orientalist painting is generally treated as one of the many branches of 19th-century academic art; however, many different styles of Orientalist art were in evidence. Art historians tend to identify two broad types of Orientalist artist: the realists who carefully painted what they observed such as Gustav Bauernfeint; and those who &quot;imagined&quot; Orientalist scenes without ever leaving the studio. French painters such as Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863) and Jean-Léon Gérôme (1824–1904) are widely regarded as the leading luminaries of the Orientalist movement.

===Oriental studies===
In the late 18th century, 19th century and early 20th century, the term Orientalist identified a scholar who specialized in the languages and literatures of the Eastern world. Among such scholars were officials of the East India Company, who said that the Arab culture, the Indian culture, and the Islamic cultures should be studied as equal to the cultures of Europe. Among such scholars is the philologist William Jones, whose studies of Indo-European languages established modern philology. Company rule in India favored Orientalism as a technique for developing and maintaining positive relations with the Indians—until the 1820s, when the influence of &quot;anglicists&quot; such as Thomas Babington Macaulay and John Stuart Mill led to the promotion of a Western-style education.

Additionally, Hebraism and Jewish studies gained popularity among British and German scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries. The academic field of Oriental studies, which comprehended the cultures of the Near East and the Far East, became the fields of Asian studies and Middle Eastern studies.

===Critical studies===

====Edward Said====

In his book &quot;Orientalism&quot; (1978), cultural critic Edward Said redefines the term &quot;Orientalism&quot; to describe a pervasive Western tradition—academic and artistic—of prejudiced outsider-interpretations of the Eastern world, which was shaped by the cultural attitudes of European imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries. The thesis of &quot;Orientalism&quot; develops Antonio Gramsci&#x27;s theory of cultural hegemony, and Michel Foucault&#x27;s theorisation of discourse (the knowledge-power relation) to criticise the scholarly tradition of Oriental studies. Said criticised contemporary scholars who perpetuated the tradition of outsider-interpretation of Arabo-Islamic cultures, especially Bernard Lewis and Fouad Ajami. Furthermore, Said said that &quot;The idea of representation is a theatrical one: the Orient is the stage on which the whole East is confined&quot;, and that the subject of learned Orientalists &quot;is not so much the East itself as the East made known, and therefore less fearsome, to the Western reading public&quot;.

In the academy, the book &quot;Orientalism&quot; (1978) became a foundational text of post-colonial cultural studies. The analyses in Said&#x27;s works are of Orientalism in European literature, especially French literature, and do not analyse visual art and Orientalist painting. In that vein, the art historian Linda Nochlin applied Said&#x27;s methods of critical analysis to art, &quot;with uneven results&quot;. Other scholars see Orientalist paintings as depicting a myth and a fantasy that did not often correlate with reality.

==== Islamic world ====
There is also a critical trend within the Islamic world. In 2002, it was estimated that in Saudi Arabia alone some 200 books and 2,000 articles discussing Orientalism had been penned by local or foreign scholars.

==In European architecture and design==
The Moresque style of Renaissance ornament is a European adaptation of the Islamic arabesque that began in the late 15th century and was to be used in some types of work, such as bookbinding, until almost the present day. Early architectural use of motifs lifted from the Indian subcontinent is known as Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture. One of the earliest examples is the façade of Guildhall, London (1788–1789). The style gained momentum in the west with the publication of views of India by William Hodges, and William and Thomas Daniell from about 1795. Examples of &quot;Hindoo&quot; architecture are Sezincote House () in Gloucestershire, built for a nabob returned from Bengal, and the Royal Pavilion in Brighton.

&quot;Turquerie&quot;, which began as early as the late 15th century, continued until at least the 18th century, and included both the use of &quot;Turkish&quot; styles in the decorative arts, the adoption of Turkish costume at times, and interest in art depicting the Ottoman Empire itself. Venice, the traditional trading partner of the Ottomans, was the earliest centre, with France becoming more prominent in the 18th century.

&quot;Chinoiserie&quot; is the catch-all term for the fashion for Chinese themes in decoration in Western Europe, beginning in the late 17th century and peaking in waves, especially Rococo Chinoiserie, &quot;c.&quot; 1740–1770. From the Renaissance to the 18th century, Western designers attempted to imitate the technical sophistication of Chinese ceramics with only partial success. Early hints of Chinoiserie appeared in the 17th century in nations with active East India companies: England (the East India Company), Denmark (the Danish East India Company), the Netherlands (the Dutch East India Company) and France (the French East India Company). Tin-glazed pottery made at Delft and other Dutch towns adopted genuine Ming-era blue and white porcelain from the early 17th century. Early ceramic wares made at Meissen and other centers of true porcelain imitated Chinese shapes for dishes, vases and teawares (see Chinese export porcelain).

Pleasure pavilions in &quot;Chinese taste&quot; appeared in the formal parterres of late Baroque and Rococo German palaces, and in tile panels at Aranjuez near Madrid. Thomas Chippendale&#x27;s mahogany tea tables and china cabinets, especially, were embellished with fretwork glazing and railings, &quot;c.&quot; 1753–1770. Sober &quot;homages&quot; to early Xing scholars&#x27; furnishings were also naturalized, as the &quot;tang&quot; evolved into a mid-Georgian side table and squared slat-back armchairs that suited English gentlemen as well as Chinese scholars. Not every adaptation of Chinese design principles falls within mainstream &quot;chinoiserie&quot;. Chinoiserie media included imitations of lacquer and painted tin (&quot;tôle&quot;) ware that imitated japanning, early painted wallpapers in sheets, and ceramic figurines and table ornaments. Small pagodas appeared on chimneypieces and full-sized ones in gardens. Kew has a magnificent Great Pagoda designed by William Chambers. The Wilhelma (1846) in Stuttgart is an example of Moorish Revival architecture. Leighton House, built for the artist Frederic Leighton, has a conventional facade but elaborate Arab-style interiors, including original Islamic tiles and other elements as well as Victorian Orientalizing work.

After 1860, &quot;Japonism,&quot; sparked by the importing of ukiyo-e, became an important influence in the western arts. In particular, many modern French artists such as Claude Monet and Edgar Degas were influenced by the Japanese style. Mary Cassatt, an American artist who worked in France, used elements of combined patterns, flat planes and shifting perspective of Japanese prints in her own images. The paintings of James Abbott McNeill Whistler&#x27;s &quot;The Peacock Room&quot; demonstrated how he used aspects of Japanese tradition and are some of the finest works of the genre. California architects Greene and Greene were inspired by Japanese elements in their design of the Gamble House and other buildings.

Egyptian Revival architecture became popular in the early and mid-19th century and continued as a minor style into the early 20th century. Moorish Revival architecture began in the early 19th century in the German states and was particularly popular for building synagogues. Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture was a genre that arose in the late 19th century in the British Raj.

==Orientalist art==

Orientalist tendencies in Western art have a long history. Oriental scenes may be found in medieval and Renaissance art, and Islamic art has itself had a profound and formative influence on Western artistic output. Oriental subject matter further proliferated in the 19th century, in step with Western colonialism in Africa and Asia.

===Pre-19th century===

Depictions of Islamic &quot;Moors&quot; and &quot;Turks&quot; (imprecisely named Muslim groups of southern Europe, North Africa and West Asia) can be found in Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque art. In Biblical scenes in Early Netherlandish painting, secondary figures, especially Romans, were given exotic costumes that distantly reflected the clothes of the Near East. The Three Magi in Nativity scenes were an especial focus for this. In general art with Biblical settings would not be considered as Orientalist except where contemporary or historicist Middle Eastern detail or settings is a feature of works, as with some paintings by Gentile Bellini and others, and a number of 19th-century works. Renaissance Venice had a phase of particular interest in depictions of the Ottoman Empire in painting and prints. Gentile Bellini, who travelled to Constantinople and painted the Sultan, and Vittore Carpaccio were the leading painters. By then the depictions were more accurate, with men typically dressed all in white. The depiction of Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting sometimes draws from Orientalist interest, but more often just reflects the prestige these expensive objects had in the period.

Jean-Étienne Liotard (1702–1789) visited Istanbul and painted numerous pastels of Turkish domestic scenes; he also continued to wear Turkish attire for much of the time when he was back in Europe. The ambitious Scottish 18th-century artist Gavin Hamilton found a solution to the problem of using modern dress, considered unheroic and inelegant, in history painting by using Middle Eastern settings with Europeans wearing local costume, as travelers were advised to do. His huge &quot;James Dawkins and Robert Wood Discovering the Ruins of Palmyra&quot; (1758, now Edinburgh) elevates tourism to the heroic, with the two travelers wearing what look very like togas. Many travelers had themselves painted in exotic Eastern dress on their return, including Lord Byron, as did many who had never left Europe, including Madame de Pompadour. The growing French interest in exotic Oriental luxury and lack of liberty in the 18th century to some extent reflected a pointed analogy with France&#x27;s own absolute monarchy. Byron&#x27;s poetry was highly influential in introducing Europe to the heady cocktail of Romanticism in exotic Oriental settings which was to dominate 19th century Oriental art.

===French Orientalism===

French Orientalist painting was transformed by Napoleon&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful invasion of Egypt and Syria in 1798–1801, which stimulated great public interest in Egyptology, and was also recorded in subsequent years by Napoleon&#x27;s court painters, especially Antoine-Jean Gros, although the Middle Eastern campaign was not one on which he accompanied the army. Two of his most successful paintings, &quot;Bonaparte Visiting the Plague Victims of Jaffa&quot; (1804) and &quot;Battle of Abukir&quot; (1806) focus on the Emperor, as he was by then, but include many Egyptian figures, as does the less effective &quot;Napoleon at the Battle of the Pyramids&quot; (1810). Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson&#x27;s &quot;The Revolt of Cairo&quot; (1810) was another large and prominent example. A well-illustrated &quot;Description de l&#x27;Égypte&quot; was published by the French Government in twenty volumes between 1809 and 1828, concentrating on antiquities.

Eugène Delacroix&#x27;s first great success, &quot;The Massacre at Chios&quot; (1824) was painted before he visited Greece or the East, and followed his friend Théodore Géricault&#x27;s &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; in showing a recent incident in distant parts that had aroused public opinion. Greece was still fighting for independence from the Ottomans, and was effectively as exotic as the more Near Eastern parts of the empire. Delacroix followed up with &quot;Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi&quot; (1827), commemorating a siege of the previous year, and &quot;The Death of Sardanapalus&quot;, inspired by Lord Byron, which although set in antiquity has been credited with beginning the mixture of sex, violence, lassitude and exoticism which runs through much French Orientalist painting. In 1832, Delacroix finally visited what is now Algeria, recently conquered by the French, and Morocco, as part of a diplomatic mission to the Sultan of Morocco. He was greatly struck by what he saw, comparing the North African way of life to that of the Ancient Romans, and continued to paint subjects from his trip on his return to France. Like many later Orientalist painters, he was frustrated by the difficulty of sketching women, and many of his scenes featured Jews or warriors on horses. However, he was apparently able to get into the women&#x27;s quarters or harem of a house to sketch what became &quot;Women of Algiers&quot;; few later harem scenes had this claim to authenticity.

When Ingres, the director of the French &quot;Académie de peinture&quot;, painted a highly colored vision of a &quot;hammam&quot;, he made his eroticized Orient publicly acceptable by his diffuse generalizing of the female forms (who might all have been the same model). More open sensuality was seen as acceptable in the exotic Orient. This imagery persisted in art into the early 20th century, as evidenced in Henri Matisse&#x27;s orientalist semi-nudes from his Nice period, and his use of Oriental costumes and patterns. Ingres&#x27; pupil Théodore Chassériau (1819–1856) had already achieved success with his nude &quot;The Toilette of Esther&quot; (1841, Louvre) and equestrian portrait of &quot;Ali-Ben-Hamet, Caliph of Constantine and Chief of the Haractas, Followed by his Escort&quot; (1846) before he first visited the East, but in later decades the steamship made travel much easier and increasing numbers of artists traveled to the Middle East and beyond, painting a wide range of Oriental scenes.

In many of these works, artists portrayed the Orient as exotic, colorful and sensual, not to say stereotyped. Such works typically concentrated on Arab, Jewish, and other Semitic cultures, as those were the ones visited by artists as France became more engaged in North Africa. French artists such as Eugène Delacroix, Jean-Léon Gérôme and Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres painted many works depicting Islamic culture, often including lounging odalisques. They stressed both lassitude and visual spectacle. Other scenes, especially in genre painting, have been seen as either closely comparable to their equivalents set in modern-day or historical Europe, or as also reflecting an Orientalist mind-set in the Saidian sense of the term. Gérôme was the precursor, and often the master, of a number of French painters in the later part of the century whose works were often frankly salacious, frequently featuring scenes in harems, public baths and slave auctions (the last two also available with classical decor), and responsible, with others, for &quot;the equation of Orientalism with the nude in pornographic mode&quot;; (&quot;Gallery, below&quot;)

Orientalist sculptors include Charles Cordier.

===British Orientalism===

Though British political interest in the territories of the unravelling Ottoman Empire was as intense as in France, it was mostly more discreetly exercised. The origins of British Orientalist 19th-century painting owe more to religion than military conquest or the search for plausible locations for nude women. The leading British genre painter, Sir David Wilkie was 55 when he travelled to Istanbul and Jerusalem in 1840, dying off Gibraltar during the return voyage. Though not noted as a religious painter, Wilkie made the trip with a Protestant agenda to reform religious painting, as he believed that: &quot;a Martin Luther in painting is as much called for as in theology, to sweep away the abuses by which our divine pursuit is encumbered&quot;, by which he meant traditional Christian iconography. He hoped to find more authentic settings and decor for Biblical subjects at their original location, though his death prevented more than studies being made. Other artists including the Pre-Raphaelite William Holman Hunt and David Roberts (in &quot;The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia&quot;) had similar motivations, giving an emphasis on realism in British Orientalist art from the start. The French artist James Tissot also used contemporary Middle Eastern landscape and decor for Biblical subjects, with little regard for historical costumes or other fittings.

William Holman Hunt produced a number of major paintings of Biblical subjects drawing on his Middle Eastern travels, improvising variants of contemporary Arab costume and furnishings to avoid specifically Islamic styles, and also some landscapes and genre subjects. The biblical subjects included &quot;The Scapegoat&quot; (1856), &quot;The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple&quot; (1860), and &quot;The Shadow of Death&quot; (1871). &quot;The Miracle of the Holy Fire&quot; (1899) was intended as a picturesque satire on the local Eastern Christians, of whom, like most European visitors, Hunt took a very dim view. His &quot;A Street Scene in Cairo; The Lantern-Maker&#x27;s Courtship&quot; (1854–61) is a rare contemporary narrative scene, as the young man feels his fiancé&#x27;s face, which he is not allowed to see, through her veil, as a Westerner in the background beats his way up the street with his stick. This a rare intrusion of a clearly contemporary figure into an Orientalist scene; mostly they claim the picturesqueness of the historical painting so popular at the time, without the trouble of researching authentic costumes and settings.

When Gérôme exhibited &quot;For Sale; Slaves at Cairo&quot; at the Royal Academy in London in 1871, it was &quot;widely found offensive&quot;, partly because the British involvement in successfully suppressed the slave trade in Egypt, but also for cruelty and &quot;representing fleshiness for its own sake&quot;. But Rana Kabbani believes that &quot;French Orientalist painting, as exemplified by the works of Gérôme, may appear more sensual, gaudy, gory and sexually explicit than its British counterpart, but this is a difference of style not substance ... Similar strains of fascination and repulsion convulsed their artists&quot; Nonetheless, nudity and violence are more evident in British paintings set in the ancient world, and &quot;the iconography of the &quot;odalisque&quot; ... the Oriental sex slave whose image is offered up to the viewer as freely as she herself supposedly was to her master – is almost entirely French in origin&quot;, though taken up with enthusiasm by Italian and other European painters.

John Frederick Lewis, who lived for several years in a traditional mansion in Cairo, painted highly detailed works showing both realistic genre scenes of Middle Eastern life and more idealized scenes in upper class Egyptian interiors with no traces of Western cultural influence yet apparent. His careful and seemingly affectionate representation of Islamic architecture, furnishings, screens, and costumes set new standards of realism, which influenced other artists, including Gérôme in his later works. He &quot;never painted a nude&quot;, and his wife modelled for several of his harem scenes, which, with the rare examples by the classicist painter Lord Leighton, imagine &quot;the harem as a place of almost English domesticity, ... [where]... women&#x27;s fully clothed respectability suggests a moral healthiness to go with their natural good looks&quot;.

Other artists concentrated on landscape painting, often of desert scenes, including Richard Dadd and Edward Lear. David Roberts (1796–1864) produced architectural and landscape views, many of antiquities, and published very successful books of lithographs from them.

===Russian Orientalism===

Russian Orientalist art was largely concerned with the areas of Central Asia that Russia was conquering during the century, and also in historical painting with the Mongols who had dominated Russia for much of the Middle Ages, who were rarely shown in a good light. The explorer Nikolai Przhevalsky played a major role in popularising an exotic view of &quot;the Orient&quot; and advocating imperial expansion.

&quot;The Five&quot; Russian composers were prominent 19th-century Russian composers who worked together to create a distinct national style of classical music. One hallmark of &quot;The Five&quot; composers was their reliance on orientalism. Many quintessentially &quot;Russian&quot; works were composed in orientalist style, such as Balakirev&#x27;s &quot;Islamey&quot;, Borodin&#x27;s &quot;Prince Igor&quot; and Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Scheherazade&quot;. As leader of &quot;The Five&quot;, Balakirev encouraged the use of eastern themes and harmonies to set their &quot;Russian&quot; music apart from the German symphonism of Anton Rubinstein and other Western-oriented composers.

=== German Orientalism ===
Edward Said originally wrote that Germany did not have a politically motivated Orientalism because its colonial empire did not expand in the same areas as France and Britain. Said later stated that Germany &quot;had in common with Anglo-French and later American Orientalism [...] a kind of intellectual authority over the Orient&quot;. However, Said also wrote that &quot;there was nothing in Germany to correspond to the Anglo-French presence in India, the Levant, North Africa. Moreover, the German Orient was almost exclusively a scholarly, or at least a classical, Orient: it was made the subject of lyrics, fantasies, and even novels, but it was never actual.&quot; According to Suzanne L. Marchand, German scholars were the &quot;pace-setters&quot; in oriental studies. Robert Irwin wrote that &quot;until the outbreak of the Second World War, German dominance of Orientalism was practically unchallenged.&quot;

=== Elsewhere ===

Nationalist historical painting in Central Europe and the Balkans dwelt on oppression during the Ottoman Empire period, battles between Ottoman and Christian armies, as well as themes like the Ottoman Imperial Harem, although the latter was a less common theme than in French depictions.

The Saidian analysis has not prevented a strong revival of interest in, and collecting of, 19th century Orientalist works since the 1970s, the latter was in large part led by Middle Eastern buyers.

==Pop culture==
Authors and composers are not commonly referred to as &quot;Orientalist&quot; in the way that artists are, and relatively few specialized in Oriental topics or styles, or are even best known for their works including them. But many major figures, from Mozart to Flaubert, have produced significant works with Oriental subjects or treatments. Lord Byron with his four long &quot;Turkish tales&quot; in poetry, is one of the most important writers to make exotic fantasy Oriental settings a significant theme in the literature of Romanticism. Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Aida&quot; (1871) is set in Egypt as portrayed through the content and the visual spectacle. &quot;Aida&quot; depicts a militaristic Egypt&#x27;s tyranny over Ethiopia.

Irish Orientalism had a particular character, drawing on various beliefs about early historical links between Ireland and the East, few of which are now regarded as historically correct. The mythical Milesians are one example of this. The Irish were also conscious of the views of other nations seeing them as comparably backward to the East, and Europe&#x27;s &quot;backyard Orient.&quot;

===In music===
In music, Orientalism may be applied to styles occurring in different periods, such as the &quot;alla Turca&quot;, used by multiple composers including Mozart and Beethoven. The musicologist Richard Taruskin identified in 19th-century Russian music a strain of Orientalism: &quot;the East as a sign or metaphor, as imaginary geography, as historical fiction, as the reduced and totalized other against which we construct our (not less reduced and totalized) sense of ourselves.&quot; Taruskin conceded Russian composers, unlike those in France and Germany, felt an &quot;ambivalence&quot; to the theme since &quot;Russia was a contiguous empire in which Europeans, living side by side with &#x27;orientals&#x27;, identified (and intermarried) with them far more than in the case of other colonial powers&quot;.

Nonetheless, Taruskin characterized Orientalism in Romantic Russian music as having melodies &quot;full of close little ornaments and melismas&quot;, chromatic accompanying lines, drone bass—characteristics which were used by Glinka, Balakirev, Borodin, Rimsky-Korsakov, Lyapunov, and Rachmaninov. These musical characteristics evoke:not just the East, but the seductive East that emasculates, enslaves, renders passive. In a word, it signifies the promise of the experience of &quot;nega&quot;, a prime attribute of the orient as imagined by the Russians... In opera and song, &quot;nega&quot; often simply denotes S-E-X a la russe, desired or achieved.Orientalism is also traceable in music that is considered to have effects of exoticism, including the influence of Javanese gamelan in Claude Debussy&#x27;s piano music all the way to the sitar being used in recordings by the Beatles.

In the United Kingdom, Gustav Holst composed &quot;Beni Mora&quot; evoking a languid, heady Arabian atmosphere.

Orientalism, in a more &quot;camp&quot; fashion also found its way into exotica music in the late 1950s, especially the works of Les Baxter, for example, his composition &quot;City of Veils&quot;.

===In literature===

The Romantic movement in literature began in 1785 and ended around 1830. The term &quot;Romantic&quot; references the ideas and culture that writers of the time reflected in their work. During this time, the culture and objects of the East began to have a profound effect on Europe. Extensive traveling by artists and members of the European elite brought travelogues and sensational tales back to the West creating a great interest in all things &quot;foreign&quot;. Romantic Orientalism incorporates African and Asian geographic locations, well-known colonial and &quot;native&quot; personalities, folklore, and philosophies to create a literary environment of colonial exploration from a distinctly European worldview. The current trend in analysis of this movement references a belief in this literature as a mode to justify European colonial endeavors with the expansion of territory.

In his novel &quot;Salammbô&quot;, Gustave Flaubert used ancient Carthage in North Africa as a foil to ancient Rome. He portrayed its culture as morally corrupting and suffused with dangerously alluring eroticism. This novel proved hugely influential on later portrayals of ancient Semitic cultures.

===In film===

Said argues that the continuity of Orientalism into the present can be found in influential images, particularly through the Cinema of the United States, as the West has now grown to include the United States. Many blockbuster feature films, such as the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; series, &quot;The Mummy&quot; films, and Disney&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin&quot; film series demonstrate the imagined geographies of the East. The films usually portray the lead heroic characters as being from the Western world, while the villains often come from the East. The representation of the Orient has continued in film, although this representation does not necessarily have any truth to it.
In &quot;The Tea House of the August Moon&quot; (1956), as argued by Pedro Iacobelli, there are tropes of orientalism. He notes, that the film &quot;tells us more about the Americans and the American&#x27;s image of Okinawa rather than about the Okinawan people.&quot; The film characterizes the Okinawans as &quot;merry but backward&quot; and &quot;de-politicized&quot;, which ignored the real-life Okinawan political protests over forceful land acquisition by the American military at the time.

Kimiko Akita, in &quot;Orientalism and the Binary of Fact and Fiction in &#x27;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;&#x27;, argues that &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; (2005) contains orientalist tropes and deep &quot;cultural misrepresentations&quot;. She states that &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; &quot;reinforces the idea of Japanese culture and geisha as exotic, backward, irrational, dirty, profane, promiscuous, bizarre, and enigmatic.&quot;

===In dance===
During the Romantic period of the 19th century, ballet developed a preoccupation with the exotic. This exoticism ranged from ballets set in Scotland to those based on ethereal creatures. By the later part of the century, ballets were capturing the presumed essence of the mysterious East. These ballets often included sexual themes and tended to be based on assumptions of people rather than on concrete facts. Orientalism is apparent in numerous ballets.

The Orient motivated several major ballets, which have survived since the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. &quot;Le Corsaire&quot; premiered in 1856 at the Paris Opera, with choreography by Joseph Mazilier. Marius Petipa re-choreographed the ballet for the Maryinsky Ballet in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1899. Its complex storyline, loosely based on Lord Byron&#x27;s poem, takes place in Turkey and focuses on a love story between a pirate and a beautiful slave girl. Scenes include a bazaar where women are sold to men as slaves, and the Pasha&#x27;s Palace, which features his harem of wives. In 1877, Marius Petipa choreographed &quot;La Bayadère&quot;, the love story of an Indian temple dancer and Indian warrior. This ballet was based on Kalidasa&#x27;s play &quot;Sakuntala&quot;. &quot;La Bayadere&quot; used vaguely Indian costuming, and incorporated Indian inspired hand gestures into classical ballet. In addition, it included a &#x27;Hindu Dance,&#x27; motivated by Kathak, an Indian dance form. Another ballet, &quot;Sheherazade&quot;, choreographed by Michel Fokine in 1910 to music by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, is a story involving a shah&#x27;s wife and her illicit relations with a Golden Slave, originally played by Vaslav Nijinsky. The ballet&#x27;s controversial fixation on sex includes an orgy in an oriental harem. When the shah discovers the actions of his numerous wives and their lovers, he orders the deaths of those involved. &quot;Sheherazade&quot; was loosely based on folktales of questionable authenticity.

Several lesser-known ballets of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century also show their Orientalism. For instance, in Petipa&#x27;s &quot;The Pharaoh&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1862), an Englishman imagines himself, in an opium-induced dream, as an Egyptian boy who wins the love of the Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter, Aspicia. Aspicia&#x27;s costume consisted of &#x27;Egyptian&#x27; décor on a tutu. Another ballet, Hippolyte Monplaisir&#x27;s &quot;Brahma&quot;, which premiered in 1868 in La Scala, Italy, is a story that involves romantic relations between a slave girl and Brahma, the Hindu god, when he visits earth. In addition, in 1909, Serge Diagilev included &quot;Cléopâtre&quot; in the Ballets Russes&#x27; repertory. With its theme of sex, this revision of Fokine&#x27;s &quot;Une Nuit d&#x27;Egypte&quot; combined the &quot;exoticism and grandeur&quot; that audiences of this time craved.

As one of the pioneers of modern dance in America, Ruth St Denis also explored Orientalism in her dancing. Her dances were not authentic; she drew inspiration from photographs, books, and later from museums in Europe. Yet, the exoticism of her dances catered to the interests of society women in America. She included &quot;Radha&quot; and &quot;The Cobras&quot; in her &#x27;Indian&#x27; program in 1906. In addition, she found success in Europe with another Indian-themed ballet, &quot;The Nautch&quot; in 1908. In 1909, upon her return to America, St Denis created her first &#x27;Egyptian&#x27; work, &quot;Egypta&quot;. Her preference for Orientalism continued, culminating with &quot;Ishtar of the Seven Gates&quot; in 1923, about a Babylonian goddess.

While Orientalism in dance climaxed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it is still present in modern times. For instance, major ballet companies regularly perform &quot;Le Corsaire&quot;, &quot;La Bayadere&quot;, and &quot;Sheherazade&quot;. Furthermore, Orientalism is also found within newer versions of ballets. In versions of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, such as the 2010 American Ballet Theatre production, the Chinese dance uses an arm position with the arms bent at a ninety-degree angle and the index fingers pointed upwards, while the Arabian dance uses two dimensional bent arm movements. Inspired by ballets of the past, stereotypical &#x27;Oriental&#x27; movements and arm positions have developed and remain.

==Religion==

An exchange of Western and Eastern ideas about spirituality developed as the West traded with and established colonies in Asia. The first Western translation of a Sanskrit text appeared in 1785, marking the growing interest in Indian culture and languages. Translations of the &quot;Upanishads&quot;, which Arthur Schopenhauer called &quot;the consolation of my life&quot;, first appeared in 1801 and 1802. Early translations also appeared in other European languages. 19th-century transcendentalism was influenced by Asian spirituality, prompting Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882) to pioneer the idea of spirituality as a distinct field.

A major force in the mutual influence of Eastern and Western spirituality and religiosity was the Theosophical Society, a group searching for ancient wisdom from the East and spreading Eastern religious ideas in the West. One of its salient features was the belief in &quot;Masters of Wisdom&quot;, &quot;beings, human or once human, who have transcended the normal frontiers of knowledge, and who make their wisdom available to others&quot;. The Theosophical Society also spread Western ideas in the East, contributing to its modernisation and a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies.

The Theosophical Society had a major influence on Buddhist modernism and Hindu reform movements. Between 1878 and 1882, the Society and the Arya Samaj were united as the Theosophical Society of the Arya Samaj. Helena Blavatsky, along with H. S. Olcott and Anagarika Dharmapala, was instrumental in the Western transmission and revival of Theravada Buddhism.

Another major influence was Vivekananda, who popularised his modernised interpretation of Advaita Vedanta during the later 19th and early 20th century in both India and the West, emphasising &quot;anubhava&quot; (&quot;personal experience&quot;) over scriptural authority.

=== Islam ===
With the spread of Eastern religious and cultural ideals towards the West, came in with studies and certain illustrations that depicts certain regions and religions under the Western perspective. Many the aspects or views are often turned into the ideas that the West have adopted onto those cultural and religious ideals. One of the more adopted views can be depicted through Western context on Islam and the Middle East. Under the adopted view of Islam under the Western context, Orientalism falls under the category of the Western perspective of thinking that shifts through social constructs that refers towards representations of the religion or culture in a subjective view point. The concept of Orientalism dates back to precolonial eras, as the main European powers acquired and perceived of territory, resources, knowledge, and control of the regions in the East. The term Orientalism, depicts further into the historical context of antagonism and misrepresentation into the tendencies of a growing layer of Western inclusion and influence on foreign culture and ideals.

In the religious perspective under Islam, the term Orientalism applies in similar meaning as the outlook from the Western perspective, mainly in the eyes of the Christian majority. The main contributor of the depiction of Oriental perspectives or illustrations on Islam and other Middle Eastern cultures derives from the imperial and colonial influences and powers that attribute to formation of multiple fields of geographical, political, educational, and scientific elements. The combination of these different genres reveal significant division among people of those cultures and reinforces the ideals set from the Western perspective. With Islam, historically scientific discoveries, research, inventions, or ideas that were presented before and contributed to many other European breakthroughs are not affiliated with the previous Islamic scientists. From the exclusion of past contributions and initial works further lead to narrative of the concept of Orientalism with the passing of time generated a history and directive of presence within region and religion that historically influences the image of the East.

Through the recent years, Orientalism has been influenced and shifted to altering representations of various forms that all derive from the same meaning. From the nineteenth century, among the Western perspectives on Orientalism, differed as the split of American and European Orientalism viewed different illustrations. With mainstream media and popular production reveal many depictions of Oriental cultures and Islamic references to the current event of radicalization for Non-western cultures. With references and mainstream media often utilized to contribute to an extended agenda under the construct judgement of alternate motives. The approach with the generalization of the term Orientalism was embedded with under beginning of colonialism as the root of the main complexity of within modern societies perspectives of foreign cultures. As mainstream media depicts illustrations to utilize many instances of discourse and on certain regions mainly among the conflict within regions in the Middle East and Africa. With agenda of influencing views on non-western societies to be deemed non-compatible with differing ideologies and cultures, the elements that present diversion among Eastern societies and aspects.

==Eastern views of the West and Western views of the East==
The concept of &quot;Orientalism&quot; has been adopted by scholars in East-Central and Eastern Europe, among them Maria Todorova, Attila Melegh, Tomasz Zarycki, and Dariusz Skórczewski as an analytical tool for exploring the images of East-Central and Eastern European societies in cultural discourses of the West in the 19th century and during the Soviet domination.

The term &quot;re-orientalism&quot; was used by Lisa Lau and Ana Cristina Mendes to refer to how Eastern self-representation is based on western referential points:Re-Orientalism differs from Orientalism in its manner of and reasons for referencing the West: while challenging the metanarratives of Orientalism, re-Orientalism sets up alternative metanarratives of its own in order to articulate eastern identities, simultaneously deconstructing and reinforcing Orientalism.

=== Occidentalism ===

The term &quot;occidentalism&quot; is often used to refer to negative views of the Western world found in Eastern societies, and is founded on the sense of nationalism that spread in reaction to colonialism (see Pan-Asianism). Edward Said has been accused of Occidentalizing the west in his critique of Orientalism; of falsely characterizing the West in the same way that he states that Western scholars have falsely characterized the East. According to this viewpoint, Said essentialized the West by creating a homogenous image of the area.

Eighteenth century Qing emperors in China had a material fascination with &quot;Occidenterie&quot;, or objects inspired by Western art and architecture (an analogue to Europe&#x27;s chinoiserie or material imitation of Chinese artistic traditions). Although the phenomenon was strongly associated with the emperor&#x27;s court and the architecture project of Xiyang Lou, nonetheless, a wide spectrum of China&#x27;s social classes had some access to &quot;Occidenterie&quot; objects as they were domestically produced.

=== Othering ===
The action of &quot;othering&quot; cultures occurs when groups are labeled as different due to characteristics that distinguish them from the perceived norm. Edward Said, author of the book &quot;Orientalism&quot;, argued that western powers and influential individuals such as social scientists and artists othered &quot;the Orient&quot;. The evolution of ideologies is often initially embedded in the language, and continues to ripple through the fabric of society by taking over the culture, economy and political sphere. Much of Said&#x27;s criticism of Western Orientalism is based on what he describes as articularizing trends. These ideologies are present in Asian works by Indian, Chinese, and Japanese writers and artists, in their views of Western culture and tradition. A particularly significant development is the manner in which Orientalism has taken shape in non-Western cinema, as for instance in Hindi-language cinema.

Said&#x27;s Orientalism has been instrumental to the critical turn in the humanities and the social sciences concerning the appreciation of the political weight of &quot;representing&quot; as a form of powering over Others. However, as recent anthropological enquiries suggest, Orientalism has also been at times simplistically applied to merely equate Othering with the attribution of negative qualities.
A study of the sphere of Othering in contexts, seemingly removed from Said&#x27;s original focus, such as the relationship between Greece and Germany during the sovereign debt crisis years may point to volatile ingredients in the Othering process, including fascination mixed with condescension, aversion, admiration and hopes for an escape from an oppressive northern European lifestyle. Similarly, tourism and intra-national relations between urban centers and rural peripheries are spheres where Orientalist dynamics (Othering) are at a play, even if, as noted above, these dynamics may well involve the ambivalence of the spectators, and also the involvement of those represented in reproducing, and at times contesting the stereotypes of those who represent others.

<doc id="39307" wikidata="Q4411313" url="?curid=39307" title="Adrian and Natalia of Nicomedia">
<text>Adrian of Nicomedia (also known as Hadrian) or Saint Adrian (, died 4 March 306) was a Herculian Guard of the Roman Emperor Galerius Maximian. After becoming a convert to Christianity with his wife Natalia (Ναταλία), Adrian was martyred at Nicomedia in Asia-Minor (Turkey). Adrian was the chief military saint of Northern Europe for many ages, second only to Saint George, and is much revered in Flanders, Germany and the north of France.

==Martyrdom==

Adrian and Natalia lived in Nicomedia during the time of Emperor Maximian in the early fourth century. The twenty-eight-year-old Adrian was head of the praetorium.

It is said that while presiding over the torture of a band of Christians, he asked them what reward they expected to receive from God. They replied, &quot;Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither has entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.&quot; He was so amazed at their courage that he publicly confessed his faith, though he had not yet been baptized. He was then immediately imprisoned. He was forbidden visitors, but accounts state that his wife Natalia came to visit him, dressed as a boy, to ask for his prayers when he entered Heaven.

After his execution, the executioners wanted to burn the bodies of the dead, but a storm arose and quenched the fire. Natalia recovered one of Adrian&#x27;s hands.

==Historicity==
The accuracy of the recorded story has been questioned. A second Hadrian is said to have been a son of the Emperor Probus, and, having embraced Christianity, to have been put to death (A.D. 320), at Nicomedia in Asia Minor, by Emperor Licinius. But no reliable information concerning him is extant. He is commemorated on August 26.

==Feast day and patronage==

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Saint Adrian shares a feast day with his wife on 26 August in the Church Calendar, which for the majority of Orthodox Christians remains on the Julian Calendar, is on 8 September in the Gregorian and global civil calendars; he also has feast days alone on 4 March. In the Roman Catholic Church, he is venerated alone, without his wife, on September 8. The Coptic Orthodox Church likewise venerates St. Adrian and his companions on the third day of the Coptic month known as Nesi (corresponding to September 8), mentioning his wife&#x27;s role during the Synaxarion reading of that day.

Saint Hadrian was the chief military saint of Northern Europe for many ages, second only to Saint George, and is much revered in Flanders, Germany and the north of France. He is usually represented armed, with an anvil in his hands or at his feet.

Sant&#x27;Adriano al Foro, a church in the Roman Forum (founded AD 630), was named in his honour. The name was later transferred to Santa Maria della Mercede e Sant&#x27;Adriano a Villa Albani (1958) when the old church was demolished.

<text>JFK is a 1991 American epic political thriller film written and directed by Oliver Stone. The film examines the investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy by New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison, who came to believe there was a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy and that Lee Harvey Oswald was a scapegoat.

The film&#x27;s screenplay was adapted by Stone and Zachary Sklar from the books &quot;On the Trail of the Assassins&quot; by Garrison and &quot;Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy&quot; by Jim Marrs. Stone described this account as a &quot;counter-myth&quot; to the Warren Commission&#x27;s &quot;fictional myth&quot;. &quot;JFK&quot;″s embrace of conspiracy theories made it controversial. Many major American newspapers ran editorials accusing Stone of spreading untruths, including the claim that Kennedy was killed as part of a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; to install Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson in his place.

Despite the controversy, &quot;JFK&quot; received critical praise for its performances, directing, score, editing, and cinematography. It gradually picked up momentum at the box office after a slow start, grossing over $205 million worldwide, making it the sixth highest-grossing film of 1991 worldwide. It also remains Oliver Stone&#x27;s highest-grossing film to date. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won two for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing. It was the first of three films Stone made about American presidents, followed by &quot;Nixon&quot; (1995) and &quot;W.&quot; (2008).

== Plot ==
During his farewell address in 1961, outgoing President Dwight D. Eisenhower warns about the build-up of the military-industrial complex. He is succeeded by John F. Kennedy as president, whose time in office is marked by the Bay of Pigs Invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis until his assassination in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963. Former US marine and suspected Soviet defector Lee Harvey Oswald is arrested for the murder of police officer J. D. Tippit and arraigned with both murders but is killed by nightclub owner Jack Ruby. New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison and his team investigate potential New Orleans links to the JFK assassination, including private pilot David Ferrie, but their investigation is publicly rebuked by the federal government and Garrison closes the investigation.

The investigation is reopened in 1966 after Garrison reads the Warren Report and notices what he believes to be multiple inaccuracies. Garrison and his staff interrogate people involved with Oswald and Ferrie. One such witness is Willie O&#x27;Keefe, a male prostitute serving five years in prison for solicitation, who says that he witnessed Ferrie talking with a man called &quot;Clay Bertrand&quot; about assassinating Kennedy, and that he briefly met Oswald. Garrison and his team theorize Oswald was an agent of the CIA and was framed for the assassination.

In 1967, Garrison and his team talk to several witnesses, including Jean Hill, a teacher who says she witnessed a gunman shooting from the &quot;grassy knoll&quot;, a small hill, that Secret Service threatened her into saying three shots came from the Texas School Book Depository from which Oswald was said to have shot Kennedy, and her testimony was altered by the Warren Commission. Garrison&#x27;s staff also test fire an empty rifle from the Depository and conclude that Oswald was too poor a marksman to make the shots, and that there was more than one shooter. Garrison comes to believe that &quot;Bertrand&quot; is really New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw. Garrison interviews Shaw, who denies having ever met Ferrie, O&#x27;Keefe or Oswald.

Some key witnesses become scared and refuse to testify while others, such as Ruby and Ferrie, die in suspicious circumstances. Before his death, Ferrie tells Garrison that there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. Garrison meets a high-level figure in Washington D.C. who identifies himself as &quot;X&quot;. He suggests a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; at the highest levels of government, implicating members of the CIA, the Mafia, the military-industrial complex, Secret Service, FBI, and then-Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson as either co-conspirators or as having motives to cover up the truth of the assassination. X suggests that Kennedy was killed because he wanted to pull the United States out of the Vietnam War and dismantle the CIA. X encourages Garrison to keep digging and prosecute Shaw. Soon afterward, Garrison indicts Shaw with conspiring to murder Kennedy.

Garrison&#x27;s marriage is strained when his wife Liz complains that he is spending more time on the case than with his own family. After a sinister phone call is made to their daughter, Liz accuses Garrison of being selfish and attacking Shaw only because of his homosexuality. Some of Garrison&#x27;s staff begin to doubt his motives and disagree with his methods, and leave the investigation. One of them, Bill Broussard, is later revealed to have been an insider for the FBI for some time, and even plays a peripheral, undisclosed role in what seems to be an attempt to kidnap, murder or otherwise scare Garrison. In addition, Garrison is criticized in the media as wasting taxpayer money to investigate a conspiracy theory. Garrison suspects a connection with the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy.

Shaw&#x27;s trial takes place in 1969. Garrison presents the court with a dismissal of the single-bullet theory, proposing a scenario involving three assassins firing six shots and framing Oswald for the murders of Kennedy and Tippit, all for the purpose of installing Johnson as president so he could escalate the war in Vietnam and enrich the defense industry. However, the jury acquits Shaw after less than one hour of deliberation. While his prosecution has failed, Garrison wins his wife and children&#x27;s respect for his determination, and so repairs his relationship with his family.

== Production ==
Zachary Sklar, a journalist and a professor of journalism at the Columbia School of Journalism, met Garrison in 1987 and helped him rewrite a manuscript that he was working on about Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. He changed it from a scholarly book in the third person to &quot;a detective story – a whydunnit&quot; in the first person. Sklar edited the book and it was published in 1988. While attending the Latin American Film Festival in Havana, Cuba, Oliver Stone met Sheridan Square Press publisher Ellen Ray on an elevator. She had published Jim Garrison&#x27;s book &quot;On the Trail of the Assassins&quot;. Ray had gone to New Orleans and worked with Garrison in 1967. She gave Stone a copy of Garrison&#x27;s book and told him to read it. He did and quickly bought the film rights with $250,000 of his own money to prevent talk going around the studios about projects he might be developing.

Kennedy&#x27;s assassination had always had a profound effect on Stone: &quot;The Kennedy murder was one of the signal events of the postwar generation, my generation.&quot; Stone met Garrison and grilled him with a variety of questions for three hours. Garrison stood up to Stone&#x27;s questioning and then got up and left. His pride and dignity impressed the director. Stone&#x27;s impressions from their meeting were that &quot;Garrison made many mistakes. He trusted a lot of weirdos and followed a lot of fake leads. But he went out on a limb, way out. And he kept going, even when he knew he was facing long odds.&quot;

Stone was not interested in making a film about Garrison&#x27;s life, but rather the story behind the conspiracy to kill Kennedy. He also bought the film rights to Jim Marrs&#x27; book &quot;Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy&quot;. One of the filmmaker&#x27;s primary goals with &quot;JFK&quot; was to provide a rebuttal to the Warren Commission&#x27;s report that he believed was &quot;a great myth. And in order to fight a myth, maybe you have to create another one, a counter-myth.&quot; Even though Marrs&#x27; book collected many theories, Stone was hungry for more and hired Jane Rusconi, a recent Yale University graduate, to lead a team of researchers and assemble as much information about the assassination as possible while the director completed post-production on &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;. Stone read two dozen books on the assassination while Rusconi read between 100 and 200 books on the subject.

By December 1989, Stone began approaching studios to back his film. While in pre-production on &quot;The Doors&quot;, he met with three executives at Warner Bros. who wanted him to make a film about Howard Hughes. However, Warren Beatty owned the rights and so Stone pitched &quot;JFK&quot;. Studio president and chief operating officer Terry Semel liked the idea. He had a reputation for making political and controversial films, including &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, &quot;The Parallax View&quot; and &quot;The Killing Fields&quot;. Stone made a handshake deal with Warner Bros. whereby the studio would get all the rights to the film and put up $20 million for the budget. The director did this so that the screenplay would not be widely read and bid on, and he also knew that the material was potentially dangerous and wanted only one studio to finance it. Finally, Stone liked Semel&#x27;s track record of producing political films.

=== Screenplay ===
When Stone set out to write the screenplay, he asked Sklar (who also edited Marrs&#x27; book) to co-write it with him and distill the Garrison and Marrs books and Rusconi&#x27;s research into a script that would resemble what he called &quot;a great detective movie&quot;. Stone told Sklar his vision of the film:
 Although he did employ ideas from &quot;Rashomon&quot;, his principal model for &quot;JFK&quot; was &quot;Z&quot;:
 Stone broke the film&#x27;s structure down into four stories: Garrison investigating the New Orleans connection to the assassination; the research that revealed what Stone calls, &quot;Oswald legend: who he was and how to try to inculcate that&quot;; the recreation of the assassination at Dealey Plaza; and the information that the character of &quot;X&quot; imparts on Garrison, which Stone saw as the &quot;means by which we were able to move between New Orleans, local, into the wider story of Dealey Plaza.&quot;

Sklar worked on the Garrison side of the story while Stone added the Oswald story, the events at Dealey Plaza and the &quot;Mr. X&quot; character. Sklar spent a year researching and writing a 550-page triple-spaced screenplay and then Stone rewrote it and condensed it closer to normal screenplay length. Stone and Sklar used composite characters, most notably the &quot;Mr. X&quot; character played by Donald Sutherland. This was a technique that would be criticized in the press. He was a mix of Richard Case Nagell and retired Air Force colonel Fletcher Prouty, another adviser for the film and who was a military liaison between the CIA and the Pentagon. Meeting Prouty was, for Stone, &quot;one of the most extraordinary afternoons I&#x27;ve ever spent. Pretty much like in the movie, he just started to talk.&quot; According to Stone: 

The screenplay&#x27;s early drafts suggested a four and a half-hour film with a potential budget of $40 million – double what Stone had agreed to with Warner Bros. The director knew film mogul Arnon Milchan and met with him to help finance the film. Milchan was eager to work on the project and launch his new company, Regency Enterprises, with a high profile film like &quot;JFK&quot;. Milchan made a deal with Warner Bros. to put up the money for the film. Stone managed to pare down his initial revision, a 190-page draft, to a 156-page shooting script.

There were many advisers for the film, including Gerald Hemming, a former Marine who claimed involvement in various CIA activities, and Robert Groden, a self-proclaimed photographic expert and longtime JFK assassination researcher and author.

Stone later published &quot;JFK: The Documented Screenplay&quot;, a heavily annotated version of the screenplay in which he cites sources for nearly every claim made in the film ().

=== Casting ===
Trying to cast the role of Garrison, Stone sent copies of the script to Kevin Costner, Mel Gibson, and Harrison Ford. Initially, Costner turned Stone down. However, Costner&#x27;s agent, Michael Ovitz, was a big fan of the project and helped Stone convince Costner to take the role. Before accepting the role, Costner conducted extensive research on Garrison, including meeting the man and his enemies. Two months after finally signing on to play Garrison in January 1991, his film &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; won seven Academy Awards and so his presence greatly enhanced &quot;JFK&quot;″s bankability in the studio&#x27;s eyes.

Tommy Lee Jones was originally considered for another role that was ultimately cut from the film and Stone then decided to cast him as Shaw. In preparation for the film, Jones interviewed Garrison on three different occasions and talked to others who had worked with Shaw and knew him.

Stone originally wanted James Woods to play David Ferrie, but Woods turned it down. Stone also approached Willem Dafoe and John Malkovich, who both also turned down the role.

Stone considered Marlon Brando for the role of Mr. X, which eventually went to Donald Sutherland.

According to Gary Oldman, very little was written about Oswald in the script. Stone gave him several plane tickets, a list of contacts, and told him to do his own research. Oldman met with Oswald&#x27;s wife, Marina, and her two daughters to prepare for the role. Beata Poźniak studied 26 volumes of the Warren Report and spent time living with Marina Oswald. Since the script contained few lines for the Oswalds, Poźniak interviewed acquaintances of the Oswalds in order to improvise her scenes with Gary Oldman.

Many actors were willing to waive their normal fees because of the nature of the project and to lend their support. Martin Sheen provided the opening narration. Jim Garrison played Chief Justice Earl Warren, during the scene in which he questions Jack Ruby in a Dallas jail and in a TV appearance. Assassination witness Beverly Oliver, who claims to be the &quot;Babushka Lady&quot; seen in the Zapruder film, also appeared in a cameo in Ruby&#x27;s club. Sean Stone, Oliver Stone&#x27;s son, plays Garrison&#x27;s oldest son Jasper. Perry Russo, one of the sources for the fictional character Willie O&#x27;Keefe, appeared in a cameo as an angry bar patron who says Oswald should get a medal for shooting Kennedy.

=== Principal photography ===
The story revolves around Costner&#x27;s Jim Garrison, with a large cast of well-known actors in supporting roles. Stone was inspired by the casting model of the documentary epic &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, which he had admired as a child: &quot;It was realistic, but it had a lot of stars ... the supporting cast provides a map of the American psyche: familiar, comfortable faces that walk you through a winding path in the dark woods.&quot;

Cinematographer Robert Richardson was a week and a half into shooting &quot;City of Hope&quot; for John Sayles when he got word that Stone was thinking about making &quot;JFK&quot;. By the time principal photography wrapped on &quot;City of Hope&quot;, Richardson was ready to make Stone&#x27;s film. To prepare, Richardson read up on various JFK assassination books starting with &quot;On the Trail of the Assassins&quot; and &quot;Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy&quot;.

The original idea was to film the opening sequence in 1.33:1 aspect ratio in order to simulate the TV screens that were available at the time of the assassination, then transition to 1.85:1 when Garrison began his investigation, and finally switch to 2.35:1 for scenes occurring in 1968 and later. However, because of time constraints and logistics, Richardson was forced to abandon this approach.

Stone wanted to recreate the Kennedy assassination in Dealey Plaza. His producers had to pay the Dallas City Council a substantial amount of money to hire police to reroute traffic and close streets for three weeks. He only had ten days to shoot all of the footage he needed and so he used seven cameras (two 35 mm and five 16 mm) and 14 film stocks. Getting permission to shoot in the Texas School Book Depository was more difficult. They had to pay $50,000 to put someone in the window from which Oswald was supposed to have shot Kennedy. They were allowed to film in that location only between certain hours with only five people on the floor at one time: the camera crew, an actor and Stone. Co-producer Clayton Townsend has said that the hardest part was getting the permission to restore the building to the way it looked back in 1963. It took five months of negotiation.

The production spent $4 million to restore Dealey Plaza to 1963 conditions. Stone utilized a variety of film stocks. Richardson said, &quot;It depends whether you want to shoot in 35 or 16 or Super 8. In many cases the lighting has to be different.&quot; For certain shots in the film, Stone employed multiple camera crews shooting at once, using five cameras at the same time in different formats. Richardson said of Stone&#x27;s style of direction, &quot;Oliver disdains convention, he tries to force you into things that are not classic. There&#x27;s this constant need to stretch.&quot; This forced the cinematographer to use lighting in diverse positions and rely very little on classic lighting modes. Shooting began on April 15, 1991, and ended on July 31, lasting 78 days with filming finished four-and-a-half months before the release date.

=== Editing ===
&quot;JFK&quot; marked a fundamental change in the way that Stone constructed his films: a subjective lateral presentation of the plot, with the editing&#x27;s rhythm carrying the story. Stone brought in Hank Corwin, an editor of commercials, to help edit the film. Stone chose him because his &quot;chaotic mind&quot; was &quot;totally alien to the film form.&quot; Stone also commented that Corwin &quot;had not developed the long form yet. And so a lot of his cuts were very chaotic.&quot; Stone employed extensive use of flashbacks within flashbacks for a specific effect. He said in an interview: Because of being shot on various sized film stocks, conventional 35mm film editing was impossible. Although digital editing was in nascent form, LightWorks and AVID were still not available as editing systems when editing began on &quot;JFK&quot;. For that reason, all the footage was transferred to 3/4&quot; videotape and edited on videotape. The 35mm film negative, along with the other sized film stocks were then conformed to match the videotape edit.

Years after its release, Stone said of the film that it &quot;was the beginning of a new era for me in terms of film making because it&#x27;s not just about a conspiracy to kill John Kennedy. It&#x27;s also about the way we look at our recent history ... It shifts from black and white to color, and then back again, and views people from offbeat angles.&quot;

=== Music ===

Because of his enormous commitment to Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Hook&quot;, which opened the same month as &quot;JFK&quot;, composer John Williams did not have time to compose a conventional score for the entire film. Instead he composed and conducted six musical sequences in full for &quot;JFK&quot; before he saw the film in its entirety. Soon after recording this music, he traveled to New Orleans where Stone was still shooting the film and saw approximately an hour&#x27;s worth of edited footage and dailies. Williams remembers, &quot;I thought his handling of Lee Harvey Oswald was particularly strong, and I understood some of the atmosphere of the film – the sordid elements, the underside of New Orleans.&quot; Stone and his team then actually cut the film to fit Williams&#x27; music after the composer had scored and recorded musical cues in addition to the six he had done prior to seeing the film. For the motorcade sequence, Williams described the score he composed as &quot;strongly kinetic music, music of interlocking rhythmic disciplines.&quot; The composer remembered the moment he learned of Kennedy&#x27;s assassination and it stuck with him for years. This was a significant factor in his deciding to work on the film. Williams said, &quot;This is a very resonant subject for people of my generation, and that&#x27;s why I welcomed the opportunity to participate in this film.&quot;

== Reception ==
=== Critical reaction ===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;JFK&quot; holds an approval rating of 84% based on 70 reviews and an average rating of 7.7/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;As history, Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;JFK&quot; is dubious, but as filmmaking it&#x27;s electric, cramming a ton of information and excitement into its three-hour runtime and making great use of its outstanding cast.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average of 72 out of 100 based on 29 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

====Pre-release====
The film&#x27;s production and release were subject to intense scrutiny and criticism. A few weeks after shooting had begun, on May 14, 1991, Jon Margolis wrote in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; that &quot;JFK&quot; was &quot;an insult to the intelligence&quot;. Five days later, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ran a scathing article by national security correspondent George Lardner titled, &quot;On the Set: Dallas in Wonderland&quot; that used the first draft of the &quot;JFK&quot; screenplay to blast it for &quot;the absurdities and palpable untruths in Garrison&#x27;s book and Stone&#x27;s rendition of it.&quot; The article pointed out that Garrison lost his case against Clay Shaw and that he inflated his case by trying to use Shaw&#x27;s homosexual relationships to prove guilt by association. Stone responded to Lardner&#x27;s article by hiring a public relations firm that specialized in political issues. Anthony Lewis in &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated the film &quot;tells us that our government cannot be trusted to give an honest account of a Presidential assassination.&quot; &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist George Will called Stone &quot;a man of technical skill, scant education and negligible conscience.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; ran its own critique of the film-in-progress on June 10, 1991, and alleged Stone was trying to suppress a rival JFK assassination film based on Don DeLillo&#x27;s 1988 novel &quot;Libra&quot;. Stone rebutted these claims in a letter to the magazine.

Stone split his time making the film, responding to criticism, and conducting a publicity campaign that saw him &quot;omnipresent, from &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, to &quot;Oprah&quot;.&quot; The Lardner &quot;Post&quot; piece was reputed to have hit Stone the most because Lardner had a copy of the script. Stone recalls, &quot;He had the first draft, and I went through probably six or seven drafts.&quot;

====Post-release====
Upon theatrical release, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran an article by Bernard Weinraub that called for intervention by the studio: &quot;At what point does a studio exercise its leverage and blunt the highly charged message of a film maker like Oliver Stone?&quot; The newspaper ran a review of the film by Vincent Canby who wrote, &quot;Mr. Stone&#x27;s hyperbolic style of film making is familiar: lots of short, often hysterical scenes tumbling one after another, backed by a soundtrack that is layered, strudel-like, with noises, dialogue, music, more noises, more dialogue.&quot; Pat Dowell, film critic for &quot;The Washingtonian&quot;, had her 34-word capsule review for the January issue rejected by her editor Jack Limpert on the grounds he did not want the magazine to give a positive review to a film he felt was &quot;preposterous&quot;. Dowell resigned in protest.

Richard Corliss, &quot;Time&quot;″s film critic, wrote:

Whatever one&#x27;s suspicions about its use or abuse of the evidence, &quot;JFK&quot; is a knockout. Part history book, part comic book, the movie rushes toward judgment for three breathless hours, lassoing facts and factoids by the thousands, then bundling them together into an incendiary device that would frag any viewer&#x27;s complacency. Stone&#x27;s picture is, in both meanings of the word, sensational: it&#x27;s tip-top tabloid journalism. In its bravura and breadth, &quot;JFK&quot; is seditiously enthralling; in its craft, wondrously complex.

The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; said, &quot;the focus on the trivialities of personality conveniently prevents us from having to confront the tough questions [Stone&#x27;s] film raises.&quot; Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert both gave the film positive reviews on their television show. Writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Siskel called the film &quot;thoroughly compelling&quot; and suggested that while it contained &quot;gross alterations of fact&quot;, Stone had &quot;the right to speculate on American history&quot;. Ebert praised the film in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, saying,
 Rita Kempley in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Quoting everyone from Shakespeare to Hitler to bolster their arguments, Stone and Sklar present a gripping alternative to the Warren Commission&#x27;s conclusion. A marvelously paranoid thriller featuring a closetful of spies, moles, pro-commies and Cuban freedom-fighters, the whole thing might have been thought up by Robert Ludlum.&quot;

&quot;New York Newsday&quot; published two articles on Boxing Day: &quot;The Blurred Vision of &quot;JFK&quot;&quot; and &quot;The Many Theories of a Jolly Green Giant&quot;. A few days later, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; followed suit with &quot;Stone&#x27;s Film Trashes Facts, Dishonors J.F.K.&quot; Jack Valenti, then president and chief executive of the Motion Picture Association of America, denounced Stone&#x27;s film in a seven-page statement. He wrote: &quot;In much the same way, young German boys and girls in 1941 were mesmerized by Leni Riefenstahl&#x27;s &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;, in which Adolf Hitler was depicted as a newborn God. Both &quot;JFK&quot; and &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; are equally a propaganda masterpiece and equally a hoax. Mr. Stone and Leni Riefenstahl have another genetic linkage: neither of them carried a disclaimer on their film that its contents were mostly pure fiction.&quot; Stone recalls in an interview, &quot;I can&#x27;t even remember all the threats, there were so many of them.&quot;

&quot;TIME&quot; magazine ranked it the fourth best film of 1991, while also including it in &quot;Top 10 Historically Misleading Films&quot; in 2011.

Ebert named Stone&#x27;s film as the year&#x27;s best and one of the top ten films of the decade as well as one of The Great Movies. Gene Siskel ranked it the seventh best film of the year. The &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; named &quot;JFK&quot; as the best film of 1991. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked it the 5th Most Controversial Movie Ever.

Ebert&#x27;s future colleague Richard Roeper was less complimentary: &quot;One can admire Stone&#x27;s filmmaking skills and the performances here while denouncing the utter crapola presented as &#x27;evidence&#x27; of a conspiracy to murder.&quot; Roeper applauded the film&#x27;s &quot;dazzling array of filmmaking techniques and a stellar roster of actors&quot; but criticized Stone&#x27;s narrative: &quot;As a work of fantastical fiction, &quot;JFK&quot; is an interesting if overblown vision of a parallel universe. As a dramatic interpretation of events, it&#x27;s journalistically bankrupt nonsense.&quot;

Harry Connick Sr., the New Orleans district attorney who defeated Garrison in 1973, criticized Stone&#x27;s view of the assassination: &quot;Stone was either unaware of the details and particulars of the Clay Shaw investigation and trial or, if he was aware, that didn&#x27;t get in his way of what he perceived to be the way the case should have been.&quot; In his book &quot;Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy&quot;, a history of the assassination published 16 years after the film&#x27;s release, Vincent Bugliosi devoted an entire chapter to Garrison&#x27;s prosecution of Shaw and Stone&#x27;s subsequent film. Bugliosi lists thirty-two separate &quot;lies and fabrications&quot; in Stone&#x27;s film and describes the film as &quot;one continuous lie in which Stone couldn&#x27;t find any level of deception and invention beyond which he was unwilling to go.&quot; David R. Wrone stated that &quot;80 percent of the film is in factual error&quot; and rejected the premise of a conspiracy involving the CIA and the so-called military-industrial complex as &quot;irrational&quot;. Warren Commission investigator David Belin called the film &quot;a big lie that would make Adolf Hitler proud&quot;. Former Indiana Representative Floyd Fithian, who had served on the House Select Committee on Assassinations said the film had manipulated the past. Kennedy&#x27;s son, John F. Kennedy Jr., refused to watch the film, &quot;because that&#x27;s not entertainment for me… people, historians, filmmakers…are going to take time and money studying (the assassination).&quot; He cared little about the controversy, stating that regardless of the truth, it would not bring his father back. Clint Hill, a Secret Service agent who was with Kennedy when he was shot, criticized the film, calling it &quot;absurd&quot;.

=== Box-office ===
&quot;JFK&quot; was released in theaters on December 20, 1991. In its first week of release, &quot;JFK&quot; tied with &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; for fifth place in the U.S. box office and its critics began to say it was a flop. Warner Bros. executives argued that this was at least partly because the film&#x27;s long running time meant it had had fewer screenings than other films. Box-office picked up momentum, however, in part due to a $15 million marketing campaign from the studio. By the first week in January 1992, it had grossed over $50 million worldwide, eventually earning over $200 million worldwide and $70 million in the United States during its initial run.

Garrison&#x27;s estate subsequently sued Warner Bros. for a share of the film&#x27;s profits, alleging fraud perpetrated through a book-keeping practice known as &quot;Hollywood accounting&quot;. The lawsuit contended that &quot;JFK&quot; made in excess of $150 million worldwide but the studio claimed that, under its &quot;net profits&quot; accounting formula, the film earned no money, and that Garrison&#x27;s estate did not receive any of the more than $1 million net profits income he was due.

=== Awards and nominations ===

Upon winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Director – Motion Picture, Stone said in his acceptance speech: &quot;A terrible lie was told to us 28 years ago. I hope that this film can be the first step in righting that wrong.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked &quot;JFK&quot; as one of the 25 &quot;Powerful Political Thrillers&quot;. In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed the film as the ninth best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership.

== Legislative impact ==

The final report of the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) partially credited concern over the conclusions in &quot;JFK&quot; with the passage of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, also known as the JFK Act.

The ARRB stated that the film &quot;popularized a version of President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination that featured U.S. government agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the military as conspirators.&quot; While describing the film as &quot;largely fictional&quot;, the ARRB acknowledged Stone&#x27;s point that official records were to be sealed from the public until 2029, and his suggestion that &quot;Americans could not trust official public conclusions when those conclusions had been made in secret.&quot; By ARRB law, all existing assassination-related documents were to be made public by 2017, and most are now released.

== Home media and alternate versions ==
The original theatrical cut of &quot;JFK&quot; was released on VHS and Laserdisc on May 20, 1992.

The &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; of the film, extending it to 206 minutes, was released on VHS and laserdisc in 1993.

The Director&#x27;s Cut was released on DVD in 1997.

On January 16, 2001, the Director&#x27;s Cut was re-released on DVD as part of the Oliver Stone Collection box-set, with the film on one disc and supplemental material on the second. Stone contributed several extras to this edition, including an audio commentary, two multimedia essays, and 54 minutes&#x27; worth of deleted/extended scenes with optional commentary by Stone.

On November 11, 2003, a &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD of the Director&#x27;s Cut was released with the film on one disc and all of the extras from the 2001 edition on a second disc, in addition to a 90-minute documentary entitled, &quot;Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy&quot;.

The Director&#x27;s Cut was released on Blu-ray on November 11, 2008. The disc features many of the extras included on the previous DVD releases, including the &quot;Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy&quot; documentary.

The theatrical cut was not released on physical media in the US for many years after the first 1992 laserdisc and VHS releases, although it was released on DVD in the United Kingdom as a poor quality non-anamorphic transfer. The theatrical cut and the director&#x27;s cut were both made available for digital download and streaming in the United States.

On December 19, 2023, Shout! Factory, through their Shout Select label, released both the theatrical and extended versions together as a boxset on UHD &amp; Blu-ray. However, while the director&#x27;s cut was made available on the 4K disc, the theatrical cut has only been included as a remastered Blu-ray disc.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Seinfeld&quot; spoofed the film in the 1992 episode &quot;The Boyfriend&quot;.

The &quot;back and to the left&quot; scene was parodied on an episode on the cult animated sitcom &quot;The Critic&quot;.

The film is referenced twice in the 90s sitcom &quot;Family Matters&quot; by Waldo Faldo, who pronounces the name literally. During a date with Laura Winslow, he says &quot;We should&#x27;ve seen &#x27;Jifkuh&#x27;.&quot; When Laura corrects him with &quot;Oh you mean JFK.&quot;, he responds &quot;I know how it&#x27;s spelled!&quot; The second time was following his date with Maxine, where the movie choices were either &quot;Malcolm X&quot; (which he believes stood for the Roman numeral 10) or &quot;Jifkuh&quot;.

The film was used for Stan Dane&#x27;s book &quot;Prayer Man: The Exoneration of Lee Harvey Oswald&quot; to have high quality frames of the James Darnell film to support a theory that a man standing on the Depository front steps during the assassination, referred to as &quot;prayer man&quot;, is Oswald.

<text>&quot;The Manifesto of the Italian Fasces of Combat&quot; (), also referred to as the Fascist Manifesto or the San Sepolcro Programme (&quot;Programma di San Sepolcro&quot;) being the political platform developed from statements made during the founding of the &quot;Fasci Italiani di Combattimento&quot;, held in Piazza San Sepolcro in Milan on March 23, 1919. 

It was the initial declaration of the political stance of the &quot;Fasci Italiani di Combattimento&quot; (&quot;Italian Fasces of Combat&quot;) the movement founded in Milan by Benito Mussolini in 1919 and it is an early expression of fascism known as &quot;sansepolcrismo&quot;. The Manifesto was co-authored by national syndicalist Alceste de Ambris and the futurist poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti.

== Text ==
== Contents of the Fascist Manifesto ==
The Manifesto (published in &quot;Il Popolo d&#x27;Italia&quot; on June 6, 1919) is divided into four sections, describing the movement&#x27;s objectives in political, social, military and financial fields.

Politically, the Manifesto calls for:
* Universal suffrage with a lowered voting age to 18 years, and voting and electoral office eligibility for all ages 25 and up;
* Proportional representation on a regional basis;
* Voting for women;
* Representation at government level of newly created national councils by economic sector;
* The abolition of the Italian Senate (at the time, the Senate, as the upper house of parliament, was by process elected by the wealthier citizens, but were in reality direct appointments by the king. It has been described as a sort of extended council of the crown);
* The formation of a national council of experts for labor, for industry, for transportation, for the public health, for communications, etc. Selections to be made of professionals or of tradesmen with legislative powers, and elected directly to a general commission with ministerial powers.

In labor and social policy, the Manifesto calls for:
* The quick enactment of a law of the state that sanctions an eight-hour workday for all workers;
* A minimum wage;
* The participation of workers&#x27; representatives in the functions of industry commissions;
* To show the same confidence in the labor unions (that prove to be technically and morally worthy) as is given to industry executives or public servants;
* Reorganization of the railways and the public transport sector;
* Revision of the draft law on invalidity insurance;
* Reduction of the retirement age from 65 to 55.

In military affairs, the Manifesto advocates:
* Creation of a short-service national militia with specifically defensive responsibilities;
* Armaments factories are to be nationalized;
* A peaceful but competitive foreign policy.

In finance, the Manifesto advocates:
* A strong extraordinary tax on capital of a progressive nature, which takes the form of true partial expropriation of all wealth;
* The seizure of all the possessions of the religious congregations and the abolition of all diocesan benefices, which constitute an enormous liability on the Nation and on the privileges of the poor;
* Revision of all contracts for military provisions;
* The revision of all military contracts and the seizure of 85 percent of the profits therein.

These early positions reflected in the Manifesto would later be characterized by Mussolini in &quot;The Doctrine of Fascism&quot; as &quot;a series of pointers, forecasts, hints which, when freed from the inevitable matrix of contingencies, were to develop in a few years time into a series of doctrinal positions entitling Fascism to rank as a political doctrine differing from all others, past or present.&quot; 

== The Manifesto in practice ==
Of the Manifesto&#x27;s proposals, the commitment to corporative organisation of economic interests was to be the longest lasting. Far from becoming a medium of extended democracy, parliament became by law an exclusively Fascist-picked body in 1929; being replaced by the &quot;chamber of corporations&quot; a decade later.

Eight-hour workday was introduced in 1925.

Fascism&#x27;s pacifist foreign policy ceased during its first year of Italian government. In September 1923, the Corfu crisis demonstrated the regime&#x27;s willingness to use force internationally. Perhaps the greatest success of Fascist diplomacy was the Lateran Treaty of February 1929, which accepted the principle of non-interference in the affairs of the Church. This ended the 59-year-old dispute between Italy and the Papacy.

<text>A compass is a device that shows the cardinal directions used for navigation and geographic orientation. It commonly consists of a magnetized needle or other element, such as a compass card or compass rose, which can pivot to align itself with magnetic north. Other methods may be used, including gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS receivers.

Compasses often show angles in degrees: north corresponds to 0°, and the angles increase clockwise, so east is 90°, south is 180°, and west is 270°. These numbers allow the compass to show azimuths or bearings which are commonly stated in degrees. If local variation between magnetic north and true north is known, then direction of magnetic north also gives direction of true north.

Among the Four Great Inventions, the magnetic compass was first invented as a device for divination as early as the Chinese Han dynasty (since c. 206 BC), and later adopted for navigation by the Song dynasty Chinese during the 11th century. The first usage of a compass recorded in Western Europe and the Islamic world occurred around 1190.

The magnetic compass is the most familiar compass type. It functions as a pointer to &quot;magnetic north&quot;, the local magnetic meridian, because the magnetized needle at its heart aligns itself with the horizontal component of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. The magnetic field exerts a torque on the needle, pulling the North end or &quot;pole&quot; of the needle approximately toward the Earth&#x27;s North magnetic pole, and pulling the other toward the Earth&#x27;s South magnetic pole. The needle is mounted on a low-friction pivot point, in better compasses a jewel bearing, so it can turn easily. When the compass is held level, the needle turns until, after a few seconds to allow oscillations to die out, it settles into its equilibrium orientation.

In navigation, directions on maps are usually expressed with reference to geographical or true north, the direction toward the Geographical North Pole, the rotation axis of the Earth. Depending on where the compass is located on the surface of the Earth the angle between true north and magnetic north, called magnetic declination can vary widely with geographic location. The local magnetic declination is given on most maps, to allow the map to be oriented with a compass parallel to true north. The locations of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic poles slowly change with time, which is referred to as geomagnetic secular variation. The effect of this means a map with the latest declination information should be used. Some magnetic compasses include means to manually compensate for the magnetic declination, so that the compass shows true directions.

== History ==

===Natural magnet===
One of the earliest known references to lodestone&#x27;s magnetic properties was made by 6th century BC Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus, whom the ancient Greeks credited with discovering lodestone&#x27;s attraction to iron and other lodestones. The name &quot;magnet&quot; may come from lodestones found in Magnesia, Anatolia. The ancient Indian medical text &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot; describes using magnetic properties of the lodestone to remove arrows embedded in a person&#x27;s body.
The earliest Chinese literary reference to magnetism occurs in the 4th-century BC &quot;Book of the Devil Valley Master&quot; (&quot;Guiguzi&quot;).
In the chronicle &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot;, from the 2nd century BC, it is explicitly stated that &quot;the lodestone makes iron come or it attracts it.&quot;

===Artificial compass===

Some claims state that the first compasses in ancient Han dynasty China were made of lodestone, a naturally magnetized ore of iron. The earliest mention of a needle&#x27;s attraction appears in a work composed between 20 and 100 AD, the &quot;Lunheng&quot; (&quot;Balanced Inquiries&quot;): &quot;A lodestone attracts a needle.&quot; In the 2nd century BC, Chinese geomancers were experimenting with the magnetic properties of lodestone to make a &quot;south-pointing spoon&quot; for divination. When it is placed on a smooth bronze plate, the spoon would invariably rotate to a north–south axis. While this has been shown to work, archaeologists have yet to discover an actual spoon made of magnetite in a Han tomb.

The wet compass reached Southern India in the 4th century AD. Later compasses were made of iron needles, magnetized by striking them with a lodestone, which appeared in China by 1088 during the Song dynasty, as described by Shen Kuo. Dry compasses began to appear around 1300 in Medieval Europe and the Islamic world. This was supplanted in the early 20th century by the liquid-filled magnetic compass.

== Design ==
Modern compasses usually use a magnetized needle or dial inside a capsule completely filled with a liquid (lamp oil, mineral oil, white spirits, purified kerosene, or ethyl alcohol are common). While older designs commonly incorporated a flexible rubber diaphragm or airspace inside the capsule to allow for volume changes caused by temperature or altitude, some modern liquid compasses use smaller housings and/or flexible capsule materials to accomplish the same result. The liquid inside the capsule serves to damp the movement of the needle, reducing oscillation time and increasing stability. Key points on the compass, including the north end of the needle are often marked with phosphorescent, photoluminescent, or self-luminous materials to enable the compass to be read at night or in poor light. As the compass fill liquid is noncompressible under pressure, many ordinary liquid-filled compasses will operate accurately underwater to considerable depths.

Many modern compasses incorporate a baseplate and protractor tool, and are referred to variously as &quot;orienteering&quot;, &quot;baseplate&quot;, &quot;map compass&quot; or &quot;protractor&quot; designs. This type of compass uses a separate magnetized needle inside a rotating capsule, an orienting &quot;box&quot; or gate for aligning the needle with magnetic north, a transparent base containing map orienting lines, and a bezel (outer dial) marked in degrees or other units of angular measurement. The capsule is mounted in a transparent baseplate containing a &quot;direction-of-travel&quot; (DOT) indicator for use in taking bearings directly from a map.

Other features found on modern orienteering compasses are map and romer scales for measuring distances and plotting positions on maps, luminous markings on the face or bezels, various sighting mechanisms (mirror, prism, etc.) for taking bearings of distant objects with greater precision, gimbal-mounted, &quot;global&quot; needles for use in differing hemispheres, special rare-earth magnets to stabilize compass needles, adjustable declination for obtaining instant true bearings without resorting to arithmetic, and devices such as inclinometers for measuring gradients. The sport of orienteering has also resulted in the development of models with extremely fast-settling and stable needles utilizing rare-earth magnets for optimal use with a topographic map, a land navigation technique known as &quot;terrain association&quot;. Many marine compasses designed for use on boats with constantly shifting angles use dampening fluids such as isopar M or isopar L to limit the rapid fluctuation and direction of the needle.

The military forces of a few nations, notably the United States Army, continue to issue field compasses with magnetized compass dials or cards instead of needles. A magnetic card compass is usually equipped with an optical, lensatic, or prismatic sight, which allows the user to read the bearing or azimuth off the compass card while simultaneously aligning the compass with the objective (see photo). Magnetic card compass designs normally require a separate protractor tool in order to take bearings directly from a map.

The U.S. M-1950 military lensatic compass does not use a liquid-filled capsule as a damping mechanism, but rather electromagnetic induction to control oscillation of its magnetized card. A &quot;deep-well&quot; design is used to allow the compass to be used globally with a card tilt of up to 8 degrees without impairing accuracy. As induction forces provide less damping than fluid-filled designs, a needle lock is fitted to the compass to reduce wear, operated by the folding action of the rear sight/lens holder. The use of air-filled induction compasses has declined over the years, as they may become inoperative or inaccurate in freezing temperatures or extremely humid environments due to condensation or water ingress.

Some military compasses, like the U.S. M-1950 (Cammenga 3H) military lensatic compass, the Silva 4b &quot;Militaire&quot;, and the Suunto M-5N(T) contain the radioactive material tritium () and a combination of phosphors. The U.S. M-1950 equipped with self-luminous lighting contains 120 mCi (millicuries) of tritium. The purpose of the tritium and phosphors is to provide illumination for the compass, via radioluminescent tritium illumination, which does not require the compass to be &quot;recharged&quot; by sunlight or artificial light. However, tritium has a half-life of only about 12 years, so a compass that contains 120 mCi of tritium when new will contain only 60 when it is 12 years old, 30 when it is 24 years old, and so on. Consequently, the illumination of the display will fade.

Mariners&#x27; compasses can have two or more magnets permanently attached to a compass card, which moves freely on a pivot. A &quot;lubber line&quot;, which can be a marking on the compass bowl or a small fixed needle, indicates the ship&#x27;s heading on the compass card. Traditionally the card is divided into thirty-two points (known as &quot;rhumbs&quot;), although modern compasses are marked in degrees rather than cardinal points. The glass-covered box (or bowl) contains a suspended gimbal within a binnacle. This preserves the horizontal position.
The magnetic compass is very reliable at moderate latitudes, but in geographic regions near the Earth&#x27;s magnetic poles it becomes unusable. As the compass is moved closer to one of the magnetic poles, the magnetic declination, the difference between the direction to geographical north and magnetic north, becomes greater and greater. At some point close to the magnetic pole the compass will not indicate any particular direction but will begin to drift. Also, the needle starts to point up or down when getting closer to the poles, because of the so-called magnetic inclination. Cheap compasses with bad bearings may get stuck because of this and therefore indicate a wrong direction.

Magnetic compasses are influenced by any fields other than Earth&#x27;s. Local environments may contain magnetic mineral deposits and artificial sources such as MRIs, large iron or steel bodies, electrical engines or strong permanent magnets. Any electrically conductive body produces its own magnetic field when it is carrying an electric current. Magnetic compasses are prone to errors in the neighborhood of such bodies. Some compasses include magnets which can be adjusted to compensate for external magnetic fields, making the compass more reliable and accurate.

A compass is also subject to errors when the compass is accelerated or decelerated in an airplane or automobile. Depending on which of the Earth&#x27;s hemispheres the compass is located and if the force is acceleration or deceleration the compass will increase or decrease the indicated heading. Compasses that include compensating magnets are especially prone to these errors, since accelerations tilt the needle, bringing it closer or further from the magnets.

Another error of the mechanical compass is the turning error. When one turns from a heading of east or west the compass will lag behind the turn or lead ahead of the turn. Magnetometers, and substitutes such as gyrocompasses, are more stable in such situations.

== Variants ==
A thumb compass is a type of compass commonly used in orienteering, a sport in which map reading and terrain association are paramount. Consequently, most thumb compasses have minimal or no degree markings at all, and are normally used only to orient the map to magnetic north. An oversized rectangular needle or north indicator aids visibility. Thumb compasses are also often transparent so that an orienteer can hold a map in the hand with the compass and see the map through the compass. The best models use rare-earth magnets to reduce needle settling time to 1 second or less.

The earth inductor compass (or &quot;induction compass&quot;) determines directions using the principle of electromagnetic induction, with the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field acting as the induction field for an electric generator, the measurable output of which varies depending on orientation .

A vertical card magnetic compass installed in an airplane can eliminate some magnetic dipping errors while making the compass less confusing to read in the cockpit. The compass dial is driven by a set of gears controlled by a magnet mounted on a shaft. Eddy current induced into a damping cup also helps mitigate magnet oscillation.

Small electronic compasses (eCompasses) found in clocks, mobile phones, and other electronic devices are solid-state microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) compasses, usually built out of two or three magnetic field sensors that provide data for a microprocessor. Often, the device is a discrete component which outputs either a digital or analog signal proportional to its orientation. This signal is interpreted by a controller or microprocessor and either used internally, or sent to a display unit. The sensor uses highly calibrated internal electronics to measure the response of the device to the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

Apart from navigational compasses, other specialty compasses have also been designed to accommodate specific uses. These include:

* The Qibla compass, which is used by Muslims to show the direction to Mecca for prayers.
* The optical or prismatic compass, most often used by surveyors, but also by cave explorers, foresters, and geologists. These compasses generally use a liquid-damped capsule and magnetized floating compass dial with an integral optical sight, often fitted with built-in photoluminescent or battery-powered illumination. Using the optical sight, such compasses can be read with extreme accuracy when taking bearings to an object, often to fractions of a degree. Most of these compasses are designed for heavy-duty use, with high-quality needles and jeweled bearings, and many are fitted for tripod mounting for additional accuracy.
* The trough compass, mounted in a rectangular box whose length was often several times its width, date back several centuries. They were used for land surveying, particularly with plane tables.
* The luopan, a compass used by feng shui practitioners.

== Construction ==
A magnetic rod is required when constructing a compass. This can be created by aligning an iron or steel rod with Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and then tempering or striking it. However, this method produces only a weak magnet so other methods are preferred. For example, a magnetised rod can be created by repeatedly rubbing an iron rod with a magnetic lodestone. This magnetised rod (or magnetic needle) is then placed on a low-friction surface to allow it to freely pivot to align itself with the magnetic field. It is then labeled so the user can distinguish the north-pointing from the south-pointing end; in modern convention the north end is typically marked in some way.

If a needle is rubbed on a lodestone or other magnet, the needle becomes magnetized. When it is inserted in a cork or piece of wood, and placed in a bowl of water it becomes a compass. Such devices were universally used as compasses until the invention of the box-like compass with a &quot;dry&quot; pivoting needle, sometime around 1300.

Originally, many compasses were marked only as to the direction of magnetic north, or to the four cardinal points (north, south, east, west). Later, these were divided, in China into 24, and in Europe into 32 equally spaced points around the compass card. For a table of the thirty-two points, see compass points.

In the modern era, the 360-degree system took hold. This system is still in use today for civilian navigators. The degree system spaces 360 equidistant points located clockwise around the compass dial. In the 19th century some European nations adopted the &quot;grad&quot; (also called grade or gon) system instead, where a right angle is 100 grads to give a circle of 400 grads. Dividing grads into tenths to give a circle of 4000 decigrades has also been used in armies.

Most military forces have adopted the French &quot;millieme&quot; system. This is an approximation of a milli-radian (6283 per circle), in which the compass dial is spaced into 6400 units or &quot;mils&quot; for additional precision when measuring angles, laying artillery, etc. The value to the military is that one angular mil subtends approximately one metre at a distance of one kilometer. Imperial Russia used a system derived by dividing the circumference of a circle into chords of the same length as the radius. Each of these was divided into 100 spaces, giving a circle of 600. The Soviet Union divided these into tenths to give a circle of 6000 units, usually translated as &quot;mils&quot;. This system was adopted by the former Warsaw Pact countries, &quot;e.g.&quot;, the Soviet Union, East Germany, etc., often counterclockwise (see picture of wrist compass). This is still in use in Russia.

Because the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field&#x27;s inclination and intensity vary at different latitudes, compasses are often balanced during manufacture so that the dial or needle will be level, eliminating needle drag. Most manufacturers balance their compass needles for one of five zones, ranging from zone 1, covering most of the Northern Hemisphere, to zone 5 covering Australia and the southern oceans. This individual zone balancing prevents excessive dipping of one end of the needle, which can cause the compass card to stick and give false readings.

Some compasses feature a special needle balancing system that will accurately indicate magnetic north regardless of the particular magnetic zone. Other magnetic compasses have a small sliding counterweight installed on the needle. This sliding counterweight, called a &quot;rider&quot;, can be used for counterbalancing the needle against the dip caused by inclination if the compass is taken to a zone with a higher or lower dip.

Like any magnetic device, compasses are affected by nearby ferrous materials, as well as by strong local electromagnetic forces. Compasses used for wilderness land navigation should not be used in proximity to ferrous metal objects or electromagnetic fields (car electrical systems, automobile engines, steel pitons, etc.) as that can affect their accuracy. Compasses are particularly difficult to use accurately in or near trucks, cars or other mechanized vehicles even when corrected for deviation by the use of built-in magnets or other devices. Large amounts of ferrous metal combined with the on-and-off electrical fields caused by the vehicle&#x27;s ignition and charging systems generally result in significant compass errors.

At sea, a ship&#x27;s compass must also be corrected for errors, called deviation, caused by iron and steel in its structure and equipment. The ship is &quot;swung&quot;, that is rotated about a fixed point while its heading is noted by alignment with fixed points on the shore. A compass deviation card is prepared so that the navigator can convert between compass and magnetic headings. The compass can be corrected in three ways. First the lubber line can be adjusted so that it is aligned with the direction in which the ship travels, then the effects of permanent magnets can be corrected for by small magnets fitted within the case of the compass. The effect of ferromagnetic materials in the compass&#x27;s environment can be corrected by two iron balls mounted on either side of the compass binnacle in concert with permanent magnets and a Flinders bar. The coefficient formula_1 represents the error in the lubber line, while formula_2 the ferromagnetic effects and formula_3 the non-ferromagnetic component.

A similar process is used to calibrate the compass in light general aviation aircraft, with the compass deviation card often mounted permanently just above or below the magnetic compass on the instrument panel. Fluxgate electronic compasses can be calibrated automatically, and can also be programmed with the correct local compass variation so as to indicate the true heading.

== Use ==


A magnetic compass points to magnetic north pole, which is approximately 1,000 miles from the true geographic North Pole. A magnetic compass&#x27;s user can determine true North by finding the magnetic north and then correcting for variation and deviation. Variation is defined as the angle between the direction of true (geographic) north and the direction of the meridian between the magnetic poles. Variation values for most of the oceans had been calculated and published by 1914. Deviation refers to the response of the compass to local magnetic fields caused by the presence of iron and electric currents; one can partly compensate for these by careful location of the compass and the placement of compensating magnets under the compass itself. Mariners have long known that these measures do not completely cancel deviation; hence, they performed an additional step by measuring the compass bearing of a landmark with a known magnetic bearing. They then pointed their ship to the next compass point and measured again, graphing their results. In this way, correction tables could be created, which would be consulted when compasses were used when traveling in those locations.

Mariners are concerned about very accurate measurements; however, casual users need not be concerned with differences between magnetic and true North. Except in areas of extreme magnetic declination variance (20 degrees or more), this is enough to protect from walking in a substantially different direction than expected over short distances, provided the terrain is fairly flat and visibility is not impaired. By carefully recording distances (time or paces) and magnetic bearings traveled, one can plot a course and return to one&#x27;s starting point using the compass alone.

Compass navigation in conjunction with a map (&quot;terrain association&quot;) requires a different method. To take a map bearing or &quot;true bearing&quot; (a bearing taken in reference to true, not magnetic north) to a destination with a protractor compass, the edge of the compass is placed on the map so that it connects the current location with the desired destination (some sources recommend physically drawing a line). The orienting lines in the base of the compass dial are then rotated to align with actual or true north by aligning them with a marked line of longitude (or the vertical margin of the map), ignoring the compass needle entirely. The resulting &quot;true bearing&quot; or map bearing may then be read at the degree indicator or direction-of-travel (DOT) line, which may be followed as an &quot;azimuth&quot; (course) to the destination. If a &quot;magnetic&quot; north bearing or &quot;compass bearing&quot; is desired, the compass must be adjusted by the amount of magnetic declination before using the bearing so that both map and compass are in agreement. In the given example, the large mountain in the second photo was selected as the target destination on the map. Some compasses allow the scale to be adjusted to compensate for the local magnetic declination; if adjusted correctly, the compass will give the true bearing instead of the magnetic bearing.

The modern hand-held protractor compass always has an additional direction-of-travel (DOT) arrow or indicator inscribed on the baseplate. To check one&#x27;s progress along a course or azimuth, or to ensure that the object in view is indeed the destination, a new compass reading may be taken to the target if visible (here, the large mountain). After pointing the DOT arrow on the baseplate at the target, the compass is oriented so that the needle is superimposed over the orienting arrow in the capsule. The resulting bearing indicated is the magnetic bearing to the target. Again, if one is using &quot;true&quot; or map bearings, and the compass does not have preset, pre-adjusted declination, one must additionally add or subtract magnetic declination to convert the &quot;magnetic bearing&quot; into a &quot;true bearing&quot;. The exact value of the magnetic declination is place-dependent and varies over time, though declination is frequently given on the map itself or obtainable on-line from various sites. If the hiker has been following the correct path, the compass&#x27; corrected (true) indicated bearing should closely correspond to the true bearing previously obtained from the map.

A compass should be laid down on a level surface so that the needle only rests or hangs on the bearing fused to the compass casing – if used at a tilt, the needle might touch the casing on the compass and not move freely, hence not pointing to the magnetic north accurately, giving a faulty reading. To see if the needle is well leveled, look closely at the needle, and tilt it slightly to see if the needle is swaying side to side freely and the needle is not contacting the casing of the compass. If the needle tilts to one direction, tilt the compass slightly and gently to the opposing direction until the compass needle is horizontal, lengthwise. Items to avoid around compasses are magnets of any kind and any electronics. Magnetic fields from electronics can easily disrupt the needle, preventing it from aligning with the Earth&#x27;s magnetic fields, causing inaccurate readings. The Earth&#x27;s natural magnetic forces are considerably weak, measuring at 0.5 gauss and magnetic fields from household electronics can easily exceed it, overpowering the compass needle. Exposure to strong magnets, or magnetic interference can sometimes cause the magnetic poles of the compass needle to differ or even reverse. Avoid iron rich deposits when using a compass, for example, certain rocks which contain magnetic minerals, like Magnetite. This is often indicated by a rock with a surface which is dark and has a metallic luster, not all magnetic mineral bearing rocks have this indication. To see if a rock or an area is causing interference on a compass, get out of the area, and see if the needle on the compass moves. If it does, it means that the area or rock the compass was previously at is causing interference and should be avoided.

== Non-magnetic compasses ==

There are other ways to find north than the use of magnetism, and from a navigational point of view a total of seven possible ways exist (where magnetism is one of the seven). Two sensors that use two of the remaining six principles are often also called compasses, i.e. the gyrocompass and GPS-compass.

A gyrocompass is similar to a gyroscope. It is a non-magnetic compass that finds true north by using an (electrically powered) fast-spinning wheel and friction forces in order to exploit the rotation of the Earth. Gyrocompasses are widely used on ships. They have two main advantages over magnetic compasses:
* they find &quot;true north&quot;, i.e., the direction of Earth&#x27;s rotational axis, as opposed to magnetic north,
* they are not affected by ferromagnetic metal (including iron, steel, cobalt, nickel, and various alloys) in a ship&#x27;s hull. (No compass is affected by nonferromagnetic metal, although a magnetic compass will be affected by any kind of wires with electric current passing through them.)

Large ships typically rely on a gyrocompass, using the magnetic compass only as a backup. Increasingly, electronic fluxgate compasses are used on smaller vessels. However, magnetic compasses are still widely in use as they can be small, use simple reliable technology, are comparatively cheap, are often easier to use than GPS, require no energy supply, and unlike GPS, are not affected by objects, e.g. trees, that can block the reception of electronic signals.

GPS receivers using two or more antennae mounted separately and blending the data with an inertial motion unit (IMU) can now achieve 0.02° in heading accuracy and have startup times in seconds rather than hours for gyrocompass systems. The devices accurately determine the positions (latitudes, longitudes and altitude) of the antennae on the Earth, from which the cardinal directions can be calculated. Manufactured primarily for maritime and aviation applications, they can also detect pitch and roll of ships. Small, portable GPS receivers with only a single antenna can also determine directions if they are being moved, even if only at walking pace. By accurately determining its position on the Earth at times a few seconds apart, the device can calculate its speed and the true bearing (relative to &quot;true north&quot;) of its direction of motion. Frequently, it is preferable to measure the direction in which a vehicle is actually moving, rather than its heading, i.e. the direction in which its nose is pointing. These directions may be different if there is a crosswind or tidal current.

GPS compasses share the main advantages of gyrocompasses. They determine true North, as opposed to magnetic North, and they are unaffected by perturbations of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Additionally, compared with gyrocompasses, they are much cheaper, they work better in polar regions, they are less prone to be affected by mechanical vibration, and they can be initialized far more quickly. However, they depend on the functioning of, and communication with, the GPS satellites, which might be disrupted by an electronic attack or by the effects of a severe solar storm. Gyrocompasses remain in use for military purposes (especially in submarines, where magnetic and GPS compasses are useless), but have been largely superseded by GPS compasses, with magnetic backups, in civilian contexts.

<text>In geometry, two figures or objects are congruent if they have the same shape and size, or if one has the same shape and size as the mirror image of the other.

More formally, two sets of points are called congruent if, and only if, one can be transformed into the other by an isometry, i.e., a combination of rigid motions, namely a translation, a rotation, and a reflection. This means that either object can be repositioned and reflected (but not resized) so as to coincide precisely with the other object. Therefore, two distinct plane figures on a piece of paper are congruent if they can be cut out and then matched up completely. Turning the paper over is permitted.

In elementary geometry the word &quot;congruent&quot; is often used as follows. The word &quot;equal&quot; is often used in place of &quot;congruent&quot; for these objects.
*Two line segments are congruent if they have the same length. 
*Two angles are congruent if they have the same measure.
*Two circles are congruent if they have the same diameter.
In this sense, the sentence &quot;two plane figures are congruent&quot; implies that their corresponding characteristics are &quot;congruent&quot; (or equal) including not just their corresponding sides and angles, but also their corresponding diagonals, perimeters, and areas.

The related concept of &quot;similarity&quot; applies if the objects have the same shape but do not necessarily have the same size. (Most definitions consider congruence to be a form of similarity, although a minority require that the objects have different sizes in order to qualify as similar.)

==Determining congruence of polygons==
For two polygons to be congruent, they must have an equal number of sides (and hence an equal number—the same number—of vertices). Two polygons with &quot;n&quot; sides are congruent if and only if they each have numerically identical sequences (even if clockwise for one polygon and counterclockwise for the other) side-angle-side-angle-... for &quot;n&quot; sides and &quot;n&quot; angles.

Congruence of polygons can be established graphically as follows:

*First, match and label the corresponding vertices of the two figures.
*Second, draw a vector from one of the vertices of one of the figures to the corresponding vertex of the other figure. &quot;Translate&quot; the first figure by this vector so that these two vertices match.
*Third, &quot;rotate&quot; the translated figure about the matched vertex until one pair of corresponding sides matches.
*Fourth, &quot;reflect&quot; the rotated figure about this matched side until the figures match.

If at any time the step cannot be completed, the polygons are not congruent.

==Congruence of triangles==
Two triangles are congruent if their corresponding sides are equal in length, and their corresponding angles are equal in measure.

Symbolically, we write the congruency and incongruency of two triangles and as follows:

:formula_1
:formula_2
In many cases it is sufficient to establish the equality of three corresponding parts and use one of the following results to deduce the congruence of the two triangles.

===Determining congruence===
Sufficient evidence for congruence between two triangles in Euclidean space can be shown through the following comparisons:

*SAS (side-angle-side): If two pairs of sides of two triangles are equal in length, and the included angles are equal in measurement, then the triangles are congruent.
*SSS (side-side-side): If three pairs of sides of two triangles are equal in length, then the triangles are congruent.
*ASA (angle-side-angle): If two pairs of angles of two triangles are equal in measurement, and the included sides are equal in length, then the triangles are congruent.

The ASA postulate is attributed to Thales of Miletus. In most systems of axioms, the three criteria – SAS, SSS and ASA – are established as theorems. In the School Mathematics Study Group system SAS is taken as one (#15) of 22 postulates.

*AAS (angle-angle-side): If two pairs of angles of two triangles are equal in measurement, and a pair of corresponding non-included sides are equal in length, then the triangles are congruent. AAS is equivalent to an ASA condition, by the fact that if any two angles are given, so is the third angle, since their sum should be 180°. ASA and AAS are sometimes combined into a single condition, AAcorrS – any two angles and a corresponding side.
*RHS (right-angle-hypotenuse-side), also known as HL (hypotenuse-leg): If two right-angled triangles have their hypotenuses equal in length, and a pair of other sides are equal in length, then the triangles are congruent.

====Side-side-angle====
The SSA condition (side-side-angle) which specifies two sides and a non-included angle (also known as ASS, or angle-side-side) does not by itself prove congruence. In order to show congruence, additional information is required such as the measure of the corresponding angles and in some cases the lengths of the two pairs of corresponding sides. There are a few possible cases:

If two triangles satisfy the SSA condition and the length of the side opposite the angle is greater than or equal to the length of the adjacent side (SSA, or long side-short side-angle), then the two triangles are congruent. The opposite side is sometimes longer when the corresponding angles are acute, but it is &quot;always&quot; longer when the corresponding angles are right or obtuse. Where the angle is a right angle, also known as the hypotenuse-leg (HL) postulate or the right-angle-hypotenuse-side (RHS) condition, the third side can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem thus allowing the SSS postulate to be applied.

If two triangles satisfy the SSA condition and the corresponding angles are acute and the length of the side opposite the angle is equal to the length of the adjacent side multiplied by the sine of the angle, then the two triangles are congruent.

If two triangles satisfy the SSA condition and the corresponding angles are acute and the length of the side opposite the angle is greater than the length of the adjacent side multiplied by the sine of the angle (but less than the length of the adjacent side), then the two triangles cannot be shown to be congruent. This is the ambiguous case and two different triangles can be formed from the given information, but further information distinguishing them can lead to a proof of congruence.

====Angle-angle-angle====
In Euclidean geometry, AAA (angle-angle-angle) (or just AA, since in Euclidean geometry the angles of a triangle add up to 180°) does not provide information regarding the size of the two triangles and hence proves only similarity and not congruence in Euclidean space.

However, in spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry (where the sum of the angles of a triangle varies with size) AAA is sufficient for congruence on a given curvature of surface.

=== CPCTC===
This acronym stands for &quot;Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles are Congruent&quot;, which is an abbreviated version of the definition of congruent triangles.
In more detail, it is a succinct way to say that if triangles and are congruent, that is,

:formula_3

with corresponding pairs of angles at vertices and ; and ; and and , and with corresponding pairs of sides and ; and ; and and , then the following statements are true:

:formula_4
:formula_5
:formula_6
:formula_7
:formula_8
:formula_9

The statement is often used as a justification in elementary geometry proofs when a conclusion of the congruence of parts of two triangles is needed after the congruence of the triangles has been established. For example, if two triangles have been shown to be congruent by the &quot;SSS&quot; criteria and a statement that corresponding angles are congruent is needed in a proof, then CPCTC may be used as a justification of this statement.

A related theorem is CPCFC, in which &quot;triangles&quot; is replaced with &quot;figures&quot; so that the theorem applies to any pair of polygons or polyhedrons that are congruent.

==Definition of congruence in analytic geometry==
In a Euclidean system, congruence is fundamental; it is the counterpart of equality for numbers. In analytic geometry, congruence may be defined intuitively thus: two mappings of figures onto one Cartesian coordinate system are congruent if and only if, for &quot;any&quot; two points in the first mapping, the Euclidean distance between them is equal to the Euclidean distance between the corresponding points in the second mapping.

A more formal definition states that two subsets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; of Euclidean space R&quot;n&quot; are called congruent if there exists an isometry &quot;f&quot; : R&quot;n&quot; → R&quot;n&quot; (an element of the Euclidean group &quot;E&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) with &quot;f&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) = &quot;B&quot;. Congruence is an equivalence relation.

==Congruent conic sections==

Two conic sections are congruent if their eccentricities and one other distinct parameter characterizing them are equal. Their eccentricities establish their shapes, equality of which is sufficient to establish similarity, and the second parameter then establishes size. Since two circles, parabolas, or rectangular hyperbolas always have the same eccentricity (specifically 0 in the case of circles, 1 in the case of parabolas, and formula_10 in the case of rectangular hyperbolas), two circles, parabolas, or rectangular hyperbolas need to have only one other common parameter value, establishing their size, for them to be congruent.

==Congruent polyhedra==

For two polyhedra with the same combinatorial type (that is, the same 
number &quot;E&quot; of edges, the same number of faces, and the same number of sides on corresponding faces), there exists a set of &quot;E&quot; measurements that can establish whether or not the polyhedra are congruent.
The number is tight, meaning that less than &quot;E&quot; measurements are not enough if the polyhedra are generic among their combinatorial type. But less measurements can work for special cases. For example, cubes have 12 edges, but 9 measurements are enough to decide if a polyhedron of that combinatorial type is congruent to a given regular cube.

==Congruent triangles on a sphere==
As with plane triangles, on a sphere two triangles sharing the same sequence of angle-side-angle (ASA) are necessarily congruent (that is, they have three identical sides and three identical angles). This can be seen as follows: One can situate one of the vertices with a given angle at the south pole and run the side with given length up the prime meridian. Knowing both angles at either end of the segment of fixed length ensures that the other two sides emanate with a uniquely determined trajectory, and thus will meet each other at a uniquely determined point; thus ASA is valid.

The congruence theorems side-angle-side (SAS) and side-side-side (SSS) also hold on a sphere; in addition, if two spherical triangles have an identical angle-angle-angle (AAA) sequence, they are congruent (unlike for plane triangles).

The plane-triangle congruence theorem angle-angle-side (AAS) does not hold for spherical triangles. As in plane geometry, side-side-angle (SSA) does not imply congruence.

== Notation ==
A symbol commonly used for congruence is an equals symbol with a tilde above it, , corresponding to the Unicode character &#x27;approximately equal to&#x27; (U+2245). In the UK, the three-bar equal sign &quot;&quot; (U+2261) is sometimes used.

<text>Stigmata (, plural of , &#x27;mark, spot, brand&#x27;), in Catholicism, are bodily wounds, scars and pain which appear in locations corresponding to the crucifixion wounds of Jesus Christ: the hands, wrists, feet, near the heart, the head (from the crown of thorns), and back (from carrying the cross and scourging).

St. Francis of Assisi is widely considered the first recorded stigmatic. For over fifty years, St. Padre Pio of Pietrelcina of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin reported stigmata which were studied by several 20th-century physicians. Stigmatics are primarily a Roman Catholic phenomenon; the Eastern Orthodox Church professes no official view on them.

A high percentage (probably over 80%) of all stigmatics are women. In his book &quot;Stigmata: A Medieval Phenomenon in a Modern Age&quot;, Ted Harrison suggests that there is no single mechanism whereby the marks of stigmata were produced. What is important is that the marks are recognised by others as of religious significance. Most cases of stigmata have been the result of trickery. Some cases have also included reportings of a mysterious chalice in visions being given to stigmatics to drink from or the feeling of a sharp sword being driven into one&#x27;s chest.

==Description==
An individual bearing the wounds of stigmata is a stigmatist or a stigmatic. In , Saint Paul says:

From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.

A () is a mark on the skin.

Reported cases of stigmata take various forms. Many show some or all Five Sacred Wounds that were, according to the Bible, inflicted on Jesus during his crucifixion: wounds in the wrists and feet, from nails; and in the side, from a lance. Some stigmatics display wounds to the forehead similar to those caused by the crown of thorns. Stigmata as crown of thorns appearing in the 20th century, e.g. on Marie Rose Ferron, have been repeatedly photographed. Other reported forms include tears of blood or sweating blood, and wounds to the back as from scourging.

Many stigmata show recurring bleeding that stops and then starts, at times after receiving Holy Communion; a significant proportion of stigmatics have shown a strong desire to receive Holy Communion frequently. A relatively high percentage of stigmatics also exhibit inedia, claiming to live with minimal (or no) food or water for long periods of time, except for the Holy Eucharist. Some exhibit weight loss, and closer investigation often reveals evidence of fakery.

Some stigmatics claim to feel the pain of wounds with no external marks; these are referred to as &quot;invisible stigmata&quot;. Some stigmatics&#x27; wounds do not appear to clot, and seem to stay fresh and uninfected. The blood from the wounds is said, in some cases, to have a pleasant, perfumed odor, known as the Odour of Sanctity.

Individuals who have obtained the stigmata are many times described as ecstatics, overwhelmed with emotions upon receiving the stigmata.

In his paper &quot;Hospitality and Pain&quot;, Christian theologian Ivan Illich states: &quot;Compassion with Christ ... is faith so strong and so deeply incarnate that it leads to the individual embodiment of the contemplated pain.&quot; His thesis is that stigmata result from exceptional poignancy of religious faith and desire to associate oneself with the suffering Messiah.

Differently from the Five Holy Wounds of Christ, some mystics like Francis of Assisi and father Pio of Petralcina reported a spontaneous regression and closure of their stigmata in the days following their death. Both of them claimed to have received the divine stigmata in their hands as well as in their feet.

==Specific cases==

===Saint Ansbert of Rouen===

Earlier reports of stigmatics do exist, however there is a lack of consensus on how the concept of stigmata was understood pre-Saint Francis. St. Ansbert of Rouen (d. 695 AD) could be considered the earliest stigmatic due to the claims of witnesses following his death:

&quot;When they had opened his tomb and they thought his body would stink because of the amount of time that had elapsed since it had been buried, such a sweet fragrant odor like a diversity of flowers flowed forth, and the whole church was filled with little drops of balsam. And when the brothers who had come to see him from the neighboring province... removed the clothes in which he had been buried because they wanted to change them wishing to dress him in new clothes, they found on his forearms the sign of the dominical cross, bearing the likeness of a red color. It was evident to all the faithful that this was given to be understood that while he lived he bore the arms of Christ in his heart, therefore, Christ&#x27;s stigmata were revealed on the body of the dead man.&quot;

===Saint Francis of Assisi===

St. Francis of Assisi is widely considered the first recorded stigmatic in Christian history. In 1224, two years before his death, he embarked on a journey to Mount La Verna for a forty-day fast. The legend states that one morning, near the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, a six-winged angel appeared to Francis while he prayed. As the angel approached, Francis could see that the angel was crucified. He was humbled by the sight, and his heart was filled with elation joined by pain and suffering. When the angel departed, Francis was left with wounds in his hands, feet, and side as if caused by the same lance that pierced Christ&#x27;s side. The image of nails immediately appeared in his hands and feet, and the wound in his side often seeped blood. Pope Alexander IV and other witnesses declared that they had seen these marks both before and after his death. In traditional artistic depictions of the incident, Francis is accompanied by a Franciscan brother.

St. Francis&#x27; first biographer, Thomas of Celano, reports the event in his 1230 &quot;First Life of St. Francis&quot;:

When the blessed servant of God saw these things he was filled with wonder, but he did not know what the vision meant. He rejoiced greatly in the benign and gracious expression with which he saw himself regarded by the seraph, whose beauty was indescribable; yet he was alarmed by the fact that the seraph was affixed to the cross and was suffering terribly. Thus Francis rose, one might say, sad and happy, joy and grief alternating in him. He wondered anxiously what this vision could mean, and his soul was uneasy as it searched for understanding. And as his understanding sought in vain for an explanation and his heart was filled with perplexity at the great novelty of this vision, the marks of nails began to appear in his hands and feet, just as he had seen them slightly earlier in the crucified man above him.

His wrists and feet seemed to be pierced by nails, with the heads of the nails appearing on his wrists and on the upper sides of his feet, the points appearing on the other side. The marks were round on the palm of each hand but elongated on the other side, and small pieces of flesh jutting out from the rest took on the appearance of the nail-ends, bent and driven back. In the same way the marks of nails were impressed on his feet and projected beyond the rest of the flesh. Moreover, his right side had a large wound as if it had been pierced with a spear, and it often bled so that his tunic and trousers were soaked with his sacred blood.
From the records of St. Francis&#x27; physical ailments and symptoms, Edward Frederick Hartung concluded in 1935 that he knew what health problems plagued St. Francis. Hartung believed that he had an eye ailment known as trachoma and quartan malaria.

Quartan malaria infects the liver, spleen, and stomach, causing the victim intense pain. One complication of quartan malaria occasionally seen around Francis&#x27; time is known as purpura, a purple hemorrhage of blood into the skin. According to Hartung &quot;If this were the case of St. Francis, he would have been afflicted by &quot;ecchymoses&quot;, an exceedingly large &quot;purpura&quot;. The purple spots of blood may have been punctured while in the wilderness and there appear as an open wound like that of Christ.&quot;

A later medical hypothesis was proposed in 1987 to explain the wounds, it claimed that St. Francis may have contracted leprosy.

===Saint Padre Pio of Pietrelcina===

For over fifty years, Padre Pio of Pietrelcina reported stigmata which were studied by several 20th-century physicians, whose independence from the Church is not known.
The observations were reportedly inexplicable and the wounds never became infected. His wounds healed once, but reappeared. The wounds were examined by Luigi Romanelli, chief physician of the City Hospital of Barletta, for about one year. The physician Angelo Maria Merla noted that the wounds were not tubercular in origin but could not make an official diagnosis without further tests. The surgeon Giorgio Festa, a private practitioner, also examined them in 1920 and 1925. Professor Giuseppe Bastianelli, physician to Pope Benedict XV, examined the wounds, but no report of his examinations was made. Pathologist Amico Bignami of the University of Rome also observed the wounds, describing them as shallow. Festa, who had originally agreed with Bignami, later described the wounds as superficial when covered with a scab. Giorgio Festa noted that &quot;at the edges of the lesions, the skin is perfectly normal and does not show any sign of edema, of penetration, or of redness, even when examined with a good magnifying glass&quot;. Alberto Caserta took X-rays of the hands in 1954 and found no abnormality in the bone structure. Giuseppe Sala who worked as a physician for Pio between 1956 and 1968 commented that tests revealed his blood had no signs of abnormality.

There were both religious and non-religious critics who accused Padre Pio of faking his stigmata, saying he used carbolic acid to make the wounds. The historian Sergio Luzzatto recounted that in 1919, Maria De Vito (the cousin of the local pharmacist Valentini Vista at Foggia) testified that the young Pio bought carbolic acid and the great quantity of four grams of veratrine &quot;without presenting any medical prescription whatsoever&quot;. Pio maintained that the carbolic acid was used to sterilize syringes used for medical treatments and that after being subjected to a practical joke where veratrine was mixed with snuff tobacco, causing uncontrollable sneezing after ingestion, he decided to acquire his own quantity of the substance in order to play the same joke on his confreres.

Amico Bignami in a report wrote that the wounds were caused by &quot;neurotic necrosis&quot;. He suggested they had been inflicted unconsciously by suggestion and artificially maintained by iodine that Pio had used as a disinfectant. In 1922, physician Agostino Gemelli went to visit Padre Pio, but Gemelli was denied the right to examine the stigmata without an authorization from the Holy Office. Gemelli irritated and offended for not being allowed to examine the stigmata, wrote that Pio was a hysteric and his stigmata were self-induced, not of supernatural origin. Gemelli also speculated that his wounds were kept open with carbolic acid. Giorgio Festa, who examined the stigmata of the friar on October 28, 1919, wrote in his report that they &quot;are not the product of a trauma of external origin, nor are they due to the application of potently irritating chemicals&quot;.

Throughout his life, Pio had hidden his wounds by wearing fingerless gloves. At death there were no wounds, only &quot;unblemished skin&quot;.

===Mariam Thresia Chiramel===
The first saint from India with stigmata was nun Mariam Thresia Chiramel. She was canonised on 13 October 2019 by Pope Francis.

== Stigmata and gender ==

In the late nineteenth century, a French physician named Dr. An Imbert-Goubeyre began compiling a census of known stigmatics from the thirteenth century to his own time. This census includes 280 female and 41 male stigmatics, meaning women comprise a little over 87% of the list. Additionally, the University of Antwerp released a database of information on 244 stigmatics in April 2019. 92% of the stigmatics in the database are female. In some cases, convent sisters have attempted to shield stigmatic women from public scrutiny, often out of fear of how their condition would affect the convent&#x27;s reputation. So, the number of women stigmatics may be even higher than historical record shows.

Despite the high number of women stigmatics throughout history, the best-known and least contested stigmatics, such as Francis of Assisi and Padre Pio, have been men.

==Scientific research==
Many stigmatics have been exposed for using trickery. Magdalena de la Cruz, for example, confessed before she died that her stigmata was deliberate deception.

Early neurologist Désiré-Magloire Bourneville published works which stated that saints claiming to produce miracles or stigmata, and those claiming to be possessed, were actually suffering from epilepsy or hysteria. Some modern research has indicated stigmata are of hysterical origin or linked to dissociative identity disorder.

There is a link between dietary constriction by self-starvation, dissociative mental states and self-mutilation, in the context of a religious belief. Anorexia nervosa cases often display self-mutilation similar to stigmata as part of a ritualistic, obsessive–compulsive disorder. A relationship between starvation and self-mutilation has been reported amongst prisoners of war and during famines.

The psychologist Leonard Zusne in his book &quot;Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking&quot; (1989) has written:

In his &quot;Stigmata: A Medieval Phenomenon in a Modern Age&quot;, Ted Harrison suggests that there is no single mechanism whereby the marks of stigmata were produced. Harrison found no evidence from a study of contemporary cases that the marks were supernatural in origin. He concluded, however, that marks of natural origin need not be hoaxes. Some stigmatics marked themselves in attempt to suffer with Christ as a form of piety. Others marked themselves accidentally and their marks were noted as stigmata by witnesses. Often marks of human origin produced profound and genuine religious responses.

Harrison also noted that after Saint Francis of Assisi, the stigmata was &quot;seen as a predominantly female experience&quot; with the female-to-male ratio of stigmatics being 7 to 1. Those men that were stigmatic were non-ordained, including Saint Francis. Harrison argues that in many cases the stigmata was a consequence of the intense personal mystical ministries practiced by those excluded from the priesthood. Only in the twentieth century have cases of stigmatic priests appeared.

One suggestion is that painful bruising syndrome may explain rare cases of non self-induced stigmata.

Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell, who investigated recent cases of stigmata such as Katya Rivas, commented that they are indistinguishable from hoaxing.

In 2002, a psychoanalytic study of stigmatic Therese Neumann suggested her stigmata resulted from post-traumatic stress symptoms expressed in unconscious self-mutilation through abnormal autosuggestibility.

According to a study of the French theologian Joachim Bouflet, in the 21st century there were 200 stigmatics all over the world. Most of them reached the third age without having particular health problems. The oldest stigmatic was Marie-July Jahenny who died in 1941 at the age of 91. As of 1997, the stigmatics who had been declared saints by the Roman Catholic Church were only 7.

==Non-Christian stigmata==

Among the Warao of the Orinoco Delta, a contemplator of tutelary spirits may mystically induce the development of &quot;...(imagined) openings in the palms of his hands.&quot;

Buddhist &quot;stigmata&quot; are regularly indicated in Buddhist art.

Some spiritualist mediums have also produced stigmata. During the séances of German medium Maria Vollhardt, it was alleged that bleeding wounds appeared. However, Albert Moll, a psychiatrist, considered her phenomena to be fraudulent.

<text>Hubert Languet (1518 – 30 September 1581, in Antwerp) was a French diplomat and reformer. The leading idea of his diplomacy was that of religious and civil liberty for the protection and expansion of Protestantism. He did everything in his power to advance the union of the Protestant churches.

==Life==

Languet was born in 1518 in Vitteaux, France, located west of Dijon, France.

He entered the University of Poitiers in order to study law but he was interested also in theology, history, and science and political science. He visited the universities of Padua and Bologna, and traveled in Italy and Spain.

Languet was greatly influenced by Melanchthon&#x27;s &quot;Loci theologici,&quot; which put an end to his doubts. In 1549 Languet went to Wittenberg, where he was kindly received by Melanchthon as a guest, frequently accompanying him on his travels and being on intimate terms with his friends. Expelled from France by the persecutions of the Protestants, he settled at Wittenberg, spending the winters there, but making extensive journeys in the summer and autumn.

In 1559 Languet, on the recommendation of Melanchthon, entered the service of the elector of Saxony as diplomatic agent, which position he held until 1577. The elector sent him to various courts: to Paris, Vienna, Prague, Frankfurt, Cologne, and the Netherlands.

As a friend of Melanchthon he opposed the growing party of strict Lutherans; but still he did everything in his power to reconcile the opposing parties, even trying to effect the recognition of the French Huguenots at the diet of Frankfurt in 1562, but without success. In May 1561, Languet went to France in order to bring about a closer connection between the German princes and the French Protestants, and was present at the Religious Conference of Poissy. In 1562 Languet was in Antwerp; the following years were spent in diplomatic journeys to France and back to Saxony.

In 1571 the elector sent Languet together with the ambassadors of other Protestant princes of Germany to King Charles IX of France to congratulate him on the Peace of Saint Germain. On this occasion Languet advocated the equal recognition of both confessions, but the answer was the St Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre; having narrowly escaped death, he left France in October 1572, and returned there only once more, shortly before his death.

From 1573 to 1576 Languet was at the court of Emperor Maximilian II, whom he accompanied on his various journeys. With the death of Maximilian II in 1576 his connection with the court of Vienna was dissolved. The bitter feelings against him as the friend of Melanchthon and a Calvinist caused him to ask for dismissal from the court. The elector granted his desire, but continued his salary. In 1577 he went to Cologne in order to be nearer to the Netherlands, as he was greatly attracted by William of Orange.

== Works ==

Hubert Languet is one possible candidate for the authorship of the influential Huguenot pamphlet, &quot;Vindiciae contra tyrannos&quot; (1579). The book is divided into four parts each of which proposes and answers a question:
#Must God in a case of dispute be obeyed rather than a ruler? 
#May a ruler who violates the law of God and devastates the Church, be opposed? 
#How far, and with what right may it be allowed to oppose a ruler who suppresses or destroys the state? 
#Have neighboring rulers a right to assist the subjects oppressed by his ruler?

<text>An injunction is an equitable remedy in the form of a special court order compelling a party to do or refrain from doing certain acts. It was developed by the English courts of equity but its origins go back to Roman law and the equitable remedy of the &quot;interdict&quot;.

&quot;When a court employs the extraordinary remedy of injunction, it directs the conduct of a party, and does so with the backing of its full coercive powers.&quot; A party that fails to comply with an injunction faces criminal or civil penalties, including possible monetary sanctions and even imprisonment. They can also be charged with contempt of court. 

==Rationale==
The injunction is an equitable remedy that was created by the English courts of equity. Like other equitable remedies, it has traditionally been given when a wrong cannot be effectively remedied by an award of money damages. (The doctrine that reflects this is the requirement that an injunction can be given only when there is &quot;no adequate remedy at law.&quot;) Injunctions are intended to make whole again someone whose rights have been violated. Nevertheless, when deciding whether to grant an injunction, courts also take into account the interests of non-parties (that is, the public interest). When deciding whether to give an injunction, and deciding what its scope should be, courts give special attention to questions of fairness and good faith. One manifestation of this is that injunctions are subject to equitable defenses, such as laches and unclean hands.

Injunctions are given in many different kinds of cases. They can prohibit future violations of the law, such as trespass to real property, infringement of a patent, or the violation of a constitutional right (e.g., the free exercise of religion). Or they can require the defendant to repair past violations of the law.

An injunction can require someone to do something, like clean up an oil spill or remove a spite fence. Or it can prohibit someone from doing something, like using an illegally obtained trade secret. An injunction that requires conduct is called a &quot;mandatory injunction.&quot; An injunction that prohibits conduct is called a &quot;prohibitory injunction.&quot; Many injunctions are both—that is, they have both mandatory and prohibitory components, because they require some conduct and forbid other conduct.

When an injunction is given, it can be enforced with equitable enforcement mechanisms such as contempt. It can also be modified or dissolved (upon a proper motion to the court) if circumstances change in the future. These features of the injunction allow a court granting one to manage the behavior of the parties. That is the most important distinction between the injunction and another non-monetary remedy in American law, the declaratory judgment. Another way these two remedies are distinguished is that the declaratory judgment is sometimes available at an earlier point in a dispute than the injunction.

==Worldwide==

===Australia===

In the state of New South Wales, a court may grant an apprehended violence order (AVO) to a person who fears violence, harassment, abuse, or stalking. The order prohibits the defendant from assaulting, harassing, threatening, stalking, or intimidating the person seeking the order. Other conditions may be included, such as a prohibition against contacting the person or attempting to find the person online. A court may issue the order if it believes a person has reasonable grounds for their fears or has no reasonable grounds for their fears. Non-compliance may result in the imposition of a fine, imprisonment, or both, and deportation.

=== Turkey ===

Interim injunctions are a provisional form of injunctive relief, which can compel a party to do something (mandatory injunction) or stop it from doing something (prohibitory injunction).

A plaintiff seeking an interim injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer severe harm in the absence of preliminary relief, and that an injunction is in the public interest.

In Turkish law, interim injunction is an extraordinary remedy that is never awarded as of right. In each case, courts balance the competing claims of injury and consider the likely hardship on the defendant.

===United States===

====History====
Injunctions have been especially important at two moments in American history.

First, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, federal courts used injunctions to break strikes by unions. For example, after the United States government successfully used an injunction to outlaw the Pullman boycott in 1894 in &quot;In re Debs&quot;, employers found that they could obtain federal court injunctions to ban strikes and organizing activities of all kinds by unions. These injunctions were often extremely broad; one injunction issued by a federal court in the 1920s effectively barred the United Mine Workers of America from talking to workers who had signed yellow dog contracts with their employers. Unable to limit what they called &quot;government by injunction&quot; in the courts, labor and its allies persuaded the United States Congress in 1932 to pass the Norris-LaGuardia Act, which imposed so many procedural and substantive limits on the federal courts&#x27; power to issue injunctions that it effectively prohibited federal court from issuing injunctions in cases arising out of labor disputes. A number of states followed suit and enacted &quot;Little Norris-LaGuardia Acts&quot; that imposed similar limitations on state courts&#x27; powers. The courts have since recognized a limited exception to the Norris-LaGuardia Act&#x27;s strict limitations in those cases in which a party seeks injunctive relief to enforce the grievance arbitration provisions of a collective bargaining agreement.

Second, injunctions were crucial to the second half of the twentieth century in the desegregation of American schools. Federal courts gave injunctions that carried out the command of &quot;Brown v Board of Education&quot; to integrate public schools in the United States, and at times courts took over the management of public schools in order to ensure compliance. (An injunction that puts a court in the position of taking over and administering an institution—such as a school, a prison, or a hospital—is often called a &quot;structural injunction&quot;.)

Injunctions remain widely used to require government officials to comply with the Constitution, and they are also frequently used in private law disputes about intellectual property, real property, and contracts. Many state and federal statutes, including environmental statutes, civil rights statutes and employment-discrimination statutes, are enforced with injunctions.

In &quot;Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc.&quot; (1999), the Supreme Court stated that the scope of federal injunctive relief is constrained by the limits on equitable remedies that existed in the English Court of Chancery around 1789.

====Forms====
Injunctions in the United States tend to come in three main forms: temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions. For both temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions, the goal is usually to preserve the status quo until the court is able to decide the case.

=====Temporary restraining orders=====
A special kind of injunction that may be issued before trial is called a &quot;temporary restraining order&quot; or TRO. A TRO may be issued without notice to the other party or a hearing. A TRO will be given only for a short period of time before a court can schedule a hearing at which the restrained person may appear and contest the order. If the TRO is contested, the court must decide whether to issue a preliminary injunction. Temporary restraining orders are often, but not exclusively, given to prevent domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault, or harassment.

=====Preliminary injunctions=====
Preliminary injunctions are given before trial. Because they are issued at an early stage, before the court has heard the evidence and made a decision in the case, they are more rarely given. The requirements for a preliminary injunction tend to be the same as for a permanent injunction, with the additional requirement that the party asking for the injunction is likely to succeed on the merits.

=====Permanent injunctions=====
Permanent injunctions are issued after trial. Different federal and state courts sometimes have slightly different requirements for obtaining a permanent injunction. The Supreme Court enumerated the traditional four-factor test in &quot;eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C.&quot; as:
# the plaintiff has suffered irreparable injury;
# remedies available at law are inadequate to compensate that injury;
# considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and
# the public interest would not be disserved by an injunction.

The balance of hardships inquiry is also sometimes called the &quot;undue hardship defense&quot;. A stay pending appeal is a mechanism allowing a losing party to delay enforcement of an injunction while appeal is pending after final judgment has been granted by a lower court.

====Antitrust====

The DOJ and the FTC have investigated patent holders in the United States for seeking preliminary injunctions against accused infringers of standard-essential patents, or patents that the patent holder must license on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. There is an ongoing debate among legal and economic scholars with major implications for antitrust policy in the United States as well as in other countries over the statutory limits to the patent holder&#x27;s right to seek and obtain injunctive relief against infringers of standard-essential patents. Citing concerns of the absence of competition facing the patent holder once its technology is locked-in to the standard, some scholars argue that the holder of a standard-essential patent should face antitrust liability when seeking an injunction against an implementer of a standard. Other scholars assert that patent holders are not contractually restrained from pursuing injunctions for standard-essential patent claims and that patent law is already capable of determining whether an injunction against an infringer of standard-essential patents will impose a net cost on consumers, thus obviating the role of antitrust enforcement.

===United Kingdom===
====Interim injunctions====
Interim injunctions or interim orders are granted as a means of providing interim relief while a case is being heard, to prevent actions being implemented which potentially may be barred by a final ruling.

====Super-injunctions====

In England and Wales, injunctions whose existence and details may not be legally reported, in addition to facts or allegations which may not be disclosed, have been issued; they have been informally dubbed &quot;super-injunctions&quot;.

An example was the super-injunction raised in September 2009 by Carter-Ruck solicitors on behalf of oil trader Trafigura, prohibiting the reporting of an internal Trafigura report into the 2006 Ivory Coast toxic waste dump scandal. The existence of the super-injunction was revealed only when it was referred to in a parliamentary question that was subsequently circulated on the Internet (parliamentary privilege protects statements by MPs in Parliament which would otherwise be held to be in contempt of court). Before it could be challenged in court, the injunction was varied to permit reporting of the question. By long legal tradition, parliamentary proceedings may be reported without restriction. Parliamentary proceedings are covered by absolute privilege, but the reporting of those proceedings in newspapers is only covered by qualified privilege. Another example of the use of a super-injunction was in a libel case in which a plaintiff who claimed he was defamed by family members in a dispute over a multimillion-pound family trust obtained anonymity for himself and for his relatives.

Roy Greenslade credits the former editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Alan Rusbridger, with coining the word &quot;super-injunction&quot; in an article about the Trafigura affair in September 2009.

The term &quot;hyper-injunction&quot; has also been used to describe an injunction similar to a super-injunction but also including an order that the injunction must not be discussed with members of Parliament, journalists, or lawyers. One known hyper-injunction was obtained at the High Court in 2006, preventing its subject from saying that paint used in water tanks on passenger ships can break down and release potentially toxic chemicals. This example became public knowledge in Parliament under parliamentary privilege.

By May 2011, &quot;Private Eye&quot; claimed to be aware of 53 super-injunctions and anonymised privacy injunctions,&lt;ref name=&quot;PE1288/5&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; though Lord Neuberger&#x27;s report into the use of super-injunctions revealed that only two super-injunctions had been granted since January 2010. Many media sources were wrongly describing all gagging orders as super-injunctions. The widespread media coverage of super-injunctions led to a drop in numbers after 2011; however four were granted in the first five months of 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;PE1393/9&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
==== Dynamic Injunction ====
Injunctions defined by the European Commission as injunctions which can be issued for instance in cases in which materially the same website becomes available immediately after issuing the injunction with a different IP address or URL and which is drafted in a way that allows to also cover the new IP address or URL without the need for a new judicial procedure to obtain a new injunction.

==== Live Blocking Injunction ====
An injunction described by the European Commission as allowing the repeated blocking of a website every time a live broadcast is in progress. These injunctions are generally used during live sporting events.

<doc id="39345" wikidata="Q201732" url="?curid=39345" title="Robert Graves">
<text>Captain Robert von Ranke Graves (24 July 1895 – 7 December 1985) was an English poet, soldier, historical novelist and critic. His father was Alfred Perceval Graves, a celebrated Irish poet and figure in the Gaelic revival; they were both Celticists and students of Irish mythology.

Robert Graves produced more than 140 works in his lifetime. His poems, his translations and innovative analysis of the Greek myths, his memoir of his early life—including his role in World War I—&quot;Good-Bye to All That&quot; (1929), and his speculative study of poetic inspiration &quot;The White Goddess&quot; have never been out of print. He was also a renowned short story writer, with stories such as &quot;The Tenement&quot; still being popular today.

He earned his living from writing, particularly popular historical novels such as &quot;I, Claudius&quot;; &quot;King Jesus&quot;; &quot;The Golden Fleece&quot;; and &quot;Count Belisarius&quot;. He also was a prominent translator of Classical Latin and Ancient Greek texts; his versions of &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot; and &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; remain popular for their clarity and entertaining style. Graves was awarded the 1934 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for both &quot;I, Claudius&quot; and &quot;Claudius the God&quot;.

Graves&#x27;s eldest half-brother Philip achieved success as a journalist and his younger brother Charles was a writer and journalist.

==Early life==
Graves was born into a middle-class family in Wimbledon, then part of Surrey, now part of south London. He was the eighth of ten children born to Alfred Perceval Graves (1846–1931), who was the sixth child and second son of Charles Graves, Bishop of Limerick, Ardfert and Aghadoe. His father was an Irish school inspector, Gaelic scholar and the author of the popular song &quot;Father O&#x27;Flynn&quot;, and his mother was his father&#x27;s second wife, Amalie Elisabeth Sophie von Ranke (1857–1951), grandniece of the historian Leopold von Ranke. His uncle was the admiral commanding the Nore during World War I, Sir Richard Poore, 4th Baronet.

At the age of seven, double pneumonia following measles almost took Graves&#x27;s life, the first of three occasions when he was despaired of by his doctors as a result of afflictions of the lungs, the second being the result of a war wound and the third when he contracted Spanish influenza in late 1918, immediately before demobilisation.

At school, Graves was enrolled as Robert von Ranke Graves, and in Germany, his books are published under that name, but before and during the First World War the name caused him difficulties.

===Education===
Graves received his early education at a series of six preparatory schools, including King&#x27;s College School in Wimbledon, Penrallt in Wales, Hillbrow School in Rugby, Rokeby School in Wimbledon and Copthorne in Sussex, from which last in 1909 he won a scholarship to Charterhouse. There he began to write poetry and took up boxing, in due course becoming school champion at both welter- and middleweight. He claimed that this was in response to persecution because of the German element in his name, his outspokenness, his scholarly and moral seriousness, and his poverty relative to the other boys.

He also sang in the choir, meeting there an aristocratic boy three years younger, G. H. &quot;Peter&quot; Johnstone, with whom he began an intense romantic friendship, the scandal of which led ultimately to an interview with the headmaster. However, Graves himself called it &quot;chaste and sentimental&quot; and &quot;proto-homosexual,&quot; and though he was clearly in love with Peter (disguised by the name &quot;Dick&quot; in &quot;Good-Bye to All That&quot;), he denied that their relationship was ever sexual. He was warned about Peter&#x27;s proclivities by other contemporaries.

Among the masters, his chief influence was George Mallory, who introduced him to contemporary literature and took him mountaineering in the holidays. In his final year at Charterhouse, he won a classical exhibition to St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, but did not take his place there until after the war.

==First World War==
At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Graves enlisted almost immediately, taking a commission in the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers as a second lieutenant (on probation) on 12 August. He was confirmed in his rank on 10 March 1915, and received rapid promotion, being promoted to lieutenant on 5 May 1915 and to captain on 26 October. In August 1916 an officer who disliked him spread the rumour that he was the brother of a captured German spy who had assumed the name &quot;Karl Graves&quot;. The problem resurfaced in a minor way in the Second World War, when a suspicious rural policeman blocked his appointment to the Special Constabulary. 
He published his first volume of poems, &quot;Over the Brazier&quot;, in 1916. He developed an early reputation as a war poet and was one of the first to write realistic poems about the experience of frontline conflict. In later years, he omitted his war poems from his collections, on the grounds that they were too obviously &quot;part of the war poetry boom.&quot; On 20 July at High Wood during the Battle of the Somme, he was so badly wounded by a shell fragment through the lung that he was expected to die and was officially reported as having died of wounds. He gradually recovered and, apart from a brief spell back in France, spent the remainder of the war in England.

One of Graves&#x27;s friends at this time was the poet Siegfried Sassoon, a fellow officer in his regiment. They both convalesced at Somerville College, Oxford, which was used as a hospital for officers. &quot;How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies&#x27; College at Oxford,&quot; Sassoon wrote to him in 1917. At Somerville College, Graves met and fell in love with Marjorie, a nurse and professional pianist, but stopped writing to her once he learned she was engaged. About his time at Somerville, he wrote: &quot;I enjoyed my stay at Somerville. The sun shone, and the discipline was easy.&quot; In 1917, Sassoon rebelled against the conduct of the war by making a public anti-war statement. Graves feared Sassoon could face a court martial and intervened with the military authorities, persuading them that Sassoon was experiencing shell shock and that they should treat him accordingly. Sassoon was sent to Craiglockhart, a military hospital in Edinburgh, where he was treated by W. H. R. Rivers and met fellow patient Wilfred Owen. Graves was treated here as well. Graves also had shell shock, or neurasthenia as it was then called, but he was never hospitalised for it,

The friendship between Graves and Sassoon is documented in Graves&#x27;s letters and biographies. The intensity of their early relationship is demonstrated in Graves&#x27;s collection &quot;Fairies and Fusiliers&quot; (1917), which contains many poems celebrating their friendship. Sassoon remarked upon a &quot;heavy sexual element&quot; within it, an observation supported by the sentimental nature of much of the surviving correspondence between the two men. Through Sassoon, Graves became a friend of Wilfred Owen, &quot;who often used to send me poems from France&quot;.

In September 1917, Graves was seconded for duty with a garrison battalion. Graves&#x27;s army career ended dramatically with an incident which could have led to a charge of desertion. Having been posted to Limerick in late 1918, he &quot;woke up with a sudden chill, which I recognized as the first symptoms of Spanish influenza.&quot; &quot;I decided to make a run for it,&quot; he wrote, &quot;I should at least have my influenza in an English, and not an Irish, hospital.&quot; Arriving at Waterloo with a high fever but without the official papers that would secure his release from the army, he chanced to share a taxi with a demobilisation officer also returning from Ireland, who completed his papers for him with the necessary secret codes.

==Post-war life==

Immediately after the war, Graves with his wife, Nancy Nicholson had a growing family, but he was financially insecure and weakened physically and mentally:

In October 1919, he took up his place at the University of Oxford, soon changing course to English Language and Literature, though managing to retain his Classics exhibition. In consideration of his health, he was permitted to live a little outside Oxford, on Boars Hill, where the residents included Robert Bridges, John Masefield (his landlord), Edmund Blunden, Gilbert Murray and Robert Nichols. Later, the family moved to Worlds End Cottage on Collice Street, Islip, Oxfordshire.

His most notable Oxford companion was T. E. Lawrence, then a Fellow of All Souls, with whom he discussed contemporary poetry and shared in the planning of elaborate pranks. By this time, he had become an atheist. His work was part of the literature event in the art competition at the 1924 Summer Olympics.

While still an undergraduate he established a grocers shop on the outskirts of Oxford but the business soon failed. He also failed his BA degree but was exceptionally permitted to take in 1925 a Bachelor of Letters by dissertation instead, allowing him to pursue a teaching career.

In 1926, he took up a post as a professor of English Literature at Cairo University, accompanied by his wife, their children and the poet Laura Riding, with whom he was having an affair. Graves later claimed that one of his pupils at the university was a young Gamal Abdel Nasser, but this is obviously untrue as Nasser was only eight years old at the time.

He returned to London briefly, where he separated from his wife under highly emotional circumstances (and at one point Riding attempted suicide) before leaving to live with Riding in Deià, Majorca. There they continued to publish letterpress books under the rubric of the Seizin Press, founded and edited the literary journal, &quot;Epilogue&quot; and wrote two successful academic books together: &quot;A Survey of Modernist Poetry&quot; (1927) and &quot;A Pamphlet Against Anthologies&quot; (1928); both had great influence on modern literary criticism, particularly New Criticism.

==Literary career==
In 1927, Graves published &quot;Lawrence and the Arabs&quot;, a commercially successful biography of T. E. Lawrence. The autobiographical &quot;Good-Bye to All That&quot; (1929, revised by him and republished in 1957) proved a success but cost him many of his friends, notably Siegfried Sassoon. In 1934, he published his most commercially successful work, &quot;I, Claudius&quot;. Using classical sources (under the advice of classics scholar Eirlys Roberts) he constructed a complex and compelling tale of the life of the Roman emperor Claudius, a tale extended in the sequel &quot;Claudius the God&quot; (1935). &quot;I, Claudius&quot; received the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1934. Later, in the 1970s, the Claudius books were turned into the very popular television series &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, with Sir Derek Jacobi shown in both Britain and United States. Another historical novel by Graves, &quot;Count Belisarius&quot; (1938), recounts the career of the Byzantine general Belisarius.

Graves and Riding left Majorca in 1936 at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and in 1939, they moved to the United States, taking lodging in New Hope, Pennsylvania. Their volatile relationship and eventual breakup were described by Robert&#x27;s nephew Richard Perceval Graves in &quot;Robert Graves: 1927–1940: the Years with Laura&quot;, and T. S. Matthews&#x27;s &quot;Jacks or Better&quot; (1977). It was also the basis for Miranda Seymour&#x27;s novel &quot;The Summer of &#x27;39&quot; (1998).

After returning to Britain, Graves began a relationship with Beryl Hodge, the wife of Alan Hodge, his collaborator on &quot;The Long Week-End&quot; (1940) and &quot;The Reader Over Your Shoulder&quot; (1943; republished in 1947 as &quot;The Use and Abuse of the English Language&quot; but subsequently republished several times under its original title). Graves and Beryl (they were not to marry until 1950) lived in Galmpton, Torbay until 1946, when they re-established a home with their three children, in Deià, Majorca. The house is now a museum. The year 1946 also saw the publication of his historical novel &quot;King Jesus&quot;. He published &quot;The White Goddess: A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth&quot; in 1948; it is a study of the nature of poetic inspiration, interpreted in terms of the classical and Celtic mythology he knew so well. He turned to science fiction with &quot;Seven Days in New Crete&quot; (1949) and in 1953 he published &quot;The Nazarene Gospel Restored&quot; with Joshua Podro. He also wrote &quot;Hercules, My Shipmate&quot;, published under that name in 1945 (but first published as &quot;The Golden Fleece&quot; in 1944).

In 1955, he published &quot;The Greek Myths&quot;, which retells a large body of Greek myths, each tale followed by extensive commentary drawn from the system of &quot;The White Goddess&quot;. His retellings are well respected; many of his unconventional interpretations and etymologies are dismissed by classicists. Graves, in turn, dismissed the reactions of classical scholars, arguing that they are too specialised and &quot;prose-minded&quot; to interpret &quot;ancient poetic meaning,&quot; and that &quot;the few independent thinkers ... [are] the poets, who try to keep civilisation alive.&quot;

He published a volume of short stories, &quot;¡Catacrok! Mostly Stories, Mostly Funny&quot;, in 1956. In 1961, he became Professor of Poetry at Oxford, a post he held until 1966.

In 1967, Robert Graves published, together with Omar Ali-Shah, a new translation of the &quot;Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot;. The translation quickly became controversial; Graves was attacked for trying to break the spell of famed passages in Edward FitzGerald&#x27;s Victorian translation, and L. P. Elwell-Sutton, an orientalist at Edinburgh University, maintained that the manuscript used by Ali-Shah and Graves, which Ali-Shah and his brother Idries Shah claimed had been in their family for 800 years, was a forgery. The translation was a critical disaster and Graves&#x27;s reputation suffered severely due to what the public perceived as his gullibility in falling for the Shah brothers&#x27; deception. It was in 1967 that the first full-length assessment of Graves&#x27; work was published. &quot;Swifter Than Reason&quot; by Douglas Day concentrated on Grave&#x27;s development as a poet from his earliest work in 1916 to the most recent collection, using Graves&#x27; critical writings as commentary.

In 1968, Graves was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry by Queen Elizabeth II. His private audience with the Queen was shown in the BBC documentary film &quot;Royal Family&quot;, which aired in 1969.

From the 1960s until his death, Robert Graves frequently exchanged letters with Spike Milligan. Many of their letters to each other are collected in the book &quot;Dear Robert, Dear Spike&quot;.

==Sexuality==
Robert Graves was bisexual, having intense romantic relationships with both men and women, though the word he coined for it was &quot;pseudo-homosexual.&quot; Graves was raised to be &quot;prudishly innocent, as my mother had planned I should be.&quot; His mother, Amy, forbade speaking about sex, save in a &quot;gruesome&quot; context, and all skin &quot;must be covered.&quot; At his days in Penrallt, he had &quot;innocent crushes&quot; on boys; one in particular was a boy named Ronny, who &quot;climbed trees, killed pigeons with a catapult and broke all the school rules while never seeming to get caught.&quot; At Charterhouse, an all-boys school, it was common for boys to develop &quot;amorous but seldom erotic&quot; relationships, which the headmaster mostly ignored. Graves described boxing with a friend, Raymond Rodakowski, as having a &quot;a lot of sex feeling&quot;. And although Graves admitted to loving Raymond, he dismissed it as &quot;more comradely than amorous.&quot;

In his fourth year at Charterhouse, Graves met &quot;Dick&quot; (George &quot;Peter&quot; Harcourt Johnstone) with whom he developed &quot;an even stronger relationship&quot;. Johnstone was an object of adoration in Graves&#x27;s early poems. Graves&#x27;s feelings for Johnstone were exploited by bullies, who led Graves to believe that Johnstone was seen kissing the choir-master. Graves, jealous, demanded the choir-master&#x27;s resignation. During the First World War, Johnstone remained a &quot;solace&quot; to Graves. Despite Graves&#x27;s own &quot;pure and innocent&quot; view of Johnstone, Graves&#x27;s cousin Gerald wrote in a letter that Johnstone was: &quot;not at all the innocent fellow I took him for, but as bad as anyone could be&quot;. Johnstone remained a subject for Graves&#x27;s poems despite this. Communication between them ended when Johnstone&#x27;s mother found their letters and forbade further contact with Graves. Johnstone was later arrested for attempting to seduce a Canadian soldier, which removed Graves&#x27;s denial about Johnstone&#x27;s infidelity, causing Graves to collapse.

In 1917, Graves met Marjorie Machin, an auxiliary nurse from Kent. He admired her &quot;direct manner and practical approach to life&quot;. Graves did not pursue the relationship when he realised Machin had a fiancé on the Front. This began a period where Graves began to be interested in women with more masculine traits. Nancy Nicholson, his future wife, was an ardent feminist: she kept her hair short, wore trousers, and had &quot;boyish directness and youth.&quot; Her feminism never conflicted with Graves&#x27;s own ideas of female superiority. Siegfried Sassoon, who felt as if Graves and he had a relationship of a sort, felt betrayed by Graves&#x27;s new relationship and declined to go to the wedding. Graves apparently never loved Sassoon in the same way that Sassoon loved Graves.

Graves&#x27;s and Nicholson&#x27;s marriage was strained, Graves living with &quot;shell shock&quot;, and having an insatiable need for sex, which Nicholson did not reciprocate. Nancy forbade any mention of the war, which added to the conflict. In 1926, he met Laura Riding, with whom he ran away in 1929 while still married to Nicholson. Prior to this, Graves, Riding and Nicholson adopted a triadic relationship they called &quot;The Trinity.&quot; Despite the implications, Riding and Nicholson were most likely heterosexual. This triangle became the &quot;Holy Circle&quot; with the addition of Irish poet Geoffrey Phibbs, who himself was still married to Irish artist Norah McGuinness. This relationship revolved around the worship and reverence of Riding. Graves and Phibbs were both to sleep with Riding. When Phibbs attempted to leave the relationship, Graves was sent to track him down, even threatening to kill Phibbs if he did not return to the circle. When Phibbs resisted, Riding threw herself out of a window, Graves following suit to reach her. Graves&#x27;s commitment to Riding was so strong that he entered, on her word, a period of enforced celibacy, &quot;which he had not enjoyed&quot;.

By 1938, no longer entranced by Riding, Graves fell in love with the then-married Beryl Hodge. In 1950, after much dispute with Nicholson (whom he had not divorced yet), he married Beryl. Despite having a loving marriage with Beryl, Graves would take on a 17-year-old muse, Judith Bledsoe, in 1950. Although the relationship was described as &quot;not overtly sexual&quot;, in 1952 Graves attacked Judith&#x27;s new fiancé, getting the police called on him in the process. He later had three successive female muses, who came to dominate his poetry.

==Death and legacy==

=== Death ===

During the early 1970s, Graves began to experience increasingly severe memory loss. By his 80th birthday in 1975, he had come to the end of his working life. He lived for another decade, in an increasingly dependent condition, and had taken a vow of silence before dying of heart failure on 7 December 1985 at the age of 90 years. His body was buried the next morning in the small churchyard on a hill at Deià, at the site of a shrine that had once been sacred to the White Goddess of Pelion. His second wife, Beryl Graves, died on 27 October 2003 and her body was interred in the same grave.

===Memorials===
Three of his former houses have a blue plaque on them: in Wimbledon, Brixham, and Islip.

On 11 November 1985, Graves was among sixteen Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in Westminster Abbey&#x27;s Poets&#x27; Corner. The inscription on the stone was taken from Wilfred Owen&#x27;s &quot;Preface&quot; to his poems and reads: &quot;My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.&quot; Of the 16 poets, Graves was the only one still living at the time of the commemoration ceremony, though he would die less than a month later.

===Children===
Graves had eight children. With his first wife, Nancy Nicholson (1899–1977), he had Jennie (who married journalist Alexander Clifford), David (who was killed in the Second World War), Catherine (who married nuclear scientist Clifford Dalton at Aldershot), and Sam. With his second wife, Beryl Pritchard Hodge (1915–2003), he had William (author of the well-received memoir &quot;Wild Olives: Life on Majorca with Robert Graves&quot;), Lucia (a translator and author whose versions of novels by Carlos Ruiz Zafón have been quite successful commercially), Juan (addressed in one of Robert Graves&#x27; most famous and critically praised poems, &quot;To Juan at the Winter Solstice&quot;), and Tomás (a writer and musician).

=== Awards ===
UK government documents released in 2012 indicate that Graves turned down a CBE in 1957. In 2012, the Nobel Records were opened after 50 years, and it was revealed that Graves was among a shortlist of authors considered for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature, along with John Steinbeck (who was that year&#x27;s recipient of the prize), Lawrence Durrell, Jean Anouilh and Karen Blixen. Graves was rejected because, even though he had written several historical novels, he was still primarily seen as a poet, and committee member Henry Olsson was reluctant to award any Anglo-Saxon poet the prize before the death of Ezra Pound, believing that other writers did not match his talent. UK government documents released in 2023 reveal that in 1967 Graves was considered for, but then passed over for, the post of Poet Laureate.

<text>In computational complexity theory, PSPACE is the set of all decision problems that can be solved by a Turing machine using a polynomial amount of space.

== Formal definition ==
If we denote by SPACE(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)), the set of all problems that can be solved by Turing machines using &quot;O&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) space for some function &quot;f&quot; of the input size &quot;n&quot;, then we can define PSPACE formally as

:formula_1

It turns out that allowing the Turing machine to be nondeterministic does not add any extra power. Because of Savitch&#x27;s theorem, NPSPACE is equivalent to PSPACE, essentially because a deterministic Turing machine can simulate a nondeterministic Turing machine without needing much more space (even though it may use much more time). Also, the complements of all problems in PSPACE are also in PSPACE, meaning that co-PSPACE PSPACE.

== Relation among other classes ==

The following relations are known between PSPACE and the complexity classes NL, P, NP, PH, EXPTIME and EXPSPACE (note that ⊊ denotes strict containment, not to be confused with ⊈):

:formula_2

From the third line, it follows that both in the first and in the second line, at least one of the set containments must be strict, but it is not known which. It is widely suspected that all are strict.

The containments in the third line are both known to be strict. The first follows from direct diagonalization (the space hierarchy theorem, NL ⊊ NPSPACE) and the fact that PSPACE NPSPACE via Savitch&#x27;s theorem. The second follows simply from the space hierarchy theorem.

The hardest problems in PSPACE are the PSPACE-complete problems. See PSPACE-complete for examples of problems that are suspected to be in PSPACE but not in NP.

== Closure properties ==
The class PSPACE is closed under operations union, complementation, and Kleene star.

== Other characterizations ==
An alternative characterization of PSPACE is the set of problems decidable by an alternating Turing machine in polynomial time, sometimes called APTIME or just AP.

A logical characterization of PSPACE from descriptive complexity theory is that it is the set of problems expressible in second-order logic with the addition of a transitive closure operator. A full transitive closure is not needed; a commutative transitive closure and even weaker forms suffice. It is the addition of this operator that (possibly) distinguishes PSPACE from PH.

A major result of complexity theory is that PSPACE can be characterized as all the languages recognizable by a particular interactive proof system, the one defining the class IP. In this system, there is an all-powerful prover trying to convince a randomized polynomial-time verifier that a string is in the language. It should be able to convince the verifier with high probability if the string is in the language, but should not be able to convince it except with low probability if the string is not in the language.

PSPACE can be characterized as the quantum complexity class QIP.

PSPACE is also equal to PCTC, problems solvable by classical computers using closed timelike curves, as well as to BQPCTC, problems solvable by quantum computers using closed timelike curves.

== PSPACE-completeness ==

A language &quot;B&quot; is &quot;PSPACE-complete&quot; if it is in PSPACE and it is PSPACE-hard, which means for all &quot;A&quot; ∈ PSPACE, formula_3, where formula_3 means that there is a polynomial-time many-one reduction from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;. PSPACE-complete problems are of great importance to studying PSPACE problems because they represent the most difficult problems in PSPACE. Finding a simple solution to a PSPACE-complete problem would mean we have a simple solution to all other problems in PSPACE because all PSPACE problems could be reduced to a PSPACE-complete problem.

An example of a PSPACE-complete problem is the quantified Boolean formula problem (usually abbreviated to QBF or TQBF; the T stands for &quot;true&quot;).

<doc id="39353" wikidata="Q170384" url="?curid=39353" title="Operetta">
<text>Operetta is a form of theatre and a genre of light opera. It includes spoken dialogue, songs and including dances. It is lighter than opera in terms of its music, orchestral size, and length of the work. Apart from its shorter length, the operetta is usually of a light and amusing character. The subject matter may portray &quot;lovers&#x27; spats, mistaken identities, sudden reversals of fortune, and glittering parties&quot;. It sometimes also includes satirical commentaries.

&quot;Operetta&quot; is the Italian diminutive of &quot;opera&quot; and was used originally to describe a shorter, perhaps less ambitious work than an opera. Operetta provides an alternative to operatic performances in an accessible form targeting a different audience. Operetta became a recognizable form in the mid-19th century in France, and its popularity led to the development of many national styles of operetta. Distinctive styles emerged across countries including Austria-Hungary, Germany, England, Spain, the Philippines, Mexico, Cuba, and the United States. Through the transfer of operetta among different countries, cultural cosmopolitanism emerged in the previous century. Operetta as a genre lost favor in the 1930s and gave way to modern musical theatre. Important operetta composers include Johann Strauss, Jacques Offenbach, Franz Lehár, and Francisco Alonso.

== Definitions ==
The term operetta arises in the mid-eighteenth-century Italy and it is first acknowledged as an independent genre in Paris around 1850. Castil-Blaze&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire de la musique moderne&quot; claims that this term has a long history and that Mozart was one of the first people to use the word operetta, disparagingly, describing operettas as &quot;certain dramatic abortions, those miniature compositions in which one finds only cold songs and couplets from vaudeville&quot;. The definition of operetta has changed over the centuries and ranges depending on each country&#x27;s history with the genre. It is often used to refer to pieces that resemble the one-act compositions by Offenbach in contrast with his full length compositions, ‘opéra-bouffe’. Offenbach invented this art form in response to the French government&#x27;s oppressive laws surrounding the stagings of works that were larger than one act or contained more than four characters. 
== History ==
Operetta became recognized as a musical genre around 1850 in Paris. In 1870, the centre for operetta shifted to Vienna when Paris fell to the Prussians. The form of operetta continued to evolve through the First World War.

There are some common characteristics among operettas that flourished from the mid-1850s through the early 1900s, beginning with the French opéra-bouffe. They contain spoken dialogue interspersed between musical numbers, and often the principal characters, as well as the chorus, are called upon to dance, although the music is largely derived from 19th-century operatic styles, with an emphasis on singable melodies. Operetta in the twentieth century is more complex and reached its pinnacle in Austria and Germany.

Operetta is a precursor of the modern musical theatre or the &quot;musical&quot;. In the early decades of the 20th century, operetta continued to exist alongside the newer musicals, with each influencing the other. The distinctive traits of operetta are found in the musical theatre works of Jerome Kern, Richard Rodgers and Stephen Sondheim.

==Operetta in French==

=== Origins ===
Operetta was first created in Paris, France in the middle of the 19th century in order to satisfy a need for short, light works in contrast to the full-length entertainment of the increasingly serious &quot;opéra comique&quot;. By this time, the &quot;comique&quot; part of the genre name had become misleading: Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; (1875) is an example of an &quot;opéra comique&quot; with a tragic plot. The definition of &quot;comique&quot; meant something closer to &quot;humanistic&quot;, meant to portray &quot;real life&quot; in a more realistic way, representing tragedy and comedy next to each other, as Shakespeare had done centuries earlier. With this new connotation, &quot;opéra comique&quot; had dominated the French operatic stage since the decline of &quot;tragédie lyrique&quot;. The origins of French operetta began when comic actors would perform dances and songs to crowds of people at fairs on open-air stages. In the beginning of the 18th century these actors began to perform comic parodies of known operas. These performances formed operetta as a casual genre derived from &quot;opéra comique&quot;, while returning to a simpler form of music. Many scholars have debated as to which composer should be credited as the inventor of operetta; Jaques Offenbach or Hervé. It is concluded that Hervé completed the groundwork, and Offenbach refined and developed the art form into the concept of operetta as we know it today. Therefore, &quot;Offenbach is considered the father of French operetta – but so is Hervé.&quot;

=== Notable composers ===
Hervé was a singer, composer, librettist, conductor, and scene painter. In 1842, he wrote the one act &quot;opérette&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Ours et le pacha&quot;, based on the popular vaudeville by Eugène Scribe and X. B. Saintine. In 1848, Hervé made his first notable appearance on the Parisian stage, with &quot;Don Quichotte et Sancho Pança&quot; (after Cervantes), which can be considered the starting point for the new French musical theatre tradition. Hervé&#x27;s most famous works are the Gounod parody &quot;Le petit Faust&quot; (1869) and &quot;Mam&#x27;zelle Nitouche&quot; (1883).

Jacques Offenbach is most responsible for the development and popularization of operetta—also called or —giving it its enormous vogue during the Second Empire and afterwards. In 1849, Offenbach obtained permission to open the Théâtre des Bouffes Parisiens, a theatre company that offered programs of two or three satirical one-act sketches. The company was so successful that it led to the elongation of these sketches into an evening&#x27;s duration. However, Offenbach&#x27;s productions were bound by the police prefecture in Paris, which specified the type of performance that would be allowed: &quot;pantomimes with at most five performers, one-act comic musical dialogues for two to three actors, and dance routines with no more than five dancers; choruses were strictly forbidden.&quot; These rules defined what came to be defined as operetta: &quot;a small unpretentious operatic work that had no tragic implications and was designed to entertain the public&quot;. Two other French composers, Robert Planquette and Charles Lecocq, followed Offenbach&#x27;s model and wrote the operettas &quot;Les Cloches de Corneville&quot; (&quot;The Bells of Normandy&quot;) and &quot;La Fille de Madame Angot&quot; (&quot;The Daughter of Madame Angot&quot;). The two operettas were considered a major hit.

The political limitations placed on Offenbach and Parisian theatre were gradually lifted, and operetta gained wide popularity. While Offenbach&#x27;s earliest one-act pieces included &quot;Les deux aveugles&quot;, &quot;Le violoneux&quot; and &quot;Ba-ta-clan&quot; (all 1855) did well, his first full-length operetta, &quot;Orphée aux enfers&quot; (1858), was by far the most successful. It became the first repertory operetta and was staged hundreds of times across Europe and beyond. Offenbach&#x27;s legacy is seen in operettas throughout the late 19th century and beyond by encouraging Strauss the Younger to bring the genre to Austria-Hungary. Offenbach also traveled to the US and England educating musicians on the more than 100 operettas he wrote during his lifetime. This international travel resulted in the appearance of strong national schools in both nations. By the 1870s, however, Offenbach&#x27;s popularity declined. The public showed more interest in romantic operettas that showed the &quot;grace and refinement&quot; of the late Romantic period. This included Messager&#x27;s operetta &quot;Véronique&quot; and Louis Ganne&#x27;s &quot;Les saltimbanques&quot;. The 20th century found French operetta even more out of favor as the international public turned to Anglo-American and Viennese operettas, which continued to develop the art form into the late Romantic era.

== Operetta in German ==
Offenbach was unabashed about spreading operetta around the continent. In 1861, he staged some of his recent works at the Carltheater in Vienna, which paved the way for Austrian and German composers. Soon, Vienna became the epicenter of operetta productions. It is because of the Viennese operetta, not the French, that the term is used to describe a full-length work. Additionally, after the Prussian defeat in 1866, operetta became the sign of a new age in Austria, marked by modernity and industrialization.

===Austria–Hungary===

The most significant composer of operetta in the German language was the Austrian Johann Strauss II (1825–1899). Strauss was recruited from the dance hall and introduced a distinct Viennese style to the genre. Strauss was highly influenced by the work of Offenbach, so much so that he collaborated with many of Offenbach’s librettists for his most popular works. His operetta, &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; (1874), became the most performed operetta in the world, and remains his most popular stage work. In all, Strauss wrote 16 operettas and one opera, most with great success when first premiered.

Strauss&#x27;s satire was often generic, unlike Offenbach who commented on real-life matters.

Strauss&#x27;s operettas, waltzes, polkas, and marches often have a strongly Viennese style, and his popularity causes many to think of him as the national composer of Austria. The Theater an der Wien never failed to draw huge crowds when his stage works were first performed. After many of the numbers the audience would call noisily for encores.

Franz von Suppé, also known as Francesco Ezechiele Ermenegildo, Cavaliere Suppé-Demelli, was born in 1819 and his fame rivals that of Offenbach. Suppé was a leading composer and conductor in Vienna and most known for his operetta &quot;Leichte Kavallerie&quot; (1866), &quot;Fatinitza&quot; (1876), and &quot;Boccaccio&quot; (1879). Suppé was a contemporary to Strauss and composed over 30 operettas 180 farces, ballets and other stage works. Recently, though most of his works have been fallen into obscurity, many of them have been reprised within films, cartoons, advertisements and so on. Both Strauss and Suppé are considered to be the most notable composers of the Golden Age of Viennese operetta.

Following the death of Johann Strauss and his contemporary, Franz von Suppé, Franz Lehár was the heir apparent. Lehar is widely considered the leading operetta composer of the 20th century and his most successful operetta, &quot;Die lustige Witwe&quot; (&quot;The Merry Widow&quot;), is one of the classic operettas still in repertory.

Lehár assisted in leading operetta into the Silver Age of Viennese Operetta. During this time, Viennese Censorship laws were changed in 1919. Lehár is most responsible for giving the genre renewed vitality. Studying at the Prague Conservatory Lehár began as a theatre violinist and then took off as a composer in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During this 1905, Lehár&#x27;s &quot;Die lustige Witwe&quot; (&quot;The Merry Widow&quot;) paved a pathway for composers such as Fall, Oscar Straus, and Kálmán to continue the tradition of Operetta. Lehár was also one of the first composers who began to incorporate into film. [2]

The Viennese tradition was carried on by Oscar Straus, Carl Zeller, Karl Millöcker, Leo Fall, Richard Heuberger, Edmund Eysler, Ralph Benatzky, Robert Stolz, Leo Ascher, Emmerich Kálmán, Nico Dostal, Fred Raymond, Igo Hofstetter, Paul Abraham and Ivo Tijardović in the 20th century.

===Germany===

In the same way that Vienna was the center of Austrian operetta, Berlin was the center of German operetta. Berlin operetta often had its own style, including, especially after World War I, elements of jazz and other syncopated dance rhythms, a transatlantic style, and the presence of ragged marching tunes. Berlin operettas also sometimes included aspects of burlesque, revue, farce, or cabaret.

Paul Lincke pioneered the Berlin operetta in 1899 with &quot;Frau Luna&quot;, which includes &quot;Berliner Luft&quot; (&quot;Berlin Air&quot;), which became the unofficial anthem of Berlin. His &quot;Lysistrata&quot; (1902) includes the song and tune &quot;The Glow-Worm&quot;, which remains quite popular internationally. Much later, in the 1920s and 1930s, Kurt Weill took a more extreme form of the Berlin operetta style and used it in his operas, operettas, and musicals. It is arguable that some of Kurt Weill&#x27;s compositions could be considered modernist operetta.

The Berlin-style operetta coexisted with more bourgeois, charming, home-loving, and nationalistic German operettas – some of which were called &quot;Volksoperetten&quot; (folk operettas). A prime example is Leon Jessel&#x27;s extremely popular 1917 &quot;Schwarzwaldmädel&quot; (&quot;Black Forest Girl&quot;). These bucolic, nostalgic, home-loving operettas were officially preferred over Berlin-style operettas after 1933, when the Nazis came to power and instituted the &quot;Reichsmusikkammer&quot; (State Music Institute), which deprecated and banned &quot;decadent&quot; music like jazz and similar &quot;foreign&quot; musical forms. In the beginning of twenty-first century, German revival of operetta was an unforeseen theatrical development.

Notable German operetta composers include Paul Lincke, Eduard Künneke, Walter Kollo, Jean Gilbert, Leon Jessel, Rudolf Dellinger, Walter Goetze and Ludwig Schmidseder.

== Operetta in English ==

Offenbach&#x27;s influence reached England by the 1860s. Arthur Sullivan, of the Gilbert and Sullivan duo, composed &quot;Cox and Box&quot; (1866) as a direct reaction to Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Les deux aveugles&quot; (1855). Gilbert and Sullivan solidified the format in England with their long-running collaboration during the Victorian era. With W. S. Gilbert writing the libretti and Sullivan composing the music, the pair produced 14 comic operas, which were later called Savoy Operas. Most were enormously popular in Britain, the U.S., and elsewhere. Gilbert, Sullivan, and their producer Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte themselves call their joint works comic operas to distinguish this family-friendly fare from the risqué French operettas of the 1850s and 1860s. Their works, such as &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; and &quot;The Mikado&quot;, continue to enjoy regular performances throughout the English-speaking world. While many of these operas seem to be very light-hearted, works such as the Mikado were making political commentaries on the British government and military with one of the main topics being capital punishment which was still widely used at the time.

English operetta continued into the 1890s, with works by composers such as Edward German, Ivan Caryll and Sidney Jones. These quickly evolved into the lighter song-and-dance pieces known as Edwardian musical comedy. Beginning in 1907, with &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, many of the Viennese operettas were adapted very successfully for the English stage. To explain this phenomenon, Derek Scott writes,In January 1908, London’s &quot;Daily Mail&quot; claimed that &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; had been performed 450 times in Vienna, 400 times in Berlin, 350 times in St Petersburg, 300 times in Copenhagen, and was currently playing every evening in Europe in nine languages. In the USA, five companies were presenting it, and &quot;the rush for tickets at the New Amsterdam Theatre&quot; was likened to &quot;the feverish crowding round the doors of a threatened bank&quot;. Stan Czech, in his Lehár biography, claims that by 1910 it had been performed &quot;around 18,000 times in ten languages on 154 American, 142 German, and 135 British stages&quot;.The international embrace of operetta directly correlated with the development of both the West End in London and Broadway in New York. American audiences were first introduced to operetta through Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; in 1878&quot;.&quot; American operetta composers included Victor Herbert, whose works at the beginning of the 20th century were influenced by both Viennese operetta and Gilbert and Sullivan. He was followed by Sigmund Romberg and Rudolph Friml. Nevertheless, American operetta largely gave way, by the end of World War I, to musicals, such as the Princess Theatre musicals, and revues, followed by the musicals of Rodgers and Hart, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and others. Another notable operetta in English is Candide by Leonard Bernstein. It was advertised as a “comic operetta.” Candide’s score in some ways was typical for its announced genre with some waltzes, but Bernstein added the schottische, gavotte, and other dances, and also entered the opera house with the aria “Glitter and Be Gay”

== Operetta in Italian ==
Operetta was the first imported vocal genre in Italy. Since the 1860s, French and Viennese composers such as Offenbach, Hervé, Suppé, Strauss Jr and Lehár have significantly influenced the operatic tradition of Italy. The widespread popularity of foreign operetta in Italy reached its climax at the turn of the century, in particular with the success of La vedova allegra, which premiered in Milan in 1907. Italian operetta composers tended to stretch the definition of an &quot;operetta&quot; more than other nations in order to fit the beauty of Italian Romantic opera style. An example would be Giacomo Puccini, who developed his work in the realistic &quot;verisimo&quot; style, and would compose &quot;operettas in three acts&quot;. Other notable composers of Italian operetta include Vincenzo Valente, Ruggero Leoncavallo, Pasquale Mario Costa, Pietro Mascagni, Carlo Lombardo, Enrico Toselli, Virgilio Ranzato and Giuseppe Pietri.

=== Reception and controversy ===
The audiences of operetta during the 1860s and 1870s are described as rowdy and loud. Operetta was considered one of the major controversies about Italian music and culture between the 1860s and the 1920s. During that period, strong nationalistic undertones in Italy strived to unify its national identity. Recognizing operetta as a foreign genre, operetta was perceived as an art form that would contaminate Italian opera or illegitimately undermine its primacy on the stage. It was not until the early twentieth century that Italian composers systematically engaged in writing operetta.

<doc id="39354" wikidata="Q182990" url="?curid=39354" title="Uracil">
<text>Uracil () (symbol U or Ura) is one of the four nucleotide bases in the nucleic acid RNA. The others are adenine (A), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). In RNA, uracil binds to adenine via two hydrogen bonds. In DNA, the uracil nucleobase is replaced by thymine (T). Uracil is a demethylated form of thymine.

Uracil is a common and naturally occurring pyrimidine derivative. The name &quot;uracil&quot; was coined in 1885 by the German chemist Robert Behrend, who was attempting to synthesize derivatives of uric acid. Originally discovered in 1900 by Alberto Ascoli, it was isolated by hydrolysis of yeast nuclein; it was also found in bovine thymus and spleen, herring sperm, and wheat germ. It is a planar, unsaturated compound that has the ability to absorb light.

Uracil that was formed extraterrestrially has been detected in the Murchison meteorite, in near-Earth asteroid Ryugu, and possibly on the surface of the moon Titan. It has been synthesized under cold laboratory conditions similar to outer space, from pyrimidine embedded in water ice and exposed to ultraviolet light.

==Properties==
In RNA, uracil base-pairs with adenine and replaces thymine during DNA transcription. Methylation of uracil produces thymine. In DNA, the evolutionary substitution of thymine for uracil may have increased DNA stability and improved the efficiency of DNA replication (discussed below). Uracil pairs with adenine through hydrogen bonding. When base pairing with adenine, uracil acts as both a hydrogen bond acceptor and a hydrogen bond donor. In RNA, uracil binds with a ribose sugar to form the ribonucleoside uridine. When a phosphate attaches to uridine, uridine 5′-monophosphate is produced.

Uracil undergoes amide-imidic acid tautomeric shifts because any nuclear instability the molecule may have from the lack of formal aromaticity is compensated by the cyclic-amidic stability. The amide tautomer is referred to as the lactam structure, while the imidic acid tautomer is referred to as the lactim structure. These tautomeric forms are predominant at pH 7. The lactam structure is the most common form of uracil.

Uracil also recycles itself to form nucleotides by undergoing a series of phosphoribosyltransferase reactions. Degradation of uracil produces the substrates β-alanine, carbon dioxide, and ammonia.

Oxidative degradation of uracil produces urea and maleic acid in the presence of H2O2 and Fe2+ or in the presence of diatomic oxygen and Fe2+.

Uracil is a weak acid. The first site of ionization of uracil is not known. The negative charge is placed on the oxygen anion and produces a p&quot;K&quot;a of less than or equal to 12. The basic p&quot;K&quot;a = −3.4, while the acidic p&quot;K&quot;a = 9.389. In the gas phase, uracil has four sites that are more acidic than water.

===In DNA===
Uracil is rarely found in DNA, and this may have been an evolutionary change to increase genetic stability. This is because cytosine can deaminate spontaneously to produce uracil through hydrolytic deamination. Therefore, if there were an organism that used uracil in its DNA, the deamination of cytosine (which undergoes base pairing with guanine) would lead to formation of uracil (which would base pair with adenine) during DNA synthesis.
Uracil-DNA glycosylase excises uracil bases from double-stranded DNA. This enzyme would therefore recognize and cut out both types of uracil – the one incorporated naturally, and the one formed due to cytosine deamination, which would trigger unnecessary and inappropriate repair processes.

This problem is believed to have been solved in terms of evolution, that is by &quot;tagging&quot; (methylating) uracil. Methylated uracil is identical to thymine. Hence the hypothesis that, over time, thymine became standard in DNA instead of uracil. So cells continue to use uracil in RNA, and not in DNA, because RNA is shorter-lived than DNA, and any potential uracil-related errors do not lead to lasting damage. Apparently, either there was no evolutionary pressure to replace uracil in RNA with the more complex thymine, or uracil has some chemical property that is useful in RNA, which thymine lacks. Uracil-containing DNA still exists, for example in: 
* DNA of several phages
* Endopterygote development
* Hypermutations during the synthesis of vertebrate antibodies.

==Synthesis==

===Biological===

Organisms synthesize uracil, in the form of uridine monophosphate (UMP), by decarboxylating orotidine 5&#x27;-monophosphate (orotidylic acid). In humans this decarboxylation is achieved by the enzyme UMP synthase. In contrast to the purine nucleotides, the pyrimidine ring (orotidylic acid) that leads uracil is synthesized first and then linked to ribose phosphate, forming UMP.

===Laboratory===
There are many laboratory synthesis of uracil available. The first reaction is the simplest of the syntheses, by adding water to cytosine to produce uracil and ammonia:

The most common way to synthesize uracil is by the condensation of malic acid with urea in fuming sulfuric acid:

: + → + 2 + 

Uracil can also be synthesized by a double decomposition of thiouracil in aqueous chloroacetic acid.

Photodehydrogenation of 5,6-diuracil, which is synthesized by beta-alanine reacting with urea, produces uracil.

===Prebiotic===
In 2009, NASA scientists reported having produced uracil from pyrimidine and water ice by exposing it to ultraviolet light under space-like conditions. This suggests a possible natural original source for uracil. In 2014, NASA scientists reported that additional complex DNA and RNA organic compounds of life, including uracil, cytosine and thymine, have been formed in the laboratory under outer space conditions, starting with ice, pyrimidine, ammonia, and methanol, which are compounds found in astrophysical environments. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a carbon-rich chemical found in the Universe, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar dust and gas clouds.

Based on 12C/13C isotopic ratios of organic compounds found in the Murchison meteorite, it is believed that uracil, xanthine, and related molecules can also be formed extraterrestrially. Data from the Cassini mission, orbiting in the Saturn system, suggests that uracil is present in the surface of the moon Titan. In 2023, uracil was observed in a sample from 162173 Ryugu, a near-Earth asteroid, with no exposure to Earth&#x27;s biosphere, giving further evidence for synthesis in space.

==Reactions==

Uracil readily undergoes regular reactions including oxidation, nitration, and alkylation. While in the presence of phenol (PhOH) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), uracil can be visualized in ultraviolet light. Uracil also has the capability to react with elemental halogens because of the presence of more than one strongly electron donating group.

Uracil readily undergoes addition to ribose sugars and phosphates to partake in synthesis and further reactions in the body. Uracil becomes uridine, uridine monophosphate (UMP), uridine diphosphate (UDP), uridine triphosphate (UTP), and uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose). Each one of these molecules is synthesized in the body and has specific functions.

When uracil reacts with anhydrous hydrazine, a first-order kinetic reaction occurs and the uracil ring opens up. If the pH of the reaction increases to &gt; 10.5, the uracil anion forms, making the reaction go much more slowly. The same slowing of the reaction occurs if the pH decreases, because of the protonation of the hydrazine. The reactivity of uracil remains unchanged, even if the temperature changes.

==Uses==
Uracil&#x27;s use in the body is to help carry out the synthesis of many enzymes necessary for cell function through bonding with riboses and phosphates. Uracil serves as allosteric regulator and coenzyme for reactions in animals and in plants. UMP controls the activity of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and aspartate transcarbamoylase in plants, while UDP and UTP regulate CPSase II activity in animals. UDP-glucose regulates the conversion of glucose to galactose in the liver and other tissues in the process of carbohydrate metabolism. Uracil is also involved in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides and the transportation of sugars containing aldehydes. Uracil is important for the detoxification of many carcinogens, for instance those found in tobacco smoke. Uracil is also required to detoxify many drugs such as cannabinoids (THC) and morphine (opioids). It can also slightly increase the risk for cancer in unusual cases in which the body is extremely deficient in folate. The deficiency in folate leads to increased ratio of deoxyuridine monophosphates (dUMP)/deoxythymidine monophosphates (dTMP) and uracil misincorporation into DNA and eventually low production of DNA.

Uracil can be used for drug delivery and as a pharmaceutical. When elemental fluorine reacts with uracil, they produce 5-fluorouracil. 5-Fluorouracil is an anticancer drug (antimetabolite) used to masquerade as uracil during the nucleic acid replication process. Because 5-fluorouracil is similar in shape to, but does not undergo the same chemistry as, uracil, the drug inhibits RNA transcription enzymes, thereby blocking RNA synthesis and stopping the growth of cancerous cells. Uracil can also be used in the synthesis of caffeine. Uracil has also shown potential as a HIV viral capsid inhibitor. Uracil derivatives have antiviral, anti-tubercular and anti-leishmanial activity.

Uracil can be used to determine microbial contamination of tomatoes. The presence of uracil indicates lactic acid bacteria contamination of the fruit. Uracil derivatives containing a diazine ring are used in pesticides. Uracil derivatives are more often used as antiphotosynthetic herbicides, destroying weeds in cotton, sugar beet, turnips, soya, peas, sunflower crops, vineyards, berry plantations, and orchards. Uracil derivatives can enhance the activity of antimicrobial polysaccharides such as chitosan.

In yeast, uracil concentrations are inversely proportional to uracil permease.

Mixtures containing uracil are also commonly used to test reversed-phase HPLC columns. As uracil is essentially unretained by the non-polar stationary phase, this can be used to determine the dwell time (and subsequently dwell volume, given a known flow rate) of the system.

<text>Anne Boleyn (; 1501 or 1507 – 19 May 1536) was Queen of England from 1533 to 1536, as the second wife of King Henry VIII. The circumstances of her marriage and execution, by beheading for treason, made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval that marked the start of the English Reformation.

Anne was the daughter of Thomas Boleyn (later Earl of Wiltshire), and his wife, Elizabeth Howard, and was educated in the Netherlands and France. Anne returned to England in early 1522, to marry her cousin James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormond; the marriage plans were broken off, and instead, she secured a post at court as maid of honour to Henry VIII&#x27;s wife, Catherine of Aragon. Early in 1523, Anne was secretly betrothed to Henry Percy, son of Henry Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland, but the betrothal was broken off when the Earl refused to support it. Cardinal Thomas Wolsey refused the match in January 1524.

In February or March 1526, Henry VIII began his pursuit of Anne. She resisted his attempts to seduce her, refusing to become his mistress, as her sister Mary had previously been. Henry focused on annulling his marriage to Catherine, so he would be free to marry Anne. After Wolsey failed to obtain an annulment from Pope Clement VII, it became clear the marriage would not be annulled by the Catholic Church. As a result, Henry and his advisers, such as Thomas Cromwell, began breaking the Church&#x27;s power in England and closing the monasteries. Henry and Anne formally married on 25 January 1533, after a secret wedding on 14 November 1532. On 23 May 1533, the newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine&#x27;s marriage null and void. Five days later, he declared Henry and Anne&#x27;s marriage valid. Clement excommunicated Henry and Cranmer. As a result of the marriage and excommunications, the first break between the Church of England and the Catholic Church took place, and the King took control of the Church of England. Anne was crowned queen on 1June 1533. On 7September, she gave birth to the future Queen Elizabeth I. Henry was disappointed to have a daughter, but hoped a son would follow and professed to love Elizabeth. Anne subsequently had three miscarriages and by March 1536, Henry was courting Jane Seymour.

Henry had Anne investigated for high treason in April 1536. On 2May, she was arrested and sent to the Tower of London, where she was tried before a jury, including Henry Percy, her former betrothed, and her uncle Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk. She was convicted on 15 May and beheaded four days later. Historians view the charges, which included adultery, incest with her brother George, and plotting to kill the King, as unconvincing.

After her daughter, Elizabeth, became queen in 1558, Anne became venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of George Wyatt. She has inspired, or been mentioned in, many cultural works and retained her hold on the popular imagination. She has been called &quot;the most influential and important queen consort England has ever had&quot;, as she provided the occasion for Henry to declare the English Church&#x27;s independence from the Vatican.

== Early years ==

Anne was the daughter of Thomas Boleyn, later Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond, and his wife, Elizabeth Howard, who was the eldest daughter of Thomas Howard, then Earl of Surrey and future 2nd Duke of Norfolk, and his first wife Elizabeth Tilney. Anne&#x27;s date of birth is unknown.

The academic debate about Anne&#x27;s birth date focuses on two key dates: and . Eric Ives, a British historian and legal expert, advocates 1501, while Retha Warnicke, an American scholar who has also written a biography of Anne, prefers 1507. The key piece of surviving written evidence is a letter Anne wrote sometime in 1514. She wrote it in French to her father, who was still living in England while Anne was completing her education at Mechelen, in the Habsburg Netherlands, now Belgium. Ives argues that the style of the letter and its mature handwriting prove that Anne must have been about 13 at the time of its composition, while Warnicke argues that the numerous misspellings and grammar errors show that the letter was written by a child. In Ives&#x27;s view, this would also be around the minimum age that a girl could be a maid of honour, as Anne was to the regent, Margaret of Austria. This is supported by claims of a chronicler from the late 16th century, who wrote that Anne was 20 when she returned from France. These findings are contested by Warnicke in several books and articles, and the evidence does not conclusively support either date.

An independent contemporary source supports the 1507 date: William Camden wrote a history of the reign of Elizabeth I and was granted access to the private papers of Lord Burghley and to the state archives. In that history, in the chapter dealing with Elizabeth&#x27;s early life, he records that Anne was born in 1507.

As with Anne, it is uncertain when her two siblings were born, but the evidence indicates that her sister Mary was older than Anne. Mary&#x27;s children believed their mother was the elder sister, and her grandson claimed the Ormond title in 1596 on the basis that she was the elder daughter, which Elizabeth I accepted. Anne&#x27;s brother George was born around 1504, and Thomas Boleyn, writing in the 1530s, stated that his children were born before the death of his father, William Boleyn, in 1505.
Anne&#x27;s paternal ancestor, Geoffrey Boleyn, had been a mercer and wool merchant before becoming Lord Mayor. The Boleyn family originally came from Blickling in Norfolk, north of Norwich. Anne&#x27;s relatives included the Howards, one of the preeminent families in England; and Anne&#x27;s ancestors included King Edward I of England. According to Eric Ives, she was certainly of more noble birth than Jane Seymour and Catherine Parr, Henry VIII&#x27;s other English wives. The spelling of the Boleyn name was variable, as common at the time. Sometimes it was written as &quot;Bullen&quot;, hence the bull&#x27;s heads which formed part of her family arms.

At the court of Margaret of Austria in the Netherlands, Anne is listed as &quot;Boullan&quot;. From there she signed the letter to her father as &quot;Anna de Boullan&quot;. She was also called &quot;Anna Bolina&quot;; this Latinised form is used in most portraits of her.

Anne&#x27;s early education was typical for women of her class. In 1513, she was invited to join the schoolroom of Margaret of Austria and her four wards. Her academic education was limited to arithmetic, her family genealogy, grammar, history, reading, spelling and writing. She also developed domestic skills such as dancing, embroidery, good manners, household management, music, needlework and singing. Anne learned to play games, such as cards, chess and dice. She was also taught archery, falconry, horseback riding and hunting.

=== The Netherlands and France ===
Anne&#x27;s father, Thomas, continued his diplomatic career under Henry VIII. In Europe, his charm won many admirers, including Margaret of Austria, daughter of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. During this period, Margaret ruled the Netherlands on her nephew Charles&#x27;s behalf and was so impressed with Thomas Boleyn that she offered his daughter Anne a place in her household. Ordinarily, a girl had to be 12 years old to have such an honour, but Anne may have been younger, as Margaret affectionately called her . Anne made a good impression in the Netherlands with her manners and studiousness; Margaret reported that she was well spoken and pleasant for her young age, and told Thomas that his daughter was &quot;so presentable and so pleasant, considering her youthful age, that I am more beholden to you for sending her to me, than you to me&quot;. Anne stayed at the Court of Savoy in Mechelen from spring 1513 until her father arranged for her to attend Henry VIII&#x27;s sister Mary, who was about to marry Louis XII of France in October 1514.

In France, Anne was a maid of honour to Queen Mary, and then to Mary&#x27;s 15-year-old stepdaughter Queen Claude, with whom she stayed for nearly seven years. In the Queen&#x27;s household, she completed her study of French and developed interests in art, fashion, illuminated manuscripts, literature, music, poetry and religious philosophy. Ives asserts that she &quot;owed her evangelicalism to France&quot;, studying &quot;reformist books&quot;, and Jacques Lefevre&#x27;s translations into French of the bible and the Pauline epistles. She also acquired knowledge of French culture, dance, etiquette, literature, music and poetry; and gained experience in flirtation and courtly love. Though all knowledge of Anne&#x27;s experiences in the French court is conjecture, even Ives suggests that she was likely to have made the acquaintance of King Francis I&#x27;s sister, Marguerite de Navarre, a patron of humanists and reformers. Marguerite de Navarre was also an author in her own right, and her works include elements of Christian mysticism and reform that verged on heresy, though she was protected by her status as the French king&#x27;s beloved sister. She or her circle may have encouraged Anne&#x27;s interest in religious reform, as well as in poetry and literature. Anne&#x27;s education in France proved itself in later years, inspiring many new trends among the ladies and courtiers of England. It may have been instrumental in pressing their King toward England&#x27;s break with the Papacy. William Forrest, author of a contemporary poem about Catherine of Aragon, complimented Anne&#x27;s &quot;passing excellent&quot; skill as a dancer. &quot;Here&quot;, he wrote, &quot;was [a] fresh young damsel, that could trip and go.&quot;

== At the court of Henry VIII: 1522–1533 ==
Anne was recalled to marry her Irish cousin, James Butler, a man several years older, who was living at the English court. The marriage was intended to settle a dispute over the title and estates of the Earldom of Ormond. Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond died in 1515, leaving his daughters, Margaret Boleyn and Anne St Leger, as co-heiresses. In Ireland, the great-great-grandson of the third earl, Sir Piers Butler, contested the will and claimed the earldom himself. He was already in possession of Kilkenny Castle, the earls&#x27; ancestral seat. Sir Thomas Boleyn, being the son of the eldest daughter, believed the title properly belonged to him and protested to his brother-in-law, the Duke of Norfolk, who spoke to the King about the matter. Henry, fearful the dispute could ignite civil war in Ireland, sought to resolve the matter by arranging an alliance between Piers&#x27;s son James and Anne Boleyn. She would bring her Ormond inheritance as dowry and thus end the dispute. The plan ended in failure, perhaps because Sir Thomas hoped for a grander marriage for his daughter or because he himself coveted the titles. Whatever the reason, the marriage negotiations came to a complete halt. James Butler later married Lady Joan Fitzgerald, daughter and heiress of James FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond and Amy O&#x27;Brien.

Mary Boleyn, Anne Boleyn&#x27;s older sister, had been recalled from France in late 1519, ostensibly to end her affairs with the French king and his courtiers. She married William Carey, a minor noble, in February 1520, at Greenwich, with Henry VIII in attendance. Soon after, Mary became the English king&#x27;s mistress. Historians dispute Henry VIII&#x27;s paternity of one or both of Mary Boleyn&#x27;s children born during this marriage. &quot;Henry VIII: The King and His Court&quot;, by Alison Weir, questions the paternity of Henry Carey; Dr G. W. Bernard (&quot;The King&#x27;s Reformation&quot;) and Joanna Denny (&quot;Anne Boleyn: A New Life of England&#x27;s Tragic Queen&quot;) argue that Henry VIII was their father. Henry did not acknowledge either child, but he did recognise his illegitimate son Henry Fitzroy, by Elizabeth Blount, Lady Talboys.

As the daughter of courtier Thomas Boleyn, by New Year 1522 Anne had gained a position at the royal court, as lady-in-waiting to Queen Catherine. Her public début at a court event was at the &quot;Château Vert&quot; (Green Castle) pageant in honour of the Imperial ambassadors on 4March 1522, playing &quot;Perseverance&quot; (one of the dancers in the spectacle, third in precedence behind Henry&#x27;s sister Mary, and Gertrude Courtenay, Marchioness of Exeter). All wore gowns of white satin embroidered with gold thread. She quickly established herself as one of the most stylish and accomplished women at the court, and soon a number of young men were competing for her.

Warnicke writes that Anne was &quot;the perfect woman courtier ... her carriage was graceful and her French clothes were pleasing and stylish; she danced with ease, had a pleasant singing voice, played the lute and several other musical instruments well, and spoke French fluently ... A remarkable, intelligent, quick-witted young noblewoman ... that first drew people into conversation with her and then amused and entertained them. In short, her energy and vitality made her the center of attention in any social gathering&quot;. Henry VIII&#x27;s biographer J. J. Scarisbrick adds that Anne &quot;revelled in&quot; the attention she received from her admirers.

During this time, Anne was courted by Henry Percy, son of the Earl of Northumberland, and entered into a secret betrothal with him. Thomas Wolsey&#x27;s gentleman usher, George Cavendish, maintained the two had not been lovers. The romance was broken off when Percy&#x27;s father refused to support their engagement. Wolsey refused the match for several conjectured reasons. According to Cavendish, Anne was sent from court to her family&#x27;s countryside estates, but it is not known for how long. Upon her return to court, she again entered the service of Catherine of Aragon. Percy was married to Lady Mary Talbot, to whom he had been betrothed since adolescence.

Before marrying Henry VIII, Anne had befriended Sir Thomas Wyatt, one of the greatest poets of the Tudor period. In 1520, Wyatt married Elizabeth Cobham, who by many accounts was not a wife of his choosing. In 1525, Wyatt charged his wife with adultery and separated from her; coincidentally, historians believe that it was also the year when his interest in Anne intensified. In 1532, Wyatt accompanied the royal couple to Calais.

In 1526, Henry VIII became enamoured of Anne and began his pursuit. Anne was a skilful player at the game of courtly love, which was often played in the antechambers. This may have been how she caught the eye of Henry, who was also an experienced player. Anne resisted Henry&#x27;s attempts to seduce her, refusing to become his mistress, and often leaving court for the seclusion of Hever Castle. But within a year, he proposed marriage to her, and she accepted. Both assumed an annulment could be obtained within months. There is no evidence to suggest that they engaged in a sexual relationship until very shortly before their marriage; Henry&#x27;s love letters to Anne suggest that their love affair remained unconsummated for much of their seven-year courtship.

=== Henry&#x27;s annulment ===
It is probable that Henry had thought of the idea of annulment (not divorce as commonly assumed) much earlier than this as he strongly desired a male heir to secure the Tudor claim to the crown. Before Henry VII ascended the throne, England was beset by civil warfare over rival claims to the crown, and Henry VIII wanted to avoid similar uncertainty over the succession. He and Catherine had no living sons: all Catherine&#x27;s children except Mary died in infancy. Catherine had first come to England to be bride to Henry&#x27;s brother Arthur, Prince of Wales, who died soon after their marriage. Since Spain and England still wanted an alliance, Pope Julius II granted a dispensation for their marriage on the grounds that Catherine was &quot;perchance&quot; () still a virgin.

Catherine and Henry married in 1509, but eventually he became dubious about the marriage&#x27;s validity, claiming that Catherine&#x27;s inability to provide an heir was a sign of God&#x27;s displeasure. His feelings for Anne, and her refusals to become his mistress, probably contributed to Henry&#x27;s decision that no pope had a right to overrule the Bible. This meant that he had been living in sin with Catherine, although Catherine hotly contested this and refused to concede that her marriage to Arthur had been consummated. It also meant that his daughter Mary was a bastard, and that the new pope (Clement VII) would have to admit the previous pope&#x27;s mistake and annul the marriage. Henry&#x27;s quest for an annulment became euphemistically known as the &quot;King&#x27;s Great Matter&quot;.

Anne saw an opportunity in Henry&#x27;s infatuation and the convenient moral quandary. She determined that she would yield to his embraces only as his acknowledged queen. She began to take her place at his side in policy and in state, but not yet in his bed.

Scholars and historians hold various opinions as to how deep Anne&#x27;s commitment to the Reformation was, how much she was perhaps only personally ambitious, and how much she had to do with Henry&#x27;s defiance of papal power: Ives, Maria Dowling and David Starkey are among those who believe that she was a devout evangelical, whereas Warnicke and George Bernard hold that her religious beliefs were &quot;conventional&quot;. Warnicke acknowledges that Anne promoted vernacular (French or English) editions of the bible, but remained, &quot;deep seated[ly], a Catholic&quot;. There is anecdotal evidence, related to biographer George Wyatt by her former lady-in-waiting Anne Gainsford, that Anne brought to Henry&#x27;s attention a heretical pamphlet, perhaps William Tyndale&#x27;s &quot;The Obedience of a Christian Man&quot; or one by Simon Fish called &quot;A Supplication for the Beggars&quot;, which cried out to monarchs to rein in the evil excesses of the Catholic Church. She was sympathetic to those seeking further reformation of the Church, and actively protected scholars working on English translations of the scriptures. According to Maria Dowling, &quot;Anne tried to educate her waiting-women in scriptural piety&quot; and is believed to have reproved her cousin, Mary Shelton, for &quot;having &#x27;idle poesies&#x27; written in her prayer book.&quot;

In 1528, sweating sickness broke out with great severity. In London, the mortality rate was great and the court was dispersed. Henry left London, frequently changing his residence; Anne Boleyn retreated to the Boleyn residence at Hever Castle, but contracted the illness; her brother-in-law, William Carey, died. Henry sent his own physician to Hever Castle to care for Anne, and shortly afterwards she recovered.

Henry was soon absorbed in securing an annulment from Catherine. He set his hopes upon a direct appeal to the Holy See, acting independently of Wolsey, to whom he at first communicated nothing of his plans. In 1527 William Knight, the King&#x27;s secretary, was sent to Pope Clement VII to sue for the annulment of Henry&#x27;s marriage to Catherine, on the grounds that the dispensing bull of Julius II permitting him to marry his brother&#x27;s widow, Catherine, had been obtained under false pretences. Henry also petitioned, in the event of his becoming free, a dispensation to contract a new marriage with any woman even in the first degree of affinity, whether the affinity was contracted by lawful or unlawful connection. This referred to Anne.

As Clement was at that time a prisoner of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, as a result of the Sack of Rome in May 1527, Knight had some difficulty obtaining access. In the end he had to return with a conditional dispensation, which Wolsey insisted was technically insufficient. Henry then had no choice but to put his great matter into Wolsey&#x27;s hands, who did all he could to secure a decision in Henry&#x27;s favour, even going so far as to convene an ecclesiastical court in England, with a special emissary, Lorenzo Campeggio, from Clement to decide the matter. But Clement had not empowered his deputy to make a decision. He was still CharlesV&#x27;s hostage, and CharlesV was loyal to his aunt Catherine. The Pope forbade Henry to contract a new marriage until a decision was reached in Rome, not in England. Convinced that Wolsey&#x27;s loyalties lay with the Pope, not England, Anne, as well as Wolsey&#x27;s many enemies, ensured his dismissal from public office in 1529. Cavendish, Wolsey&#x27;s chamberlain, records that the servants who waited on the King and Anne at dinner in 1529 in Grafton heard her say that the dishonour Wolsey had brought upon the realm would have cost any other Englishman his head. Henry replied, &quot;Why then I perceive ... you are not the Cardinal&#x27;s friend.&quot;. Henry finally agreed to Wolsey&#x27;s arrest on grounds of &quot;praemunire&quot;. Had it not been for his death from illness in 1530, Wolsey might have been executed for treason. In 1531 (two years before Henry&#x27;s marriage to Anne), Catherine was banished from court and her rooms given to Anne.

Public support remained with Catherine. One evening, in the autumn of 1531, Anne was dining at a manor house on the River Thames and was almost seized by a crowd of angry women. Anne just managed to escape by boat.

When Archbishop of Canterbury William Warham died in 1532, the Boleyn family chaplain, Thomas Cranmer, was appointed, with papal approval.

In 1532, Thomas Cromwell brought before Parliament a number of acts, including the Supplication against the Ordinaries and Submission of the Clergy, which recognised royal supremacy over the church, thus finalising the break with Rome. Following these acts, Thomas More resigned as Lord Chancellor, leaving Cromwell as Henry&#x27;s chief minister.

=== Premarital role and marriage ===
Even before her marriage, Anne Boleyn was able to grant petitions, receive diplomats and give patronage, and had an influence over Henry to plead the cause of foreign diplomats.

During this period, Anne played an important role in England&#x27;s international position by solidifying an alliance with France. She established an excellent rapport with the French ambassador, Gilles de la Pommeraie. On 1September 1532, Henry granted Anne the Marquessate of Pembroke, an appropriate peerage for a future queen. Anne was a former lady-in-waiting at the French court, and the new title was a necessary mark of her new status before she and Henry attended a meeting with the French king Francis I at Calais in winter 1532. Henry hoped to enlist Francis&#x27;s public support for the intended marriage. Henry performed the investiture himself, with de la Pommeraie as guest of honour.

The conference at Calais was a political triumph, but even though the French government gave implicit support for Henry&#x27;s remarriage and Francis I had a private conference with Anne, the French king maintained alliances with the Pope that he could not explicitly defy.

Anne&#x27;s family also profited from the relationship. Her father, already Viscount Rochford, was created Earl of Wiltshire. Henry also came to an arrangement with Anne&#x27;s Irish cousin and created him Earl of Ormond. At the magnificent banquet to celebrate her father&#x27;s elevation, Anne took precedence over the Duchesses of Suffolk and Norfolk, seated in the place of honour beside the King that was usually occupied by the Queen. Thanks to Anne&#x27;s intervention, her widowed sister Mary received an annual pension of £100 (although later, when Mary remarried, Anne was to countermand this) and Mary&#x27;s son, Henry Carey, was educated at the prestigious Brigettine nunnery of Syon Abbey. Anne arranged for Nicholas Bourbon, exiled from France for his support for religious reform, to be Henry&#x27;s tutor there.

Soon after returning to Dover, Henry and Anne married in a secret ceremony on 14 November 1532. She soon became pregnant and as the first wedding was considered to be unlawful at the time, a second wedding service, also private in accordance with the precedents established in &quot;The Royal Book&quot;, took place in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer (who had been hastened, with the Pope&#x27;s assent, into the position of Archbishop of Canterbury recently vacated by the death of Warham) sat in judgement at a special court convened at Dunstable Priory to rule on the validity of Henry&#x27;s marriage to Catherine. He declared it null and void. Five days later, on 28 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne good and valid.
== Queen of England: 1533–1536 ==

Catherine was formally stripped of her title as queen and Anne was consequently crowned queen consort on 1June 1533 in a magnificent ceremony at Westminster Abbey with a banquet afterwards. She was the last queen consort of England to be crowned separately from her husband. Unlike any other queen consort, Anne was crowned with St Edward&#x27;s Crown, which had previously been used to crown only monarchs. Historian Alice Hunt suggests that this was done because Anne&#x27;s pregnancy was visible by then and the child was presumed to be male. On the previous day, Anne had taken part in an elaborate procession through the streets of London seated in a litter of &quot;white cloth of gold&quot; that rested on two palfreys clothed to the ground in white damask, while the barons of the Cinque Ports held a canopy of cloth of gold over her head. In accordance with tradition, she wore white, and on her head, a gold coronet beneath which her long dark hair hung down freely. The public&#x27;s response to her appearance was lukewarm.

Meanwhile, the House of Commons had forbidden all appeals to Rome and exacted the penalties of &quot;praemunire&quot; against all who introduced papal bulls into England, by introducing the Ecclesiastical Appeals Act 1532 (24 Hen. 8 c. 12). It was only then that Pope Clement, at last, took the step of announcing a provisional excommunication of Henry and Cranmer. He condemned the marriage to Anne, and in March 1534 declared the marriage to Catherine legal and again ordered Henry to return to her. Henry now required his subjects to swear an oath attached to the First Succession Act, which effectively rejected papal authority in legal matters and recognised Anne Boleyn as queen. Those who refused, such as Sir Thomas More, who had resigned as Lord Chancellor, and John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, were placed in the Tower of London. In late 1534 parliament declared Henry &quot;the only supreme head on earth of the Church of England&quot;. The Church in England was now under Henry&#x27;s control, not Rome&#x27;s. On 14 May 1534, in one of the realm&#x27;s first official acts protecting Protestant Reformers, Anne wrote a letter to Thomas Cromwell seeking his aid in ensuring that English merchant Richard Herman be reinstated a member of the merchant adventurers in Antwerp and no longer persecuted simply because he had helped in &quot;setting forth of the New testament in English&quot;. Before and after her coronation, Anne protected and promoted evangelicals and those wishing to study the scriptures of William Tyndale. She had a decisive role in influencing the Protestant reformer Matthew Parker to attend court as her chaplain, and before her death entrusted her daughter to Parker&#x27;s care.

=== Struggle for a son ===
After her coronation, Anne settled into a quiet routine at the King&#x27;s favourite residence, Greenwich Palace, to prepare for the birth of her baby. The child was a girl, born slightly prematurely on 7September 1533. She was christened Elizabeth, probably in honour of either Anne&#x27;s mother Elizabeth Howard or Henry&#x27;s mother Elizabeth of York, or both. The birth of a girl was a heavy blow to her parents, who had confidently expected a boy. All but one of the royal physicians and astrologers had predicted a son and the French king had been asked to stand as his godfather. Now the prepared letters announcing the birth of a &quot;prince&quot; had an &quot;s&quot; hastily added to them to read &quot;princes[s]&quot; and the traditional jousting tournament for the birth of an heir was cancelled.
The infant princess was given a splendid christening, but Anne feared that Catherine&#x27;s daughter Mary, now stripped of her title of princess and labelled a bastard, posed a threat to Elizabeth&#x27;s position. Henry soothed his wife&#x27;s fears by separating Mary from her many servants and sending her to live at Hatfield House, where Elizabeth would also reside with her own sizeable staff of servants as the country air was thought better for the baby&#x27;s health. Anne frequently visited her daughter at Hatfield and other residences.

The new queen had a larger staff of servants than Catherine. There were more than 250 servants to tend to her personal needs, from priests to stable boys, and more than 60 maids-of-honour who served her and accompanied her to social events. She also employed several priests to act as her confessors, chaplains and religious advisers. One of these was Matthew Parker, who became one of the chief architects of Anglican thought during the reign of Anne&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth I.

=== Strife with the king ===
The King and his new queen enjoyed a reasonably happy accord with periods of calm and affection. Anne&#x27;s sharp intelligence, political acumen and forward manner, although desirable in a mistress, were at the time unacceptable in a wife. She was once reported to have spoken to her uncle in words that &quot;shouldn&#x27;t be used to a dog&quot;. After miscarriage or stillbirth in summer 1534, Henry was discussing with Cranmer and Cromwell the possibility of divorcing her without having to return to Catherine. Nothing came of the matter as the royal couple reconciled and spent the summer of 1535 on progress, visiting Gloucester and hunting in the local countryside. By October, she was again pregnant.

Anne presided over a court within the royal household. She spent lavish amounts of money on gowns, jewels, head-dresses, ostrich-feather fans, riding equipment, furniture and upholstery, maintaining the ostentatious display required by her status. Numerous palaces were renovated to suit the extravagant tastes she and Henry shared. Her motto was &quot;The most happy&quot;, and she chose a white falcon as her personal device.

Anne was blamed for Henry&#x27;s tyranny and called by some of her subjects &quot;the king&#x27;s whore&quot; or a &quot;naughty paike [prostitute]&quot;. Public opinion turned further against her after the marriage produced no male heir. It sank even lower after the executions of her enemies More and Fisher.

== Downfall and execution: 1536 ==
On 8 January 1536, news of Catherine of Aragon&#x27;s death reached Anne and the King, who was overjoyed. The following day, Henry wore yellow, a symbol of joy and celebration in England but of mourning in Spain, from head to toe, and celebrated Catherine&#x27;s death with festivities. With Catherine dead, Anne attempted to make peace with Mary. Mary rebuffed Anne&#x27;s overtures, perhaps because of rumours circulating that Catherine had been poisoned by Anne or Henry. These began after the discovery during her embalming that Catherine&#x27;s heart was blackened. Modern medical experts are in agreement that this was not the result of poisoning, but from heart cancer, the cause of her death and an extremely rare condition that was not understood at the time.

Queen Anne, pregnant again, was aware of the dangers if she failed to give birth to a son. With Catherine dead, Henry would be free to marry without any taint of illegality. At this time, Henry began paying court to one of Anne&#x27;s maids-of-honour, Jane Seymour, and allegedly gave her a locket containing a portrait miniature of himself. While wearing this locket in the presence of Anne, Jane began opening and closing it. Anne responded by ripping the locket off Jane&#x27;s neck with such force that her fingers bled.

Later that month, the King was unhorsed in a tournament and knocked unconscious for two hours, a worrying incident that Anne believed led to her miscarriage five days later. Another possible cause of the miscarriage was an incident in which, upon entering a room, Anne saw Jane Seymour sitting on Henry&#x27;s lap and flew into a rage. Whatever the cause, on the day that Catherine of Aragon was buried at Peterborough Abbey, Anne miscarried a baby which, according to the Imperial ambassador Eustace Chapuys, she had borne for about three and a half months, and which &quot;seemed to be a male child&quot;. Chapuys commented &quot;She has miscarried of her saviour.&quot; In Chapuys&#x27;s opinion, this loss was the beginning of the end of the royal marriage.

Given Henry&#x27;s desperate desire for a son, the sequence of Anne&#x27;s pregnancies has attracted much interest. Mike Ashley speculated that Anne had two stillborn children after Elizabeth&#x27;s birth and before the male child she miscarried in 1536. Gynaecologist John Dewhurst studied the sequence of the birth of Elizabeth in September 1533 and the series of reported miscarriages that followed, including the miscarriage of a male child of almost four months&#x27; gestation in January 1536, and postulates that, instead of a series of miscarriages, Anne was experiencing pseudocyesis, a condition &quot;occur[ing] in women desperate to prove their fertility&quot;.

As Anne recovered from her miscarriage, Henry declared that he had been seduced into the marriage by means of &quot;&quot; – a French term indicating either &quot;deception&quot; or &quot;spells&quot;. His new favourite Jane Seymour was quickly moved into royal quarters at Greenwich; Jane&#x27;s brother Edward and his wife, for the sake of propriety, moved with her. This was followed by Anne&#x27;s brother George Boleyn&#x27;s being refused the prestigious honour of the Order of the Garter, given instead to Sir Nicholas Carew.

=== Charges of adultery, incest and treason ===
Anne&#x27;s biographer Eric Ives believes that her fall and execution were primarily engineered by her former ally Thomas Cromwell. The conversations between Chapuys and Cromwell indicate Cromwell as the instigator of the plot to remove Anne; evidence of this is seen through letters written from Chapuys to CharlesV. Anne argued with Cromwell over the redistribution of Church revenues and over foreign policy. She advocated that revenues be distributed to charitable and educational institutions; and she favoured a French alliance. Cromwell preferred an Imperial alliance and insisted on filling the King&#x27;s depleted coffers. For these reasons, Ives suggests, &quot;Anne Boleyn had become a major threat to Thomas Cromwell.&quot; Cromwell&#x27;s biographer John Schofield, on the other hand, contends that no power struggle existed between Anne and Cromwell and that &quot;not a trace can be found of a Cromwellian conspiracy against Anne ... Cromwell became involved in the royal marital drama only when Henry ordered him onto the case.&quot; Schofield claims that evidence for the power struggle between Anne and Cromwell comprises no more than &quot;fly-by-night stories from Alesius and the &quot;Spanish Chronicle&quot;, words of Chapuys taken out of context, and an untrustworthy translation of the &quot;Calendar of State Papers&quot;.&quot; Cromwell did not manufacture the accusations of adultery, though he and other officials used them to bolster Henry&#x27;s case against Anne. Warnicke questions whether Cromwell could have or wished to manipulate the King in such a matter. Such a bold attempt by Cromwell, given the limited evidence, could have risked his office, even his life. Henry himself issued the crucial instructions: his officials, including Cromwell, carried them out. The result was by modern standards a legal travesty; however, the rules of the time were not bent in order to assure a conviction; there was no need to tamper with rules that guaranteed the desired result since law at the time was an engine of state, not a mechanism for justice.

Towards the end of April, a Flemish musician in Anne&#x27;s service named Mark Smeaton was arrested. He initially denied being the Queen&#x27;s lover but later confessed, perhaps after being tortured or promised freedom. Another courtier, Sir Henry Norris, was arrested on May Day, but being an aristocrat, could not be tortured. Prior to his arrest, Norris was treated kindly by the King, who offered him his own horse to use on the May Day festivities. It seems likely that during the festivities, the King was notified of Smeaton&#x27;s confession and it was shortly thereafter the alleged conspirators were arrested upon his orders. Norris denied his guilt and swore that Queen Anne was innocent; one of the most damaging pieces of evidence against Norris was an overheard conversation with Anne at the end of April, where she accused him of coming often to her chambers not to pay court to her lady-in-waiting Madge Shelton but to herself. Sir Francis Weston was arrested two days later on the same charge, as was Sir William Brereton, a groom of the King&#x27;s Privy Chamber. Sir Thomas Wyatt, the poet and friend of the Boleyns who was allegedly infatuated with her before her marriage to the King, was also imprisoned for the same charge but later released, most likely due to his or his family&#x27;s friendship with Cromwell. Sir Richard Page was also accused of having a sexual relationship with the Queen, but he was acquitted of all charges after further investigation could not implicate him with Anne. The final accused was Queen Anne&#x27;s own brother, George Boleyn, arrested on charges of incest and treason. He was accused of two incidents of incest: November 1535 at Whitehall and the following month at Eltham.

On 2 May 1536 Anne was arrested and taken to the Tower of London. In the Tower, initially she became hysterical, demanding to know the location of her father and her &quot;sweet brother&quot;, as well as the charges against her. The charge was treason, in that she and the other defendants had intended Henry&#x27;s death: the shock of the news of her adultery was alleged to have put his life at risk. Anne was taken by barge from Greenwich to The Tower and lodged in the royal apartments.

In what is reputed to be her last letter to Henry, dated 6 May, she wrote:

Four of the accused men were tried in Westminster on 12 May 1536. Weston, Brereton and Norris publicly maintained their innocence and only Smeaton supported the Crown by pleading guilty. Three days later, Anne and George Boleyn were tried separately in the Tower of London, before a jury of 27 peers. She was accused of adultery, incest, and high treason. The treason alleged against her (after Cromwell had used the nine days of her imprisonment to develop his case) was that of plotting the King&#x27;s death, with her &quot;lovers&quot;, so that she might later marry Henry Norris. Anne&#x27;s one-time betrothed, Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland, sat on the jury that unanimously found Anne guilty. When the verdict was announced, he collapsed and had to be carried from the courtroom. He died childless eight months later and was succeeded by his nephew.

On 17 May, Cranmer declared Anne&#x27;s marriage to Henry null and void.

=== Final hours ===
The accused were found guilty and condemned to death. George Boleyn and the other accused men were executed on 17May 1536. William Kingston, the Constable of the Tower, reported that Anne seemed very happy and ready to be done with life. Henry commuted Anne&#x27;s sentence from burning to beheading, and rather than have a queen beheaded with the common axe, he brought an expert swordsman from Saint-Omer in France to perform the execution.

An anonymous manuscript of a poem &quot;O Death Rock Me Asleep&quot; that came into the possession of prolific 18th-century author John Hawkins, and now in the British Museum, was thought to be in the style of &quot;the time of Henry VIII&quot;. On this weak premise, Hawkins conjectured that the writer was &quot;very probabl[y]&quot; Anne Boleyn, writing after her conviction. &quot;Defiled is my Name&quot;, a similar lament, is also attributed to Anne. According to Ives, she could not have produced any such writings while under the scrutiny of the ladies set to watch over her in the Tower. Mary Joiner of the Royal Musical Association examined the BM documents and concluded that the attributions, although held in wide belief, are no more than an &quot;improbable ... legend&quot;.

On the morning of 19 May, Kingston wrote:

Shortly before dawn, she called Kingston to hear mass with her and swore in his presence, on the eternal salvation of her soul and upon the Holy Sacraments, that she had never been unfaithful to the King. She ritually repeated this oath immediately before and after receiving the sacrament of the Eucharist.

On the morning of Friday 19 May, Anne was taken to a scaffold erected on the north side of the White Tower. She wore a red petticoat under a loose, dark grey gown of damask trimmed in fur, and a mantle of ermine. Accompanied by two female attendants, Anne made her final walk from the Queen&#x27;s House to the scaffold; she showed a &quot;devilish spirit&quot; and looked &quot;as gay as if she was not going to die&quot;. She climbed the scaffold and made a short speech to the crowd:

This version of her speech is found in John Foxe&#x27;s &quot;Actes and Monuments&quot; (also known as &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot;).

Lancelot de Carle, a secretary to the French Ambassador, Antoine de Castelnau, was in London in May 1536, and was an eyewitness to her trial and execution. Two weeks after Anne&#x27;s death, de Carle composed the 1,318-line poem &quot;Épistre Contenant le Procès Criminel Faict à l&#x27;Encontre de la Royne Anne Boullant d&#x27;Angleterre&quot; (&quot;A Letter Containing the Criminal Charges Laid Against Queen Anne Boleyn of England&quot;), which provides a moving account of her last words and their effect on the crowd:

It is thought that Anne avoided criticising Henry because she wished to save Elizabeth and her family from further consequences, but even under such extreme pressure, she did not confess guilt and indeed subtly implied her innocence in her appeal to those who might &quot;meddle of my cause&quot;.

=== Death and burial ===
The ermine mantle was removed, and Anne lifted off her headdress and tucked her hair under a coif. After a brief farewell to her weeping ladies and a request for prayers, she knelt down; one of the ladies tied a blindfold over Anne&#x27;s eyes. She knelt upright, in the French style of beheadings. Her final prayer consisted of her continually repeating, &quot;Jesu receive my soul; O Lord God have pity on my soul.&quot;

The execution, which consisted of a single stroke, was witnessed by Thomas Cromwell; Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk; the King&#x27;s illegitimate son, Henry FitzRoy; and Sir Ralph Warren, Lord Mayor of London, as well as aldermen, sheriffs and representatives of the various craft guilds. Most of the King&#x27;s Council was also present. Cranmer, who was at Lambeth Palace, reportedly broke down in tears after telling Alexander Ales, &quot;She who has been the Queen of England on earth will today become a Queen in heaven.&quot; When the charges were first brought against Anne, Cranmer had expressed his astonishment to Henry and his belief that &quot;she should not be culpable&quot;.

Cranmer felt vulnerable because of his closeness to the Queen; on the night before the execution, he declared Henry&#x27;s marriage to Anne to have been void, like Catherine&#x27;s before her. He made no serious attempt to save Anne&#x27;s life, although some sources record that he had prepared her for death by hearing her last private confession of sins, in which she had stated her innocence before God.

She was buried in an unmarked grave in the Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula at the Tower of London. Her skeleton was identified during renovations of the chapel in 1876, in the reign of Queen Victoria, and reinterred there in 1877. Her grave is now clearly marked on the marble floor, although the historian Alison Weir believes that the bones identified as belonging to Anne might in fact be those of Catherine Howard.

== Recognition and legacy ==
Nicholas Sanders, a Catholic recusant born , was committed to deposing Elizabeth I and re-establishing Catholicism in England. In his &quot;De Origine ac Progressu schismatis Anglicani&quot; (&quot;The Rise and Growth of the Anglican Schism&quot;), published in 1585, he was the first to write that Anne had six fingers on her right hand. Since physical deformities were generally interpreted as a sign of evil, it is unlikely that Anne Boleyn would have gained Henry&#x27;s romantic attention had she had any. Upon exhumation in 1876, no abnormalities were discovered. Her frame was described as delicate, approximately , &quot;the hand and feet bones indicated delicate and well-shaped hands and feet, with tapering fingers and a narrow foot&quot;.

Anne Boleyn was described by contemporaries as intelligent and gifted in musical arts and scholarly pursuits. She was also strong-willed and proud, and often quarrelled with Henry. Biographer Eric Ives evaluates the apparent contradictions in Anne&#x27;s persona:
Following the coronation of her daughter as queen, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of John Foxe, who argued that Anne had saved England from the evils of Roman Catholicism and that God had provided proof of her innocence and virtue by making sure her daughter Elizabeth I ascended the throne. An example of Anne&#x27;s direct influence in the reformed church is what Alexander Ales described to Queen Elizabeth as the &quot;evangelical bishops whom your holy mother appointed from among those scholars who favoured the purer doctrine&quot;. Over the centuries, Anne has inspired or been mentioned in numerous artistic and cultural works. As a result, she has remained in the popular memory and has been called &quot;the most influential and important queen consort England has ever had.&quot;

==Appearance and portraits==
Anne&#x27;s appearance has been much discussed by historians, as all of her portraits were destroyed following an order by Henry VIII, who wanted to erase her from history. Many surviving depictions of her may be copies of a lost original that apparently existed as late as 1773. One of the few contemporary likenesses of Anne was captured on a medal referred to as &quot;The Moost Happi Medal&quot; which was struck in 1536, probably to celebrate her pregnancy which occurred around that time. The other possible portrait of Anne was a secret locket ring that her daughter Elizabeth I possessed and was taken from one of her fingers at her death in 1603. 

Another possible portrait of Anne was discovered in 2015 painted by artist Nidd Hall. Some scholars believe that it portrays Anne because it resembles the 1536 medal more than any other depiction. However, others believe that it is actually a portrait of her successor Jane Seymour.

===Holbein sketches===
 
Hans Holbein the Younger originally painted Anne&#x27;s portrait and also sketched her during her lifetime. There are two surviving sketches that have been identified to be of Anne, by historians and people who knew her. Most scholars believe that Anne cannot be one of the two, as the portrayals do not look similar to each other, whilst others think that they do show the same woman but in one sketch she is pregnant, whilst in the other she is not.

She was considered brilliant, charming, driven, elegant, forthright and graceful, with a keen wit and a lively, opinionated and passionate personality. Anne was depicted as &quot;sweet and cheerful&quot; in her youth and enjoyed cards and dice games, drinking wine, French cuisine, flirting, gambling, gossiping and good jokes. She was fond of archery, falconry, hunting and the occasional game of bowls. She also had a sharp tongue and a terrible temper.
Anne exerted a powerful charm on those who met her, though opinions differed on her attractiveness. The Venetian diarist Marino Sanuto the Younger, who saw Anne when Henry VIII met Francis I at Calais in October 1532, described her as &quot;not one of the handsomest women in the world; she is of middling stature, swarthy complexion, long neck, wide mouth, bosom not much raised ... eyes, which are black and beautiful&quot;. Simon Grynée wrote to Martin Bucer in September 1531 that Anne was &quot;young, good-looking, of a rather dark complexion&quot;. Lancelot de Carle called her &quot;beautiful with an elegant figure&quot;, and a Venetian in Paris in 1528 also reported that she was said to be beautiful.
The most influential description of Anne, but also the least reliable, was written by the Catholic propagandist and polemicist Nicholas Sanders in 1586, half a century after Anne&#x27;s death: 
As Sander held Anne responsible for Henry VIII&#x27;s rejection of the Catholic Church he was keen to demonise her. Sanders description contributed to what Ives calls the &quot;monster legend&quot; of Anne Boleyn. Though his details were fictitious, they have formed the basis for references to Anne&#x27;s appearance even in some modern textbooks.

== Faith and spirituality ==

Because of Anne&#x27;s early exposure to court life, she had powerful influences around her for most of her life. These early influences were mostly women who were engaged with art, history and religion. Eric Ives described the women around Anne as &quot;aristocratic women seeking spiritual fulfillment&quot;. They included Queen Claude, of whose court Anne was a member, and Marguerite of Angoulême, who was a well-known figure during the Renaissance and held strong religious views that she expressed through poetry. These women along with Anne&#x27;s immediate family members, such as her father, may have had a large influence on Anne&#x27;s personal faith.

Anne&#x27;s experience in France made her a devout Christian in the new tradition of Renaissance humanism. Anne knew little Latin and, trained at a French court, she was influenced by an &quot;evangelical variety of French humanism&quot;, which led her to champion the vernacular Bible. She later held the reformist position that the papacy was a corrupting influence on Christianity, but her conservative tendencies could be seen in her devotion to the Virgin Mary. Anne&#x27;s European education ended in 1521, when her father summoned her back to England. She sailed from Calais in January 1522.

Another clue to Anne&#x27;s personal faith could be found in Anne&#x27;s book of hours, in which she wrote, &quot;le temps viendra&quot; [&quot;the time will come&quot;]. Alongside this inscription, she drew an armillary sphere, an emblem (also used by her daughter Elizabeth) representing contemplation of heavenly wisdom.

Anne Boleyn&#x27;s last words before her beheading were a prayer for her salvation, her king, and her country. She said, &quot;Good Christian people! I am come hither to die, for according to the law, and by the law, I am judged to death; and therefore I will speak nothing against it. I come hither to accuse no man, nor to any thing of that whereof I am accused and condemned to die; but I pray God save the king, and send him long to reign over you, for a gentler, or a more merciful prince was there never; and to me he was ever a good, a gentle, and a sovereign lord.&quot; John Foxe, martyrologist, included Anne in his book, &quot;Actes and Monuments&quot;, claiming she was a good woman who had sincere faith and trust in her God. Foxe also believed a sign of Anne&#x27;s good faith was God&#x27;s blessing on her daughter, Elizabeth I, and God allowing Elizabeth to prosper as queen.

== Legends ==
Many legends and stories about Anne Boleyn have existed over the centuries. One is that she was secretly buried in Salle Church in Norfolk under a black slab near the tombs of her ancestors. Her body was said to have rested in an Essex church on its journey to Norfolk. Another is that her heart, at her request, was buried in Erwarton (Arwarton) Church, Suffolk by her uncle Sir Philip Parker.

In 18th-century Sicily, the peasants of the village of Nicolosi believed that Anne Boleyn, for having made Henry VIII a heretic, was condemned to burn for eternity inside Mount Etna. This legend was often told for the benefit of foreign travellers.

A number of people have claimed to have seen Anne&#x27;s ghost at Hever Castle, Blickling Hall, Salle Church, the Tower of London and Marwell Hall. One account of her reputed sighting was given by paranormal researcher Hans Holzer. In 1864, Captain (later Major General) J. D. Dundas of the 60th Rifles regiment was billeted in the Tower of London. As he was looking out the window of his quarters, he noticed a guard below in the courtyard, in front of the lodgings where Anne had been imprisoned, behaving strangely. He appeared to challenge something, which to Dundas &quot;looked like a whitish, female figure sliding towards the soldier&quot;. The guard charged through the form with his bayonet, then fainted. Only the captain&#x27;s testimony and corroboration at the court-martial saved the guard from a lengthy prison sentence for having fainted while on duty.

<doc id="39357" wikidata="Q122195" url="?curid=39357" title="Tequila">
<text>Tequila (; ) is a distilled beverage made from the blue agave plant, primarily in the area surrounding the city of Tequila northwest of Guadalajara, and in the Jaliscan Highlands (&quot;Los Altos de Jalisco&quot;) of the central western Mexican state of Jalisco.

The red volcanic soils in the region of Tequila are well suited for growing the blue agave, and more than 300 million plants are harvested there each year. Agave grows differently depending on the region. Blue agaves grown in the highlands Los Altos region are larger and sweeter in aroma and taste. Agaves harvested in the valley region have a more herbaceous fragrance and flavor. Due to its historical and cultural importance, the region near Tequila was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006, the &quot;Agave Landscape and Ancient Industrial Facilities of Tequila&quot;.

Mexican laws state that tequila can be produced only in the state of Jalisco and limited municipalities in the states of Guanajuato, Michoacán, Nayarit, and Tamaulipas. Tequila is recognized as a Mexican designation of origin product in more than 40 countries. It was protected through NAFTA in Canada and the United States until July 2020 and through bilateral agreements with individual countries such as Japan and Israel, and it has been a protected designation of origin product in the European Union since 1997.

Aside from its geographical distinction, tequila is differentiated from other varieties of mezcal in that all of the agave used in tequila is blue agave, and the methods of production are different. Tequila is commonly served neat in Mexico and as a shot with salt and lime around the world. Tequila must have between 35% and 55% alcohol content (70 and 110 U.S. proof).

==History==

===Early history===
Prior to the production of either tequila or mezcal, pulque had been brewed from agave sap for thousands of years. However, pulque is only fermented, not distilled. The distillation technology to produce mezcal from agave heart juice was first introduced by Filipino sailors and migrants into the coastal regions of what was then Nueva Galicia (present-day Aguascalientes, Colima, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Nayarit, and Zacatecas). Mezcal distillation then spread into the highland valleys of Amatitán, Tequila, Magdalena, and El Arenal in the mid-1700s. The mezcal produced in these regions became distinctive enough as to become known as &quot;tequila&quot; (after the town).

Don Pedro Sánchez de Tagle is considered the first person to produce tequila. In 1595, King Philip II of Spain banned the planting of new vineyards in Mexico and other Spanish colonies due to the decline of wine trade with Spain. The main reason behind this is because Mexico is self-sufficient in producing its own wines. The king did this to maintain the market for Spanish products in the New World, and reap the taxes on Spanish wine exports. The Marquis of Altamira grabbed the opportunity of the neglected blue agave plants. He built his first Tequila factory in his Hacienda Cuisillos, one of the largest haciendas during that time and amassed a great fortune. The Marquis is now known today as the &quot;Father of Tequila&quot;. Don Pedro also served as the Prior of the Consulado, which is the head of the largest corporation in Mexico.

Spain&#x27;s King Carlos IV granted the Cuervo family the first legal license to commercially make tequila. Don Cenobio Sauza, founder of Sauza Tequila and Municipal President of the Village of Tequila from 1884 to 1885, was the first to export tequila to the United States. Don Cenobio&#x27;s grandson Don Francisco Javier gained international attention for insisting that &quot;there cannot be tequila where there are no agaves!&quot; His efforts led to the principle that real tequila can come only from the State of Jalisco.

The first tequila distillery in the United States was opened in 1936 in Nogales, Arizona by Harry J. Karns, former Arizona state senator and Nogales Mayor.

In a move to take ownership of the term &quot;tequila&quot;, the Mexican government declared the term to be its intellectual property in 1974.

=== Recent history ===
Although some tequilas have remained as family-owned brands, most well-known tequila brands are owned by large multinational corporations. Over 100 distilleries make over 900 brands of tequila in Mexico and over 2,000 brand names have been registered (2009 statistics). Due to this, each bottle of tequila contains a serial number (NOM) denoting in which distillery the tequila was produced. In many cases, multiple different brands come from the same manufacturer.

In 2003, Mexico issued a proposal that would require all Mexican-made tequila be bottled in Mexico before being exported to other countries. The Mexican government said that bottling tequila in Mexico would guarantee its quality. Liquor companies in the United States said Mexico just wanted to create bottling jobs in their own country, and also claimed this rule would violate international trade agreements and was in discord with usual exporting practices worldwide. The proposal might have resulted in the loss of jobs at plants in California, Arkansas, Missouri, and Kentucky, because Mexican tequila exported in bulk to the United States is bottled in those plants. On January 17, 2006, the United States and Mexico signed an agreement allowing the continued bulk import of tequila into the United States. The agreement also created a &quot;tequila bottlers registry&quot; to identify approved bottlers of tequila and created an agency to monitor the registry.

The Tequila Regulatory Council of Mexico (TRCM) originally did not permit flavored tequila to carry the tequila name. In 2004, the Council decided to allow flavored tequila to be called tequila, with the exception of 100% agave tequila, which still cannot be flavored.

A new &quot;Norma Oficial Mexicana&quot; (NOM) for tequila (NOM-006-SCFI-2005) was issued in 2006 and, among other changes, introduced a class of tequila called &quot;extra añejo&quot; or &quot;ultra-aged&quot;, which must be aged a minimum of three years.

A one-liter bottle of limited-edition premium tequila was sold for $225,000 in July 2006 in Tequila, Jalisco, by the company Tequila Ley .925. The bottle that contained the tequila was a two-kilo display of platinum and gold. The manufacturer received a certificate from The Guinness World Records for the most expensive bottle of tequila spirit ever sold.

In June 2013, a Chinese ban on the importation of premium (100% blue agave) tequila into China was lifted, following a state visit to Mexico by Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping. The entry of premium tequila into the country was expected to increase tequila exports by 20 percent within the decade above the 170 million liters in 2013. Ramon Gonzalez, director of the &quot;Consejo Regulador del Tequila&quot;, estimates that each of the top 16 producers of tequila had invested up to $3 million to enter the Chinese market. On 30 August 2013, the first 70,380 bottles of premium tequila from ten brands arrived in Shanghai. The arrival happened during an event held at the House of Roosevelt, a well-known club located on The Bund – an area with a long tradition of importing alcoholic beverages in China.

The latest version of the tequila standard (NOM-006-SCFI-2012) updated the standard to specify that the silver class of tequila cannot contain additives, to allow the aging time for the ultra-aged class to be displayed on the label, and to prohibit the selling of bulk tequila through vending machines, and required registering the agave during the calendar year of its plantation and required annual updates.

In 2018, the Mexican government approved a proposal to celebrate the third Saturday of March as National Tequila Day.

==Production==

Tequila is made from the blue agave plant, primarily in the area surrounding the city of Tequila northwest of Guadalajara, and in the Jaliscan Highlands (&quot;Los Altos de Jalisco&quot;) of the central western Mexican state of Jalisco. Aside from its geographical distinction, tequila is differentiated from other varieties of mezcal in that all of the agave used in tequila is blue agave, and the methods of production are different.

The red volcanic soils in the region of Tequila are well suited for growing the blue agave, and more than 300 million plants are harvested there each year. Agave grows differently depending on the region. Blue agaves grown in the highlands Los Altos region are larger and sweeter in aroma and taste. Agaves harvested in the valley region have a more herbaceous fragrance and flavor. Due to its historical and cultural importance, the region near Tequila was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006, the &quot;Agave Landscape and Ancient Industrial Facilities of Tequila&quot;.

Planting, tending, and harvesting the agave plant remains a manual effort, largely unchanged by modern farm machinery and relying on centuries-old expertise. The people who harvest it, the , have intimate knowledge of how the plants should be cultivated, passed down from generation to generation.

By regularly trimming any (a stalk at the center of the plant that could grow several meters high if not cut back), the prevent the agave from flowering and dying early, allowing it to fully ripen. They also determine when each plant is ready to be harvested, and using a special knife called a (with a circular blade on a long pole), carefully cut away the leaves from the (the succulent core of the plant), which can average around in the valley and in the highlands. If harvested too late or too early, the will not have the right amount of carbohydrates for fermentation.

After harvesting, the are transported to ovens where they are slowly baked to break down their complex fructans into simple fructose. Then, the baked are either shredded or mashed under a large stone wheel called a . The pulp fiber, or , left behind is often reused as compost or animal feed, or can be used as fuel or processed into paper. Some producers like to add a small amount of back into their fermentation tanks for a stronger agave flavor in the final product.

The extracted agave juice is then poured into either large wooden or stainless steel vats for several days to ferment, resulting in a wort, or , with low alcohol content. This wort is then distilled once to produce what is called , and then a second time to produce clear &quot;silver&quot; tequila. A minimum of two distillations is required by law. A few producers such as Casa Noble (for their &quot;Crystal&quot; expression) and Corzo (for their expression) have experimented with distilling the product a third time, but this has not caught on as a trend, and some have said it removes too much of the agave flavor from the tequila. At this point the tequila is either bottled as silver tequila or it is pumped into wooden barrels to age, where it develops a mellower flavor and amber color.

The differences in taste between tequila made from valley and highland agave plants can be noticeable. Plants grown in the highlands often yield sweeter and fruitier-tasting tequila, while valley agaves give the tequila an earthier flavor.

==Fermentation==
Unlike other tequila production steps, fermentation is largely outside the control of human beings. Fermentation is the conversion of sugars and carbohydrates to alcohol through yeast under anaerobic conditions, meaning that oxygen is not present during the process. Fermentation is also carried out in a non-aseptic environment, which increases the bacterial activity of tequila. The participation of microorganisms from the environment (yeasts and bacteria) makes fermentation a spontaneous process that gives rise to many byproducts that contribute to the flavor and aroma of tequila.

During the fermentation process, inoculum is added to the batch to accelerate the rate of fermentation. When inoculum is added, fermentation can take approximately 20 hours to 3 days. If inoculum is not added, fermentation could take up to 7 days. The rate of fermentation is a key factor in the quality and flavor of tequila produced. Worts fermented slowly are best because the amount of organoleptic compounds produced is greater. The alcohol content at the end of fermentation is between 4-9%.

===Organoleptic compounds===

Organoleptic compounds enhance flavor and aroma. These include fusel oil, methanol, aldehydes, organic acids and esters. Production of isoamyl and isobutyl alcohols begins after the sugar level is lowered substantially and continues for several hours after the alcoholic fermentation ends. In contrast, ethanol production begins in the first hours of the fermentation and ends with logarithmic yeast growth. The alcohol content in tequila is affected by three factors: the amount of isoamyl alcohol and isobutanol in the yeast strain, the carbon:nitrogen ratio (the higher the ratio, the more alcohol produced), and the temperature of fermentation.

The higher the temperature, the greater concentration of isobutyl and isoamyl alcohols produced. Although if temperatures are too high, this can cause the yeast to become less effective. Similarly, if the temperature is too low, the process occurs too slowly. This can become a large issue in Central Mexico, most precisely the city of Tequila, Jalisco, where most tequila is processed. The temperature in the city of Tequila can reach 31 °C. For this reason, tequila producers often use large stainless steel tanks for fermentation.

===Yeast===
The specific yeasts and the environments in which they act determine the resultant organoleptic combinations. The role of yeast is, through many enzymatic processes, to turn sugars and carbohydrates into alcohol. There are two steps, first in aerobic conditions, yeast is doubled in colony size every four hours. This process goes on for 24–48 hours. Next, yeast turns acetaldehyde into ethyl alcohol, which is known as one of the organoleptic compounds produced in fermentation.

The two main categories of yeast used in tequila are commercial brewers yeast and yeast that comes from precultivated existing yeast that has been preserved. The use of either type of yeast can result in different end products of tequila. Traditional production uses so-called &quot;open fermentation&quot;, relying on yeasts from the surrounding environment. A 2023 article analyzes the diversity of yeasts found in these uncontrolled conditions.

== Chemistry ==

=== Alcohol content ===

Tequila must have between 35% and 55% alcohol content (70 and 110 U.S. proof). Tequila is a distilled beverage that is made from the fermentation of the sugars in the blue agave plant once it has been cooked, the main sugar being fructose. Through the fermentation process, many factors influence the higher-order alcohols present in tequila, which include molecules such as isobutyl alcohol and isoamyl alcohol, along with the ethanol. Factors include the strain of yeast, the age of the agave plant itself, temperature, and the ratio of carbon to nitrogen.

The yeast strain used and the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio have the biggest influence on the production of higher-order alcohols; this is not surprising, as production of ethanol and higher-order alcohols is an intrinsic property of the metabolism of each strain. The type of yeast most commonly found in tequila is &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, which can include many different strains. For example, &quot;CF1 agaves&quot;, a type of yeast, produces much more ethanol than a CF2 strain, as the two yeasts&#x27; metabolic mechanisms differ. Prevalence of certain strains of yeast may be influenced by agricultural practices. It was found that higher ratios of carbon to nitrogen resulted in greater production of higher-order alcohols such as isobutyl alcohol and isoamyl alcohol. The lower level of nitrogen in the fermentation process results in deamination reactions of amino acids, which in turn leads to the synthesis of higher alcohols. The Ehrlich pathway refers to this process in which alpha-keto acids are decarboxylated and transformed to aldehydes and to higher alcohols.

The temperature of the fermentation process also greatly affects the alcohol content of the resulting product. For example, a study conducted by Pinal &quot;et al.&quot; found that cultivating two strains at a temperature of 35 °C as compared to a temperature of 30 °C produced more isoamyl alcohol. The higher temperature appears to be favorable for the action of the yeast.

The age of the agave plant is also a factor: the older the plant, the greater the production of higher-order alcohols. It was shown in a study that the concentration of amyl alcohol increased by 30% as the plant aged. Conversely, a higher concentration of methanol is found when using younger plants. This change may be due to differences in agricultural practices with plants of different ages.

=== Color ===

Tequila&#x27;s color ranges from clear to a brownish amber, depending on the aging process and the type of wood used for storage. The white (blanco) version of tequila, also nicknamed &quot;silver&quot;, is the product with no aging, or may be aged less than two months. It is the purest form, as little has been done to change it. What is known as gold, joven or oro tequila is usually white tequila with the addition of grain alcohols and caramel color; some higher-end gold tequilas may be a blend of white and reposado. Rested (reposado) tequila is aged for a relatively short time (two months or more), and aged (añejo) tequila for a longer time (a year or more). All aging of tequila is done in wooden containers. The aging process can last three years or more, and can create or enhance flavors and aromas. It generally imparts a golden color.

=== Flavor and aroma ===

There are more than 300 known compounds in tequila, many of which are produced during the fermentation process, the raw material used, and to a lesser degree during the maturation. The components that make up tequila do not act individually to give tequila its distinctive flavor and aroma, but rather, depend on the interaction and quantity of each volatile compound. The volatile compounds responsible for the flavor and aroma profiles of the tequila are put into a category called organoleptic compounds and are known to increase in concentration with a slower fermentation process. The organoleptic compounds produced during fermentation include higher order alcohols, methanol, esters, carbonyls, terpenes, and furans.

Higher-order alcohols have a strong aroma, and the quantity present in each tequila depends on the carbon:nitrogen ratio and temperature during the cooking and fermentation processes. Some of the most common alcohols present other than ethanol are: isoamyl alcohol, isobutanol, and 1-propanol. Methanol is thought to be mainly generated through hydrolysis of methylated pectin, which is naturally present in the agave plant, but there has been speculation that it is also partly produced from the enzymatic reactions of yeast strains containing pectin methyl esterase enzyme, which break up the methoxyl group from the pectin. Nearly 50 different esters are identified in tequila, which together give rise to the fruit-like flavors and smell. One of the most abundant esters is ethyl acetate, which is synthesized during fermentation by the yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae,&quot; using alcohol transferase enzyme that links acetic acid to ethanol.

In general, the longer the controlled fermentation period, the higher yield of esters produced. During the fermentation process, ethanol is oxidized and one of the main compounds produced are acetaldehydes, which adds the flavor necessary for the final product of tequila. For example, isovaleraldehyde seems to produce a sweet, cocoa, and chocolate-like flavor. 2 and 3-methylbutanal produce a malty flavor. The agave plant contains many phenolics such as vanillin and syringaldehydes, which present a strong and fruity or herbal aroma. It also contains eugenol, which can deliver a hint of spicy flavor to the tequila. Because the production of tequila involves heating, Maillard browning reactions occur, and furans are produced during the thermal degradation of sugar. The most prominent furanic compounds include 2-furaldehyde and 5-methylfuraldehyde, which can contribute to the smoky flavor of tequila. Guaiacol also seems to contribute to Tequila&#x27;s smoky flavor. Beta-demascenone contributes to the woody, floral taste of tequila.

Volatile compounds that contribute to the overall taste and aroma of tequila can be quantitatively assessed and evaluated by gas chromatography. Discrimination tests such as duo-trio and triangle tests are also used to evaluate the quality of the tequila.

== Aging ==

=== Process ===

If silver or white (&quot;Blanco&quot;) tequila is the desired final product, distillation is the final process it undergoes. Rested (&quot;Reposado&quot;) or aged (&quot;Añejo&quot;) tequila must be matured in 200-liter (or larger) white oak barrels for at least two months for the former and 12 months for the latter. The newest category of tequila classification, extra añejo, must be aged for at least three years in oak barrels. There are, however, more than 50 different companies producing tequila in the Mexican province of Jalisco, with different maturation times according to the variety of tequila and desired quality of the final product.

All companies producing tequila have their aging processes regulated and fiscalized by the Mexican government.

=== Chemistry ===
The maturation process causes four main chemical transformations to the tequila compounds: (1) decreasing of fusel oils by the char in barrels, which acts as an absorbing agent; (2) extraction of complex wood constituents by tequila, giving specific aroma and flavor to the final product; (3) reactions among the components of tequila, creating new chemical compounds; and (4) oxidation of the original contents of tequila and of those extracted from wood. The final results of these changes are increased concentrations of acids, esters and aldehydes, and a decrease in fusel oil concentration.
Reposado may be rested in oak barrels or casks as large as 20,000 liters (5,280 gallons), allowing for richer and more complex flavors. The preferred oak comes from the US, France, or Canada, and is usually white oak. Some companies char the wood to impart a smoky flavor or use barrels previously used with different kinds of alcohol (e.g. whiskey or wine). Some &quot;reposados&quot; can also be aged in new wood barrels to achieve the same woody flavor and smoothness, but in less time.

&quot;Añejos&quot; are often rested in barrels previously used to rest &quot;reposados&quot;. The barrels cannot be more than 600 liters (158 gallons), and most are in the 200-liter (52-gallon) range. Many of the barrels used are from whiskey distilleries in the US or Canada, and Jack Daniels barrels are especially popular. This treatment creates many of the aspects of the dark color and more complex flavors of the&quot; añejo&quot; tequila. After aging of at least one year, the &quot;añejo&quot; can be removed from the wood barrels and placed in stainless steel tanks to reduce the amount of evaporation that can occur in the barrels.

===Threats to quality===
TMA (&quot;tristeza y muerte de agave&quot; – &quot;agave depression and death&quot;) is a blight that has reduced the production of the agave grown to produce tequila. This has resulted in lower production and higher prices throughout the early 21st century, and due to the long maturation of the plant, will likely continue to affect prices for years to come.

=== &quot;Tequila worm&quot; misconception ===

Only certain &quot;mezcals&quot;, usually from the state of Oaxaca, are ever sold &quot;con gusano&quot; (with worm). They are added as a marketing gimmick and are not traditional. The tequila regulatory council does not allow &quot;gusanos&quot; or scorpions (which are sometimes also added to mezcals) to be included in tequila bottles. The worm in some mezcals is actually the larval form of the moth &quot;Hypopta agavis&quot;, which lives on the agave plant. Finding one in the plant during processing indicates an infestation and, correspondingly, a lower-quality product. The misconception that tequilas may contain worms continues, despite effort and marketing to represent tequila as a premium liquor.

=== Norma Oficial Mexicana ===

The &quot;Norma Oficial Mexicana&quot; (NOM) applies to all processes and activities related to the supply of agave, production, bottling, marketing, information, and business practices linked to the distilled alcoholic beverage known as tequila. Tequila must be produced using agave of the species Tequilana Weber Blue variety, grown in the federal states and municipalities indicated in the Declaration.

Furthermore, the NOM establishes the technical specifications and legal requirements for the protection of the Appellation of Origin of &quot;Tequila&quot; in accordance with the current General Declaration of Protection of the Appellation of Origin of &quot;Tequila&quot;, the Law, the Industrial Property Law, the Federal Consumer Protection Law and other related legal provisions.

All authentic, regulated tequilas will have a NOM identifier on the bottle. The important laws since 1990 were NOM-006-SCFI-1993, the later updates NOM-006-SCFI-1994 and NOM-006-SCFI-2005 and the most recent revision published on December 13, 2012, NOM-006-SCFI-2012.

The number after NOM is the distillery number, assigned by the government. NOM does not indicate the location of the distillery, merely the parent company or, in the case where a company leases space in a plant, the physical plant where the tequila was manufactured.

== Storage condition ==
Unlike wine, whose character may change in taste over time and storage conditions, tequila does not change much once bottled, even without ideal storage conditions, much like most other distilled spirits such as whiskey, rum, or vodka. The quality characteristics (flavor, aroma, color, etc.) of a tequila are primarily determined during its aging in wood barrels. To maintain the utmost quality though, some conditions should be met: a constant and moderate temperature (60 to 65 °F), protection from direct sunlight, and maintenance of the integrity of the seal of the bottle. Improper storage conditions will have more effect on the taste of aged tequila rather than the un-aged version, due to tannins and other compounds introduced into the spirit from the aging barrel. For instance, if stored in improper conditions, the dark and more complex flavors of the añejo tequila are more likely to be tainted than the blanco or the silver tequila.

Once the bottle is opened, the tequila will be subject to oxidation that will continue to happen even if no more oxygen is introduced. In addition, if the bottle has more room for air, the process of oxidation occurs faster on the liquor remaining inside the bottle. Therefore, it may be the best to consume the tequila within one or two years after opening. For the most part, the change in quality of tequila is due to extreme conditions of improper storage, not due to oxidation.

==Types==

The two basic categories of tequila are&quot; mixtos&quot; and 100% agave. &quot;Mixtos&quot; use no less than 51% agave, with other sugars making up the remainder. &quot;Mixtos&quot; use both glucose and fructose sugars.

There are also four categories for tequila, depending on the aging period:
*&quot;Blanco&quot; (&quot;white&quot;) or &quot;plata&quot; (&quot;silver&quot;): white spirit, unaged and bottled or stored immediately after distillation, or aged less than two months in stainless steel or neutral oak barrels
*&quot;Reposado&quot; (&quot;rested&quot;): aged a minimum of two months, but less than a year in oak barrels of any size
*&quot;Añejo&quot; (&quot;aged&quot; or &quot;vintage&quot;): aged a minimum of one year, but less than three years in small oak barrels
*&quot;Extra Añejo&quot; (&quot;extra aged&quot; or &quot;ultra aged&quot;): aged a minimum of three years in oak barrels; this category was established in March 2006.
*&quot;Cristalino&quot; (&quot;crystalline&quot;): aged tequila that has been filtered to remove its color before bottling. This style existed as early as 2009, and is growing in popularity. This appeals to bartenders, who can make cocktails with aged tequila while not changing its color. Similar to chill filtering of whisky, critics say this also removes some flavor along with color, which has led many producers to use additives to restore some of what is lost. There are some brands making cristalino that claim to be additive-free.

== Brands ==

The &quot;Consejo Regulador del Tequila&quot; (Tequila Regulatory Council) reported 1377 registered brands from 150 producers for the year 2013.

== Serving ==

In Mexico, the most traditional way to drink tequila is neat, without lime and salt. It is popular in some regions to drink fine tequila with a side of sangrita—a sweet, sour, and spicy drink typically made from orange juice, grenadine (or tomato juice), and hot chilli. Equal-sized shots of tequila and sangrita are sipped alternately, without salt or lime. Another popular drink in Mexico is the &quot;bandera&quot; (flag, in Spanish), named after the Flag of Mexico, it consists of three shot glasses, filled with lime juice (for the green), white tequila, and sangrita (for the red).

Outside Mexico, a single shot of tequila is often served with salt and a slice of lime or lemon. This is called &quot;tequila cruda&quot; and is sometimes referred to as &quot;training wheels&quot;, &quot;lick-sip-suck&quot;, or &quot;lick-shoot-suck&quot; (referring to the way in which the combination of ingredients is imbibed). The drinkers moisten the back of their hands below the index finger (usually by licking) and pour on the salt. Then the salt is licked off the hand, the tequila is drunk, and the fruit slice is quickly bitten. Groups of drinkers often do this simultaneously. Drinking tequila in this way is often erroneously called a Tequila Slammer, which is in fact a mix of tequila and carbonated drink. Though the traditional Mexican shot is tequila by itself, lime is the fruit of choice when a chaser must be used. The salt is believed to lessen the &quot;burn&quot; of the tequila and the sour fruit balances and enhances the flavor. In Germany and some other countries, &quot;tequila oro&quot; (gold) is often consumed with cinnamon on a slice of orange after, while &quot;tequila blanco&quot; (white) is consumed with salt and lime.
If the bottle of tequila does not state on the label that it is manufactured from 100% blue agave (no sugars added), then, by default, that tequila is a &quot;mixto&quot; (manufactured from at least 51% blue agave). Some tequila distilleries label their tequila as &quot;made with blue agave&quot; or &quot;made from blue agave&quot;. The Tequila Regulatory Council has stated only tequilas distilled with 100% agave can be designated as &quot;100% agave&quot;.

Many of the higher-quality, 100% agave tequilas do not impart significant alcohol burn, and drinking them with salt and lime is likely to remove much of the flavor. These tequilas are usually sipped from a snifter glass rather than a shot glass, and savoured instead of quickly gulped. Doing so allows the taster to detect subtler fragrances and flavors that would otherwise be missed.

===Tequila glasses===
When served neat (without any additional ingredients), tequila is most often served in a narrow shot glass called a &quot;caballito&quot; (little horse, in Spanish), but can often be found in anything from a snifter to a tumbler.

The Consejo Regulador del Tequila approved an &quot;official tequila glass&quot; in 2002 called the Ouverture Tequila glass, made by Riedel.

The margarita glass, frequently rimmed with salt or sugar, is a staple for the entire genre of tequila-based mixed drinks, including the margarita.

===Cocktails===
A variety of cocktails are made with tequila, including the margarita, a cocktail that helped make tequila popular in the United States. The traditional margarita uses tequila, Cointreau, and lime juice, though many variations exist. A popular cocktail in Mexico is the &quot;Paloma&quot;. Also, a number of martini variants involve tequila, and a large number of tequila drinks are made by adding fruit juice. These include the Tequila Sunrise and the Matador. Sodas and other carbonated drinks are a common mixer, as in the Tequila Slammer. Other popular cocktails are the &quot;Acapulco cocktail&quot;, Chimayó Cocktail, Mexican martini, Mojito Blanco, Vampiro and Ranch Water.

== IP protection and regulation outside of Mexico ==

Mexican laws state that tequila can be produced only in the state of Jalisco and limited municipalities in the states of Guanajuato, Michoacán, Nayarit, and Tamaulipas. Tequila is recognized as a Mexican designation of origin product in more than 40 countries. It was protected through NAFTA in Canada and the United States until July 2020 and through bilateral agreements with individual countries such as Japan and Israel, and it has been a protected designation of origin product in the European Union since 1997.

The Mexican government took initiatives to protect tequila as early as the 1970s. Tequila became the country&#x27;s first appellation of origin (AO) in 1974, and in 1978 it was internationally registered for protection under the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration. The AO defines the area in which tequila can be produced, essentially the area home to the blue agave from which it is derived. Under the AO, selected municipalities within only five Mexican states can grow the agave and produce tequila. These municipalities were selected based on geographical factors (such as climate, altitude and soil characteristics) and human factors (the use of traditional techniques of producing tequila that have been passed on from generation to generation).

Further to the AO registration, the Mexican government holds all the rights over the use of the name tequila.

Along with the international protection, Mexico has also sought similar protection for tequila in other important countries and regions through a number of bilateral and multilateral agreements. Pursuant to Annex 313 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Canada and the United States recognize tequila and mezcal as products originating from Mexico and, consequently, do not permit the sale of any product as tequila and/or mezcal unless they have been lawfully prepared in Mexico.

The Mexican government enforces the tequila intellectual property through the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (IMPI). The use of the name tequila is authorized and administered only by IMPI. IMPI may prohibit any unauthorized use of the name that may create confusion for the consumers, or constitute an act of unfair competition.

Despite protection under the Lisbon Agreement and NAFTA, tequila still faced competition from some pseudo tequilas. During the mid-1990s, as much as 3.5 million liters of these liquors were sold annually in Europe. The European liquors were produced from sugars of agave-like plants and were illegally labeled as tequila. Following the NAFTA precedent, Mexico entered into a bilateral agreement with the European Union concerning the mutual recognition and protection of AO in the spirits sector. Under this agreement the EU recognizes tequila and mezcal as &quot;denominations of origin&quot;, although enforcement has still been quite lax in Europe.

Mexico&#x27;s tequila protection interests were prominent during the Chinese accession negotiations to the World Trade Organization. In accordance with WTO accession regulations, in order to gain considerations for WTO membership, China had to sign bilateral agreements with all existing members, including Mexico. Since China has a climatic condition suitable for blue agave plants, Mexico was worried about rival pseudo tequilas from China. The Mexican authorities took the opportunity of the bilateral negotiations with China to ensure that the latter accepted tequila as a geographically indicated product.

=== Canada ===
Under Canadian regulations (C.R.C., c.870, section B.02.90), any product labelled, advertised, or sold as Tequila must be manufactured in Mexico, as it would be for consumption in Mexico. Once imported to Canada for sale, it is legal for Tequila to be diluted with distilled or otherwise purified water to adjust it to the desired strength and then sold.

=== United States ===
Similar to the law of Canada, the U.S. law (27 CFR 5.22 (g)) says that tequila must be &quot;manufactured in Mexico in compliance with the laws of Mexico regulating the manufacture of Tequila for consumption in that country.&quot;

<doc id="39358" wikidata="Q213363" url="?curid=39358" title="Open set">
<text>In mathematics, an open set is a generalization of an open interval in the real line.

In a metric space (a set with a distance defined between every two points), an open set is a set that, with every point in it, contains all points of the metric space that are sufficiently near to (that is, all points whose distance to is less than some value depending on ).

More generally, an open set is a member of a given collection of subsets of a given set, a collection that has the property of containing every union of its members, every finite intersection of its members, the empty set, and the whole set itself. A set in which such a collection is given is called a topological space, and the collection is called a topology. These conditions are very loose, and allow enormous flexibility in the choice of open sets. For example, &quot;every&quot; subset can be open (the discrete topology), or &quot;no&quot; subset can be open except the space itself and the empty set (the indiscrete topology).

In practice, however, open sets are usually chosen to provide a notion of nearness that is similar to that of metric spaces, without having a notion of distance defined. In particular, a topology allows defining properties such as continuity, connectedness, and compactness, which were originally defined by means of a distance.

The most common case of a topology without any distance is given by manifolds, which are topological spaces that, &quot;near&quot; each point, resemble an open set of a Euclidean space, but on which no distance is defined in general. Less intuitive topologies are used in other branches of mathematics; for example, the Zariski topology, which is fundamental in algebraic geometry and scheme theory.

== Motivation ==
Intuitively, an open set provides a method to distinguish two points. For example, if about one of two points in a topological space, there exists an open set not containing the other (distinct) point, the two points are referred to as topologically distinguishable. In this manner, one may speak of whether two points, or more generally two subsets, of a topological space are &quot;near&quot; without concretely defining a distance. Therefore, topological spaces may be seen as a generalization of spaces equipped with a notion of distance, which are called metric spaces.

In the set of all real numbers, one has the natural Euclidean metric; that is, a function which measures the distance between two real numbers: . Therefore, given a real number &quot;x&quot;, one can speak of the set of all points close to that real number; that is, within &quot;ε&quot; of &quot;x&quot;. In essence, points within ε of &quot;x&quot; approximate &quot;x&quot; to an accuracy of degree &quot;ε&quot;. Note that &quot;ε&quot; &gt; 0 always but as &quot;ε&quot; becomes smaller and smaller, one obtains points that approximate &quot;x&quot; to a higher and higher degree of accuracy. For example, if &quot;x&quot; = 0 and &quot;ε&quot; = 1, the points within &quot;ε&quot; of &quot;x&quot; are precisely the points of the interval (−1, 1); that is, the set of all real numbers between −1 and 1. However, with &quot;ε&quot; = 0.5, the points within &quot;ε&quot; of &quot;x&quot; are precisely the points of (−0.5, 0.5). Clearly, these points approximate &quot;x&quot; to a greater degree of accuracy than when &quot;ε&quot; = 1.

The previous discussion shows, for the case &quot;x&quot; = 0, that one may approximate &quot;x&quot; to higher and higher degrees of accuracy by defining &quot;ε&quot; to be smaller and smaller. In particular, sets of the form (−&quot;ε&quot;, &quot;ε&quot;) give us a lot of information about points close to &quot;x&quot; = 0. Thus, rather than speaking of a concrete Euclidean metric, one may use sets to describe points close to &quot;x&quot;. This innovative idea has far-reaching consequences; in particular, by defining different collections of sets containing 0 (distinct from the sets (−&quot;ε&quot;, &quot;ε&quot;)), one may find different results regarding the distance between 0 and other real numbers. For example, if we were to define R as the only such set for &quot;measuring distance&quot;, all points are close to 0 since there is only one possible degree of accuracy one may achieve in approximating 0: being a member of R. Thus, we find that in some sense, every real number is distance 0 away from 0. It may help in this case to think of the measure as being a binary condition: all things in R are equally close to 0, while any item that is not in R is not close to 0.

In general, one refers to the family of sets containing 0, used to approximate 0, as a neighborhood basis; a member of this neighborhood basis is referred to as an open set. In fact, one may generalize these notions to an arbitrary set (&quot;X&quot;); rather than just the real numbers. In this case, given a point (&quot;x&quot;) of that set, one may define a collection of sets &quot;around&quot; (that is, containing) &quot;x&quot;, used to approximate &quot;x&quot;. Of course, this collection would have to satisfy certain properties (known as axioms) for otherwise we may not have a well-defined method to measure distance. For example, every point in &quot;X&quot; should approximate &quot;x&quot; to &quot;some&quot; degree of accuracy. Thus &quot;X&quot; should be in this family. Once we begin to define &quot;smaller&quot; sets containing &quot;x&quot;, we tend to approximate &quot;x&quot; to a greater degree of accuracy. Bearing this in mind, one may define the remaining axioms that the family of sets about &quot;x&quot; is required to satisfy.

== Definitions ==
Several definitions are given here, in an increasing order of technicality. Each one is a special case of the next one.

=== Euclidean space ===
A subset formula_1 of the Euclidean -space is &quot;open&quot; if, for every point in formula_1, there exists a positive real number (depending on ) such that any point in whose Euclidean distance from is smaller than belongs to formula_1. Equivalently, a subset formula_1 of is open if every point in formula_1 is the center of an open ball contained in formula_6

An example of a subset of that is not open is the closed interval , since neither nor belongs to for any , no matter how small.

=== Metric space ===
A subset &quot;U&quot; of a metric space is called &quot;open&quot; if, for any point &quot;x&quot; in &quot;U&quot;, there exists a real number &quot;ε&quot; &gt; 0 such that any point formula_7 satisfying belongs to &quot;U&quot;. Equivalently, &quot;U&quot; is open if every point in &quot;U&quot; has a neighborhood contained in &quot;U&quot;.

This generalizes the Euclidean space example, since Euclidean space with the Euclidean distance is a metric space.

=== Topological space ===
A &quot;topology&quot; formula_8 on a set is a set of subsets of with the properties below. Each member of formula_8 is called an &quot;open set&quot;.

*formula_10 and formula_11
*Any union of sets in formula_8 belong to formula_8: if formula_14 then formula_15
*Any finite intersection of sets in formula_8 belong to formula_8: if formula_18 then formula_19

 together with formula_8 is called a topological space.

Infinite intersections of open sets need not be open. For example, the intersection of all intervals of the form formula_21 where formula_22 is a positive integer, is the set formula_23 which is not open in the real line.

A metric space is a topological space, whose topology consists of the collection of all subsets that are unions of open balls. There are, however, topological spaces that are not metric spaces.

== Properties ==
The union of any number of open sets, or infinitely many open sets, is open. The intersection of a finite number of open sets is open.

A complement of an open set (relative to the space that the topology is defined on) is called a closed set. A set may be both open and closed (a clopen set). The empty set and the full space are examples of sets that are both open and closed.

A set can never been considered as open by itself. This notion is relative to a containing set and a specific topology on it.

Whether a set is open depends on the topology under consideration. Having opted for greater brevity over greater clarity, we refer to a set &quot;X&quot; endowed with a topology formula_8 as &quot;the topological space &quot;X&quot;&quot; rather than &quot;the topological space formula_25&quot;, despite the fact that all the topological data is contained in formula_26 If there are two topologies on the same set, a set &quot;U&quot; that is open in the first topology might fail to be open in the second topology. For example, if &quot;X&quot; is any topological space and &quot;Y&quot; is any subset of &quot;X&quot;, the set &quot;Y&quot; can be given its own topology (called the &#x27;subspace topology&#x27;) defined by &quot;a set &quot;U&quot; is open in the subspace topology on &quot;Y&quot; if and only if &quot;U&quot; is the intersection of &quot;Y&quot; with an open set from the original topology on &quot;X&quot;.&quot; This potentially introduces new open sets: if &quot;V&quot; is open in the original topology on &quot;X&quot;, but formula_27 isn&#x27;t open in the original topology on &quot;X&quot;, then formula_27 is open in the subspace topology on &quot;Y&quot;.

As a concrete example of this, if &quot;U&quot; is defined as the set of rational numbers in the interval formula_29 then &quot;U&quot; is an open subset of the rational numbers, but not of the real numbers. This is because when the surrounding space is the rational numbers, for every point &quot;x&quot; in &quot;U&quot;, there exists a positive number &quot;a&quot; such that all points within distance &quot;a&quot; of &quot;x&quot; are also in &quot;U&quot;. On the other hand, when the surrounding space is the reals, then for every point &quot;x&quot; in &quot;U&quot; there is positive &quot;a&quot; such that all points within distance &quot;a&quot; of &quot;x&quot; are in &quot;U&quot; (because &quot;U&quot; contains no non-rational numbers).

== Uses ==

Open sets have a fundamental importance in topology. The concept is required to define and make sense of topological space and other topological structures that deal with the notions of closeness and convergence for spaces such as metric spaces and uniform spaces.

Every subset &quot;A&quot; of a topological space &quot;X&quot; contains a (possibly empty) open set; the maximum (ordered under inclusion) such open set is called the interior of &quot;A&quot;. 
It can be constructed by taking the union of all the open sets contained in &quot;A&quot;.

A function formula_30 between two topological spaces formula_31 and formula_32 is if the preimage of every open set in formula_32 is open in formula_34
The function formula_30 is called if the image of every open set in formula_31 is open in formula_37

An open set on the real line has the characteristic property that it is a countable union of disjoint open intervals.

== Special types of open sets ==

=== Clopen sets and non-open and/or non-closed sets ===

A set might be open, closed, both, or neither. In particular, open and closed sets are not mutually exclusive, meaning that it is in general possible for a subset of a topological space to simultaneously be both an open subset a closed subset. Such subsets are known as . Explicitly, a subset formula_38 of a topological space formula_25 is called if both formula_38 and its complement formula_41 are open subsets of formula_25; or equivalently, if formula_43 and formula_44 

In topological space formula_45 the empty set formula_46 and the set formula_31 itself are always clopen. These two sets are the most well-known examples of clopen subsets and they show that clopen subsets exist in topological space. To see, it suffices to remark that, by definition of a topology, formula_31 and formula_46 are both open, and that they are also closed, since each is the complement of the other.

The open sets of the usual Euclidean topology of the real line formula_50 are the empty set, the open intervals and every union of open intervals.

* The interval formula_51 is open in formula_50 by definition of the Euclidean topology. It is not closed since its complement in formula_50 is formula_54 which is not open; indeed, an open interval contained in formula_55 cannot contain , and it follows that formula_55 cannot be a union of open intervals. Hence, formula_57 is an example of a set that is open but not closed.
* By a similar argument, the interval formula_58 is a closed subset but not an open subset.
* Finally, neither formula_59 nor its complement formula_60 are open (because they cannot be written as a union of open intervals); this means that formula_61 is neither open nor closed.

If a topological space formula_31 is endowed with the discrete topology (so that by definition, every subset of formula_31 is open) then every subset of formula_31 is a clopen subset. 
For a more advanced example reminiscent of the discrete topology, suppose that formula_65 is an ultrafilter on a non-empty set formula_34 Then the union formula_67 is a topology on formula_31 with the property that non-empty proper subset formula_38 of formula_31 is an open subset or else a closed subset, but never both; that is, if formula_71 (where formula_72) then of the following two statements is true: either (1) formula_43 or else, (2) formula_44 Said differently, subset is open or closed but the subsets that are both (i.e. that are clopen) are formula_46 and formula_34

=== Regular open sets ===

A subset formula_38 of a topological space formula_31 is called a &#x27; if formula_79 or equivalently, if formula_80, where formula_81, formula_82, and formula_83 denote, respectively, the topological boundary, interior, and closure of formula_38 in formula_31. A topological space for which there exists a base consisting of regular open sets is called a &#x27;. 
A subset of formula_31 is a regular open set if and only if its complement in formula_31 is a regular closed set, where by definition a subset formula_38 of formula_31 is called a if formula_90 or equivalently, if formula_91 
Every regular open set (resp. regular closed set) is an open subset (resp. is a closed subset) although in general, the converses are true.

== Generalizations of open sets ==
Throughout, formula_25 will be a topological space. 

A subset formula_93 of a topological space formula_31 is called:

Using the fact that 
:formula_95 and formula_96

whenever two subsets formula_97 satisfy formula_98 the following may be deduced:

* Every α-open subset is semi-open, semi-preopen, preopen, and b-open. 
* Every b-open set is semi-preopen (i.e. β-open). 
* Every preopen set is b-open and semi-preopen. 
* Every semi-open set is b-open and semi-preopen.

Moreover, a subset is a regular open set if and only if it is preopen and semi-closed. The intersection of an α-open set and a semi-preopen (resp. semi-open, preopen, b-open) set is a semi-preopen (resp. semi-open, preopen, b-open) set. Preopen sets need not be semi-open and semi-open sets need not be preopen. 

Arbitrary unions of preopen (resp. α-open, b-open, semi-preopen) sets are once again preopen (resp. α-open, b-open, semi-preopen). However, finite intersections of preopen sets need not be preopen. The set of all α-open subsets of a space formula_25 forms a topology on formula_31 that is finer than formula_26 

A topological space formula_31 is Hausdorff if and only if every compact subspace of formula_31 is θ-closed. 
A space formula_31 is totally disconnected if and only if every regular closed subset is preopen or equivalently, if every semi-open subset is preopen. Moreover, the space is totally disconnected if and only if the of every preopen subset is open.

<text>In set theory in mathematics and formal logic, two sets are said to be disjoint sets if they have no element in common. Equivalently, two disjoint sets are sets whose intersection is the empty set. For example, {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6} are &quot;disjoint sets,&quot; while {1, 2, 3} and {3, 4, 5} are not disjoint. A collection of two or more sets is called disjoint if any two distinct sets of the collection are disjoint.

==Generalizations==
This definition of disjoint sets can be extended to families of sets and to indexed families of sets. 
By definition, a collection of sets is called a &quot;family of sets&quot; (such as the power set, for example). In some sources this is a set of sets, while other sources allow it to be a multiset of sets, with some sets repeated.
An formula_1 is by definition a set-valued function (that is, it is a function that assigns a set formula_2 to every element formula_3 in its domain) whose domain formula_4 is called its (and elements of its domain are called ).

There are two subtly different definitions for when a family of sets formula_5 is called pairwise disjoint. According to one such definition, the family is disjoint if each two sets in the family are either identical or disjoint. This definition would allow pairwise disjoint families of sets to have repeated copies of the same set. According to an alternative definition, each two sets in the family must be disjoint; repeated copies are not allowed. The same two definitions can be applied to an indexed family of sets: according to the first definition, every two distinct indices in the family must name sets that are disjoint or identical, while according to the second, every two distinct indices must name disjoint sets. For example, the family of sets is disjoint according to both definitions, as is the family of the two parity classes of integers. However, the family formula_6 with 10 members has five repetitions each of two disjoint sets, so it is pairwise disjoint under the first definition but not under the second.

Two sets are said to be almost disjoint sets if their intersection is small in some sense. For instance, two infinite sets whose intersection is a finite set may be said to be almost disjoint.

In topology, there are various notions of separated sets with more strict conditions than disjointness. For instance, two sets may be considered to be separated when they have disjoint closures or disjoint neighborhoods. Similarly, in a metric space, positively separated sets are sets separated by a nonzero distance.

==Intersections==
Disjointness of two sets, or of a family of sets, may be expressed in terms of intersections of pairs of them.

Two sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are disjoint if and only if their intersection formula_7 is the empty set.
It follows from this definition that every set is disjoint from the empty set,
and that the empty set is the only set that is disjoint from itself.

If a collection contains at least two sets, the condition that the collection is disjoint implies that the intersection of the whole collection is empty. However, a collection of sets may have an empty intersection without being disjoint. Additionally, while a collection of less than two sets is trivially disjoint, as there are no pairs to compare, the intersection of a collection of one set is equal to that set, which may be non-empty. For instance, the three sets have an empty intersection but are not disjoint. In fact, there are no two disjoint sets in this collection. Also the empty family of sets is pairwise disjoint.

A Helly family is a system of sets within which the only subfamilies with empty intersections are the ones that are pairwise disjoint. For instance, the closed intervals of the real numbers form a Helly family: if a family of closed intervals has an empty intersection and is minimal (i.e. no subfamily of the family has an empty intersection), it must be pairwise disjoint.

==Disjoint unions and partitions==
A partition of a set &quot;X&quot; is any collection of mutually disjoint non-empty sets whose union is &quot;X&quot;. Every partition can equivalently be described by an equivalence relation, a binary relation that describes whether two elements belong to the same set in the partition.
Disjoint-set data structures and partition refinement are two techniques in computer science for efficiently maintaining partitions of a set subject to, respectively, union operations that merge two sets or refinement operations that split one set into two.

A disjoint union may mean one of two things. Most simply, it may mean the union of sets that are disjoint. But if two or more sets are not already disjoint, their disjoint union may be formed by modifying the sets to make them disjoint before forming the union of the modified sets. For instance two sets may be made disjoint by replacing each element by an ordered pair of the element and a binary value indicating whether it belongs to the first or second set.
For families of more than two sets, one may similarly replace each element by an ordered pair of the element and the index of the set that contains it.

<doc id="39360" wikidata="Q2356106" url="?curid=39360" title="Good-Bye to All That">
<text>Good-Bye to All That is an autobiography by Robert Graves which first appeared in 1929, when the author was 34 years old. &quot;It was my bitter leave-taking of England,&quot; he wrote in a prologue to the revised second edition of 1957, &quot;where I had recently broken a good many conventions&quot;. The title may also point to the passing of an old order following the cataclysm of the First World War; the supposed inadequacies of patriotism, the interest of some in atheism, feminism, socialism and pacifism, the changes to traditional married life, and not least the emergence of new styles of literary expression, are all treated in the work, bearing as they did directly on Graves&#x27;s life. The unsentimental and frequently comic treatment of the banalities and intensities of the life of a British army officer in the First World War gave Graves fame, notoriety and financial security, but the book&#x27;s subject is also his family history, childhood, schooling and, immediately following the war, early married life; all phases bearing witness to the &quot;particular mode of living and thinking&quot; that constitute a poetic sensibility.

Laura Riding, Graves&#x27;s lover, is credited with being a &quot;spiritual and intellectual midwife&quot; to the work. Graves, in a 1969 interview, claimed that he &quot;entirely rewrote&quot; the book—&quot;every single sentence&quot;—when it was reissued in the 1950s, suggesting that the process of co-writing &quot;The Reader Over Your Shoulder&quot; had made him more conscious of, and determined to rectify, deficiencies in his own style.

==Pre-war life==
Graves undertook climbing, stating &quot;the sport made all others seem trivial.&quot; His first climb was Crib y Ddysgl, followed by climbs on Crib Goch and Y Lliwedd.

Graves goes on to claim, &quot;In English preparatory and public schools romance is necessarily homosexual. The opposite sex is despised and treated as something obscene. Many boys never recover from this perversion. For every one born homosexual, at least ten permanent pseudo-homosexuals are made by the public school system: nine of these ten as honourably chaste and sentimental as I was.&quot;

==Wartime experiences==
A large part of the book is taken up by his experience of the First World War, in which Graves served as a lieutenant, then captain in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, with Siegfried Sassoon. &quot;Good-Bye to All That&quot; provides a detailed description of trench warfare, including the tragic incompetence of the Battle of Loos, including the use of gas, and the bitter fighting in the first phase of the Somme Offensive.

Graves claimed, &quot;At least one in three of my generation at school died; because they all took commissions as soon as they could, most of them in the infantry and Royal Flying Corps. The average life expectancy of an infantry subaltern on the Western Front was, at some stages of the War, only about three months; by which time he had been either wounded or killed.&quot;

Regarding trench conditions and Cuinchy-bred rats, Graves stated, &quot;They came up from the canal, fed on the plentiful corpses, and multiplied exceedingly.&quot;

===Wounds===
In the Somme engagement, Graves was wounded while leading his men through the cemetery at Bazentin-le-petit church on 20 July 1916. The wound initially appeared so severe that military authorities erroneously reported to his family that he had died. While mourning his death, Graves&#x27;s family received word from him that he was alive, and put an announcement to that effect in the newspapers. Graves later regretted omitting from the book the name of the soldier who had rescued him, Owen Roberts. The two met again fifty years later in a hospital ward to which both had been admitted for surgery, after which Graves signed Roberts&#x27;s copy of the book, giving Roberts full credit for saving his life.

===Reputed atrocities===

Graves also discussed atrocities committed during the war in &quot;Good-Bye to All That&quot;. He wrote that among his fellow troops, Allied atrocity propaganda, such as reports of the rape of Belgium, was widely disbelieved (defining &quot;atrocities&quot; in the book as wartime sexual violence, mutilation and torture instead of summary executions). Graves also noted that if &quot;the atrocity-list had to include the accidental-on-purpose bombing or machine-gunning of civilians from the air, the Allies were now committing as many atrocities as the Germans.&quot; Observing French and Belgian civilians showing British soldiers body parts allegedly mutilated by German troops, he argued that these were more likely the result of indiscriminate shelling.

Though the German use of serrated knives and British deployment of expanding bullets were regarded by the other side as &quot;atrocious&quot;, Graves claimed that the opportunity for soldiers on both sides to commit &quot;true atrocities&quot; only occurred when escorting prisoners of war to the rear lines. &quot;Nearly every instructor in the mess&quot;, he wrote, &quot;could quote specific instances of prisoners having been murdered on the way back. The commonest motives were, it seems, revenge for the death of friends or relatives, jealousy of the prisoner&#x27;s trip to a comfortable prison camp in England, military enthusiasm, fear of being suddenly overpowered by the prisoners or, more simply, impatience with the escorting job.&quot; Similarly, &quot;If a German patrol found a wounded man, they were likely as not to cut his throat.&quot; However, if POWs arrived at their destination, they were treated well during interrogations.

In the book, Graves stated that Australian and Canadian troops had the worst reputation for atrocities against German POWs. He recounted two first-hand anecdotes from a Scottish-Canadian and an Australian, who told him how they murdered German prisoners while escorting them using Mills bombs. Canadian soldiers were motivated to commit atrocities against POWs due to the story of &quot;The Crucified Soldier&quot;, which Graves and his fellow soldiers also refused to believe. He also added that the use of &quot;semi-civilized coloured troops in Europe was, from the German point of view, we knew, one of the chief Allied atrocities. We sympathized.&quot;

===Postwar trauma===
Graves was severely traumatised by his war experience. After being wounded in the lung by a shell blast, he endured a squalid five-day train journey with unchanged bandages. During initial military training in England, he received an electric shock from a telephone that had been hit by lightning, which caused him for the next twelve years to stammer and sweat badly if he had to use one. Upon his return home, he describes being haunted by ghosts and nightmares.

According to Graves, &quot;My particular disability was neurasthenia.&quot; He went on to say, &quot;Shells used to come bursting on my bed at midnight ... strangers in daytime would assume the faces of friends who had been killed.&quot; Offered a chance to rejoin George Mallory in climbing, Graves declined, &quot;I could never again now deliberately take chances with my life.&quot;

==Critical responses==
Siegfried Sassoon and his friend Edmund Blunden (whose First World War service had been in a different regiment) took umbrage at the contents of the book. Sassoon&#x27;s complaints mostly related to Graves&#x27;s depiction of him and his family, whereas Blunden had read the memoirs of J. C. Dunn and found them at odds with Graves in some places. The two men took Blunden&#x27;s copy of &quot;Good-Bye to All That&quot; and made marginal notes contradicting some of the text. That copy survives and is held by the New York Public Library. Graves&#x27;s father, Alfred Perceval Graves, also incensed at some aspects of Graves&#x27;s book, wrote a riposte to it titled &quot;To Return to All That.&quot;

It was included in Robert McCrum&#x27;s &quot;Guide to the 100 greatest nonfiction books in English&quot; published by The Guardian.

<doc id="39363" wikidata="Q61336" url="?curid=39363" title="Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg">
<text>Frederick (Middle High German: &quot;Friderich&quot;, Standard German: &quot;Friedrich&quot;; 21 September 1371 – 20 September 1440) was the last Burgrave of Nuremberg from 1397 to 1427 (as Frederick VI), Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach from 1398, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach from 1420, and Elector of Brandenburg (as Frederick I) from 1415 until his death. He became the first member of the House of Hohenzollern to rule the Margraviate of Brandenburg.

== Biography ==

Frederick was born in Nuremberg, the second-born son of Burgrave Frederick V (1333–1398) and the Wettin princess Elisabeth of Meissen. He entered early into the service of his brother-in-law, the Habsburg duke Albert III of Austria. After Albert&#x27;s death in 1395, he fought on the side of the Luxembourg king Sigismund of Hungary against invading Ottoman forces. He and his elder brother John, husband of Sigismund&#x27;s sister Margaret of Bohemia, fought in the 1396 Battle of Nicopolis where they suffered a disastrous defeat.

After Frederick returned to Nuremberg, he divided the Franconian inheritance from his father with his brother John, who received the Principality of Bayreuth, while Frederick kept the Principality of Ansbach; the brothers ruled jointly in the Burgraviate of Nuremberg. At first Frederick tried to mediate in the imperial confusion between Sigismund&#x27;s elder half-brother, the German king Wenceslaus, and the party of Elector Rupert III of the Palatinate, but from September 1399 he fought on the side of Rupert, husband of his sister Elizabeth, nonetheless. Wenceslaus was eventually deposed and Rupert elected King of the Romans on 21 August 1400.

Frederick resumed his rule of Ansbach in 1409 and after heavy feuding, entered into the service of King Sigismund. In 1410, the death of Rupert, King of the Germans, left the throne of the Holy Roman Empire vacant. Sigismund enlisted Frederick&#x27;s help in obtaining the throne. At the time, Jobst of Moravia ruled Brandenburg and thus was one of the prince-electors who had the right to vote for the new king. However, Sigismund disputed Jobst&#x27;s claim to Brandenburg and his right to vote in the imperial election. Sigismund claimed these rights for himself and designated Frederick to represent him as elector of Brandenburg in the imperial election of 20 September 1410. While Sigismund won this initial vote, Jobst of Moravia won the support of a majority of electors in an election in October 1410 and himself claimed the imperial throne. Jobst&#x27;s death under suspicious circumstances in January 1411 cleared the way for Sigismund&#x27;s recovery of Brandenburg and his undisputed election as king of the empire later that year. In gratitude for Frederick&#x27;s services, King Sigismund made him &quot;Oberster Hauptmann&quot; and &quot;Verwalter der Marken&quot; (1411). With an iron hand Frederick fought against the rebellious nobility of the March of Brandenburg (in particular, the Quitzow family) and, in the end, restored security. Frederick also became a member of the Parakeet Society and of the League of Constance.

At the Council of Constance (30 April 1415) Sigismund granted Frederick the titles of Margrave and Prince-elector of Brandenburg. On 21 October 1415 the Brandenburg states meeting in a &quot;Landtag&quot; asked him to rule in Berlin. The king awarded him the formal enfeoffment of the margravate on 18 April 1417. As Frederick did not agree with the forcible action of Sigismund against the Hussites, relations between them cooled.

Constant feuding with the nobility of Brandenburg led Frederick to withdraw to his castle at Cadolzburg in 1425 and transfer the regency of the mark to his son John in 1426 (Frederick, however, remained elector). After 1427 he organized the imperial war against the Hussites. He is best known for joining the papal legate Julian Cesarini in August 1431 to attack the Hussites in the disastrous Battle of Domažlice. He subsequently provided substantial assistance in the mediation of the Compacta of Prague at the Council of Basel (30 November 1433).

Upon his death in 1440, Frederick was succeeded as elector by his second-eldest son, Frederick II.

== Family and children ==

<text>Frederick II of Brandenburg () (19 November 1413 – 10 February 1471), nicknamed &quot;the Iron&quot; (&quot;der Eiserne&quot;) and sometimes &quot;Irontooth&quot; (&quot;Eisenzahn&quot;), was a Prince-elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg from 1440 until his abdication in 1470, and was a member of the House of Hohenzollern.
==Biography==
Frederick II was born at Tangermünde Castle (German: &quot;Burg Tangermünde&quot;), when Tangermünde was within the Margraviate of Brandenburg, to Frederick I, Brandenburg&#x27;s first Hohenzollern ruler, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Frederick, Duke of Bavaria-Landshut, and Maddalena Visconti. The latter was a daughter of Bernabò Visconti and Beatrice della Scala. As the second son, his brothers included John the Alchemist and Albert Achilles, both of whom also ruled Brandenburg as margraves.

In 1421, at age 8, Frederick was betrothed to Hedwig Jagiellon, but she died on 8 December 1431, before the marriage could take place.

When Frederick I retired in 1437, he compensated his incapable eldest son John with the Principality of Bayreuth while Frederick II assumed the government of Brandenburg. Unlike his father, he turned away from imperial politics and concentrated on his efforts to pacify the nobility and towns of the electorate. Quarrels with the city of Berlin began in 1440 with his plans to build a new residence on the Cölln island of the Spree river. In 1448 the &quot;Berliner Unwille&quot; (indignation) against the cession of the city&#x27;s territory for an electoral stronghold culminated in open revolt, when the citizens flooded the excavation of the future &quot;Stadtschloss&quot;. Nevertheless, Frederick II prevailed, had the palace built and the city&#x27;s rights decisively curtailed.

In 1453, Frederick II, in his position as the Margrave of Brandenburg, was sent a letter from Rhodes, penned by the Grand Master of the Knights of St John, notifying him of the Fall of Constantinople and requesting he send them support so as to allow them to continue to combat the Turkish threat. His response is unknown.

In 1454 and 1455, he concluded the Treaties of Cölln and Mewe and thereby re-gained the Neumark (New March) from the Teutonic Order state. Weary of the long struggle with the Duchy of Pomerania, he abdicated in 1470 in favour of his younger brother Albert Achilles, he retired to the Bayreuth Principality and died one year later in Neustadt an der Aisch.

==Family and children==

On 11 June 1441, Frederick II married Catherine of Saxony (1421 – August 23, 1476), a daughter of Elector Frederick I of Saxony and Katharina of Brunswick-Lüneburg. They had three children (and Frederick had one bastard):

*Dorothea of Brandenburg (c. 1446 – March, 1519), married Duke John V of Saxe-Lauenburg on 12 February 1464.
*Margaret of Brandenburg (c. 1450 – 1489), married Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania.
*Johan of Brandenburg (December 23, 14{06-16} - 1454)
*Erasmus von Brandenburg (c. 1452 - 1465).

<text>In mathematics, a prototile is one of the shapes of a tile in a tessellation.

==Definition==
A tessellation of the plane or of any other space is a cover of the space by closed shapes, called tiles, that have disjoint interiors. Some of the tiles may be congruent to one or more others. If is the set of tiles in a tessellation, a set of shapes is called a set of prototiles if no two shapes in are congruent to each other, and every tile in is congruent to one of the shapes in .

It is possible to choose many different sets of prototiles for a tiling: translating or rotating any one of the prototiles produces another valid set of prototiles. However, every set of prototiles has the same cardinality, so the number of prototiles is well defined. A tessellation is said to be &quot;monohedral&quot; if it has exactly one prototile.

==Aperiodicity==

A set of prototiles is said to be aperiodic if every tiling with those prototiles is an aperiodic tiling. In March 2023, four researchers, Chaim Goodman-Strauss, David Smith, Joseph Samuel Myers and Craig S. Kaplan, announced the discovery of an aperiodic monohedral prototile (monotile) and a proof that the tile discovered by David Smith is an aperiodic monotile, i.e. a solution to a longstanding open einstein problem.

In higher dimensions, the problem had been solved earlier: the Schmitt-Conway-Danzer tile is the prototile of a monohedral aperiodic tiling of three-dimensional Euclidean space, and cannot tile space periodically.

<doc id="39374" wikidata="Q49957" url="?curid=39374" title="Large Magellanic Cloud">
<text>The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is a dwarf galaxy and satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. At a distance of around , the LMC is the second- or third-closest galaxy to the Milky Way, after the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal ( away) and the possible dwarf irregular galaxy called the Canis Major Overdensity. Based on the D25 isophote at the B-band (445 nm wavelength of light), the Large Magellanic Cloud is about across. It is roughly one-hundredth the mass of the Milky Way and is the fourth-largest galaxy in the Local Group, after the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), the Milky Way, and the Triangulum Galaxy (M33).

The LMC is classified as a Magellanic spiral. It contains a stellar bar that is geometrically off-center, suggesting that it was once a barred dwarf spiral galaxy before its spiral arms were disrupted, likely by tidal interactions from the nearby Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and the Milky Way&#x27;s gravity. The LMC is predicted to merge with the Milky Way in approximately 2.4 billion years.

With a declination of about −70°, the LMC is visible as a faint &quot;cloud&quot; from the southern hemisphere of the Earth and from as far north as 20° N. It straddles the constellations Dorado and Mensa and has an apparent length of about 10° to the naked eye, 20 times the Moon&#x27;s diameter, from dark sites away from light pollution.

==History of observation==

Both the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds have been easily visible for southern nighttime observers well back into prehistory. It has been claimed that the first known written mention of the Large Magellanic Cloud was by the Persian astronomer &#x27;Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi Shirazi (later known in Europe as &quot;Azophi&quot;), which he referred to as &quot;Al Bakr&quot;, the White Ox, in his &quot;Book of Fixed Stars&quot; around 964 AD. However, this seems to be a misunderstanding of a reference to some stars south of Canopus which he admits he had not seen.

The first confirmed recorded observation was in 1503–1504 by Amerigo Vespucci in a letter about his third voyage. He mentioned &quot;three Canopes, two bright and one obscure&quot;; &quot;bright&quot; refers to the two Magellanic Clouds, and &quot;obscure&quot; refers to the Coalsack.
Ferdinand Magellan sighted the LMC on his voyage in 1519 and his writings brought it into common Western knowledge. The galaxy now bears his name.
The galaxy and southern end of Dorado are in the current epoch at opposition on about 5 December when thus visible from sunset to sunrise from equatorial points such as Ecuador, the Congos, Uganda, Kenya and Indonesia and for part of the night in nearby months. Above about 28° south, such as most of Australia and South Africa, the galaxy is always sufficiently above the horizon to be considered properly circumpolar, thus during spring and autumn the cloud is also visible much of the night, and the height of winter in June nearly coincides with closest proximity to the Sun&#x27;s apparent position.

Measurements with the Hubble Space Telescope, announced in 2006, suggest the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds may be moving too quickly to be orbiting the Milky Way.

Astronomers discovered a new black hole inside the Large Magellanic Cloud in November 2021 using the European Southern Observatory&#x27;s Very Large Telescope in Chile. Astronomers claim its gravity is influenced by a nearby star, which is about five times the mass of the Sun.

==Geometry==
The Large Magellanic Cloud has a prominent central bar and spiral arm. The central bar, with a radius of 6,900 light-years (2.13 kpc) and a position angle of about 121°, seems to be warped so that the east and west ends are nearer the Milky Way than the middle. In 2014, measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope made it possible to determine a rotation period of 250 million years.

The LMC was long considered to be a planar galaxy that could be assumed to lie at a single distance from the Solar System. However, in 1986, Caldwell and Coulson found that field Cepheid variables in the northeast lie closer to the Milky Way than those in the southwest. From 2001 to 2002 this inclined geometry was confirmed by the same means, by core helium-burning red clump stars, and by the tip of the red giant branch. All three papers find an inclination of 35°, where a face-on galaxy has an inclination of 0°. Further work on the structure of the LMC using the kinematics of carbon stars showed that the LMC&#x27;s disk is both thick and flared, likely due to interactions with the SMC. Regarding the distribution of star clusters in the LMC, Schommer et al. measured velocities for 80 clusters and found that the LMC&#x27;s cluster system has kinematics consistent with the clusters moving in a disk-like distribution. These results were confirmed by Grocholski et al., who calculated distances to a sample of clusters and showed that the cluster system is distributed in the same plane as the field stars.

==Distance==

Distance to the LMC has been calculated using standard candles; Cepheid variables are one of the most popular. These have been shown to have a relationship between their absolute luminosity and the period over which their brightness varies. However the variable of metallicity may also need to be taken as a component of this as consensus is this likely affects their period-luminosity relations. Unfortunately, those in the Milky Way typically used to calibrate the relation are more metal-rich than those found in the LMC.

Modern 8-meter-class optical telescopes have discovered eclipsing binaries throughout the Local Group. Parameters of these systems can be measured without mass or compositional assumptions. The light echoes of supernova 1987A are also geometric measurements, without any stellar models or assumptions.

In 2006, the Cepheid absolute luminosity was re-calibrated using Cepheid variables in the galaxy Messier 106 that cover a range of metallicities. Using this improved calibration, they find an absolute distance modulus of formula_1, or . This distance has been confirmed by other authors.

By cross-correlating different measurement methods, one can bound the distance; the residual errors are now less than the estimated size parameters of the LMC.

The results of a study using late-type eclipsing binaries to determine the distance more accurately was published in the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; in March 2013. A distance of with an accuracy of 2.2% was obtained.

==Features==
Like many irregular galaxies, the LMC is rich in gas and dust, and is currently undergoing vigorous star formation activity. It holds the Tarantula Nebula, the most active star-forming region in the Local Group.

The LMC has a wide range of galactic objects and phenomena that make it known as an &quot;astronomical treasure-house, a great celestial laboratory for the study of the growth and evolution of the stars&quot;, per Robert Burnham Jr. Surveys of the galaxy have found roughly 60 globular clusters, 400 planetary nebulae and 700 open clusters, along with hundreds of thousands of giant and supergiant stars. Supernova 1987A—the nearest supernova in recent years—was in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The Lionel-Murphy SNR (N86) nitrogen-abundant supernova remnant was named by astronomers at the Australian National University&#x27;s Mount Stromlo Observatory, acknowledging Australian High Court Justice Lionel Murphy&#x27;s interest in science and its perceived resemblance to his large nose.
A bridge of gas connects the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with the LMC, which evinces tidal interaction between the galaxies. The Magellanic Clouds have a common envelope of neutral hydrogen, indicating that they have been gravitationally bound for a long time. This bridge of gas is a star-forming site.

The Large Magellanic Cloud has a supermassive black hole at its center, estimated to have times the mass of the Sun. 21 hypervelocity stars have been discovered within the Milky Way&#x27;s halo, which are thought to have been ejected from the Large Magellanic Cloud after gravitational interaction with this black hole via the Hills mechanism.

==X-ray sources==

No X-rays above background were detected from either cloud during the September 20, 1966, Nike-Tomahawk rocket flight nor that of two days later. The second took off from Johnston Atoll at 17:13 UTC and reached an apogee of , with spin-stabilization at 5.6 rps. The LMC was not detected in the X-ray range 8–80 keV.

Another was launched from same atoll at 11:32 UTC on October 29, 1968, to scan the LMC for X-rays. The first discrete X-ray source in Dorado was at RA Dec , and it was the Large Magellanic Cloud. This X-ray source extended over about 12° and is consistent with the Cloud. Its emission rate between 1.5–10.5 keV for a distance of 50 kpc is /s. An X-ray astronomy instrument was carried aboard a Thor missile launched from the same atoll on September 24, 1970, at 12:54 UTC and altitudes above , to search for the Small Magellanic Cloud and to extend observation of the LMC. The source in the LMC appeared extended and contained star ε Dor. The X-ray luminosity (Lx) over the range 1.5–12 keV was ().

The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) appears in the constellations Mensa and Dorado. LMC X-1 (the first X-ray source in the LMC) is at RA Dec , and is a high-mass X-ray binary (star system) source (HMXB). Of the first five luminous LMC X-ray binaries: LMC X-1, X-2, X-3, X-4 and A 0538–66 (detected by Ariel 5 at A 0538–66), LMC X-2 is the one that is a bright low-mass X-ray binary system (LMXB) in the LMC.

DEM L316 in the Cloud consists of two supernova remnants. Chandra X-ray spectra show that the hot gas shell on the upper left has an abundance of iron. This implies that the upper-left SNR is the product of a Type Ia supernova; much lower such abundance in the lower remnant belies a Type II supernova.

A 16 ms X-ray pulsar is associated with SNR 0538-69.1. SNR 0540-697 was resolved using ROSAT.

<text>A space suit (or spacesuit) is an environmental suit used for protection from the harsh environment of outer space, mainly from its vacuum as a highly specialized pressure suit, but also its temperature extremes, as well as radiation and micrometeoroids. Basic space suits are worn as a safety precaution inside spacecrafts in case of loss of cabin pressure. For extravehicular activity (EVA) more complex space suits are worn, featuring a portable life support system.

Pressure suits are in general needed at low pressure environments above the Armstrong limit, at around above Earth. Space suits augment pressure suits with complex system of equipment and environmental systems designed to keep the wearer comfortable, and to minimize the effort required to bend the limbs, resisting a soft pressure garment&#x27;s natural tendency to stiffen against the vacuum. A self-contained oxygen supply and environmental control system is frequently employed to allow complete freedom of movement, independent of the spacecraft.

Three types of space suits exist for different purposes: IVA (intravehicular activity), EVA (extravehicular activity), and IEVA (intra/extravehicular activity). IVA suits are meant to be worn inside a pressurized spacecraft, and are therefore lighter and more comfortable. IEVA suits are meant for use inside and outside the spacecraft, such as the Gemini G4C suit. They include more protection from the harsh conditions of space, such as protection from micrometeoroids and extreme temperature change. EVA suits, such as the EMU, are used outside spacecraft, for either planetary exploration or spacewalks. They must protect the wearer against all conditions of space, as well as provide mobility and functionality.

The first full-pressure suits for use at extreme altitudes were designed by individual inventors as early as the 1930s. The first space suit worn by a human in space was the Soviet SK-1 suit worn by Yuri Gagarin in 1961. Since then space suits have been worn beside in Earth orbit, en-route and on the surface of the Moon.

== Requirements ==
A space suit must perform several functions to allow its occupant to work safely and comfortably, inside or outside a spacecraft. It must provide:
* A stable internal pressure. This can be less than Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, as there is usually no need for the space suit to carry nitrogen (which comprises about 78% of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and is not used by the body). Lower pressure allows for greater mobility, but requires the suit occupant to breathe pure oxygen for a time before going into this lower pressure, to avoid decompression sickness.
* Mobility. Movement is typically opposed by the pressure of the suit; mobility is achieved by careful joint design. See the &quot;Design concepts&quot; section.
* Supply of breathable oxygen and elimination of carbon dioxide; these gases are exchanged with the spacecraft or a Portable Life Support System (PLSS)
* Temperature regulation. Unlike on Earth, where heat can be transferred by convection to the atmosphere, in space, heat can be lost only by thermal radiation or by conduction to objects in physical contact with the exterior of the suit. Since the temperature on the outside of the suit varies greatly between sunlight and shadow, the suit is heavily insulated, and air temperature is maintained at a comfortable level.
* A communication system, with external electrical connection to the spacecraft or PLSS
* Means of collecting and containing solid and liquid bodily waste (such as a Maximum Absorbency Garment)

=== Secondary requirements ===

Advanced suits better regulate the astronaut&#x27;s temperature with a Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment (LCVG) in contact with the astronaut&#x27;s skin, from which the heat is dumped into space through an external radiator in the PLSS.

Additional requirements for EVA include:
* Shielding against ultraviolet radiation
* Limited shielding against particle radiation
* Means to maneuver, dock, release, and tether onto a spacecraft
* Protection against small micrometeoroids, some traveling at up to 27,000 kilometers per hour, provided by a puncture-resistant Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment, which is the outermost layer of the suit. Experience has shown the greatest chance of exposure occurs near the gravitational field of a moon or planet, so these were first employed on the Apollo lunar EVA suits (see &quot;United States suit models&quot; below).

As part of astronautical hygiene control (i.e., protecting astronauts from extremes of temperature, radiation, etc.), a space suit is essential for extravehicular activity. The Apollo/Skylab A7L suit included eleven layers in all: an inner liner, a LCVG, a pressure bladder, a restraint layer, another liner, and a Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment consisting of five aluminized insulation layers and an external layer of white Ortho-Fabric. This space suit is capable of protecting the astronaut from temperatures ranging from to .

During exploration of the Moon or Mars, there will be the potential for lunar or Martian dust to be retained on the space suit. When the space suit is removed on return to the spacecraft, there will be the potential for the dust to contaminate surfaces and increase the risks of inhalation and skin exposure. Astronautical hygienists are testing materials with reduced dust retention times and the potential to control the dust exposure risks during planetary exploration. Novel ingress and egress approaches, such as suitports, are being explored as well.

In NASA space suits, communications are provided via a cap worn over the head, which includes earphones and a microphone. Due to the coloration of the version used for Apollo and Skylab, which resembled the coloration of the comic strip character Snoopy, these caps became known as &quot;Snoopy caps&quot;.

=== Operating pressure ===

Generally, to supply enough oxygen for respiration, a space suit using pure oxygen must have a pressure of about , equal to the partial pressure of oxygen in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere at sea level, plus and water vapor pressure, both of which must be subtracted from the alveolar pressure to get alveolar oxygen partial pressure in 100% oxygen atmospheres, by the alveolar gas equation. The latter two figures add to , which is why many modern space suits do not use , but (this is a slight overcorrection, as alveolar partial pressures at sea level are slightly less than the former). In space suits that use 20.7 kPa, the astronaut gets only 20.7 kPa − 11.6 kPa = of oxygen, which is about the alveolar oxygen partial pressure attained at an altitude of above sea level. This is about 42% of normal partial pressure of oxygen at sea level, about the same as pressure in a commercial passenger jet aircraft, and is the realistic lower limit for safe ordinary space suit pressurization which allows reasonable capacity for work.

====Oxygen prebreathing====

When space suits below a specific operating pressure are used from craft that are pressurized to normal atmospheric pressure (such as the Space Shuttle), this requires astronauts to &quot;pre-breathe&quot; (meaning pre-breathe pure oxygen for a period) before donning their suits and depressurizing in the air lock. This procedure purges the body of dissolved nitrogen, so as to avoid decompression sickness due to rapid depressurization from a nitrogen-containing atmosphere.

In the US space shuttle, cabin pressure was reduced from normal atmospheric to 70kPa (equivalent to an altitude of about 3000m) for 24 hours before EVA, and after donning the suit, a pre-breathing period of 45 minutes on pure oxygen before decompressing to the EMU working pressure of 30kPa. In the ISS there is no cabin pressure reduction, instead a 4-hour oxygen pre-breathe at normal cabin pressure is used to desaturate nitrogen to an acceptable level. US studies show that a rapid decompression from 101kPa to 55kPa has an acceptable risk, and Russian studies show that direct decompression from 101kPa to 40kPa after 30 minutes of oxygen pre-breathing, roughly the time required for pre-EVA suit checks, is acceptable.

===Physiological effects of unprotected space exposure===

The human body can briefly survive the hard vacuum of space unprotected, despite contrary depictions in some popular science fiction. Consciousness is retained for up to 15 seconds as the effects of oxygen starvation set in. No snap freeze effect occurs because all heat must be lost through thermal radiation or the evaporation of liquids, and the blood does not boil because it remains pressurized within the body, but human flesh expands up to about twice its volume due to ebullism in such conditions, giving the visual effect of a body builder rather than an overfilled balloon.

In space, there are highly energized subatomic particles that can cause radiation damage by disrupting essential biological processes. Exposure to radiation can create problems via two methods: the particles can react with water in the human body to produce free radicals that break DNA molecules apart, or by directly breaking the DNA molecules.

Temperature in space can vary extremely depending on the exposure to radiant energy sources. Temperatures from solar radiation can reach up to , and in its absence, down to . Because of this, space suits must provide sufficient insulation and cooling for the conditions in which they will be used.

The vacuum environment of space has no pressure, so gases will expand and exposed liquids may evaporate. Some solids may sublimate. It is necessary to wear a suit that provides sufficient internal body pressure in space. The most immediate hazard is in attempting to hold one&#x27;s breath during explosive decompression as the expansion of gas can damage the lungs by overexpansion rupture. These effects have been confirmed through various accidents (including in very-high-altitude conditions, outer space and training vacuum chambers). Human skin does not need to be protected from vacuum and is gas-tight by itself. It only needs to be mechanically restrained to retain its normal shape and the internal tissues to retain their volume. This can be accomplished with a tight-fitting elastic body suit and a helmet for containing breathing gases, known as a space activity suit (SAS).

== Design concepts ==
A space suit should allow its user natural unencumbered movement. Nearly all designs try to maintain a constant volume no matter what movements the wearer makes. This is because mechanical work is needed to change the volume of a constant pressure system. If flexing a joint reduces the volume of the space suit, then the astronaut must do extra work every time they bend that joint, and they have to maintain a force to keep the joint bent. Even if this force is very small, it can be seriously fatiguing to constantly fight against one&#x27;s suit. It also makes delicate movements very difficult. The work required to bend a joint is dictated by the formula

:formula_1

where &quot;Vi&quot; and &quot;Vf&quot; are respectively the initial and final volume of the joint, &quot;P&quot; is the pressure in the suit, and &quot;W&quot; is the resultant work. It is generally true that all suits are more mobile at lower pressures. However, because a minimum internal pressure is dictated by life support requirements, the only means of further reducing work is to minimize the change in volume.

All space suit designs try to minimize or eliminate this problem. The most common solution is to form the suit out of multiple layers. The bladder layer is a rubbery, airtight layer much like a balloon. The restraint layer goes outside the bladder, and provides a specific shape for the suit. Since the bladder layer is larger than the restraint layer, the restraint takes all of the stresses caused by the pressure inside the suit. Since the bladder is not under pressure, it will not &quot;pop&quot; like a balloon, even if punctured. The restraint layer is shaped in such a way that bending a joint causes pockets of fabric, called &quot;gores&quot;, to open up on the outside of the joint, while folds called &quot;convolutes&quot; fold up on the inside of the joint. The gores make up for the volume lost on the inside of the joint, and keep the suit at a nearly constant volume. However, once the gores are opened all the way, the joint cannot be bent any further without a considerable amount of work.

In some Russian space suits, strips of cloth were wrapped tightly around the cosmonaut&#x27;s arms and legs outside the space suit to stop the space suit from ballooning when in space.

The outermost layer of a space suit, the Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment, provides thermal insulation, protection from micrometeoroids, and shielding from harmful solar radiation.

There are four main conceptual approaches to suit design:
===Soft suits===
Soft suits typically are made mostly of fabrics. All soft suits have some hard parts; some even have hard joint bearings. Intra-vehicular activity and early EVA suits were soft suits.

===Hard-shell suits===
Hard-shell suits are usually made of metal or composite materials and do not use fabric for joints. Hard suits joints use ball bearings and wedge-ring segments similar to an adjustable elbow of a stove pipe to allow a wide range of movement with the arms and legs. The joints maintain a constant volume of air internally and do not have any counter-force. Therefore, the astronaut does not need to exert to hold the suit in any position. Hard suits can also operate at higher pressures which would eliminate the need for an astronaut to pre-breathe oxygen to use a space suit before an EVA from a spacecraft cabin. The joints may get into a restricted or locked position requiring the astronaut to manipulate or program the joint. The NASA Ames Research Center experimental AX-5 hard-shell space suit had a flexibility rating of 95%. The wearer could move into 95% of the positions they could without the suit on.

===Hybrid suits===
Hybrid suits have hard-shell parts and fabric parts. NASA&#x27;s Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) uses a fiberglass Hard Upper Torso (HUT) and fabric limbs. ILC Dover&#x27;s I-Suit replaces the HUT with a fabric soft upper torso to save weight, restricting the use of hard components to the joint bearings, helmet, waist seal, and rear entry hatch. Virtually all workable space suit designs incorporate hard components, particularly at interfaces such as the waist seal, bearings, and in the case of rear-entry suits, the back hatch, where all-soft alternatives are not viable.

===Skintight suits===

Skintight suits, also known as mechanical counterpressure suits or space activity suits, are a proposed design which would use a heavy elastic body stocking to compress the body. The head is in a pressurized helmet, but the rest of the body is pressurized only by the elastic effect of the suit. This mitigates the constant volume problem, reduces the possibility of a space suit depressurization and gives a very lightweight suit. When not worn, the elastic garments may appear to be that of clothing for a small child. These suits may be very difficult to put on and face problems with providing a uniform pressure. Most proposals use the body&#x27;s natural perspiration to keep cool. Sweat evaporates readily in vacuum and may desublime or deposit on objects nearby: optics, sensors, the astronaut&#x27;s visor, and other surfaces. The icy film and sweat residue may contaminate sensitive surfaces and affect optical performance.

== Contributing technologies ==

Related preceding technologies include the stratonautical space suit, the gas mask used in World War II, the oxygen mask used by pilots of high-flying bombers in World War II, the high-altitude or vacuum suit required by pilots of the Lockheed U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird, the diving suit, rebreather, scuba diving gear, and many others.

Many space suit designs are taken from the U.S. Air Force suits, which are designed to work in &quot;high-altitude aircraft pressure[s]&quot;, such as the Mercury IVA suit or the Gemini G4C, or the Advanced Crew Escape Suits.

===Glove technology===

The Mercury IVA, the first U.S. space suit design, included lights at the tips of the gloves in order to provide visual aid. As the need for extravehicular activity grew, suits such as the Apollo A7L included gloves made of a metal fabric called Chromel-r in order to prevent punctures. In order to retain a better sense of touch for the astronauts, the fingertips of the gloves were made of silicone. With the shuttle program, it became necessary to be able to operate spacecraft modules, so the ACES suits featured gripping on the gloves. EMU gloves, which are used for spacewalks, are heated to keep the astronaut&#x27;s hands warm. The Phase VI gloves, meant for use with the Mark III suit, are the first gloves to be designed with &quot;laser scanning technology, 3D computer modeling, stereo lithography, laser cutting technology and CNC machining&quot;. This allows for cheaper, more accurate production, as well as increased detail in joint mobility and flexibility.

===Life support technology===

Prior to the Apollo missions, life support in space suits was connected to the space capsule via an umbilical cable. However, with the Apollo missions, life support was configured into a removable capsule called the Portable Life Support System that allowed the astronaut to explore the Moon without having to be attached to the space craft. The EMU space suit, used for spacewalks, allows the astronaut to manually control the internal environment of the suit. The Mark III suit has a backpack containing about 12 pounds of liquid air for breathing, pressurization, and heat exchange.

===Helmet technology===

The development of the spheroidal dome helmet was key in balancing the need for field of view, pressure compensation, and low weight. One inconvenience with some space suits is the head being fixed facing forwards and being unable to turn to look sideways. Astronauts call this effect &quot;alligator head&quot;.

===High-altitude suits===

* Evgeniy Chertovsky created his full-pressure suit or high-altitude &quot;skafandr&quot; (&quot;скафандр&quot;) in 1931. (скафандр also means &quot;diving suit&quot;).
* Emilio Herrera designed and built a full-pressure &quot;stratonautical space suit&quot; in 1935, which was to have been used during an open-basket balloon stratospheric flight scheduled for early 1936.
* Wiley Post experimented with a number of pressure suits for record-breaking flights.
* Russell Colley created the space suits worn by the Project Mercury astronauts, including fitting Alan Shepard for his ride as America&#x27;s first man in space on May 5, 1961.

==List of space suit models==
===Soviet and Russian suit models===

* Orlan (&quot;Орлан&quot; meaning &quot;sea-eagle&quot; or &quot;bald eagle&quot;)&quot;&quot;suits for extravehicular activity, originally developed for the Soviet lunar program as a lunar orbit EVA suit. It is Russia&#x27;s current EVA suit. Used from 1977 to present.
===United States suit models===
*In the early 1950s, Siegfried Hansen and colleagues at Litton Industries designed and built a working hard-shell suit, which was used inside vacuum chambers and was the predecessor of space suits used in NASA missions.
*Navy Mark IV high-altitude/vacuum suitused for Project Mercury (1961–1963).
*Gemini space suits (1965–1966)there were three main variants developed: G3C designed for intra-vehicle use; G4C specially designed for EVA and intra-vehicle use; and a special G5C suit worn by the Gemini 7 crew for 14 days inside the spacecraft.
*Manned Orbiting Laboratory MH-7 space suits for the canceled MOL program.
*Apollo Block I A1C suit (1966–1967)a derivative of the Gemini suit, worn by primary and backup crews in training for two early Apollo missions. The nylon pressure garment melted and burned through in the Apollo 1 cabin fire. This suit became obsolete when crewed Block I Apollo flights were discontinued after the fire.
*Apollo/Skylab A7L EVA and Moon suitsThe Block II Apollo suit was the primary pressure suit worn for eleven Apollo flights, three Skylab flights, and the US astronauts on the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project between 1968 and 1975. The pressure garment&#x27;s nylon outer layer was replaced with fireproof Beta cloth after the Apollo 1 fire. This suit was the first to employ a liquid-cooled inner garment and outer micrometeoroid garment. Beginning with the Apollo 13 mission, it also introduced &quot;commander&#x27;s stripes&quot; so that a pair of space walkers will not appear identical on camera.
*Shuttle Ejection Escape Suitused from STS-1 (1981) to STS-4 (1982) by a two-man crew used in conjunction with the then-installed ejection seats. Derived from a USAF model. These were removed once the Shuttle became certified.
* From STS-5 (1982) to STS-51-L (1986) no pressure suits were worn during launch and reentry. The crew would wear only a blue-flight suit with an oxygen helmet.
*Launch Entry Suit first used on STS-26 (1988), the first flight after the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. It was a partial pressure suit derived from a USAF model. It was used from 1988 to 1998.
*Advanced Crew Escape Suit used on the Space Shuttle starting in 1994. The Advanced Crew Escape Suit or ACES suit, is a full-pressure suit worn by all Space Shuttle crews for the ascent and entry portions of flight. The suit is a direct descendant of the United States Air Force high-altitude pressure suits worn by SR-71 Blackbird and U-2 spy plane pilots, North American X-15 and Gemini pilot-astronauts, and the Launch Entry Suits worn by NASA astronauts starting on the STS-26 flight. It is derived from a USAF model.
*Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)used on both the Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS). The EMU is an independent anthropomorphic system that provides environmental protection, mobility, life support, and communications for a Space Shuttle or ISS crew member to perform an EVA in Earth orbit. Used from 1982 to present, but only available in limited sizing as of 2019.
*Aerospace company SpaceX developed an IVA suit which is worn by astronauts involved in Commercial Crew Program missions operated by SpaceX since the Demo-2 mission. As a continuation of this suit design, SpaceX developed an EVA suit in 2024. The EVA version of the suit was used during the Polaris Dawn private space mission for the first ever commercial spacewalk.
*Orion Crew Survival System (OCSS)will be used during launch and re-entry on the Orion MPCV. It is derived from the Advanced Crew Escape Suit but is able to operate at a higher pressure and has improved mobility in the shoulders.

==== SpaceX suit (&quot;Starman suit&quot;) ====
In February 2015, SpaceX began developing a space suit for astronauts to wear within the Dragon 2 space capsule. Its appearance was jointly designed by Jose Fernandez—a Hollywood costume designer known for his works for superhero and science fiction films—and SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk. The first images of the suit were revealed in September 2017. A mannequin, called &quot;Starman&quot; (after David Bowie&#x27;s song of the same name), wore the SpaceX space suit during the maiden launch of the Falcon Heavy in February 2018. For this exhibition launch, the suit was not pressurized and carried no sensors.

The suit, which is suitable for vacuum, offers protection against cabin depressurization through a single tether at the astronaut&#x27;s thigh that feeds air and electronic connections. The helmets, which are 3D-printed, contain microphones and speakers. As the suits need the tether connection and do not offer protection against radiation, they are not used for extra-vehicular activities. The suits are custom-made for each astronaut.

In 2018, NASA commercial crew astronauts Bob Behnken, and Doug Hurley tested the spacesuit inside the Dragon 2 spacecraft in order to familiarize themselves with the suit. They wore it in the Crew Dragon Demo-2 flight launched on 30 May 2020. The suit is worn by astronauts involved in Commercial Crew Program missions involving SpaceX.

On 4 May 2024, SpaceX unveiled a spacesuit designed for extravehicular activity based on the IVA suit for Polaris Dawn mission in Polaris program. As with the IVA suit, the helmets are 3D-printed, though the EVA helmet incorporates a heads-up display providing information and a camera on suit metrics during operation. It is more mobile, includes new thermal insulation fabrics, and materials used Falcon’s interstage and Crew Dragon’s external unpressurized trunk.

====Future NASA contracted suits====
On 1 June 2022, NASA announced it had selected competing Axiom Space and Collins Aerospace to develop and provide astronauts with next generation spacesuit and spacewalk systems to first test and later use outside the International Space Station, as well as on the lunar surface for the crewed Artemis missions, and prepare for human missions to Mars.

===Chinese suit models===
* Shuguang space suit: First generation EVA space suit developed by China for the 1967 canceled &quot;Project 714&quot; crewed space program. It has a mass of about , has an orange colour, and is made of high-resistance multi-layer polyester fabric. The astronaut could use it inside the cabin and conduct an EVA as well.
* &quot;&#x27;Project 863&quot; space suit: Cancelled project of second generation Chinese EVA space suit.
* Shenzhou IVA (神舟) space suit: The suit was first worn by Yang Liwei on Shenzhou 5, the first crewed Chinese space flight, it closely resembles a Sokol-KV2 suit, but it is believed to be a Chinese-made version rather than an actual Russian suit. Pictures show that the suits on Shenzhou 6 differ in detail from the earlier suit; they are also reported to be lighter.
* Haiying (海鹰号航天服) EVA space suit: The imported Russian Orlan-M EVA suit is called &quot;Haiying&quot;. Used on Shenzhou 7.
* Feitian (飞天号航天服) EVA space suit: Indigenously developed Chinese-made EVA space suit also used for the Shenzhou 7 mission. The suit was designed for a spacewalk mission of up to seven hours. Chinese astronauts have been training in the out-of-capsule space suits since July 2007, and movements are seriously restricted in the suits, with a mass of more than each. A new generation of Feitian space suit has been used since 2021 as the construction of Tiangong Space Station began.

==Emerging technologies==

Several companies and universities are developing technologies and prototypes which represent improvements over current space suits.

=== Additive manufacturing ===
3D printing (additive manufacturing) can be used to reduce the mass of hard-shell space suits while retaining the high mobility they provide. This fabrication method also allows for the potential for in-situ fabrication and repair of suits, a capability which is not currently available, but will likely be necessary for Martian exploration. The University of Maryland began development of a prototype 3D printed hard suit in 2016, based on the kinematics of the AX-5. The prototype arm segment is designed to be evaluated in the Space Systems Laboratory glovebox to compare mobility to traditional soft suits. Initial research has focused on the feasibility of printing rigid suit elements, bearing races, ball bearings, seals, and sealing surfaces.

=== Astronaut Glove Challenge ===
There are certain difficulties in designing a dexterous space suit glove and there are limitations to the current designs. For this reason, the Centennial Astronaut Glove Challenge was created to build a better glove. Competitions have been held in 2007 and 2009, and another is planned. The 2009 contest required the glove to be covered with a micro-meteorite layer.

===Aouda.X===

Since 2009, the Austrian Space Forum has been developing &quot;Aouda.X&quot;, an experimental Mars analogue space suit focusing on an advanced human–machine interface and on-board computing network to increase situational awareness. The suit is designed to study contamination vectors in planetary exploration analogue environments and create limitations depending on the pressure regime chosen for a simulation.

Since 2012, for the Mars2013 analogue mission by the Austrian Space Forum to Erfoud, Morocco, the Aouda.X analogue space suit has a sister in the form of Aouda.S. This is a slightly less sophisticated suit meant primarily to assist Aouda.X operations and be able to study the interactions between two (analogue) astronauts in similar suits.

The Aouda.X and Aouda.S space suits have been named after the fictional princess from the Jules Verne&#x27;s 1873 novel &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;. A public display mock-up of Aouda.X (called Aouda.D) is currently on display at the Dachstein Ice Cave in Obertraun, Austria, after the experiments done there in 2012.

=== Axiom Space and Prada ===
In 2024, at the International Astronautical Congress in Milan, Italy, Axiom Space and Prada showed the results of an ongoing collaboration to develop a spacesuit for NASA&#x27;s Artemis III mission.

===Bio-Suit===
Bio-Suit is a space activity suit under development at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which consisted of several lower leg prototypes. Bio-suit is custom fit to each wearer, using laser body scanning.

=== Constellation Space Suit system ===
On August 2, 2006, NASA indicated plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the design, development, certification, production, and sustaining engineering of the Constellation Space Suit to meet the needs of the Constellation Program. NASA foresaw a single suit capable of supporting: survivability during launch, entry and abort; zero-gravity EVA; lunar surface EVA; and Mars surface EVA.

On June 11, 2008, NASA awarded a US$745 million contract to Oceaneering International to create the new space suit.

=== Final Frontier Design IVA Space Suit===
Final Frontier Design (FFD) is developing a commercial full IVA space suit, with their first suit completed in 2010. FFD&#x27;s suits are intended as a light-weight, highly mobile, and inexpensive commercial space suits. Since 2011, FFD has upgraded IVA suit&#x27;s designs, hardware, processes, and capabilities. FFD has built a total of 7 IVA space suit (2016) assemblies for various institutions and customers since founding, and has conducted high fidelity human testing in simulators, aircraft, microgravity, and hypobaric chambers. FFD has a Space Act Agreement with NASA&#x27;s Commercial Space Capabilities Office to develop and execute a Human Rating Plan for FFD IVA suit. FFD categorizes their IVA suits according to their mission: Terra for Earth-based testing, Stratos for high altitude flights, and Exos for orbital space flights. Each suit category has different requirements for manufacturing controls, validations, and materials, but are of a similar architecture.

===I-Suit===
The I-Suit is a space suit prototype also constructed by ILC Dover, which incorporates several design improvements over the EMU, including a weight-saving soft upper torso. Both the Mark III and the I-Suit have taken part in NASA&#x27;s annual Desert Research and Technology Studies (D-RATS) field trials, during which suit occupants interact with one another, and with rovers and other equipment.

===Mark III===
The Mark III is a NASA prototype, constructed by ILC Dover, which incorporates a hard lower torso section and a mix of soft and hard components. The Mark III is markedly more mobile than previous suits, despite its high operating pressure (), which makes it a &quot;zero-prebreathe&quot; suit, meaning that astronauts would be able to transition directly from a one-atmosphere, mixed-gas space station environment, such as that on the International Space Station, to the suit, without risking decompression sickness, which can occur with rapid depressurization from an atmosphere containing nitrogen or another inert gas.

=== MX-2 ===
The MX-2 is a space suit analogue constructed at the University of Maryland&#x27;s Space Systems Laboratory. The MX-2 is used for crewed neutral buoyancy testing at the Space Systems Lab&#x27;s Neutral Buoyancy Research Facility. By approximating the work envelope of a real EVA suit, without meeting the requirements of a flight-rated suit, the MX-2 provides an inexpensive platform for EVA research, compared to using EMU suits at facilities like NASA&#x27;s Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory.

The MX-2 has an operating pressure of 2.5–4 psi. It is a rear-entry suit, featuring a fiberglass HUT. Air, LCVG cooling water, and power are open loop systems, provided through an umbilical. The suit contains a Mac Mini computer to capture sensor data, such as suit pressure, inlet and outlet air temperatures, and heart rate. Resizable suit elements and adjustable ballast allow the suit to accommodate subjects ranging in height from , and with a weight range of .

===North Dakota suit===
Beginning in May 2006, five North Dakota colleges collaborated on a new space suit prototype, funded by a US$100,000 grant from NASA, to demonstrate technologies which could be incorporated into a planetary suit. The suit was tested in the Theodore Roosevelt National Park badlands of western North Dakota. The suit has a mass of without a life support backpack, and costs only a fraction of the standard US$12,000,000 cost for a flight-rated NASA space suit. The suit was developed in just over a year by students from the University of North Dakota, North Dakota State, Dickinson State, the state College of Science and Turtle Mountain Community College. The mobility of the North Dakota suit can be attributed to its low operating pressure; while the North Dakota suit was field tested at a pressure of differential, NASA&#x27;s EMU suit operates at a pressure of , a pressure designed to supply approximately sea-level oxygen partial pressure for respiration (see discussion above).

===PXS===
NASA&#x27;s Prototype eXploration Suit (PXS), like the Z-series, is a rear-entry suit compatible with suitports. The suit has components which could be 3D printed during missions to a range of specifications, to fit different individuals or changing mobility requirements.

=== Suitports ===
A suitport is a theoretical alternative to an airlock, designed for use in hazardous environments and in human spaceflight, especially planetary surface exploration. In a suitport system, a rear-entry space suit is attached and sealed against the outside of a spacecraft, such that an astronaut can enter and seal up the suit, then go on EVA, without the need for an airlock or depressurizing the spacecraft cabin. Suitports require less mass and volume than airlocks, provide dust mitigation, and prevent cross-contamination of the inside and outside environments. Patents for suitport designs were filed in 1996 by Philip Culbertson Jr. of NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center and in 2003 by Joerg Boettcher, Stephen Ransom, and Frank Steinsiek.

===Z-series===
In 2012, NASA introduced the Z-1 space suit, the first in the Z-series of space suit prototypes designed by NASA specifically for planetary extravehicular activity. The Z-1 space suit includes an emphasis on mobility and protection for space missions. It features a soft torso versus the hard torsos seen in previous NASA EVA space suits, which reduces mass. It has been labeled the &quot;Buzz Lightyear suit&quot; due to its green streaks for a design.

In 2014, NASA released the design for the Z-2 prototype, the next model in the Z-series. NASA conducted a poll asking the public to decide on a design for the Z-2 space suit. The designs, created by fashion students from Philadelphia University, were &quot;Technology&quot;, &quot;Trends in Society&quot;, and &quot;Biomimicry&quot;. The design &quot;Technology&quot; won, and the prototype is built with technologies like 3D printing. The Z-2 suit will also differ from the Z-1 suit in that the torso reverts to the hard shell, as seen in NASA&#x27;s EMU suit.

==In fiction==

Space suits are a common staple of science fiction. They appeared in sf works as early as 19th century (Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, 1865).

<text>An engagement ring, also known as a betrothal ring, is a ring indicating that the person wearing it is engaged to be married, especially in Western cultures. A ring is presented as an engagement gift by a partner to their prospective spouse when they propose marriage to represent a formal agreement to future marriage. In most Western countries, engagement rings are usually worn only by women, and they are typically adorned with diamonds. In some countries, partners wear matching rings, and engagement rings may also be used as wedding rings. In the Anglosphere, the ring is customarily worn on the left hand ring finger, but customs vary across the world.

Engagement rings have been common in Western countries since at least the time of the Roman Empire. They began to feature diamonds during the Renaissance, although most commoners could not afford diamond rings prior to the discovery of the South African diamond mines in the 19th century. Historically, engagement rings were blessed and then worn during the betrothal ceremony of a couple, but neither the engagement ring nor any other ring is worn at the time when the wedding ring is put by the groom on the finger of the bride as part of the marriage ceremony, and sometimes by the bride onto the groom&#x27;s finger. After the wedding, the engagement ring is usually put back on and is usually worn on the outside of the wedding ring. In the present-day, the giving of the engagement ring &quot;constitutes the subarration&quot;.

==History==
===Ancient times===
Although the ancient Egyptians are sometimes credited with inventing the engagement ring, and the ancient Greeks with adopting the tradition, the history of the engagement ring can only be reliably traced as far back as ancient Rome.

In many countries, engagement rings are placed on the ring finger of the left hand. At one time it was believed that this finger contained a vein (the vena amoris) that led to the heart. This idea was popularized by Henry Swinburne in &quot;A treatise of Spousals, or Matrimonial Contracts&quot; (1686). The story seems to have its origin in the ancient Roman book &quot;Attic Nights&quot; by Aulus Gellius quoting Apion&#x27;s &quot;Aegyptiacorum&quot;, where the alleged vein was originally a &quot;nervus&quot; (a word that can be translated either as &quot;nerve&quot; or &quot;sinew&quot;).

The popular belief that an engagement ring was originally part of the bride price which represented purchase and ownership of the bride, has been called into question by contemporary scholarship.

In the second century BC, the Roman bride-to-be was given two rings, a gold one which she wore in public, and one made of iron which she wore at home while attending to household duties. At one time Roman citizens wore rings made of iron. In later years senators who served as ambassadors were given gold seal rings for official use when abroad. Later the privilege of wearing gold rings was extended to other public officials, then to the knights, later to all freeborn, and finally under Justinian, to freedmen. For several centuries it was the custom for Romans to wear iron rings at home, gold rings in public. During this period a girl or woman might receive two engagement rings, one of iron and one of gold.

===Middle Ages===
The mid-7th century Visigothic Code required &quot;that when the ceremony of betrothal has been performed ... and the ring shall have been given or accepted as a pledge, although nothing may have been committed to writing, the promise shall, under no circumstances, be broken.&quot;

In 860 AD, Pope Nicholas I wrote a letter to Boris I of Bulgaria in reply to questions regarding differences between Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox practices. Pope Nicholas describes how in the Western church the man gives his betrothed an engagement ring. At the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215, convoked by Pope Innocent III, the banns of marriage was instituted, prohibiting clandestine marriages and requiring that marriages be made public in advance. Some legal scholars have seen in this a parallel with the engagement-ring tradition described by Pope Nicholas I.

===Renaissance===

The first well-documented use of a diamond ring to signify engagement was by the Archduke Maximilian of Austria in the imperial court of Vienna in 1477, upon his betrothal to Mary of Burgundy. This then influenced those of higher social class and of significant wealth to give diamond rings to their loved ones.

===Reformation===
During the Protestant Reformation the wedding ring replaced the betrothal ring as the primary ring associated with marriage. In Catholic countries the transition took place somewhat later.

===Enlightenment===
During the Age of Enlightenment both the gimmal rings and posie rings were popular, although the latter was more often used as an expression of sentiment than to indicate a formal engagement.

===Victorian era===
In South Africa, diamonds were first found in 1866, although they were not identified as such until 1867. By 1872, the output of the diamond mines exceeded one million carats per year. As production increased, those of lesser means were able to join in on this movement. However, diamond engagement rings were for a long time seen as the domain of the nobility and aristocracy, and tradition often favoured simpler engagement bands.

In 1852, the Koh-i-Noor diamond was re-cut and embellished in Queen Victoria&#x27;s crown. This triggered a diamond rush throughout the world.

===20th century===
In the United States, the popularity of diamond engagement rings declined after World War I, even more so than after the onset of the Great Depression. 

In 1938, the diamond cartel De Beers began a marketing campaign that would have a major impact on engagement rings. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the price of diamonds collapsed. At the same time, market research indicated that engagement rings were going out of style with the younger generation. Before World War II, only 10% of American engagement rings contained a diamond. While the first phase of the marketing campaign consisted of market research, the advertising phase began in 1939. One of the first elements of this campaign was to educate the public about the 4 Cs (cut, carats, color, and clarity). In 1947 the slogan &quot;a diamond is forever&quot; was introduced. Ultimately, the De Beers campaign sought to persuade the consumer that an engagement ring is indispensable, and that a diamond is the only acceptable stone for an engagement ring. The sales of diamonds in the United States rose from $23 million to $2.1 billion between 1939 and 1979.

Law professor Margaret F. Brining links the surge in engagement ring sales in the USA after 1945 to the abolishment of the &quot;breach of promise&quot;, that had entitled a woman whose fiancé had broken off their engagement to sue him for damages. This rule of law was especially important for many women who had been sexually intimate with the fiancé, but were socially expected to be virgins in a new marriage, therefore lost &quot;market value&quot;. After the gradual abolishment of that law action in all states the expensive engagement ring rose to popularity as a new financial security in case of a break-up, since it was custom for the women to keep the ring (partly only under the condition that the break-up was not seen as her fault).

=== 21st century ===
In the early 21st century, the jewellery industry started marketing engagement rings for men under the name &quot;mangagement rings&quot;.

==Industry==
In the 20th century, if he could afford it, the typical Western groom privately selected and purchased an engagement ring, which he then presented to his desired bride when he proposed marriage. In countries where both partners wear engagement rings, matching rings may be selected and purchased together. In the United States and Canada, where only women traditionally wear engagement rings, women also occasionally present their partners with an engagement gift.

Like all jewellery, the price for an engagement ring varies considerably depending on the materials used: the design of the ring, whether it includes a gemstone, the value of any gemstone, and the seller. The price of the gemstones, if any, in the ring depends on the type and quality of the gem. Diamonds have a standardized description that values them according to their carat weight, color, clarity, and cut. Other gemstones, such as sapphires, rubies, and emeralds have different systems. The jewellery may be chosen to honor a family tradition, to use family heirlooms, to have an unusual style, to have socially responsible characteristics (e.g., a style that is not associated with blood diamond controversy or the pollution caused by gold mining and cyanide process), to fit the individual&#x27;s stylistic preferences, or to manage cost. Synthetic diamonds and diamond substitutes such as cubic zirconias and moissanites are also popular choices that are socially responsible and reduce cost while maintaining the desired appearance.

The idea that a man should spend a significant fraction of his annual income for an engagement ring originated from De Beers marketing materials in the mid-20th century in an effort to increase the sale of diamonds. In the 1930s, they suggested that a man should spend the equivalent of one month&#x27;s income in the engagement ring. In the 1980s, they suggested that he should spend two months&#x27; income on it (three months in Japan). In 2012, the average cost of an engagement ring in the US as reported by the industry was US$4,000. In a 2015 scholarly study, almost a quarter of couples said that they did not buy a ring, and another third spent less than US$2000 on it. Less than 15% of couples spent $4,000 or more. In the UK, estimates of the average cost of an engagement ring range from £1200 to £2000. Scholarly research indicates that expensive engagement rings are associated with early divorces, possibly because spending more than US$2,000 on an engagement ring is strongly associated with debt-related stress. Couples that spend less money on engagement rings and the wedding ceremony tend to have longer marriages and a lower risk of divorce.

One reason for the increased popularity of expensive engagement rings is its relationship to human sexuality and the woman&#x27;s marriage prospects. In the United States, until the Great Depression, a man who broke off a marriage engagement could be sued for breach of promise. Monetary damages included actual expenses incurred in preparing for the wedding, plus damages for emotional distress and loss of other marriage prospects. Damages were greatly increased if the woman had engaged in sexual intercourse with her fiancé. Beginning in 1935, these laws were repealed or limited. However, the social and financial cost of a broken engagement was no less: marriage was the only financially sound option for most women, and if she was no longer a virgin, her prospects for a suitable future marriage were greatly decreased. The diamond engagement ring thus became a source of financial security for the woman.

The online purchase of engagement rings is growing, disrupting the market for the diamonds by bringing greater transparency to an industry that has traditionally relied on opacity. Online diamond retailers and e-commerce platforms include Blue Nile, Brilliant Earth, and Costco.

===Styles===

Engagement rings, like any other kind of jewellery, come in many different styles.

Gold (Available in Yellow Gold, White Gold and Rose Gold) and platinum are preferred for engagement rings, but common metal types such as titanium, silver, and stainless steel are also used for engagement rings. This allows for the bride-to-be to exert her own individual style into the ring in a simple manner.

In the United States, where engagement rings are worn by women, diamonds have been widely featured in engagement rings since the middle of the 20th century. Solitaire rings have one diamond. The most common setting for engagement rings is the solitaire prong setting, which was popularized by Tiffany &amp; Co. in 1886 and its six-claw prong setting design sold under the &quot;Tiffany setting&quot; trademark. The modern favorite cut for an engagement ring is the brilliant cut, which provides the maximum amount of sparkle to the gemstone. The traditional engagement rings may have different prong settings and bands. Another major category is engagement rings with side stones. Rings with a larger diamond set in the middle and smaller diamonds on the side fit under this category. Three-stone diamond engagement rings, sometimes called &quot;trinity rings&quot; or &quot;trilogy rings&quot;, are rings with three matching diamonds set horizontally in a row with the bigger stone placed in the center. The three diamonds on the ring are typically said to represent the couple&#x27;s past, present, and future, but other people give religious significance to the arrangement.

A wedding set, or bridal set, includes an engagement ring and a wedding band that matches and can be bought as a set. In some cases, the wedding ring looks incomplete; it is only when the two halves, engagement and wedding, are assembled that the ring looks whole. In other cases, a wedding set consists of two rings that match stylistically and are worn stacked, although either piece would look appropriate as a separate ring. Although the wedding band is not to be worn until the wedding day, the two rings are usually sold together as a wedding set. After the wedding, the bride may choose to have the two pieces welded together, to increase convenience and reduce the likelihood of losing one of the rings. A trio ring set includes a women&#x27;s engagement ring, a women&#x27;s wedding band, and a men&#x27;s wedding band. These sets often have matching rings and are lower in price.

In Nordic countries, engagement rings are worn by both men and women. Traditionally they are plain gold bands, although more ornate designs and other materials are gaining popularity. The engagement rings resemble the wedding bands sold in the United States, whereas women&#x27;s wedding rings may resemble US engagement rings.

In North America and the United Kingdom, it is customarily worn on the left hand ring finger. Similar traditions purportedly date to classical times, dating back from an early usage reportedly referring to the fourth finger of the left hand as containing the &quot;vena amoris&quot; or &quot;vein of love&quot;. This custom may have its origins in an ancient Egyptian myth that the finger contained a vein leading directly to the heart, or it may simply be because the heart lies slightly to the left side of the body. In Germany the ring is worn on the left hand while engaged, but moved to the right hand when married. In Poland and Turkey, the engagement ring and wedding band are traditionally worn on the right hand but modern practice varies considerably.

===Legal ownership===
Tradition generally holds that if the betrothal fails because the man himself breaks off the engagement, the woman is not obliged to return the ring. This reflects the ring&#x27;s role as a form of compensation for the woman&#x27;s damaged reputation. Legally, this condition can be subject to either a modified or a strict fault rule. Under the former, the fiancé can demand the return of the ring unless he breaks the engagement. Under the latter, the fiancé is entitled to the return unless his actions caused the breakup of the relationship, the same as the traditional approach. However, a no-fault rule is being advanced in some jurisdictions, under which the fiancé is always entitled to the return of the ring. The ring only becomes the property of the woman when marriage occurs. An unconditional gift approach is another possibility, wherein the ring is always treated as a gift, to be kept by the fiancée whether or not the relationship progresses to marriage. Recent court rulings have determined that the date in which the ring was offered can determine the condition of the gift. E.g. Valentine&#x27;s Day and Christmas are widely recognized as gift-giving holidays in the United States and some other countries. A ring offered in the form of a Christmas present is likely to remain the personal property of the recipient in the event of a breakup.

In most states of the United States, engagement rings are considered &quot;conditional gifts&quot; under the legal rules of property. This is an exception to the general rule that gifts cannot be revoked once properly given. See, for example, the case of &quot;Meyer v. Mitnick&quot;, 625 N.W.2d 136 (Michigan, 2001), whose ruling found the following reasoning persuasive: &quot;the so-called &#x27;modern trend&#x27; holds that because an engagement ring is an inherently conditional gift, once the engagement has been broken, the ring should be returned to the donor. Thus, the question of who broke the engagement and why, or who was &#x27;at fault,&#x27; is irrelevant. This is the no-fault line of cases.&quot; Though in certain states, whether a judicial action can be maintained at all to require return of an engagement ring is blocked by statute, as many states have statutes which state that no civil action shall be maintained for breach of promise to marry. A 2024 Massachusetts ruling adopting no-fault return (overturning a 1959 ruling) cited the adoption of no-fault divorce by the state legislature as a sign that this was the modern expectation.

One case in New South Wales, Australia ended in the man suing his former fiancée because she threw the ring away, after he told her she could keep it even though the marriage plans had fallen through. The Supreme Court of New South Wales held that, despite what the man said, the ring remained a conditional gift (partly because his saying that she could keep it reflected his desire to salvage the relationship) and she was ordered to pay him its A$15,250 cost.

In England and Wales, the gift of an engagement ring is presumed to be an absolute gift to the fiancée. This presumption may be rebutted however by proving that the ring was given on condition (express or implied) that it must be returned if the marriage did not take place, for whatever reason. This was decided in the case &quot;Jacobs v Davis&quot; (1917).

==Cultural variations==
In the historic Christian traditions of Catholicism, Lutheranism and Anglicanism, engagement rings are blessed by a priest or pastor and then worn by the couple during the betrothal rite (also known as &#x27;blessing an engaged couple&#x27; or &#x27;declaration of intention&#x27;).

In some countries it is common for both men and women to wear engagement rings. The rings are often in the form of a plain band of a precious metal. Sometimes, the engagement ring eventually serves as the wedding ring for the man. In Brazil, for example, the groom and bride-to-be usually wear a plain wedding band on the right hand during the course of their engagement. After the wedding, the band is moved to the left hand. In Argentina, it is also known for the groom and bride-to-be to wear a plain silver band on the left hand while engaged. Then, after the wedding the silver band is either replaced with the wedding ring or moved to the right hand.

Traditionally, women in the British Isles may propose marriage to men during a leap year. Women proposing has become more common in recent years, to the point that some jewellery companies have started manufacturing men&#x27;s engagement rings. They resemble typical men&#x27;s rings, often with a diamond centrepiece. In the countries where both sexes have traditionally worn engagement rings, the rings tend to be plainer bands, and there is no real difference between men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s engagement ring designs.

In Ireland, the Claddagh ring is a popular choice for engagements. It features a heart, crown, and hands, which symbolizes love, loyalty, and friendship. The way the ring is worn also holds significance; for instance, when worn on the left hand with the heart pointing inward, it indicates that the wearer is engaged.

In Kenya, traditional beaded jewelry often accompanies engagement rings. The vibrant beads symbolize cultural identity and heritage, and they celebrate the couple&#x27;s union in a way that honors the nation&#x27;s rich artistic traditions.

Engagement rings in India are often part of elaborate jewelry sets exchanged during traditional ceremonies. These rings, typically crafted from gold, align with cultural preferences for ornate and symbolic designs.

In Japan, engagement rings are known for their minimalist and high-quality designs. This reflects Japan&#x27;s cultural preference for simplicity and craftsmanship, with couples often choosing rings that prioritize subtlety and elegance.
