<text>The Tandy 1000 was the first in a series of IBM PC compatible home computers produced by the Tandy Corporation, sold through its Radio Shack and Radio Shack Computer Center stores. Introduced in 1984, the Tandy 1000 line was designed to offer affordable yet capable systems for home computing and education. Tandy-specific features, such as enhanced graphics, sound, and a built-in joystick port, made the computers particularly attractive for home use.

The Tandy 1000 series remained in production until its discontinuation in 1993, coinciding with Tandy&#x27;s exit from the PC market. Over its lifespan, the series included about a dozen models with various form factors, incorporating advancements in PC hardware technology and adopting more standardized components.

==Overview==
In December 1983, an executive with Tandy Corporation, maker of TRS-80 computers, said about the new IBM PCjr: &quot;I&#x27;m sure a lot of people will be coming out with PCjr look-alikes. The market is big.&quot; While preparing the Tandy 2000—the company&#x27;s first MS-DOS computer—for release in November 1983, Tandy began designing the Tandy 1000, code named &quot;August&quot;. Unlike the 2000 it would be PC compatible with the IBM PC, and support the PCjr graphics standard.

Released in November 1984, the $1,200 Tandy 1000 offers the same functionality as the PCjr, but with an improved keyboard and better expandability and compatibility. &quot;How could IBM have made that mistake with the PCjr?&quot; an amazed Tandy executive said regarding its chiclet keyboard, and another claimed that the 1000 &quot;is what the PCjr should have been&quot;.

The Tandy 2000—not completely PC compatible—quickly failed. Although the press saw the 1000 as former personal-computer leader Tandy admitting that it could no longer focus on proprietary products in a market the IBM PC dominated, the 1000 sold more units in the first month than any other Tandy product and by early 1985 was its best-selling computer. Although Tandy initially marketed the 1000 as a business computer like the IBM PC, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; stated in 1985 that the company &quot;produced a real home computer&quot;. The 1000 has joystick ports like the PCjr, and its 16-color graphics and 3-voice sound, but not the PCjr ROM cartridge ports. Since IBM discontinued the PCjr soon after the release of the 1000, Tandy quickly removed mentions of the PCjr in its advertising while emphasizing its product&#x27;s PC compatibility.

Tandy claimed that the 1000 was &quot;the first fully IBM PC-compatible computer available for less than $1000&quot;. It helped the company obtain a 9.5% share of the US home-computer market in 1986, a year in which Tandy stated that half of its compatibles were purchased for the home. In 1988 CEO John Roach disagreed with Apple counterpart John Sculley&#x27;s rejection of the home market: &quot;Let him deny it. He&#x27;s the only other person that&#x27;s well-represented in the home market, and if he wants to abandon it, it&#x27;s all right with me&quot;. Tandy also regained a significant share of the Apple-dominated educational market, which the two companies had once equally shared.

The 1000 and its many successors were successful unlike the PCjr. This was partly because it was sold in ubiquitous Radio Shack stores and partly because the computer was less costly, easier to expand, and almost entirely compatible with the IBM PC. The PCjr&#x27;s enhanced graphics and sound standards became known as &quot;Tandy-compatible&quot;. With its graphics, sound, and built-in joystick ports, the 1000 was the best computer for PC games until VGA graphics became popular in the 1990s. Software companies of the era advertised their support for the Tandy platform; 28 of 66 games that &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; tested in 1989 supported Tandy graphics.

===Design and architecture===
Tandy 1000 computers were some of the first IBM PC clones to incorporate a complete set of basic peripherals on the motherboard using proprietary ASICs, the forerunner of the chipset. Although the original Tandy 1000 comes in an IBM PC-like desktop case, some models, notably the 1000 EX and 1000 HX, use home-computer-style cases with the keyboard, motherboard and disk drives in one enclosure. This high level of integration made these machines a cost-effective alternative to larger and more complex IBM PC/XT and PC/AT-type systems, which require multiple add-in cards, often purchased separately, to implement a comparable feature-set to the Tandy 1000.

Being derived from IBM&#x27;s PCjr architecture, the Tandy 1000 offers several important features that most IBM PC-compatibles of the time lacks, such as the PCjr&#x27;s sound generator and extended CGA-compatible graphics controller. It also offers multiple built-in I/O ports, including a game port which was frequently a separate add-on card on non-Tandy machines.

The original line is equipped with the Intel 8088 CPU, which was later extended to faster clock speeds and also the 8086, 80286 and toward the end of the line with the RSX, 80386SX processors. Successors to the 1000 appended two or three letters to the name, after a space (e.g. Tandy 1000 EX and Tandy 1000 HX). In a few instances, after these letters a slash was appended, followed by either a number or additional letters (e.g. Tandy 1000 TL/2, Tandy 1000 RL/HD).

===Retirement===
By 1993, changes in the market made it increasingly difficult for Tandy Corporation to make a profit on its computer line. Tandy Corporation sold its computer manufacturing business to AST Computers, and all Tandy computer lines were terminated. Radio Shack stores then began selling computers made by other manufacturers, such as IBM and Compaq.

==Reception==
In an article subtitled &quot;Junior meets his match&quot;, John J. Anderson of &quot;Creative Computing&quot; called the original Tandy 1000 &quot;the machine IBM was too inept, incapable, or afraid to manufacture. It is sure to put a whopping dent not only into PCjr sales, but into sales of the PC &#x27;senior&#x27; as well&quot;. He favorably mentioned its low price, good PC-software compatibility, and bundled DeskMate (&quot;you might never need another software package for your computer&quot;). &quot;80 Micro&quot; approved of the 1000″s PC compatibility and stated that the exterior design &quot;gives it a feeling of quality and confidence&quot;. The magazine concluded that &quot;Tandy&#x27;s machine closely emulates the most basic functions of an IBM PC, and it does so at an affordable price ... along with the security of Tandy&#x27;s substantial support network&quot;, but wondered if people would buy the 1000 if IBM lowered the price of the PC.

&quot;InfoWorld&quot; highlighted the Tandy 1000&#x27;s affordability, noting that it was &quot;fully one-third less than a comparably equipped IBM PC.&quot; The magazine suggested that the computer was primarily aimed at &quot;the elusive home computer market&quot; and speculated that &quot;in retrospect it might have been the PCjr&#x27;s final straw.&quot; Describing the Tandy 1000 as &quot;almost as fully IBM PC compatible as a computer can get,&quot; &quot;InfoWorld&quot; gave a mixed review of the bundled DeskMate software and pointed out the system&#x27;s limitation in not supporting full-length PC expansion cards. The review concluded that &quot;by making the 1000 inexpensive and adaptable&quot; and including DeskMate, &quot;Tandy produced a real home computer.&quot;

&quot;BYTE&quot; called the 1000 &quot;a good, reasonably priced IBM PC clone that has most of the best features of the IBM PC and PCjr ... at current prices it is a very good alternative&quot;. It approved of the 1000&#x27;s use of the 2000&#x27;s keyboard, and high level of software compatibility. The magazine stated that DeskMate was &quot;fairly good ... but a little extra programming work could have turned [it] into a much better program&quot;, noting that—for example—the word processor did not have a Move command. &quot;BYTE&quot; also mentioned the computer&#x27;s short slots. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; also noted the slots and criticized the Tandy 1000&#x27;s fit and finish (&quot;not even close to the IBM standard&quot;), but acknowledged the computer&#x27;s low price and bundled hardware features.

==Technical details==
All Tandy 1000 computers feature built-in video hardware, enhanced sound hardware (based on one of several variants of the Texas Instruments SN76496 sound generator) and several peripheral interfaces, including game ports compatible with those on the TRS-80 Color Computer, an IBM-standard floppy-disk controller supporting two drives, and a parallel printer port, all integrated into the motherboard in addition to the hardware standard on the IBM PC/XT and, in later Tandy 1000 models, PC/AT motherboards.

For the original Tandy 1000, the designers omitted a direct memory access (DMA) controller because the PCjr does not have one, and they believed that those who needed it would add it with additional memory for the computer; they omitted the RS-232 port because all Tandy printers use the parallel port and, they believed, most customers would use internal modems. The earlier models of the Tandy 1000 have a composite video output, and can be used with a color or monochrome composite monitor, or a TV with an RF modulator. The original 1000 and SX has a light-pen port. Unlike most PC clones, several Tandy 1000 computers have MS-DOS built into ROM and can boot in a few seconds. Tandy bundled DeskMate, a graphical suite of consumer-oriented applications, with various Tandy 1000 models. 
Early Tandy 1000 models use Phoenix BIOS. Common models of the machine include the Tandy 1000, 1000 EX, 1000 HX, 1000 SX, 1000 TX, 1000 SL, 1000 RL, and 1000 TL. With the exception of the RLX and RSX, the Tandy 1000 machines are XT-class machines, which cannot support extended memory despite some models using 80286 processors. The RLX is an oddity, as it is an XT-class machine that supports 384 KB of extended memory, and the RSX is a fully AT-class machine which can support up to 9 MB of extended memory.

=== Expansion slots ===
With the exception of the 1000 EX and HX, Tandy used industry standard 8-bit XT ISA slots in their desktop models, including the SX, TX, SL, and TL series, but the actual length is limited to 10.5 inches or shorter, rather than the industry standard XT length of 13 inches. While many 8-bit cards meet this length requirement, some cards such as hard cards, EMS memory cards, and multifunction cards that require the standard 13&quot; length do not fit in the 1000s case. The EX and HX utilize a PLUS-style connector, which is electronically identical to an 8-bit XT ISA slot, but has a 62-pin pin header instead of a card edge, rendering it incompatible with ISA cards without an adapter. The PLUS connector was designed for compactness in these models with built-in keyboards. The 1000 RSX features two 16-bit AT ISA slots.

===Hard disk drives===
As hard disk drives at the time of the Tandy 1000&#x27;s introduction were very expensive, Tandy 1000 systems are not usually equipped with hard drives. However, it is possible to add a hard drive to most Tandy 1000 computers. Most of the desktop-type Tandy 1000 units can accept regular 8-bit ISA bus MFM, RLL and SCSI controllers like typical XT-class machines; however, care has to be taken when configuring the cards so that they do not cause conflicts with the on-board Tandy-designed peripherals.

For most Tandy 1000 models (other than the compact EX and HX) that do not come equipped with a hard drive, Tandy offered hard disk options in the form of hardcards that are installed in one of the computer&#x27;s expansion slots and consist of a controller and drive (typically a 3.5-inch MFM or RLL unit with a Western Digital controller) mounted together on a metal bracket. Their own 20 MB hard card was offered for $799, though compatible third-party units were available. Although this arrangement provides a neat physical coupling between the controller and the disk, single-sector internal transfers and dependence on the speed of the host machine to transfer data to memory means that a trial-and-error approach was still needed to set the disk interleave correctly to ensure optimum transfer rates. Furthermore, as the Tandy 1000&#x27;s slots are only 10.5&quot; long and are 8-bit only, some units do not fit and/or operate correctly unless they are certified to be Tandy-compatible.

Starting with the Tandy 1000 TL/2, XT IDE controllers are integrated onto the motherboard. However, these are incompatible with common AT IDE hard drives. The TL/2, TL/3, RL and RLX all use the XT IDE interface, where the later (and significantly upgraded) RSX is the only Tandy 1000 model computer to use a standard AT IDE interface. One option for modern users of these systems is to install and use XT ISA CompactFlash adapter; this is also the most practical way to install a hard drive into a Tandy 1000 EX or HX, using an adapter cable that adapts the male PLUS-style connector to an 8-bit ISA card-edge slot.

=== I/O and ports ===
Tandy 1000, SX, and TX use a proprietary 8-pin round DIN connector for the keyboard port that is compatible with the older TRS computers but not compatible with the IBM PC/AT or PS/2 standard. Some scan codes differ between the Tandy 1000 and IBM PC/XT and AT, resulting in software compatibility issues. The SL/TL and later use a more directly PC/XT-compatible keyboard protocol, and the 1000 RSX uses a PC/AT and PS/2-compatible protocol.

Tandy 1000 uses a proprietary 6-pin female round connector for the joystick port that on the SX/TX is adjacent to the keyboard port in the front of the computer. It is compatible with Color Computer joysticks, but not compatible with the IBM standard 15-pin male game port. Some DOS games do not work with these joystick ports, but those that support Tandy 1000 graphics and sound work.

Early Tandy 1000 models use the TRS-80 card-edge parallel printer port rather than industry standard DB-25 printer port, requiring a compatible printer cable to connect to a standard printer parallel port. This was later changed to a standard DB-25 connector on the 1000 RL.

Tandy 1000TX and beyond use a proprietary floppy drive cable port, that also powers the floppy drive. It requires a Tandy 1000-compatible floppy drive, though it may be possible to modify a floppy drive cable to make a standard floppy drive work.

=== Operating systems and environments ===
Tandy shipped PCs with their own customized version of MS-DOS, which are compatible with Tandy graphics and keyboard. The most current version of MS-DOS for Tandy 1000 is DOS 3.22. Tandy 1000s came shipped with one of several varieties of DeskMate, the company&#x27;s own GUI productivity software suite.

There may be compatibility issues with later versions of DOS such as DOS 5 and DOS 6. Until the 1000 RLX, Tandy 1000s are typically limited to 640 KB main memory, and non-Tandy versions of DOS often reduce the memory available for applications and games. In addition, the hardware detection routine for the installer of Microsoft MS-DOS 6 can corrupt the serial EEPROM of Tandy 1000 HX machines.

Tandy 1000s can work with Windows 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 but not 3.1, with the exception of the RLX which can run Windows 3.1 in Standard mode, and the RSX which fully supports Windows 3.1 in 386 Enhanced mode.

=== Peripherals ===

==== Monitors ====
Tandy offered two color monitors specific for its Tandy 1000 computers: the CM-5, with a 0.64 millimeter dot pitch, and the Tandy CM-11 with a dot pitch of 0.42 mm. Both are 13-inch displays and have a power cable and a nine-pin RGB cable to attach to the Tandy CGA port. The more expensive CM-11 also supports a special proprietary Tandy-enhanced 225 scan line text display mode.

Tandy also offered monochrome monitors that support MDA and Hercules standard that also work with Tandy 1000. As it uses a CGA-compatible interface, non-Tandy monitors that support CGA should work.

==== Keyboard ====
The original Tandy 1000, SX, EX, TX, HX use a proprietary keyboard and keyboard layout that is not compatible with the PC/XT/AT standard. The layout of the keyboard prefigured the IBM Model M keyboard, with function keys arranged in a row at the top, instead of on the left as in the PC and PC XT/AT. Later models of the Tandy 1000 series, such as the 1000 SL, TL, and RL series use a keyboard more similar and compatible with the IBM PS/2 series keyboard connector and layout.

==== Mouse options ====
As the Tandy 1000 uses the same game ports as the Tandy Color Computer series, the 26-3025 Color Mouse and 26-3125 Deluxe Mouse are compatible with the Tandy 1000, though not all DOS software and drivers recognize them. The Tandy Digi-Mouse requires a separate controller that was available in either ISA or PLUS format. Systems with RS-232C serial ports can use standard serial mice, and later systems, such as the 1000 RL, feature a PS/2 mouse connector.

==== Joystick options ====

Radio Shack offered a two-button joystick with its proprietary 6-pin DIN joystick connector that is compatible with the older TRS-80 Color Computer but not standard 15-pin IBM PC game ports often found on sound cards and i/o multifunction ISA cards. It works with many games written to take advantage of Tandy graphics and sound.

==== Modem options ====

Radio Shack offered Tandy 1000 PLUS 300-Baud PC Modem that is compatible with the 1000EX/HX that used PLUS slots. Radio Shack also offered 2400-baud internal modem. Third party modems with speeds of 14k baud should work provided they are eight-bit ISA, and fit.

==== Printers ====
Radio Shack sold the Tandy DMP-130A dot matrix printers to go along with their Tandy 1000 line, along with compatible card-edged printer cable. This printer was sold at home budget prices. Radio Shack often offered a package bundle with a Tandy 1000 computer, CM-5 budget monitor and DMP-130A printer. Using specially-designed aftermarket cables, it is possible to connect non-Tandy printers to the system.

==== Apple IIe compatibility ====
Tandy wanted to compete in the education, school and home markets dominated by the Apple IIe. In 1987, the company partnered with Diamond and through Radio Shack sold the Diamond Trackstar 128 series Apple IIe compatibility board for $399, and offered free installation in their Tandy 1000 series. This peripheral is similar to the Apple IIe Card sold later for certain Macintosh models; it is a fully functional Apple IIe clone with 128KB RAM and 6502 CPU and double high-resolution graphics, which allows Tandy 1000 computers to run software written for the Apple IIe and IIc platform. It was also marketed to home users and businesses interested in having both MS-DOS and Apple II compatibility.

The board has a pass-through RGB cable and floppy drive cable, and requires an open 10-inch 8-bit ISA slot, and uses a boot disk to boot into Apple mode. The boot disk has both DOS and Apple software and is copy-protected. Compatibility is fairly good and allows Tandy 1000 owners to run most Apple II software on their Tandy 1000 machine for less than the cost of owning separate IBM PC and Apple II systems.

Many Tandy 1000s sold to schools came with the Diamond Trackstar 128 installed, and home owners also purchased this for compatibility with both DOS and Apple II software.

== System specifications ==
=== Full-size desktop systems ===
===Compact and all-in-one systems===
==Selected models==

===Tandy 1000===
The original Tandy 1000 is a large computer almost the size of the , though with a plastic case over an aluminium lower chassis to reduce weight. 
It came standard with one internal 5.25&quot; double-density floppy disk drive, with an additional exposed internal bay usable for the installation of a second 5.25&quot; disk drive (available as a kit from Radio Shack). The floppy drives use jumpers to select the drive number instead of the IBM cable twist. The standard memory is , with the computer accepting up to of total memory with the addition of expansion cards.

MS-DOS 2.11, DeskMate 1.0, and a keyboard with the same layout as the Tandy 2000&#x27;s are included with the computer. Like the PCjr, the Tandy 1000 motherboard does not supply DMA, but unlike that system, it can have DMA added with a memory expansion board. While the Tandy 1000 has three XT-compatible expansion slots, early Tandy memory upgrade boards take up two of the slots to get to . Because the slots are inches in length instead of the PC&#x27;s 13 inches, full-length cards do not fit, but reviewers noted that the many built-in hardware features reduce the need for cards.

A later revision of the original Tandy 1000 model is the Tandy 1000A. This revision fixed bugs, scans expansion cards for bootable ROMs, and adds a socket for an Intel 8087 math coprocessor.

===Tandy 1000 HD===
The original Tandy 1000 (and many other models), like most home computers sold at the time, does not have a hard disk drive. The Tandy 1000 HD is essentially a Tandy 1000A with a hard disk option factory installed. The factory hard disk has a capacity on the order of 10 or 20 MB.

===Tandy 1000 SX and TX===

The Tandy 1000 SX and TX are upgraded versions of the original Tandy 1000, utilizing a similar chassis. Two major upgrades over the original Tandy 1000 are the inclusion of a DMA controller, which improved the speed of diskette operations and IBM PC-compatibility of these systems, and the addition of two additional ISA expansion slots, to offer a total of five 8-bit ISA slots.

====1000 SX====
The Tandy 1000 SX uses a 7.16 MHz 8088-2 processor, has 384 KB of memory (upgradeable to 640 KB on the motherboard), comes with either one or two 5.25&quot; internal floppy disk drives, and has the light pen port (not a serial port) like the original Tandy 1000. An adjustable potentiometer inside the system controls the volume of the internal speaker. The Tandy AX is an SX rebadged for sale in Walmart stores. The 1000 SX comes with MS-DOS 3.2 and DeskMate II on 5.25&quot; 360 KB diskettes.

The SX is the first Tandy 1000 in which the built-in video circuitry can be disabled via the installation of an upgraded graphics card, typically an EGA or VGA card, in an expansion slot.

====1000 TX====
The Tandy 1000 TX is similar to the 1000 SX with its detached keyboard, unique parallel port edge connector, and XT-style architecture in a slightly modified case. The major difference is the 80286 CPU clocked at 8 MHz. It features a 16-bit-wide memory bus, although the on-board peripherals and ISA slots are 8 bits wide.

The TX has a 3.5&quot; internal floppy disk drive mounted in a 5.25&quot; bay with room for an optional second internal 3.5&quot; or 5.25&quot; floppy disk drive. The rear panel has the same ports as the 1000 SX, except that an RS-232C serial port replaces the light-pen port. The memory size is 640 KB, with sockets for an additional 128 KB devoted to the onboard video logic. This extra 128 KB can only be used for and by the on-board video controller, so it is impractical to expand the on-board memory beyond 640 KB if a VGA graphics card is installed. The computer comes bundled with Personal DeskMate 2.

The TX is the last 1000-series computer to use DIP switches to store the system configuration parameters. All later 1000s rely on serial EEPROM chips to store configuration settings.

===Tandy 1000 EX and HX===
The Tandy 1000 EX and HX were designed as entry-level IBM-compatible personal computers, and marketed as starter systems for people new to computing. They were offered in a compact, all-in-one chassis that features a 7.16 MHz 8088 (capable of clocking down to 4.77 MHz), 256 KB of memory (expandable to 640 KB with a PLUS memory expansion board), PCjr- and CGA-compatible Tandy Video graphics controller, a keyboard and, depending on the model, either a single 5.25&quot; 360 KB floppy drive, or one to two 3.5&quot; 720 KB floppy drives.

An external floppy drive can be connected to a port on the back. The machine itself supplies power to the external drive, so only Tandy&#x27;s floppy drive unit is usable with the EX and HX. The external drive is the standard 360 KB 5.25&quot; format; in 1988 a 720 KB 3.5&quot; model was offered.

The EX and HX are upgradable via Tandy PLUS cards, and these systems have bays for three cards. A PLUS card connector is electrically identical to an ISA slot connector, but uses a Berg-style 62-pin connector instead of a 62-contact ISA card-edge connector. Other PLUS cards can be installed to add serial ports, a 1200-baud modem, a clock/calendar and bus mouse board, or a proprietary Tandy network interface. Radio Shack later sold an adapter card allowing installation of a PLUS card into a standard ISA slot, such as those in the larger Tandy 1000 models.

Like the original Tandy 1000, the EX and HX do not have a built-in DMA controller, though one can be added using the PLUS memory expansion board.

====1000 EX====

The Tandy 1000 EX features a 5.25&quot; floppy drive built into the right-hand side of computer casing. The EX sold for US$1,000 from Radio Shack in December 1986. The EX and, later, the HX were among the most popular of the Tandy 1000 line because of their low price.

A useful feature for the EX and later systems is the ability to boot off either drive, as the drives can be logically swapped when the system booted, so that the drive that was normally drive B: becomes drive A:, and vice versa, and the drives remain swapped until the system is powered off or reset. (The SX and TX have this capability as well.)

The 1000 EX comes with MS-DOS 2.11 and Personal Deskmate on 5.25&quot; 360 KB diskettes. The MS-DOS is a version specialized for and only bootable on the Tandy 1000; it includes a version of BASICA (Microsoft&#x27;s Advanced GW-BASIC) with support for the enhanced CGA graphics modes (a.k.a. Tandy Graphics or TGA) and three-voice sound hardware of the Tandy 1000.

====1000 HX====

The Tandy 1000 HX is an updated version of the EX, released in 1987. It utilizes the same architecture and PLUS cards as the EX, but with two 3.5&quot; bays on the front panel, occupied by one or two 720 KB 3.5&quot; floppy drives, as opposed to a single side-mounted 5.25&quot; bay and floppy drive. It also has Tandy MS-DOS 2.11R in ROM, which can be accessed by starting the computer with no bootable disk. Another improvement over the EX is the addition of a serial EEPROM to store configuration information, enabling similar functionality to later CMOS NVRAMs. By comparison, earlier Tandy 1000 models, like IBM PC and PC/XT systems, use DIP switches and jumpers for startup configuration settings.

By putting the basic elements of DOS in ROM and eliminating the memory test on startup, the HX boots quickly compared to other contemporary MS-DOS machines, despite having no immediate provisions for a hard disk drive.

In addition to Tandy MS-DOS 2.11R, the HX shipped with Personal Deskmate 2. Most versions of MS-DOS works with the 1000 HX, including DOS 3.x and some later versions; DOS 4.0 is incompatible, and the installer for MS-DOS 6 can corrupt the contents of the serial EEPROM.

===Tandy 1000 SL and TL series===
The Tandy SL and TL series of computers are updates of the SX and TX, respectively. In addition to offering redesigned cases, the machines offer a more integrated motherboard with improved graphics and sound capabilities while dropping composite video output. The graphics controller supports resolution as well as a Hercules Graphics Card-compatible, mode for monochrome monitors. Sound capabilities now include an 8-bit monaural DAC/ADC similar in function to parallel port sound devices (such as the Covox Speech Thing and Disney Sound Source) but extended to support DMA transfers, microphone input capability, and sampling rates up to 48 kHz. The SL/TL allow the on-board floppy controller, parallel port and serial ports to be disabled, which the earlier models do not.

The SL and TL were shipped with MS-DOS 3.3 and DeskMate 3 in ROM, and feature a serial EEPROM memory chip to store BIOS settings. The machines can also run generic MS-DOS 3.x, 5.x, and 6.x and Windows 2.x and 3.0 operating systems, although Windows is limited to real-mode operations. In common with many PC clones of the era, MS-DOS 4 is problematic and generally avoided.

====1000 SL and SL/2====

The Tandy 1000 SL and SL/2 feature an Intel 8086 processor running at 8 MHz. This is socketed, and thus upgradeable with an NEC V30. The SL comes with of RAM preinstalled, whereas the SL/2 offers . Both machines can be expanded to , although the graphics controller reserves a portion of this memory, yielding only to the operating system, even on systems using add-in ISA graphic cards. The SL line has the mic/earphone ports, volume knob, and reset button on a small satellite board. A jumper on the board allows the user to change the microphone input to a line-level output. The SL series offers five 8-bit XT-compatible ISA slots, and does not come with pre-installed real-time clock chips, making them optional upgrades in the form of the plug-in Dallas DS1216E SmartWatch.

The SL is the only machine in the line that offers an upper 5.25&quot; bay, and therefore the only model to offer two 5.25&quot; bays, where the other models, including the SL/2 and the entire TL range, feature two upper 3.5&quot; bays and one lower 5.25&quot; bay. As a result, fitting a hard drive to an SL that already has the upper and lower 5.25&quot; bays populated may require either the removal of one of the devices in those bays, or the installation of a hard disk card-style bracket which seats in one of the ISA slots.

====1000 TL, TL/2 and TL/3====
The Tandy 1000 TL and TL/2 uses 8 MHz Intel 80286 processors, whereas the TL/3 uses a 10 MHz 80286. The TLs has 640 KB of memory preinstalled, with an option for an extra 128 KB for video frame buffering just as in the 1000 TX. Unlike the SL series machines, the TL series comes with the SmartWatch real-time clock logic built-in, which is powered by a removable 3-volt CR2032 button-cell battery on the motherboard.

The TL offers five 8-bit XT-compatible ISA slots, while the TL/2 and TL/3 offer four slots and an on-board 8-bit, XT IDE-compatible hard disk interface, which is not compatible with standard AT IDE hard drives. The TL series offers two upper 3.5&quot; bays and one lower 5.25&quot; bay, and the TL/3 has a high-density floppy drive controller for 1.44 MB drives, though it comes with a double-density 3.5&quot; 720 KB drive.

As the processors on the TL-series are socketed, it is possible to install 386SX or Cyrix 486SLC-based processor upgrades, though the benefit of installing more advanced processors is limited beyond merely providing a speed increase due to the computers&#x27; XT-based architecture, and their resulting inability to access extended memory above 1 MB.

===Tandy 1000 RL-series and RSX===

The Tandy 1000 RL/RLX/RSX are slim-line desktop home computers. They have a much more compact case, with at least 512 KB of memory pre-installed, smaller PS/2-style keyboard and mouse ports, and at least one ISA expansion slot. The RL-series and RSX include provisions for an internal hard disk drive, depending on the model: the RL-series features a built-in XT-IDE hard drive interface, while the RSX features an AT-compatible IDE interface. The keyboard connectors of the RL-series, while similar to and mechanically compatible with PS/2-style connectors, are not fully compatible with typical PS/2 keyboards, as the keyboard uses the XT keyboard protocol. The RSX, however, incorporates the AT keyboard protocol, making it the first 1000-series system to offer more complete compatibility with typical PS/2 keyboards, and AT keyboards using an adapter.

====1000 RL and RL/HD====
The RL and RL/HD features a surface-mounted 8086 processor, 512 KB of RAM (expandable to 768 KB to provide 128 KB for video and 640 KB conventional memory), a DB-25 unidirectional parallel port instead of the edge-connector ports, and the SL&#x27;s enhanced graphics and sound. A single half-size 8-bit expansion slot is available. The RL/HD has a battery-backed real-time clock chip to store date and time information. The RL lacks this and requires a plug-in Smartwatch chip. These models also have MS-DOS and a portion of DeskMate in ROM, and can therefore boot much faster than many other computers on the market. The RL/HD comes with a 20MB drive preinstalled.

====1000 RLX====

The RLX is the &#x27;mid-range&#x27; offering of the RL line. It has a 10 MHz 286 (surface-mounted) and 512 KB of RAM, and unlike other 286-based Tandy 1000 models, it supports 384 KB of extended memory when RAM is expanded to the maximum 1 MB. However, it is not a full AT-class machine, as it still has an 8-bit ISA bus (as with the RL, one half-size expansion slot) and only 8 IRQs and 4 DMA channels. While the three-voice sound chip and DAC are still present, Tandy video was dropped in favor of an AcuMos VGA controller offering 256 KB of video memory and standard VGA graphics resolutions. The parallel port is bidirectional, a first for the Tandy 1000 series. The RLX has one 1.44 MB 3.5&quot; floppy drive; an empty drive bay can host a second such drive. The hard disk RLX/HD comes with a 20 MB hard disk and 1 MB RAM preinstalled. The hard disk occupies the empty drive bay, so this version supports only a single floppy drive.

====1000 RSX====
A more upscale offering, the RSX offers a 25 MHz 80386SX processor, 1 MB RAM, two 16-bit ISA slots, AcuMos SVGA video, a bidirectional parallel port, and standard PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports. It is a full 386-class PC and can run Microsoft Windows 3.x. Two sockets for SIMM memory cards are available. Only 1 MB or 4 MB SIMMs of the 9-chip type are supported, and if two are installed they have to be of like capacity. With two 4 MB SIMMs installed, the 1000 RSX can be expanded to 9 MB RAM without using an ISA slot. The RSX/HD variant comes with a 52 MB hard drive using an AT-compatible IDE interface; replacement hard drives up to 504 MB can be substituted. Because of the slimline case, only one hard drive can be installed alongside the 1.44 MB 3.5&quot; floppy drive.

The motherboard has a socket for the 80387SX math coprocessor. The RSX still retains the Tandy 1000 3-voice sound hardware and DAC, though the I/O address for the 3-voice sound chip was moved, rendering many games compatible with it unable to play music unless modified. The DAC can be used to emulate the Covox Speech Thing via MS-DOS device drivers for limited sound support. This works with &quot;Chuck Yeager&#x27;s Air Combat&quot;.

Windows 3.xx sound device drivers are available that work in Windows 95 (with full 9MB RAM) on Tandy 1000 RSX.
The ACUMOS VGA graphics can be software-updated with Cirrus Logic BIOS (via MS-DOS driver) to allow VESA/SVGA to function in Windows 95, as the Windows 3.xx Tandy VGA drivers are insufficient for Windows 95.

==Selected Tandy 1000-enhanced software==

Major software publishers and makers of game and educational software, such as Sierra and Broderbund, offered software titles that support Tandy&#x27;s 16-color graphics, 3-voice sound, and other Tandy-specific hardware features. These enhancements offer a superior graphics and sound experience for Tandy 1000 owners over CGA graphics or PC speaker sound widely used on most DOS PCs. Software that supported Tandy&#x27;s graphics are typically labelled on the package as Tandy 1000/PCjr compatible.

Although the Tandy 1000 can run most DOS software, the below programs are known to specifically support Tandy 1000 enhanced features. These programs require DOS to run. Tandy shipped its own version of DOS. The 1000 uses the main memory for graphics, so most programs require 640k or 768k to run. The enhanced graphics and sound often tax the processor, so an 80286 processor or faster is often recommended for best results.

There are also games and educational software that supports second-generation Tandy 1000 graphics and sound, which offers 640 by 200 by 16 colors, and 8-bit DACs, found only on the 1000 SL/TL series. Examples of such software include &quot;Mario Teaches Typing&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist&quot;, and &quot;Sargon&quot;.

<doc id="39108" wikidata="Q4354672" url="?curid=39108" title="McLean Hospital">
<text>McLean Hospital () (formerly known as Somerville Asylum and Charlestown Asylum) is a psychiatric hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts. McLean maintains the world&#x27;s largest neuroscientific and psychiatric research program in a private hospital. It is the largest psychiatric facility of Harvard Medical School, an affiliate of Massachusetts General Hospital, and part of Mass General Brigham, which also includes Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital.

== History ==
McLean was founded in 1811 in a section of Charlestown, Massachusetts that is now a part of Somerville, Massachusetts. Originally named Asylum for the Insane, it was the first institution organized by a group of prominent Bostonians who were concerned about homeless mentally ill persons &quot;abounding on the streets and by-ways in and about Boston&quot;. The effort was organized by Rev. John Bartlett, chaplain of the Boston Almshouse. The hospital was built around a Charles Bulfinch mansion, which became the hospital&#x27;s administrative building; most of the other hospital buildings were completed by 1818.

The institution was later given the name The McLean Asylum for the Insane in honor of one of its earliest benefactors, John McLean, who granted enough money to build several such hospitals. A portrait of McLean now hangs in the present Administration Building, along with other paintings that were once displayed in the original hospital. In 1892, the facility was renamed McLean Hospital in recognition of broader views on the treatment of mental illness.

In 1895 the campus moved to Waverley Oaks Hill in Belmont, Massachusetts. Joseph Curtis (civil engineer) and Frederick Law Olmsted (the renowned landscape architect who also conceptualized the Emerald Necklace public spaces of Boston, New York&#x27;s Central Park, and Hartford&#x27;s Institute of Living) were consulted on the selection of the hospital site. The move was necessitated by changes in Charlestown, including new rail lines and other distracting development. Olmsted himself was eventually treated at McLean, but there is no evidence that he was responsible for the design of the grounds. Once hospital construction began, Curtis was hired by the hospital, and supervised the landscape work for many years.

In the 1990s, facing falling revenue in a changing health care industry, the hospital drafted a plan to sell a portion of its grounds for development in the Town of Belmont. The proposed sale of the land caused a divisive and somewhat baroque political debate in the town during the late 1990s. Ultimately a plan to preserve some of Olmsted&#x27;s original open space and to allow the town to develop mixed residential and commercial real estate prevailed over a plan to create only high-end residential development. The deal was finalized in 2005, and land development was well under way by the end of the year. Most of the Belmont campus (more than ) had been listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

In 2006, Irene Jakab, a psychiatrist and humanist at McLean who had achieved prominence for her use of art therapy in the diagnosis and treatment of learning disabilities and mental illness, was awarded the title of honorary staff psychiatrist by the hospital in recognition of her forty years of service, after having previously been honored by the hospital with the creation of an annual award bearing her name.

==Current work==
McLean is known widely for its treatment of adolescents, most specifically its treatment of borderline personality disorder using dialectical behavioral therapy developed by Marsha M. Linehan.

, McLean is led by Scott L. Rauch, President and Psychiatrist in Chief, who is known for his innovative work using brain imaging methods to study psychiatric dysfunction.

As one of the teaching hospitals of Harvard Medical School, McLean is differentiated from its New England peers (such as The Institute of Living and the Brattleboro Retreat) by its combination of teaching, treatment, and research; most other facilities focus on only one of these priorities. It is home to the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center, the largest &quot;brain bank&quot; collection of research specimens in the world. The hospital developed and implemented national health screening methods for alcohol, depression, and memory disorders. The Cole Resource Center, a mental health consumer resource and advocacy center, is located at the hospital.

== Additional Locations ==
In addition to the main Belmont campus, there are four additional locations. The Arlington, Cambridge, and SouthEast (in Middleboro) provide outpatient services, and the SouthEast at Oak Street (in Middleboro) provides inpatient services. Note that the Arlington and Cambridge offices only provide child and adolescent services, while the SouthEast provide services to all ages. 

== Rankings ==

* McLean Hospital is ranked 1st among all psychiatric hospitals in the country according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.
* In 2017, McLean ranked among the top 20 independent hospitals worldwide receiving National Institutes of Health grant support.

==Former patients==
Mathematician John Nash; musicians James Taylor, and Ray Charles; poets Sylvia Plath, Robert Lowell and Anne Sexton; Massachusetts politician and Civil War general Nathaniel P. Banks; authors Susanna Kaysen and David Foster Wallace; and criminal Michelle Carter have been treated at McLean Hospital.

==In books and media==
A story about the facility from 1853 describes the work underway and provides some statistics about the capacity and treatment outcomes.

One popular and anecdotal history of McLean is Alex Beam&#x27;s &quot;Gracefully Insane: Life and Death Inside America&#x27;s Premier Mental Hospital&quot;. More-factual and scholarly accounts of the history are recorded in the Little and Sutton books listed in &quot;Further reading&quot;.

Memoirs of time spent within McLean&#x27;s walls include Sylvia Plath&#x27;s novel &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;, and Susanna Kaysen&#x27;s &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;, which was made into a film of the same name starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie. Samuel Shem&#x27;s roman à clef &quot;Mount Misery&quot; tells a story inspired at least in part by the author&#x27;s experiences at McLean. The 1994 &quot;Under Observation: Life Inside A Mental Hospital&quot; by Lisa Berger and Alexander Vuckovic uses some fictional techniques (composite characters, etc.) to describe some of the typical events at McLean. James Taylor&#x27;s song &quot;Knockin&#x27; &#x27;Round the Zoo&quot; recalls his stay at McLean as a teenager. &quot;Poems of Boston and Just Beyond: From the Back Bay to the Back Ward&quot; by Doug Holder are based on his more than three decades working there, and are archived at the poetry room at the Lamont Library at Harvard University.

<text>The term road bicycle is used to describe bicycles built for traveling at speed on paved roads. Some sources use the term to mean racing bicycle. Other sources specifically exclude racing bicycles from the definition, using the term to mean a bicycle of a similar style but built more for endurance and less the fast bursts of speed desired in a racing bicycle; as such, they usually have more gear combinations and fewer hi-tech racing features. Certain of these bicycles have been referred to as &#x27;sportive&#x27; bicycles to distinguish them from racing bicycles.

Compared to other styles of bicycle, road bicycles share common features:

* The tires are narrow, high-pressure, and smooth to decrease rolling resistance
* The handlebars are bent (&quot;dropped&quot;) to allow the rider position to be leaned forward and downward, which reduces the forward vertical cross-sectional area and thus highly reduces the air resistance
* They usually use derailleur gears; however, single-speed and fixed-gear varieties exist (which often are used city-wide, due to simple maintenance from their simple designs).
* They either use disc brakes or rim brakes (although there might be technical differences, for example, road bike calliper brakes use shorter and wider pads than mountain bike cantilevers)
* The bicycle is of lightweight construction using materials such as aluminium alloys or carbon fibre.
* They usually use clipless pedals and special shoes in contrast to flat pedals, usually installed on mountain bikes.

The term &quot;road bicycle&quot; can also describe any type of bike used primarily on paved roads, in contrast to bikes primarily intended for off-road use, such as mountain bikes. Several variations of road bikes include:

* Touring bicycles are designed for bicycle touring: they are robust, comfortable, and capable of carrying heavy loads
* Hybrid bicycles are designed for a variety of recreational and utility purposes. While primarily intended for use on pavement, they may also be used on relatively smooth unpaved paths or trails.
* Utility bicycles are designed for utility cycling: are a traditional bicycle for commuting, shopping and running errands in towns and cities.
** A roadster is a specific form of utility bicycle developed in the UK.
* Recumbent bicycles are designed for a variety of recreational and utility purposes, but are characterised by the reclined riding position in which the cyclist is seated.
* Vintage road bicycles, also known as classic lightweight bicycles, are generally older bicycles with frames which are manufactured using steel tubing and lugs. Certain examples of this bicycle type have become collectors&#x27; items, with potential values of several thousand dollars. Other cyclists prefer this type of bicycle to those manufactured using modern techniques because they are &quot;practical, versatile, durable, repairable, and timeless, regardless of current popular trends.&quot;
* An endurance bike, also known as a sportive bike, is a type of road bicycle designed specifically for long-distance riding and comfort. Unlike traditional road racing bikes, endurance bikes have a more relaxed geometry that allows for a more upright riding position.
* A flat bar road bike, also called a fitness bike, is a relatively new style of bicycle. It is simply a road bike fitted with a flat handlebar and MTB-style shifters and brake levers. This combination provides a light, fast bike with a more upright riding position that is more comfortable and gives a better view in traffic. Flat bar road bike are commonly used for commuting, urban and fitness riding.

<doc id="39113" wikidata="Q622424" url="?curid=39113" title="Tesla coil">
<text>A Tesla coil is an electrical resonant transformer circuit designed by inventor Nikola Tesla in 1891. It is used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high-frequency alternating-current electricity. Tesla experimented with a number of different configurations consisting of two, or sometimes three, coupled resonant electric circuits.

Tesla used these circuits to conduct innovative experiments in electrical lighting, phosphorescence, X-ray generation, high-frequency alternating current phenomena, electrotherapy, and the transmission of electrical energy without wires. Tesla coil circuits were used commercially in spark-gap radio transmitters for wireless telegraphy until the 1920s, and in medical equipment such as electrotherapy and violet ray devices. Today, their main usage is for entertainment and educational displays, although small coils are still used as leak detectors for high-vacuum systems.

Originally, Tesla coils used fixed spark gaps or rotary spark gaps to provide intermittent excitation of the resonant circuit; more recently, electronic devices are used to provide the switching action required.

==Operation==

A Tesla coil is a radio frequency oscillator that drives an air-core double-tuned resonant transformer to produce high voltages at low currents. Tesla&#x27;s original circuits and most modern coils use a simple spark gap to excite oscillations in the tuned transformer. More sophisticated designs use transistor or thyristor switches or vacuum tube electronic oscillators to drive the resonant transformer.

Tesla coils can produce output voltages from 50 kilovolts to several million volts for large coils. The alternating current output is in the low radio frequency range, usually between 50 kHz and 1 MHz. Although some oscillator-driven coils generate a continuous alternating current, most Tesla coils have a pulsed output; the high voltage consists of a rapid string of pulses of radio frequency alternating current.

The common spark-excited Tesla coil circuit, shown below, consists of these components:
* A high-voltage supply transformer &quot;(T)&quot;, to step the AC mains voltage up to a high enough voltage to jump the spark gap. Typical voltages are between 5 and 30 kilovolts (kV).
* A capacitor &quot;(C1)&quot; that forms a tuned circuit with the primary winding &quot;L1&quot; of the Tesla transformer
* A spark gap &quot;(SG)&quot; that acts as a switch in the primary circuit
* The Tesla coil &quot;(L1, L2)&quot;, an air-core double-tuned resonant transformer, which generates the high output voltage.
* Optionally, a capacitive electrode (top load) &quot;(E)&quot; in the form of a smooth metal sphere or torus attached to the secondary terminal of the coil. Its large surface area suppresses premature air breakdown and arc discharges, increasing the Q factor and output voltage.

===Resonant transformer===

The specialized transformer used in the Tesla coil circuit &quot;(L1,L2)&quot;, called a resonant transformer, oscillation transformer, or radio-frequency (RF) transformer, functions differently from ordinary transformers used in AC power circuits. While an ordinary transformer is designed to &quot;transfer&quot; energy efficiently from primary to secondary winding, the resonant transformer is also designed to &quot;temporarily store&quot; electrical energy. Each winding has a capacitance across it and functions as an LC circuit (resonant circuit, tuned circuit), storing oscillating electrical energy, analogously to the way a tuning fork stores vibrational mechanical energy. The primary coil &quot;(L1)&quot; consisting of a relatively few turns of heavy copper wire or tubing, is connected to a capacitor &quot;(C1)&quot; through the spark gap &quot;(SG)&quot;. The secondary coil &quot;(L2)&quot; consists of many turns (hundreds to thousands) of fine wire on a hollow cylindrical form inside the primary. The secondary is not connected to an actual capacitor, but it also functions as an LC circuit, the inductance of &quot;(L2)&quot; resonates with stray capacitance &quot;(C2)&quot;, the sum of the stray parasitic capacitance between the windings of the coil, and the capacitance of the toroidal metal electrode attached to the high-voltage terminal. The primary and secondary circuits are tuned so that they have the same resonant frequency, so they exchange energy, acting like a coupled oscillator; during each spark the stored energy rapidly oscillates back and forth between the primary and secondary.

The peculiar design of the coil is dictated by the need to achieve low resistive energy losses (high Q factor) at high frequencies, which results in the largest secondary voltages:

* Ordinary power transformers have an iron core to increase the magnetic coupling between the coils. However at high frequencies an iron core causes energy losses due to eddy currents and hysteresis, so it is not used in the Tesla coil.
* Ordinary transformers are designed to be &quot;tightly coupled&quot;. Both the primary and secondary are wound tightly around the iron core. Due to the iron core and close proximity of the windings, they have a high mutual inductance &quot;(M)&quot;, the coupling coefficient is close to unity 0.95 – 1.0, which means almost all the magnetic field of the primary winding passes through the secondary. The Tesla transformer in contrast is &quot;loosely coupled&quot;, the primary winding is larger in diameter and spaced apart from the secondary, so the mutual inductance is lower and the coupling coefficient is only 0.05 to 0.2. This means that only 5% to 20% of the magnetic field of the primary coil passes through the secondary when it is open circuited. The loose coupling slows the exchange of energy between the primary and secondary coils, which allows the oscillating energy to stay in the secondary circuit longer before it returns to the primary and begins dissipating in the spark.
* Each winding is also limited to a single layer of wire, which reduces proximity effect losses. The primary carries very high currents. Since high-frequency current mostly flows on the surface of conductors due to skin effect, it is often made of copper tubing or strip with a large surface area to reduce resistance, and its turns are spaced apart, which reduces proximity effect losses and arcing between turns.

The output circuit can have two forms:

* &quot;Unipolar&quot;: One end of the secondary winding is connected to a single high-voltage terminal, the other end is grounded. This type is used in modern coils designed for entertainment. The primary winding is located near the bottom, low potential end of the secondary, to minimize arcs between the windings. Since the ground (Earth) serves as the return path for the high voltage, streamer arcs from the terminal tend to jump to any nearby grounded object.
* &quot;Bipolar&quot;: Neither end of the secondary winding is grounded, and both are brought out to high-voltage terminals. The primary winding is located at the center of the secondary coil, equidistant between the two high potential terminals, to discourage arcing.

===Operation cycle===
The circuit operates in a rapidly repeating cycle in which the supply transformer &quot;(T)&quot; charges the primary capacitor &quot;(C1)&quot; up, which then discharges in a spark through the spark gap, creating a brief pulse of oscillating current in the primary circuit which excites a high oscillating voltage across the secondary:
# Current from the supply transformer &quot;(T)&quot; charges the capacitor &quot;(C1)&quot; to a high voltage.
# When the voltage across the capacitor reaches the breakdown voltage of the spark gap &quot;(SG)&quot; a spark starts, reducing the spark gap resistance to a very low value. This completes the primary circuit and current from the capacitor flows through the primary coil &quot;(L1)&quot;. The current flows rapidly back and forth between the plates of the capacitor through the coil, generating radio frequency oscillating current in the primary circuit at the circuit&#x27;s resonant frequency.
# The oscillating magnetic field of the primary winding induces an oscillating current in the secondary winding &quot;(L2)&quot;, by Faraday&#x27;s law of induction. Over a number of cycles, the energy in the primary circuit is transferred to the secondary. The total energy in the tuned circuits is limited to the energy originally stored in the capacitor &quot;C1&quot;, so as the oscillating voltage in the secondary increases in amplitude (&quot;ring up&quot;) the oscillations in the primary decrease to zero. Although the ends of the secondary coil are open, it also acts as a tuned circuit due to the capacitance &quot;(C2)&quot;, the sum of the parasitic capacitance between the turns of the coil plus the capacitance of the toroid electrode &quot;E&quot;. Current flows rapidly back and forth through the secondary coil between its ends. Because of the small capacitance, the oscillating voltage across the secondary coil which appears on the output terminal is much larger than the primary voltage.
# The secondary current creates a magnetic field that induces voltage back in the primary coil, and over a number of additional cycles the energy is transferred back to the primary, causing the oscillating voltage in the secondary to decrease (&quot;ring down&quot;). This process repeats, the energy shifting rapidly back and forth between the primary and secondary tuned circuits. The oscillating currents in the primary and secondary gradually die out due to energy dissipated as heat in the spark gap and resistance of the coil.
# When the current through the spark gap is no longer sufficient to keep the air in the gap ionized, the spark stops (&quot;quenches&quot;), terminating the current in the primary circuit. The oscillating current in the secondary may continue for some time.
# The current from the supply transformer begins charging the capacitor &quot;C1&quot; again and the cycle repeats.

This entire cycle takes place very rapidly, the oscillations dying out in a time of the order of a millisecond. Each spark across the spark gap produces a pulse of damped sinusoidal high voltage at the output terminal of the coil. Each pulse dies out before the next spark occurs, so the coil generates a string of damped waves, not a continuous sinusoidal voltage. The high voltage from the supply transformer that charges the capacitor is a 50 or 60 Hz sine wave. Depending on how the spark gap is set, usually one or two sparks occur at the peak of each half-cycle of the mains current, so there are more than a hundred sparks per second. Thus the spark at the spark gap appears continuous, as do the high-voltage streamers from the top of the coil.

The supply transformer &quot;(T)&quot; secondary winding is connected across the primary tuned circuit. It might seem that the transformer would be a leakage path for the RF current, damping the oscillations. However its large inductance gives it a very high impedance at the resonant frequency, so it acts as an open circuit to the oscillating current. If the supply transformer has inadequate short-circuit inductance, radio frequency chokes are placed in its secondary leads to block the RF current.

===Oscillation frequency===
To produce the largest output voltage, the primary and secondary tuned circuits are adjusted to resonance with each other. The resonant frequencies of the primary and secondary circuits, formula_1 and formula_2, are determined by the inductance and capacitance in each circuit:
:formula_3

Generally the secondary is not adjustable, so the primary circuit is tuned, usually by a moveable tap on the primary coil L1, until it resonates at the same frequency as the secondary:
:formula_4

Thus the condition for resonance between primary and secondary is:
:formula_5

The resonant frequency of Tesla coils is in the low radio frequency (RF) range, usually between 50 kHz and 1 MHz. However, because of the impulsive nature of the spark they produce broadband radio noise, and without shielding can be a significant source of RFI, interfering with nearby radio and television reception.

===Output voltage===
In a resonant transformer the high voltage is produced by resonance; the output voltage is not proportional to the turns ratio, as in an ordinary transformer. It can be calculated approximately from conservation of energy. At the beginning of the cycle, when the spark starts, all of the energy in the primary circuit formula_6 is stored in the primary capacitor formula_7. If formula_8 is the voltage at which the spark gap breaks down, which is usually close to the peak output voltage of the supply transformer &quot;T&quot;, this energy is
:formula_9

During the &quot;ring up&quot; this energy is transferred to the secondary circuit. Although some is lost as heat in the spark and other resistances, in modern coils, over 85% of the energy ends up in the secondary. At the peak (formula_10) of the secondary sinusoidal voltage waveform, all the energy in the secondary formula_11 is stored in the capacitance formula_12 between the ends of the secondary coil
:formula_13
Assuming no energy losses, formula_14. Substituting into this equation and simplifying, the peak secondary voltage is

The second formula above is derived from the first using the resonance condition formula_15. Since the capacitance of the secondary coil is very small compared to the primary capacitor, the primary voltage is stepped up to a high value.

The above peak voltage is only achieved in coils in which air discharges do not occur; in coils which produce sparks, like entertainment coils, the peak voltage on the terminal is limited to the voltage at which the air breaks down and becomes conductive. As the output voltage increases during each voltage pulse, it reaches the point where the air next to the high-voltage terminal ionizes and corona, brush discharges, and streamer arcs break out from the terminal. This happens when the electric field strength exceeds the dielectric strength of the air, about 30 kV per centimeter. Since the electric field is greatest at sharp points and edges, air discharges start at these points on the high-voltage terminal. The voltage on the high-voltage terminal cannot increase above the air breakdown voltage, because additional electric charge pumped into the terminal from the secondary winding just escapes into the air. The output voltage of open-air Tesla coils is limited to a few million volts by air breakdown, but higher voltages can be achieved by coils immersed in pressurized tanks of insulating oil.

===Top load or &quot;toroid&quot; electrode===
Most Tesla coil designs have a smooth spherical- or toroidal-shaped metal electrode on the high-voltage terminal. The electrode serves as one plate of a capacitor, with the Earth as the other plate, forming the tuned circuit with the secondary winding. Although the &quot;toroid&quot; increases the secondary capacitance, which tends to reduce the peak voltage, its main effect is that its large-diameter curved surface reduces the potential gradient (electric field) at the high-voltage terminal; it functions similarly to a corona ring, increasing the voltage threshold at which air discharges such as corona and brush discharges occur. Suppressing premature air breakdown and energy loss allows the voltage to build to higher values on the peaks of the waveform, creating longer, more spectacular streamers when air discharges finally occur.

If the top electrode is large and smooth enough, the electric field at its surface may never get high enough even at the peak voltage to cause air breakdown, and air discharges will not occur. Some entertainment coils have a sharp &quot;spark point&quot; projecting from the torus to start discharges.

==Types==
The term &quot;Tesla coil&quot; is applied to a number of high-voltage resonant transformer circuits.

===Excitation===
Tesla coil circuits can be classified by the type of &quot;excitation&quot; they use, what type of circuit is used to apply current to the primary winding of the resonant transformer:
* Spark-excited or Spark Gap Tesla Coil (SGTC): This type uses a spark gap to close the primary circuit, discharging a capacitor through the resonant transformer, exciting oscillations. Spark gaps have disadvantages due to the high primary currents they must handle. They produce a very loud noise while operating, noxious ozone gas, and high temperatures which may require a cooling system. The energy dissipated in the spark also reduces the Q factor and the output voltage. Tesla&#x27;s coils were all spark-excited.
** Static spark gap: This is the most common type, which was described in detail in the previous section. It is used in most entertainment coils. An AC voltage from a high-voltage supply transformer charges a capacitor, which discharges through the spark gap. The spark rate is not adjustable but is determined by the 50 or 60 Hz line frequency. Multiple sparks may occur on each half-cycle, so the pulses of output voltage may not be equally-spaced.
** Static triggered spark gap: Commercial and industrial circuits often apply a DC voltage from a power supply to charge the capacitor, and use high-voltage pulses generated by an oscillator applied to a triggering electrode to trigger the spark. This allows control of the spark rate and exciting voltage. Commercial spark gaps are often enclosed in an insulating gas atmosphere such as sulfur hexafluoride, reducing the length and thus the energy loss in the spark.
** Rotary spark gap: These use a spark gap consisting of electrodes around the periphery of a wheel rotated at high speed by a motor, which create sparks when they pass by a stationary electrode. Tesla used this type on his big coils, and they are used today on large entertainment coils. The rapid separation speed of the electrodes quenches the spark quickly, allowing &quot;first notch&quot; quenching, making possible higher voltages. The wheel is usually driven by a synchronous motor, so the sparks are synchronized with the AC line frequency, the spark occurring at the same point on the AC waveform on each cycle, so the primary pulses are repeatable.
* Switched or Solid State Tesla Coil (SSTC): These use power semiconductor devices, usually thyristors or transistors such as MOSFETs or IGBTs, triggered by a solid state oscillator circuit to switch pulses of voltage from a DC power supply through the primary winding. They provide pulsed excitation without the disadvantages of a spark gap: the loud noise, high temperatures, and poor efficiency. The voltage, frequency, and excitation waveform can be finely controllable. SSTCs are used in most commercial, industrial, and research applications as well as higher quality entertainment coils.
** Single resonant solid state Tesla coil (SRSSTC): In this circuit the primary does not have a resonant capacitor, only the secondary does; so it is a single tuned circuit, not a double-tuned circuit. The current to the primary from the switching transistors excites resonance in the secondary tuned circuit. Single tuned SSTCs are simpler, but the single resonant circuit usually has a lower Q factor and so stores less energy and produces lower voltages than double resonant circuits, other things being equal.
** Dual Resonant Solid State Tesla Coil (DRSSTC): The circuit is similar to the double tuned spark excited circuit, except in place of the AC supply transformer (&quot;T&quot;) in the primary circuit a DC power supply charges the capacitor, and in place of the spark gap semiconductor switches complete the circuit between the capacitor and the primary coil.

** Singing Tesla coil or musical Tesla coil: This is not a separate type of excitation, but a modification to the solid state primary circuit to create a Tesla coil which can be played like a musical instrument, with its high-voltage discharges reproducing simple musical tones. The drive voltage pulses applied to the primary are modulated at an audio rate by a solid state &quot;interrupter&quot; circuit, causing the arc discharge from the high-voltage terminal to emit sounds. Only tones and simple chords have been produced so far; the coil cannot function as a loudspeaker, reproducing complex music or voice sounds. The sound output is controlled by a keyboard or MIDI file applied to the circuit through a MIDI interface. Two modulation techniques have been used: AM (amplitude modulation of the exciting voltage) and PFM (pulse-frequency modulation). These are mainly built as novelties for entertainment.
* Continuous wave: In these the transformer is driven by a feedback oscillator, which applies a pulse of current to the primary winding each cycle of the RF current, exciting a continuous oscillation. The primary tuned circuit serves as the tank circuit of the oscillator, and the circuit resembles a radio transmitter. Unlike the previous circuits which generate a pulsed output, they generate a continuous sine wave output. Power vacuum tubes are often used as active devices instead of transistors because they are more robust and tolerant of overloads. In general, continuous excitation produces lower output voltages from a given input power than pulsed excitation.

===Number of coils===
Tesla circuits can also be classified by how many resonant coils (inductors) they contain:
* Two coil or double-resonant circuits: Virtually all present Tesla coils use the two coil resonant transformer, consisting of a primary winding to which current pulses are applied, and a secondary winding that produces the high voltage, invented by Tesla in 1891. The term &quot;Tesla coil&quot; normally refers to these circuits.
* Three coil, triple-resonant, or magnifier circuits: These are circuits with three coils, based on Tesla&#x27;s &quot;magnifying transmitter&quot; circuit which he began experimenting with sometime before 1898 and installed in his Colorado Springs lab 1899–1900, and patented in 1902. They consist of a two coil air-core step-up transformer similar to the Tesla transformer, with the secondary connected to a third coil not magnetically coupled to the others, called the &quot;extra&quot; or &quot;resonator&quot; coil, which is series-fed and resonates with its own capacitance. The output is taken from the free end of this coil. The presence of three energy-storing tank circuits gives this circuit more complicated resonant behavior. It is the subject of research, but has been used in few practical applications.

==History==

Electrical oscillation and resonant air-core transformer circuits had been explored before Tesla. Resonant circuits using Leyden jars were invented beginning in 1826 by Felix Savary, Joseph Henry, William Thomson, and Oliver Lodge. and Henry Rowland built a resonant transformer in 1889. Elihu Thomson invented the Tesla coil circuit independently at the same time Tesla did. Tesla patented his Tesla coil circuit April 25, 1891. and first publicly demonstrated it May 20, 1891, in his lecture &quot;Experiments with Alternate Currents of Very High Frequency and Their Application to Methods of Artificial Illumination&quot; before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers at Columbia College, New York. Although Tesla patented many similar circuits during this period, this was the first that contained all the elements of the Tesla coil: high-voltage primary transformer, capacitor, spark gap, and air core &quot;oscillation transformer&quot;.

==Modern-day Tesla coils==

Modern high-voltage enthusiasts usually build Tesla coils similar to some of Tesla&#x27;s &quot;later&quot; 2-coil air-core designs. These typically consist of a primary tank circuit, a series LC (inductance-capacitance) circuit composed of a high-voltage capacitor, spark gap, and primary coil; and the secondary LC circuit, a series-resonant circuit consisting of the secondary coil plus a terminal capacitance or &quot;top load&quot;. In Tesla&#x27;s more advanced (magnifier) design, a third coil is added. The secondary LC circuit is composed of a tightly coupled air-core transformer secondary coil driving the bottom of a separate third coil helical resonator. Modern 2-coil systems use a single secondary coil. The top of the secondary is then connected to a topload terminal, which forms one &#x27;plate&#x27; of a capacitor, the other &#x27;plate&#x27; being the earth (or &quot;ground&quot;). The primary LC circuit is tuned so that it resonates at the same frequency as the secondary LC circuit. The primary and secondary coils are magnetically coupled, creating a dual-tuned resonant air-core transformer. Earlier oil-insulated Tesla coils needed large and long insulators at their high-voltage terminals to prevent discharge in air. Later Tesla coils spread their electric fields over larger distances to prevent high electrical stresses in the first place, thereby allowing operation in free air. Most modern Tesla coils also use toroid-shaped output terminals. These are often fabricated from spun metal or flexible aluminum ducting. The toroidal shape helps to control the high electric field near the top of the secondary by directing sparks outward and away from the primary and secondary windings.

A more complex version of a Tesla coil, termed a &quot;magnifier&quot; by Tesla, uses a more tightly coupled air-core resonance &quot;driver&quot; transformer (or &quot;master oscillator&quot;) and a smaller, remotely located output coil (called the &quot;extra coil&quot; or simply the resonator) that has a large number of turns on a relatively small coil form. The bottom of the driver&#x27;s secondary winding is connected to ground. The opposite end is connected to the bottom of the extra coil through an insulated conductor that is sometimes called the transmission line. Since the transmission line operates at relatively high RF voltages, it is typically made of 1&quot; diameter metal tubing to reduce corona losses. Since the third coil is located some distance away from the driver, it is not magnetically coupled to it. RF energy is instead directly coupled from the output of the driver into the bottom of the third coil, causing it to &quot;ring up&quot; to very high voltages. The combination of the two-coil driver and third coil resonator adds another degree of freedom to the system, making tuning considerably more complex than that of a 2-coil system. The transient response for multiple resonance networks (of which the Tesla magnifier is a sub-set) has only recently been solved. It is now known that a variety of useful tuning &quot;modes&quot; are available, and in most operating modes the extra coil will ring at a different frequency than the master oscillator.

===Primary switching===

Modern transistor or vacuum tube Tesla coils do not use a primary spark gap. Instead, the transistor(s) or vacuum tube(s) provide the switching or amplifying function necessary to generate RF power for the primary circuit. Solid-state Tesla coils use the lowest primary operating voltage, typically between 155 and 800 volts, and drive the primary winding using either a single, half-bridge, or full-bridge arrangement of transistors, MOSFETs, or IGBTs to switch the primary current. Vacuum tube coils typically operate with plate voltages between 1500 and 6000 volts, while most spark gap coils operate with primary voltages of 6,000 to 25,000 volts. The primary winding of a traditional transistor Tesla coil is wound around only the bottom portion of the secondary coil. This configuration illustrates operation of the secondary as a pumped resonator. The primary &#x27;induces&#x27; alternating voltage into the bottom-most portion of the secondary, providing regular &#x27;pushes&#x27; (similar to providing properly timed pushes to a playground swing). Additional energy is transferred from the primary to the secondary inductance and top-load capacitance during each &quot;push&quot;, and secondary output voltage builds (called &#x27;ring-up&#x27;). An electronic feedback circuit is usually used to adaptively synchronize the primary oscillator to the growing resonance in the secondary, and this is the only tuning consideration beyond the initial choice of a reasonable top-load.

In a dual resonant solid-state Tesla coil (DRSSTC), the electronic switching of the solid-state Tesla coil is combined with the resonant primary circuit of a spark-gap Tesla coil. The resonant primary circuit is formed by connecting a capacitor in series with the primary winding of the coil, so that the combination forms a series tank circuit with a resonant frequency near that of the secondary circuit. Because of the additional resonant circuit, one manual and one adaptive tuning adjustment are necessary. Also, an interrupter is usually used to reduce the duty cycle of the switching bridge, to improve peak power capabilities; similarly, IGBTs are more popular in this application than bipolar junction transistors or MOSFETs, due to their superior power handling characteristics. A current-limiting circuit is usually used to limit maximum primary tank current (which must be switched by the IGBTs) to a safe level. Performance of a DRSSTC can be comparable to a medium-power spark-gap Tesla coil, and efficiency (as measured by spark length versus input power) can be significantly greater than a spark-gap Tesla coil operating at the same input power.

==Practical aspects of design==

===High voltage production===
A large Tesla coil of more modern design often operates at very high peak power levels, up to many megawatts (millions of watts, equivalent to thousands of horsepower). It is therefore adjusted and operated carefully, not only for efficiency and economy, but also for safety. If, due to improper tuning, the maximum voltage point occurs below the terminal, along the secondary coil, a discharge (spark) may break out and damage or destroy the coil wire, supports, or nearby objects.

Tesla experimented with these, and many other, circuit configurations (see right). The Tesla coil primary winding, spark gap and tank capacitor are connected in series. In each circuit, the AC supply transformer charges the tank capacitor until its voltage is sufficient to break down the spark gap. The gap suddenly fires, allowing the charged tank capacitor to discharge into the primary winding. Once the gap fires, the electrical behavior of either circuit is identical. Experiments have shown that neither circuit offers any marked performance advantage over the other.

However, in the typical circuit, the spark gap&#x27;s short circuiting action prevents high-frequency oscillations from &#x27;backing up&#x27; into the supply transformer. In the alternate circuit, high amplitude high-frequency oscillations that appear across the capacitor also are applied to the supply transformer&#x27;s winding. This can induce corona discharges between turns that weaken and eventually destroy the transformer&#x27;s insulation. Experienced Tesla coil builders almost exclusively use the top circuit, often augmenting it with low pass filters (resistor and capacitor (RC) networks) between the supply transformer and spark gap to help protect the supply transformer. This is especially important when using transformers with fragile high-voltage windings, such as neon sign transformers (NSTs). Regardless of which configuration is used, the HV transformer must be of a type that self-limits its secondary current by means of internal short-circuit inductance. A normal (low Short-circuit inductance) high-voltage transformer must use an external limiter (sometimes called a ballast) to limit current. NSTs are designed to have high Short-circuit inductance to limit their short circuit current to a safe level.

====Tuning====

The primary coil&#x27;s resonant frequency is tuned to that of the secondary, by using low-power oscillations, then increasing the power (and retuning if necessary) until the system operates properly at maximum power. While tuning, a small projection (called a &quot;breakout bump&quot;) is often added to the top terminal in order to stimulate corona and spark discharges (sometimes called streamers) into the surrounding air. Tuning can then be adjusted so as to achieve the longest streamers at a given power level, corresponding to a frequency match between the primary and secondary coil. Capacitive &quot;loading&quot; by the streamers tends to lower the resonant frequency of a Tesla coil operating under full power. A toroidal topload is often preferred to other shapes, such as a sphere. A toroid with a major diameter that is much larger than the secondary diameter provides improved shaping of the electric field at the topload. This provides better protection of the secondary winding (from damaging streamer strikes) than a sphere of similar diameter. And, a toroid permits fairly independent control of topload capacitance versus spark breakout voltage. A toroid&#x27;s capacitance is mainly a function of its major diameter, while the spark breakout voltage is mainly a function of its minor diameter. A grid dip oscillator (GDO) is sometimes used to help facilitate initial tuning and aid in design. The resonant frequency of the secondary can be difficult to determine except by using a GDO or other experimental method, whereas the physical properties of the primary more closely represent lumped approximations of RF tank design. In this schema the secondary is built somewhat arbitrarily in imitation of other successful designs, or entirely so with supplies on hand, its resonant frequency is measured and the primary designed to suit.

====Air discharges====
In coils that produce air discharges, such as those built for entertainment, electrical energy from the secondary and toroid is transferred to the surrounding air as electrical charge, heat, light, and sound. The process is similar to charging or discharging a capacitor, except that a Tesla coil uses AC instead of DC. The current that arises from shifting charges within a capacitor is called a displacement current. Tesla coil discharges are formed as a result of displacement currents as pulses of electrical charge are rapidly transferred between the high-voltage toroid and nearby regions within the air (called space charge regions). Although the space charge regions around the toroid are invisible, they play a profound role in the appearance and location of Tesla coil discharges.

When the spark gap fires, the charged capacitor discharges into the primary winding, causing the primary circuit to oscillate. The oscillating primary current creates an oscillating magnetic field that couples to the secondary winding, transferring energy into the secondary side of the transformer and causing it to oscillate with the toroid capacitance to ground. Energy transfer occurs over a number of cycles, until most of the energy that was originally in the primary side is transferred to the secondary side. The greater the magnetic coupling between windings, the shorter the time required to complete the energy transfer. As energy builds within the oscillating secondary circuit, the amplitude of the toroid&#x27;s RF voltage rapidly increases, and the air surrounding the toroid begins to undergo dielectric breakdown, forming a corona discharge.

As the secondary coil&#x27;s energy (and output voltage) continue to increase, larger pulses of displacement current further ionize and heat the air at the point of initial breakdown. This forms a very electrically conductive &quot;root&quot; of hotter plasma, called a leader, that projects outward from the toroid. The plasma within the leader is considerably hotter than a corona discharge, and is considerably more conductive. In fact, its properties are similar to an electric arc. The leader tapers and branches into thousands of thinner, cooler, hair-like discharges (called streamers). The streamers look like a bluish &#x27;haze&#x27; at the ends of the more luminous leaders. The streamers transfer charge between the leaders and toroid to nearby space charge regions. The displacement currents from countless streamers all feed into the leader, helping to keep it hot and electrically conductive.

The primary break rate of sparking Tesla coils is slow compared to the resonant frequency of the resonator-topload assembly. When the switch closes, energy is transferred from the primary LC circuit to the resonator where the voltage rings up over a short period of time up culminating in the electrical discharge. In a spark gap Tesla coil, the primary-to-secondary energy transfer process happens repetitively at typical pulsing rates of 50–500 times per second, depending on the frequency of the input line voltage. At these rates, previously-formed leader channels do not get a chance to fully cool down between pulses. So, on successive pulses, newer discharges can build upon the hot pathways left by their predecessors. This causes incremental growth of the leader from one pulse to the next, lengthening the entire discharge on each successive pulse. Repetitive pulsing causes the discharges to grow until the average energy available from the Tesla coil during each pulse balances the average energy being lost in the discharges (mostly as heat). At this point, dynamic equilibrium is reached, and the discharges have reached their maximum length for the Tesla coil&#x27;s output power level. The unique combination of a rising high-voltage radio frequency envelope and repetitive pulsing seem to be ideally suited to creating long, branching discharges that are considerably longer than would be otherwise expected by output voltage considerations alone. High-voltage, low-energy discharges create filamentary multibranched discharges which are purplish-blue in colour. High-voltage, high-energy discharges create thicker discharges with fewer branches, are pale and luminous, almost white, and are much longer than low-energy discharges, because of increased ionisation. A strong smell of ozone and nitrogen oxides will occur in the area. The important factors for maximum discharge length appear to be voltage, energy, and still air of low to moderate humidity. There are comparatively few scientific studies about the initiation and growth of pulsed lower-frequency RF discharges, so some aspects of Tesla coil air discharges are not as well understood when compared to DC, power-frequency AC, HV impulse, and lightning discharges.

==Applications==

Today, although small Tesla coils are used as leak detectors in scientific high-vacuum systems and igniters in arc welders, their main use is entertainment and educational displays.

===Education and entertainment===
Tesla coils are displayed as attractions at science museums and electronics fairs, and are used to demonstrate principles of high-frequency electricity in science classes in schools and colleges.

Since they are simple enough for an amateur to make, Tesla coils are a popular student science fair project, and are homemade by a large worldwide community of hobbyists. Builders of Tesla coils as a hobby are called &quot;coilers&quot;. They attend &quot;coiling&quot; conventions where they display their home-made Tesla coils and other high-voltage devices. Low-power Tesla coils are also sometimes used as a high-voltage source for Kirlian photography.

The current world&#x27;s largest Tesla coil is a 130,000-watt unit built by Greg Leyh and Eric Orr, part of a sculpture titled &quot;Electrum&quot; owned by Alan Gibbs and currently residing in a private sculpture park at Kakanui Point near Auckland, New Zealand. Another very large Tesla coil, designed and built by Syd Klinge, is shown every year at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Coachella, California.

Tesla coils can also be used to generate sounds, including music, by modulating the system&#x27;s effective &quot;break rate&quot; (i.e., the rate and duration of high power RF bursts) via MIDI data and a control unit. The actual MIDI data is interpreted by a microcontroller which converts the MIDI data into a PWM output which can be sent to the Tesla coil via a fiber optic interface.An extensive outdoor musical concert has demonstrated using Tesla coils during the Engineering Open House (EOH) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The Icelandic artist Björk used a Tesla coil in her song &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; as the main instrument in the song. The musical group ArcAttack uses modulated Tesla coils and a man in a chain-link suit to play music.

===Vacuum system leak detectors===

Scientists working with high-vacuum systems test for the presence of tiny pin holes in the apparatus (especially a newly blown piece of glassware) using high-voltage discharges produced by a small handheld Tesla coil. When the system is evacuated the high-voltage electrode of the coil is played over the outside of the apparatus. At low pressures, air is more easily ionized and thus conducts electricity better than atmospheric-pressure air. Therefore, the discharge travels through any pin hole immediately below it, producing a corona discharge inside the evacuated space which illuminates the hole, indicating points that need to be annealed or reblown before they can be used in an experiment.

===Teslaphoresis===
In 2016, Rice University scientists used the field of a Tesla coil to remotely align tiny carbon nanotubes into a circuit, a process they dubbed &quot;teslaphoresis&quot;.

==Health issues==

The high-voltage radio frequency (RF) discharges from the output terminal of a Tesla coil pose a unique hazard not found in other high-voltage equipment: when passed through the body, they often do not cause the painful sensation and muscle contraction of electric shock, as lower frequency AC or DC currents do. The nervous system is insensitive to currents with frequencies over 10–20 kHz. It is thought that the reason for this is that a certain minimum number of ions must be driven across a nerve cell&#x27;s membrane by the imposed voltage to trigger the nerve cell to depolarize and transmit an impulse. At radio frequencies, there is insufficient time during a half-cycle for enough ions to cross the membrane before the alternating voltage reverses. The danger is that since no pain is felt, experimenters often assume the currents are harmless. Teachers and hobbyists demonstrating small Tesla coils often impress their audience by touching the high-voltage terminal or allowing the streamer arcs to pass through their body.

If the arcs from the high-voltage terminal strike the bare skin, they can cause deep-seated burns called &quot;RF burns&quot;. This is often avoided by allowing the arcs to strike a piece of metal held in the hand, or a thimble on a finger, instead. The current passes from the metal into the person&#x27;s hand through a wide enough surface area to avoid causing burns. Often no sensation is felt, or just a warmth or tingling.

However this does not mean the current is harmless. Even a small Tesla coil produces many times the electrical energy necessary to stop the heart, if the frequency happens to be low enough to cause ventricular fibrillation. A minor misadjustment of the coil could result in electrocution. In addition, the RF current heats the tissues it passes through. Carefully controlled Tesla coil currents, applied directly to the skin by electrodes, were used in the early 20th century for deep body tissue heating in the medical field of longwave &quot;diathermy&quot;. The amount of heating depends on the current density, which depends on the power output of the Tesla coil and the cross-sectional area of the path the current takes through the body to ground. Particularly if it passes through narrow structures such as blood vessels or joints it may raise the local tissue temperature to hyperthermic levels, &quot;cooking&quot; internal organs or causing other injuries. International ICNIRP safety standards for RF current in the body in the Tesla coil frequency range of 0.1–1 MHz specify a maximum current density of 0.2 mA per square centimeter and a maximum power absorption rate (SAR) in tissue of 4 W/kg in limbs and 0.8 W/kg average over the body. Even low power Tesla coils could exceed these limits, and it is generally impossible to determine the threshold current where bodily injury begins. Being struck by arcs from a high power Tesla coil is likely to be fatal.

Another reported hazard of this practice is that arcs from the high-voltage terminal often strike the primary winding of the coil. This momentarily creates a conductive path for the lethal primary current from the supply transformer to reach the output terminal. If a person is connected to the output terminal at the time, either by touching it or allowing arcs from the terminal to strike the person&#x27;s body, then the high primary current could pass through the conductive ionized air path, through the body to ground, causing electrocution.

===Skin-effect myth===
An erroneous explanation for the absence of electric shock that has persisted among Tesla coil hobbyists is that the high-frequency currents travel through the body close to the surface, and thus do not penetrate to vital organs or nerves, due to an electromagnetic phenomenon called &quot;skin effect&quot;.

This theory is false. RF current does tend to flow on the surface of conductors due to skin effect, but the depth to which it penetrates, called &quot;skin depth&quot;, depends on the resistivity and permeability of the material as well as the frequency. Although skin effect limits currents of Tesla coil frequencies to the outer fraction of a millimeter in metal conductors, the skin depth of the current in body tissue is much deeper due to its higher resistivity. The depth of penetration of currents of Tesla frequency (0.1 – 1 MHz) in human tissues is roughly 24–72 centimeters (9–28 inches). Since even the deepest tissues are closer than this to the surface, skin effect has little influence on the path of the current through the body; it tends to take the path of minimum electrical impedance to ground, and can easily pass through the core of the body. In the medical therapy called longwave diathermy, carefully controlled RF current of Tesla frequencies was used for decades for deep tissue warming, including heating internal organs such as the lungs. Modern shortwave diathermy machines use a higher frequency of 27 MHz, which would have a correspondingly smaller skin depth, yet these frequencies are still able to penetrate deep body tissues.

<text>La Scala (, , ; officially , ) is a historic opera house in Milan, Italy. The theatre was inaugurated on 3 August 1778 and was originally known as (, which was the former location of a church). The premiere performance was Antonio Salieri&#x27;s &quot;Europa riconosciuta&quot;.

Most of Italy&#x27;s greatest operatic artists, and many of the finest singers from around the world, have appeared at La Scala. The theatre is regarded as one of the leading opera and ballet theatres globally. It is home to the La Scala Theatre Chorus, La Scala Theatre Ballet, La Scala Theatre Orchestra, and the Filarmonica della Scala orchestra. The theatre also has an associate school, known as the La Scala Theatre Academy (), which offers professional training in music, dance, stagecraft, and stage management.

==Overview==

La Scala&#x27;s season opens on 7 December, Saint Ambrose&#x27;s Day, the feast day of Milan&#x27;s patron saint. All performances must end before midnight, and long operas start earlier in the evening when necessary.

The Museo Teatrale alla Scala (La Scala Theatre Museum), accessible from the theatre&#x27;s foyer and a part of the house, contains a collection of paintings, drafts, statues, costumes, and other documents regarding the history of La Scala and of opera in general. La Scala also hosts the Accademia d&#x27;Arti e Mestieri dello Spettacolo (Academy for the Performing Arts). Its goal is to train a new generation of young musicians, technical staff, and dancers (at the Scuola di Ballo del Teatro alla Scala, one of the academy&#x27;s divisions).

Above the boxes, La Scala has a gallery—called the &quot;loggione&quot;—where the less wealthy can watch the performances. The gallery is typically crowded with the most critical opera aficionados, known as the loggionisti, who can be ecstatic or merciless towards singers&#x27; perceived successes or failures. For their failures, artists receive a &quot;baptism of fire&quot; from these aficionados, and fiascos are long remembered. For example, in 2006, tenor Roberto Alagna left the stage after being booed during a performance of &quot;Aida&quot;, forcing his understudy, Antonello Palombi, to quickly replace him mid-scene without time to change into a costume. Alagna did not return to the production.

==History==
A fire destroyed the previous theatre, the Teatro Regio Ducale, on 25 February 1776, after a carnival gala. A group of ninety wealthy Milanese, who owned private boxes in the theatre, wrote to Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este asking for a new theatre and a provisional one to be used while completing the new one. The neoclassical architect Giuseppe Piermarini produced an initial design. However, it was rejected by Count Firmian (the governor of the then Austrian Lombardy).

A second plan was accepted in 1776 by Empress Maria Theresa. The new theatre was built on the former location of the church of Santa Maria della Scala, from which the theatre gets its name. The church was deconsecrated and demolished. Over a period of two years, the theatre was completed by Pietro Marliani, Pietro Nosetti, and Antonio and Giuseppe Fe. The theatre had a total of &quot;3,000 or so&quot; seats organized into 678 pit-stalls, arranged in six tiers of boxes above which is the &#x27;loggione&#x27; or two galleries. Its stage is one of the largest in Italy (16.15m d x 20.4m w x 26m h).

Building expenses were covered by the sale of boxes, which were lavishly decorated by their owners, impressing observers such as Stendhal. La Scala (as it came to be known) soon became the preeminent meeting place for noble and wealthy Milanese people. In the tradition of the times, the main floor had no chairs, and spectators watched the shows standing up. The orchestra was in full sight, as the orchestra pit had not yet been built.

As with most of the theatres at that time, La Scala was also a casino, with gamblers sitting in the foyer. Conditions in the auditorium, too, could be frustrating for the opera lover, as Mary Shelley discovered in September 1840:

At the Opera they were giving Otto Nicolai&#x27;s &quot;Templario&quot;. Unfortunately, as is well known, the theatre of La Scala serves, not only as the universal drawing-room for all the society of Milan but every sort of trading transaction, from horse-dealing to stock-jobbing, is carried on in the pit; so that brief and far between are the snatches of melody one can catch.

La Scala was originally illuminated with 84 oil lamps mounted on the stage and another thousand in the rest of the theatre. To reduce the risks of fire, several rooms were filled with hundreds of water buckets. In time, oil lamps were replaced by gas lamps; these, in turn, were replaced by electric lights in 1883.

The original structure was renovated in 1907 when it was given its current layout with 1,987 seats. In 1943, during World War II, La Scala was severely damaged by bombing. It was rebuilt and reopened on 11 May 1946, with a memorable concert conducted by Arturo Toscanini—twice La Scala&#x27;s principal conductor and an associate of the composers Giuseppe Verdi and Giacomo Puccini—with a soprano solo by Renata Tebaldi, which created a sensation.

La Scala hosted the first productions of many famous operas and had a special relationship with Verdi. However, for several years, Verdi did not allow his work to be played here, as some of his music had been modified (he said &quot;corrupted&quot;) by the orchestra. This dispute originated in a disagreement over the production of his &quot;Giovanna d&#x27;Arco&quot; in 1845; however, the composer later conducted his &quot;Requiem&quot; there on 25 May 1874. He announced in 1886 that La Scala would host the premiere of what was to become his penultimate opera, &quot;Otello&quot;. The premiere of his last opera, &quot;Falstaff&quot; was also given in the theatre.

===Filarmonica della Scala===

In 1982, the Filarmonica della Scala orchestra was established to develop a symphonic repertoire to add to La Scala&#x27;s operatic tradition, the orchestra drawing its members from the larger pool of musicians that comprise the Orchestra della Scala. The Filarmonica was conducted first by Carlo Maria Giulini, then by Riccardo Muti, plus many collaborative relations with some of the greatest conductors of the time.

==Recent developments==

===1950s===

As early as 1958 R. Vermeulen of Philips Electronics experimented with &quot;loudspeakers for stereo reverberation&quot; at La Scala, which were &quot;concealed in the cove along the ceiling&quot;.

===Major renovation, 2002 to 2004===

The theatre underwent a major renovation from early 2002 to late 2004. The theatre closed following the traditional 7 December 2001 season-opening performances of &quot;Otello&quot;, which ran through December. From 19 January 2002 to November 2004, the opera company transferred to the new Teatro degli Arcimboldi, built in the Pirelli-Bicocca industrial area from the city center.
The renovation by architect Mario Botta proved controversial, as preservationists feared that historic details would be lost. However, the opera company was satisfied with the improvements to the structure and the sound quality, which was enhanced when the heavy red carpets in the hall were removed. The stage was entirely rebuilt, and an enlarged backstage allows more sets to be stored, permitting more productions.

Seats now include monitors for the electronic libretto system provided by Radio Marconi, an Italian company, allowing audiences to follow opera libretti in English and Italian in addition to the original language.

The opera house re-opened on 7 December 2004 with a production, conducted by Riccardo Muti, of Salieri&#x27;s &quot;Europa riconosciuta&quot;, the opera performed at La Scala&#x27;s inauguration in 1778. Tickets for the re-opening fetched up to €2,000.

The renovations cost a reported €61 million and left a budget shortfall that the opera house overcame in 2006.

===2005 onward===

Carlo Fontana, the general manager of La Scala since 1990, was dismissed in February 2005 by the board of governors over differences with the music director, Riccardo Muti. The resulting staff backlash caused serious disruptions and staff strikes. In a statement, the theatre&#x27;s board said it was &quot;urgent to unify the theatre&#x27;s management&quot;. On 16 March 2005, the La Scala orchestra and other staff overwhelmingly approved a no-confidence motion against Muti. They demanded the resignation of Fontana&#x27;s replacement, Mauro Meli. Muti had already been forced to cancel a concert a few days earlier because of the disagreements. Italy&#x27;s culture minister, Giuliano Urbani, supported the conductor but called for urgent action by management to safeguard the smooth operation and prestige of La Scala. On 2 April 2005, Muti resigned from La Scala, citing &quot;hostility&quot; from staff members. 

In May 2005, Stéphane Lissner, formerly head of the Aix-en-Provence Festival, was appointed General Manager and artistic director of La Scala, becoming the first non-Italian in its history to hold the office. On 15 May 2006, Daniel Barenboim was named &quot;Maestro Scaligero&quot;, or &quot;de facto&quot; principal guest conductor of the company. In October 2011, Barenboim was appointed the next music director of La Scala, effective December 2011, with an initial contract of 5 years.

In December 2013, management named Riccardo Chailly the next music director of La Scala, effective 1 January 2015.

Stéphane Lissner left La Scala for the Paris Opera. His successor , formerly director of the Salzburg Festival, began his tenure on 1 October 2014. In June 2019 it was announced that Pereira will leave in 2020 and will be replaced by Dominique Meyer.

La Scala was originally selected to host the opening ceremony of the 134th IOC Session in 2019, but the event was moved to Lausanne, Switzerland after Milan submitted a joint bid with Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo for the 2026 Winter Olympics.

<text>Nvidia Corporation ( ) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, and incorporated in Delaware. Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang (president and CEO), Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, it is a software company which designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing, and system on a chip units (SoCs) for mobile computing and the automotive market. Nvidia is also a leading supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software. Nvidia outsources the manufacturing of the hardware it designs.

Nvidia&#x27;s professional line of GPUs are used for edge-to-cloud computing and in supercomputers and workstations for applications in fields such as architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific research, and manufacturing design. Its GeForce line of GPUs are aimed at the consumer market and are used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering, and PC gaming. With a market share of 80.2% in the second quarter of 2023, Nvidia leads global sales of discrete desktop GPUs by a wide margin. The company expanded its presence in the gaming industry with the introduction of the Shield Portable (a handheld game console), Shield Tablet (a gaming tablet), and Shield TV (a digital media player), as well as its cloud gaming service GeForce Now.

In addition to GPU design and outsourcing manufacturing, Nvidia provides the CUDA software platform and API that allows the creation of massively parallel programs which utilize GPUs. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. In the late 2000s, Nvidia had moved into the mobile computing market, where it produced Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets and vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. Its competitors include AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, and AI accelerator companies such as Cerebras and Graphcore. It also makes AI-powered software for audio and video processing (e.g., Nvidia Maxine).

Nvidia&#x27;s attempt to acquire Arm from SoftBank in September 2020 failed to materialize following extended regulatory scrutiny, leading to the termination of the deal in February 2022 in what would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition. In 2023, Nvidia became the seventh public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion, and the company&#x27;s valuation has increased rapidly since then amid growing demand for data center chips with AI capabilities in the midst of the AI boom. In June 2024, for one day, Nvidia overtook Microsoft as the world&#x27;s most valuable publicly traded company, with a market capitalization of over $3.3 trillion.

== History ==

=== Founding ===

Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang (who, , remains CEO), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems. The three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at a Denny&#x27;s roadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San Jose.

At the time, Malachowsky and Priem were frustrated with Sun&#x27;s management and were looking to leave, but Huang was on &quot;firmer ground&quot;, in that he was already running his own division at LSI. The three co-founders discussed a vision of the future which was so compelling that Huang decided to leave LSI and become the chief executive officer of their new startup.

In 1993, the three co-founders envisioned graphics-based processing as the best trajectory for tackling challenges that had eluded general-purpose computing methods. As Huang later explained: &quot;We also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume. Those two conditions don’t happen very often. Video games was our killer app — a flywheel to reach large markets funding huge R&amp;D to solve massive computational problems.&quot; With $40,000 in the bank, the company was born. The company subsequently received $20 million of venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital, Sutter Hill Ventures and others.

During the late 1990s, Nvidia was one of 70 startup companies pursuing the idea that graphics acceleration for video games was the path to the future. Only two survived: Nvidia and ATI Technologies, the latter of which merged into AMD.

Nvidia initially had no name and the co-founders named all their files NV, as in &quot;next version&quot;. The need to incorporate the company prompted the co-founders to review all words with those two letters. At one point, Malachowsky and Priem wanted to call the company NVision, but that name was already taken by a manufacturer of toilet paper. Other names like &quot;Primal Graphics&quot; and &quot;Huaprimal&quot; were considered, but Huang suggested the name Nvidia, from &quot;invidia&quot;, the Latin word for &quot;envy&quot;. The company&#x27;s original headquarters office was in Sunnyvale, California.

=== First graphics accelerator ===
Nvidia&#x27;s first graphics accelerator, the NV1, was designed to process quadrilateral primitives (forward texture mapping), a feature that set it apart from competitors, who preferred triangle primitives. However, when Microsoft introduced the DirectX platform, it chose not to support any other graphics software and announced that its Direct3D API would exclusively support triangles. As a result, the NV1 failed to gain traction in the market.

Nvidia had also entered into a partnership with Sega to supply the graphics chip for the Dreamcast console and worked on the project for about a year. However, Nvidia&#x27;s technology was already lagging behind competitors. This placed the company in a difficult position: continue working on a chip that was likely doomed to fail or abandon the project, risking financial collapse.

In a pivotal moment, Sega&#x27;s president, Shoichiro Irimajiri, visited Huang in person to inform him that Sega had decided to choose another vendor for the Dreamcast. However, Irimajiri believed in Nvidia&#x27;s potential and persuaded Sega’s management to invest $5 million into the company. Huang later reflected that this funding was all that kept Nvidia afloat, and that Irimajiri&#x27;s &quot;understanding and generosity gave us six months to live&quot;.

In 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia&#x27;s employees—thereby reducing headcount from 100 to 40—and focused the company&#x27;s remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product optimized for processing triangle primitives: the RIVA 128. By the time the RIVA 128 was released in August 1997, Nvidia had only enough money left for one month’s payroll. The sense of impending failure became so pervasive that it gave rise to Nvidia&#x27;s unofficial company motto: &quot;Our company is thirty days from going out of business.&quot; Huang began internal presentations to Nvidia staff with those words for many years.

Nvidia sold about a million RIVA 128 units within four months, and used the revenue to fund development of its next generation of products. In 1998, the release of the RIVA TNT helped solidify Nvidia’s reputation as a leader in graphics technology.

=== Public company ===
Nvidia went public on January 22, 1999. Investing in Nvidia after it had already failed to deliver on its contract turned out to be Irimajiri&#x27;s best decision as Sega&#x27;s president. After Irimajiri left Sega in 2000, Sega sold its Nvidia stock for $15 million.

In late 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256 (NV10), its first product expressly marketed as a GPU, which was most notable for introducing onboard transformation and lighting (T&amp;L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.

Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project took many of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the GeForce2 GTS shipped in the summer of 2000. In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival 3dfx, a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology leading the field from the mid-1990s until 2000. The acquisition process was finalized in April 2002.

In 2001, Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s selected Nvidia to replace the departing Enron in the S&amp;P 500 stock index, meaning that index funds would need to hold Nvidia shares going forward.

In July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum. Exluna made software-rendering tools and the personnel were merged into the Cg project. In August 2003, Nvidia acquired MediaQ for approximately US$70 million. It launched GoForce the follow year. On April 22, 2004, Nvidia acquired iReady, also a provider of high-performance TCP offload engines and iSCSI controllers. In December 2004, it was announced that Nvidia would assist Sony with the design of the graphics processor (RSX) for the PlayStation 3 game console. On December 14, 2005, Nvidia acquired ULI Electronics, which at the time supplied third-party southbridge parts for chipsets to ATI, Nvidia&#x27;s competitor. In March 2006, Nvidia acquired Hybrid Graphics. In December 2006, Nvidia, along with its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry.

=== 2007–2014 ===
&quot;Forbes&quot; named Nvidia its &quot;Company of the Year&quot; for 2007, citing the accomplishments it made during the said period as well as during the previous five years. On January 5, 2007, Nvidia announced that it had completed the acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc. In February 2008, Nvidia acquired Ageia, developer of PhysX, a physics engine and physics processing unit. Nvidia announced that it planned to integrate the PhysX technology into its future GPU products.

In July 2008, Nvidia took a write-down of approximately $200 million on its first-quarter revenue, after reporting that certain mobile chipsets and GPUs produced by the company had &quot;abnormal failure rates&quot; due to manufacturing defects. Nvidia, however, did not reveal the affected products. In September 2008, Nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects, claiming that the faulty GPUs had been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by Apple Inc., Dell, and HP. In September 2010, Nvidia reached a settlement, in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs or, in some cases, replacement. On January 10, 2011, Nvidia signed a six-year, $1.5 billion cross-licensing agreement with Intel, ending all litigation between the two companies.

In November 2011, after initially unveiling it at Mobile World Congress, Nvidia released its ARM-based system on a chip for mobile devices, Tegra 3. Nvidia claimed that the chip featured the first-ever quad-core mobile CPU. In May 2011, it was announced that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Icera, a baseband chip making company in the UK, for $367 million. In January 2013, Nvidia unveiled the Tegra 4, as well as the Nvidia Shield, an Android-based handheld game console powered by the new system on a chip. On July 29, 2013, Nvidia announced that they acquired PGI from STMicroelectronics.

In February 2013, Nvidia announced its plans to build a new headquarters in the form of two giant triangle-shaped buildings on the other side of San Tomas Expressway (to the west of its existing headquarters complex). The company selected triangles as its design theme. As Huang explained in a blog post, the triangle is &quot;the fundamental building block of computer graphics&quot;.

In 2014, Nvidia ported the Valve games &quot;Portal&quot; and &quot;Half Life 2&quot; to its Nvidia Shield tablet as Lightspeed Studio. Since 2014, Nvidia has diversified its business focusing on three markets: gaming, automotive electronics, and mobile devices.

That same year, Nvidia also prevailed in litigation brought by the trustee of 3dfx&#x27;s bankruptcy estate to challenge its 2000 acquisition of 3dfx&#x27;s intellectual assets. On November 6, 2014, in an unpublished memorandum order, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the &quot;district court&#x27;s judgment affirming the bankruptcy court&#x27;s determination that [Nvidia] did not pay less than fair market value for assets purchased from 3dfx shortly before 3dfx filed for bankruptcy&quot;.

=== 2016–2018 ===
On May 6, 2016, Nvidia unveiled the first GPUs of the GeForce 10 series, the GTX 1080 and 1070, based on the company&#x27;s new Pascal microarchitecture. Nvidia claimed that both models outperformed its Maxwell-based Titan X model; the models incorporate GDDR5X and GDDR5 memory respectively, and use a 16 nm manufacturing process. The architecture also supports a new hardware feature known as simultaneous multi-projection (SMP), which is designed to improve the quality of multi-monitor and virtual reality rendering. Laptops that include these GPUs and are sufficiently thin – as of late 2017, under  – have been designated as meeting Nvidia&#x27;s &quot;Max-Q&quot; design standard.

In July 2016, Nvidia agreed to a settlement for a false advertising lawsuit regarding its GTX 970 model, as the models were unable to use all of their advertised 4 GB of VRAM due to limitations brought by the design of its hardware. In May 2017, Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota which would use Nvidia&#x27;s Drive PX-series artificial intelligence platform for its autonomous vehicles. In July 2017, Nvidia and Chinese search giant Baidu announced a far-reaching AI partnership that includes cloud computing, autonomous driving, consumer devices, and Baidu&#x27;s open-source AI framework PaddlePaddle. Baidu unveiled that Nvidia&#x27;s Drive PX 2 AI will be the foundation of its autonomous-vehicle platform.

Nvidia officially released the Titan V on December 7, 2017.

Nvidia officially released the Nvidia Quadro GV100 on March 27, 2018. Nvidia officially released the RTX 2080 GPUs on September 27, 2018. In 2018, Google announced that Nvidia&#x27;s Tesla P4 graphic cards would be integrated into Google Cloud service&#x27;s artificial intelligence.

In May 2018, on the Nvidia user forum, a thread was started asking the company to update users when they would release web drivers for its cards installed on legacy Mac Pro machines up to mid-2012 5,1 running the macOS Mojave operating system 10.14. Web drivers are required to enable graphics acceleration and multiple display monitor capabilities of the GPU. On its Mojave update info website, Apple stated that macOS Mojave would run on legacy machines with &#x27;Metal compatible&#x27; graphics cards and listed Metal compatible GPUs, including some manufactured by Nvidia. However, this list did not include Metal compatible cards that currently work in macOS High Sierra using Nvidia-developed web drivers. In September, Nvidia responded, &quot;Apple fully controls drivers for macOS. But if Apple allows, our engineers are ready and eager to help Apple deliver great drivers for macOS 10.14 (Mojave).&quot; In October, Nvidia followed this up with another public announcement, &quot;Apple fully controls drivers for macOS. Unfortunately, Nvidia currently cannot release a driver unless it is approved by Apple,&quot; suggesting a possible rift between the two companies. By January 2019, with still no sign of the enabling web drivers, Apple Insider weighed into the controversy with a claim that Apple management &quot;doesn&#x27;t want Nvidia support in macOS&quot;. The following month, Apple Insider followed this up with another claim that Nvidia support was abandoned because of &quot;relational issues in the past&quot;, and that Apple was developing its own GPU technology. Without Apple-approved Nvidia web drivers, Apple users are faced with replacing their Nvidia cards with a competing supported brand, such as AMD Radeon from the list recommended by Apple.

=== 2019 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies ===

On March 11, 2019, Nvidia announced a deal to buy Mellanox Technologies for $6.9 billion to substantially expand its footprint in the high-performance computing market. In May 2019, Nvidia announced new RTX Studio laptops. The creators say that the new laptop is going to be seven times faster than a top-end MacBook Pro with a Core i9 and AMD&#x27;s Radeon Pro Vega 20 graphics in apps like Maya and RedCine-X Pro. In August 2019, Nvidia announced &quot;Minecraft RTX&quot;, an official Nvidia-developed patch for the game &quot;Minecraft&quot; adding real-time DXR ray tracing exclusively to the Windows 10 version of the game. The whole game is, in Nvidia&#x27;s words, &quot;refit&quot; with path tracing, which dramatically affects the way light, reflections, and shadows work inside the engine.

=== 2020–2023 ===
In May 2020, Nvidia announced it was acquiring Cumulus Networks. Post acquisition the company was absorbed into Nvidia&#x27;s networking business unit, along with Mellanox.

In May 2020, Nvidia&#x27;s developed an open-source ventilator to address the shortage resulting from the global coronavirus pandemic. On May 14, 2020, Nvidia officially announced their Ampere GPU microarchitecture and the Nvidia A100 GPU accelerator. In July 2020, it was reported that Nvidia was in talks with SoftBank to buy Arm, a UK-based chip designer, for $32 billion.

On September 1, 2020, Nvidia officially announced the GeForce 30 series based on the company&#x27;s new Ampere microarchitecture.

On September 13, 2020, Nvidia announced that they would buy Arm from SoftBank Group for $40 billion, subject to the usual scrutiny, with the latter retaining a 10% share of Nvidia.

In October 2020, Nvidia announced its plan to build the most powerful computer in Cambridge, England. The computer, called Cambridge-1, launched in July 2021 with a $100 million investment and will employ AI to support healthcare research. According to Jensen Huang, &quot;The Cambridge-1 supercomputer will serve as a hub of innovation for the UK, and further the groundbreaking work being done by the nation&#x27;s researchers in critical healthcare and drug discovery.&quot;

Also in October 2020, along with the release of the Nvidia RTX A6000, Nvidia announced it is retiring its workstation GPU brand Quadro, shifting its product name to Nvidia RTX for future products and the manufacturing to be Nvidia Ampere architecture-based.

In August 2021, the proposed takeover of Arm was stalled after the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority raised &quot;significant competition concerns&quot;. In October 2021, the European Commission opened a competition investigation into the takeover. The Commission stated that Nvidia&#x27;s acquisition could restrict competitors&#x27; access to Arm&#x27;s products and provide Nvidia with too much internal information on its competitors due to their deals with Arm. SoftBank (the parent company of Arm) and Nvidia announced in early February 2022 that they &quot;had agreed not to move forward with the transaction &#x27;because of significant regulatory challenges&#x27;&quot;. The investigation is set to end on March 15, 2022. That same month, Nvidia was reportedly compromised by a cyberattack.

In March 2022, Nvidia&#x27;s CEO Jensen Huang mentioned that they are open to having Intel manufacture their chips in the future. This was the first time the company mentioned that they would work together with Intel&#x27;s upcoming foundry services.

In April 2022, it was reported that Nvidia planned to open a new research center in Yerevan, Armenia.

In May 2022, Nvidia opened Voyager, the second of the two giant buildings at its new headquarters complex to the west of the old one. Unlike its smaller and older sibling Endeavor, the triangle theming is used more &quot;sparingly&quot; in Voyager.

In September 2022, Nvidia announced its next-generation automotive-grade chip, Drive Thor.

In September 2022, Nvidia announced a collaboration with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard related to the entire suite of Nvidia&#x27;s AI-powered healthcare software suite called Clara, that includes Parabricks and MONAI. 

Following U.S. Department of Commerce regulations which placed an embargo on exports to China of advanced microchips, which went into effect in October 2022, Nvidia saw its data center chip added to the export control list. The next month, the company unveiled a new advanced chip in China, called the A800 GPU, that met the export control rules.

In September 2023, Getty Images announced that it was partnering with Nvidia to launch Generative AI by Getty Images, a new tool that lets people create images using Getty&#x27;s library of licensed photos. Getty will use Nvidia&#x27;s Edify model, which is available on Nvidia&#x27;s generative AI model library Picasso.

On September 26, 2023, Denny&#x27;s CEO Kelli Valade joined Huang in East San Jose to celebrate the founding of Nvidia at Denny&#x27;s on Berryessa Road, where a plaque was installed to mark the relevant corner booth as the birthplace of a $1 trillion company. By then, Nvidia&#x27;s H100 GPUs were in such demand that even other tech giants were beholden to how Nvidia allocated supply. Larry Ellison of Oracle Corporation said that month that during a dinner with Huang at Nobu in Palo Alto, he and Elon Musk of Tesla, Inc. and xAI &quot;were begging&quot; for H100s, &quot;I guess is the best way to describe it. An hour of sushi and begging&quot;.

In October 2023, it was reported that Nvidia had quietly begun designing ARM-based central processing units (CPUs) for Microsoft&#x27;s Windows operating system with a target to start selling them in 2025.

=== 2024–2025 ===
In January 2024, &quot;Forbes&quot; reported that Nvidia has increased its lobbying presence in Washington, D.C. as American lawmakers consider proposals to regulate artificial intelligence. From 2023 to 2024, the company reportedly hired at least four government affairs with professional backgrounds at agencies including the United States Department of State and the Department of the Treasury. It was noted that the $350,000 spent by the company on lobbying in 2023 was small compared to a number of major tech companies in the artificial intelligence space.

As of January 2024, Raymond James Financial analysts estimated that Nvidia was selling the H100 GPU in the price range of $25,000 to $30,000 each, while on eBay, individual H100s cost over $40,000. Tech giants were purchasing tens or hundreds of thousands of GPUs for their data centers to run generative artificial intelligence projects; simple arithmetic implied that they were committing to billions of dollars in capital expenditures.

In February 2024, it was reported that Nvidia was the &quot;hot employer&quot; in Silicon Valley because it was offering interesting work and good pay at a time when other tech employers were downsizing. Half of Nvidia employees earned over $228,000 in 2023. By then, Nvidia GPUs had become so valuable that they needed special security while in transit to data centers. Cisco chief information officer Fletcher Previn explained at a CIO summit: &quot;Those GPUs arrive by armored car&quot;.

On March 1, 2024, Nvidia became the third company in the history of the United States to close with a market capitalization in excess of $2 trillion. Nvidia needed only 180 days to get to $2 trillion from $1 trillion, while the first two companies, Apple and Microsoft, each took over 500 days. On March 18, Nvidia announced its new AI chip and microarchitecture Blackwell, named after mathematician David Blackwell.

In April 2024, Reuters reported that China had allegedly acquired banned Nvidia chips and servers from Supermicro and Dell via tenders.

In June 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Justice Department (DOJ) began antitrust investigations into Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI, focusing on their influence in the AI industry. The FTC led the investigations into Microsoft and OpenAI, while the DOJ handled Nvidia. The probes centered on the companies&#x27; conduct rather than mergers. This development followed an open letter from OpenAI employees expressing concerns about the rapid AI advancements and lack of oversight.

The company became the world&#x27;s most valuable, surpassing Microsoft and Apple, on June 18, 2024, after its market capitalization exceeded $3.3 trillion.

In June 2024, Trend Micro announced a partnership with Nvidia to develop AI-driven security tools, notably to protect the data centers where AI workloads are processed. This collaboration integrates Nvidia NIM and Nvidia Morpheus with Trend Vision One and its Sovereign and Private Cloud solutions to improve data privacy, real-time analysis, and rapid threat mitigation.

Nvidia introduced a family of open-source multimodal large language models in October 2024 called NVLM 1.0, which features a flagship version with 72 billion parameters, designed to improve text-only performance after multimodal training.

In November 2024, the company was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

In November 2024, Morgan Stanley reported that &quot;the entire 2025 production&quot; of all of Nvidia&#x27;s Blackwell chips was &quot;already sold out&quot;.

Also in November 2024, the company made an investment in Nebius Group.

Nvidia was ranked #3 on Forbes&#x27; &quot;Best Places to Work&quot; list in 2024.

In January 2025, Nvidia saw the largest one-day loss in market capitalization for a U.S. company in history at $600 billion. This was due to DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that developed an advanced AI model at a lower cost and computing power. DeepSeek&#x27;s AI assistant, using the V3 model, surpassed ChatGPT as the highest-rated free app in the U.S. on Apple&#x27;s App Store.

Nvidia uses external suppliers for all phases of manufacturing, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. Nvidia thus avoids most of the investment and production costs and risks associated with chip manufacturing, although it does sometimes directly procure some components and materials used in the production of its products (e.g., memory and substrates). Nvidia focuses its own resources on product design, quality assurance, marketing, and customer support.

=== Finances ===

For the fiscal year 2020, Nvidia reported earnings of US$2.796 billion, with an annual revenue of US$10.918 billion, a decline of 6.8% over the previous fiscal cycle. Nvidia&#x27;s shares traded at over $531 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$328.7 billion in January 2021. As of late Q3 2024, Nvidia&#x27;s market cap is around US$2.98 trillion.

For the Q2 of 2020, Nvidia reported sales of $3.87 billion, which was a 50% rise from the same period in 2019. The surge in sales and people&#x27;s higher demand for computer technology. According to the financial chief of the company, Colette Kress, the effects of the pandemic will &quot;likely reflect this evolution in enterprise workforce trends with a greater focus on technologies, such as Nvidia laptops and virtual workstations, that enable remote work and virtual collaboration.&quot; In May 2023, Nvidia crossed $1 trillion in market valuation during trading hours, and grew to $1.2 trillion by the following November. For its strength, size and market capitalization, Nvidia has been selected to be one of Bloomberg&#x27;s &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot;, the seven biggest companies on the stock market in these regards.

== GPU Technology Conference ==

Nvidia&#x27;s GPU Technology Conference (GTC) is a series of technical conferences held around the world. It originated in 2009 in San Jose, California, with an initial focus on the potential for solving computing challenges through GPUs. In recent years, the conference&#x27;s focus has shifted to various applications of artificial intelligence and deep learning; including self-driving cars, healthcare, high-performance computing, and Nvidia Deep Learning Institute (DLI) training. GTC 2018 attracted over 8400 attendees. GTC 2020 was converted to a digital event and drew roughly 59,000 registrants. After several years of remote-only events, GTC in March 2024 returned to an in-person format in San Jose, California.

== Open-source software support ==

Until September 23, 2013, Nvidia had not published any documentation for its advanced hardware, meaning that programmers could not write free and open-source device driver for its products without resorting to reverse engineering.

Instead, Nvidia provides its own binary GeForce graphics drivers for X.Org and an open-source library that interfaces with the Linux, FreeBSD or Solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software. Nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated open-source driver that only supports two-dimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the X.Org distribution.

The proprietary nature of Nvidia&#x27;s drivers has generated dissatisfaction within free-software communities. In a 2012 talk, Linus Torvalds, in criticism of Nvidia&#x27;s approach towards Linux, raised the finger and stated &quot;Nvidia, fuck you.&quot; Some Linux and BSD users insist on using only open-source drivers and regard Nvidia&#x27;s insistence on providing nothing more than a binary-only driver as inadequate, given that competing manufacturers such as Intel offer support and documentation for open-source developers and that others (like AMD) release partial documentation and provide some active development.

Nvidia only provides x86/x64 and ARMv7-A versions of their proprietary driver; as a result, features like CUDA are unavailable on other platforms. Some users claim that Nvidia&#x27;s Linux drivers impose artificial restrictions, like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time, but the company has not commented on these accusations.

In 2014, with Maxwell GPUs, Nvidia started to require firmware by them to unlock all features of its graphics cards.

On May 12, 2022, Nvidia announced that they are opensourcing their GPU kernel modules. Support for Nvidia&#x27;s firmware was implemented in nouveau in 2023, which allows proper power management and GPU reclocking for Turing and newer graphics card generations.

== Deep learning ==
Nvidia GPUs are used in deep learning, and accelerated analytics due to Nvidia&#x27;s CUDA software platform and API which allows programmers to utilize the higher number of cores present in GPUs to parallelize BLAS operations which are extensively used in machine learning algorithms. They were included in many Tesla, Inc. vehicles before Musk announced at Tesla Autonomy Day in 2019 that the company developed its own SoC and full self-driving computer now and would stop using Nvidia hardware for their vehicles. These GPUs are used by researchers, laboratories, tech companies and enterprise companies. In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the &quot;big bang&quot; of deep learning, &quot;as deep-learning neural networks were combined with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs)&quot;. That year, the Google Brain team used Nvidia GPUs to create deep neural networks capable of machine learning, where Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep learning systems by about 100 times.

=== DGX ===

DGX is a line of supercomputers by Nvidia.

In April 2016, Nvidia produced the DGX-1 based on an 8 GPU cluster, to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining GPUs with integrated deep learning software. Nvidia gifted its first DGX-1 to OpenAI in August 2016 to help it train larger and more complex AI models with the capability of reducing processing time from six days to two hours. It also developed Nvidia Tesla K80 and P100 GPU-based virtual machines, which are available through Google Cloud, which Google installed in November 2016. Microsoft added GPU servers in a preview offering of its N series based on Nvidia&#x27;s Tesla K80s, each containing 4992 processing cores. Later that year, AWS&#x27;s P2 instance was produced using up to 16 Nvidia Tesla K80 GPUs. That month Nvidia also partnered with IBM to create a software kit that boosts the AI capabilities of Watson, called IBM PowerAI. Nvidia also offers its own Nvidia Deep Learning software development kit. In 2017, the GPUs were also brought online at the Riken Center for Advanced Intelligence Project for Fujitsu. The company&#x27;s deep learning technology led to a boost in its 2017 earnings.

In May 2018, researchers at the artificial intelligence department of Nvidia realized the possibility that a robot can learn to perform a job simply by observing the person doing the same job. They have created a system that, after a short revision and testing, can already be used to control the universal robots of the next generation. In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers and scientists that allow them to efficiently run high-performance applications.

=== Robotics ===
In 2020, Nvidia unveiled &quot;Omniverse&quot;, a virtual environment designed for engineers. Nvidia also open-sourced Isaac Sim, which makes use of this Omniverse to train robots through simulations that mimic the physics of the robots and the real world.

In 2024, Huang oriented Nvidia&#x27;s focus towards humanoid robots and self-driving cars, which he expects to gain widespread adoption.

== Inception Program ==
Nvidia&#x27;s Inception Program was created to support startups making exceptional advances in the fields of artificial intelligence and data science. Award winners are announced at Nvidia&#x27;s GTC Conference. In May 2017, the program had 1,300 companies. As of March 2018, there were 2,800 startups in the Inception Program. As of August 2021, the program has surpassed 8,500 members in 90 countries, with cumulative funding of US$60 billion.

== Controversies ==
=== Maxwell advertising dispute ===
=== GTX 970 hardware specifications ===
Issues with the GeForce GTX 970&#x27;s specifications were first brought up by users when they found out that the cards, while featuring 4 GB of memory, rarely accessed memory over the 3.5 GB boundary. Further testing and investigation eventually led to Nvidia issuing a statement that the card&#x27;s initially announced specifications had been altered without notice before the card was made commercially available, and that the card took a performance hit once memory over the 3.5 GB limit were put into use.

The card&#x27;s back-end hardware specifications, initially announced as being identical to those of the GeForce GTX 980, differed in the amount of L2 cache (1.75 MB versus 2 MB in the GeForce GTX 980) and the number of ROPs (56 versus 64 in the 980). Additionally, it was revealed that the card was designed to access its memory as a 3.5 GB section, plus a 0.5 GB one, access to the latter being 7 times slower than the first one. The company then went on to promise a specific driver modification to alleviate the performance issues produced by the cutbacks suffered by the card. However, Nvidia later clarified that the promise had been a miscommunication and there would be no specific driver update for the GTX 970. Nvidia claimed that it would assist customers who wanted refunds in obtaining them. On February 26, 2015, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang went on record in Nvidia&#x27;s official blog to apologize for the incident. In February 2015 a class-action lawsuit alleging false advertising was filed against Nvidia and Gigabyte Technology in the U.S. District Court for Northern California.

Nvidia revealed that it is able to disable individual units, each containing 256 KB of L2 cache and 8 ROPs, without disabling whole memory controllers. This comes at the cost of dividing the memory bus into high speed and low speed segments that cannot be accessed at the same time unless one segment is reading while the other segment is writing because the L2/ROP unit managing both of the GDDR5 controllers shares the read return channel and the write data bus between the two GDDR5 controllers and itself. This is used in the GeForce GTX 970, which therefore can be described as having 3.5 GB in its high speed segment on a 224-bit bus and 0.5 GB in a low speed segment on a 32-bit bus.

On July 27, 2016, Nvidia agreed to a preliminary settlement of the U.S. class action lawsuit, offering a $30 refund on GTX 970 purchases. The agreed upon refund represents the portion of the cost of the storage and performance capabilities the consumers assumed they were obtaining when they purchased the card.

=== GeForce Partner Program ===

The Nvidia GeForce Partner Program was a marketing program designed to provide partnering companies with benefits such as public relations support, video game bundling, and marketing development funds. The program proved to be controversial, with complaints about it possibly being an anti-competitive practice.

First announced in a blog post on March 1, 2018, it was canceled on May 4, 2018.

=== Hardware Unboxed ===
On December 10, 2020, Nvidia told YouTube tech reviewer Steven Walton of Hardware Unboxed that it would no longer supply him with GeForce Founders Edition graphics card review units. In a Twitter message, Hardware Unboxed said, &quot;Nvidia have officially decided to ban us from receiving GeForce Founders Edition GPU review samples. Their reasoning is that we are focusing on rasterization instead of ray tracing. They have said they will revisit this &#x27;should your editorial direction change.&#x27;&quot;

In emails that were disclosed by Walton from Nvidia Senior PR Manager Bryan Del Rizzo, Nvidia had said:...your GPU reviews and recommendations have continued to focus singularly on rasterization performance, and you have largely discounted all of the other technologies we offer gamers. It is very clear from your community commentary that you do not see things the same way that we, gamers, and the rest of the industry do.TechSpot, partner site of Hardware Unboxed, said, &quot;this and other related incidents raise serious questions around journalistic independence and what they are expecting of reviewers when they are sent products for an unbiased opinion.&quot;

A number of technology reviewers came out strongly against Nvidia&#x27;s move. Linus Sebastian, of Linus Tech Tips, titled the episode of his weekly WAN Show, &quot;NVIDIA might ACTUALLY be EVIL...&quot; and was highly critical of the company&#x27;s move to dictate specific outcomes of technology reviews. The review site Gamers Nexus said it was, &quot;Nvidia&#x27;s latest decision to shoot both its feet: They&#x27;ve now made it so that any reviewers covering RT will become subject to scrutiny from untrusting viewers who will suspect subversion by the company. Shortsighted self-own from NVIDIA.&quot;

Two days later, Nvidia reversed their stance. Hardware Unboxed sent out a Twitter message, &quot;I just received an email from Nvidia apologizing for the previous email &amp; they&#x27;ve now walked everything back.&quot; On December 14, Hardware Unboxed released a video explaining the controversy from their viewpoint. Via Twitter, they also shared a second apology sent by Nvidia&#x27;s Del Rizzo that said &quot;to withhold samples because I didn&#x27;t agree with your commentary is simply inexcusable and crossed the line.&quot;

=== Improper disclosures about cryptomining ===
In 2018, Nvidia&#x27;s chips became popular for cryptomining, the process of obtaining crypto rewards in exchange for verifying transactions on distributed ledgers, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said. However, the company failed to disclose that it was a &quot;significant element&quot; of its revenue growth from sales of chips designed for gaming, the SEC further added in a statement and charging order. Those omissions misled investors and analysts who were interested in understanding the impact of cryptomining on Nvidia&#x27;s business, the SEC emphasized. Nvidia, which did not admit or deny the findings, has agreed to pay $5.5 million to settle civil charges, according to a statement made by the SEC in May 2022.

<doc id="39122" wikidata="Q283705" url="?curid=39122" title="Z/OS">
<text>z/OS is a 64-bit operating system for IBM z/Architecture mainframes, introduced by IBM in October 2000. It derives from and is the successor to OS/390, which in turn was preceded by a string of MVS versions. Like OS/390, z/OS combines a number of formerly separate, related products, some of which are still optional. z/OS has the attributes of modern operating systems but also retains much of the older functionality that originated in the 1960s and is still in regular use—z/OS is designed for backward compatibility.

==Major characteristics==

z/OS supports stable mainframe facilities such as CICS, COBOL, IMS, PL/I, IBM Db2, RACF, SNA, IBM MQ, record-oriented data access methods, REXX, CLIST, SMP/E, JCL, TSO/E, and ISPF, among others.

z/OS also ships with a 64-bit Java runtime, C/C++ compiler based on the LLVM open-source Clang infrastructure, and UNIX (Single UNIX Specification) APIs and applications through UNIX System Services – The Open Group certifies z/OS as a compliant UNIX operating system – with UNIX/Linux-style hierarchical HFS and zFS file systems. These compatibilities make z/OS capable of running a range of commercial and open-source software. z/OS can communicate directly via TCP/IP, including IPv6, and includes standard HTTP servers (one from Lotus, the other Apache-derived) along with other common services such as SSH, FTP, NFS, and CIFS/SMB. z/OS is designed for high quality of service (QoS), even within a single operating system instance, and has built-in Parallel Sysplex clustering capability.

z/OS has a Workload Manager (WLM) and dispatcher which automatically manages numerous concurrently hosted units of work running in separate key-protected address spaces according to dynamically adjustable goals. This capability inherently supports multi-tenancy within a single operating system image. However, modern IBM mainframes also offer two additional levels of virtualization: LPARs and (optionally) z/VM.

From its inception z/OS has had tri-modal addressing (24-bit, 31-bit, and 64-bit). Up through Version 1.5, z/OS itself could start in either 31-bit ESA/390 or 64-bit z/Architecture mode, so it could function on older hardware, albeit without the ability to run 64-bit applications on those machines. (Only the newer z/Architecture hardware manufactured starting in the year 2000 can run 64-bit code.) IBM support for z/OS 1.5 ended on March 31, 2007, and since then, z/OS is supported only on z/Architecture mainframes and runs exclusively in 64-bit mode. Application programmers can still use any addressing mode: all applications, regardless of their addressing mode(s), can coexist without modification, and IBM maintains a commitment to tri-modal backward compatibility. However, increasing numbers of middleware products and applications, such as DB2 Version 8 and above, now require and exploit 64-bit addressing.

IBM markets z/OS as its flagship operating system, suited for continuous, high-volume operation with high security and stability.

z/OS is available under standard license pricing and via IBM Z New Application License Charges (zNALC) and &quot;IBM Z Solution Edition&quot;, two lower-priced offerings aimed at supporting newer applications (&quot;new workloads&quot;). U.S. standard commercial z/OS pricing starts at about US$125 per month, including support, for the smallest zNALC installation running the base z/OS product plus a typical set of optional z/OS features.

z/OS introduced Variable Workload License Charges (VWLC) and Entry Workload License Charges (EWLC) which are sub-capacity billing options. VWLC and EWLC customers only pay for peak monthly z/OS usage, not for full machine capacity as with the previous OS/390 operating system. VWLC and EWLC are also available for most IBM software products running on z/OS, and their peaks are separately calculated but can never exceed the z/OS peak. To be eligible for sub-capacity licensing, a z/OS customer must be running in 64-bit mode (which requires z/Architecture hardware), must have eliminated OS/390 from the system, and must e-mail IBM monthly sub-capacity reports. Sub-capacity billing substantially reduces software charges for most IBM mainframe customers. Advanced Workload License Charges (AWLC) is the successor to VWLC on mainframe models starting with the zEnterprise 196, and EAWLC is an option on zEnterprise 114 models. AWLC and EAWLC offer further sub-capacity discounts.

==Other features==

===64-bit memory support===
z/OS supports 64-bit addresses for both virtual and real addresses.
Within each address space, z/OS typically permits the placement of only data, not code, above the 2 GB &quot;bar&quot;. z/OS enforces this distinction primarily for performance reasons. There are no architectural impediments to allowing more than 2 GB of application code per address space. IBM has started to allow Java code running on z/OS to execute above the 2 GB bar, again for performance reasons.

Starting with z/OS version 2 release 3, code may be placed and executed above the 2 GB &quot;bar&quot;. However, very few z/OS services may be invoked from above the &quot;bar&quot;.

Memory is obtained as &quot;Large Memory Objects&quot; in multiples of 1 MB (with the expectation that applications and middleware will manage memory allocation within these large pieces). There are three types of large memory objects:

* Unshared – where only the creating address space can access the memory.
* Shared – where the creating address space can give access to specific other address spaces.
* Common – where all address spaces can access the memory. (This type was introduced in z/OS Release 10.)

===z/OS Encryption Readiness Technology (zERT)===
z/OS Encryption Readiness Technology (zERT) monitors, records, and reports details of z/OS cryptographic network protection. It is a feature of z/OS V2R3 (and later releases) Communications Server component.

====zERT discovery====

With zERT, the TCP/IP stack acts as a focal point in collecting and reporting the cryptographic security attributes of IPv4 and IPv6 application traffic that is protected using the TLS/SSL, SSH and IPSec cryptographic network security protocols. The collected connection level data is written to SMF in new SMF 119 subtype 11 records for analysis.

====zERT aggregation====

In certain environments, the volume of SMF 119 subtype 11 records can be large. The zERT aggregation function provides an alternative SMF view of the collected security session data. This alternate view is written in the form of new SMF 119 subtype 12 records that summarize the use of security sessions by many application connections over time and which are written at the end of each SMF interval. This alternate view condenses the volume of SMF record data while still providing all the critical security information.

====IBM zERT Network Analyzer====

z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF) is enhanced to provide a plug-in named IBM zERT Network Analyzer. IBM zERT Network Analyzer is a web-based graphical user interface that z/OS network security administrators can use to analyze and report on data reported in zERT Summary records. With the zERT Network Analyzer, a z/OS network security administrator (typically a systems programmer with responsibility over z/OS Communications Server) can import SMF zERT summary records into a Db2 for z/OS database and then build and run custom queries against that data.

===Generation Data Group===
The z/OS Generation Data Group (GDG) is a description of how many generations of a file are to be kept and at what age a generation will be deleted. Whenever a new generation is created, the system checks whether one or more obsolete generations are to be deleted.

The purpose of GDGs is to automate archival, using the command language JCL, the file name given is generic. When DSN appears, the GDG name appears along with the history number, where

(0) is the most recent version

(-1), (-2), ... are previous generations

(+1) a new generation (see DD)

Another use of GDGs is to be able to address all generations simultaneously within a JCL script without having to know the number of currently available generations. To do this, you have to omit the parentheses and the generation number in the JCL when specifying the dataset.

====Example====
Creation of a standard GDG for five safety scopes, each at least 35 days old:

//STEP1 EXEC PGM=IDCAMS
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSIN DD *
DEFINE GDG (NAME(&#x27;DB2.FULLCOPY.DSNDB04.TSTEST&#x27;) LIMIT(5) SCRATCH FOR(35))


Delete a standard GDG:

//STEP3 EXEC PGM=IDCAMS
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSIN DD *
DELETE DB2.FULLCOPY.DSNDB04.TSTEST GDG FORCE

=== Operational data collection and analysis ===
Operational data is data that z/OS system produces when it runs. This data indicates the health of the system and can be used to identify sources of performance and availability issues in the system. IBM Z Operational Log and Data Analytics and IBM Z Anomaly Analytics with Watson collect IT operational data from z/OS systems, analyze and provide insights about the operational data.

IBM Z Operational Log and Data Analytics collects IT operational data from z/OS systems, transforms it to a consumable format, and streams it to third-party enterprise analytics platforms like the Elastic Stack and Splunk, or to the included operational data analysis platform. The included insights can help to visualize and search operational data to help identify the cause of operational issues.

IBM Z Anomaly Analytics with Watson collects IT operational data from z/OS systems, uses historical IBM Z metric and log data to build a model of normal operational behavior, then analyzes real-time operational data through comparison with the model of normal operations to detect anomalous behavior, and notifies IT operations of the anomalous behavior to identify incidents that might lead to business disruption.

==== Operational data types ====
IBM Z Operational Log and Data Analytics collects and analyzes both structured and unstructured data, including the following types of operational data:

* System Management Facilities (SMF) data
* Log data from the following sources:
** Job log, the output which is written to a data definition (DD) by a running job
** z/OS UNIX log file, including the UNIX System Services system log (syslogd)
** Entry-sequenced Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM) cluster
** z/OS system log (SYSLOG)
** IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS messages
** IBM WebSphere Application Server for z/OS High Performance Extensible Logging (HPEL) log
** z/OS Resource Measurement Facility (RMF) Monitor III reports
* User application data, the operational data from users&#x27; own applications

IBM Z Anomaly Analytics with Watson collects data from multiple IBM Z systems and subsystems, including IBM Db2 for z/OS, IBM CICS Transaction Server for z/OS and IBM MQ for z/OS. The following types of operational data are collected: 
* System Management Facilities (SMF) data
* z/OS system log (SYSLOG)

<doc id="39124" wikidata="Q436097" url="?curid=39124" title="Aloysius Lilius">
<text>Aloysius Lilius ( 1510 – 1576), also variously referred to as Luigi Lilio or Luigi Giglio, was an Italian physician, astronomer, philosopher and chronologist, and also the &quot;primary author&quot; who provided the proposal that (after modifications) became the basis of the Gregorian Calendar reform of 1582.

The crater Lilius on the Moon is named after him, as is the asteroid 2346 Lilio. In computer science, the Lilian date is the number of days since the adoption of the Gregorian calendar on 15 October 1582.

==Life and work==
Not much is known about the early life of Lilius/Lilio/Giglio. It is known that he came from the comune of Cirò in the province of Crotone, in the Calabria region of Italy. He studied medicine and astronomy in Naples, after which he served Count Carafa. He settled in Verona and died in 1576. Although he was still alive at the time when his proposal was presented at Rome, it does not seem that he made the presentation; it was handled by his brother Antonio, also a physician and astronomer.

He is primarily known as the inventor of the Gregorian Calendar: he wrote the proposal on which (after modifications) the calendar reform was based. Lilio&#x27;s brother Antonio presented the manuscript to Pope Gregory XIII; it was passed to the calendar reform commission in 1575. The commission issued a printed summary entitled (Compendium of a New Plan for the Restitution of the Calendar), printed in 1577 and circulated within the Roman Catholic world in early 1578 as a consultation document. Lilio&#x27;s manuscript itself is not known to have survived; the printed &quot;Compendium&quot; is the nearest known source for the details it contained.

The processes of consultation and deliberation meant that the reform to the calendar did not occur until 1582, six years after the death of Luigi Lilio in 1576. The reform had by then received some modifications in points of detail by the reform commission, in which one of the leading members was Christopher Clavius, who afterwards wrote defences and an explanation of the reformed calendar, including an emphatic acknowledgement of Lilio&#x27;s work, especially for his provision of a useful reform for the lunar cycle: &quot;We owe much gratitude and praise to Luigi Giglio who contrived such an ingenious Cycle of Epacts which, inserted in the calendar, always shows the new moon and so can be easily adapted to any length of the year, if only at the right moments the due adjustment is applied.&quot; The papal bull () was issued on 24 February 1582 (year 1581 in Florentine Easter-based reckoning), ordering Catholic clergy to adopt the new calendar, and exhorting all Catholic sovereigns to do the same.

The year 2010 was the 500th year since the Lilius&#x27; birth; several activities were organized by Italian astronomers in order to recognize the great work performed by him. In particular, in Torretta di Crucoli (Crotone, Italy), a new astronomical group was created and dedicated to Luigi Lilio.

<text>The Times is a British daily national newspaper based in London. It began in 1785 under the title The Daily Universal Register, adopting its modern name on 1 January 1788. &quot;The Times&quot; and its sister paper &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; (founded in 1821), are published by Times Media, since 1981 a subsidiary of News UK, in turn wholly owned by News Corp. &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; were founded independently and have had common ownership only since 1966. It is considered a newspaper of record in the UK. 

&quot;The Times&quot; was the first newspaper to bear that name, inspiring numerous other papers around the world. In countries where these other titles are popular, the newspaper is often referred to as or , although the newspaper is of national scope and distribution.

&quot;The Times&quot; had an average daily circulation of 365,880 in March 2020; in the same period, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; had an average weekly circulation of 647,622. The two newspapers also had 304,000 digital-only paid subscribers as of June 2019. An American edition of &quot;The Times&quot; has been published since 6 June 2006. A complete historical file of the digitised paper, up to 2019, is available online from Gale Cengage Learning. The political position of &quot;The Times&quot; is considered to be centre-right.

==History==
===1785 to 1890=== 

&quot;The Times&quot; was founded by publisher John Walter (1738–1812) on 1 January 1785 as &quot;The Daily Universal Register,&quot; with Walter in the role of editor. Walter had lost his job by the end of 1784 after the insurance company for which he worked went bankrupt due to losses from a Jamaican hurricane. Unemployed, Walter began a new business venture. At that time, Henry Johnson invented the logography, a new typography that was reputedly faster and more precise (although three years later, it was proved less efficient than advertised). Walter bought the logography&#x27;s patent and, with it, opened a printing house to produce books. The first publication of &quot;The Daily Universal Register&quot; was on 1 January 1785. Walter changed the title after 940 editions on 1 January 1788 to &quot;The Times&quot;. In 1803, Walter handed ownership and editorship to his son of the same name. Walter Sr&#x27;s pioneering efforts to obtain Continental news, especially from France, helped build the paper&#x27;s reputation among policy makers and financiers, in spite of a sixteen-month incarceration in Newgate Prison for libels printed in &quot;The Times&quot;.

&quot;The Times&quot; used contributions from significant figures in the fields of politics, science, literature, and the arts to build its reputation. For much of its early life, the profits of &quot;The Times&quot; were very large and the competition minimal, so it could pay far better than its rivals for information or writers. Beginning in 1814, the paper was printed on the new steam-driven cylinder press developed by Friedrich Koenig (1774–1833). In 1815, &quot;The Times&quot; had a circulation of 5,000.

Thomas Barnes was appointed general editor in 1817. In the same year, the paper&#x27;s printer, James Lawson, died and passed the business onto his son, John Joseph Lawson (1802–1852). Under the editorship of Barnes and his successor in 1841, John Thadeus Delane, the influence of &quot;The Times&quot; rose to great heights, especially in politics and amongst the City of London. Peter Fraser and Edward Sterling were two noted journalists, and gained for &quot;The Times&quot; the pompous/satirical nickname &#x27;The Thunderer&#x27; (from &quot;We thundered out the other day an article on social and political reform.&quot;). The increased circulation and influence of the paper were based in part to its early adoption of the steam-driven rotary printing press. Distribution via steam trains to rapidly growing concentrations of urban populations helped ensure the profitability of the paper and its growing influence.
&quot;The Times&quot; was one of the first newspapers to send war correspondents to cover particular conflicts. William Howard Russell, the paper&#x27;s correspondent with the army in the Crimean War, was immensely influential with his dispatches back to England.

===1890 to 1981===
&quot;The Times&quot; faced financial failure in 1890 under Arthur Fraser Walter, but it was rescued by an energetic editor, Charles Frederic Moberly Bell. During his tenure (1890–1911), &quot;The Times&quot; became associated with selling the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; using aggressive American marketing methods introduced by Horace Everett Hooper and his advertising executive, Henry Haxton. Due to legal fights between the &quot;Britannica&#x27;s&quot; two owners, Hooper and Walter Montgomery Jackson, &quot;The Times&quot; severed its connection in 1908 and was bought by pioneering newspaper magnate, Alfred Harmsworth, later Lord Northcliffe.

In editorials published on 29 and 31 July 1914, Wickham Steed, the &quot;Times&#x27;s&quot; Chief Editor, argued that the British Empire should enter World War I. On 8 May 1920, also under the editorship of Steed, &quot;The Times&quot;, in an editorial, endorsed the anti-Semitic fabrication &quot;The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion&quot; as a genuine document, and called Jews the world&#x27;s greatest danger. In the leader entitled &quot;The Jewish Peril, a Disturbing Pamphlet: Call for Inquiry&quot;, Steed wrote about &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;: What are these &#x27;Protocols&#x27;? Are they authentic? If so, what malevolent assembly concocted these plans and gloated over their exposition? Are they forgery? If so, whence comes the uncanny note of prophecy, prophecy in part fulfilled, in part so far gone in the way of fulfillment?&quot;. The following year, when Philip Graves, the Constantinople (modern Istanbul) correspondent of &quot;The Times&quot;, exposed &quot;The Protocols&quot; as a forgery, &quot;The Times&quot; retracted the editorial of the previous year.

In 1922, John Jacob Astor, son of the 1st Viscount Astor, bought &quot;The Times&quot; from the Northcliffe estate. The paper gained a measure of notoriety in the 1930s with its advocacy of German appeasement; editor Geoffrey Dawson was closely allied with government supporters of appeasement, most notably Neville Chamberlain. Candid news reports by Norman Ebbut from Berlin that warned of Nazi warmongering were rewritten in London to support the appeasement policy.

Kim Philby, a double agent with primary allegiance to the Soviet Union, was a correspondent for the newspaper in Spain during the Spanish Civil War of the late 1930s. Philby was admired for his courage in obtaining high-quality reporting from the front lines of the bloody conflict. He later joined British Military Intelligence (MI6) during World War II, was promoted into senior positions after the war ended, and defected to the Soviet Union when discovery was inevitable in 1963.
Between 1941 and 1946, the left-wing British historian E. H. Carr was assistant editor. Carr was well known for the strongly pro-Soviet tone of his editorials. In December 1944, when fighting broke out in Athens between the Greek Communist ELAS and the British Army, Carr in a &quot;Times&quot; leader sided with the Communists, leading Winston Churchill to condemn him and the article in a speech to the House of Commons. As a result of Carr&#x27;s editorial, &quot;The Times&quot; became popularly known during that stage of World War II as &quot;the threepenny &quot;Daily Worker&quot;&quot; (the price of the Communist Party&#x27;s &quot;Daily Worker&quot; being one penny).
On 3 May 1966, it resumed printing news on the front page; previously, the front page had been given over to small advertisements, usually of interest to the moneyed classes in British society. Also in 1966, the Royal Arms, which had been a feature of the newspaper&#x27;s masthead since its inception, was abandoned. In the same year, members of the Astor family sold the paper to Canadian publishing magnate Roy Thomson. His Thomson Corporation brought it under the same ownership as &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; to form Times Newspapers Limited.

An industrial dispute prompted the management to shut down the paper for nearly a year, from 1 December 1978 to 12 November 1979.

The Thomson Corporation management was struggling to run the business due to the 1979 energy crisis and union demands. Management sought a buyer who was in a position to guarantee the survival of both titles, had the resources, and was committed to funding the introduction of modern printing methods.

Several suitors appeared, including Robert Maxwell, Tiny Rowland and Lord Rothermere; however, only one buyer was in a position to meet the full Thomson remit, Australian media magnate Rupert Murdoch. Robert Holmes à Court, another Australian magnate, had previously tried to buy &quot;The Times&quot; in 1980.

===From 1981===
In 1981, &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; were bought from Thomson by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News International. The acquisition followed three weeks of intensive bargaining with the unions by company negotiators John Collier and Bill O&#x27;Neill. Murdoch gave legal undertakings to maintain separate journalism resources for the two titles. The Royal Arms were reintroduced to the masthead at about this time, but whereas previously it had been that of the reigning monarch, it would now be that of the House of Hanover, who were on the throne when the newspaper was founded.

After 14 years as editor, William Rees-Mogg resigned upon completion of the change of ownership. Murdoch began to make his mark on the paper by appointing Harold Evans as his replacement. One of his most important changes was the introduction of new technology and efficiency measures. Between March 1981 and May 1982, following agreement with print unions, the hot-metal Linotype printing process used to print &quot;The Times&quot; since the 19th century was phased out and replaced by computer input and photocomposition. &quot;The Times&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; were able to reduce their print room staff by half as a result. However, direct input of text by journalists (&quot;single-stroke&quot; input) was still not achieved, and this was to remain an interim measure until the Wapping dispute of 1986, when &quot;The Times&quot; moved from New Printing House Square in Gray&#x27;s Inn Road (near Fleet Street) to new offices in Wapping.

Robert Fisk, seven times British International Journalist of the Year, resigned as foreign correspondent in 1988 over what he saw as &quot;political censorship&quot; of his article on the shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 in July 1988. He wrote in detail about his reasons for resigning from the paper due to meddling with his stories, and the paper&#x27;s pro-Israel stance.

In June 1990, &quot;The Times&quot; ceased its policy of using courtesy titles (&quot;Mr&quot;, &quot;Mrs&quot;, or &quot;Miss&quot; prefixes) for living persons before full names on the first reference, but it continues to use them before surnames on subsequent references. In 1992, it accepted the use of &quot;Ms&quot; for unmarried women &quot;if they express a preference.&quot;

In November 2003, News International began producing the newspaper in both broadsheet and tabloid sizes. Over the next year, the broadsheet edition was withdrawn from Northern Ireland, Scotland, and the West Country. Since 1 November 2004, the paper has been printed solely in tabloid format.

On 6 June 2005, &quot;The Times&quot; redesigned its Letters page, dropping the practice of printing correspondents&#x27; full postal addresses. Published letters were long regarded as one of the paper&#x27;s key constituents. According to its leading article &quot;From Our Own Correspondents&quot;, the reason for the removal of full postal addresses was to fit more letters onto the page.

In a 2007 meeting with the House of Lords Select Committee on Communications, which was investigating media ownership and the news, Murdoch stated that the law and the independent board prevented him from exercising editorial control.

In May 2008, printing of &quot;The Times&quot; switched from Wapping to new plants at Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire, and Merseyside and Glasgow, enabling the paper to be produced with full colour on every page for the first time.

On 26 July 2012, to coincide with the official start of the London 2012 Olympics and the issuing of a series of souvenir front covers, &quot;The Times&quot; added the suffix &quot;of London&quot; to its masthead.

In March 2016, the paper dropped its rolling digital coverage for a series of &#x27;editions&#x27; of the paper at 9am, midday, and 5pm on weekdays. The change also saw a redesign of the paper&#x27;s app for smartphones and tablets.

In April 2018, IPSO upheld a complaint against &quot;The Times&quot; for its report of a court hearing in a Tower Hamlets fostering case.

In April 2019, culture secretary Jeremy Wright said he was minded to allow a request by News UK to relax the legal undertakings given in 1981 to maintain separate journalism resources for &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

In 2019, IPSO upheld complaints against &quot;The Times&quot; over their article &quot;GPS data shows container visited trafficking hotspot&quot;, and for three articles as part of a series on pollution in Britain&#x27;s waterways: &quot;No river safe for bathing&quot;, &quot;Filthy Business&quot;, and &quot;Behind the story&quot;. IPSO also upheld complaints in 2019 against articles headlined &quot;Funding secret of scientists against hunt trophy ban,&quot; and &quot;Britons lose out to rush of foreign medical students.&quot;

In 2019, &quot;The Times&quot; published an article about Imam Abdullah Patel that wrongly claimed Patel had blamed Israel for the 2003 murder of a British police officer by a terror suspect in Manchester. The story also wrongly claimed that Patel ran a primary school that had been criticised by Ofsted for segregating parents at events, which Ofsted said was contrary to &quot;British democratic principles.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; settled Patel&#x27;s defamation claim by issuing an apology and offering to pay damages and legal costs. Patel&#x27;s solicitor, Zillur Rahman, said the case &quot;highlights the shocking level of journalism to which the Muslim community are often subject&quot;.

In 2019, &quot;The Times&quot; published an article titled &quot;Female Circumcision is like clipping a nail, claimed speaker&quot;. The article featured a photo of Sultan Choudhury beside the headline, leading some readers to incorrectly infer that Choudhury had made the comment. Choudhury lodged a complaint with the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) and sued &quot;The Times&quot; for libel. In 2020, &quot;The Times&quot; issued an apology, amended its article, and agreed to pay Choudhury damages and legal costs. Choudhury&#x27;s solicitor, Nishtar Saleem, said, &quot;This is another example of irresponsible journalism. Publishing sensational excerpts on a &#x27;free site&#x27; while concealing the full article behind a paywall is a dangerous game&quot;.

In December 2020, Cage and Moazzam Begg received damages of £30,000 plus costs in a libel case they had brought against &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper. In June 2020, a report in &quot;The Times&quot; suggested that Cage and Begg were supporting a man who had been arrested in relation to a knife attack in Reading in which three men were murdered. &quot;The Times&quot; report also suggested that Cage and Begg were excusing the actions of the accused man by mentioning mistakes made by the police and others. In addition to paying damages, &quot;The Times&quot; printed an apology. Cage stated that the damages amount would be used to &quot;expose state-sponsored Islamophobia and those complicit with it in the press. ... The Murdoch press empire has actively supported xenophobic elements and undermined principles of open society and accountability. ... We will continue to shine a light on war criminals and torture apologists and press barons who fan the flames of hate&quot;.

Long described as Britain’s &quot;newspaper of record&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; was forced to correct a false article in January 2025 about electric vehicle (EV) sales, following successful complaint to IPSO.

==Content==
&quot;The Times&quot; features news for the first half of the paper; the Opinion/Comment section begins after the first news section, with world news normally following this. The Register, which contains obituaries, a Court &amp; Social section, and related material, follows the business pages on the centre spread. The sports section is at the end of the main paper.

===&quot;Times2&quot;===
&quot;The Times&quot;″ main supplement, every day, is &quot;times2&quot;, featuring various columns. It was discontinued in early March 2010, but reintroduced on 12 October 2010 after discontinuation was criticised. Its regular features include a puzzles section called &quot;Mind Games&quot;. Its previous incarnation began on 5 September 2005, before which it was called &quot;T2&quot; and previously &quot;Times 2&quot;. The supplement contains arts and lifestyle features, TV and radio listings, and theatre reviews. The newspaper employs Richard Morrison as its classical music critic.

===&quot;The Game&quot;===
&quot;The Game&quot; is included in the newspaper on Mondays, and details all the weekend&#x27;s football activity (Premier League and Football League Championship, League One and League Two.) The Scottish edition of &quot;The Game&quot; also includes results and analysis from Scottish Premier League games. During the FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euros, there is a daily supplement of The Game.

===Saturday supplements===
The Saturday edition of &quot;The Times&quot; contains a variety of supplements.

Beginning on 5 July 2003 (issue 67807) and ending after 17 January 2009 (issue 69535), Saturday issues of &quot;The Times&quot; came with a weekly magazine called &quot;TheKnowledge&quot; containing listings for the upcoming week (from that Saturday to the next Friday) compiled by PA Arts &amp; Leisure (part of Press Association Ltd). Its taglines include &quot;Your pocket guide to what&#x27;s on in London&quot;, &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest City, Cut Down To Size&quot;, and &quot;Your critical guide to the cultural week&quot;.

These supplements were relaunched on 24 January 2009 as: &quot;Sport&quot;, &quot;Saturday Review&quot; (arts, books, TV listings, and ideas), &quot;Weekend&quot; (including travel and lifestyle features), &quot;Playlist&quot; (an entertainment listings guide), and &quot;The Times Magazine&quot; (columns on various topics).

====&quot;The Times Magazine&quot;====
&quot;The Times Magazine&quot; features columns touching on various subjects such as celebrities, fashion and beauty, food and drink, homes and gardens, or simply writers&#x27; anecdotes. Notable contributors include Giles Coren, Food and Drink Writer of the Year in 2005 and Nadiya Hussain, winner of &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot;.

===Online presence===

&quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; have had an online presence since 1996, originally at &quot;the-times.co.uk&quot; and &quot;sunday-times.co.uk&quot;, and later at &quot;timesonline.co.uk&quot;. There are now two websites: &quot;thetimes.co.uk&quot; is aimed at daily readers, and the &quot;thesundaytimes.co.uk&quot; site provides weekly magazine-like content. There are also iPad and Android editions of both newspapers. Since July 2010, News UK has required readers who do not subscribe to the print edition to pay £2 per week to read &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; online.

Visits to the websites have decreased by 87% since the paywall was introduced, from 21 million unique users per month to 2.7 million. In April 2009, the &quot;timesonline&quot; site had a readership of 750,000 readers per day. In October 2011, there were around 111,000 subscribers to &quot;The Times&quot;″ digital products. A Reuters Institute survey in 2021 put the number of digital subscribers at around 400,000, and ranked &quot;The Times&quot; as having the sixth highest trust rating out of 13 different outlets polled.

The Times Digital Archive is available by subscription.

==Readership==
&quot;The Times&quot; had a circulation of 70,405 on 5 September 1870, due to a reduction in price and the Franco-Prussian War. &quot;The Times&quot; had a circulation of 150,000 in March 1914, due to a reduction in price. &quot;The Times&quot; had a circulation of 248,338 in 1958, a circulation of 408,300 in 1968, and a circulation of 295,863 in 1978. At the time of Harold Evans&#x27; appointment as editor in 1981, &quot;The Times&quot; had an average daily sale of 282,000 copies in comparison to the 1.4 million daily sales of its traditional rival, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. By 1988, The Times had a circulation of 443,462. By November 2005, &quot;The Times&quot; sold an average of 691,283 copies per day, the second-highest of any British &quot;quality&quot; newspaper (after &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, which had a circulation of 903,405 copies in the period), and the highest in terms of full-rate sales. By March 2014, average daily circulation of &quot;The Times&quot; had fallen to 394,448 copies, compared to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s 523,048, with the two retaining respectively the second-highest and highest circulations among British &quot;quality&quot; newspapers. In contrast, &quot;The Sun&quot;, the highest-selling &quot;tabloid&quot; daily newspaper in the United Kingdom, sold an average of 2,069,809 copies in March 2014, and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, the highest-selling &quot;middle market&quot; British daily newspaper, sold an average of 1,708,006 copies in the period.

&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; has significantly higher circulation than &quot;The Times&quot;, and sometimes outsells &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;. In January 2019, &quot;The Times&quot; had a circulation of 417,298 and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; 712,291.

In a 2009 national readership survey, &quot;The Times&quot; was found to have the highest number of ABC1 25–44 readers and the largest number of readers in London of any of the &quot;quality&quot; papers.

==Typeface==
&quot;The Times&quot; is the originator of the widely used Times New Roman typeface, originally developed by Stanley Morison of &quot;The Times&quot; in collaboration with Monotype Imaging for its legibility in low-tech printing. In November 2006, &quot;The Times&quot; began printing headlines in a new typeface, Times Modern. &quot;The Times&quot; was printed in broadsheet format for 219 years, but switched to compact size in 2004 in an attempt to appeal more to younger readers and commuters using public transport. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; remains a broadsheet.


In 1908, &quot;The Times&quot; started using the &quot;Monotype Modern&quot; typeface.

&quot;The Times&quot; commissioned the serif typeface &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, created by Victor Lardent at the English branch of Monotype, in 1931. It was commissioned after Stanley Morison had written an article criticising &quot;The Times&quot; for being badly printed and typographically antiquated. Victor Lardent, an artist from &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27; advertising department, created the typeface under Morison&#x27;s supervision. Morison used an older typeface named Plantin as the basis for his design but made revisions for legibility and economy of space. &quot;Times New Roman&quot; made its debut in the issue of 3 October 1932. After one year, the design was released for commercial sale. &quot;The Times&quot; stayed with &quot;Times New Roman&quot; for 40 years, but new production techniques and the format change from broadsheet to tabloid in 2004 have caused the newspaper to switch typeface five times since 1972. However, all the new typeface have been variants of the original New Roman type:
* &quot;Times Europa&quot; was designed by Walter Tracy in 1972 for &quot;The Times&quot;, as a sturdier alternative to the Times font family, designed for the demands of faster printing presses and cheaper paper. The typeface features more open counter spaces.
* &quot;Times Roman&quot; replaced &quot;Times Europa&quot; on 30 August 1982.
* &quot;Times Millennium&quot; was made in 1991, drawn by Gunnlaugur Briem on the instructions of Aurobind Patel, composing manager of News International.
* &quot;Times Classic&quot; first appeared in 2001. Designed as an economical face by the British-type team of Dave Farey and Richard Dawson, it took advantage of the new PC-based publishing system at the newspaper while obviating the production shortcomings of its predecessor, &quot;Times Millennium&quot;. The new typeface included 120 letters per font. Initially, the family comprised ten fonts, but a condensed version was added in 2004.
* &quot;Times Modern&quot; was unveiled on 20 November 2006, as the successor of &quot;Times Classic&quot;. Designed for improving legibility in smaller font sizes, it uses 45-degree angled bracket serifs. Ben Preston, the deputy editor of &quot;The Times&quot;, and designer Neville Brody led Research Studios in creating the typeface, which Elsner + Flake published as EF Times Modern.

==Political alignment==
Historically, the paper was not overtly pro-Tory or Whig, but has been a long time bastion of the British Establishment and Empire. In 1959, the historian of journalism Allan Nevins analysed the importance of &quot;The Times&quot; in shaping the views of events of London&#x27;s elite, writing:
For much more than a century &quot;The Times&quot; has been an integral and important part of the political structure of Great Britain. Its news and its editorial comment have in general been carefully coordinated, and have at most times been handled with an earnest sense of responsibility. While the paper has admitted some trivia to its columns, its whole emphasis has been on important public affairs treated with an eye to the best interests of Britain. To guide this treatment, the editors have for long periods been in close touch with 10 Downing Street.

&quot;The Times&quot; adopted a stance described as &quot;peculiarly detached&quot; at the 1945 general election; although it was increasingly critical of the Conservative Party&#x27;s campaign, it did not advocate a vote for any one party. However, the newspaper reverted to the Conservatives for the next election five years later. It supported the Conservatives for the subsequent three elections, followed by support for both the Conservatives and the Liberal Party for the next five elections, expressly supporting a Con-Lib coalition in 1974. The paper then backed the Conservatives solidly until 1997, when it declined to make any party endorsement but supported individual (primarily Eurosceptic) candidates.

For the 2001 general election, &quot;The Times&quot; declared its support for Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour government, which was re-elected by a landslide (although not as large as in 1997). It supported Labour again in 2005, when Labour achieved a third successive win, though with a reduced majority. In 2004, according to MORI, the voting intentions of its readership were 40% for the Conservative Party, 29% for the Liberal Democrats, and 26% for Labour. For the 2010 general election, the newspaper declared its support for the Conservatives once again; the election ended in the Tories taking the most votes and seats but having to form a coalition with the Liberal Democrats in order to form a government as they had failed to gain an overall majority.

Its changes in political alignment make it the most varied newspaper in terms of political support in British history. Some columnists in &quot;The Times&quot; are connected to the Conservative Party, such as Daniel Finkelstein, Tim Montgomerie, Matthew Parris, and Matt Ridley, but there are also columnists connected to the Labour Party, such as David Aaronovitch and Jenni Russell.

&quot;The Times&quot; occasionally makes endorsements for foreign elections. In November 2012, it endorsed a second term for Democrat Barack Obama, although it also expressed reservations about his foreign policy.

During the 2019 Conservative leadership election, &quot;The Times&quot; endorsed Boris Johnson and subsequently endorsed the Conservative Party in the general election of that year.

In 2022, Tony Gallagher was appointed to replace John Witherow, who had served nine years as editor. A former &quot;Sun&quot; editor, Gallagher enthusiastically backed Brexit during the 2016 EU referendum. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Times&#x27; readership is split politically, with journalists at the outlet speculating on how Gallagher will shape the paper&#x27;s editorial line as the prospect of a Labour government became more likely (in 2024).&quot;

==Sponsorships==

&quot;The Times&quot;, along with the British Film Institute, sponsored the BFI London Film Festival from 2003 to 2009. It also sponsors the Cheltenham Literature Festival and the Asia House Festival of Asian Literature at Asia House, London.

&quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; (&quot;TLS&quot;) first appeared in 1902 as a supplement to &quot;The Times&quot;, becoming a separately paid-for weekly literature and society magazine in 1914. The &quot;TLS&quot; is owned and published by News International and co-operates closely with &quot;The Times&quot;, with its online version hosted on &quot;The Times&quot; website, and its editorial offices based in 1 London Bridge Street, London.

Between 1951 and 1966, &quot;The Times&quot; published a separately paid-for quarterly science review, &quot;The Times Science Review&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; started a new, free, monthly science magazine, &quot;Eureka&quot;, in October 2009. The magazine closed in October 2012.

&quot;The Times Review of Industry&quot; (which began in 1947) and &quot;Technology&quot; (which began in 1957) merged in March 1963 to become &quot;The Times Review of Industry &amp; Technology&quot;. From 1952, &quot;The Times Review of Industry&quot; included the &quot;London and Cambridge Economic Bulletin&quot;.

Times Atlases have been produced since 1895. The Collins Bartholomew imprint of HarperCollins Publishers is currently responsible for producing them. The flagship product is &quot;The Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World&quot;.

In 1971, &quot;The Times&quot; began publishing the &quot;Times Higher Education Supplement&quot; (now known as the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;) which focuses its coverage on tertiary education.

==Historical value==
In 1915, R P Farley said &quot;the files of the Times must be constantly studied&quot; as an authority for the political and social history of the English people during the period from the Reform Bill 1832 to the Education Act 1870 (1832 to 1870). From 1971 to 1973, John Joseph Bagley said &quot;The Times&quot; is &quot;valuable&quot; as a source of nineteenth-century English history and that the annual index to &quot;The Times&quot; is useful for the twentieth century. In 2003, Richard Krzys said &quot;The Times&quot; is very reliable as a source of history. In 2016, Denise Bates said &quot;The Times&quot; is &quot;indispensable&quot; as a source for historical events of national importance.

In 2019, James Oldham said &quot;The Times&quot; is an important source for nisi prius trials. In 2015, Johnston and Plummer said that &quot;The Times&quot; is an important source for music reviews.

==In popular culture==
In the dystopian future world of George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; has been transformed into an organ of the totalitarian ruling party. The book&#x27;s lead character, Winston Smith is employed to rewrite past issues of the newspaper for the Ministry of Truth.

Rex Stout&#x27;s fictional detective, Nero Wolfe is described as fond of solving the London &quot;Times&quot;″ crossword puzzle at his New York home, in preference to those of American papers.

In the James Bond series by Ian Fleming, James Bond reads &quot;The Times&quot;. As described by Fleming in &quot;From Russia, with Love,&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; was &quot;the only paper that Bond ever read.&quot;

<text>OS/390 is an IBM operating system for the System/390 IBM mainframe computers.

==Overview==
OS/390 was introduced in late 1995 in an effort to simplify the packaging and ordering for the key, entitled elements needed to complete a fully functional Multiple Virtual Storage (MVS) operating system package. These elements included, but were not limited to:

*Data Facility Storage Management Subsystem Data Facility Product (DFP)Provides access methods to enable I/O to, e.g., Direct access storage device subsystems, printers, tape; provides utilities and program management
*Job Entry Subsystem (JES)Provides the ability to submit batch work and manage print
*IBM Communications ServerProvides Virtual Telecommunications Access Method (VTAM) and TCP/IP communications protocols

An additional benefit of the OS/390 packaging concept was to improve reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) for the operating system, as the number of different combinations of elements that a customer could order and run was drastically reduced. This reduced the overall time required for customers to test and deploy the operating system in their environments, as well as reducing the number of customer-reported problems, errors (Authorized Program Analysis Reports and Program temporary fixes) arising from the variances in element levels.

In December 2001 IBM extended OS/390 to include support for 64-bit zSeries processors and added various other improvements, and the result is now named z/OS. IBM ended support for the older OS/390-branded versions in late 2004.

<doc id="39132" wikidata="Q3089703" url="?curid=39132" title="Faunus">
<text>In ancient Roman religion and myth, Faunus was the rustic god of the forest, plains and fields; when he made cattle fertile, he was called Inuus. He came to be equated in literature with the Greek god Pan, after which Romans depicted him as a horned god.

Faunus was one of the oldest Roman deities, known as the &quot;di indigetes&quot;. According to the epic poet Virgil, he was a legendary king of the Latins. His shade was consulted as a goddess of prophecy under the name of Fatuus, with oracles in the sacred grove of Tibur, around the well Albunea, and on the Aventine Hill in ancient Rome itself.

Marcus Terentius Varro asserted that the oracular responses were given in Saturnian verse. Faunus revealed the future in dreams and voices that were communicated to those who came to sleep in his precincts, lying on the fleeces of sacrificed lambs. Fowler (1899) suggested that &quot;Faunus&quot; is identical with &quot;Favonius&quot;, one of the Roman wind gods (compare the Anemoi).

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Faunus&quot; is generally thought to stem from Proto-Italic *&quot;fawe&quot; or &quot;*fawono&quot; (variant *&quot;fawōn(jo)&quot;), thus being cognate with Umbrian &quot;fons&quot;, &quot;foner&quot; (&#x27;merciful&#x27;). It may ultimately derive from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) &quot;*bʰh₂u-n&quot; (&#x27;favourable&#x27;), which also reflects Old Irish &quot;búan&quot; (&#x27;good, favourable, firm&#x27;) and Middle Welsh &quot;bun&quot; (&#x27;maiden, sweetheart&#x27;).

Another theory contends that Faunus is the Latin outcome of PIE *&quot;dhau-no-&quot; (&#x27;the strangler&#x27;, thus denoting the &#x27;wolf&#x27;), a proposition suggested by the fact that the two Luperci (&quot;wolf-men&quot;, from Latin &quot;lupus&quot;, &#x27;wolf&#x27;) are commonly treated as temporary priests of the god Faunus. If so, his name would be cognate with the Greek &quot;θαῦνον&quot; (a less common synonym of &quot;θηρίον&quot;, &#x27;wild animal&#x27;).

== Origin ==
Faunus may be of Indo-European origin and related to the Vedic god Rudra. It is believed that he was worshipped by traditional Roman farmers before becoming a nature deity.

==Consorts and family==
In fable Faunus appears as an old king of Latium, grandson of Saturnus, son of Picus, and father of Latinus by the nymph Marica (who was also sometimes Faunus&#x27; mother). After his death he is raised to the position of a tutelary deity of the land, for his many services to agriculture and cattle-breeding.

A goddess of like attributes, called Fauna and Fatua, was associated in his worship. She was regarded as his sister and wife. The female deity Bona Dea was often equated with Fauna.

As Pan was accompanied by the &quot;Paniskoi&quot;, or little Pans, so the existence of many Fauni was assumed besides the chief Faunus. Fauns are place-spirits (&quot;genii&quot;) of untamed woodland. Educated, Hellenizing Romans connected their fauns with the Greek satyrs, who were wild and orgiastic drunken followers of Dionysus, with a distinct origin.
== Conflation with Greek Pan ==
Faunus was naturally conflated with the Greek god Pan, who was a pastoral god of shepherds who was said to reside in Arcadia. 
With the increasing influence of Greek mythology on Roman mythology in the 3rd and 2nd centuries , the Romans identified their own deities with Greek ones in what was called &quot;interpretatio Romana&quot;.
However, the two deities were also considered separate by many; for instance, the epic poet Virgil, in his &quot;Aeneid&quot;, independently mentioned both Faunus and Pan.

Pan had always been depicted with horns whereas the original Roman Faunus was not. An indication of the cultural conflation of the two can be seen in many Roman depictions of Faunus that also began to display Faunus with horns.

==Festivals==
In Justin&#x27;s epitome, Faunus is identified with &quot;Lupercus&quot; (&quot;he who wards off the wolf&quot;), otherwise a priest of Faunus. Livy named Inuus as the god originally worshiped at the Lupercalia, 15 February, when his priests (&quot;Luperci&quot;) wore goat-skins and hit passers-by with goatskin whips.

Two festivals, called Faunalia, were celebrated in his honour—one on 13 February, in the temple of Faunus on the island in the Tiber, the other on 5 December, when the peasants brought him rustic offerings and amused themselves with dancing.
A euhemeristic account made Faunus a Latin king, son of Picus and Canens. He was then revered as the god Fatuus after his death, worshipped in a sacred forest outside what is now Tivoli, but had been known since Etruscan times as Tibur, the seat of the Tiburtine Sibyl. His numinous presence was recognized by wolf skins, with wreaths and goblets.

In Nonnos&#x27; &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, Faunus/Phaunos accompanied Dionysus when the god campaigned in India.

==Later worship==
Faunus was worshipped across the Roman Empire for many centuries. An example of this was a set of thirty-two 4th century spoons found near Thetford in England in 1979. They had been engraved with the name &quot;Faunus&quot;, and each had a different epithet after the god&#x27;s name. The spoons also bore Christian symbols, and it has been suggested that these were initially Christian but later taken and devoted to Faunus by pagans. The 4th century was a time of large scale Christianisation, and the discovery provides evidence that even during the decline of traditional Roman religion, the god Faunus was still worshipped. 

In Gaul, Faunus was identified with the Celtic Dusios.

<text>Pearl Harbour is a small harbour at the head of the Waiau River, in the town of Manapouri on the South Island of New Zealand.

The harbour and town are located at the south-east corner of Lake Manapouri. The name was given to the harbour soon after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in 1941.

Pearl Harbour is used mainly by ferry and water taxi operators transporting Meridian Energy staff across Lake Manapouri to the Manapouri Hydroelectric Power Station, on the West Arm of the lake. Ferries also carry tourists travelling to the power station and onwards to Doubtful Sound / Patea, located on the coast beyond the West Arm. It also provides easy access to Lake Manapouri for recreational boat users.

<text>Observations show that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, such that the velocity at which a distant galaxy recedes from the observer is continuously increasing with time. The accelerated expansion of the universe was discovered in 1998 by two independent projects, the Supernova Cosmology Project and the High-Z Supernova Search Team, which used distant type Ia supernovae to measure the acceleration. The idea was that as type Ia supernovae have almost the same intrinsic brightness (a standard candle), and since objects that are further away appear dimmer, the observed brightness of these supernovae can be used to measure the distance to them. The distance can then be compared to the supernovae&#x27;s cosmological redshift, which measures how much the universe has expanded since the supernova occurred; the Hubble law established that the further away an object is, the faster it is receding. The unexpected result was that objects in the universe are moving away from one another at an accelerating rate. Cosmologists at the time expected that recession velocity would always be decelerating, due to the gravitational attraction of the matter in the universe. Three members of these two groups have subsequently been awarded Nobel Prizes for their discovery. Confirmatory evidence has been found in baryon acoustic oscillations, and in analyses of the clustering of galaxies.

The accelerated expansion of the universe is thought to have begun since the universe entered its dark-energy-dominated era roughly 5 billion years ago.
Within the framework of general relativity, an accelerated expansion can be accounted for by a positive value of the cosmological constant , equivalent to the presence of a positive vacuum energy, dubbed &quot;dark energy&quot;. While there are alternative possible explanations, the description assuming dark energy (positive ) is used in the standard model of cosmology, which also includes cold dark matter (CDM) and is known as the Lambda-CDM model.

==Background==
In the decades since the detection of cosmic microwave background (CMB) in 1965, the Big Bang model has become the most accepted model explaining the evolution of our universe. The Friedmann equation defines how the energy in the universe drives its expansion.

:formula_1

where the pressure is defined by the cosmological model chosen. (see explanatory models)

Physicists at one time were so assured of the deceleration of the universe&#x27;s expansion that they introduced a so-called deceleration parameter . Recent observations indicate this deceleration parameter is negative.

===Relation to inflation===
According to the theory of cosmic inflation, the very early universe underwent a period of very rapid, quasi-exponential expansion. While the time-scale for this period of expansion was far shorter than that of the existing expansion, this was a period of accelerated expansion with some similarities to the current epoch.

===Technical definition===
The definition of &quot;accelerating expansion&quot; is that the second time derivative of the cosmic scale factor, formula_2, is positive, which is equivalent to the deceleration parameter, formula_3, being negative. However, note this does not imply that the Hubble parameter is increasing with time. Since the Hubble parameter is defined as formula_4, it follows from the definitions that the derivative of the Hubble parameter is given by

:formula_5

so the Hubble parameter is decreasing with time unless formula_6. Observations prefer formula_7, which implies that formula_2 is positive but formula_9 is negative. Essentially, this implies that the cosmic recession velocity of any one particular galaxy is increasing with time, but its velocity/distance ratio is still decreasing; thus different galaxies expanding across a sphere of fixed radius cross the sphere more slowly at later times.

It is seen from above that the case of &quot;zero acceleration/deceleration&quot; corresponds to formula_10 is a linear function of formula_11, formula_12, formula_13, and formula_14.

==Evidence for acceleration==
The rate of expansion of the universe can be analyzed using the magnitude-redshift relationship of astronomical objects using standard candles, or their distance-redshift relationship using standard rulers. Also a factor is the growth of large-scale structure, finding that the observed values of the cosmological parameters are best described by models which include an accelerating expansion.

===Supernova observation===
In 1998, the first evidence for acceleration came from the observation of Type Ia supernovae, which are exploding white dwarf stars that have exceeded their stability limit. Because they all have similar masses, their intrinsic luminosity can be standardized. Repeated imaging of selected areas of the sky is used to discover the supernovae, then follow-up observations give their peak brightness, which is converted into a quantity known as luminosity distance (see distance measures in cosmology for details). Spectral lines of their light can be used to determine their redshift.

For supernovae at redshift less than around 0.1, or light travel time less than 10 percent of the age of the universe, this gives a nearly linear distance–redshift relation due to Hubble&#x27;s law. At larger distances, since the expansion rate of the universe has changed over time, the distance-redshift relation deviates from linearity, and this deviation depends on how the expansion rate has changed over time. The full calculation requires computer integration of the Friedmann equation, but a simple derivation can be given as follows: the redshift directly gives the cosmic scale factor at the time the supernova exploded.

:formula_15

So a supernova with a measured redshift implies the universe was  =  of its present size when the supernova exploded. In the case of accelerated expansion, formula_2 is positive; therefore, formula_17 was smaller in the past than today. Thus, an accelerating universe took a longer time to expand from 2/3 to 1 times its present size, compared to a non-accelerating universe with constant formula_17 and the same present-day value of the Hubble constant. This results in a larger light-travel time, larger distance and fainter supernovae, which corresponds to the actual observations. Adam Riess &quot;et al.&quot; found that &quot;the distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia were, on average, 10% to 15% further than expected in a low mass density universe without a cosmological constant&quot;. This means that the measured high-redshift distances were too large, compared to nearby ones, for a decelerating universe.

Several researchers have questioned the majority opinion on the acceleration or the assumption of the &quot;cosmological principle&quot; (that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic). For example, a 2019 paper analyzed the Joint Light-curve Analysis catalog of Type Ia supernovas, containing ten times as many supernova as were used in the 1998 analyses, and concluded that there was little evidence for a &quot;monopole&quot;, that is, for an isotropic acceleration in all directions. See also the section on Alternate theories below.

===Baryon acoustic oscillations===

In the early universe before recombination and decoupling took place, photons and matter existed in a primordial plasma. Points of higher density in the photon-baryon plasma would contract, being compressed by gravity until the pressure became too large and they expanded again. This contraction and expansion created vibrations in the plasma analogous to sound waves. Since dark matter only interacts gravitationally, it stayed at the centre of the sound wave, the origin of the original overdensity. When decoupling occurred, approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang, photons separated from matter and were able to stream freely through the universe, creating the cosmic microwave background as we know it. This left shells of baryonic matter at a fixed radius from the overdensities of dark matter, a distance known as the sound horizon. As time passed and the universe expanded, it was at these inhomogeneities of matter density where galaxies started to form. So by looking at the distances at which galaxies at different redshifts tend to cluster, it is possible to determine a standard angular diameter distance and use that to compare to the distances predicted by different cosmological models.

Peaks have been found in the correlation function (the probability that two galaxies will be a certain distance apart) at , (where &quot;h&quot; is the dimensionless Hubble constant) indicating that this is the size of the sound horizon today, and by comparing this to the sound horizon at the time of decoupling (using the CMB), we can confirm the accelerated expansion of the universe.

===Clusters of galaxies===
Measuring the mass functions of galaxy clusters, which describe the number density of the clusters above a threshold mass, also provides evidence for dark energy . By comparing these mass functions at high and low redshifts to those predicted by different cosmological models, values for and are obtained which confirm a low matter density and a non-zero amount of dark energy.

===Age of the universe===

Given a cosmological model with certain values of the cosmological density parameters, it is possible to integrate the Friedmann equations and derive the age of the universe.

:formula_19

By comparing this to actual measured values of the cosmological parameters, we can confirm the validity of a model which is accelerating now, and had a slower expansion in the past.

===Gravitational waves as standard sirens===
Recent discoveries of gravitational waves through LIGO and VIRGO not only confirmed Einstein&#x27;s predictions but also opened a new window into the universe. These gravitational waves can work as sort of standard sirens to measure the expansion rate of the universe. Abbot et al. 2017 measured the Hubble constant value to be approximately 70 kilometres per second per megaparsec. The amplitudes of the strain &#x27;h&#x27; is dependent on the masses of the objects causing waves, distances from observation point and gravitational waves detection frequencies. The associated distance measures are dependent on the cosmological parameters like the Hubble Constant for nearby objects and will be dependent on other cosmological parameters like the dark energy density, matter density, etc. for distant sources.

==Explanatory models==
===Dark energy===

The most important property of dark energy is that it has negative pressure (repulsive action) which is distributed relatively homogeneously in space.

:formula_20

where is the speed of light and is the energy density. Different theories of dark energy suggest different values of , with for cosmic acceleration (this leads to a positive value of in the acceleration equation above).

The simplest explanation for dark energy is that it is a cosmological constant or vacuum energy; in this case . This leads to the Lambda-CDM model, which has generally been known as the Standard Model of Cosmology from 2003 through the present, since it is the simplest model in good agreement with a variety of recent observations. Riess &quot;et al.&quot; found that their results from supernova observations favoured expanding models with positive cosmological constant () and an accelerated expansion ().

===Phantom energy===

These observations allow the possibility of a cosmological model containing a dark energy component with equation of state . This phantom energy density would become infinite in finite time, causing such a huge gravitational repulsion that the universe would lose all structure and end in a Big Rip. For example, for and  =70 km·s−1·Mpc−1, the time remaining before the universe ends in this Big Rip is 22 billion years.

===Alternative theories===

There are many alternative explanations for the accelerating universe. Some examples are quintessence, a proposed form of dark energy with a non-constant state equation, whose density decreases with time. A negative mass cosmology does not assume that the mass density of the universe is positive (as is done in supernova observations), and instead finds a negative cosmological constant. Occam&#x27;s razor also suggests that this is the &#x27;more parsimonious hypothesis&#x27;. Dark fluid is an alternative explanation for accelerating expansion which attempts to unite dark matter and dark energy into a single framework. Alternatively, some authors have argued that the accelerated expansion of the universe could be due to a repulsive gravitational interaction of antimatter or a deviation of the gravitational laws from general relativity, such as massive gravity, meaning that gravitons themselves have mass. The measurement of the speed of gravity with the gravitational wave event GW170817 ruled out many modified gravity theories as alternative explanations to dark energy. Another type of model, the backreaction conjecture, was proposed by cosmologist Syksy Räsänen: the rate of expansion is not homogenous, but Earth is in a region where expansion is faster than the background. Inhomogeneities in the early universe cause the formation of walls and bubbles, where the inside of a bubble has less matter than on average. According to general relativity, space is less curved than on the walls, and thus appears to have more volume and a higher expansion rate. In the denser regions, the expansion is slowed by a higher gravitational attraction. Therefore, the inward collapse of the denser regions looks the same as an accelerating expansion of the bubbles, leading us to conclude that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion. The benefit is that it does not require any new physics such as dark energy. Räsänen does not consider the model likely, but without any falsification, it must remain a possibility. It would require rather large density fluctuations (20%) to work.

A final possibility is that dark energy is an illusion caused by some bias in measurements. For example, if we are located in an emptier-than-average region of space, the observed cosmic expansion rate could be mistaken for a variation in time, or acceleration. A different approach uses a cosmological extension of the equivalence principle to show how space might appear to be expanding more rapidly in the voids surrounding our local cluster. While weak, such effects considered cumulatively over billions of years could become significant, creating the illusion of cosmic acceleration, and making it appear as if we live in a Hubble bubble. Yet other possibilities are that the accelerated expansion of the universe is an illusion caused by the relative motion of us to the rest of the universe, or that the supernova sample size used wasn&#x27;t large enough.

==Consequences for the universe==

As the universe expands, the density of radiation and ordinary dark matter declines more quickly than the density of dark energy (see equation of state) and, eventually, dark energy dominates. Specifically, when the scale of the universe doubles, the density of matter is reduced by a factor of 8, but the density of dark energy is nearly unchanged (it is exactly constant if the dark energy is the cosmological constant).

In models where dark energy is the cosmological constant, the universe will expand exponentially with time in the far future, coming closer and closer to a de Sitter universe. This will eventually lead to all evidence for the Big Bang disappearing, as the cosmic microwave background is redshifted to lower intensities and longer wavelengths. Eventually, its frequency will be low enough that it will be absorbed by the interstellar medium, and so be screened from any observer within the galaxy. This will occur when the universe is less than 50 times its existing age, leading to the end of any life as the distant universe turns dark.

A constantly expanding universe with a non-zero cosmological constant has mass density decreasing over time. Under such a scenario, it is understood that all matter will ionize and disintegrate into isolated stable particles such as electrons and neutrinos, with all complex structures dissipating. This is called &quot;heat death of the universe&quot; (or the Big Freeze).

Alternatives for the ultimate fate of the universe include the Big Rip mentioned above, a Big Bounce, or a Big Crunch.

<doc id="39137" wikidata="Q1777391" url="?curid=39137" title="Quintessence (physics)">
<text>In physics, quintessence is a hypothetical form of dark energy, more precisely a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity, postulated as an explanation of the observation of an accelerating rate of expansion of the universe. The first example of this scenario was proposed by Ratra and Peebles (1988) and Wetterich (1988). The concept was expanded to more general types of time-varying dark energy, and the term &quot;quintessence&quot; was first introduced in a 1998 paper by Robert R. Caldwell, Rahul Dave and Paul Steinhardt. It has been proposed by some physicists to be a fifth fundamental force. Quintessence differs from the cosmological constant explanation of dark energy in that it is dynamic; that is, it changes over time, unlike the cosmological constant which, by definition, does not change. Quintessence can be either attractive or repulsive depending on the ratio of its kinetic and potential energy. Those working with this postulate believe that quintessence became repulsive about ten billion years ago, about 3.5 billion years after the Big Bang.

A group of researchers argued in 2021 that observations of the Hubble tension may imply that only quintessence models with a nonzero coupling constant are viable.

== Terminology ==
The name comes from &quot;quinta essentia&quot; (fifth element). So called in Latin starting from the Middle Ages, this was the (first) element added by Aristotle to the other four ancient classical elements because he thought it was the essence of the celestial world. Aristotle posited it to be a pure, fine, and primigenial element. Later scholars identified this element with &quot;aether&quot;. Similarly, modern quintessence would be the fifth known &quot;dynamical, time-dependent, and spatially inhomogeneous&quot; contribution to the overall mass–energy content of the universe.

Of course, the other four components are not the ancient Greek classical elements, but rather &quot;baryons, neutrinos, dark matter, [and] radiation.&quot; Although neutrinos are sometimes considered radiation, the term &quot;radiation&quot; in this context is only used to refer to massless photons. Spatial curvature of the cosmos (which has not been detected) is excluded because it is non-dynamical and homogeneous; the cosmological constant would not be considered a fifth component in this sense, because it is non-dynamical, homogeneous, and time-independent.

== Scalar field ==
Quintessence (&quot;Q&quot;) is a scalar field with an equation of state where &quot;w&quot;&quot;q&quot;, the ratio of pressure &quot;p&quot;&quot;q&quot; and density formula_1&quot;q&quot;, is given by the potential energy formula_2 and a kinetic term:
:formula_3
Hence, quintessence is dynamic, and generally has a density and &quot;w&quot;&quot;q&quot; parameter that varies with time. Specifically, &quot;w&quot;&quot;q&quot; parameter can vary within the range [-1,1]. By contrast, a cosmological constant is static, with a fixed energy density and &quot;w&quot;&quot;q&quot; = −1.

== Tracker behavior ==
Many models of quintessence have a &quot;tracker&quot; behavior, which according to Ratra and Peebles (1988) and Paul Steinhardt &quot;et al.&quot; (1999) partly solves the cosmological constant problem. In these models, the quintessence field has a density which closely tracks (but is less than) the radiation density until matter-radiation equality, which triggers quintessence to start having characteristics similar to dark energy, eventually dominating the universe. This naturally sets the low scale of the dark energy. When comparing the predicted expansion rate of the universe as given by the tracker solutions with cosmological data, a main feature of tracker solutions is that one needs four parameters to properly describe the behavior of their equation of state, whereas it has been shown that at most a two-parameter model can optimally be constrained by mid-term future data (horizon 2015–2020).

== Specific models ==
Some special cases of quintessence are phantom energy, in which &quot;w&quot;&quot;q&quot; &lt; −1, and k-essence (short for kinetic quintessence), which has a non-standard form of kinetic energy. If this type of energy were to exist, it would cause a big rip in the universe due to the growing energy density of dark energy, which would cause the expansion of the universe to increase at a faster-than-exponential rate.

===Holographic dark energy===
Holographic dark energy models, compared with cosmological constant models, imply a high degeneracy. It has been suggested that dark energy might originate from quantum fluctuations of spacetime, and is limited by the event horizon of the universe.

Studies with quintessence dark energy found that it dominates gravitational collapse in a spacetime simulation, based on the holographic thermalization. These results show that the smaller the state parameter of quintessence is, the harder it is for the plasma to thermalize.

== Quintom scenario ==
In 2004, when scientists fitted the evolution of dark energy with the cosmological data, they found that the equation of state had possibly crossed the cosmological constant boundary ( = –1) from above to below. A proven no-go theorem indicates this situation, called the Quintom scenario, requires at least two degrees of freedom for dark energy models involving ideal gases or scalar fields.

In 2024, more detailed data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument provided evidence suggesting a possible &quot;Quintom-B&quot; scenario, with the equation of state crossing the boundary from below to above.

<doc id="39139" wikidata="Q165196" url="?curid=39139" title="Proso millet">
<text>Panicum miliaceum is a grain crop with many common names, including proso millet, broomcorn millet, common millet, hog millet, Kashfi millet, red millet, and white millet. Archaeobotanical evidence suggests millet was first domesticated about 10,000 BP in Northern China. Major cultivated areas include Northern China, Himachal Pradesh of India, Nepal, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the Middle East, Turkey, Romania, and the Great Plains states of the United States. About are grown each year. The crop is notable both for its extremely short lifecycle, with some varieties producing grain only 60 days after planting, and its low water requirements, producing grain more efficiently per unit of moisture than any other grain species tested. The name &quot;proso millet&quot; comes from the pan-Slavic general and generic name for millet (, , , ). 

Proso millet is a relative of foxtail millet, pearl millet, maize, and sorghum within the grass subfamily Panicoideae. While all of these crops use C4 photosynthesis, the others all employ the NADP-ME as their primary carbon shuttle pathway, while the primary C4 carbon shuttle in proso millet is the NAD-ME pathway.

== Evolutionary history ==
&quot;Panicum miliaceum&quot; is a tetraploid species with a base chromosome number of 18, twice the base chromosome number of diploid species within its genus &quot;Panicum&quot;. The species appears to be an allotetraploid resulting from a wide hybrid between two different diploid ancestors. One of the two subgenomes within proso millet appears to have come from either &quot;P. capillare&quot; or a close relative of that species. The second subgenome does not show close homology to any known diploid &quot;Panicum&quot; species, but some unknown diploid ancestor apparently also contributed a copy of its genome to a separate allotetraploid species &quot;P. repens&quot; (torpedo grass). The two subgenomes within proso millet are estimated to have diverged 5.6 million years ago. However, the species has experienced only limited amounts of fractionation and copies of most genes are still retained on both subgenomes. A sequenced version of the proso millet genome, estimated to be around 920 megabase pairs in size, was published in 2019.

== Domestication and history of cultivation ==
Weedy forms of proso millet are found throughout central Asia, covering a widespread area from the Caspian Sea east to Xinjiang and Mongolia. These may represent the wild progenitor of proso millet or feral escapes from domesticated production. Indeed, in the United States, weedy proso millet, representing feral escapes from cultivation, are now common, suggesting current proso millet cultivars retain the potential to revert, similar to the pattern seen for weedy rice. Currently, the earliest archeological evidence for domesticated proso millet comes from the Cishan site in semiarid north east China around 8,000 BCE. Because early varieties of proso millet had such a short lifecycle, as little as 45 days from planting to harvest, they are thought to have made it possible for seminomadic tribes to first adopt agriculture, forming a bridge between hunter-gatherer-focused lifestyles and early agricultural civilizations. Archaeological charred grains of common millet were found in several Neolithic sites in Europe and Transcaucasia but radiocarbon dates obtained thanks to AMS method directly from the grains, indicated that it appeared in that area in the 2nd millennium BC. At around 1700 BCE, broomcorn millet was present north of the Black Sea, 1450 BCE in central Europe, and 1200 BCE in northern Europe.

=== Cultivation ===

Proso millet is a relatively low-demanding crop, and diseases are not known; consequently, it is often used in organic farming systems in Europe. In the United States, it is often used as an intercrop. Thus, proso millet can help to avoid a summer fallow, and continuous crop rotation can be achieved. Its superficial root system and its resistance to atrazine residue make proso millet a good intercrop between two water- and pesticide-demanding crops. The stubbles of the last crop, by allowing more heat into the soil, result in a faster and earlier millet growth. While millet occupies the ground, because of its superficial root system, the soil can replenish its water content for the next crop. Later crops, for example, a winter wheat, can in turn benefit from the millet stubble, which act as snow accumulators. &quot;P. miliaceum&quot; is commonly classified into five races, &quot;miliaceum&quot;, &quot;patentissimum&quot;, &quot;contractum&quot;, &quot;compactum&quot;, and &quot;ovatum&quot;.

=== Climate and soil requirements ===
Due to its C4 photosynthetic system, proso millet is thermophilic like maize, so shady locations of the field should be avoided. It is sensitive to temperatures lower than . Proso millet is highly drought-resistant, which makes it of interest to regions with low water availability and longer periods without rain. The soil should be light or medium-heavy. Due to its flat root systems, soil compaction must be avoided. Furthermore, proso millet does not tolerate soil wetness caused by dammed-up water.

A 2019 study found different cultivars have significantly different effects on rhizosphere assemblage, and also that &quot;Proteobacteria&quot;, &quot;Bacteroidetes&quot;, &quot;Chloroflexi&quot;, &quot;Gemmatimonadetes&quot;, &quot;Firmicutes&quot;, &quot;Verrucomicrobia&quot;, and &quot;Planctomycetes&quot; are the most common members, in declining order.

=== Seedbed and sowing ===
The seedbed should be finely crumbled as for sugar beet and rapeseed. In Europe, proso millet is sowed between mid-April and the end of May. About of seeds are required, which is roughly . In organic farming, this amount should be increased if a harrow weeder is used. For sowing, the usual sowing machines can be used similarly to how they are used for other crops such as wheat. A distance between the rows of is recommended if the farmer uses an interrow cultivator. The sowing depth should be in optimal soil or in dry soil. Rolling of the ground after sowing is helpful for further cultivation. Cultivation in no-till farming systems is also possible and often practiced in the United States. Sowing then can be done two weeks later.
=== Field management ===
Only a few diseases and pests are known to attack proso millet, but they are not economically important. Weeds are a bigger problem. The critical phase is in juvenile development. The formation of the grains happens in the 3- to 5-leaf stage. After that, all nutrients should be available for the millet, so preventing the growth of weeds is necessary. In conventional farming, herbicides may be used. In organic farming, harrow weeder or interrow cultivator use is possible, but special sowing parameters are needed.
For good crop development, fertilization with nitrogen per hectare is recommended. Planting proso millet in a crop rotation after maize should be avoided due to its same weed spectrum. Because proso millet is an undemanding crop, it may be used at the end of the rotation.

=== Harvesting and postharvest treatments ===
Harvest time is at the end of August until mid-September. Determining the best harvest date is not easy because all the grains do not ripen simultaneously. The grains on the top of the panicle ripen first, while the grains in the lower parts need more time, making compromise and harvest necessary to optimize yield. Harvesting can be done with a conventional combine harvester with the moisture content of the grains around 15-20%. Usually, proso millet is mowed into windrows first, since the plants are not dry like wheat. There, they can wither, which makes the threshing easier. Then the harvest is done with a pickup attached to a combine.
Possible yields are between under optimal conditions. Studies in Germany showed that even higher yields can be attained.

===Geographical distribution===
In the United States, as of 2015, the total cultivated area of proso millet was , mostly in the Great Plains states. The top three producers in 2015 were Colorado, Nebraska, and South Dakota, with , , and . Historically grown as animal and bird seed, as of 2020, it has found a market as an organic gluten-free grain.

Proso millet is one of the few types of millet not cultivated in Africa.

==As food and drink==

===Humans===
In Inner Mongolia and northwestern Shanxi, China, fermented proso millet porridge known as &quot;suan zhou&quot; (酸粥) is popular. Millet is soaked to allow fermentation, then water is emptied to obtain porridge. The emptied water is served as a millet drink called &quot;suan mi tang&quot; (酸米湯). The porridge is eaten alongside pickles, e.g. turnips, carrots, radish and celery. The porridge may be stirred-fried and is called &quot;chao suan zhou&quot; (炒酸粥). The porridge may also be steamed into solids known as &quot;suan lao fan&quot; (酸撈飯). While the traditional grain is proso millet, it is mixed with rice when available. Many folk idioms of sourness derive from this dish.

In the United States, proso millet is used to brew gluten-free beer, being mixed with other grains to produce a texture.

===Livestock and poultry===
Proso millet is primarily grown as livestock and poultry fodder. As food it is very deficient in lysine and needs complementation. Proso millet is also a poor fodder due to its low leaf-to-stem ratio and a possible irritant effect due to its hairy stem. Foxtail millet, having a higher leaf-to-stem ratio and less hairy stems, is preferred as fodder, particularly the variety called moha, which is a high-quality fodder.

=== Nutrition ===
Millet flour is 9% water, 75% carbohydrates, 11% protein, and 4% fat (table). In a reference amount of , millet flour supplies 382 calories, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of several B vitamins and dietary minerals (table). 

The demand for more diverse and healthier cereal-based foods is increasing, particularly in affluent countries. Protein content in proso millet grains is comparable with that of wheat, but the share of some essential amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and methionine) is substantially higher in proso millet. Among the most commonly consumed products are ready-to-eat breakfast cereals made purely from millet flour, and a variety of noodles and bakery products that are, however, often produced from mixtures with wheat flour to improve their sensory quality.

==Fermentation products==
Starch derived from millets has been shown to be a good substrate for fermentation and malting with grains having similar starch contents as wheat grains. One study suggested that starch derived from proso millet can be converted to ethanol with an only moderately lower efficiency than starch derived from corn. As proso millet is compatible with low-input agriculture, cultivation on marginal soils for biofuel production may present a new market for farmers.

==Pests==
Insect pests include:

;Seedling pests
*shoot fly &quot;Atherigona pulla&quot; (proso millet shoot fly, a major pest in India and Africa)
*&quot;Atherigona miliaceae&quot;, &quot;Atherigona soccata&quot;, and &quot;A. punctata&quot;
*wheat stem maggot &quot;Meromyza americana&quot; occurs in the United States
*thrip, &quot;Haplothrips aculeatus&quot;
*armyworms &quot;Mythimna separata&quot;, &quot;M. unipuncta&quot;, &quot;Spodoptera exempta&quot;, and &quot;S. frugiperda&quot;
*field cricket &quot;Brachytrupes&quot; sp.

;Stem borers
*&quot;Chilo partellus&quot;, &quot;Ch. suppressalis&quot;, &quot;Chilo orichalcociliellus&quot;, &quot;Sesamia inferens&quot;, &quot;S. cretica&quot;, and &quot;Ostrinia furnacalis&quot;

;Leaf feeders
*leaf folders &quot;Cnaphalocrocis medinalis&quot; and &quot;Cn. patnalis&quot;
*hairy caterpillar &quot;Spilosoma obliqua&quot;
*rice butterfly &quot;Melanitis leda ismene&quot;
*Moroccan locust &quot;Dociostaurus maroccanus&quot;
*migratory locust &quot;Locusta migratoria&quot;
*grasshoppers &quot;Hieroglyphus banian&quot; and &quot;Oxya chinensis&quot;

;Earhead feeders
*cotton boll worm &quot;Helicoverpa zea&quot; (in the United States)

;Other pests
*aphid &quot;Sipha flava&quot; (in North America)
*earhead bug &quot;Leptocorisa acuta&quot; and green bug &quot;Nezara viridula&quot; suck the milky developing grains in India
*termites, &quot;Odontotermes&quot; spp. and &quot;Microtermes&quot; spp., are the common species recorded on proso millet during dry seasons in India.

==As a weed==
Weedy and feral types are classified as &quot;Panicum ruderale&quot;(Kitag.) Chang comb. Nov. or &quot;Panicum miliaceum&quot; subsp. &quot;ruderale&quot;. A 2018 report developed a morphometric analysis method which distinguishes seeds of &quot;P. miliaceum&quot; and &quot;P. ruderale&quot; on the basis of micromorphology.

<doc id="39140" wikidata="Q3678789" url="?curid=39140" title="Dyson's eternal intelligence">
<text>Dyson&#x27;s eternal intelligence (the Dyson Scenario) is a hypothetical concept, proposed by Freeman Dyson in 1979, by which an immortal society of intelligent beings in an open universe may escape the prospect of the heat death of the universe by performing an infinite number of computations (as defined below) though expending only a finite amount of energy.

Bremermann&#x27;s limit can be invoked to deduce a lower bound on the amount of time required to distinguish two discrete energy levels of a quantum system using a quantum measurement. One can interpret this measurement as a computation on 1 bit for this system; however, Bremermann&#x27;s limit is difficult to interpret physically, since there exist quantum Hamiltonians for which this interpretation would give arbitrarily fast computation speeds at arbitrarily low energy. Following this interpretation, the upper bound on the number of such measurements that can be performed grows over time. Assuming that the energy in the quantum system on which the measurement is performed is lost (while ignoring energy that is lost due to the measurement apparatus itself), the energy available from the mechanism suggested below slows logarithmically, but never stops.

The intelligent beings would begin by storing a finite amount of energy. They then use half (or any fraction) of this energy to power their computation. When the energy is used up, they would enter a state of zero-energy-consumption until the universe cooled. Once the universe had cooled sufficiently, half of the remaining half (one quarter of the original energy) of the intelligent beings&#x27; fuel reserves would once again be released, powering a brief period of computation once more. This would continue, with smaller and smaller amounts of energy being released. As the universe cooled, the computations would be slower and slower, but there would still be an infinite number of them.

In 1998, it was discovered that the expansion of the universe appears to be accelerating rather than decelerating due to a positive cosmological constant, implying that any two regions of the universe will eventually become permanently separated from one another. Dyson noted that &quot;in an accelerated universe everything is different&quot;. However, even if the cosmological constant is formula_1, the matter density in an FLRW universe would converge to formula_1 at rate formula_3, suggesting that the stored energy would become unavailable even if it is not used.

==Legacy==
Frank J. Tipler has cited Dyson&#x27;s writings, and specifically his writings on the eternal intelligence, as a major influence on his own highly controversial Omega Point theory.
Tipler&#x27;s theory differs from Dyson&#x27;s theory on several key points, most notable of which is that Dyson&#x27;s eternal intelligence presupposes an open universe while Tipler&#x27;s Omega Point presupposes a closed/contracting universe. Both theories will be invalidated if the observed universal expansion continues to accelerate.

<text>Prince Igor (, ) is an opera in four acts with a prologue, written and composed by Alexander Borodin. The composer adapted the libretto from the early Russian epic &quot;The Lay of Igor&#x27;s Host&quot;, which recounts the campaign of the 12th-century prince Igor Svyatoslavich against the invading Cuman (&quot;Polovtsian&quot;) tribes in 1185. He also incorporated material drawn from two medieval Kievan chronicles. The opera was left unfinished upon the composer&#x27;s death in 1887 and was edited and completed by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Glazunov. It was first performed in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1890.

==Composition history==
===Original composition: 1869–1887===

After briefly considering Lev Mei&#x27;s &quot;The Tsar&#x27;s Bride&quot; as a subject (later taken up in 1898 by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, his 9th opera), Borodin began looking for a new project for his first opera. Vladimir Stasov, critic and advisor to The Mighty Handful, suggested &quot;The Lay of Igor&#x27;s Host&quot;, a 12th century epic prose poem, and sent Borodin a scenario for a three-act opera on 30 April 1869. Initially, Borodin found the proposition intriguing, but daunting:

After collecting material from literary sources, Borodin began composition in September 1869 with initial versions of Yaroslavna&#x27;s arioso and Konchakovna&#x27;s cavatina, and sketched the Polovtsian Dances and March of the Polovtsy. He soon began to have doubts and ceased composing. He expressed his misgivings in a letter to his wife: &quot;There is too little drama here, and no movement ... To me, opera without drama, in the strict sense, is unnatural.&quot; This began a period of about four years in which he proceeded no further on &quot;Prince Igor&quot;, but began diverting materials for the opera into his other works, the Symphony No. 2 in B minor (1869–1876) and the collaborative opera-ballet &quot;Mlada&quot; (1872).

The &quot;Mlada&quot; project was soon aborted, and Borodin, like the other members of The Mighty Handful who were involved – César Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, and Rimsky-Korsakov – thought about ways to recycle the music he contributed. Of the eight numbers he had composed for Act 4 of &quot;Mlada&quot;, those that eventually found their way into (or back into) &quot;Prince Igor&quot; included No. 1 (Prologue: The opening C major chorus), No. 2 (material for Yaroslavna&#x27;s arioso and Igor&#x27;s aria), No. 3 (Prologue: The eclipse), No. 4 (Act 3: The trio), and No. 8 (Act 4: The closing chorus).

Borodin returned to &quot;Prince Igor&quot; in 1874, inspired by the success of his colleagues Rimsky-Korsakov and Mussorgsky in the staging of their historical operas, &quot;The Maid of Pskov&quot; (1873) and &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; (1874). This period also marks the creation of two new characters, the deserters Skula and Yeroshka, who have much in common with the rogue monks Varlaam and Misail in &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;.

In his memoirs, Rimsky-Korsakov mentions an 1876 concert at which Borodin&#x27;s &quot;closing chorus&quot; was performed, the first public performance of any music from &quot;Prince Igor&quot; identified by him:

The idea of a choral epilogue in the original scenario was no doubt inspired by the example of &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; by Mikhail Glinka, to whose memory &quot;Prince Igor&quot; is dedicated.

Borodin&#x27;s primary occupation was chemistry, including research and teaching. However, he also spent much time in support of women&#x27;s causes, much to the consternation of his fellow composers, who felt he should devote his time and talent to music. In 1876, a frustrated Stasov gave up hope that Borodin would ever finish &quot;Prince Igor&quot;, and offered his scenario to Rimsky-Korsakov. Rimsky-Korsakov instead assisted Borodin in orchestrating important numbers in preparation for concert performance; for example, the &quot;Polovtsian Dances&quot; in 1879:

Borodin worked on &quot;Prince Igor&quot;, off and on, for almost 18 years.

===Posthumous completion and orchestration: 1887–1888===
Borodin died suddenly in 1887, leaving &quot;Prince Igor&quot; incomplete. Rimsky-Korsakov and Stasov went to Borodin&#x27;s home, collected his scores, and brought them to Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s house.

The often-repeated account that Glazunov reconstructed and orchestrated the overture from memory after hearing the composer play it at the piano is true only in part. The following statement by Glazunov himself clarifies the matter:

==Musical analysis==
Central to the opera is the way the Russians are distinguished from the Polovtsians through melodic characterization. While Borodin uses features of Russian folk music to represent his compatriots, he uses chromaticism, melismas and appoggiaturas—among other techniques—represent their &#x27;heathen&#x27; opponents. These methods had already been used by Glinka and others to portray Orientalism in Russian music.

==Performance history==
The world premiere was given in St. Petersburg on 4 November (23 October O.S.), 1890 at the Mariinsky Theatre. Set designers were Yanov, Andreyev, and Bocharov, while Lev Ivanov was balletmaster. Moscow premieres followed in 1892 by the Russian Opera Society, conducted by Iosif Pribik. The Bolshoi Theatre premiere was given in 1898 and was conducted by Ulrikh Avranek

Other notable premieres were given in Prague in 1899 and in Paris in 1909, with a Sergei Diaghilev production featuring Feodor Chaliapin as Galitsky and Maria Nikolaevna Kuznetsova as Yaroslavna. Ivanov&#x27;s choreography was revived by Mikhail Fokin (and in that form can be seen in the 1969 film. London saw the same production in 1914 conducted by Thomas Beecham, again with Chaliapin as Galitsky. In 1915 the United States premiere took place at the Metropolitan Opera, staged in Italian and conducted by Giorgio Polacco. The first performance in English was at Covent Garden on 26 July 1919, with Miriam Licette as Yaroslavna.

In January and February 2009 there was a production at the Aalto Theatre by the Essen Opera. While some aspects of the production may have been unusual, one critic noted that &quot;placing the (Polovtsian) Dances as a Finale is an elegant idea, ... the director Andrejs Zagars and the conductor Noam Zur have thus presented a musically and dramaturgically coherent &quot;Prince Igor&quot;. Heartfelt applause for a worthwhile evening at the opera.&quot;

In 2011 there was a concert performance in Moscow by Helikon Opera, based on Pavel Lamm&#x27;s reconstruction. A new edition based on 92 surviving manuscripts by Borodin was completed by musicologist Anna Bulycheva and published in 2012.

In 2014, the Metropolitan Opera in New York City staged a reconceived version, sung in Russian for the first time there. Director Dmitri Tcherniakov and conductor Gianandrea Noseda removed most of the melodies contributed by Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov, although they retained those composers&#x27; orchestrations. They added many fragments by Borodin that Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov had omitted, basing their work on many decades of musicological research. They rearranged the order in which some of the material appeared, in some cases taking account of notes left by Borodin. The overall conception made the opera more of a psychological drama about Prince Igor and his state of mind, given the deep depression he went into following his soldiers&#x27; loss to the Polovtsians. The entire opera was reordered: after the prologue, in which the solar eclipse was taken as a bad omen, Act 1 presented a dream sequence dealing with the relation of Igor and his son with the Polovtsian general and his daughter in the Polovtsian camp. The second act largely dealt with the antics of Prince Galitsky in Putivyl and ended with the destruction of the city. The third act ended with Prince Igor coming out of his depression to begin the rebuilding of the destroyed city. This production starred Russian bass Ildar Abdrazakov in the title role with Ukrainian soprano Oksana Dyka as Yaroslavna. The performances in New York included a worldwide HD broadcast. The production was jointly produced with De Nederlandse Opera of Amsterdam.

At the beginning of the Opening Ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in February 2014, some of Borodin&#x27;s music from this opera was played while an eclipsed sun, crescent-shaped, drifted across the upper levels of the center of the stadium, showing the basis of Russian history in the Prince Igor story.

==Roles==
&quot;Note:&quot;
* &quot;The actual given name of the historical Yaroslavna is Yefrosinya (, ). &quot;Yaroslavna&quot; is a patronymic, meaning &quot;daughter of Yaroslav&quot;. Konchakovna&#x27;s name is similarly derived.&quot;
* &quot;Yaroslavna&#x27;s brother, Vladimir Yaroslavich, is often called &quot;Prince Galitsky&quot; (), leading to the misconception that he was a prince by the name of Galitsky. In fact, he was a son of Prince of Galich Yaroslav Osmomysl. &quot;Prince Galitsky&quot; is a title meaning &quot;Prince of Galich&quot;.&quot;

==Synopsis==
&quot;Time&quot;: The year 1185

&quot;Place&quot;: The city of Putivl (prologue, Acts 1 and 4); a Polovtsian camp (Acts 2 and 3)
Note: &quot;As discussed in this article, Borodin&#x27;s final decision on the order of the first two acts is unclear. The traditional grouping presented here is that of the Rimsky-Korsakov-Glazunov edition. In many productions, Act 3 is omitted.&quot;

===Prologue===
&quot;The cathedral square in Putivl&quot;

Prince Igor is about to set out on a campaign against the Cumans/Polovtsy and their Khans who have previously attacked the Russian lands. The people sing his praise and that of his son, the other leaders and the army (&quot;Chorus: &quot;Glory to the beautiful Sun&quot;&quot;). A solar eclipse takes place to general consternation. Two soldiers Skula and Yeroshka desert feeling sure that Vladimir Yaroslavich, Prince Galitsky, will offer them work more to their liking. Although Yaroslavna, Igor&#x27;s wife, takes the eclipse for a bad omen, Igor insists that honour demands that he go to war. He leaves her to the care of her brother, Prince Galitsky, who tells of his gratitude to Igor for sheltering him after he was banished from his own home by his father and brothers. The people sing a great chorus of praise (&quot;Chorus: &quot;Glory to the multitude of stars&quot;&quot;) as the host sets out on their campaign against the Polovtsy.

===Act 1===
&quot;Scene 1: Vladimir Galitsky&#x27;s court in Putivl&quot;

Galitsky&#x27;s followers sing his praise. Skula and Yeroshka are now working as gudok-players. They entertain the followers and all sing of how Galitsky and his men abducted a young woman and how she pleaded to be allowed to return to her father without being dishonoured. The prince arrives and sings of how, if he were Prince of Putivl, he would drink and feast all day while dispensing judgment and have the prettiest maidens with him all night (&quot;Galitsky&#x27;s Song&quot;). The treasury would be spent on himself and his men while his sister would be praying in a monastery. A group of young women beg the prince to restore their abducted friend. He threatens them and drives them away, saying how she now lives in luxury in his quarters and does not have to work. The prince returns to his rooms having sent for wine for his followers. The gudok players and the prince&#x27;s followers mock the women. They wonder what might happen if Yaroslavna hears of what happens, but then realise she would be helpless with all her men gone to war. They sing of how they are all drunkards and are supported by Galitsky. The men decide to go to the town square to declare Galitsky the Prince of Putivl, leaving just the two drunk musicians behind.

&quot;Scene 2: A room in Yaroslavna&#x27;s palace&quot;

Yaroslavna is alone worrying about why she has not heard from Igor and his companions (&quot;Yaroslavna&#x27;s Arioso&quot;). She sings of her tearful nights and nightmares and reminisces about when she was happy with Igor by her side. The nurse brings in the young women who tell Yaroslavna of their abducted friend. They are reluctant at first to reveal the culprit but eventually name Galitsky and talk of how he and his drunken followers cause trouble around Putivl. Galitsky enters and the women run away. Yaroslavna questions him as to the truth of their story and he mocks her saying she should treat him as a guest in her house. She threatens him with what Igor will do on his return, but Galitsky replies that he can seize the throne whenever he wants. Yaroslavna accuses him of repeating the betrayal that he carried out against their father, but he replies that he was only joking and asks if she has a lover now her husband is away. She threatens him with sending him back to their father. He replies that he will return the girl but will take another later and leaves. The council of boyars arrive to inform Yaroslavna that the Polovtsy under Khan Gzak are about to attack Putivl. Igor&#x27;s army has been utterly destroyed and he has been wounded and captured with his son and brother. After a moment of faintness, Yaroslavna orders messengers sent to the city&#x27;s allies, but the Boyars report that the roads are cut, some towns are in revolt and their princes will be captured. The Boyars say that they will organise the defence but Galitsky returns with his followers to demand that a new Prince be chosen. His retinue say it should be him as he is Yaroslavna&#x27;s brother and Igor&#x27;s brother-in-law. The boyars refuse. The argument is interrupted by the sight of flames and the sound of crying women. Some of the boyars flee; some join the battle, others guard the Princess. They call the attack God&#x27;s judgment.

===Act 2===
&quot;Evening in the Polovtsian Camp&quot;

Polovtsian maidens sing comparing love to a flower that droops in the heat of the day and is revived by night. They dance together (&quot;Dance of the Polovtsian Maidens&quot;). Konchakovna joins in the singing hoping that her own lover will join her soon (&quot;Konchakovna&#x27;s Cavatina&quot;). The Russian prisoners arrive from their day&#x27;s work and express their gratitude when fed by Konchakovna and the maidens. Their guards retire for the night leaving just Ovlur, a Christian, in charge. Vladimir, son of Igor, sings of his hope that his love will soon join him now that the day is fading (&quot;Vladimir&#x27;s Cavatina&quot;). His love is Konchakovna. She comes and the two sing of their love and their desire to marry (&quot;Love Duet&quot;). While her father will consent to the marriage, they know that his will not. They part when they hear Igor coming. He sings of his disgrace and torment at being captured with his followers dead (&quot;Prince Igor&#x27;s Aria&quot;). Only his wife, he feels, will be loyal. He hopes for the chance to regain his honour. Ovlur urges Igor to escape and the prince agrees to think about it. Khan Konchak asks him if all is well (&quot;Konchak&#x27;s Aria&quot;) and he replies that the falcon cannot live in captivity. Konchak says that as Igor did not ask for mercy he is not a prisoner but an honoured guest equal to a Khan. Igor reminds him that he too knows what it is to be a captive. Konchak offers Igor freedom if he will promise not to wage war on him again, but he refuses saying he cannot lie. Konchak regrets that they were not born to be allies. They would then have captured all of Russia. He summons the Polovtsian slaves to entertain Igor and himself and offers Igor his choice of them. As the slaves dance the Polovtsy sing of Konchak&#x27;s glory (&quot;Polovtsian Dances&quot;).

===Act 3===
&quot;The Polovtsian camp&quot;
The Polovtsian army returns in triumph singing the praise of Khan Gzak (&quot;Polovtsian March&quot;). Konchak sings of the sack of Putivl and other victories and confidently predicts that they will soon capture all of Russia. Igor and his son Vladimir have their worst fears confirmed by the new captives. Vladimir and the other prisoners urge Igor to escape, but he is at first reluctant, singing of his shame and saying that it is the duty of the other Russian princes to save the homeland (&quot;Igor&#x27;s Monologue&quot;, Mariinsky edition only). Ovlur now arrives to say that he has prepared horses for Igor and Vladimir and Igor now agrees to escape. The distressed Konchakovna comes, challenging Vladimir to show his love by either taking her with him or by staying. Igor urges his son to come, but Vladimir feels unable to leave Konchakovna who threatens to wake the camp. Eventually Igor flees alone and Konchakovna sounds the alarm. She and her father refuse to let the Polovtsy kill Vladimir. Instead Konchak orders the death of the guards and marries Vladimir to his daughter. As for Igor, Konchak thinks more of him for his escape.

===Act 4===
&quot;Dawn in Putivl&quot;

Yaroslavna weeps at her separation from Igor and the defeat of his army, blaming the very elements themselves for helping the enemy (&quot;Yaroslavna&#x27;s Lament&quot;). Peasant women blame not the wind but Khan Gzak for the devastation. As Yaroslavna looks around to acknowledge the destruction, she sees two riders in the distance who turn out to be Igor and Ovlur. The two lovers sing of their joy of being reunited and of the expectation that Igor will lead the Russians to victory against the Khan. Unaware of Igor&#x27;s return, Skula and Yeroshka, the drunken gudok players, sing a song that mocks him. Then they notice him in the distance. After a moment of panic about what will happen to them, Skula says that they should rely on their cunning and decides on a plan that will save them. They ring the church bells to summon a crowd. Although people at first treat them with suspicion, the gudok players manage to convince the crowd that Igor has returned and the boyars that they are loyal followers of the true prince and not Galitsky. All joyously celebrate Igor&#x27;s return.

Both the Overture to &quot;Prince Igor&quot; and the &quot;Polovtsian Dances&quot; (from Act II) are well-known concert standards. Together with the &quot;Polovtsian March&quot;, they form the so-called &quot;suite&quot; from the opera.

==Critical analysis==
&quot;Prince Igor&quot; is a staple of Russian opera, but has not travelled well abroad. One obvious reason is the Russian language, although translation into Italian was once a solution.

Another explanation for the failure to gain acceptance is its lack of unity resulting from its unfinished state. Despite the skill and efforts of editors Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov, the opera is still episodic and dramatically static, a problem of which the composer himself was aware when he embarked on composition (see quote above in &quot;Composition History&quot;). This is partly a consequence of Borodin&#x27;s failure to complete a libretto before beginning composition of the music—the same problem that plagued his colleague Mussorgsky in the composition of &quot;Khovanshchina&quot;. Both composers wrote their librettos piece by piece while composing the music, both lost sight of the overall narrative thread of their operas, and both wound up with pages and pages of music that needed to be sacrificed to assemble a cohesive whole. Also, both died before finishing their operas, leaving the task of completion, editing, and orchestration in both cases to Rimsky-Korsakov.

==Performance practice==
One of the main considerations when performing &quot;Prince Igor&quot; is the question of whether to include Act 3, much of which was composed by Glazunov. The practice of omitting it was mentioned as early as 1909 in Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s memoirs. Many productions leave Act 3 out because it &quot;fails to carry conviction both musically and dramatically.&quot;
On the other hand, maintaining the act has certain benefits. It contains some fine pages (e.g., the &quot;Polovtsian March&quot;), provides an important link in the narrative (Igor&#x27;s escape, Vladimir&#x27;s fate), and is the origin of some of the memorable themes first heard in the overture (the trio, brass fanfares). Fortunately, the option of omitting the fine overture, also known to have been composed by Glazunov, is seldom considered.

Recently, the question of the best sequence of scenes in which to perform the opera has gained some prominence. Borodin did not complete a libretto before composing the music to &quot;Prince Igor&quot;. The opera has traditionally been performed in the edition made by Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov. It will be obvious that the positions to which they assigned the Prologue, Act 3, and Act 4 cannot be changed if the story is to make sense. However, because the events of Act 1 and Act 2 overlap and are independent of one another, Act 2 may just as well precede Act 1 without any loss of coherence. Soviet musicologists Pavel Lamm and Arnold Sokhor reported the existence of a written plan (now in Glinka&#x27;s Musical Culture Museum, Moscow), in Borodin&#x27;s hand, that specified this sequence of scenes:

# The omen from heaven (Prologue)
# Imprisonment (Act 2)
# Galitsky&#x27;s court (Act 1, Scene 1)
# Yaroslavna&#x27;s palace (Act 1, Scene 2)
# Escape (Act 3)
# Return (Act 4)

Sokhor assessed the plan as not written later than 1883.
The 1993 recording of &quot;Prince Igor&quot; by Valery Gergiev with the Kirov Opera features a new edition of the score with additions commissioned from composer Yuri Faliek for a production at the Mariinsky Theatre, adopting this hypothetical original sequence. The authors of the notes to the recording assert that this order better balances the musical structure of the score by alternating the acts in the Russian and Polovtsian settings with their distinctive musical atmospheres.

Despite this justification, there is reason to maintain the traditional sequence. Act II contains most of the numbers for which the work is known today, with Igor&#x27;s brooding and impassioned aria (&quot;Oh give me freedom&quot;) at the center, flanked by Vladimir&#x27;s cavatina and Konchak&#x27;s aria, not to mention the rousing conclusion provided by the &quot;Polovtsian Dances.&quot; Moving its wealth of arias and dances from the center of the work to near the beginning may weaken the opera&#x27;s structure.

The &quot;Mariinsky edition&quot; makes other important changes and additions to the score. Although much of the material composed or orchestrated by Glazunov and Rimsky-Korsakov is retained, there are additions culled from the unpublished vocal score by Pavel Lamm, orchestrated and linked by Faliek. The changes include:
* About 200 bars added to the scene in Yaroslavna&#x27;s palace which make explicit Galitsky&#x27;s rebellion
* Various additions and removals from Act 3, including the restoration of a monologue for Igor composed by Borodin in 1875. A review in &quot;Gramophone&quot; highlights how the newly added monologue &quot;helps to give a weighty focus to Act 3, otherwise a phenomenal feat of reconstruction on Glazunov&#x27;s part, but somehow insubstantial&quot;.
* A different final chorus for Act 4, &quot;Glory to the multitude of stars&quot;, a repeat of material from the Prologue. This idea is historically justified, as Borodin had originally placed this chorus at the end of the opera in the form of an epilogue [see the quote by Rimsky-Korsakov above under Composition history]. This regrettably necessitates the elimination of Borodin&#x27;s subsequent chorus, &quot;God heard our prayers&quot;.

Outside Russia, the opera has often been given in languages other than Russian. For example, the 1960 recording under Lovro von Matačić is sung in German, the 1964 recording under Armando La Rosa Parodi is in Italian and the 1982 radio broadcast of Opera North conducted by David Lloyd-Jones is in English. On the other hand, the 1962 Oscar Danon and the 1990 Bernard Haitink recordings are Western performances sung in Russian.

== Popular culture ==
In the American musical &quot;Kismet&quot; (1953), most of the score was adapted from works by Borodin. Themes from the Polovtsian Dances from &quot;Prince Igor&quot; were used extensively and the &quot;Gliding Dance of the Maidens&quot; provided the melody for the popular hit song &quot;Stranger in Paradise&quot;.

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Simpson Tide&quot;, the Boyars&#x27; Chorus (Act 1, Scene 2) plays while tanks emerge from parade floats during a peace parade on Red Square in front of Saint Basil&#x27;s, soldiers walk out of a building, the Berlin Wall re-erects itself out of the ground, and Lenin rises from his grave, saying &quot;Rrr! Must Crush Capitalism, Rrr!&quot;. The &quot;Gliding dance of the Maidens&quot; is also played during the Valentine&#x27;s Day Itchy and Scratchy cartoon featured in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;I Love Lisa&quot;.

Musical quotations from the Polovtsian Dances can be heard: 
* in Warren G&#x27;s 1997 hit &quot;Prince Igor&quot;, and in the track &quot;Echoes&quot; on Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1971 album, &quot;Meddle&quot;

<doc id="39145" wikidata="Q7712114" url="?curid=39145" title="The Abduction of Figaro">
<text>The Abduction of Figaro is a comic opera in three acts, described as &quot;A Simply Grand Opera by P. D. Q. Bach&quot;, by Peter Schickele. It is a parody of opera in general, and the title is a play on two operas by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: &quot;The Abduction from the Seraglio&quot;, K. 384, and &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, K. 492. Those two operas, as well as &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, and Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; are among the core inspirations for the piece. &quot;The Abduction of Figaro&quot; is numbered S. 384, 492 in Schickele&#x27;s catalogue of works.

Schickele was commissioned to &quot;discover&quot; this opera by the Minnesota Opera, where the piece premiered on April 27 and 28, 1984. In addition to parodying Mozart, the music incorporates diverse influences and musical quotes, from traditional camp songs like &quot;Found a Peanut&quot; to popular songs like &quot;Macho Man&quot; by the Village People. The opera has been released on VHS and DVD.

<text>A finite difference is a mathematical expression of the form . Finite differences (or the associated difference quotients) are often used as approximations of derivatives, such as in numerical differentiation.

The difference operator, commonly denoted formula_1, is the operator that maps a function to the function formula_2 defined by
formula_3
A difference equation is a functional equation that involves the finite difference operator in the same way as a differential equation involves derivatives. There are many similarities between difference equations and differential equations. Certain recurrence relations can be written as difference equations by replacing iteration notation with finite differences.

In numerical analysis, finite differences are widely used for approximating derivatives, and the term &quot;finite difference&quot; is often used as an abbreviation of &quot;finite difference approximation of derivatives&quot;.

Finite differences were introduced by Brook Taylor in 1715 and have also been studied as abstract self-standing mathematical objects in works by George Boole (1860), L. M. Milne-Thomson (1933), and (1939). Finite differences trace their origins back to one of Jost Bürgi&#x27;s algorithms () and work by others including Isaac Newton. The formal calculus of finite differences can be viewed as an alternative to the calculus of infinitesimals.

==Basic types==

Three basic types are commonly considered: &quot;forward&quot;, &quot;backward&quot;, and &quot;central&quot; finite differences.

A , denoted formula_4 of a function is a function defined as
formula_5

Depending on the application, the spacing may be variable or constant. When omitted, is taken to be 1; that is, 
formula_6

A uses the function values at and , instead of the values at and :
formula_7

Finally, the is given by
formula_8

== Relation with derivatives ==
The approximation of derivatives by finite differences plays a central role in finite difference methods for the numerical solution of differential equations, especially boundary value problems.

The derivative of a function at a point is defined by the limit
formula_9

If has a fixed (non-zero) value instead of approaching zero, then the right-hand side of the above equation would be written
formula_10

Hence, the forward difference divided by approximates the derivative when is small. The error in this approximation can be derived from Taylor&#x27;s theorem. Assuming that is twice differentiable, we have
formula_11

The same formula holds for the backward difference:
formula_12

However, the central (also called centered) difference yields a more accurate approximation. If is three times differentiable,
formula_13

The main problem with the central difference method, however, is that oscillating functions can yield zero derivative. If for odd, and for even, then if it is calculated with the central difference scheme. This is particularly troublesome if the domain of is discrete. See also Symmetric derivative.

Authors for whom finite differences mean finite difference approximations define the forward/backward/central differences as the quotients given in this section (instead of employing the definitions given in the previous section).

==Higher-order differences==

In an analogous way, one can obtain finite difference approximations to higher order derivatives and differential operators. For example, by using the above central difference formula for and and applying a central difference formula for the derivative of at , we obtain the central difference approximation of the second derivative of :

;Second-order central :formula_14

Similarly we can apply other differencing formulas in a recursive manner.

;Second order forward :formula_15
;Second order backward :formula_16

More generally, the -th order forward, backward, and central differences are given by, respectively,

;Forward :formula_17
;Backward :formula_18
;Central :formula_19

These equations use binomial coefficients after the summation sign shown as . Each row of Pascal&#x27;s triangle provides the coefficient for each value of .

Note that the central difference will, for odd , have multiplied by non-integers. This is often a problem because it amounts to changing the interval of discretization. The problem may be remedied substituting the average of formula_20 and formula_21

Forward differences applied to a sequence are sometimes called the binomial transform of the sequence, and have a number of interesting combinatorial properties. Forward differences may be evaluated using the Nörlund–Rice integral. The integral representation for these types of series is interesting, because the integral can often be evaluated using asymptotic expansion or saddle-point techniques; by contrast, the forward difference series can be extremely hard to evaluate numerically, because the binomial coefficients grow rapidly for large .

The relationship of these higher-order differences with the respective derivatives is straightforward,
formula_22

Higher-order differences can also be used to construct better approximations. As mentioned above, the first-order difference approximates the first-order derivative up to a term of order . However, the combination
formula_23
approximates up to a term of order . This can be proven by expanding the above expression in Taylor series, or by using the calculus of finite differences, explained below.

If necessary, the finite difference can be centered about any point by mixing forward, backward, and central differences.

==Polynomials==
For a given polynomial of degree , expressed in the function , with real numbers and and &quot;lower order terms&quot; (if any) marked as :
formula_24

After pairwise differences, the following result can be achieved, where is a real number marking the arithmetic difference:
formula_25

Only the coefficient of the highest-order term remains. As this result is constant with respect to , any further pairwise differences will have the value .

===Inductive proof===
====Base case====
Let be a polynomial of degree :
formula_26

This proves it for the base case.

====Inductive step====
Let be a polynomial of degree where and the coefficient of the highest-order term be . Assuming the following holds true for all polynomials of degree :
formula_27

Let be a polynomial of degree . With one pairwise difference:
formula_28

As , this results in a polynomial of degree , with as the coefficient of the highest-order term. Given the assumption above and pairwise differences (resulting in a total of pairwise differences for ), it can be found that:
formula_29

This completes the proof.

===Application===
This identity can be used to find the lowest-degree polynomial that intercepts a number of points where the difference on the &quot;x&quot;-axis from one point to the next is a constant . For example, given the following points:

We can use a differences table, where for all cells to the right of the first , the following relation to the cells in the column immediately to the left exists for a cell , with the top-leftmost cell being at coordinate :
formula_30

To find the first term, the following table can be used:

This arrives at a constant . The arithmetic difference is , as established above. Given the number of pairwise differences needed to reach the constant, it can be surmised this is a polynomial of degree . Thus, using the identity above:
formula_31

Solving for , it can be found to have the value . Thus, the first term of the polynomial is .

Then, subtracting out the first term, which lowers the polynomial&#x27;s degree, and finding the finite difference again:

Here, the constant is achieved after only two pairwise differences, thus the following result:
formula_32

Solving for , which is , the polynomial&#x27;s second term is .

Moving on to the next term, by subtracting out the second term:

Thus the constant is achieved after only one pairwise difference:
formula_33

It can be found that and thus the third term of the polynomial is . Subtracting out the third term:

Without any pairwise differences, it is found that the 4th and final term of the polynomial is the constant . Thus, the lowest-degree polynomial intercepting all the points in the first table is found:
formula_34

==Arbitrarily sized kernels==

Using linear algebra one can construct finite difference approximations which utilize an arbitrary number of points to the left and a (possibly different) number of points to the right of the evaluation point, for any order derivative. This involves solving a linear system such that the Taylor expansion of the sum of those points around the evaluation point best approximates the Taylor expansion of the desired derivative. Such formulas can be represented graphically on a hexagonal or diamond-shaped grid.
This is useful for differentiating a function on a grid, where, as one approaches the edge of the grid, one must sample fewer and fewer points on one side.
Finite difference approximations for non-standard (and even non-integer) stencils given an arbitrary stencil and a desired derivative order may be constructed.

===Properties===
* For all positive and formula_35
* Leibniz rule: formula_36

==In differential equations==

An important application of finite differences is in numerical analysis, especially in numerical differential equations, which aim at the numerical solution of ordinary and partial differential equations. The idea is to replace the derivatives appearing in the differential equation by finite differences that approximate them. The resulting methods are called finite difference methods.

Common applications of the finite difference method are in computational science and engineering disciplines, such as thermal engineering, fluid mechanics, etc.

==Newton&#x27;s series==
The Newton series consists of the terms of the Newton forward difference equation, named after Isaac Newton; in essence, it is the Gregory–Newton interpolation formula (named after Isaac Newton and James Gregory), first published in his &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; in 1687, namely the discrete analog of the continuous Taylor expansion,
which holds for any polynomial function and for many (but not all) analytic functions. (It does not hold when is exponential type formula_37. This is easily seen, as the sine function vanishes at integer multiples of formula_37; the corresponding Newton series is identically zero, as all finite differences are zero in this case. Yet clearly, the sine function is not zero.) Here, the expression
formula_39
is the binomial coefficient, and
formula_40
is the &quot;falling factorial&quot; or &quot;lower factorial&quot;, while the empty product is defined to be 1. In this particular case, there is an assumption of unit steps for the changes in the values of of the generalization below.

Note the formal correspondence of this result to Taylor&#x27;s theorem. Historically, this, as well as the Chu–Vandermonde identity, 
formula_41
(following from it, and corresponding to the binomial theorem), are included in the observations that matured to the system of umbral calculus.

Newton series expansions can be superior to Taylor series expansions when applied to discrete quantities like quantum spins (see Holstein–Primakoff transformation), bosonic operator functions or discrete counting statistics.

To illustrate how one may use Newton&#x27;s formula in actual practice, consider the first few terms of doubling the Fibonacci sequence One can find a polynomial that reproduces these values, by first computing a difference table, and then substituting the differences that correspond to (underlined) into the formula as follows,
formula_42

For the case of nonuniform steps in the values of , Newton computes the divided differences,
formula_43
the series of products,
formula_44
and the resulting polynomial is the scalar product,
formula_45

In analysis with -adic numbers, Mahler&#x27;s theorem states that the assumption that is a polynomial function can be weakened all the way to the assumption that is merely continuous.

Carlson&#x27;s theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for a Newton series to be unique, if it exists. However, a Newton series does not, in general, exist.

The Newton series, together with the Stirling series and the Selberg series, is a special case of the general difference series, all of which are defined in terms of suitably scaled forward differences.

In a compressed and slightly more general form and equidistant nodes the formula reads
formula_46

==Calculus of finite differences==

The forward difference can be considered as an operator, called the difference operator, which maps the function to . This operator amounts to formula_47 where is the shift operator with step , defined by and is the identity operator.

The finite difference of higher orders can be defined in recursive manner as Another equivalent definition is 

The difference operator is a linear operator, as such it satisfies 

It also satisfies a special Leibniz rule:
:formula_48
Similar Leibniz rules hold for the backward and central differences.

Formally applying the Taylor series with respect to , yields the operator equation
formula_49
where denotes the conventional, continuous derivative operator, mapping to its derivative The expansion is valid when both sides act on analytic functions, for sufficiently small ; in the special case that the series of derivatives terminates (when the function operated on is a finite polynomial) the expression is exact, for &quot;all&quot; finite stepsizes, Thus and formally inverting the exponential yields 
formula_50
This formula holds in the sense that both operators give the same result when applied to a polynomial.

Even for analytic functions, the series on the right is not guaranteed to converge; it may be an asymptotic series. However, it can be used to obtain more accurate approximations for the derivative. For instance, retaining the first two terms of the series yields the second-order approximation to mentioned at the end of the section &quot;&quot;.

The analogous formulas for the backward and central difference operators are
formula_51

The calculus of finite differences is related to the umbral calculus of combinatorics. This remarkably systematic correspondence is due to the identity of the commutators of the umbral quantities to their continuum analogs ( limits),

A large number of formal differential relations of standard calculus involving 
functions thus &quot;systematically map to umbral finite-difference analogs&quot; involving 

For instance, the umbral analog of a monomial is a generalization of the above falling factorial (Pochhammer k-symbol), 
formula_52 
so that 
formula_53
hence the above Newton interpolation formula (by matching coefficients in the expansion of an arbitrary function in such symbols), and so on.

For example, the umbral sine is
formula_54

As in the continuum limit, the eigenfunction of    also happens to be an exponential,

:formula_55

and hence &quot;Fourier sums of continuum functions are readily, faithfully mapped to umbral Fourier sums&quot;, i.e., involving the same Fourier coefficients multiplying these umbral basis exponentials. This umbral exponential thus amounts to the exponential generating function of the Pochhammer symbols.

Thus, for instance, the Dirac delta function maps to its umbral correspondent, the cardinal sine function 
formula_56
and so forth. Difference equations can often be solved with techniques very similar to those for solving differential equations.

The inverse operator of the forward difference operator, so then the umbral integral, is the indefinite sum or antidifference operator.

===Rules for calculus of finite difference operators===
Analogous to rules for finding the derivative, we have:
* Constant rule: If is a constant, then formula_57
* Linearity: If and are constants, formula_58

All of the above rules apply equally well to any difference operator as to , including and 

* Product rule: formula_59
* Quotient rule: formula_60 or formula_61
* Summation rules: formula_62

See references.

==Generalizations==

*A generalized finite difference is usually defined as formula_63 where is its coefficient vector. An infinite difference is a further generalization, where the finite sum above is replaced by an infinite series. Another way of generalization is making coefficients depend on point : , thus considering weighted finite difference. Also one may make the step depend on point : . Such generalizations are useful for constructing different modulus of continuity.
*The generalized difference can be seen as the polynomial rings . It leads to difference algebras.
*Difference operator generalizes to Möbius inversion over a partially ordered set.
*As a convolution operator: Via the formalism of incidence algebras, difference operators and other Möbius inversion can be represented by convolution with a function on the poset, called the Möbius function ; for the difference operator, is the sequence .

==Multivariate finite differences==

Finite differences can be considered in more than one variable. They are analogous to partial derivatives in several variables.

Some partial derivative approximations are:
formula_64

Alternatively, for applications in which the computation of is the most costly step, and both first and second derivatives must be computed, a more efficient formula for the last case is
formula_65
since the only values to compute that are not already needed for the previous four equations are and .

<text>Frederic William Henry Myers (6 February 1843 – 17 January 1901) was a British poet, classicist, philologist, and a founder of the Society for Psychical Research. Myers&#x27; work on psychical research and his ideas about a &quot;subliminal self&quot; were influential in his time, but have not been accepted by the scientific community.

==Early life==
Myers was born on 6 February 1843 at St John&#x27;s parsonage, Keswick, Cumberland, the son of Revd Frederic Myers (1811–1851) and his second wife Susan Harriet Myers &quot;nee&quot; Marshall (1811–1896). He was a brother of poet Ernest Myers (1844–1921) and of Dr. Arthur Thomas Myers (1851–1894). His maternal grandfather was the wealthy industrialist John Marshall (1765–1845).

Myers was educated at Cheltenham College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he received a B.A. in 1864, and university prizes, including the Bell, Craven, Camden and Chancellor&#x27;s Medal, though he was forced to resign the Camden medal for 1863 after accusations of plagiarism. He was a Fellow of Trinity College from 1865 to 1874 and college lecturer in classics from 1865 to 1869. In 1872 he became an Inspector of schools.

In 1867, Myers published a long poem, &quot;St Paul&quot;, which includes the words of the hymn &quot;Hark what a sound, and too divine for hearing&quot;. This was followed in 1882 by &quot;The Renewal of Youth and Other Poems&quot;. He also wrote books of literary criticism, in particular, &quot;Wordsworth&quot; (1881) and &quot;Essays, Classical and Modern&quot; (in two volumes, 1883), which included an essay on Virgil.

==Personal life==
As a young man, Myers was involved in homosexual relationships with Arthur Sidgwick, the poet John Addington Symonds, and possibly Lord Battersea. He later fell in love with Annie Eliza, the wife of his cousin Walter James Marshall. Myers&#x27; relationship with his cousin&#x27;s wife has been questioned by different researchers to be sexual or Platonic. Annie committed suicide in September 1876 by drowning.

The British writer on the occult Richard Cavendish commented: &quot;According to his own statement, he [Myers] had very strong sexual inclinations, which he indulged. These would seem to have been mainly homosexual in his youth, but in later life, he was said to be wholly heterosexual.&quot; In 1880, Myers married Eveleen Tennant (1856–1937), daughter of Charles Tennant and Gertrude Tennant. They had two sons, the elder the novelist Leopold Hamilton Myers (1881–1944), and a daughter. English author Ronald Pearsall suggested that Myers had sexual interests in young lady mediums, writing &quot;[I]t is certainly true that Myers&#x27;s interest in young lady mediums was not solely due to their spiritualistic talents.&quot;

The researcher Trevor H. Hall argued that Myers had an affair with the medium Ada Goodrich Freer. However, Trevor Hamilton dismissed this and suggested that Freer was simply using her acquaintance with Myers to gain status in the psychical research movement. John Grant has suggested that Myers was a womaniser who was easily duped and &quot;probably seduced&quot; by Freer.&quot;

Biographer Bart Schultz wrote that &quot;Myers was suspected of all manner of sexual quirks and it was alleged that he looked upon psychical research as giving him opportunities for voyeurism.&quot; He also noted the odd behaviour of Myers, such as insisting to be with Edmund Gurney with his bride on their Honeymoon even against strong protest from the bride.

A relationship between eroticism and Myer&#x27;s interest in psychical research was examined by Professor of Philosophy Jeffrey J. Kripal.

Biographer Trevor Hamilton has defended Myer&#x27;s against the allegations of sexual misconduct.

==Psychical research==

Myers was interested in psychical research and was one of the founding members of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) in 1883. He became the President in 1900. Myers psychical ideas and theory of a subliminal self did not impress contemporary psychologists. Psychologists who shared an interest in psychical research such as Théodore Flournoy and William James were influenced by Myers. However, according to historian Janet Oppenheim &quot;not even all Myer&#x27;s colleagues at the SPR accepted his hypotheses.&quot;

Some historians have suggested that Myers was strongly biased to believe in the paranormal and held a secret religious agenda. After the publication of Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859), it was difficult for those with a scientific education to retain a belief in tenets of the Judeo-Christian religion. Early SPR members like Myers and Henry Sidgwick hoped to cling to something spiritual through psychical research. Psychical researcher Eric Dingwall wrote regarding the early formation of the Society for Psychical Research, &quot;Myers, among others... knew that the primary aim of the society was not objective experimentation but the establishment of telepathy.&quot;

British historian G.R. Searle described Myers as &quot;having lost his Christian faith, sought a new kind of religion that could reassure him that death did not lead to extinction.&quot;

===Mediums and psychics===

In opposition to Richard Hodgson and Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick who held the view that many physical mediums were fraudulent, Myers believed that although many of these mediums cheated they could also produce genuine physical phenomena. According to Trevor Hamilton &quot;Myers had no direct involvement in the exposure of physical fraud.&quot;

In the late 19th century Douglas Blackburn and George Albert Smith were endorsed as genuine psychics by Myers and Edmund Gurney. Smith even became an SPR member himself and the private secretary to the Honorary Secretary Gurney from 1883 to 1888. However, Blackburn later confessed to fraud. Blackburn called Gurney and Myers a &quot;couple of credulous spiritualists&quot; and wrote &quot;we resolved that we should be doing the world a service by fooling them to the top of their bent, and then showing how easy a matter it was to &#x27;take in&#x27; scientific observers.&quot;

Myers&#x27; 1884 essay &quot;Visible Apparitions&quot; with Gurney claimed a &quot;personal experience&quot; by a retired Judge Edmund Hornby involving a visitation from a spirit was true, but Joseph McCabe wrote that the story was a &quot;jumble of inaccuracies&quot; and &quot;Sir E. Hornby was compelled to admit, that the story was entirely untrue.&quot;

In July 1895, Eusapia Palladino was invited to England to Myers&#x27; house in Cambridge for a series of investigations into her mediumship. According to reports by the investigators such as Richard Hodgson and magician John Nevil Maskelyne, all the phenomena observed in the Cambridge sittings were the result of trickery. Her fraud was so clever, according to Myers, that it &quot;must have needed long practice to bring it to its present level of skill.&quot; However, despite the exposure of her fraud, Myers was convinced some of her phenomena was genuine.

Clinical neurologist Sebastian Dieguez has commented that Myers &quot;was seriously duped by many people&quot;.

===Phantasms of the living===

Myers was the co-author of the two-volume &quot;Phantasms of the Living&quot; (1886) with Gurney and Frank Podmore which documented alleged sightings of apparitions. Myers wrote an introduction and concluding chapter. The two volumes consist of 701 cases of alleged spontaneous apparitional communications. It also explored a telepathic theory to explain such cases. Psychical researcher Thomas Walker Mitchell commented that &quot;the chief aim of [the] book was to produce a cumulative quasi-statistical proof of telepathy.&quot; It was enthusiastically praised by psychologist William James as a &quot;most extraordinary work...exhibiting untiring zeal in collecting facts, and patience in seeking to make them accurate.&quot;

Some scholars, however, criticised &quot;Phantasms of the Living&quot; for its lack of written testimony and the time elapsed between the occurrence and the report of it being made. Some of the reports were analysed by the German hallucination researcher Edmund Parish (1861–1916) who concluded they were evidence for a dream state of consciousness, not the paranormal. Charles Sanders Peirce wrote a long criticism of the book arguing that no scientific conclusion could be reached from anecdotes and stories of unanalyzed phenomena. Peirce argued that the stories were &quot;worthless, partly because of the uncertainty and error of the numerical data, and partly because the authors have been astonishingly careless in the admission of cases ruled out by the conditions of the argumentation.&quot;

A strong attack on the book was made by physiologist William Thierry Preyer. Mathematician Simon Newcomb noted that there were many possible natural explanations for the stories including &quot;unconscious exaggeration; the faculty of remembering what is striking and forgetting what is not; illusions of sense, mistakes of memory; the impressions left by dreams; and, finally, deceit and trickery, whether intentional or unconscious.&quot; Because of all these possible factors that were not ruled out, he concluded &quot;there is therefore no proof of telepathy in any of the wonders narrated in these volumes.&quot;

Alexander Taylor Innes attacked the book due to the stories lacking evidential substantiation in nearly every case. According to Innes the alleged sightings of apparitions were unreliable as they rested upon the memory of the witnesses and no contemporary documents had been produced, even in cases where such documents were alleged to exist. Edmund Gurney replied to the criticism, but &quot;could only point to three cases that met Innes&#x27;s requirements, one of which later turned out to be fraud&quot;.

Another major criticism of the book was that it endorsed the tests of the Creery Sisters as genuine evidence for telepathy. However, in 1887 two of the sisters had been detected in fraud, utilising a code of signals and the third sister confessed to using the signals in the experiments. The psychologist C. E. M. Hansel noted that the stories in &quot;Phantasms of the Living&quot; were not backed up by any corroborating evidence. Hansel concluded &quot;none of the stories investigated has withstood critical examination.&quot;

Shane McCorristine in his book &quot;Spectres of the Self&quot; (2010), explores the criticisms of &quot;Phantasms of the Living&quot; in depth.

===Human personality and its survival of bodily death===

Myers wrote a small collection of essays, &quot;Science and a Future Life&quot; which was published in 1893. In 1903, after Myers&#x27;s death, &quot;Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death&quot; was compiled and published. This work comprises two large volumes at 1,360 pages in length and presents an overview of Myers&#x27;s research into the unconscious mind. Myers believed that a theory of consciousness must be part of a unified model of mind which derives from the full range of human experience, including not only normal psychological phenomena but also a wide variety of abnormal and &quot;supernormal&quot; phenomena. In the book, Myers believed he had provided evidence for the existence of the soul and survival of personality after death. The book cites cases of automatic writing, hypnotism, mediumship, possession, psychokinesis, and telepathy.

In &quot;Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death&quot;, Myers speculated on the existence of a deep region of the subconscious mind, which he termed the &quot;subliminal self&quot;, which he believed could account for paranormal events. He also proposed the existence of a &quot;metetherial world,&quot; a world of images lying beyond the physical world. He wrote that apparitions are not hallucinations but have a real existence in the metetherial world which he described as a dream-like world. Myers’ belief that apparitions occupied regions of physical space and had an objective existence was in opposition to the views of his co-authors Gurney and Podmore who wrote apparitions were telepathic hallucinations.

It was well received by parapsychologists and spiritualists, being described as &quot;the Bible of British psychical researchers&quot;. Théodore Flournoy and William James both positively reviewed the book. It was negatively reviewed by psychologist George Stout who described the concept of the subliminal self as &quot;baseless, futile, and incoherent.&quot; Andrew Lang and Gerald Balfour were unconvinced about some of Myers ideas. William McDougall in a detailed review for &quot;Mind&quot; also criticised the book. French psychologist Henri Delacroix commented that Myers &quot;experimental metaphysics&quot; was a failure. Psychologist G. T. W. Patrick criticised Myers concepts as a &quot;metaphysical, not a psychological hypothesis.&quot;

Myers&#x27; book greatly impressed Aldous Huxley. In 1961, &quot;Human Personality&quot; was re-published as an abridged version with Huxley&#x27;s foreword, in which he remarked &quot;an amazingly rich, profound and stimulating book.&quot;

Strong praise for the book and a revival of interest in Myers&#x27; ideas appeared in the 2007 &quot;Irreducible Mind&quot; by Emily Williams Kelly, Alan Gauld and Bruce Greyson.

==Death==

In each of 1898, 1899, and 1900 Myers had severe attacks of influenza and also developed Bright&#x27;s disease. At the end of 1900 he travelled abroad to try to restore his health. He died of pneumonia in Rome on 17 January 1901. Myers was buried in the graveyard of St John&#x27;s Church, Keswick, between his father&#x27;s grave and a gateway into the garden of the house where he was born. He was survived by his wife. A memorial tablet to Myers was erected in Rome&#x27;s Protestant cemetery.

<doc id="39155" wikidata="Q344005" url="?curid=39155" title="ActiveX Data Objects">
<text>In computing, Microsoft&#x27;s ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) comprises a set of Component Object Model (COM) objects for accessing data sources. A part of MDAC (Microsoft Data Access Components), it provides a middleware layer between programming languages and OLE DB (a means of accessing data stores, whether databases or not, in a uniform manner). ADO allows a developer to write programs that access data without knowing how the database is implemented; developers must be aware of the database for connection only. No knowledge of SQL is required to access a database when using ADO, although one can use ADO to execute SQL commands directly (with the disadvantage of introducing a dependency upon the type of database used).

Microsoft introduced ADO in October 1996, positioning the software as a successor to Microsoft&#x27;s earlier object layers for accessing data sources, including RDO (Remote Data Objects) and DAO (Data Access Objects).

ADO is made up of four collections and twelve objects.

==ADO collections==

; Fields

: This collection contains a set of Field objects. The Collection can be used in either a Recordset object or in a Record object. In a Recordset object, each of the Field objects that make up the Fields collection corresponds to a column in that Record set object. In a Record object, a Field can be an absolute or relative URL that points into a tree-structured namespace (used for semi-structured data providers like the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Internet Publishing) or as a reference to the default Stream object associated with that Record object.
; Properties

: An object can have more than one Property object, which are contained in the object&#x27;s Properties collection.
; Parameters

: A Command object can have several Parameter commands to change its predefined behaviour, and each of the Parameter objects are contained in the Command object&#x27;s Parameters collection
; Errors

: All provider-created errors are passed to a collection of Error objects, while the Errors collection itself is contained in a Connection object. When an ADO operation creates an error, the collection is cleared and a new group of Error objects is created in the collection.

==ADO objects==

; Connection
: The connection object is ADO&#x27;s connection to a data store via OLE DB. The connection object stores information about the session and provides methods of connecting to the data store. As some data stores have different methods of establishing a connection, some methods may not be supported in the connection object for particular OLE DB provider. A connection object connects to the data store using its &#x27;Open&#x27; method with a connection string which specifies the connection as a list of key value pairs (for example: &quot;Provider=&#x27;SQLOLEDB&#x27;;Data Source=&#x27;TheSqlServer&#x27;; Initial Catalog=&#x27;Northwind&#x27;;Integrated Security=&#x27;SSPI&#x27;;&quot;). The start of this connection string must identify the type of data store connection that the connection object requires:
:* an OLE DB provider (for example SQLOLEDB), using the syntax &quot;provider=&quot;;
:* a file name, using the syntax &quot;file name=&quot;;
:* a remote provider and server (see RDS), using the syntax &quot;Remote provider=&quot; and &quot;Remote server=&quot;; or
:* an absolute URL, using the syntax &quot;URL=&quot;
; Command
: After the connection object establishes a session to the data source, instructions are sent to the data provider via the command object. The command object can send SQL queries directly to the provider through the use of the CommandText property, send a parameterised query or stored procedure through the use of a Parameter object or Parameters collection or run a query and return the results to a dataset object via the Execute method. There are several other methods that can be used in the Command object relating to other objects, such as the Stream, RecordSet or Connection objects.
; Recordset
: A recordset is a group of records, and can either come from a base table or as the result of a query to the table. The RecordSet object contains a Fields collection and a Properties collection. The Fields collection is a set of Field objects, which are the corresponding columns in the table. The Properties collection is a set of Property objects, which defines a particular functionality of an OLE DB provider. The RecordSet has numerous methods and properties for examining the data that exists within it. Records can be updated in the recordset by changing the values in the record and then calling on the Update or UpdateBatch method. 
; Immediate
: The recordset is locked using the adLockOptimistic or adLockPessimistic lock. The data are updated at the data source after the record is changed and the Update method is called.
; Batch
: The recordset is locked using adLockBatchOptimistic and each time Update is called the data are updated in a temporary buffer. Finally, when UpdateBatch is called the data are completely updated back at the data source. This has the advantage of it all being done in memory, and if a problem occurs then UpdateCancel is called and the updates are not sent to the data source.
; Transaction
: If the OLE DB provider allows it, transactions can be used. To start the transaction, the programmer invokes the BeginTrans method and does the required updates. When they are all done, the programmer invokes the CommitTrans method. RollbackTrans can be invoked to cancel any changes made inside the transaction and roll back the database to the state before the transaction began.
; Record
: This object represents one record in the database and contains a fields collection. A RecordSet consists of a collection of Record objects.
; Stream
: A stream, mainly used in a RecordSet object, is a means of reading and writing a stream of bytes. It is mostly used to save a recordset in an XML format, to send commands to an OLE DB provider as an alternative to the CommandText object and to contain the contents of a binary or text file.
; Parameter
: A parameter is a means of altering the behaviour of a common piece of functionality, for instance a stored procedure might have different parameters passed to it depending on what needs to be done; these are called parameterised commands.
; Field
: Each Record object contains many fields, and a RecordSet object has a corresponding Field object also. The RecordSet object&#x27;s Field object corresponds to a column in the database table that it references.
; Property
: This object is specific to the OLE DB provider and defines an ability that the provider has implemented. A property object can be either a built-in property — it is a well-defined property implemented by ADO already and thus cannot be altered — or can be a dynamic property — defined by the underlying data provider and can be changed
; Error
: When an OLE DB provider error occurs during the use of ADO, an Error object will be created in the Errors collection. Other errors do not go into an Error object, however. For instance, any errors that occur when manipulating data in a RecordSet or Field object are stored in a Status property.

== Basic usage ==
Some basic steps are required in order to be able to access and manipulate data using ADO :
#Create a connection object to connect to the database.
#Create a recordset object in order to receive data in.
#Open the connection
#Populate the recordset by opening it and passing the desired table name or SQL statement as a parameter to &quot;open&quot; function.
#Do all the desired searching/processing on the fetched data.
#Commit the changes you made to the data (if any) by using &quot;Update&quot; or &quot;UpdateBatch&quot; methods.
#Close the recordset
#Close the connection

=== ASP example ===

Here is an ASP example using ADO to select the &quot;Name&quot; field, from a table called &quot;Phonebook&quot;, where a &quot;PhoneNumber&quot; was equal to &quot;555-5555&quot;.
dim myconnection, myrecordset, name
set myconnection = server.createobject(&quot;ADODB.Connection&quot;)
set myrecordset = server.createobject(&quot;ADODB.Recordset&quot;)

myconnection.open mydatasource
myrecordset.open &quot;Phonebook&quot;, myconnection 
myrecordset.find &quot;PhoneNumber = &#x27;555-5555&#x27;&quot;
name = myrecordset.fields.item(&quot;Name&quot;)
myrecordset.close

set myrecordset = nothing
set myconnection = nothing
This is equivalent to the following ASP code, which uses plain SQL instead of the functionality of the Recordset object:

dim myconnection, myrecordset, name
set myconnection = server.createobject(&quot;ADODB.connection&quot;)
myconnection.open mydatasource
set myrecordset = myconnection.execute(&quot;SELECT Name FROM Phonebook WHERE PhoneNumber = &#x27;555-5555&#x27;&quot;)
name = myrecordset(0)
==Software support==
ADO is supported in any development language that supports binding to binary COM interfaces. These languages include ASP, Delphi, PowerBuilder, and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). ADO support has now been added to dBase Plus 8 (With ADO)

==Legacy==
ADO.NET has replaced ADO in the same way that C#/.NET replaced C/Win32 as the primary mode for targeting Windows application development. ADO.NET follows the same design pattern as ADO, enabling an ADO developer an easy path forward when moving to the .NET framework.

<doc id="39159" wikidata="Q272990" url="?curid=39159" title="Mace (bludgeon)">
<text>A mace is a blunt weapon, a type of club or virge that uses a heavy head on the end of a handle to deliver powerful strikes. A mace typically consists of a strong, heavy, wooden or metal shaft, often reinforced with metal, featuring a head made of stone, bone, copper, bronze, iron, or steel.

The head of a mace can be shaped with flanges or knobs to increase the pressure of an impact by focusing the force on a small point. They would bind on metal instead of sliding around it, allowing them to deliver more force to an armored opponent than a traditional mace. This effect increased the potential for the mace to injure an armored opponent through weak spots in the armor, and even damage plate armor by denting it, potentially binding overlapping plates and impeding the wearer&#x27;s range of motion. Medieval historian and re-enactor Todd Todeschini (AKA Todd Cutler) demonstrated this effect with period accurate equipment in a series of tests on video. 

Maces are rarely used today for actual combat, but many government bodies (for instance, the British House of Commons and the U.S. Congress), universities and other institutions have ceremonial maces and continue to display them as symbols of authority. They are often paraded in academic, parliamentary or civic rituals and processions.

==Etymology==
The modern English word &quot;mace&quot; entered Middle English from Old French &quot;mace,&quot; (&quot;large mallet/sledgehammer, mace&quot;) itself from a Vulgar Latin term &quot;*mattia&quot; or &quot;*mattea&quot; (cf. Italian &quot;mazza,&quot; &quot;club, baton, mace&quot;), probably from Latin &quot;mateola&quot; (uncertain, possibly a kind of club, hammer, or &quot;hoe handle/stick&quot;). Possibly influenced by Latin &quot;mattiobarbulus&quot; (&quot;type of javelin&quot;), &quot;mattiarius&quot; (&quot;soldier armed with said javelin&quot;), from &quot;mataris, matara&quot; (&quot;Gallic javelin&quot;), from a Gaulish or Celtic word.

==Development history==
===Prehistory===
The mace was developed during the Upper Paleolithic from the simple club, by adding sharp spikes of either flint or obsidian.

In Europe, an elaborately carved ceremonial flint mace head was one of the artifacts discovered in excavations of the Neolithic mound of Knowth in Ireland, and Bronze Age archaeology cites numerous finds of perforated mace heads.

In ancient Ukraine, stone mace heads were first used nearly eight millennia ago. The others known were disc maces with oddly formed stones mounted perpendicularly to their handle. The Narmer Palette shows a king swinging a mace. See the articles on the Narmer Macehead and the Scorpion Macehead for examples of decorated maces inscribed with the names of kings.

The problem with early maces was that their stone heads shattered easily and it was difficult to fix the head to the wooden handle reliably. The Egyptians attempted to give them a disk shape in the predynastic period (about 3850–3650 BC) in order to increase their impact and even provide some cutting capabilities, but this seems to have been a short-lived improvement.

A rounded pear form of mace head known as a &quot;piriform&quot; replaced the disc mace in the Naqada II period of pre-dynastic Upper Egypt (3600–3250 BC) and was used throughout the Naqada III period (3250–3100 BC). Similar mace heads were also used in Mesopotamia around 2450–1900 BC. On a Sumerian Clay tablet written by the scribe Gar.Ama, the title Lord of the Mace is listed in the year 3100 BC. The Assyrians used maces probably about nineteenth century BC and in their campaigns; the maces were usually made of stone or marble and furnished with gold or other metals, but were rarely used in battle unless fighting heavily armoured infantry.

An important, later development in mace heads was the use of metal for their composition. With the advent of copper mace heads, they no longer shattered and a better fit could be made to the wooden club by giving the eye of the mace head the shape of a cone and using a tapered handle.

The Shardanas or warriors from Sardinia who fought for Ramses II against the Hittites were armed with maces consisting of wooden sticks with bronze heads. Many bronze statuettes of the times show Sardinian warriors carrying swords, bows and original maces.

===Ancient history===
Persians used a variety of maces and fielded large numbers of heavily armoured and armed cavalry (see Cataphract). For a heavily armed Persian knight, a mace was as effective as a sword or battle axe. In fact, Shahnameh has many references to heavily armoured knights facing each other using maces, axes, and swords. The enchanted talking mace Sharur made its first appearance in Sumerian/Akkadian mythology during the epic of Ninurta.

The Indian epics &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot; describe the extensive use of the &quot;gada&quot; in ancient Indian warfare as gada-yuddha or &#x27;mace combat&#x27;.

The ancient Romans did not make wide use of maces, probably because of the influence of armour, and due to the nature of the Roman infantry&#x27;s fighting style which involved the &quot;Pilum&quot; (spear) and the &quot;Gladius&quot; (short sword used in a stabbing fashion), though auxiliaries from Syria Palestina were armed with clubs and maces at the battles of Immae and Emesa in 272 AD. They proved highly effective against the heavily armoured horsemen of Palmyra.

===Post classical history===
====Western Europe====

During the Middle Ages metal armour such as mail protected against the blows of edged weapons. Though iron became increasingly common, copper and bronze were also used, especially in iron-deficient areas.

One example of a mace capable of penetrating armour is the flanged mace. The flanges allow it to dent or penetrate thick armour. Flange maces did not become popular until after knobbed maces. Although there are some references to flanged maces (&quot;bardoukion&quot;) as early as the Byzantine Empire c. 900 it is commonly accepted that the flanged mace did not become popular in Europe until the 12th century, when it was concurrently developed in Russia and Mid-west Asia.

Maces, being simple to make, cheap, and straightforward in application, were quite common weapons.

It is popularly believed that maces were employed by the clergy in warfare to avoid shedding blood (&quot;sine effusione sanguinis&quot;). The evidence for this is sparse and appears to derive almost entirely from the depiction of Bishop Odo of Bayeux wielding a club-like mace at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 in the Bayeux Tapestry, the idea being that he did so to avoid either shedding blood or bearing the arms of war.

In the 1893 work &quot;Arms and Armour in Antiquity and the Middle Ages&quot;, Paul Lacombe and Charles Boutell state that the mace was chiefly used for blows struck upon the head of an enemy.

====Eastern Europe====

Eastern European maces often had pear shaped heads. These maces were also used by the Moldavian ruler Stephen the Great in some of his wars (see Bulawa).

The mace is also the favourite weapon of Prince Marko, a hero in South Slavic epic poetry.

The pernach was a type of flanged mace developed since the 12th century in the region of Kievan Rus&#x27;, and later widely used throughout the whole of Europe. The name comes from the Slavic word &quot;pero&quot; (&quot;перо&quot;) meaning feather, reflecting the form of pernach that resembled a fletched arrow. Pernachs were the first form of the flanged mace to enjoy a wide usage. It was well suited to penetrate plate armour and chain mail. In the later times it was often used as a symbol of power by the military leaders in Eastern Europe.

====Pre-Columbian America====
The cultures of pre-Columbian America used clubs and maces extensively. The warriors of the Moche state and the Inca Empire used maces with bone, stone or copper heads and wooden shafts. The quauholōlli was used in Mesoamerica.

====Asia====

Maces in Asia were most often steel clubs with a spherical head. In Persia, the &quot;Gorz&quot; (spherical-head mace) served as a primary combat arm across many eras, most often being used by heavy infantry or Cataphracts. In India a form of these clubs was used by wrestlers to exercise the arms and shoulders. They have been known as gada since ancient times.

During the Mughal era, the flanged mace of Persia was introduced to South Asia. The term &quot;shishpar&quot; is a Persian phrase which literally translates to &quot;six-wings&quot;, to refer to the (often) six flanges on the mace. The shishpar mace was introduced by the Delhi Sultanate and continued to be utilized until the 18th century.

===Modern history===
Trench raiding clubs used during World War I were modern variations on the medieval mace. They were homemade mêlée weapons used by both the Allies and the Central Powers. Clubs were used during night time trench raiding expeditions as a quiet and effective way of killing or wounding enemy soldiers.

Makeshift maces were also found in the possession of some football hooligans in the 1980s.

In 2020 China–India skirmishes personnel of People&#x27;s Liberation Army Ground Force were seen using makeshift maces (batons wrapped in barbed wire and clubs embedded with nails).

==Ceremonial use==

Maces have had a role in ceremonial practices over time, including some still in use today.

===Parliamentary maces===

The ceremonial mace is a short, richly ornamented staff often made of silver, the upper part of which is furnished with a knob or other head-piece and decorated with a coat of arms. The ceremonial mace was commonly borne before eminent ecclesiastical corporations, magistrates, and academic bodies as a mark and symbol of jurisdiction.

Ceremonial maces are important in many parliaments following the Westminster system. They are carried in by the sergeant-at-arms or some other mace-bearers and displayed on the clerks&#x27; table while parliament is in session to show that a parliament is fully constituted. They are removed when the session ends. The mace is also removed from the table when a new speaker is being elected to show that parliament is not ready to conduct business.

===Ecclesiastical maces===
Maces may also be carried before clergy members in church processions, although in the case of the Roman Catholic pope and cardinals, they have largely been replaced with processional crosses.

===Parade maces===

Maces are also used as a parade item, rather than a tool of war, notably in military bands. Specific movements of the mace from the drum major will signal specific orders to the band they lead. The mace can signal anything from a step-off to a halt, from the commencement of playing to the cut off.

===University maces===

University maces are employed in a manner similar to parliamentary maces. They symbolize the authority and independence of a chartered university and the authority vested in the provost. They are typically carried in at the beginning of a convocation ceremony and are often less than half a meter high.

==Heraldic use==

Like many weapons from feudal times, maces have been used in heraldic blazons as either a charge on a shield or other item, or as external ornamentation.

Thus, in France:
* the city of Cognac (in the Charente département): &quot;Argent on a horse sable harnessed or a man proper vested azure with a cloak gules holding a mace, on a chief France modern&quot;
* the city of Colmar (in Haut-Rhin): &quot;per pale gules and vert a mace per bend sinister or.&quot; Three maces, probably a canting device (&quot;Kolben&quot; means mace in German, cfr. &quot;Columbaria&quot; the Latin name of the city) appear on a 1214 seal. The arms in a 15th-century stained-glass window show the mace per bend on argent.
* the duke of Retz (a pairie created in 1581 for Albert de Gondy) had &quot;Or two maces or clubs per saltire sable, bound gules&quot;
* the Garde des sceaux (&#x27;keeper of the seals&#x27;, still the formal title of the French Republic&#x27;s Minister of Justice) places behind the shield, two silver and gilded maces in saltire, and the achievement is surmounted by a mortier (magistrate&#x27;s hat)

<text>Toktar Ongarbayuly Aubakirov ( (&quot;Toqtar Oñğarbaiūly Äubäkırov&quot;), , born on 27 July 1946) is a retired Kazakh Air Force officer and a former cosmonaut. He is the first person from Kazakhstan to go to space.

==Early life==
Toktar Aubakirov was born in Karkaraly District, Karaganda Region, Kazakh SSR, which is now Kazakhstan. After graduating from the 8th grade of a secondary school he started working as a metal turner at the Temirtau foundry, whilst attending an evening school. In 1965 he joined the Armavir Military Aviation Institute of the Anti-Air Defence Pilots. He served as a fighter pilot in the Soviet Air Force on the Far East borders of the USSR until his acceptance into the Fedotov Test Pilot School in 1975.

==Test pilot career==
Between 1976 and 1991 Aubakirov served as a test pilot at the Mikoyan Experimental Design Bureau (MiG aircraft). During this time he tested over 50 types of aircraft. He was the first in the Soviet Union to make a nonstop flight crossing the North Pole, with two in-flight refuelings, and the first in the Soviet Union to take off from the aircraft-carrier &quot;Tbilisi&quot; (later named &quot;Kuznetsov&quot;) on a MiG 29K.

==Spaceflight experience==
In 1991, in accordance with an agreement between the governments of the USSR and the Kazakh SSR, started training at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center.

Their mission was the last launched by the Soviet Union, which dissolved shortly thereafter, with Aubakirov becoming a citizen of the independent Republic of Kazakhstan.

<text>The Commonwealth Games is a quadrennial international multi-sport event among athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations, which consists mostly, but not exclusively, of territories of the former British Empire. The event was first held in 1930 as the [[British Empire Games]] and, with the exception of 1942 and 1946 (which were cancelled due to World War II), has successively run every four years since. The event was called the British Empire Games from 1930 to 1950 (four editions), the British Empire and Commonwealth Games from 1954 to 1966 (four editions), and the British Commonwealth Games from 1970 to 1974 (two editions). The event removed the word &quot;British&quot; from its title for the 1978 Games and has maintained its current name ever since (twelve editions as of 2024).

Athletes with a disability have been included as full members of their national teams since 2002, making the Commonwealth Games the first fully inclusive international multi-sport event. In 2018, the Games became the first global multi-sport event to feature an equal number of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s medal events, and four years later they became the first global multi-sport event to have more events for women than men.

Inspired by the Inter-Empire Championships, part of the 1911 Festival of Empire, Melville Marks Robinson founded the British Empire Games which was first held in Hamilton, Canada in 1930. As time progressed, the Games evolved, adding the Commonwealth Paraplegic Games for athletes with a disability (who were barred from competing from 1974 before being fully integrated by 1990) and the Commonwealth Youth Games for athletes aged 14 to 18.

The event is overseen by the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF), which controls the sporting programme and selects host cities. The games movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), Commonwealth Games Associations (CGAs) and organising committees for each specific Commonwealth Games. Certain traditions, such as the hoisting of the Commonwealth Games flag and Queen&#x27;s Baton Relay, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies, are unique to the Games. Near 4900 athletes competed at the latest Commonwealth Games in 20 sports and in 280 medal events, including Olympic and Paralympic sports and certain non-Olympic sports popular in Commonwealth countries: netball, lawn bowls and squash. Usually, the first, second and third-place finishers in each event are awarded gold, silver and bronze medals, respectively. Several sports, such as rugby sevens (2016) have appeared at the Commonwealth Games before later being added to the Olympic schedule, while netball and lawn bowls remain Commonwealth Games sports only.

One of the differences from other multisport events is that fifteen Commonwealth Games Associations (CGA)s participating in the Commonwealth Games do not send their delegations independently to the Olympic, Paralympic and other multisports competitions: thirteen are linked to the British Olympic Association, one is part of the Australian Olympic Committee and another is part of the New Zealand Olympic Committee. They are the four constituent Home Nations of the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), six of the British Overseas Territories (Anguilla, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Montserrat, Saint Helena and Turks and Caicos Islands), the Crown Dependencies (Guernsey, Isle of Man, and Jersey), along with the Australian territory of Norfolk Island and the New Zealand associated state of Niue. Despite being overseas territories rather than sovereign states, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands are National Olympic Committees recognized by the IOC.

Twenty cities in nine countries (counting England, Scotland and Wales as separate Commonwealth Games federations) have hosted the games. Australia has hosted the Commonwealth Games five times (1938, 1962, 1982, 2006 and 2018), more than any other nation. Two cities have hosted Commonwealth Games more than once: Auckland (1950, 1990) and Edinburgh (1970, 1986). Glasgow will be the third city to host the games more than once (2014 and 2026). The most recent Commonwealth Games, the 22nd or &quot;XXII&quot;, was held in Birmingham from 28 July to 8 August 2022.

The confirmation of hosts has become a major issue for the event as the withdrawal of numerous host cities for the 2026 Commonwealth Games led to speculation that the 2022 edition may have been the last. However, the city of Glasgow was confirmed as the host city for the 2026 games in September 2024.

The next Commonwealth Games, the 23rd or &quot;XXIII&quot;, will be held in Glasgow from 23 July to 2 August 2026.

== History ==

A sporting competition bringing together the members of the British Empire was first proposed by John Astley Cooper in 1891, five years before the first modern Olympic Games, who wrote letters and articles for several periodicals suggesting a &quot;Pan Brittanic, Pan Anglican Contest every four years as a means of increasing goodwill and understanding of the British Empire.&quot; John Astley Cooper Committees were formed in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa to promote the idea and inspired Pierre de Coubertin to start the international Olympic Games movement.

In 1911, an Inter-Empire Championship was held alongside the Festival of Empire, at The Crystal Palace in London to celebrate the coronation of George V, and were championed by The Earl of Plymouth and Lord Desborough. Teams from Australasia (Australia and New Zealand), Canada, South Africa, and the United Kingdom competed in events for athletics, boxing, swimming and wrestling. Canada won the championships and was presented with a silver cup (gifted by Lord Lonsdale) which was high and weighed . A correspondent of the &quot;Auckland Star&quot; criticised the Games, calling them a &quot;grievous disappointment&quot; that were &quot;not worthy of the title of &#x27;Empire Sports&#x27;&quot;.

While planning for the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, Amateur Athletic Union of Canada executive J. Howard Crocker spoke with journalist Melville Marks Robinson of &quot;The Hamilton Spectator&quot;, about hosting an international sporting event in Canada. Robinson proposed and lobbied to host what became the British Empire Games in Hamilton, Ontario, in 1930. Robinson then served as the manager of the Canadian track and field team for the 1930 British Empire Games.

Although there are 56 sovereign states that are members of the Commonwealth of Nations, there are 72 Commonwealth Games Associations. They are divided into six regions (Africa, the Americas, the Caribbean, Europe, Asia and Oceania) and each has a similar function to the National Olympic Committees in relation with their countries or territories. In some, like India and South Africa, the CGA functions are assumed by their NOCs.

Only six national federations have participated in every Commonwealth Games: Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, Scotland and Wales. Of these six, Australia, England, Canada and New Zealand have each won at least one gold medal in every Games. Australia has been the highest-achieving team for thirteen editions of the Games, England for seven and Canada for one. These three teams also top the all-time Commonwealth Games medal table in that order.

=== Editions ===

==== British Empire Games ====

The 1930 British Empire Games was the first of what later became known as the Commonwealth Games, and was held in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada from 16 to 23 August 1930 and opened by Lord Willingdon. Eleven countries: Australia, Bermuda, British Guyana, Canada, England, Northern Ireland, Newfoundland, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa and Wales, sent a total of 400 athletes to compete in athletics, boxing, lawn bowls, rowing, swimming and diving and wrestling. The opening and closing ceremonies as well as athletics took place at Civic Stadium. The cost of the Games were $97,973. Women competed in only the aquatic events. Canadian triple jumper Gordon Smallacombe won the first ever gold medal in the history of the Games.

The 1934 British Empire Games was the second of what is now known as the Commonwealth Games, held in London, England. The host city was London, with the main venue at Wembley Park, although the track cycling events were in Manchester. The 1934 Games had originally been awarded to Johannesburg, but was given to London instead because of serious concerns about prejudice against Asian and black athletes in South Africa. The affiliation of Irish athletes at the 1934 Games representation remains unclear but there was no official Irish Free State team. Sixteen national teams took part, including new participants Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Southern Rhodesia and Trinidad and Tobago.

The 1938 British Empire Games was the third British Empire Games, which was held in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It was timed to coincide with Sydney&#x27;s sesqui-centenary (150 years since the foundation of British settlement in Australia). Held in the Southern Hemisphere for the first time, the III Games opening ceremony took place at the famed Sydney Cricket Ground in front of 40,000 spectators. Fifteen nations participated down under at the Sydney Games involving a total of 464 athletes and 43 officials. Fiji and Ceylon made their debuts. Seven sports were featured in the Sydney Games – athletics, boxing, cycling, lawn bowls, rowing, swimming and diving and wrestling.

The 1950 British Empire Games was the fourth edition and was held in Auckland, New Zealand, after a twelve-year gap from the third edition of the games. The fourth games was originally awarded to Montreal, Canada and was to be held in 1942, but was cancelled due to the Second World War. The opening ceremony at Eden Park was attended by 40,000 spectators, while nearly 250,000 people attended the Auckland Games. Twelve countries sent a total of 590 athletes to Auckland. Malaya and Nigeria made their first appearances.

==== British Empire and Commonwealth Games ====
The fifth edition of the Games, the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This was the first event since the name change from British Empire Games took effect in 1952, the same year of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s reign. The fifth edition of the Games placed Vancouver on a world stage and featured memorable sporting moments as well as outstanding entertainment, technical innovation and cultural events. The &#x27;Miracle Mile&#x27;, as it became known, saw both the gold medallist, Roger Bannister of England and silver medallist John Landy of Australia, run sub-four-minute races in an event that was televised live across the world for the first time. Northern Rhodesia and Pakistan made their debuts and both performed well, winning eight and six medals respectively.

The 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games was held in Cardiff, Wales. The sixth edition of the games marked the largest sporting event ever held in Wales and it was the smallest country ever to host a British Empire and Commonwealth Games. Cardiff had to wait twelve years longer than originally scheduled to become host of the Games, as the 1946 event was cancelled because of the Second World War. The Cardiff Games introduced the Queen&#x27;s Baton Relay, which has been conducted as a prelude to every British Empire and Commonwealth Games ever since. Thirty-five nations sent a total of 1,122 athletes and 228 officials to the Cardiff Games and 23 countries and dependencies won medals, including for the first time, Singapore, Ghana, Kenya and the Isle of Man. In the run up to the Cardiff games, many leading sports stars including Stanley Matthews, Jimmy Hill and Don Revie were signatories in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; on 17 July 1958 deploring the presence of white-only South African sports, opposing &#x27;the policy of apartheid&#x27; in international sport and defending &#x27;the principle of racial equality which is embodied in the Declaration of the Olympic Games&#x27;.

The 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games was held in Perth, Western Australia. Thirty-five countries sent a total of 863 athletes and 178 officials to Perth. Jersey was among the medal winners for the first time, while British Honduras, Dominica, Papua and New Guinea and St Lucia all made their inaugural Games appearances. Aden also competed by special invitation. Sarawak, North Borneo and Malaya competed for the last time, before taking part in 1966 under the Malaysian flag. In addition, Rhodesia and Nyasaland competed in the Games as an entity for the first and only time.

The 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games was held in Kingston, Jamaica. This was the first time that the Games had been held outside the so-called White Dominions. Thirty-four nations (including South Arabia) competed in the Kingston Games, sending a total of 1,316 athletes and officials.

==== British Commonwealth Games ====

The 1970 British Commonwealth Games was held in Edinburgh, Scotland. This was the first time the name British Commonwealth Games was adopted, the first time metric units rather than imperial units were used in events, the first time the games were held in Scotland and also the first time that HM Queen Elizabeth II attended in her capacity as Head of the Commonwealth.

The 1974 British Commonwealth Games was held in Christchurch, New Zealand. The event was officially named &quot;The Friendly Games&quot;, and was also the first edition to feature a theme song. Following the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, the tenth games at Christchurch were the first multi-sport event to place the safety of participants and spectators as its uppermost requirement. Security guards surrounded the athlete&#x27;s village and there was an exceptionally high-profile police presence. Only 22 countries succeeded in winning medals from the total haul of 374 medals on offer, but first time winners included Western Samoa, Lesotho and Swaziland (since 2018 named Eswatini). The theme song for the 1974 British Commonwealth Games was called &quot;Join Together&quot;.

==== Commonwealth Games ====

The 1978 Commonwealth Games was held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. This event was the first to bear the current day name of the Commonwealth Games, and also marked a new high as almost 1,500 athletes from 46 countries took part. They were boycotted by Nigeria in protest against New Zealand&#x27;s sporting contacts with apartheid-era South Africa, as well as by Uganda in protest at alleged Canadian hostilities toward the government of Idi Amin.

The 1982 Commonwealth Games was held in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Forty-six nations participated in the Brisbane Games with a new record total of 1,583 athletes and 571 officials. As hosts, Australia headed the medal table leading the way ahead of England, Canada, Scotland and New Zealand respectively. Zimbabwe made its first appearance at the Games, having earlier competed as Southern Rhodesia and as part of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The theme song for the 1982 Commonwealth Games was called &quot;You&#x27;re Here To Win&quot;.

The 1986 Commonwealth Games was held in Edinburgh, Scotland and were the second Games to be held in Edinburgh. Participation at the 1986 Games was affected by a boycott by 32 African, Asian and Caribbean nations in protest at British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s refusal to condemn sporting contacts of apartheid era South Africa in 1985, but the Games rebounded and continued to grow thereafter. Twenty-six nations did attend the second Edinburgh Games, and sent a total of 1,662 athletes and 461 officials. The theme song for the 1986 Commonwealth Games was called &quot;Spirit Of Youth&quot;.

The 1990 Commonwealth Games was held in Auckland, New Zealand. It was the fourteenth Commonwealth Games, the third to be hosted by New Zealand and Auckland&#x27;s second. A new record of 55 nations participated in the second Auckland Games, sending 2,826 athletes and officials. Pakistan returned to the Commonwealth in 1989 after withdrawing in 1972, and competed in the 1990 Games after an absence of twenty years. The theme song for the 1990 Commonwealth Games was called &quot;This Is The Moment&quot;.

The 1994 Commonwealth Games was held in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. This event was the fourth to take place in Canada. The games marked another point of South Africa&#x27;s return to the sporting atmosphere following the apartheid era, and over thirty years since the country last competed in the Games in 1958. A former South African territory Namibia made its Commonwealth Games debut. It was also Hong Kong&#x27;s last appearance at the games before the transfer of sovereignty from Britain to China. Sixty-three nations sent 2,557 athletes and 914 officials. The theme song for the 1994 Commonwealth Games was called &quot;Let Your Spirit Take Flight&quot;.

The 1998 Commonwealth Games was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. For the first time in its 68-year history, the Commonwealth Games was held in Asia. The event was also the first Games to feature team sports (cricket,rugby 7&#x27;s,netball and field hockey) along ten pin bowling and squash– an overwhelming success that added large numbers to both participant and TV audience numbers. A new record of 70 countries sent a total of 5,065 athletes and officials to the Kuala Lumpur Games. The top five countries in the medal standing were Australia, England, Canada, Malaysia (who made their best games&#x27; performance until that date) and South Africa. Nauru also achieved an impressive haul of three gold medals. Cameroon, Mozambique, Kiribati and Tuvalu debuted. The theme song for the 1998 Commonwealth Games was called &quot;Forever As One&quot;.

==== During the 21st century ====

The 2002 Commonwealth Games was held in Manchester, England. The event was hosted in England for the first time since 1934 and hosted to coincide with the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, head of the Commonwealth. In terms of sports and events, the 2002 event was until the 2010 edition the largest Commonwealth Games in history featuring 281 events across 17 sports. The final medal tally was led by Australia, followed by host England and Canada. The 2002 Commonwealth Games had set a new benchmark for hosting the Commonwealth Games and for cities wishing to bid for them with a heavy emphasis on legacy. The theme song for the 2002 Commonwealth Games was called &quot;Where My Heart Will Take Me&quot;.

The 2006 Commonwealth Games was held in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The only difference between the 2006 games and the 2002 games was the absence of Zimbabwe, which withdrew from the Commonwealth of Nations. For the first time in the history of the Games the Queen&#x27;s Baton visited every single Commonwealth nation and territory taking part in the Games, a journey of . Over 4000 athletes took part in the sporting competitions. Again the Top 3 on the medal table is Australia, followed by England and Canada. The theme song for the 2006 Commonwealth Games was called &quot;Together We Are One&quot;.

The 2010 Commonwealth Games was held in Delhi, India. The Games cost $11 billion and is the most expensive Commonwealth Games ever. It was the first time that the Commonwealth Games was held in India, also the first time that a Commonwealth republic hosted the games and the second time it was held in Asia after Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1998. A total of 6,081 athletes from 71 Commonwealth nations and dependencies competed in 21 sports and 272 events. The final medal tally was led by Australia. The host nation India achieved its best performance ever in any sporting event, finishing second overall. Rwanda made its Games debut. The theme song for the 2010 Commonwealth Games was called &quot;Live, Rise, Ascend, Win&quot;.

The 2014 Commonwealth Games was held in Glasgow, Scotland. It was the largest multi-sport event ever held in Scotland with around 4,950 athletes from 71 different nations and territories competing in 18 different sports, outranking the 1970 and 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, capital city of Scotland. Usain Bolt competed in the 4×100 metres relay of the 2014 Commonwealth Games and set a Commonwealth Games record with his teammates. The Games received acclaim for their organisation, attendance, and the public enthusiasm of the people of Scotland, with the CGF chief executive Mike Hooper hailing them as &quot;the standout games in the history of the movement&quot;.

The 2018 Commonwealth Games was held in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, the fifth time Australia hosted the Games. There were an equal number of events for men and women, the first time in history that a major multi-sport event had equality in terms of events.

The 2022 Commonwealth Games was held in Birmingham, England. It was the third Commonwealth Games to be hosted in England, following London 1934 and Manchester 2002. The 2022 Commonwealth Games coincided with the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II and the tenth anniversary of the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Paralympics, both staged in London. The 2022 Commonwealth Games was the last edition to be held under Queen Elizabeth II, before her death on 8 September 2022.

On 16 February 2022, it was announced that the 2026 Commonwealth Games would be held for a record sixth time in Australia, but for the first time they would be decentralised, as the state of Victoria signed as host &#x27;city&#x27;. The event were to have four regional clusters mainly focused in Bendigo region, and another three regional centres. The 2026 Commonwealth Games were to be the first games to be held under the reign of King Charles III. It was also confirmed that the Commonwealth Games, scheduled for 2030 were likely to be awarded to Hamilton, Canada. However, in July 2023, the Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced that Victoria would no longer host the 2026 Games, with Alberta, pulling out of their part in a joint Canadian bid for the 2030 edition of the Games shortly after. The Scottish government agreed to hold the 2026 games in Glasgow, following Victoria&#x27;s cancellation, however the games will be &quot;scaled down&quot; with only 10 sports being staged in four venues, and a commitment that public funds would not be required.

Many commentators are now questioning the continuing viability of the Commonwealth Games. The three nations to have hosted the Commonwealth Games the most times are Australia (5), Canada (4) and New Zealand (3). With the 2022 games, England increased its number to three. Seven Games have taken place in the countries within the United Kingdom (Scotland (3) and Wales (1)), two in Asia (Malaysia (1) and India (1)) and one in the Caribbean (Jamaica (1)). The event has been awarded to, but never been held in, Africa, with Durban being stripped of the 2022 Games following financial issues.

On 17 September 2024 since Australia withdrew, Glasgow was confirmed as the replacement city for the 2026 Commonwealth Games.

=== Paraplegic Games ===


The Commonwealth Paraplegic Games were an international, multi-sport event involving athletes with a disability from the Commonwealth countries. The event was sometimes referred to as the Paraplegic Empire Games and British Commonwealth Paraplegic Games. Athletes were generally those with spinal injuries or polio. The event was first held in 1962 and disestablished in 1974. The Games were held in the country hosting the Commonwealth Games for able-bodied athletes. The countries that had hosted the Commonwealth Paraplegic Games were Australia, Jamaica, Scotland and New Zealand in 1962, 1966, 1970 and 1974. Six countries – Australia, England, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales — had been represented at all Commonwealth Paraplegic Games. Australia and England had been the top-ranking nation two times each: 1962, 1974 and 1966, 1970.

==== Inclusion of disabled athletes in Commonwealth Games ====

Athletes with a disability were then first included the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia when this events was added to athletics and lawn bowls, As at 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England, they were included as compulsory events, making them the first fully inclusive international multi-sport games. This meant that results were included in the medal count and the athletes are full members of each country delegation.

During the 2007 General Assembly of the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) at Colombo, Sri Lanka, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and CGF signed a co-operative agreement to ensure a formal institutional relationship between the two bodies and secure the future participation of elite athletes with a disability (EAD) in future Commonwealth Games.

Then, IPC President Philip Craven said during the General Assembly:
The co-operation agreement outlined the strong partnership between the IPC and the CGF. It recognised the IPC as the respective sport body and have the function to oversee the co-ordination and delivery of the Commonwealth Games EAD sports programme and committed both organisations to work together in supporting the growth of the Paralympic and Commonwealth Games Movements.

=== Winter Games ===


The Commonwealth Winter Games was a multi-sport event comprising winter sports, last held in 1966. Three editions of the Games have been staged. The Commonwealth Winter Games were designed as a counterbalance to the Commonwealth Games, which focuses on summer sports, to accompany the Winter Olympics and Summer Olympic Games. The winter Games were founded by T.D. Richardson. The 1958 Commonwealth Winter Games were held in St. Moritz, Switzerland and was the inaugural games for the winter edition. The 1962 Games were also held in St. Moritz, complementing the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Australia, and the 1966 event was held in St. Moritz as well, following which the idea was discontinued.

=== Youth Games ===
The Commonwealth Youth Games is an international multi-sport event organised by the Commonwealth Games Federation. The Commonwealth Youth Games is held every four years with the current Commonwealth Games format. The Commonwealth Games Federation discussed the idea of a Millennium Commonwealth Youth Games in 1997. In 1998, the concept was agreed on for the purpose of providing a Commonwealth multi-sport event for young people born in 1986 or later. The first version was held in Edinburgh, Scotland from 10 to 14 August 2000. The age limitation of the athletes is 14 to 18.

The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) is the international organisation responsible for the direction and control of the Commonwealth Games and Commonwealth Youth Games, and is the foremost authority in matters relating to the games. The Commonwealth House in London, England hosts the headquarters of CGF. The Commonwealth House also hosts the headquarters of the Royal Commonwealth Society and the Commonwealth Local Government Forum.

The Commonwealth Games Movement is made of three major elements:

* International Federations (IFs) are the governing bodies that supervise a sport at an international level. For example, the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) is the international governing body for basketball.
* Commonwealth Games Associations (CGAs) represent and regulate the Commonwealth Games Movement within each country and perform similar functions as the National Olympic Committees. For example, the Commonwealth Games England (CGE) is the CGA of England. There are currently 72 CGAs recognised by the CGF.
* Organising Committees for the Commonwealth Games (OCCWGs) are temporary committees responsible for the organisation of each Commonwealth Games. OCCWGs are dissolved after each Games once the final report is delivered to the CGF.

English is the official language of the Commonwealth. The other language used at each Commonwealth Games is the language of the host country (or languages, if a country has more than one official language apart from English). Every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony) is spoken in these two (or more) languages. If the host country does this, it is their responsibility to choose the language{s) and their order.

== Queen&#x27;s Baton Relay ==


The Queen&#x27;s Baton Relay is a relay around the world held prior to the beginning of the Commonwealth Games. The Baton carries a message from the Head of the Commonwealth. The Relay traditionally begins at Buckingham Palace in London as a part of the city&#x27;s Commonwealth Day festivities. The Queen entrusts the baton to the first relay runner. At the Opening Ceremony of the Games, the final relay runner hands the baton back to the Queen or her representative, who reads the message aloud to officially open the Games. The Queen&#x27;s Baton Relay is similar to the Olympic Torch Relay.

The Relay was introduced at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, Wales as the Queen&#x27;s Baton Relay. Up until, and including, the 1994 Commonwealth Games, the Relay only went through England and the host nation. The Relay for the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia was the first to travel to other nations of the Commonwealth.

The Queen&#x27;s Baton Relay for the 2018 Commonwealth Games held on the Gold Coast, Australia, was the longest in Commonwealth Games history. Covering 230,000 km (150,000 miles) over 388 days, the Baton made its way through the six Commonwealth regions of Africa, the Americas, the Caribbean, Europe, Asia and Oceania. For the first time, the Queen&#x27;s Baton was presented at the Commonwealth Youth Games during its sixth edition in 2017, which were held in Nassau, Bahamas.

== Ceremonies ==

=== Opening ===

Various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games. This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred. The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country&#x27;s flag and a performance of its national anthem. The flag of the Commonwealth Games Federation, flag of the last hosting nation and the next hosting nation are also hosted during the opening ceremony. The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance and theatre representative of its culture. The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor&#x27;s in terms of memorability. The opening ceremony of the Delhi Games reportedly cost $70 million, with much of the cost incurred in the artistic segment.

After the artistic portion of the ceremony, the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation. The last hosting nation is traditionally the first nation to enter. Nations then enter the stadium alphabetical or continental wise with the host country&#x27;s athletes being the last to enter. Speeches are given, formally opening the Games. Finally, the King&#x27;s Baton is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final baton carrier, often a successful Commonwealth athlete from the host nation, who hands it over to the Head of the Commonwealth or his representative.

=== Closing ===

The closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter the stadium, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction. The president of the organising committee and the CGF president make their closing speeches and the Games are officially closed. The CGF president also speaks about the conduct of the games. The mayor of the city that organised the Games transfers the CGF flag to the president of the CGF, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Commonwealth Games. The next host nation then also briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theatre representative of its culture. Many great artists and singers had performed at the ceremonies of the Commonwealth Games.

At the closing ceremony of every Commonwealth Games, the CGF President makes an award and presents a trophy to one athlete who has competed with particular distinction and honour both in terms of athletic performance and overall contribution to his or her team. Athletes are nominated by their Commonwealth Games Association at the end of the final day of competition and the winner is selected by a panel comprising the CGF President and representatives from each of the six Commonwealth Regions. The &#x27;David Dixon Award&#x27; as it is called was introduced in Manchester 2002, after the late David Dixon, former Honorary Secretary of the CGF, in honour of his monumental contribution to Commonwealth sport for many years.

=== Medal presentation ===

A medal ceremony is held after each event is concluded. The winner, second and third-place competitors or teams stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum to be awarded their respective medals. After the medals are given out by a CGF member, the national flags of the three medallists are raised while the national anthem of the gold medallist&#x27;s country plays. Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag-bearers.

=== Anthems ===
&quot;God Save the King&quot; is an official or national anthem of multiple Commonwealth countries and dependent territories. As a result, and due to the countries of the United Kingdom competing individually, its use is prohibited during official events, medal ceremonies or before matches in team events.
With the revision of this rule made before the 2010 Games, some national anthems used were changed and in some cases they differ from a currently-eligible country&#x27;s national or official anthem(s):

== Commonwealth sports ==
Unlike other sporting events, the Commonwealth Games have a flexible sporting programme that respects the infrastructure and demands of the host city. This is also reflected in its holding dates, which may vary according to the weather conditions of each host city. Therefore, the programme for each edition varies. Between 1930 and 1994, only individual events were part of the programme and it was only in 1998 that authorisation was given for the addition of team sports. It is common for each edition since then to have a list of seven to ten mandatory sports that must be played in this edition and must be approved 4 years in advance. Thus, the minimum number of sports per edition is 10 and the maximum is of 17. However, local demands can also increase the number of sports contested. Notable cases are freestyle wrestling in Delhi 2010 and beach volleyball in Gold Coast 2018. Special exceptions can also be made, such as the one in the last edition held in Birmingham, England, in which 3 extra sports were added to the programme. The current rules also determine gender parity, whereby men and women have an equal (or broadly equal) share of events.

There are a total of 23 sports (with three multi-disciplinary sports) and a ten para-sports which are approved by the Commonwealth Games Federation.

In 2015, the Commonwealth Games Federation agreed large changes to the programme which increased the number of core sports, while removing a number of optionals, those removed are listed below.

Sports such as the following are sports which have been analysed by the Commonwealth Games Federation but which are deemed to need expansion in areas such as participation levels within the Commonwealth both at a national (International Federation) and grassroots athletics level, Marketability, Television Rights, Equity, and Hosting Expenses, per Regulation 6 of the Commonwealth Games Constitution; host nations may not pick these sports for their program until the Federation&#x27;s requirements are fulfilled.

== Participation ==
Only six teams have attended every Commonwealth Games: Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, Scotland, and Wales. Australia has been the highest scoring team for thirteen games, England for seven, and Canada for one.

=== Commonwealth nations yet to send teams ===
Very few Commonwealth nations and dependencies have yet to take part:
* Gabon and Togo, the most recent members to join the Commonwealth in 2022, became part of the Commonwealth Games Federation in 2023 and are expected to make their debut in the 2026 edition.
* Tokelau, a dependency of New Zealand, was expected to take part for the first time at the 2010 Games in Delhi but did not do so. In 2018, Tokelau was noted to be ineligible for the Commonwealth Games until it became affiliated to at least five international sport federations.
* Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, both external territories of Australia like Norfolk Island, have not yet sent teams of their own.
* The Pitcairn Islands, a British Overseas Territory, does not compete due to its small population (around 50 people).

Other inhabited territories and autonomous regions within the Commonwealth, such as Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha (parts of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha), Nevis (a federal entity of the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis), Rodrigues (an outer island of Mauritius), and Zanzibar (a semi-autonomous part of Tanzania), are not considered to be separate associated or overseas territories by the Commonwealth and so are unlikely to be eligible.

=== Rejected participants ===
Campaigners from the English county of Cornwall asked the Commonwealth Games Federation to allow Cornwall to participate independently in the 2006 Games, but were rejected by the CGF, which stated that &quot;Cornwall is no more than an English county&quot; and advised Cornwall athletes to compete on the England team. Cornwall political party Mebyon Kernow unsuccessfully called for a Cornwall team at the 2022 Games.

The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus applied to take part in the 2006 Games, but was rejected due to a lack of international recognition.

== Controversies ==

=== Host city contract ===

The 1934 British Empire Games, originally awarded in 1930 to Johannesburg, were moved to London after South Africa&#x27;s pre-apartheid government refused to allow participants of colour.

The 2022 Commonwealth Games were originally awarded to Durban on 2 September 2015, at the CGF General Assembly in Auckland. It was reported in February 2017 that Durban may be unable to host the games due to financial constraints. On 13 March 2017, the CGF stripped Durban of their rights to host and reopened the bidding process for the 2022 games. Many cities from Australia, Canada, England and Malaysia expressed interest to host the games. However, the CGF received only one official bid and that was from Birmingham, England. On 21 December 2017, Birmingham was awarded for the 2022 Games as Durban&#x27;s replacement host.

The state of Victoria, Australia was selected to host the 2026 Commonwealth Games. On 18 July 2023, the Premier of Victoria Dan Andrews announced the cancellation of the event in Victoria. Premier Andrews cited a significant increase in forecast cost for the reason suggesting the initial estimate of A$2.6 billion was likely to be closer to A$6–7 billion. On 18 July 2023, the Victorian state government announced it had cancelled its plans to host the games, citing an escalation in its cost projections relative to initial estimations. With no host city, there was a possibility that the games would be postponed to 2027 or cancelled. However, on 17 September 2024, it was announced that the Scottish Government had agreed to host the 2026 games in Glasgow.

=== Boycotts ===

Much like the Olympic Games, the Commonwealth Games have also experienced boycotts:

Nigeria boycotted the 1978 Commonwealth Games at Edmonton in protest of New Zealand&#x27;s sporting contacts with apartheid-era South Africa. Uganda also stayed away, in protest of alleged Canadian hostility towards the government of Idi Amin.

During the 1986 Commonwealth Games at Edinburgh, a majority of the Commonwealth nations staged a boycott, so that the Games appeared to be a whites-only event. Thirty two of the eligible fifty nine countries—largely African, Asian and Caribbean states—stayed away because of the Thatcher government&#x27;s policy of keeping Britain&#x27;s sporting links with apartheid South Africa in preference to participating in the general sporting boycott of that country. Consequently, Edinburgh 1986 witnessed the lowest number of athletes since Auckland 1950. The boycotting nations were Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Bermuda, Belize, Cyprus, Dominica, Gambia, Ghana, Guyana, Grenada, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Sierra Leone, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, Mauritius, Trinidad and Tobago, Tanzania, Turks and Caicos Islands, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Bermuda was a particularly late withdrawal, as its athletes appeared in the opening ceremony and in the opening day of competition before the Bermuda Olympic Association decided to formally withdraw.

===Protests===

The 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane took place amid mass protests for Australian Aboriginal rights. The controversial Joh Bjelke-Petersen state government had been repeatedly been challenged by the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties over the restrictions it placed on freedom of speech, freedom of association and freedom to protest. The Government of Queensland did not recognise Aboriginal land rights. Queensland also placed severe legal restrictions on Aboriginal people through the &quot;Aboriginal Act 1971&quot;.

Aboriginal activists including Gary Foley planned mass demonstrations in Brisbane during the week of the games, dubbed the &quot;Stolenwealth Games&quot;. In response, Queensland passed &quot;The Commonwealth Games Act 1982&quot; to restrict protests in or near the event. When Aboriginal activists and their supporters marched anyway, hundreds were arrested. The protests were recorded in the documentary &quot;Guniwaya Ngigu&quot;.

Further &quot;Stolenwealth Games&quot; protests took place during the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne and 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast.

== Financial implications ==
The estimated cost of the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi was US$11 billion, according to &quot;Business Today&quot; magazine. The initial total budget estimated by the Indian Olympic Association in 2003 was US$250 million. In 2010, however, the official total budget soon escalated to an estimated US$1.8 billion, a figure which excluded non-sports-related infrastructure development. The 2010 Commonwealth Games is reportedly the most expensive Commonwealth Games ever.

An analysis conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers on the 2002, 2006, 2014 and 2018 Commonwealth Games found that each dollar spent by governments on operating costs, games venues and athletes&#x27; villages generated US$2 for the host city or state economies, with an average of more than 18,000 jobs generated by each of the events. Additionally, all four cities enjoyed long-term improvements to transport or other infrastructure through hosting the Games, while some also benefited from the revival of struggling precincts.

An analysis conducted by Ernst &amp; Young found that the 2018 Commonwealth Games generated an estimated economic impact of $2.5 billion, while the venues constructed and upgraded for the Games generated over $60 million in economic benefit annually to the Gold Coast, with the success of the 2018 Commonwealth Games credited with helping Brisbane to secure hosting rights for the 2032 Summer Olympics.

== Notable competitors ==

Lawn bowler Willie Wood from Scotland was the first competitor to have competed in seven Commonwealth Games, from 1974 to 2002, a record equalled in 2014 by Isle of Man cyclist Andrew Roche. They have both been surpassed by David Calvert of Northern Ireland who in 2018 attended his 11th games.

Sitiveni Rabuka was a Prime Minister of Fiji. Beforehand he represented Fiji in shot put, hammer throw, discus and the decathlon at the 1974 British Commonwealth Games held in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Lawn bowler Robert Weale has represented Wales in 8 Commonwealth Games, 1986–2014, winning 2 gold, 3 silver and 1 bronze.

Nauruan weightlifter Marcus Stephen won twelve medals at the Games between 1990 and 2002, of which seven gold, and was elected President of Nauru in 2007. His performance has helped place Nauru (the smallest independent state in the Commonwealth, at and with a population of fewer than 9,400 in 2011) in twenty-second place on the all-time Commonwealth Games medal table.

Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe has won 10 Commonwealth Games gold medals and 1 silver medal. At the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, he won 4 gold medals. At the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, he won 6 gold medals and 1 silver medal.

Chad le Clos, South Africa&#x27;s most decorated swimmer, has won 18 medals from four Commonwealth Games (2010, 2014, 2018 &amp; 2022), seven of which are gold. At the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, he won two gold medals, one silver medal, and four bronze medals. At the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, he won three golds, a silver and a bronze.

English actor Jason Statham took part as a diver in the 1990 Commonwealth Games.

At the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, Australian singer Cody Simpson won a gold medal as a swimmer at the men&#x27;s 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay.

<doc id="39183" wikidata="Q687074" url="?curid=39183" title="ReiserFS">
<text>ReiserFS is a general-purpose, journaling file system initially designed and implemented by a team at Namesys led by Hans Reiser and licensed under GPLv2. Introduced in version 2.4.1 of the Linux kernel, it was the first journaling file system to be included in the standard kernel. ReiserFS was the default file system in Novell&#x27;s SUSE Linux Enterprise until Novell decided to move to ext3 for future releases on October 12, 2006.

ReiserFS version 3.6, now occasionally referred to as Reiser3, introduced a new on-disk format allowing larger filesizes. Namesys considered ReiserFS stable and feature-complete and ceased development on it to concentrate on its successor, Reiser4, though it continued to release security updates and critical bug fixes. Namesys went out of business in 2008 after Reiser&#x27;s conviction for murder. The product is now maintained as open source by volunteers. The reiserfsprogs 3.6.27 were released on 25 July 2017.

As of Linux 6.12, ReiserFS is supported on Linux without quota support. Due to technical issues inherent to the file system and lack of maintenance, Linux community had been discussing removal of ReiserFS from mainline since at least early 2022. ReiserFS was removed from the Linux kernel in version 6.13.

==Features==
At the time of its introduction, ReiserFS offered features that had not been available in existing Linux file systems. These include tail packing—a scheme to reduce internal fragmentation at cost of performance. Reiser4 may have improved this by packing tails where it does not negatively affect performance.

==Design==
ReiserFS stores file metadata (&quot;stat items&quot;), directory entries (&quot;directory items&quot;), inode block lists (&quot;indirect items&quot;), and tails of files (&quot;direct items&quot;) in a single, combined B+ tree keyed by a universal object ID. Disk blocks allocated to nodes of the tree are &quot;formatted internal blocks&quot;. Blocks for leaf nodes (in which items are packed end-to-end) are &quot;formatted leaf blocks&quot;. All other blocks are &quot;unformatted blocks&quot; containing file contents. Directory items with too many entries or indirect items which are too long to fit into a node spill over into the right leaf neighbour. Block allocation is tracked by free space bitmaps in fixed locations.

By contrast, ext2 and other Berkeley FFS-like file systems of that time simply used a fixed formula for computing inode locations, hence limiting the number of files they may contain. Most such file systems also store directories as simple lists of entries, which makes directory lookups and updates linear time operations and degrades performance on very large directories. The single B+ tree design in ReiserFS avoids both of these problems due to better scalability properties.

==Performance==
Compared with ext2 and ext3 in version 2.4 of the Linux kernel, when dealing with files under 4 KiB and with tail packing enabled, ReiserFS may be faster.

Before Linux 2.6.33, ReiserFS heavily used the big kernel lock (BKL)—a global kernel-wide lock—which does not scale well for systems with multiple cores, as the critical code parts are only ever executed by one core at a time.

== Usage ==
ReiserFS was the default file system in SUSE Linux since version 6.4 (released in 2000), until switching to ext3 in SUSE Linux Enterprise 10.2 and openSUSE 11, announced in 2006.

Jeff Mahoney of SUSE wrote a post on 14 September 2006 proposing to move from ReiserFS to ext3 for the default installation file system. The reasons he mentioned included scalability, &quot;performance problems with extended attributes and ACLs&quot;, &quot;a small and shrinking development community&quot;, and that &quot;Reiser4 is not an incremental update and requires a reformat, which is unreasonable for most people.&quot; On October 4 he wrote a response comment on a blog in order to clear up some issues. He wrote that his proposal for the switch was unrelated to Hans Reiser being under trial for murder. Mahoney wrote he &quot;was concerned that people would make a connection where none existed&quot; and that &quot;the timing is entirely coincidental and the motivation is unrelated.&quot;

ReiserFS has been discussed for removal from the Linux kernel since early 2022 due to a lack of maintenance upstream, and technical issues inherent to the filesystem, such as suffering from the year 2038 problem; it was deprecated in Linux 5.18, and marked as obsolete in Linux 6.6, with complete removal planned for Linux 6.13. ReiserFS was removed from mainline during Linux 6.13 development cycle.

==Criticism==
Some directory operations (including (2)) are not synchronous on ReiserFS, which can result in data corruption with applications relying heavily on file-based locks (such as mail transfer agents like qmail and Postfix) if the machine halts before it has synchronized the disk.

There are no programs to specifically defragment a ReiserFS file system, although tools have been written to automatically copy the contents of fragmented files hoping that more contiguous blocks of free space can be found. However, a &quot;repacker&quot; tool was planned for the next Reiser4 file system to deal with file fragmentation. Fragmentation is still an issue with SSD regardless of file system.

===fsck===
ReiserFS 3&#x27;s fsck is capable of rebuilding the whole tree as part of the rescue in case of its total corruption. This action has to be explicitly initiated by administrator and is not part of normal operation. Predictably, the process is destructive and may further corrupt existing files or introduce new entries with unexpected contents, which has been criticized as a less than optimal method.

ReiserFS v3 images should not be stored on a ReiserFS v3 partition (e.g. backups or disk images for emulators) without transforming them (e.g., by compressing or encrypting) in order to avoid confusing the rebuild. Reformatting an existing ReiserFS v3 partition can also leave behind data that could confuse the rebuild operation and make files from the old system reappear. This also allows malicious users to intentionally store files that will confuse the rebuilder. As the metadata is always in a consistent state after a file system check, &quot;corruption&quot; here means that contents of files are merged in unexpected ways with the contained file system&#x27;s metadata. This is similar to the FSID problem in btrfs. The ReiserFS successor, Reiser4, fixes this problem.

ReiserFS in versions of the Linux kernel before 2.4.16 were considered unstable by Namesys and not recommended for production use, especially in conjunction with NFS.

Early implementations of ReiserFS (prior to that in Linux 2.6.2) were also susceptible to out-of-order write hazards. But the current journaling implementation in ReiserFS is now on par with that of ext3&#x27;s &quot;ordered&quot; journaling level.

<text>NT File System (NTFS) (commonly called &quot;New Technology File System&quot;) is a proprietary journaling file system developed by Microsoft in the 1990s.

It was developed to overcome scalability, security and other limitations with FAT. NTFS adds several features that FAT and HPFS lack, including: access control lists (ACLs); filesystem encryption; transparent compression; sparse files; file system journaling and volume shadow copy, a feature that allows backups of a system while in use.

Starting with Windows NT 3.1, it is the default file system of the Windows NT family superseding the File Allocation Table (FAT) file system. NTFS read/write support is available on Linux and BSD using NTFS3 in Linux and NTFS-3G in BSD. 

NTFS uses several files hidden from the user to store metadata about other files stored on the drive which can help improve speed and performance when reading data.

== History ==
In the mid-1980s, Microsoft and IBM formed a joint project to create the next generation of graphical operating system; the result was OS/2 and HPFS. Because Microsoft disagreed with IBM on many important issues, they eventually separated; OS/2 remained an IBM project and Microsoft worked to develop Windows NT and NTFS.

The HPFS file system for OS/2 contained several important new features. When Microsoft created their new operating system, they borrowed many of these concepts for NTFS. The original NTFS developers were Tom Miller, Gary Kimura, Brian Andrew, and David Goebel.

Probably as a result of this common ancestry, HPFS and NTFS use the same disk partition identification type code (07). Using the same Partition ID Record Number is highly unusual, since there were dozens of unused code numbers available, and other major file systems have their own codes. For example, FAT has more than nine (one each for FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, etc.). Algorithms identifying the file system in a partition type 07 must perform additional checks to distinguish between HPFS and NTFS.

=== Versions ===
Microsoft has released five versions of NTFS:
The version number (e.g. v5.0 in Windows 2000) is based on the operating system version; it should not be confused with the NTFS version number (v3.1 since Windows XP).

Although subsequent versions of Windows added new file system-related features, they did not change NTFS itself. For example, Windows Vista implemented NTFS symbolic links, Transactional NTFS, partition shrinking, and self-healing. NTFS symbolic links are a new feature in the file system; all the others are new operating system features that make use of NTFS features already in place.

== Scalability ==
NTFS is optimized for 4 KB clusters, but supports a maximum cluster size of 2MB. (Earlier implementations support up to 64KB) The maximum NTFS volume size that the specification can support is clusters, but not all implementations achieve this theoretical maximum, as discussed below.

The maximum NTFS volume size implemented in Windows XP Professional is clusters, partly due to partition table limitations. For example, using 64KB clusters, the maximum size Windows XP NTFS volume is 256TB minus 64KB. Using the default cluster size of 4KB, the maximum NTFS volume size is 16TB minus 4KB. Both of these are vastly higher than the 128GB limit in Windows XP SP1. The size of a partition in the Master Boot Record (MBR) is limited to 2 TiB with a hard drive with 512-byte physical sectors, although for a 4 KiB physical sector the MBR partition size limit is 16 TiB. An alternative is to use multiple GUID Partition Table (GPT or &quot;dynamic&quot;) volumes for be combined to create a single NTFS volume larger than 2 TiB. Booting from a GPT volume to a Windows environment in a Microsoft supported way requires a system with Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) and 64-bit support. GPT data disks are supported on systems with BIOS.

The NTFS maximum theoretical limit on the size of individual files is 16EB ( or ) minus 1KB, which totals 18,446,744,073,709,550,592 bytes. With Windows 10 version 1709 and Windows Server 2019, the maximum &quot;implemented&quot; file size is 8PB minus 2MB or 9,007,199,252,643,840 bytes.

== Interoperability ==

=== Windows ===
While the different NTFS versions are for the most part fully forward- and backward-compatible, there are technical considerations for mounting newer NTFS volumes in older versions of Microsoft Windows. This affects dual-booting, and external portable hard drives. For example, attempting to use an NTFS partition with &quot;Previous Versions&quot; (Volume Shadow Copy) on an operating system that does not support it will result in the contents of those previous versions being lost. A Windows command-line utility called convert.exe can convert supporting file systems to NTFS, including HPFS (only on Windows NT 3.1, 3.5, and 3.51), FAT16 and FAT32 (on Windows 2000 and later).

=== FreeBSD ===
FreeBSD 3.2 released in May 1999 included read-only NTFS support written by Semen Ustimenko. This implementation was ported to NetBSD by Christos Zoulas and Jaromir Dolecek and released with NetBSD 1.5 in December 2000. The FreeBSD implementation of NTFS was also ported to OpenBSD by Julien Bordet and offers native read-only NTFS support by default on i386 and amd64 platforms 

=== Linux ===
Linux kernel versions 2.1.74 and later include a driver written by Martin von Löwis which has the ability to read NTFS partitions; kernel versions 2.5.11 and later contain a new driver written by Anton Altaparmakov (University of Cambridge) and Richard Russon which supports file read. The ability to write to files was introduced with kernel version 2.6.15 in 2006 which allows users to write to existing files but does not allow the creation of new ones. Paragon&#x27;s NTFS driver (see below) has been merged into kernel version 5.15, and it supports read/write on normal, compressed and sparse files, as well as journal replaying.

NTFS-3G is a free GPL-licensed FUSE implementation of NTFS that was initially developed as a Linux kernel driver by Szabolcs Szakacsits. It was re-written as a FUSE program to work on other systems that FUSE supports like macOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, QNX, and Haiku and allows reading and writing to NTFS partitions. A performance enhanced commercial version of NTFS-3G, called &quot;Tuxera NTFS for Mac&quot;, is also available from the NTFS-3G developers.

Captive NTFS, a &#x27;wrapping&#x27; driver that uses Windows&#x27; own driver , exists for Linux. It was built as a Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) program and released under the GPL but work on Captive NTFS ceased in 2006.

Linux kernel versions 5.15 onwards carry NTFS3, a fully functional NTFS Read-Write driver which works on NTFS versions up to 3.1 and is maintained primarily by the Paragon Software Group.

=== macOS ===
Mac OS X 10.3 included Ustimenko&#x27;s read-only implementation of NTFS from FreeBSD. Then in 2006 Apple hired Anton Altaparmakov to write a new NTFS implementation for Mac OS X 10.6. Native NTFS write support is included in 10.6 and later, but is not activated by default, although workarounds do exist to enable the functionality. However, user reports indicate the functionality is unstable and tends to cause kernel panics.

Paragon Software Group sells a read-write driver named &quot;NTFS for Mac&quot;, which is also included on some models of Seagate hard drives. 

=== OS/2 ===
The NetDrive package for OS/2 (and derivatives such as eComStation and ArcaOS) supports a plugin which allows read and write access to NTFS volumes.

=== DOS ===
There is a free-for-personal-use read/write driver for MS-DOS by Avira called &quot;NTFS4DOS&quot;.

Ahead Software developed a &quot;NTFSREAD&quot; driver (version 1.200) for DR-DOS 7.0x between 2002 and 2004. It was part of their Nero Burning ROM software.

== Security ==
NTFS uses access control lists and user-level encryption to help secure user data.

=== Access control lists (ACLs) ===

In NTFS, each file or folder is assigned a security descriptor that defines its owner and contains two access control lists (ACLs). The first ACL, called discretionary access control list (DACL), defines exactly what type of interactions (e.g. reading, writing, executing or deleting) are allowed or forbidden by which user or groups of users. For example, files in the folder may be read and executed by all users but modified only by a user holding administrative privileges. Windows Vista adds mandatory access control info to DACLs. DACLs are the primary focus of User Account Control in Windows Vista and later.

The second ACL, called system access control list (SACL), defines which interactions with the file or folder are to be audited and whether they should be logged when the activity is successful, failed or both. For example, auditing can be enabled on sensitive files of a company, so that its managers get to know when someone tries to delete them or make a copy of them, and whether they succeed.

=== Encryption ===
Encrypting File System (EFS) provides user-transparent encryption of any file or folder on an NTFS volume. EFS works in conjunction with the EFS service, Microsoft&#x27;s CryptoAPI and the EFS File System Run-Time Library (FSRTL). EFS works by encrypting a file with a bulk symmetric key (also known as the File Encryption Key, or FEK), which is used because it takes a relatively small amount of time to encrypt and decrypt large amounts of data than if an asymmetric key cipher is used. The symmetric key that is used to encrypt the file is then encrypted with a public key that is associated with the user who encrypted the file, and this encrypted data is stored in an alternate data stream of the encrypted file. To decrypt the file, the file system uses the private key of the user to decrypt the symmetric key that is stored in the data stream. It then uses the symmetric key to decrypt the file. Because this is done at the file system level, it is transparent to the user. Also, in case of a user losing access to their key, support for additional decryption keys has been built into the EFS system, so that a recovery agent can still access the files if needed. NTFS-provided encryption and NTFS-provided compression are mutually exclusive; however, NTFS can be used for one and a third-party tool for the other.

The support of EFS is not available in Basic, Home, and MediaCenter versions of Windows, and must be activated after installation of Professional, Ultimate, and Server versions of Windows or by using enterprise deployment tools within Windows domains.

== Features ==

=== Journaling ===
NTFS is a journaling file system and uses the NTFS Log () to record metadata changes to the volume. It is a feature that FAT does not provide and is critical for NTFS to ensure that its complex internal data structures will remain consistent in case of system crashes or data moves performed by the defragmentation API, and allow easy rollback of uncommitted changes to these critical data structures when the volume is remounted. Notably affected structures are the volume allocation bitmap, modifications to MFT records such as moves of some variable-length attributes stored in MFT records and attribute lists, and indices for directories and security descriptors.

The () format has evolved through several versions:

The incompatibility of the versions implemented by Windows 8, Windows 10, Windows 11 prevents Windows 7 (and earlier versions of Windows) from recognizing version 2.0 of the . Backward compatibility is provided by downgrading the to version 1.1 when an NTFS volume is cleanly dismounted. It is again upgraded to version 2.0 when mounting on a compatible version of Windows. However, when hibernating to disk in the logoff state (a.k.a. Hybrid Boot or Fast Boot, which is enabled by default), mounted file systems are not dismounted, and thus the s of any active file systems are not downgraded to version 1.1. The inability to process version 2.0 of the by versions of Windows older than 8.0 results in an unnecessary invocation of the CHKDSK disk repair utility. This is particularly a concern in a multi-boot scenario involving pre- and post-8.0 versions of Windows, or when frequently moving a storage device between older and newer versions. A Windows Registry setting exists to prevent the automatic upgrade of the to the newer version. The problem can also be dealt with by disabling Hybrid Boot.

The USN Journal (Update Sequence Number Journal) is a system management feature that records (in ) changes to files, streams and directories on the volume, as well as their various attributes and security settings. The journal is made available for applications to track changes to the volume. This journal can be enabled or disabled on non-system volumes.

=== Hard links ===
The hard link feature allows different file names to directly refer to the same file contents. Hard links may link only to files in the same volume, because each volume has its own MFT.
Hard links were originally included to support the POSIX subsystem in Windows NT.

Although hard links use the same MFT record (inode) which records file metadata such as file size, modification date, and attributes, NTFS also caches this data in the directory entry as a performance enhancement. This means that when listing the contents of a directory using FindFirstFile/FindNextFile family of APIs, (equivalent to the POSIX opendir/readdir APIs) you will also receive this cached information, in addition to the name and inode. However, you may not see up-to-date information, as this information is only guaranteed to be updated when a file is closed, and then only for the directory from which the file was opened. This means where a file has multiple names via hard links, updating a file via one name does not update the cached data associated with the other name. You can always obtain up-to-date data using GetFileInformationByHandle (which is the true equivalent of POSIX stat function). This can be done using a handle which has no access to the file itself (passing zero to CreateFile for dwDesiredAccess), and closing this handle has the incidental effect of updating the cached information.

Windows uses hard links to support short (8.3) filenames in NTFS. Operating system support is needed because there are legacy applications that can work only with 8.3 filenames, but support can be disabled. In this case, an additional filename record and directory entry is added, but both 8.3 and long file name are linked and updated together, unlike a regular hard link.

The NTFS file system has a limit of 1023 hard links on a file.

=== Alternate data stream (ADS) ===
Alternate data streams allow more than one data stream to be associated with a filename (a fork), using the format &quot;filename:streamname&quot; (e.g., &quot;text.txt:extrastream&quot;). These streams are not shown to or made editable by users through any typical GUI application built into Windows by default, disguising their existence from most users. Although intended for helpful metadata, their arcane nature makes them a potential hiding place for malware, spyware, unseen browser history, and other potentially unwanted information.

Alternate streams are not listed in Windows Explorer, and their size is not included in the file&#x27;s size. When the file is copied or moved to another file system without ADS support the user is warned that alternate data streams cannot be preserved. No such warning is typically provided if the file is attached to an e-mail, or uploaded to a website. Thus, using alternate streams for critical data may cause problems. Microsoft provides a downloadable tool called Streams to view streams on a selected volume. Starting with Windows PowerShell 3.0, it is possible to manage ADS natively with six cmdlets: Add-Content, Clear-Content, Get-Content, Get-Item, Remove-Item, Set-Content.

A small ADS named codice_1 is added by Internet Explorer and by most browsers to mark files downloaded from external sites as possibly unsafe to run; the local shell would then require user confirmation before opening them. When the user indicates that they no longer want this confirmation dialog, this ADS is deleted. This functionality is also known as &quot;Mark of the Web&quot;. Without deep modifications to the source code, all Chromium (e.g. Google Chrome) and Firefox-based web browsers also write the codice_1 stream to downloaded files.

Malware has used alternate data streams to hide code. Since the late 2000s, some malware scanners and other special tools check for alternate data streams. Due to the risks associated with ADS, particularly involving privacy and the codice_1 stream, there exists software specifically designed to strip streams from files (certain streams with perceived risk or all of them) in a user-friendly way.

NTFS Streams were introduced in Windows NT 3.1, to enable Services for Macintosh (SFM) to store resource forks. Although current versions of Windows Server no longer include SFM, third-party Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) products (such as GroupLogic&#x27;s ExtremeZ-IP) still use this feature of the file system.

=== File compression ===
Compression is enabled on a per-folder or per-file basis by setting the &#x27;compressed&#x27; attribute. When compression is enabled on a folder, any files moved or saved to that folder will be automatically compressed using LZNT1 algorithm (a variant of LZ77). The compression algorithm is designed to support cluster sizes of up to 4 KB; when the cluster size is greater than 4 KB on an NTFS volume, NTFS compression is not available. Data is compressed in 16-cluster chunks (up to 64 KB in size); if the compression reduces 64KB of data to 60KB or less, NTFS treats the unneeded 4KB pages like empty sparse file clusters—they are not written. This allows for reasonable random-access times as the OS merely has to follow the chain of fragments.

Compression works best with files that have repetitive content, are seldom written, are usually accessed sequentially, and are not themselves compressed. Single-user systems with limited hard disk space can benefit from NTFS compression for small files, from 4KB to 64KB or more, depending on compressibility. Files smaller than approximately 900 bytes are stored within the directory entry of the MFT.

==== Advantages ====
Users of fast multi-core processors will find improvements in application speed by compressing their applications and data as well as a reduction in space used. Even when SSD controllers already compress data, there is still a reduction in I/Os since less data is transferred.

According to research by Microsoft&#x27;s NTFS Development team, 50–60GB is a reasonable maximum size for a compressed file on an NTFS volume with a 4KB (default) cluster (block) size. This reasonable maximum size decreases sharply for volumes with smaller cluster sizes. 

==== Disadvantages ====
Large compressible files become highly fragmented since every chunk smaller than 64KB becomes a fragment. Flash memory, such as SSD drives do not have the head movement delays and high access time of mechanical hard disk drives, so fragmentation has only a smaller penalty.

If system files that are needed at boot time (such as drivers, NTLDR, winload.exe, or BOOTMGR) are compressed, the system may fail to boot correctly, because decompression filters are not yet loaded. Later editions of Windows do not allow important system files to be compressed.

=== System compression ===

Since Windows 10, Microsoft has introduced new file compression scheme based on the XPRESS algorithm with 4K/8K/16K block size and the LZX algorithm; both are variants of LZ77 updated with Huffman entropy coding and range coding, which LZNT1 lacked. These compression algorithms were taken from Windows Imaging Format (WIM file).

The new compression scheme is used by CompactOS feature, which reduces disk usage by compressing Windows system files. CompactOS is not an extension of NTFS file compression and does not use the &#x27;compressed&#x27; attribute; instead, it sets a reparse point on each compressed file with a WOF (Windows Overlay Filter) tag, but the actual data is stored in an alternate data stream named &quot;WofCompressedData&quot;, which is decompressed on-the-fly by a WOF filesystem filter driver, and the main file is an empty sparse file. This design is meant purely for read-only access, so any writes to compressed files result in an automatic decompression.

CompactOS compression is intended for OEMs who prepare OS images with the flag of the tool in Windows ADK, but it can also be manually turned on per file with the flag of the command. CompactOS algorithm avoids file fragmentation by writing compressed data in contiguously allocated chunks, unlike core NTFS compression.

CompactOS file compression is an improved version of WIMBoot feature introduced in Windows 8.1. WIMBoot reduces Windows disk usage by keeping system files in a compressed WIM image on a separate hidden disk partition. Similarly to CompactOS, Windows system directories only contain sparse files marked by a reparse point with a WOF tag, and Windows Overlay Filter driver decompresses file contents on-the-fly from the WIM image. WIMBoot is less effective than CompactOS though, as new updated versions of system files need to be written to the system partition, consuming disk space.

=== Sparse files ===

Sparse files are files interspersed with empty segments for which no actual storage space is used. To the applications, the file looks like an ordinary file with empty regions seen as regions filled with zeros; the file system maintains an internal list of such regions for each sparse file. A sparse file does not necessarily include sparse zeros areas; the &quot;sparse file&quot; attribute just means that the file is allowed to have them.

Database applications, for instance, may use sparse files. As with compressed files, the actual sizes of sparse files are not taken into account when determining quota limits.

=== Volume Shadow Copy ===
The Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) keeps historical versions of files and folders on NTFS volumes by copying old, newly overwritten data to shadow copy via copy-on-write technique. The user may later request an earlier version to be recovered. This also allows data backup programs to archive files currently in use by the file system.

Windows Vista also introduced persistent shadow copies for use with System Restore and Previous Versions features. Persistent shadow copies, however, are deleted when an older operating system mounts that NTFS volume. This happens because the older operating system does not understand the newer format of persistent shadow copies.

=== Transactions ===
As of Windows Vista, applications can use Transactional NTFS (TxF) to group multiple changes to files together into a single transaction. The transaction will guarantee that either all of the changes happen, or none of them do, and that no application outside the transaction will see the changes until they are committed.

It uses similar techniques as those used for Volume Shadow Copies (i.e. copy-on-write) to ensure that overwritten data can be safely rolled back, and a CLFS log to mark the transactions that have still not been committed, or those that have been committed but still not fully applied (in case of system crash during a commit by one of the participants).

Transactional NTFS does not restrict transactions to just the local NTFS volume, but also includes other transactional data or operations in other locations such as data stored in separate volumes, the local registry, or SQL databases, or the current states of system services or remote services. These transactions are coordinated network-wide with all participants using a specific service, the DTC, to ensure that all participants will receive same commit state, and to transport the changes that have been validated by any participant (so that the others can invalidate their local caches for old data or rollback their ongoing uncommitted changes). Transactional NTFS allows, for example, the creation of network-wide consistent distributed file systems, including with their local live or offline caches.

Microsoft now advises against using TxF: &quot;Microsoft strongly recommends developers utilize alternative means&quot; since &quot;TxF may not be available in future versions of Microsoft Windows&quot;.

=== Quotas ===
Disk quotas were introduced in NTFS v3. They allow the administrator of a computer that runs a version of Windows that supports NTFS to set a threshold of disk space that users may use. It also allows administrators to keep track of how much disk space each user is using. An administrator may specify a certain level of disk space that a user may use before they receive a warning, and then deny access to the user once they hit their upper limit of space. Disk quotas do not take into account NTFS&#x27;s transparent file-compression, should this be enabled. Applications that query the amount of free space will also see the amount of free space left to the user who has a quota applied to them.

=== Reparse points ===
Introduced in NTFS v3, NTFS reparse points are used by associating a reparse tag in the user space attribute of a file or directory. Microsoft includes several default tags including symbolic links, directory junction points and volume mount points. When the Object Manager parses a file system name lookup and encounters a reparse attribute, it will &quot;reparse&quot; the name lookup, passing the user controlled reparse data to every file system filter driver that is loaded into Windows. Each filter driver examines the reparse data to see whether it is associated with that reparse point, and if that filter driver determines a match, then it intercepts the file system request and performs its special functionality.

== Limitations ==

=== Resizing ===
Starting with Windows Vista Microsoft added the built-in ability to shrink or expand a partition. However, this ability does not relocate page file fragments or files that have been marked as unmovable, so shrinking a volume will often require relocating or disabling any page file, the index of Windows Search, and any Shadow Copy used by System Restore. Various third-party tools are capable of resizing NTFS partitions.

=== OneDrive ===
Since 2017, Microsoft requires the OneDrive file structure to reside on an NTFS disk. This is because OneDrive Files On-Demand feature uses NTFS reparse points to link files and folders that are stored in OneDrive to the local filesystem, making the file or folder unusable with any previous version of Windows, with any other NTFS file system driver, or any file system and backup utilities not updated to support it.

== Structure ==
NTFS is made up of several components including: a partition boot sector (PBS) that holds boot information; the master file table that stores a record of all files and folders in the filesystem; a series of meta files that help structure meta data more efficiently; data streams and locking mechanisms.

Internally, NTFS uses B-trees to index file system data. A file system journal is used to guarantee the integrity of the file system metadata but not individual files&#x27; content. Systems using NTFS are known to have improved reliability compared to FAT file systems.

NTFS allows any sequence of 16-bit values for name encoding (e.g. file names, stream names or index names) except 0x0000. This means UTF-16 code units are supported, but the file system does not check whether a sequence is valid UTF-16 (it allows any sequence of short values, not restricted to those in the Unicode standard). In Win32 namespace, any UTF-16 code units are case insensitive whereas in POSIX namespace they are case sensitive. File names are limited to 255 UTF-16 code units. Certain names are reserved in the volume root directory and cannot be used for files. These are codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9 (dot), codice_10, codice_11, codice_12, codice_13, codice_14, and codice_15. codice_9 (dot) and codice_15 are both directories; the others are files. The NT kernel limits full paths to 32,767 UTF-16 code units. There are some additional restrictions on code points and file names.

=== Partition Boot Sector (PBS) ===

This boot partition format is roughly based upon the earlier FAT filesystem, but the fields are in different locations. Some of these fields, especially the &quot;sectors per track&quot;, &quot;number of heads&quot; and &quot;hidden sectors&quot; fields may contain dummy values on drives where they either do not make sense or are not determinable.

The OS first looks at the 8 bytes at 0x30 to find the cluster number of the $MFT, then multiplies that number by the number of sectors per cluster (1 byte found at 0x0D). This value is the sector offset (LBA) to the $MFT, which is described below.

=== Master File Table === 
In NTFS, all file, directory and metafile data—file name, creation date, access permissions (by the use of access control lists), and size—are stored as metadata in the Master File Table (MFT). This abstract approach allowed easy addition of file system features during Windows NT&#x27;s development—an example is the addition of fields for indexing used by the Active Directory and the Windows Search. This also enables fast file search software to locate named local files and folders included in the MFT very quickly, without requiring any other index.

The MFT structure supports algorithms which minimize disk fragmentation. A directory entry consists of a filename and a &quot;file ID&quot; (analogous to the inode number), which is the record number representing the file in the Master File Table. The file ID also contains a reuse count to detect stale references. While this strongly resembles the W_FID of Files-11, other NTFS structures radically differ.

A partial copy of the MFT, called the MFT mirror, is stored to be used in case of corruption. If the first record of the MFT is corrupted, NTFS reads the second record to find the MFT mirror file. Locations for both files are stored in the boot sector.

=== Metafiles ===
NTFS contains several files that define and organize the file system. In all respects, most of these files are structured like any other user file ($Volume being the most peculiar), but are not of direct interest to file system clients. These metafiles define files, back up critical file system data, buffer file system changes, manage free space allocation, satisfy BIOS expectations, track bad allocation units, and store security and disk space usage information. All content is in an unnamed data stream, unless otherwise indicated.

These metafiles are treated specially by Windows, handled directly by the codice_18 driver and are difficult to directly view: special purpose-built tools are needed. As of Windows 7, the NTFS driver completely prohibits user access, resulting in a BSoD whenever an attempt to execute a metadata file is made. One such tool is the nfi.exe (&quot;NTFS File Sector Information Utility&quot;) that is freely distributed as part of the Microsoft &quot;OEM Support Tools&quot;. For example, to obtain information on the &quot;$MFT&quot;-Master File Table Segment the following command is used: Another way to bypass the restriction is to use 7-Zip&#x27;s file manager and go to the low-level NTFS path codice_19 (where codice_20 resembles any drive/partition). Here, 3 new folders will appear: codice_21, codice_22 (a pseudo-folder that 7-Zip uses to attach files deleted from the file system to view), and codice_23 (another pseudo-folder that contains all the NTFS metadata files). This trick can be used from removable devices (USB flash drives, external hard drives, SD cards, etc.) inside Windows, but doing this on the active partition requires offline access (namely WinRE).

=== Attribute lists, attributes, and streams ===
For each file (or directory) described in the MFT record, there is a linear repository of stream descriptors (also named &quot;attributes&quot;), packed together in one or more MFT records (containing the so-called &quot;attributes list&quot;), with extra padding to fill the fixed 1 KB size of every MFT record, and that fully describes the effective streams associated with that file.

Each attribute has an attribute type (a fixed-size integer mapping to an attribute definition in file ), an optional attribute name (for example, used as the name for an alternate data stream), and a value, represented in a sequence of bytes. For NTFS, the standard data of files, the alternate data streams, or the index data for directories are stored as attributes.

According to , some attributes can be either resident or non-resident. The attribute, which contains file data, is such an example. When the attribute is resident (which is represented by a flag), its value is stored directly in the MFT record. Otherwise, clusters are allocated for the data, and the cluster location information is stored as data runs in the attribute.
* For each file in the MFT, the attributes identified by &quot;attribute type, attribute name&quot; must be unique. Additionally, NTFS has some ordering constraints for these attributes.
* There is a predefined null attribute type, used to indicate the end of the list of attributes in one MFT record. It must be present as the last attribute in the record (all other storage space available after it will be ignored and just consists of padding bytes to match the record size in the MFT).
* Some attribute types are required and must be present in each MFT record, except unused records that are just indicated by null attribute types.
** This is the case for the attribute that is stored as a fixed-size record and contains the timestamps and other basic single-bit attributes (compatible with those managed by FAT in DOS or Windows 9x).
* Some attribute types cannot have a name and must remain anonymous.
** This is the case for the standard attributes, or for the preferred NTFS &quot;filename&quot; attribute type, or the &quot;short filename&quot; attribute type, when it is also present (for compatibility with DOS-like applications, see below). It is also possible for a file to contain only a short filename, in which case it will be the preferred one, as listed in the Windows Explorer.
** The filename attributes stored in the attribute list do not make the file immediately accessible through the hierarchical file system. In fact, all the filenames must be indexed separately in at least one other directory on the same volume. There it must have its own MFT record and its own security descriptors and attributes that reference the MFT record number for this file. This allows the same file or directory to be &quot;hardlinked&quot; several times from several containers on the same volume, possibly with distinct filenames.
* The default data stream of a regular file is a stream of type but with an anonymous name, and the ADSs are similar but must be named.
* On the other hand, the default data stream of directories has a distinct type, but are not anonymous: they have an attribute name (&quot;&quot; in NTFS 3+) that reflects its indexing format.

All attributes of a given file may be displayed by using the nfi.exe (&quot;NTFS File Sector Information Utility&quot;) that is freely distributed as part of the Microsoft &quot;OEM Support Tools&quot;.

Windows system calls may handle alternate data streams. Depending on the operating system, utility and remote file system, a file transfer might silently strip data streams. A safe way of copying or moving files is to use the BackupRead and BackupWrite system calls, which allow programs to enumerate streams, to verify whether each stream should be written to the destination volume and to knowingly skip unwanted streams.

=== Resident vs. non-resident attributes ===
To optimize the storage and reduce the I/O overhead for the very common case of attributes with very small associated value, NTFS prefers to place the value within the attribute itself (if the size of the attribute does not then exceed the maximum size of an MFT record), instead of using the MFT record space to list clusters containing the data; in that case, the attribute will not store the data directly but will just store an allocation map (in the form of &quot;data runs&quot;) pointing to the actual data stored elsewhere on the volume. When the value can be accessed directly from within the attribute, it is called &quot;resident data&quot; (by computer forensics workers). The amount of data that fits is highly dependent on the file&#x27;s characteristics, but 700 to 800 bytes is common in single-stream files with non-lengthy filenames and no ACLs.
* Some attributes (such as the preferred filename, the basic file attributes) cannot be made non-resident. For non-resident attributes, their allocation map must fit within MFT records.
* Encrypted-by-NTFS, sparse data streams, or compressed data streams cannot be made resident.
* The format of the allocation map for non-resident attributes depends on its capability of supporting sparse data storage. In the current implementation of NTFS, once a non-resident data stream has been marked and converted as sparse, it cannot be changed back to non-sparse data, so it cannot become resident again, unless this data is fully truncated, discarding the sparse allocation map completely.
* When a non-resident attribute is so fragmented that its effective allocation map cannot fit entirely within one MFT record, NTFS stores the attribute in multiple records. The first one among them is called the base record, while the others are called extension records. NTFS creates a special attribute to store information mapping different parts of the long attribute to the MFT records, which means the allocation map may be split into multiple records. The itself can also be non-resident, but its own allocation map must fit within one MFT record.
* When there are too many attributes for a file (including ADS&#x27;s, extended attributes, or security descriptors), so that they cannot fit all within the MFT record, extension records may also be used to store the other attributes, using the same format as the one used in the base MFT record, but without the space constraints of one MFT record.

The allocation map is stored in a form of &quot;data runs&quot; with compressed encoding. Each data run represents a contiguous group of clusters that store the attribute value. For files on a multi-GB volume, each entry can be encoded as 5 to 7 bytes, which means a MFT record can store about 100 such data runs. However, as the also has a size limit, it is dangerous to have more than 1 million fragments of a single file on an NTFS volume, which also implies that it is in general not a good idea to use NTFS compression on a file larger than .

The NTFS file system driver will sometimes attempt to relocate the data of some of the attributes that can be made non-resident into the clusters, and will also attempt to relocate the data stored in clusters back to the attribute inside the MFT record, based on priority and preferred ordering rules, and size constraints.

Since resident files do not directly occupy clusters (&quot;allocation units&quot;), it is possible for an NTFS volume to contain more files on a volume than there are clusters. For example, a partition NTFS formats with 19,543,064 clusters of . Subtracting system files (a log file, a 2,442,888-byte Bitmap file, and about 25 clusters of fixed overhead) leaves 19,526,158 clusters free for files and indices. Since there are four MFT records per cluster, this volume theoretically could hold almost 4 × 19,526,158 = 78,104,632 resident files.

=== Opportunistic locks ===
Opportunistic file locks (oplocks) allow clients to alter their buffering strategy for a given file or stream in order to increase performance and reduce network use. Oplocks apply to the given open stream of a file and do not affect oplocks on a different stream.

Oplocks can be used to transparently access files in the background. A network client may avoid writing information into a file on a remote server if no other process is accessing the data, or it may buffer read-ahead data if no other process is writing data.

Windows supports four different types of oplocks:
* Level 2 (or shared) oplock: multiple readers, no writers (i.e. read caching).
* Level 1 (or exclusive) oplock: exclusive access with arbitrary buffering (i.e. read and write caching).
* Batch oplock (also exclusive): a stream is opened on the server, but closed on the client machine (i.e. read, write and handle caching).
* Filter oplock (also exclusive): applications and file system filters can &quot;back out&quot; when others try to access the same stream (i.e. read and write caching) (since Windows 2000)

Opportunistic locks have been enhanced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 with per-client oplock keys.

=== Time ===
Windows NT and its descendants keep internal timestamps as UTC and make the appropriate conversions for display purposes; all NTFS timestamps are in UTC.

For historical reasons, the versions of Windows that do not support NTFS all keep time internally as local zone time, and therefore so does the FAT file system. This means that when files are copied or moved between NTFS and FAT partitions, the OS needs to convert timestamps on the fly. But if some files are moved when daylight saving time (DST) is in effect, and other files are moved when standard time is in effect, there can be some ambiguities in the conversions. As a result, especially shortly after one of the days on which local zone time changes, users may observe that some files have timestamps that are incorrect by one hour. Due to the differences in implementation of DST in different jurisdictions, this can result in a potential timestamp error of up to 4 hours in any given 12 months.

This problem is further exacerbated for any computers for which local time zone changes sometimes (e.g. due to moving the computer from one time zone to another, as often happens with laptops and other portable devices).

<text>Johan August Arfwedson (12 January 1792 – 28 October 1841) was a Swedish chemist who discovered the chemical element lithium in 1817 by isolating it as a salt.

== Life and work ==

Arfwedson belonged to a wealthy bourgeois family, the son of the wholesale merchant and factory owner Jacob Arfwedson and his spouse, Anna Elisabeth Holtermann. The younger Arfwedson matriculated as a student at the University of Uppsala in 1803 (at the time, matriculating at a young age was common for aristocratic and wealthy students), completed a degree in Law in 1809 and a second degree in mineralogy in 1812. In the latter year, he received an unpaid position in the Royal Board of Mines, where he advanced to the position of notary (still without a salary) in 1814.

In Stockholm, Arfwedson knew the chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius and received access to his private laboratory, where he discovered the element lithium in 1817, during analysis of the mineral petalite. The actual isolation of lithium metal would be done by others.

In 1818 and 1819, Arfwedson made a European journey, partly in the society of Berzelius. After coming home, Arfwedson built his own laboratory on his estate. He spent the larger part of his remaining life administering and multiplying his inherited wealth.

He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1821.

The rare mineral arfvedsonite was named after him.

<text>A semi-automatic rifle is a firearm that fires a single round per trigger pull while automatically loading the next cartridge. The actions of these rifles use a portion of the fired cartridge&#x27;s energy to eject the spent casing and load a new round into the chamber, readying the rifle to be fired again. This design differs from manually operated rifles such as bolt-action and lever-action rifles, which require manual chambering of a new round before firing again, and fully-automatic rifles, which continue firing as long as the trigger remains depressed.

==History==
In 1883, Hiram Maxim patented a recoil-operated conversion of a Winchester rifle. Another early design for a recoil-operated semi-automatic rifle was by Ferdinand Mannlicher, who unveiled his design in 1885, building on earlier work from 1883. Several of his early models, including the Mannlicher Model 85, the 91, the 93, and the 95, used non-gas-operated mechanisms. However, the designs remained prototypes because of challenges associated with the black powder used in their cartridges (based around the Austrian 11×58 mm R M/77), such as low velocity and excessive fouling. The adoption of smokeless powder later facilitated the practical development of fully-automatic and semi-automatic firearms.

Mannlicher&#x27;s designs contributed to the evolution of later firearms, including the Browning M1917, M1919, and M2 Browning machine guns. In the early 1880s, Mannlicher began producing versions of his rifles designed for smokeless powder, continuing his work until he eventually died in 1904.

===Blowback semi-automatic===
In 1903 and 1905, the Winchester Repeating Arms Company introduced the first low-power blowback (shell-operated) semi-automatic rifles firing rimfire and centerfire ammunition. The Winchester Model 1903 and the Winchester Model 1905 both operated on the blowback principle to function. Designed by Thomas.C.Johnson, the Model 1903 was commercially successful and remained in production until 1932 – when it was succeeded by the Winchester Model 63.

By the early 20th century, several manufacturers began producing semi-automatic .22 caliber rifles, including Winchester, Remington, Fabrique Nationale, and Savage Arms, all using the direct blowback system of operation. Winchester later introduced a .351 Winchester Self-Loading semi-automatic rifle, the Model 1907, as an upgraded version of the Model 1905. It offered greater power than its .22 caliber predecessor and also utilized a blowback system. Both the Model 1905 and Model 1907 saw limited military and police use.

===Early semi-automatic rifles===
In 1883, Artillery Officer Wilhelm H. O. Madsen and Julius A. N. Rasmussen, the intendant of the Copenhagen arms factory, initiated the development of recoil-operated self-loading firearm designs. By 1887, they had produced a functional prototype, later designated the M1888 Forsøgsrekylgevær. The Danish military tested this rifle but ultimately didn&#x27;t adopt it. Subsequently, the pair developed a new design known as the M1896 Flaadens Rekylgevær. This model underwent testing by the Danish military and was deemed reliable. Consequently, 60 units were procured for the Danish Navy, making it one of the earliest semi-automatic rifles officially adopted by a military force.

In the final years of the 19th century and early 20th century, experiments and patents with gas-operated reloading were developed by Hiram Maxim and Richard Paulson as well as a gas-operated conversion system from an American inventor named Henry Pitcher. Other designs were also developed, such as the Cei-Rigotti in 1900.

In 1906, Remington Arms introduced the Remington Auto-loading Repeating Rifle which was renamed the Model 8 in 1911 and marketed as a sporting rifle. It was sold in Europe by FN Herstal as the FN Browning 1900. The rifle is a locked breech, long recoil action designed by John Browning, and had .25, .30, .32, and .35 caliber variants. In 1936, the Model 81 superseded the Model 8 and was offered in .300 Savage as well as the original Remington calibers.

In 1908, General Manuel Mondragón patented the Mondragón rifle, designated the M1908. The rifle was used by Mexican forces in the Mexican Revolution, making Mexico the first nation to use a semi-automatic rifle in battle, in 1911.
Shortly after the Mondragón rifle was produced, France introduced its semi-automatic rifle, the Fusil Automatique Modele 1917, also known as the Repetier-Selbstlader-Gewehr M1917 (RSC M1917). It had a locked breech, gas-operated action that was similar in its mechanical principles to the American M1 Garand. However, the shortened and improved version, the Model 1918 saw more use during the Moroccan Rif War from 1921 to 1926. The bolt-action Lebel Model 1886 rifle remained the standard French infantry rifle until it was replaced in 1936 by another bolt-action rifle, the MAS-36.

The United Kingdom experimented with self-loading rifles during the interwar period, intending to replace the bolt-action Lee–Enfield with a self-loading rifle. This plan was discarded when the Second World War became imminent and the United Kingdom hastily rearmed with more traditional weapons designs.

===Gas-operated rifles===
 Springfield, Massachusetts – John Garand, a Canadian-born firearms designer, was tasked with designing a basic gas-actuated self-loading infantry rifle and carbine that would eject the spent cartridge and reload a new round using a gas-operated system. It took 15 years to perfect the M1 prototype model to meet all the U.S. Army specifications. The resulting &quot;Semi-Automatic, Caliber .30, M1 Rifle&quot; was patented by Garand in 1932, approved by the U.S. Army on January 9, 1936, and underwent mass production in 1940.General George S. Patton described the M1 Garand as &quot;the greatest battle implement ever devised&quot;.&quot;&quot; It replaced the bolt action M1903 Springfield and was the first gas-operated semi-automatic rifle adopted as a national standard-issue service rifle, and was often referred to as the &quot;Garand Rifle&quot;. During World War II, over 4,000,000 M1 rifles were manufactured.

The Soviet AVS-36, SVT-38, and SVT-40, as well as the German Gewehr 43, were semi-automatic gas-operated rifles issued during World War II in relatively small numbers. In practice, they did not replace the bolt-action rifle as a standard infantry weapon of their respective nations—Germany produced 402,000 Gewehr 43 rifles, and over 14,000,000 of the Kar98k.

Another gas-operated semi-automatic rifle developed toward the end of World War II was the SKS. Designed by Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov in 1945, it came equipped with a bayonet and could be loaded with ten rounds using a stripper clip. It was the first widely issued rifle to use the 7.62×39mm cartridge. By the end of World War II, however, semi-automatic rifles had been largely superseded in military usage by their select-fire counterparts - weapons such as the AK-47, FN FAL, and M16 limited the viability of widespread deployment of semi-automatic rifles.

Gradually, military doctrine increasingly prioritized the volume of fire over individual marksmanship. During World War II, American ground forces fired approximately 25,000 rounds for each enemy killed. This number rose to 50,000 rounds in the Korean War, and rose again, to 200,000, during the Vietnam War. The first fully-automatic rifle to see widespread usage was the German STG-44, which was reportedly well-liked by troops, as the 30-round select-fire rifle gave them much more flexibility than the bolt-action Karabiner 98k.

Ultimately, fully-automatic rifles would become standard in military usage, as their firepower was superior to that of a semi-automatic rifle. However, both semi-automatic and bolt-action rifles are still widely used today in military service in specific roles, such as designated marksman rifles, which prioritize accuracy over volume of fire. Furthermore, to accommodate for this greater firepower, battle rifles were mostly replaced by assault rifles, whose lighter bullets allowed more ammunition to be carried at once. Where semi-automatic rifles continue to be used, they are usually in higher calibers, such as the .50 BMG Barrett M82.

==Operation==

Semi-automatic rifles use gas, blow-forward, blow back, or recoil energy to eject the casing after a round has been fired, to chamber a new cartridge from the magazine, and to reset the action. This enables another round to be fired once the trigger is depressed again.

Semi-automatic rifles can be fed by an en-bloc clip, external magazine, or stripper clip.

==Advantages==
The primary advantage of semi-automatic rifles is their ability to fire multiple sequential shots quickly, as avoiding manually chambering cartridges helps to maintain the aiming position. Repeatedly engaging single or multiple targets rapidly greatly increases the effectiveness of a firearm in most applications. Semi-automatic rifles can typically more than double the hits at close range and increase hits by about 50% at longer distances compared to manually loaded rifles. The added weight of springs and fittings in self-loading mechanisms, along with some of the cartridge energy being used to reload, can help reduce recoil. Reduced recoil helps keep the rifle on target for successive shots, improving overall accuracy.

==Disadvantages==
A self-loading mechanism designed for specific cartridge dimensions and power may fail to reload dirty or bent cartridges, struggle to extract low-power training cartridges, or be damaged by cartridges of excessively high power. Some rifles require lubricated cartridges, making them prone to collecting dirt. Reliability issues in the mechanism can negate the advantage of faster firing, potentially lowering the rate of fire compared to manually loaded rifles if not designed for easy manual reloading. The United Kingdom regarded the reliable rate of fire from manually loaded rifles as nearly as high as self-loading rifles as recently as World War II.

Semi-automatic rifles are uniquely susceptible to slamfire malfunctions caused by abrupt cartridge acceleration during self-loading. Slamfire discharges are unlikely to hit the target and may cause collateral damage.

The time required for changing or reloading magazines can reduce the effectiveness of a rifle, as it imposes a duration limit on the continuous rate of fire. High-capacity magazines increase the rifle&#x27;s weight and typically reduce feeding reliability due to the varying spring tension ranging from a full magazine to a nearly empty magazine. Additionally, detachable magazines are generally less durable than internal magazines.

The complexity of a self-loading mechanism makes self-loading rifles more expensive to manufacture and heavier than manually loaded rifles. The semi-automatic M1 Garand weighs about 410 grams (0.9 lbs.) more than the bolt-action M1903 Springfield it replaced, an increase of seven percent. American development of a self-loading infantry rifle began with the .276 Pedersen cartridge in recognition of the difficulties of producing reliable self-loading mechanisms for more powerful cartridges. Although the M1 Garand was ultimately adapted to fire the .30-06 Springfield cartridge at the insistence of General Douglas MacArthur, most subsequent self-loading rifles for infantry use have been chambered for less powerful cartridges to reduce weight, making the service rifles easier to carry.

==Select examples==
== Civilian uses for semi-automatic rifles ==

=== Sport shooting ===
Semi-automatic rifles are often used for sport shooting. There are various types of sport shooting, ranging from rapid-fire, target, and distance shooting. Shooting clubs in America became increasingly common in the 1830s, and have since grown in popularity.

=== Hunting ===
Semi-automatic rifles have grown in popularity amongst hunters. Some hunters use semi-automatic rifles, including AR-15 style models, citing their compact design and customization options, effectively making it easier to traverse rugged terrain while tracking a target and providing a large variety of customization ranging from scopes and muzzle devices to different calibers. Semi-automatic fire greatly assists in maintaining one&#x27;s sight picture, which is especially important when follow-up shots are required. Due to their demand, the manufacturers of semi-automatic firearms have greatly increased the effective firing distance of their products compared to the first semi-automatics sold on the civilian market.

=== Self-defense ===
Semi-automatic rifles have been used for self-defense. But at least in the US, this use has been rare, totaling only between 51 and 69 self-defense incidents with AR-15-style semi-automatic rifles over the span of 9 1/2 years.

<text>Racquetball is a racquet sport and a team sport played with a hollow rubber ball on an indoor or outdoor court. Joseph Sobek invented the modern sport of racquetball in 1950, adding a stringed racquet to paddleball in order to increase velocity and control. Unlike most racquet sports, such as tennis and badminton, there is no net to hit the ball over, and, unlike squash, no tin (out of bounds area at the bottom of front wall) to hit the ball above. Also, the court&#x27;s walls, floor, and ceiling are legal playing surfaces, with the exception of court-specific designated hinders being out-of-bounds.
Racquetball is played between various players on a team who try to bounce the ball with the racquet onto the ground so it hits the wall, so that an opposing team’s player cannot bounce it back to the wall.

The sport is very similar to 40×20 American handball, which is played in many countries. It is also very similar to the British sport Squash 57, which was called racketball before 2016 (see below for a comparison).

== History ==

Joe Sobek is credited with inventing the sport of racquetball in the Greenwich, Connecticut, YMCA, though not with naming it. A professional tennis and American handball player, Sobek sought a fast-paced sport that was easy to learn and play. He designed the first strung paddle, devised a set of rules, based on those of squash, handball, and paddleball, and named his game &quot;paddle rackets&quot;.

In February 1952, Sobek founded the National Paddle Rackets Association (NPRA), codified the rules, and had the rules printed as a booklet. The new sport was rapidly adopted and became popular through Sobek&#x27;s continual promotion of it; he was aided by the existence of some 40,000 handball courts in the country&#x27;s YMCAs and Jewish Community Centers, wherein racquetball could be played.

In 1969, aided by Robert W. Kendler, the president-founder of the U.S. Handball Association (USHA), the International Racquetball Association (IRA) was founded using the name coined by Bob McInerney, a professional tennis player. That same year, the IRA assumed the national championship from the NPRA. In 1973, after a dispute with the IRA board of directors, Kendler formed a competing organization called the National Racquetball Club (NRC), which eventually became the dominant professional tour in the 1970s. For a period of time in the 1970s, the NRC and the IRA both offered competing &quot;Amateur&quot; and &quot;Professional&quot; tournaments, but by the late 1970s the NRC was focused on the professional game while the IRA became focused on the amateur side, and became recognized by the United States Olympic Committee as the official National Governing Body (NGB) of the sport.

The IRA was a founding member of the International Racquetball Federation (IRF). Eventually, the IRA became the American Amateur Racquetball Association (AARA); in late 1995, it renamed itself as the United States Racquetball Association (USRA). In 2003, the USRA again renamed itself to USA Racquetball (USAR), to mirror other Olympic sports associations, even though Racquetball is not an Olympic sport.

Kendler used his publication &quot;ACE&quot; to promote both handball and racquetball. Starting in the 1970s, and aided by the fitness boom of that decade, the sport&#x27;s popularity increased to an estimated 3.1 million players by 1974. Consequent to increased demand, racquetball clubs and courts were founded and built, and sporting goods manufacturers began producing racquetball-specific equipment. This growth continued until the early 1980s, and declining in the decade&#x27;s latter part when racquet clubs converted to physical fitness clubs, in service to a wider clientele, adding aerobics exercise classes and physical fitness and bodybuilding machines. Since then, the number of players has remained steady, an estimated 5.6 million.

The NRC and Kendler ruled over professional racquetball throughout its early stages of growth, but upon his death in 1982 the organization declared bankruptcy and the professional men&#x27;s tours fell into disarray. Several professional governing bodies ruled the Men&#x27;s pro tour throughout the 1980s, and the Women broke away and self-organized their own professional tour in the same time period. Eventually, after the tour collapsed in the fall of 1988, a new men&#x27;s tour called the International Racquetball Tour (IRT) was created by Oregon State President and popular tournament promotor Hank Marcus, which remains the primary men&#x27;s professional sanctioning body to this day. The women&#x27;s pro tour has gone by several names in the interim, but is currently known as the Ladies Professional Racquetball tour (LPRT) and has marketing partnerships with the USAR, IRT, and other sanctioning bodies to this day .

== United Kingdom ==

In 1976, Ian D.W. Wright created the sport of racketball based on U.S. racquetball. British racketball is played in a long by wide squash court – shorter and wider than the U.S. racquetball court - using a smaller, less-dynamic ball than the American racquetball. In racketball, the ceiling is out-of-bounds. The racketball is served after a bounce on the floor then struck into play with the racket. Scoring is like squash with point-a-rally scoring of up to 11 points. The British Racketball Association was formed on 13 February 1984, and confirmed by the English Sports Council as the sport&#x27;s governing body on 30 October 1984. The first National Racketball Championship was held in London on 1 December 1984. The sport is now played in countries where squash is played, Australia, Bermuda, France, Germany, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, Ireland and Sweden. Currently, racketball also is played in parts of North America.

In 1988, the British Racketball Association merged with the Squash Rackets Association. England Squash &amp; Racketball is now recognised by Sport England as the English national governing body for the sports of squash and racketball. There is now an established UK Racketball Tournament Series consisting of 8 events around the UK, which forms the basis of the national rankings along with the National Racketball championships held annually at The Edgbaston Priory Club.

In 2016, World Squash Federation announced an international &#x27;re-branding&#x27; of racketball as Squash 57, the 57 referring to the diameter of the ball, in order to emphasize both its membership of the &#x27;squash rackets&#x27; family, and its distinctiveness from the U.S. racquetball.

== Governing bodies ==

The International Racquetball Federation (IRF) governs the World Racquetball Championships, which were first held in 1981 in conjunction with the first World Games. The second World Championships were played in 1984, and since then have been held biennially in August. Players from the United States have won the most World Championship titles.

The IRF also runs the World Junior Racquetball Championships that occur annually in either late October, or early to mid November, as well as the annual World Senior Racquetball Championships for players who are 35 years of age or older.

The sport has a high appeal in the Americas, and because of this racquetball has been included in the Pan American Games in 1995, 1999, 2003, 2011, 2015 and Lima 2019. And will be part of the games again in Santiago 2023. Racquetball has also been included in the World Games on five occasions: 1981, 1989, 1993, 2009 and 2013, and is on the program for 2022.
There men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s professional racquetball organizations. The International Racquetball Tour (IRT) is the men&#x27;s professional organization, and the Ladies Professional Racquetball Tour (LPRT) is the women&#x27;s professional organization. Both began in the 1980s.

== Equipment ==

This court and equipment are required for playing racquetball:
* A racquetball court; fully enclosed indoor or outdoor with a front wall. The standard racquetball court is rectangular: 40 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 20 feet high with red lines defining the service and serve reception areas. There are variations on the standard court with some courts having sidewalls that don&#x27;t extend the full length of the court and some courts don&#x27;t have any sidewalls.

The &quot;service box&quot; is formed by the &quot;short line&quot; (a solid red line running the court&#x27;s width parallel to the front and back walls at a distance of 20 feet) and the &quot;service line&quot; (which runs parallel to the short line and is 15 feet from the front wall). Within the service box there are two sets of lines perpendicular to the short and service lines.

One set of lines is 18 inches from, and parallel to, the side walls. Along with the short line, service line, and side wall these lines define the doubles box, where the non-serving doubles partner stands during the serve; 36 inches from the side wall is another set of lines which, along with the short line and the service line, define an area that the server must not enter if he wishes to hit a drive serve between himself and the nearest side wall. The &quot;receiving line&quot; is a parallel dashed line 5 feet behind the short line.

Other equipment needed:

* A racquetball; a dynamic (bouncy) rubber ball of 2.25 in. (57 mm) diameter
* A racquetball racquet; no longer than 22 inches
* Racquetball eyeguards (mandatory during competitions; some recreational players play without eyeguards but this is not recommended, as being hit in the eye by the ball can cause serious injury and/or permanent vision damage).

Racquetball differs from other racquet sports as most competitive players wear a glove on their racquet hand for the purpose of getting a better grip on the racquet (similar to golfers using a glove when driving), but gloves are optional equipment. Also, players usually wear a comfortable short sleeved shirt and shorts, as well as racquetball court shoes designed for enabling quick lateral as well as forward and backward movement.

== Ball colors ==

Racquetballs are manufactured in a variety of colors such as blue, green, purple, black, red, and pink, and some are for specific purposes (e.g., outdoor play and indoor play), but the differences are unlikely to matter for recreational play. Beginners are recommended to use a blue ball by Penn, Ektelon, or Wilson. The blue ball is the most commonly used and it is the most neutral ball for average speed and accuracy of contact. Green balls are similar to blue balls. In the United States the main choices of ball are blue and green for tournament play. In some cases the International Pro Racquetball Tour (IRT) will use a purple Penn HD ball as the official ball. A black ball is often used in tournaments for senior players because the ball is designed to be slower moving and allows for longer rallies. The red ball is the fastest in production, and they are known as Red Ektelon Fireballs. This ball is heavier and allows for a quicker pace.

Balls do break occasionally, and will lose their bounce over time even without breaking. To keep balls around for a long time it is best to keep them in a room temperature setting and keep them out of extreme cold or heat because this will cause the balls to become less effective and lose their bounce.

== Rules ==

Play begins with the serve. The serving player must bounce the ball on the floor once and hit it directly to the front wall, making the ball hit the floor beyond the short line; otherwise the serve counts as a fault. The ball may touch one side wall, but not two, prior to hitting the floor; hitting both side walls after the front wall (but before the floor) is a &quot;three wall serve,&quot; and a fault. Also, serving the ball into the front wall so that it rebounds to the back wall without hitting the floor first is a long serve, and a fault.

Other fault serves include a ceiling serve, in which the ball touches the ceiling after the front wall, and serving before the receiving player is ready. Also, the server must wait until the ball passes the short line before stepping out of the service box, otherwise it is a fault serve.

If the server hits the ball directly to any surface other than the front wall the server immediately loses serve regardless of whether it was first or second serve.

After the ball bounces behind the short line, or passes the receiving line, the ball is in play and the opposing player(s) may play it.

Usually, the server is allowed two opportunities (called first serve and second serve) to put the ball into play (two serve rule), although elite level competitions often allow the server only one opportunity (one serve rule).

After a successful serve, players alternate hitting the ball against the front wall. The player returning the hit may allow the ball to bounce once on the floor or hit the ball on the fly. However, once the player returning the shot has hit the ball, it must strike the front wall before striking the floor. Unlike during the serve, a ball in play may touch as many walls, including the ceiling, as necessary so long as it reaches the front wall without striking the floor.

=== Scoring ===

If the server wins the rally, then the server scores one point and continues to serve. If the opposing player wins the rally, then no point is scored, but that player then takes over serving.

Several different scoring methods have been or are used in the sport.

– Under USA Racquetball Amateur scoring rules, matches are best of three games with the first two games to 15 points and a third game to 11 points, if necessary. USA Racquetball rules do not require players to win by two, so a match score line could read 15–14, 14–15, 11–10.

– Racquetball Canada matches are also the best of three format two games to 15, tiebreaker to 11, but require a winning margin of at least two points.

– From 1981 to 2017, the IRT&#x27;s scoring was best-of-five games to 11 points, requiring a two-point margin for victory. However, in December 2017 the tour announced they were modifying their scoring methods to be in line with USAR and IRF standards at the time, and converted to the standard two games to 15, tiebreaker to 11 format.

– International competitions run by the International Racquetball Federation (IRF) also followed the two-games to 15, tiebreaker to 11 format from 1981 (inception) until 2022, when they announced that international competitions were going to move to Rally Scoring. IRF competitions will now be played best 3 of 5 games to 15, win by one except in the last game, with rally scoring. However, the IRF immediately modified its rally scoring limits and announced that the 2022 World games and World Juniors would be 3 out of 5 games to 11, win by two. The IRF cited several factors for this change: length of matches, confusing scoring system to casual fans, and the need for faster matches to accommodate more matches. IRF&#x27;s pivot to rally scoring had an immediate reaction in the NGBs, as most IRF qualifying events in USAR, Racquetball Canada, and other NGBs are now played under the IRF&#x27;s rally scoring rules.

=== Hinders ===

Due to the nature of the game, players often occupy the space their opponent(s) want(s) to occupy. This may result in a player blocking his opponent&#x27;s ability to play the ball. Such occurrences are termed either hinders or penalty hinders. A hinder is a replay of the current rally (the server resumes play at the first serve), while a penalty hinder results in the player who caused the avoidable obstruction to lose the rally. A type of hinder is a screen in which the player is unable to see the ball prior to it passing the opponent.

The difference between a hinder and a penalty hinder (or formerly an avoidable hinder) is that in the latter case a player has missed out on a clear opportunity to make a rally-winning shot due to the obstruction by the player&#x27;s opponent, while in the former case the opportunity missed would not clearly have led to a winning shot. This difference is almost always a judgment call by the referee (if available).

There is also a &quot;court&quot; hinder in which some part of the playing field caused the ball to bounce untrue. Often this is the door frame or (recessed) handle or a flaw in the floor or walls. In this case, the rally is a re-serve.

=== Game variations ===

Racquetball games can be played with two, three or four players, with doubles or singles matches being most common. Two player games are called singles or &quot;one-up&quot; (one vs. one for the entire game), while four player games are doubles with two pairs playing against each other (two vs. two for the entire game). Tournament competitions have divisions for singles or doubles or both.

Three-player games are most commonly called &quot;Cut-throat&quot; and sometimes &quot;Ironman&quot; (two-on-one for the entire game) where each player takes turns serving to the other two, who play as a team against the serving player. Another three-player game is &quot;California&quot;, &quot;In-and-Out&quot;, or &quot;King of the Court&quot; where play is 1 vs. 1 with the third player remaining in the back court out of play while the other two play a rally; the rally winner then serves to the player who was sitting out, and the rally loser stays out of play. Another three-player variation is &quot;Sevens&quot; in which one player plays against two players as a team, with the game being played to seven points; if the two player team gets to seven first, the game is over, but if the solo player gets to seven first then the game continues to 14; if the solo player again reaches 14 first, then the game continues to 21, where the game ends regardless of whether the solo player or the two player team reach 21 first.

== Shots of the game ==
=== Service ===

Serve style varies drastically from player to player. Generally, they are divided into two types: offensive and defensive. Most players use an offensive serve for the first serve, and a defensive serve if they need to hit a second serve. Of the offensive serves, the most common is the drive. The intention with this serve is for the ball to travel low and fast towards either back corner, and to bounce twice before striking either side wall or the back wall. If the opponent is adjusting to the drive serve, the server will throw in any variety of jam serves.

A &quot;jam serve&quot; is an offensive serve which attempts to catch the opponent off balance by making use of difficult angles and unfrequented play space. The most common jam serve is the Z-serve, which strikes the front wall close to a side wall. The ball bounces quickly off the side wall, then strikes the floor and then the opposite side wall about 30–35 feet back. Depending upon the spin the server gives the Z-serve, the resulting carom may prove unpredictable and difficult to return. Side spin may cause the ball to bounce parallel to the back wall.

A &quot;pinch serve&quot; is similar to a drive serve; however, the ball strikes a side wall very low and close to the serving box. With the appropriate spin, the ball has little bounce, and is difficult to return. It is possible that a successful serve would strike the sidewall before the short line, and land on the floor after the short line.

If the player faults on the first serve, they will usually hit a defensive serve. Defensive serves do not usually garner aces, but they are designed to generate a weak return by the opponent, thereby setting up the server to win the point. Most defensive serves are any variety of lob serves. A plain lob serve is a ball hit with a long, high arch into either back corner. The goal is to hit the ball so that it lands as close as possible to the back wall, giving the opponent very little room to hit a solid return. A junk lob takes a shallower arch, and lands close to the side wall somewhere between the dotted line and the back wall. This lob is intended to deceive the opponent into thinking he has an easy kill. However, since the ball is in the deep zone, it will more likely set up the server for an offensive shot.

=== Offensive shots ===

Straight-in shots are usually meant to hit the front wall as low as possible. If the ball contacts the front wall so low as to bounce twice before it reaches the service line it is called a &quot;kill&quot; shot. Straight-in shots are normally attempted with the idea of hitting toward the area of the court the opponent cannot cover.

Straight-in shots hit where the opponent cannot return them are called down-the-line and cross court passing shots. Often kill shots are returned very close to the back wall as the ball is moving towards the front wall.

Pinches and splats are shots that strike the side wall before the front wall. This often makes the ball bounce twice quickly to end the rally. Pinches normally strike the side wall towards the front part of the court, often within a few inches from the front wall.

The &quot;splat&quot; shot is an elongated pinch that strikes the side wall towards the back part of the court. It often makes a distinctive splatting sound. The advantage to a splat shot, beyond an unpredictable angle, is that it creates a longer distance to travel forward for the opponent who is held between a tension of going forward and staying back because of velocity of passing shots.

Pinches are classified as frontside or reverse. A right-handed player shooting a forehand shot to the right front corner is shooting a frontside pinch. A right-handed player shooting to the left front corner is a reverse pinch. A right-handed player shoots a backhand frontside pinch to the left corner and a reverse double pinch to the right corner. Everything for a left-handed player would be the opposite.

The dink is another very effective offensive shot designed to end the point. It is a shot very low to the front wall hit very softly so as to bounce twice before the opponent can get to it. Dinks are most effective when the opponent is positioned deep in the court.

Another important shot type is the &quot;Z&quot; shot. This shot is effective at confusing and tiring out an opponent. To hit a &quot;Z&quot; shot one hits the side wall hard and up high causing the ball to hit the front then the other side wall then back to the original side wall. If done correctly, the path of the ball will be Z-shaped. This shot can have confusing bounces which can frustrate opponents. If done correctly, a &quot;Z&quot; shot will apply spin to the ball on the final bounce as well, causing it to rebound perpendicular to the second wall and fall parallel to the back wall, the closer the better. This makes the &quot;Z&quot; shot very difficult to return.

=== Defensive shots ===

Defensive shots are defined as shots which are not returned low to the front wall.

The ceiling ball shot is the primary defensive shot. This is a shot that strikes the ceiling at or near the front wall. The ball will bounce once in the forecourt and should then travel in a high arc to arrive as close to, and as vertical to, the back wall as possible. Often this is aimed at the corner which would require a backhand return by the opponent. This makes it difficult for the opponent to return the ball as he cannot make a full arc of the racquet. However, if the ball comes down too long or too short of the back wall, this can allow the opponent a kill shot.

Another defensive shot is the high Z. Used when the defensive player is near the front wall, the high Z is hit ten feet high or higher into the front wall near a corner. The ball then bounces from the side wall all the way to the opposite side wall, usually traveling over the top of the opponent, hitting the opposite side wall with spin. The spin will cause the ball to leave the opposite wall almost perpendicular to it. This may confuse inexperienced opponents but importantly, if very close to and parallel to the rear wall, makes for a difficult return shot.

The &quot;around the world&quot; or &quot;3 wall&quot; defensive shot is hit like a pinch shot but high on the wall toward the ceiling. It travels around the court in a high trajectory and is an alternative to hitting a ceiling ball.

Two other defensive shots are used but are less effective. If the defensive player is in the backcourt but unable to position himself for a non-defensive shot, he may need to hit the ball off of the back wall. The ball often returns without much force and is easily returned. The round-the-world shot is hit high into the side wall first so the ball then hits the front wall and then the other side wall, effectively circling the court. It can be easily cut off and is rarely used anymore.

== Strategy ==

The primary strategy of racquetball is to command the center of the court just at or behind the dashed receiving line. This allows the player to move as quickly as possible to all areas of the court and limit open court areas which are difficult to defend. After a shot, players should return quickly to center court. The antithesis of this is to be against a wall which severely limits the player&#x27;s movement and allows the opponent an open court.

Important tactics include keeping an eye on the opponent by glancing sideways to anticipate their return shot, learning the typical return shots of the opponent, and attempting to not be predictable with return shots.

Other more obvious strategies are to keep the returned ball as low on the front wall as possible, keeping the ball moving fast (limiting reaction time) and to keep your opponent moving away from center court by the use of lobs, cross court shots, and dinks.

== Major competitions and players ==
Racquetball World Championships

Organized competitive racquetball began in the 1970s. The best male players of that era were Charlie Brumfield and Marty Hogan, as well as Bud Muehleisen, Dan Southern, Jerry Hilecher, Steve Keeley, Davey Bledsoe, Steve Serot, and Steve Strandemo. Hogan continued to be a dominant player into the 1980s, and was rivaled on the scene by Brett Harnett, Dave Peck, and Mike Yellen.

In the 1990s, Ruben Gonzalez, Cliff Swain and Sudsy Monchik dominated pro tournaments, and other great players like Andy Roberts, John Ellis, and Drew Kachtik were often left out of the winner&#x27;s circle. In the 2000s, Kane Waselenchuk, Jack Huczek, Jason Mannino, Ben Croft, and Rocky Carson have all excelled, but Waselenchuk has been dominant the last two seasons losing only once since September 2008.

The first great woman player was Peggy Steding in the 1970s. She was succeeded by Shannon Wright, who was then rivaled by Heather McKay, a great Australian squash player who made the transition to racquetball when living in Canada. McKay then developed a great rivalry with Lynn Adams, and after McKay moved back to Australia, Adams dominated women&#x27;s racquetball for the better part of the 1980s.

The 1990s belonged to Michelle Gould (née Gilman) whose drive serve was a huge weapon against her opponents. In the late 1990s and into the 2000s, Jackie Paraiso and then Cheryl Gudinas were the dominant players. Then in the mid-2000s, Christie Van Hees and Rhonda Rajsich were the dominant players, but Paola Longoria finished #1 at the end of the 2008–2009 and 2009–2010 seasons.

The professional tours have been dominated by two players since the 2010 time frame. On the Men&#x27;s side, Kane Waselenchuk has won 14 year-end #1 titles since 2004, which Paola Longoria has now won 13 year end pro titles dating to 2009, including the last 11 straight.

=== US Open ===

Held annually in October, the US Open is the most prestigious professional racquetball event. First held in 1996, the US Open was in Memphis, Tennessee until 2010, when it moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota. In men&#x27;s play, Kane Waselenchuk (Canada) has won the most US Open titles with thirteen ahead of Sudsy Monchik (US) with four, while Jason Mannino (US) and Cliff Swain (US) have both won the title twice, and Rocky Carson (US) once.

In women&#x27;s play, Paola Longoria (Mexico) has the most US Open titles with five, Rhonda Rajsich (US) has four, one more than Christie Van Hees (Canada) with three. Michelle Gould (US), Cheryl Gudinas (US), and Jackie Paraiso (US) have each won two US Open titles. Kerri Wachtel (US) won the title once.

=== Other championships ===

Racquetball is included in the Pan American Games, World Games and Central American and Caribbean Games. Also, the regional associations of the International Racquetball Federation organize their own continental championships: Asian Championships, European Championships and Pan American Championships.

== Comparison to racketball ==

Racquetball is very similar to the British sport of &#x27;racketball&#x27;, which was patterned on racquetball in 1976. The main differences are that the British ball is smaller, denser, and less bouncy; the British sport&#x27;s court is a squash court, which is substantially shorter and somewhat wider; and the ceiling in the British game is out of bounds.

A racquetball court measures 20 feet wide, 20 feet high and 40 feet long, while a squash court is slightly smaller in height and length than a racquetball court, measuring 21 feet wide, 15 feet high and 32 feet long.

<text>William Paul Thurston (October 30, 1946August 21, 2012) was an American mathematician. He was a pioneer in the field of low-dimensional topology and was awarded the Fields Medal in 1982 for his contributions to the study of 3-manifolds.

Thurston was a professor of mathematics at Princeton University, University of California, Davis, and Cornell University. He was also a director of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute.

== Early life and education ==
William Thurston was born in Washington, D.C., to Margaret Thurston (), a seamstress, and Paul Thurston, an aeronautical engineer. William Thurston suffered from congenital strabismus as a child, causing issues with depth perception. His mother worked with him as a toddler to reconstruct three-dimensional images from two-dimensional ones.

He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from New College in 1967 as part of its inaugural class. For his undergraduate thesis, he developed an intuitionist foundation for topology. Following this, he received a doctorate in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley under Morris Hirsch, with his thesis &quot;Foliations of Three-Manifolds which are Circle Bundles&quot; in 1972.

==Career==
After completing his Ph.D., Thurston spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study, then another year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an assistant professor.

In 1974, Thurston was appointed a full professor at Princeton University. He returned to Berkeley in 1991 to be a professor (1991-1996) and was also director of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) from 1992 to 1997. He was on the faculty at UC Davis from 1996 until 2003, when he moved to Cornell University. 

Thurston was an early adopter of computing in pure mathematics research. He inspired Jeffrey Weeks to develop the SnapPea computing program.

During Thurston&#x27;s directorship at MSRI, the institute introduced several innovative educational programs that have since become standard for research institutes.

His Ph.D. students include Danny Calegari, Richard Canary, David Gabai, William Goldman, Benson Farb, Richard Kenyon, Steven Kerckhoff, Yair Minsky, Igor Rivin, Oded Schramm, Richard Schwartz, William Floyd, and Jeffrey Weeks.

== Research ==
=== Foliations ===

His early work, in the early 1970s, was mainly in foliation theory. His more significant results include:
* The proof that every Haefliger structure on a manifold can be integrated to a foliation (this implies, in particular, that every manifold with zero Euler characteristic admits a foliation of codimension one).
* The construction of a continuous family of smooth, codimension-one foliations on the three-sphere whose Godbillon–Vey invariant (after Claude Godbillon and Jacques Vey) takes every real value.
* With John N. Mather, he gave a proof that the cohomology of the group of homeomorphisms of a manifold is the same whether the group is considered with its discrete topology or its compact-open topology.

In fact, Thurston resolved so many outstanding problems in foliation theory in such a short period of time that it led to an exodus from the field, where advisors counselled students against going into foliation theory, because Thurston was &quot;cleaning out the subject&quot; (see &quot;On Proof and Progress in Mathematics&quot;, especially section 6).

=== The geometrization conjecture ===

His later work, starting around the mid-1970s, revealed that hyperbolic geometry played a far more important role in the general theory of 3-manifolds than was previously realised. Prior to Thurston, there were only a handful of known examples of hyperbolic 3-manifolds of finite volume, such as the Seifert–Weber space. The independent and distinct approaches of Robert Riley and Troels Jørgensen in the mid-to-late 1970s showed that such examples were less atypical than previously believed; in particular their work showed that the figure-eight knot complement was hyperbolic. This was the first example of a hyperbolic knot.

Inspired by their work, Thurston took a different, more explicit means of exhibiting the hyperbolic structure of the figure-eight knot complement. He showed that the figure-eight knot complement could be decomposed as the union of two regular ideal hyperbolic tetrahedra whose hyperbolic structures matched up correctly and gave the hyperbolic structure on the figure-eight knot complement. By utilizing Haken&#x27;s normal surface techniques, he classified the incompressible surfaces in the knot complement. Together with his analysis of deformations of hyperbolic structures, he concluded that all but 10 Dehn surgeries on the figure-eight knot resulted in irreducible, non-Haken non-Seifert-fibered 3-manifolds. These were the first such examples; previously it had been believed that except for certain Seifert fiber spaces, all irreducible 3-manifolds were Haken. These examples were actually hyperbolic and motivated his next theorem.

Thurston proved that in fact most Dehn fillings on a cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold resulted in hyperbolic 3-manifolds. This is his celebrated hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem.

To complete the picture, Thurston proved a hyperbolization theorem for Haken manifolds. A particularly important corollary is that many knots and links are in fact hyperbolic. Together with his hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem, this showed that closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds existed in great abundance.

The hyperbolization theorem for Haken manifolds has been called &quot;Thurston&#x27;s Monster Theorem,&quot; due to the length and difficulty of the proof. Complete proofs were not written up until almost 20 years later. The proof involves a number of deep and original insights which have linked many apparently disparate fields to 3-manifolds.

Thurston was next led to formulate his geometrization conjecture. This gave a conjectural picture of 3-manifolds which indicated that all 3-manifolds admitted a certain kind of geometric decomposition involving eight geometries, now called Thurston model geometries. Hyperbolic geometry is the most prevalent geometry in this picture and also the most complicated. The conjecture was proved by Grigori Perelman in 2002–2003.

=== Density conjecture ===
Thurston and Dennis Sullivan generalized Lipman Bers&#x27; density conjecture from singly degenerate Kleinian surface groups to all finitely generated Kleinian groups in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The conjecture states that every finitely generated Kleinian group is an algebraic limit of geometrically finite Kleinian groups, and was independently proven by Ohshika and Namazi–Souto in 2011 and 2012 respectively.

=== Orbifold theorem ===

In his work on hyperbolic Dehn surgery, Thurston realized that orbifold structures naturally arose. Such structures had been studied prior to Thurston, but his work, particularly the next theorem, would bring them to prominence. In 1981, he announced the orbifold theorem, an extension of his geometrization theorem to the setting of 3-orbifolds. Two teams of mathematicians around 2000 finally finished their efforts to write down a complete proof, based mostly on Thurston&#x27;s lectures given in the early 1980s in Princeton. His original proof relied partly on Richard S. Hamilton&#x27;s work on the Ricci flow.

==Awards and honors==
In 1976, Thurston and James Harris Simons shared the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry.

Thurston received the Fields Medal in 1982 for &quot;revolutioniz[ing] [the] study of topology in 2 and 3 dimensions, showing interplay between analysis, topology, and geometry&quot; and &quot;contribut[ing] [the] idea that a very large class of closed 3-manifolds carry a hyperbolic structure.&quot;

In 2005, Thurston won the first American Mathematical Society Book Prize, for &quot;Three-dimensional Geometry and Topology&quot;.
The prize &quot;recognizes an outstanding research book that makes a seminal contribution to the research literature&quot;. He was awarded the 2012 Leroy P. Steele Prize by the American Mathematical Society for seminal contribution to research. The citation described his work as having &quot;revolutionized 3-manifold theory&quot;.

==Personal life==
Thurston and his first wife, Rachel Findley, had three children: Dylan, Nathaniel, and Emily. Dylan was a MOSP participant (1988–90) and is a mathematician at Indiana University Bloomington. Thurston had two children with his second wife, Julian Muriel Thurston: Hannah Jade and Liam.

Thurston died on August 21, 2012, in Rochester, New York, of a sinus mucosal melanoma that was diagnosed in 2011.

<text>Leisure Suit Larry is an adult-themed sex comedy video game series created by Al Lowe. Drawing inspiration from &quot;Softporn Adventure&quot;, the &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; series centers on Larry Laffer—a middle-aged man known for his balding head, penchant for double entendre, and iconic leisure suits. The stories typically focus on his unsuccessful attempts to seduce young women, portraying him as an unsuccessful pickup artist. A common link between the games are Larry&#x27;s explorations of luxurious and cosmopolitan hotels, ships, beaches, resorts, and casinos.

The series became notable for its blend of humor, parody, and sexual fantasy, a departure from the norm in Sierra&#x27;s otherwise family-friendly catalog. Under Lowe’s creative direction, the franchise launched its first six games between 1987 and 1996, becoming a cult classic. Following a hiatus, the series was revived with new installments overseen by a variety of development teams without Lowe&#x27;s involvement. As of 2011, the series has sold 10 million copies. Sierra co-founder Ken Williams describes Leisure Suit Larry as the company&#x27;s best-known franchise.

==History==
===Original series===

Al Lowe, a designer and programmer on titles like &quot;Donald Duck&#x27;s Playground&quot; and &quot;King&#x27;s Quest III&quot;, sought to innovate by creating a game that blended humor with interactive storytelling. Inspired by the humor in movies and TV, Lowe aimed to prove that games could be funny too. Lowe leveraged the technological advancements established by Adventure Game Interpreter, the engine that behind Sierra&#x27;s successful series, &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; and &quot;Space Quest&quot;, to venture into an untapped commercial niche.

The series originated with &quot;Softporn Adventure&quot;, a 1981 text adventure game by Chuck Benton, published by Sierra. This game&#x27;s plot set the stage for the first &quot;Larry&quot; installment. Al Lowe, reflecting on the game&#x27;s dated feel, likened it to a &#x27;70s leisure suit, a comment that not only influenced the franchise&#x27;s direction but also inspired the creation of its main character, Larry Laffer. Laffer&#x27;s persona was partly based on individuals Lowe encountered while performing as a musician in 1970s bars, where he observed their often-unsuccessful attempts to pick-up women.

Lowe maintained the original&#x27;s structure but rewrote the narrative to include a comedic voice that pokes fun at Larry, significantly altering Softporn&#x27;s tone. This approach retained just one original line, emphasizing Lowe&#x27;s significant reimagining of the game’s narrative voice. Although Chuck Benton, &quot;Softporn&quot;’s creator, is credited in &quot;Larry&quot;, he did not contribute to its development.

The &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; series distinguished itself from other adult-themed games with its focus on comedy over explicit content. Marketed by Sierra as a light-hearted adult adventure, Larry aimed for laughs rather than pure titillation, setting it apart in a landscape populated by titles like &quot;Strip Poker&quot;, &quot;Sex Vixens from Space&quot;, &quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot;, &quot;MacPlaymate&quot; and &quot;Cobra Mission&quot;. At most, the raunchier moments were usually hidden as Easter eggs.

&quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; gained notoriety not just for its adult-themed content but also as a symbol of the rampant issue of software piracy. The scale of piracy was such that, according to Sierra, sales of hint books for the game at one point surpassed the sales of the game itself. Moreover, pirated versions of &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; carried an unexpected threat: computer viruses. Banks in Switzerland, Germany, and England experienced significant data losses after employees, in ill-advised attempts to play pirated versions on work computers, introduced these viruses into their systems.

Recognized as one of 1988&#x27;s best-selling games by the Software Publishers Association, sales of &quot;Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards&quot; surpassed 250,000 copies in its first year. And the first three installments each sold more than their predecessors their initial 90 days of release. However, by the time &quot;Leisure Suit Larry 5: Passionate Patti Does a Little Undercover Work&quot; was released, sales began to plateau. &quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Love for Sail!&quot;, despite critical acclaim and a booming home PC market, only sold around 280,000 copies—a figure below expectations for a mid-90s flagship game, and insufficient to recoup the millions spent on development and manufacturing.

Following its acquisition by CUC International in 1996, Lowe&#x27;s relationship with Sierra underwent significant changes. The adult content of the series became a source of contention within the conglomerate, especially within the conservative business culture of its educational software division, Davidson &amp; Associates. Furthermore, Ken Williams, who had been a fervent supporter of designers with a strong vision for their games, left the company that same year. This departure left Lowe without a key advocate.

In 1998, while &quot;Leisure Suit Larry 8: Lust in Space&quot; was getting underway, Sierra decided to halt production. Subsequent &quot;Larry&quot; games were released without Lowe&#x27;s involvement. Lowe, who was on contract rather than a salaried position at Sierra, did not design any more &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; games.

===Spin-offs and sequels===
&quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude&quot;, a spin-off from the original series, introduced Larry Lovage, Leisure Suit Larry&#x27;s college-aged nephew, as the new protagonist, along with changes in gameplay. It was the first to feature full 3D graphics and to be released on consoles. Developed by High Voltage Software and published by Sierra in 2004, the game received mixed reviews.

In 2008, Sierra Entertainment announced plans to release &quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust&quot;. It was developed by Team17, and the publishing rights were offered to Codemasters, who published the game in 2009. &quot;Box Office Bust&quot; was panned by critics, including Al Lowe himself, who thanked the publisher for keeping him away from developing the game.

Assemble Entertainment released two &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; games, rejuvenating the series with contemporary settings while retaining its humor. &quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Wet Dreams Don&#x27;t Dry&quot; (2018) places Larry in the modern dating world, while its sequel, &quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Wet Dreams Dry Twice&quot; (2020), continues his quest for love.

===Remakes and remasters===

In 1991, Sierra leveraged advancements in technology to support 256-color graphics for the &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; VGA remake. Bill Davis, an Emmy-winning artist and graphic designer, served as the creative director for the Leisure Suit Larry I remake. His choice of a Cubist style challenged conventional video game aesthetics while echoing the series&#x27; humor and cartoon-like nature of Larry&#x27;s universe. The creative process included converting hand-painted backgrounds into digital formats, ensuring they complemented the game’s established aesthetic and the recognizable character design of Larry, previously defined by the series&#x27; box art.

In 2013, &quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded&quot;, a crowdfunded Kickstarter project and the second remake of the original game, was released in collaboration with series creator Al Lowe. While it received mixed to average reviews, critics noted its nostalgic charm but also pointed out that its features and design felt outdated. Lowe discussed the possibility of remaking &quot;Leisure Suit Larry 2&quot; or creating a new sequel, &quot;Leisure Suit Larry 8&quot;. However, both projects were ultimately canceled.

=== Voice acting ===
The CD-ROM version of &quot;Leisure Suit Larry 6: Shape Up or Slip Out!&quot;, which doubled the resolution of the original floppy version, is the first Larry game with voice acting. The character of Larry Laffer was voiced by Jan Rabson. Larry Lovage, the protagonist of &quot;Magna Cum Laude&quot; and &quot;Box Office Bust&quot;, was voiced by Tim Dadabo.

===Unreleased games===
====&quot;Leisure Suit Larry 4: The Missing Floppies&quot;====
&quot;Leisure Suit Larry 4: The Missing Floppies&quot; is the name for a never-made fourth installment, often regarded as an in-joke. The name, used by official sources and fans, refers to rumors that the reason for the cancellation of the game was the losing of the game&#x27;s original production floppy disks, after which the developers refused to remake the game from scratch. Other sources claim that it was nothing but an internal office prank. The franchise&#x27;s installments were numbered as if this installment had been published; the actual fourth installment was &quot;Leisure Suit Larry 5: Passionate Patti Does a Little Undercover Work&quot;.

Al Lowe gave two official reasons for the cancellation of &quot;Leisure Suit Larry 4&quot;. The first was that Sierra had begun work on a multiplayer installment for The Sierra Network, but the project failed mostly due to technical reasons. The second was that the ending of &quot;Larry 3&quot; was definitive and somehow metafictional, since it showed Larry and Patti coming to the Sierra studios to make games based on their adventures, as well as living happily in a mountain cabin in Coarsegold. This completed a relatively cohesive trilogy, and was a dead-end for a new story arc. In 2012, Lowe discussed what happened to the fourth installment in a video made for a Kickstarter project, in which he said that the idea for skipping &quot;Larry 4&quot; came as a flippant comment in the office, and became a &quot;real marketing coup&quot; when selling &quot;Larry 5&quot; because buyers would immediately ask what happened to the fourth. It became &quot;one of software&#x27;s big jokes&quot;.

According to production notes given by Lowe, the following events must be assumed to have happened between &quot;Larry 3&quot; and &quot;Larry 5&quot; to connect the two games: Larry and Patti plan to marry; Patti leaves him at a Yosemite church to pursue her career, but Larry is gone when she returns; the villain of &quot;Larry 5&quot;, Julius Biggs, somehow steals the game disks and Larry suffers amnesia. The absence of the floppy disks was introduced as a plot element in the sequel to explain how Larry, as a computer generated character, came to suffer from amnesia. &quot;Larry 4&quot; appears in several of the other games in the series, including being played in &quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude&quot;. &quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Love For Sale Mobile&quot; takes place during the &quot;Larry 4&quot; development years, and a subplot for the best ending requires finding the lost disks. A folder named LSL4 could be found on the CD of &quot;Leisure Suit Larry Collection&quot; in which Al Lowe left a note in a readme file referencing the game and concluding &quot;who says sequels have to be done sequentially?&quot;.

&quot;MAD Magazine&quot; proposed what &quot;Leisure Suit Larry 4&quot; might have looked like in a 1990 issue spoofing video games. Their idea was &quot;the after effect of Larry&#x27;s screwing around with the time coming for Larry having to pay the piper.&quot; They proposed the idea of Larry in a maze game similar to &quot;Berzerk&quot;, where he must steer clear of out-of-wedlock pregnancies he has caused, as well as private investigators, case workers and angry fathers wielding shotguns, making it extremely difficult for Larry to continue his infamous carefree attitude towards casual sex. On April 1, 2009, the abandonware site Abandonia released an alleged &quot;leaked copy&quot; for download. This turned out in fact to be an elaborate April Fools&#x27; Day prank: the screenshots were fakes, the review was fictional, and the &quot;game&quot; archive actually contained 55 identical copies of scanned front casing of &quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust&quot;.

The game is a part of the plot of &quot;Space Quest 4: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers&quot;, another Sierra title. In the game, LSL4 is labeled as the cause of a supercomputer virus that crippled Roger&#x27;s home planet Xenon.

The fourth part is also considered as the remake of the first game, since it is included in the compilations together with the regular games and was released between the third and fifth part.

====&quot;Leisure Suit Larry 8&quot;====
&quot;Leisure Suit Larry 8&quot;, tentatively subtitled &quot;Lust in Space&quot; (as well as &quot;Explores Uranus&quot; in some references), was in full development in 1998 until funding was cut. Shortly afterwards, Sierra&#x27;s adventure games department was disbanded, and Al Lowe left Sierra on February 22, 1999. Like the canned &quot;Space Quest&quot; sequel, &quot;Larry 8&quot; was to feature 3D computer graphics, but no more than a few test renders now survive. The game &quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Explores Uranus&quot;, as well as its teaser, was referenced in &quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Love for Sail!&quot; triggered with an Easter egg, as well as a teaser after completing the game. In 2013, Al Lowe pointed out that this title is still being considered, with support from series co-writer Josh Mandel. Lowe stated that even though he would like to complete the &quot;Reloaded&quot; series first, &quot;Leisure Suit Larry 8&quot; is &quot;absolutely&quot; still in the works.

====&quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Pocket Party&quot;====
&quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Pocket Party&quot; was a canceled game meant to be released in the second half of 2005 for the N-Gage. The publishers were Vivendi and Nokia, while the developer was TKO-Software. In the game, players would explore a 3D college campus, while solving puzzles and engaging in risque activities. As they search for the ultimate good time, gamers bump into Rosie Palmer, the head cheerleader at Larry&#x27;s college. Attempting to win over Rosie&#x27;s heart, Larry is thoroughly embarrassed by her jock boyfriend Chuck Rockwell, but humiliation has never stopped Larry before and he is determined to do anything to be with Rosie. In addition to singleplayer game play, players could also wirelessly battle an opponent in four different turn-based mini-games. Concept art and design document of the game are in hands of Jody Hicks, one of the game&#x27;s developers. An alpha prototype was spotted at the ObscureGamers forum in February 2021.

====&quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Cocoa Butter&quot;====
In late 2005, Target department stores (through online vendor Amazon.com) began accepting pre-orders for a sequel to &quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude&quot; titled &quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Cocoa Butter&quot;. This new game was being developed for the PC, PS2, Xbox and PSP systems, but has since been canceled.

==Collections==
Several &quot;Larry&quot; collections have been compiled:

==Other software and products==
* &quot;The Official Book of Leisure Suit Larry&quot; (1990) (written by Al Lowe and Ralph Roberts, containing background information and hint guides). The book was revised and edited so that there was a second (1991), a third (1993), and a fourth (1997) edition, and &quot;Special Edition&quot; (released with &quot;Larry Collection&quot;).
* &quot;The Authorized Uncensored Leisure Suit Larry Bedside Companion&quot; (1990) (written by Peter Spear), containing the stories of the first three &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; games, as well as detailed walkthroughs, point lists and maps. The book, like other Sierra books by Peter Spear such as &quot;The King&#x27;s Quest Companion&quot;, was revised and edited so that there was a second edition (1991) covering &quot;Larry 5&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==

The &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; series became one of Sierra&#x27;s most popular during the adventure genre&#x27;s peak. It was ranked as the 85th top game of all time by Next Generation in 1996, praised for its blend of campy humor and bad puns. The total sales of the first five &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; games surpassed 2 million copies by 1996, as of &quot;Love for Sail&quot;″s release. By 1996, following the release of &quot;Love for Sail!&quot;, the first five games had collectively sold over 2 million copies. By 2011, the series had reached a milestone of 10 million copies sold.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; as a &quot;profoundly lonely&quot; representation of American masculinity.

<text>ext2, or second extended file system, is a file system for the Linux kernel. It was initially designed by French software developer Rémy Card as a replacement for the extended file system (ext). Having been designed according to the same principles as the Berkeley Fast File System from BSD, it was the first commercial-grade filesystem for Linux.

The canonical implementation of ext2 is the &quot;ext2fs&quot; filesystem driver in the Linux kernel. Other implementations (of varying quality and completeness) exist in GNU Hurd, MINIX 3, some BSD kernels, in MiNT, Haiku and as third-party Microsoft Windows and macOS (via FUSE) drivers. This driver was deprecated in Linux version 6.9 in favor of the ext4 driver, as the ext4 driver works with ext2 filesystems.

ext2 was the default filesystem in several Linux distributions, including Debian and Red Hat Linux, until supplanted by ext3, which is almost completely compatible with ext2 and is a journaling file system. ext2 is still the filesystem of choice for flash-based storage media (such as SD cards and USB flash drives) because its lack of a journal increases performance and minimizes the number of writes, and flash devices can endure a limited number of write cycles. Since 2009, the Linux kernel supports a journal-less mode of ext4 which provides benefits not found with ext2, such as larger file and volume sizes.

==History==
The early development of the Linux kernel was made as a cross-development under the MINIX operating system. The MINIX file system was used as Linux&#x27;s first file system. The Minix file system was mostly free of bugs, but used 16-bit offsets internally and thus had a maximum size limit of only 64 megabytes, and there was also a filename length limit of 14 characters. Because of these limitations, work began on a replacement native file system for Linux.

To ease the addition of new file systems and provide a generic file API, VFS, a virtual file system layer, was added to the Linux kernel. The extended file system (ext), was released in April 1992 as the first file system using the VFS API and was included in Linux version 0.96c. The ext file system solved the two major problems in the Minix file system (maximum partition size and filename length limitation to 14 characters), and allowed 2 gigabytes of data and filenames of up to 255 characters. But it still had problems: there was no support of separate timestamps for file access, inode modification, and data modification.

As a solution for these problems, two new filesystems were developed in January 1993 for Linux kernel 0.99: xiafs and the second extended file system (ext2), which was an overhaul of the extended file system incorporating many ideas from the Berkeley Fast File System. ext2 was also designed with extensibility in mind, with space left in many of its on-disk data structures for use by future versions. 

Since then, ext2 has been a testbed for many of the new extensions to the VFS API. Features such as the withdrawn POSIX draft ACL proposal and the withdrawn extended attribute proposal were generally implemented first on ext2 because it was relatively simple to extend and its internals were well understood.

On Linux kernels prior to 2.6.17, restrictions in the block driver mean that ext2 filesystems have a maximum file size of 2 TiB.

ext2 is still recommended over journaling file systems on bootable USB flash drives and other solid-state drives. ext2 performs fewer writes than ext3 because there is no journaling. As the major aging factor of a flash chip is the number of erase cycles, and as erase cycles happen frequently on writes, decreasing writes increases the life span of the solid-state device. Another good practice for filesystems on flash devices is the use of the &quot;noatime&quot; mount option, for the same reason.

Beginning with Linux kernel 6.9, the ext2fs driver was deprecated and is no longer enabled in the default configuration. The central reason was that it did not support dates past 2038. Users are recommended to upgrade to ext4.

==ext2 data structures==

The space in ext2 is split up into blocks. These blocks are grouped into block groups, analogous to cylinder groups in the Unix File System. There are typically thousands of blocks on a large file system. Data for any given file is typically contained within a single block group where possible. This is done to minimize the number of disk seeks when reading large amounts of contiguous data.

Each block group contains a copy of the superblock and block group descriptor table, and all block groups contain a block bitmap, an inode bitmap, an inode table, and finally the actual data blocks.

The superblock contains important information that is crucial to the booting of the operating system. Thus backup copies are made in multiple block groups in the file system. However, typically only the first copy of it, which is found at the first block of the file system, is used in the booting.

The group descriptor stores the location of the block bitmap, inode bitmap, and the start of the inode table for every block group. These, in turn, are stored in a group descriptor table.

===Inodes===
Every file or directory is represented by an inode. The term &quot;inode&quot; comes from &quot;index node&quot; (over time, it became i-node and then inode). The inode includes data about the size, permission, ownership, and location on disk of the file or directory.

Example of ext2 inode structure:

Quote from the Linux kernel documentation for ext2:
Thus, there is a structure in ext2 that has 15 pointers. Pointers 1 to 12 point to direct blocks, pointer 13 points to an indirect block, pointer 14 points to a doubly indirect block, and pointer 15 points to a triply indirect block.

===Directories===
Each directory is a list of directory entries. Each directory entry associates one file name with one inode number, and consists of the inode number, the length of the file name, and the actual text of the file name. To find a file, the directory is searched front-to-back for the associated filename. For reasonable directory sizes, this is fine. But for very large directories this is inefficient, and ext3 offers a second way of storing directories (HTree) that is more efficient than just a list of filenames.

The root directory is always stored in inode number two, so that the file system code can find it at mount time. Subdirectories are implemented by storing the name of the subdirectory in the name field, and the inode number of the subdirectory in the inode field. Hard links are implemented by storing the same inode number with more than one file name. Accessing the file by either name results in the same inode number, and therefore the same data.

The special directories &quot;.&quot; (current directory) and &quot;..&quot; (parent directory) are implemented by storing the names &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot; in the directory, and the inode number of the current and parent directories in the inode field. The only special treatment these two entries receive is that they are automatically created when any new directory is made, and they cannot be deleted.

===Allocating data===
When a new file or directory is created, ext2 must decide where to store the data. If the disk is mostly empty, then data can be stored almost anywhere. However, clustering the data with related data will minimize seek times and maximize performance.

ext2 attempts to allocate each new directory in the group containing its parent directory, on the theory that accesses to parent and children directories are likely to be closely related. ext2 also attempts to place files in the same group as their directory entries, because directory accesses often lead to file accesses. However, if the group is full, then the new file or new directory is placed in some other non-full group.

The data blocks needed to store directories and files can be found by looking in the data allocation bitmap. Any needed space in the inode table can be found by looking in the inode allocation bitmap.

==File-system limits==


The reason for some limits of ext2 are the file format of the data and the operating system&#x27;s kernel. Mostly these factors will be determined once when the file system is built. They depend on the block size and the ratio of the number of blocks and inodes.

In Linux the block size is limited by the architecture page size.

There are also some userspace programs that cannot handle files larger than 2 GiB.

If &quot;b&quot; is the block size, the maximal file size is limited to min( ((&quot;b&quot;/4)3 + (&quot;b&quot;/4)2 + &quot;b&quot;/4 + 12) × &quot;b&quot;, (232 − 1) × 512 ) due to the i_block structure (an array of direct/indirect EXT2_N_BLOCKS) and i_blocks (32-bit integer value) representing the number of 1024 byte (1 kilobyte) &quot;blocks&quot; in the file.

The maximal number of sublevel-directories is 31998, due to the link-count limit. Directory indexing is not available in ext2, so there are performance issues for directories with a large number of files (&gt;10,000). The theoretical limit on the number of files in a directory is 1.3 × 1020, although this is not relevant for practical situations.

Note: In Linux 2.4 and earlier, block devices were limited to 2 TiB, limiting the maximal size of a partition, regardless of block size.

==Compression extension==
e2compr is a modification to the ext2 driver in the Linux kernel to support compression and decompression of files by the file system, without any support by user applications. e2compr is a small patch against ext2.

e2compr compresses only regular files; the administrative data (superblock, inodes, directory files, etc.) are not compressed (mainly for safety reasons). Access to compressed blocks is provided for read and write operations. The compression algorithm and cluster size is specified on a per-file basis. Directories can also be marked for compression, in which case every newly created file in the directory will be automatically compressed with the same cluster size and the same algorithm that was specified for the directory.

e2compr is not a new file system. It is only a patch to ext2 made to support the EXT2_COMPR_FL flag. It does not require user to make a new partition, and will continue to read or write existing ext2 file systems. One can consider it as simply a way for the read and write routines to access files that could have been created by a simple utility similar to gzip or compress. Compressed and uncompressed files coexist nicely on ext2 partitions.

The latest e2compr-branch is available for current releases of Linux 2.4, 2.6, and 3.0. The latest patch for Linux 3.0 was released in August 2011 and provides multicore and High memory support. There are also branches for Linux 2.0 and 2.2.

==Under other operating systems==
Access to ext2 partitions under Microsoft Windows is possible through an Installable File System, such as ext2ifs or ext2Fsd. Filesystem in Userspace can be used on macOS.

<text>ext3, or third extended filesystem, is a journaled file system that is commonly used with the Linux kernel. It used to be the default file system for many popular Linux distributions but generally has been supplanted by its successor version ext4. The main advantage of ext3 over its predecessor, ext2, is journaling, which improves reliability and eliminates the need to check the file system after an improper, a.k.a. unclean, shutdown. 

==History==

Stephen Tweedie first revealed that he was working on extending ext2 in &quot;Journaling the Linux ext2fs Filesystem&quot; in a 1998 paper, and later in a February 1999 kernel mailing list posting. The filesystem was merged with the mainline Linux kernel in November 2001 from 2.4.15 onward. 

==Advantages==
The speed performance of ext3 is less attractive than competing Linux filesystems, such as ext4, JFS, ReiserFS, and XFS, but ext3 has a significant advantage in that it allows in-place upgrades from ext2 without having to back up and restore data. Benchmarks suggest that ext3 also uses less CPU power than ReiserFS and XFS. It is also considered safer than the other Linux file systems, due to its relative simplicity and wider testing base.

ext3 adds the following features to ext2:
* A journal
* Online file system growth
* HTree indexing for larger directories

Without these features, any ext3 file system is also a valid ext2 file system. This situation has allowed well-tested and mature file system maintenance utilities for maintaining and repairing ext2 file systems to also be used with ext3 without major changes. The ext2 and ext3 file systems share the same standard set of utilities, e2fsprogs, which includes an fsck tool. The close relationship also makes conversion between the two file systems (both forward to ext3 and backward to ext2) straightforward.

ext3 lacks &quot;modern&quot; filesystem features, such as dynamic inode allocation and extents. This situation might sometimes be a disadvantage, but for recoverability, it is a significant advantage. The file system metadata is all in fixed, well-known locations, and data structures have some redundancy. In significant data corruption, ext2 or ext3 may be recoverable, while a tree-based file system may not.

===Size limits===
The maximum number of blocks for ext3 is 232. The size of a block can vary, affecting the maximum number of files and the maximum size of the file system:

===Journaling levels===
There are three levels of journaling available in the Linux implementation of ext3:

; Journal (lowest risk): Both metadata and file contents are written to the journal before being committed to the main file system. Because the journal is relatively continuous on disk, this can improve performance, if the journal has enough space. In other cases, performance gets worse, because the data must be written twice—once to the journal, and once to the main part of the filesystem.

; Ordered (medium risk): Only metadata is journaled; file contents are not, but it&#x27;s guaranteed that file contents are written to disk before associated metadata is marked as committed in the journal. This is the default on many Linux distributions. If there is a power outage or kernel panic while a file is being written or appended to, the journal will indicate that the new file or appended data has not been &quot;committed&quot;, so it will be purged by the cleanup process. (Thus appends and new files have the same level of integrity protection as the &quot;journaled&quot; level.) However, files being &quot;overwritten&quot; can be corrupted because the original version of the file is not stored. Thus it&#x27;s possible to end up with a file in an intermediate state between new and old, without enough information to restore either one or the other (the new data never made it to disk completely, and the old data is not stored anywhere). Even worse, the intermediate state might intersperse old and new data, because the order of the write is left up to the disk&#x27;s hardware.

; Writeback (highest risk): Only metadata is journaled; file contents are not. The contents might be written before or after the journal is updated. As a result, files modified right before a crash can become corrupted. For example, a file being appended to may be marked in the journal as being larger than it actually is, causing garbage at the end. Older versions of files could also appear unexpectedly after a journal recovery. The lack of synchronization between data and journal is faster in many cases. JFS uses this level of journaling, but ensures that any &quot;garbage&quot; due to unwritten data is zeroed out on reboot. XFS also uses this form of journaling.

In all three modes, the internal structure of file system is assured to be consistent even after a crash. In any case, only the data content of files or directories which were being modified when the system crashed will be affected; the rest will be intact after recovery.

==Disadvantages==

===Functionality===
Because ext3 aims to be backward-compatible with the earlier ext2, many of the on-disk structures are similar to those of ext2. Consequently, ext3 lacks recent features, such as extents, dynamic allocation of inodes, and block sub-allocation. A directory can have at most 31998 &quot;subdirectories&quot;, because an inode can have at most 32,000 links (each direct subdirectory increases their parent folder inode link counter in the &quot;..&quot; reference).

On ext3, like for most current Linux filesystems, the system tool &quot;fsck&quot; should not be used while the filesystem is mounted for writing. Attempting to check a filesystem that is already mounted in read/write mode will (very likely) detect inconsistencies in the filesystem metadata. Where filesystem metadata is changing, and fsck applies changes in an attempt to bring the &quot;inconsistent&quot; metadata into a &quot;consistent&quot; state, the attempt to &quot;fix&quot; the inconsistencies will corrupt the filesystem.

===Defragmentation===

There is no online ext3 defragmentation tool that works on the filesystem level. There is an offline ext2 defragmenter, codice_1. However, codice_1 may destroy data, depending on the feature bits turned on in the filesystem; it does not know how to handle many of the newer ext3 features.

There are userspace defragmentation tools, like Shake and defrag. Shake works by allocating space for the whole file as one operation, which will generally cause the allocator to find contiguous disk space. If there are files which are used at the same time, Shake will try to write them next to one another. Defrag works by copying each file over itself. However, this strategy works only if the file system has enough free space. A true defragmentation tool does not exist for ext3.

However, as the Linux System Administrator Guide states, &quot;Modern Linux filesystem(s) keep fragmentation at a minimum by keeping all blocks in a file close together, even if they can&#x27;t be stored in consecutive sectors. Some filesystems, like ext3, effectively allocate the free block that is nearest to other blocks in a file. Therefore it is not necessary to worry about fragmentation in a Linux system.&quot;

While ext3 is resistant to file fragmentation, ext3 can get fragmented over time or for specific usage patterns, like slowly writing large files. Consequently, ext4 (the successor to ext3) has an online filesystem defragmentation utility e4defrag and currently supports extents (contiguous file regions).

===Undelete===

ext3 does not support the recovery of deleted files. The ext3 driver actively deletes files by wiping file inodes for crash safety reasons.

There are still several techniques and some free and proprietary software for recovery of deleted or lost files using file system journal analysis; however, they do not guarantee any specific file recovery.

===Compression===
e3compr is an unofficial patch for ext3 that does transparent compression. It is a direct port of e2compr and still needs further development. It compiles and boots well with upstream kernels, but journaling is not implemented yet.

===Lack of snapshots support===
Unlike a number of modern file systems, ext3 does not have native support for snapshots, the ability to quickly capture the state of the filesystem at arbitrary times. Instead, it relies on less-space-efficient, volume-level snapshots provided by the Linux LVM. The Next3 file system is a modified version of ext3 which offers snapshots support, yet retains compatibility with the ext3 on-disk format.

===No checksumming in journal===
ext3 does not do checksumming when writing to the journal. On a storage device with extra cache, if &quot;barrier=1&quot; is not enabled as a mount option (in /etc/fstab), and if the hardware is doing out-of-order write caching, one runs the risk of severe filesystem corruption during a crash. This is because storage devices with write caches report to the system that the data has been completely written, even if it was written to the (volatile) cache.

If hard disk writes are done out-of-order (due to modern hard disks caching writes in order to amortize write speeds), it is likely that one will write a commit block of a transaction before the other relevant blocks are written. If a power failure or unrecoverable crash should occur before the other blocks get written, the system will have to be rebooted. Upon reboot, the file system will replay the log as normal, and replay the &quot;winners&quot; (transactions with a commit block, including the invalid transaction above, which happened to be tagged with a valid commit block). The unfinished disk write above will thus proceed, but using corrupt journal data. The file system will thus mistakenly overwrite normal data with corrupt data while replaying the journal. If checksums had been used, where the blocks of the &quot;fake winner&quot; transaction were tagged with a mutual checksum, the file system could have known better and not replayed the corrupt data onto the disk. Journal checksumming has been added to ext4.

Filesystems going through the device mapper interface (including software RAID and LVM implementations) may not support barriers, and will issue a warning if that mount option is used. There are also some disks that do not properly implement the write cache flushing extension necessary for barriers to work, which causes a similar warning. In these situations, where barriers are not supported or practical, reliable write ordering is possible by turning off the disk&#x27;s write cache and using the mount option. Turning off the disk&#x27;s write cache may be required even when barriers are available.

Applications like databases expect a call to fsync() to flush pending writes to disk, and the barrier implementation doesn&#x27;t always clear the drive&#x27;s write cache in response to that call. There is also a potential issue with the barrier implementation related to error handling during events, such as a drive failure. It is also known that sometimes some virtualization technologies do not properly forward fsync or flush commands to the underlying devices (files, volumes, disk) from a guest operating system. Similarly, some hard disks or controllers implement cache flushing incorrectly or not at all, but still advertise that it is supported, and do not return any error when it is used. There are so many ways to handle fsync and write cache handling incorrectly, it is safer to assume that cache flushing does not work unless it is explicitly tested, regardless of how reliable individual components are believed to be.

===Near-time extinction due to date-stamp limitation===
Ext3 stores dates as Unix time using four bytes in the file header. 32 bits does not give enough scope to continue processing files beyond January 18, 2038 - the Year 2038 problem.

==ext4==
On June 28, 2006, Theodore Ts&#x27;o, the principal developer of ext3, announced an enhanced version, called ext4. On October 11, 2008, the patches that mark ext4 as stable code were merged in the Linux 2.6.28 source code repositories, marking the end of the development phase and recommending its adoption.
In 2008, Ts&#x27;o stated that although ext4 has improved features such as being much faster than ext3, it is not a major advancement, it uses old technology, and is a stop-gap; Ts&#x27;o believes that Btrfs is the better direction, because &quot;it offers improvements in scalability, reliability, and ease of management&quot;. Btrfs also has &quot;a number of the same design ideas that reiser3/4 had&quot;.

<doc id="39197" wikidata="Q5172461" url="?curid=39197" title="Corporate haven">
<text>Corporate haven, corporate tax haven, or multinational tax haven is used to describe a jurisdiction that multinational corporations find attractive for establishing subsidiaries or incorporation of regional or main company headquarters, mostly due to favourable tax regimes (not just the headline tax rate), and/or favourable secrecy laws (such as the avoidance of regulations or disclosure of tax schemes), and/or favourable regulatory regimes (such as weak data-protection or employment laws).

Unlike traditional tax havens, modern corporate tax havens reject they have anything to do with near-zero effective tax rates, due to their need to encourage jurisdictions to enter into bilateral tax treaties that accept the haven&#x27;s base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) tools. CORPNET show each corporate tax haven is strongly connected with specific traditional tax havens (via additional BEPS tool &quot;backdoors&quot; like the double Irish, the Dutch sandwich, and single malt). Corporate tax havens promote themselves as &quot;knowledge economies&quot;, and IP as a &quot;new economy&quot; asset, rather than a tax management tool, which is encoded into their statute books as their primary BEPS tool. This perceived respectability encourages corporates to use these IFCs as regional headquarters (i.e. Google, Apple, and Facebook use Ireland in EMEA over Luxembourg, and Singapore in APAC over Hong Kong/Taiwan).

While the &quot;headline&quot; corporate tax rate in jurisdictions most often implicated in BEPS is always above zero (e.g. Netherlands at 25%, U.K. at 19%, Singapore at 17%, and Ireland at 12.5%), the &quot;effective&quot; tax rate (ETR) of multinational corporations, net of the BEPS tools, is closer to zero. To increase respectability, and access to tax treaties, some jurisdictions like Singapore and Ireland require corporates to have a &quot;substantive presence&quot;, equating to an &quot;employment tax&quot; of approximately 2–3% of profits shielded and if these are real jobs, the tax is mitigated.

In corporate tax haven lists, CORPNET&#x27;s &quot;Orbis connections&quot;, ranks the Netherlands, U.K., Switzerland, Ireland, and Singapore as the world&#x27;s key corporate tax havens, while Zucman&#x27;s &quot;quantum of funds&quot; ranks Ireland as the largest global corporate tax haven. In proxy tests, Ireland is the largest recipient of U.S. tax inversions (the U.K. is third, the Netherlands is fifth). Ireland&#x27;s double Irish BEPS tool is credited with the largest build-up of untaxed corporate offshore cash in history. Luxembourg and Hong Kong and the Caribbean &quot;triad&quot; (BVI-Cayman-Bermuda), have elements of corporate tax havens, but also of traditional tax havens.

Economic Substance legislation introduced in recent years has identified that BEPS is not a material part of the financial services business for Cayman, BVI and Bermuda. While the legislation was originally resisted on extraterritoriality, human rights, privacy, international justice, jurisprudence and colonialism grounds, the introduction of these regulations has had the effect of putting these jurisdictions far ahead of onshore regulatory regimes.

==Global BEPS hubs==
Modern corporate tax havens, such as Ireland, Singapore, the Netherlands and the U.K., are different from traditional &quot;offshore&quot; financial centres like Bermuda, the Cayman Islands or Jersey. Corporate havens offer the ability to reroute untaxed profits from higher-tax jurisdictions back to the haven; as long as these jurisdictions have bi-lateral tax treaties with the corporate haven. This makes modern corporate tax havens more potent than more traditional tax havens, who have more limited tax treaties, due to their acknowledged status. 

The Cayman Islands, BVI, Bermuda, Jersey and Guernsey are more properly now known as IFCs or OFCs. 

===Tools===

Tax academics identify that extracting untaxed profits from higher-tax jurisdictions requires several components:

Once the untaxed funds are rerouted back to the corporate tax haven, additional BEPS tools shield against paying taxes in the haven. It is important these BEPS tools are complex and obtuse so that the higher-tax jurisdictions do not feel the corporate haven is a traditional tax haven (or they will suspend the bilateral tax treaties). These complex BEPS tools often have interesting labels:
===Execution===

Building the tools requires advanced legal and accounting skills that can create the BEPS tools in a manner that is acceptable to major global jurisdictions and that can be encoded into bilateral tax treaties, and does not look like a &quot;tax haven&quot; type activity. Most modern corporate tax havens therefore come from established financial centres where advanced skills are in-situ for financial structuring. In addition to being able to create the tools, the haven needs the respectability to use them. Large high-tax jurisdictions like Germany do not accept IP–based BEPS tools from Bermuda but do from Ireland. Similarly, Australia accepts limited IP–based BEPS tools from Hong Kong but accepts the full range from Singapore. 

Tax academics identify a number of elements corporate havens employ in supporting respectability:
==Aspects==

===Misnomer===

Whereas jurisdictions traditionally labelled as tax havens have often marketed themselves as such, modern Offshore Financial Centres robustly refute the tax haven label. This is to ensure that other higher-tax jurisdictions, from which the corporate&#x27;s main income and profits often derive, will sign bilateral tax-treaties with the haven, and also to avoid being black-listed.

This issue has caused debate on what constitutes a tax haven, with the OECD most focused on transparency (the key issue of traditional tax havens), but others focused on outcomes such as total effective corporate taxes paid. It is common to see the media, and elected representatives, of a modern corporate tax haven ask the question, &quot;Are we a tax haven ?&quot;

For example, when it was shown in 2014, prompted by an October 2013 Bloomberg piece, that the effective tax rate of U.S. multinationals in Ireland was 2.2% (using the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis method), it led to denials by the Irish Government and the production of studies claiming Ireland&#x27;s effective tax rate was 12.5%. However, when the EU fined Apple in 2016, Ireland&#x27;s largest company, €13 billion in Irish back taxes (the largest tax fine in corporate history), the EU stated that Apple&#x27;s effective tax rate in Ireland was approximately 0.005% for the 2004-2014 period. The EU&#x27;s position was found, on appeal in the EU&#x27;s court, to be unsupported by the facts. However, the G7 leaders in the wake of reporting about a Microsoft subsidiary&#x27;s level of taxation in 2020, have proposed an agreement on a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. 
Activists in the Tax Justice Network propose that Ireland&#x27;s effective corporate tax rate was not 12.5%, but closer to the BEA calculation. Studies cited by &quot;The Irish Times&quot; and other outlets suggest that the effective tax rate is close to the headline 12.5 percent rate – but this is a theoretical result based on a theoretical &quot;standard firm with 60 employees&quot; and no exports: in reality, multinational businesses and their corporate structures vary significantly. It is not just Ireland, however. The same BEA calculation showed that the ETRs of U.S. corporates in other jurisdictions was also very low: Luxembourg (2.4%), the Netherlands (3.4%) and the US for multinationals based in other parts of the World. When Gabriel Zucman, published a multi-year investigation into corporate tax havens in June 2018, showing that Ireland is the largest global corporate tax haven (having allegedly shielded $106 billion in profits in 2015), and that Ireland&#x27;s effective tax rate was 4% (including all non-Irish corporates), the Irish Government countered that they could not be a tax haven as they are OECD-compliant.

===Financial impact===
It is difficult to calculate the financial effect of tax havens in general due to the obfuscation of financial data. Most estimates have wide ranges (see financial effect of tax havens). By focusing on &quot;headline&quot; vs. &quot;effective&quot; corporate tax rates, researchers have been able to more accurately estimate the annual financial tax losses (or &quot;profits shifted&quot;), due to corporate tax havens specifically. This is not easy, however. As discussed above, havens are sensitive to discussions on &quot;effective&quot; corporate tax rates and obfuscate data that does not show the &quot;headline&quot; tax rate mirroring the &quot;effective&quot; tax rate.

Two academic groups have estimated the &quot;effective&quot; tax rates of corporate tax havens using very different approaches:
They are summarised in the following table (BVI and the Caymans counted as one), as listed in Zucman&#x27;s analysis (from Appendix, table 2).

Zucman used this analysis to estimate that the annual financial impact of corporate tax havens was $250 billion in 2015. This is beyond the upper limit of the OECD&#x27;s 2017 range of $100–200 billion per annum for base erosion and profit shifting activities.

The World Bank, in its 2019 World Development Report on the future of work suggests that tax avoidance by large corporations limits the ability of governments to make vital human capital investments.

===Conduits and Sinks===

Modern corporate tax havens like Ireland, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have become more popular for U.S. corporate tax inversions than leading traditional tax havens, even Bermuda. 

However, corporate tax havens still retain close connections with traditional tax havens as there are instances where a corporation cannot &quot;retain&quot; the untaxed funds in the corporate tax haven, and will instead use the corporate tax haven like a &quot;conduit&quot;, to route the funds to more explicitly zero-tax, and more secretive traditional tax havens. Google does this with the Netherlands to route EU funds untaxed to Bermuda (i.e. dutch sandwich to avoid EU withholding taxes), and Russian banks do this with Ireland to avoid international sanctions and access capital markets (i.e. Irish Section 110 SPVs).

A study published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 2017 (see Conduit and Sink OFCs), highlighted an emerging gap between corporation tax haven specialists (called Conduit OFCs), and more traditional tax havens (called Sink OFCs). It also highlighted that each Conduit OFC was highly connected to specific Sink . For example, Conduit OFC Switzerland was highly tied to Sink OFC Jersey. Conduit OFC Ireland was tied to Sink OFC Luxembourg, while Conduit OFC Singapore was connected to Sink OFCs Taiwan and Hong Kong (the study clarified that Luxembourg and Hong Kong were more like traditional tax havens).

The separation of tax havens into Conduit OFCs and Sink OFCs, enables the corporate tax haven specialist to promote &quot;respectability&quot; and maintain OECD-compliance (critical to extracting untaxed profits from higher-taxed jurisdictions via cross-border intergroup IP charging), while enabling the corporate to still access the benefits of a full tax haven (via double Irish, dutch sandwich type BEPS tools), as needed.

We increasingly find offshore magic circle law firms, such as Maples and Calder and Appleby, setting up offices in major Conduit OFCs, such as Ireland.

===Employment tax===

Several modern corporate tax havens, such as Singapore and the United Kingdom, ask that in return for corporates using their IP-based BEPS tools, they must perform &quot;work&quot; on the IP in the jurisdiction of the haven. The corporation thus pays an effective &quot;employment tax&quot; of circa 2–3% by having to hire staff in the corporate tax haven. This gives the haven more respectability (i.e. not a &quot;brass plate&quot; location), and gives the corporate additional &quot;substance&quot; against challenges by taxing authorities. The OECD&#x27;s Article 5 of the MLI supports havens with &quot;employment taxes&quot; at the expense of traditional tax havens.

Irish IP-based BEPS tools (e.g. the &quot;capital allowances for intangible assets&quot; BEPS scheme), have the need to perform a &quot;relevant trade&quot; and &quot;relevant activities&quot; on Irish-based IP, encoded in their legislation, which requires specified employment levels and salary levels (discussed here), which roughly equates to an &quot;employment tax&quot; of circa 2–3% of profits (based on Apple and Google in Ireland).

For example, Apple employs 6,000 people in Ireland, mostly in the Apple Hollyhill Cork plant. The Cork plant is Apple&#x27;s only self-operated manufacturing plant in the world (i.e. Apple almost always contracts to 3rd party manufacturers). It is considered a low-technology facility, building iMacs to order by hand, and in this regard is more akin to a global logistics hub for Apple (albeit located on the &quot;island&quot; of Ireland). No research is carried out in the facility. Unusually for a plant, over 700 of the 6,000 employees work from home (the largest remote percentage of any Irish technology company).

When the EU Commission completed their State aid investigation into Apple, they found Apple Ireland&#x27;s ETR for 2004–2014, was 0.005%, on over €100bn of globally sourced, and untaxed, profits. The &quot;employment tax&quot; is, therefore, a modest price to pay for achieving very low taxes on global profits, and it can be mitigated to the extent that the job functions are real and would be needed regardless.

&quot;Employment taxes&quot; are considered a distinction between modern corporate tax havens, and near-corporate tax havens, like Luxembourg and Hong Kong (who are classed as Sink OFCs). The Netherlands has been introducing new &quot;employment tax&quot; type regulations, to ensure it is seen as a modern corporate tax haven (more like Ireland, Singapore, and the U.K.), than a traditional tax haven (e.g. Hong Kong).

===U.K. transformation===

The United Kingdom was traditionally a &quot;donor&quot; to corporate tax havens (e.g. the last one being Shire plc&#x27;s tax inversion to Ireland in 2008). However, the speed at which the U.K. changed to becoming one of the leading modern corporate tax havens (at least up until pre-Brexit), makes it an interesting case (it still does not appear on all ).

The U.K. changed its tax regime in 2009–2013. It lowered its corporate tax rate to 19%, brought in new IP-based BEPS tools, and moved to a territorial tax system. The U.K. became a &quot;recipient&quot; of U.S. corporate tax inversions, and ranked as one of Europe&#x27;s leading havens. A major study now ranks the U.K. as the second largest global Conduit OFC (a corporate haven proxy). The U.K. was particularly fortunate as 18 of the 24 jurisdictions that are identified as Sink OFCs, the traditional tax havens, are current or past dependencies of the U.K. (and embedded into U.K. tax and legal statute books).

New IP legislation was encoded into the U.K. statute books and the concept of IP significantly broadened in U.K. law. The U.K.&#x27;s Patent Office was overhauled and renamed the Intellectual Property Office. A new U.K. Minister for Intellectual Property was announced with the 2014 Intellectual Property Act. The U.K. is now 2nd in the 2018 Global IP Index.

The U.K.&#x27;s successful transformation from &quot;donor&quot; to corporate tax havens, to a major global corporate tax haven in its own right, was quoted as a blueprint for type of changes that the U.S. needed to make in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 tax reforms (e.g. territorial system, lower headline rate, beneficial IP-rate).

===Distorted GDP/GNP===

Some leading modern corporate tax havens are synonymous with offshore financial centres (or OFCs), as the scale of the multinational flows rivals their own domestic economies (the IMF&#x27;s sign of an OFC). The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland estimated that the value of U.S. investment in Ireland was €334bn, exceeding Irish GDP (€291bn in 2016). An extreme example was Apple&#x27;s &quot;onshoring&quot; of circa $300 billion in intellectual property to Ireland, creating the leprechaun economics affair. However Luxembourg&#x27;s GNI is only 70% of GDP. The distortion of Ireland&#x27;s economic data from corporates using Irish IP-based BEPS tools (especially the capital allowances for intangible assets tool), is so great, that it distorts EU-28 aggregate data.

This distortion means that all corporate tax havens, and particularly smaller ones like Ireland, Singapore, Luxembourg and Hong Kong, rank at the top in global GDP-per-capita league tables. In fact, not being a county with oil &amp; gas resources and still ranking in the top 10 of world GDP-per-capita league tables, is considered a strong proxy sign of a corporate (or traditional) tax haven. GDP-per-capita tables with identification of haven types are here .

Ireland&#x27;s distorted economic statistics, post leprechaun economics and the introduction of modified GNI, is captured on page 34 of the OECD 2018 Ireland survey:
This distortion leads to exaggerated credit cycles. The artificial/distorted &quot;headline&quot; GDP growth increases optimism and borrowing in the haven, which is financed by global capital markets (who are misled by the artificial/distorted &quot;headline&quot; GDP figures and misprice the capital provided). The resulting bubble in asset/property prices from the build-up in credit can unwind quickly if global capital markets withdraw the supply of capital. Extreme credit cycles have been seen in several of the corporate tax havens (i.e. Ireland in 2009-2012 is an example). Traditional tax havens like Jersey have also experienced this.

==Intellectual-property–based BEPS tools==

===Raw materials of tax avoidance===

Whereas traditional corporate tax havens facilitated avoiding domestic taxes (e.g. U.S. corporate tax inversion), modern corporate tax havens provide base erosion and profit shifting (or BEPS) tools, which facilitate avoiding taxes in all global jurisdictions in which the corporation operates. This is as long as the corporate tax haven has tax-treaties with the jurisdictions that accept &quot;royalty payment&quot; schemes (i.e. how the IP is charged out), as a deduction against tax. A crude indicator of a corporate tax haven is the amount of full bilateral tax treaties that it has signed. The U.K. is the leader with over 122, followed by the Netherlands with over 100.

BEPS tools abuse intellectual property (or IP), GAAP accounting techniques, to create artificial internal intangible assets, which facilitate BEPS actions, via:

IP is described as the &quot;raw material&quot; of tax planning. Modern corporate tax havens have IP-based BEPS tools, and are in all their bilateral tax-treaties. IP is a powerful tax management and BEPS tool, with almost no other equal, for four reasons:

When corporate tax havens quote &quot;effective rates of tax&quot;, they exclude large amounts of income not considered taxable due to the IP-based tools. Thus, in a self-fulfilling manner, their &quot;effective&quot; tax rates equal their &quot;headline&quot; tax rates. As discussed earlier (), Ireland claims an &quot;effective&quot; tax rate of circa 12.5%, while the IP-based BEPS tools used by Ireland&#x27;s largest companies, mostly U.S. multinationals, are marketed with effective tax rates of &lt;0-3%. These 0-3% rates have been verified in the EU Commission&#x27;s investigation of Apple (see above), and other sources.

===Encoding IP–based BEPS tools===

The creation of IP-based BEPS tools requires advanced legal and tax structuring capabilities, as well as a regulatory regime willing to carefully encode the complex legislation into the jurisdiction&#x27;s statute books (note that BEPS tools bring increased risks of tax abuse by the domestic tax base in corporate tax haven&#x27;s own jurisdiction, see for an example). Modern corporate tax havens, therefore, tend to have large global legal and accounting professional service firms in-situ (many classical tax havens lack this) who work with the government to build the legislation. In this regard, havens are accused of being captured states by their professional services firms. The close relationship between Ireland&#x27;s International Financial Services Centre professional service firms and the State in Ireland, is often described as the &quot;green jersey agenda&quot;. The speed at which Ireland was able to replace its double Irish IP-based BEPS tool, is a noted example.

It is considered that this type of legal and tax work is beyond the normal trust-structuring of offshore magic circle-type firms. This is substantive and complex legislation that needs to integrate with tax treaties that involve G20 jurisdictions, as well as advanced accounting concepts that will meet U.S. GAAP, SEC and IRS regulations (U.S. multinationals are leading users of IP-based BEPS tools). It is also why most modern corporate tax havens started as financial centres, where a critical mass of advanced professional services firms develop around complex financial structuring (almost half of the main 10 corporate tax havens are in the 2017 top 10 Global Financial Centres Index, see ).

The EU Commission has been trying to break the close relationship in the main EU corporate tax havens (i.e. Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus; the main Conduit and Sink OFCs in the EU-28, post Brexit), between law and accounting advisory firms, and their regulatory authorities (including taxing and statistical authorities) from a number of approaches:
===The &quot;Knowledge Economy&quot;===

Modern corporate havens present IP-based BEPS tools as &quot;innovation economy&quot;, &quot;new economy&quot; or &quot;knowledge economy&quot; business activities (e.g. some use the term &quot;knowledge box&quot; or &quot;patent box&quot; for a class of IP-based BEPS tools, such as in Ireland and in the U.K.), however, their development as a GAAP accounting entry, with few exceptions, is for the purposes of tax management. A lawyer said &quot;Intellectual property (IP) has become the leading tax-avoidance vehicle.&quot;

When Apple &quot;onshored&quot; $300 billion of IP to Ireland in 2015 (leprechaun economics), the Irish Central Statistics Office suppressed its regular data release to protect the identity of Apple (unverifiable for 3 years, until 2018), but then described the artificial 26.3% rise in Irish GDP as &quot;meeting the challenges of a modern globalised economy&quot;. The behaviour of the CSO was described as putting on the &quot;green jersey&quot;. Leprechaun economics an example of how Ireland was able to meet with the OECD&#x27;s transparency requirements (and score well in the Financial Secrecy Index), and still hide the largest BEPS action in history.

As noted earlier (), the U.K. has a Minister for Intellectual Property and an Intellectual Property Office, as does Singapore (Intellectual Property Office of Singapore). The top 10 list of the 2018 Global Intellectual Property Center IP Index, the leaders in IP management, features the five largest modern corporate tax havens: United Kingdom (#2), Ireland (#6), the Netherlands (#7), Singapore (#9) and Switzerland (#10). This is despite the fact that patent-protection has traditionally been synonymous with the largest, and longest established, legal jurisdictions (i.e. mainly older G7-type countries).

===German &quot;Royalty Barrier&quot; failure===

In June 2017, the German Federal Council approved a new law called an IP &quot;Royalty Barrier&quot; (Lizenzschranke) that restricts the ability of corporates to deduct intergroup cross-border IP charges against German taxation (and also encourage corporates to allocate more employees to Germany to maximise German tax-relief). The law also enforces a minum &quot;effective&quot; 25% tax rate on IP. While there was initial concern amongst global corporate tax advisors (who encode the IP legislation) that a &quot;Royalty Barrier&quot; was the &quot;beginning of the end&quot; for IP-based BEPS tools, the final law was instead a boost for modern corporate tax havens, whose OECD-compliant, and more carefully encoded and embedded IP tax regimes, are effectively exempted. More traditional corporate tax havens, which do not always have the level of sophistication and skill in encoding IP BEPS tools into their tax regimes, will fall further behind.

The German &quot;Royalty Barrier&quot; law exempts IP charged from locations which have:
One of Ireland&#x27;s main tax law firms, Matheson, whose clients include some of the largest U.S. multinationals in Ireland, issued a note to its clients confirming that the new German &quot;Royalty Barrier&quot; will have little effect on their Irish IP-based BEPS structures - despite them being the primary target of the law. In fact, Matheson notes that that new law will further highlight Ireland&#x27;s &quot;robust solution&quot;.

The failure of the German &quot;Royalty Barrier&quot; approach is a familiar route for systems that attempt to curb corporate tax havens via an OECD-compliance type approach (see ), which is what modern corporate tax havens are distinctive in maintaining. It contrasts with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (see ), which ignores whether a jurisdiction is OECD compliant (or not), and instead focuses solely on &quot;effective taxes paid&quot;, as its metric. Had the German &quot;Royalty Barrier&quot; taken the U.S. approach, it would have been more onerous for havens. Reasons for why the barrier was designed to fail is discussed in complex agendas.

===IP and post-tax margins===

The sectors most associated with IP (e.g., technology and life sciences) are generally some of the most profitable corporate sectors in the world. By using IP-based BEPS tools, these profitable sectors have become even more profitable on an after-tax basis by artificially suppressing profitability in higher-tax jurisdictions, and profit shifting to low-tax locations.

For example, Google Germany should be even more profitable than the already very profitable Google U.S. This is because the marginal additional costs for firms like Google U.S. of expanding into Germany are very low (the core technology platform has been built). In practice, however, Google Germany is actually unprofitable (for tax purposes), as it pays intergroup IP charges back to Google Ireland, who reroutes them to Google Bermuda, who is extremely profitable (more so than Google U.S.). These intergroup IP charges (i.e. the IP-based BEPS tools), are artificial internal constructs.

Commentators have linked the cyclical peak in U.S. corporate profit margins, with the enhanced after-tax profitability of the biggest U.S. technology firms.

For example, the definitions of IP in corporate tax havens such as Ireland has been broadened to include &quot;theoretical assets&quot;, such as types of general rights, general know-how, general goodwill, and the right to use software. Ireland&#x27;s IP regime includes types of &quot;internally developed&quot; intangible assets and intangible assets purchased from &quot;connected parties&quot;. The real control in Ireland is that the IP assets must be acceptable under GAAP (older 2004 Irish GAAP is accepted), and thus auditable by an Irish International Financial Services Centre accounting firm.

A broadening range of multinationals are abusing IP accounting to increase after-tax margins, via intergroup charge-outs of artificial IP assets for BEPS purposes, including:
It has been noted that IP-based BEPS tools such as the &quot;patent box&quot; can be structured to create negative rates of taxation for IP-heavy corporates.

==IP–based Tax inversions==

===Apple vs. Pfizer–Allergan===

Modern corporate tax havens further leverage their IP-based BEPS toolbox to enable international corporates to execute quasi-tax inversions, which could otherwise be blocked by domestic anti-inversion rules. The largest example was Apple&#x27;s Q1 January 2015 restructuring of its Irish business, Apple Sales International, in a quasi-tax inversion, which led to the Paul Krugman labeled &quot;leprechaun economics&quot; affair in Ireland in July 2016 (see article).

In early 2016, the Obama Administration blocked the proposed $160 billion Pfizer-Allergan Irish corporate tax inversion, the largest proposed corporate tax inversion in history, a decision which the Trump Administration also upheld.

However, both Administrations were silent when the Irish State announced in July 2016 that 2015 GDP has risen 26.3% in one quarter due to the &quot;onshoring&quot; of corporate IP, and it was rumoured to be Apple. It might have been due to the fact that the Central Statistics Office (Ireland) openly delayed and limited its normal data release to protect the confidentiality of the source of the growth. It was only in early 2018, almost three years after Apple&#x27;s Q1 2015 $300 billion quasi-tax inversion to Ireland (the largest tax inversion in history), that enough Central Statistics Office (Ireland) data was released to prove it definitively was Apple.

Financial commentators estimate Apple onshored circa $300 billion in IP to Ireland, effectively representing the balance sheet of Apple&#x27;s non-U.S. business. Thus, Apple completed a quasi-inversion of its non-U.S. business, to itself, in Ireland, which was almost twice the scale of Pfizer-Allergan&#x27;s $160 billion blocked inversion.

===Apple&#x27;s IP–based BEPS inversion===

Apple used Ireland&#x27;s new BEPS tool, and &quot;double Irish&quot; replacement, the &quot;capital allowances for intangible assets&quot; scheme. This BEPS tool enables corporates to write-off the &quot;arm&#x27;s length&quot; (to be OECD-compliant), intergroup acquisition of offshored IP, against all Irish corporate taxes. The &quot;arm&#x27;s length&quot; criteria are achieved by getting a major accounting firm in Ireland&#x27;s International Financial Services Centre to conduct a valuation, and Irish GAAP audit, of the IP. The range of IP acceptable by the Irish Revenue Commissioners is very broad. This BEPS tool can be continually replenished by acquiring new offshore IP with each new &quot;product cycle&quot;.

In addition, Ireland&#x27;s 2015 Finance Act removed the 80% cap on this tool (which forced a minimum 2.5% effective tax rate), thus giving Apple a 0% effective tax rate on the &quot;onshored&quot; IP. Ireland then restored the 80% cap in 2016 (and a return to a minimum 2.5% effective tax rate), but only for new schemes.

Thus, Apple was able to achieve what Pfizer-Allergan could not, by making use of Ireland&#x27;s advanced IP-based BEPS tools. Apple avoided any U.S regulatory scrutiny/blocking of its actions, as well as any wider U.S. public outcry, as Pfizer-Allergan incurred. Apple structured an Irish corporate effective tax rate of close to zero on its non-U.S. business, at twice the scale of the Pfizer-Allergan inversion.

==Debt–based BEPS tools==
===Dutch &quot;Double Dip&quot;===

While the focus of corporate tax havens continues to be on developing new IP-based BEPS tools (such as OECD-compliant knowledge/patent boxes), Ireland has developed new BEPS tools leveraging traditional securitisation SPVs, called Section 110 SPVs. Use of intercompany loans and loan interest was one of the original BEPS tools and was used in many of the early U.S. corporate tax inversions (was known as &quot;earnings-stripping&quot;).

The Netherlands has been a leader in this area, using specifically worded legislation to enable IP-light companies further amplify &quot;earnings-stripping&quot;. This is used by mining and resource extraction companies, who have little or no IP, but who use high levels of leverage and asset financing. Dutch tax law enables IP-light companies to &quot;overcharge&quot; their subsidiaries for asset financing (i.e. reroute all untaxed profits back to the Netherlands), which is treated as tax-free in the Netherlands. The technique of getting full tax-relief for an artificially high-interest rate in a foreign subsidiary, while getting additional tax relief on this income back home in the Netherlands, became known by the term, &quot;double dipping&quot;. As with the Dutch sandwich, ex. Dutch Minister Joop Wijn is credited as its creator.

===Irish Section 110 SPV===
The Irish Section 110 SPV uses complex securitisation loan structuring (including &quot;orphaning&quot; which adds confidentiality), to enable the profit shifting. This tool is so powerful, it inadvertently enabled US distressed debt funds avoid billions in Irish taxes on circa €80 billion of Irish investments they made in 2012-2016 (see Section 110 abuse). This was despite the fact that the seller of the circa €80 billion was mostly the Irish State&#x27;s own National Asset Management Agency.

The global securitisation market is circa $10 trillion in size, and involves an array of complex financial loan instruments, structured on assets all over the world, using established securitization vehicles that are accepted globally (and whitelisted by the OECD). This is also helpful for concealing corporate BEPS activities, as demonstrated by sanctioned Russian banks using Irish Section 110 SPVs.

This area is therefore an important new BEPS tool for EU corporate tax havens, Ireland and Luxembourg, who are also the EU&#x27;s leading securitisation hubs. Particularly so, given the new anti-IP-based BEPS tool taxes of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), (i.e. the new GILTI tax regime and BEAT tax regime), and proposed EU Digital Services Tax (DST) regimes.

The U.S. TCJA anticipates a return to debt-based BEPS tools, as it limits interest deductibility to 30% of EBITDA (moving to 30% of EBIT post 2021).

While securitisation SPVs are important new BEPS tools, and acceptable under global tax-treaties, they suffer from &quot;substance&quot; tests (i.e. challenges by tax authorities that the loans are artificial). Irish Section 110 SPV&#x27;s use of &quot;Profit Participation Notes&quot; (i.e. artificial internal intergroup loans), is an impediment to corporates using these structures versus established IP-based BEPS tools. Solutions such as the Orphaned Super-QIAIF have been created in the Irish tax code to resolve this.

However, while Debt-based BEPS tools may not feature with U.S. multinational technology companies, they have become attractive to global financial institutions (who do not need to meet the same &quot;substance&quot; tests on their financial transactions).

In February 2018, the Central Bank of Ireland upgraded the little-used Irish L-QIAIF regime to offer the same tax benefits as Section 110 SPVs but without the need for Profit Participation Notes and without the need to file public accounts with the Irish CRO (which had exposed the scale of Irish domestic taxes Section 110 SPVs had been used to avoid, see abuses).

==Ranking corporate tax havens==

===Proxy tests===
The study and identification of modern corporate tax havens are still developing. Traditional qualitative-driven IMF-OCED-Financial Secrecy Index type tax haven screens, which focus on assessing legal and tax structures, are less effective given the high levels of transparency and OECD-compliance in modern corporate tax havens (i.e. most of their BEPS tools are OECD-whitelisted).
===Quantitative measures===
More scientific, are the quantitative-driven studies (focused on empirical outcomes), such as the work by the University of Amsterdam&#x27;s CORPNET in Conduit and Sink OFCs, and by University of Berkley&#x27;s Gabriel Zucman. They highlight the following modern corporate tax havens, also called Conduit OFCs, and also highlight their &quot;partnerships&quot; with key traditional tax havens, called Sink OFCs:
The only jurisdiction from the above list of major global corporate tax havens that makes an occasional appearance in OECD-IMF tax haven lists is Switzerland. These jurisdictions are the leaders in IP-based BEPS tools and use of intergroup IP charging and have the most sophisticated IP legislation. They have the largest tax treaty networks and all follow the approach.

The analysis highlights the difference between &quot;suspected&quot; onshore tax havens (i.e. major Sink OFCs Luxembourg and Hong Kong), which because of their suspicion, have limited/restricted bilateral tax treaties (as countries are wary of them), and the Conduit OFCs, which have less &quot;suspicion&quot; and therefore the most extensive bilateral tax treaties. Corporates need the broadest tax treaties for their BEPS tools, and therefore prefer to base themselves in Conduit OFCs (Ireland and Singapore), which can then route the corporate&#x27;s funds to the Sink OFCs (Luxembourg and Hong Kong).

Of the major Sink OFCs, they span a range between traditional tax havens (with very limited tax treaty networks) and near-corporate tax havens:
The above five corporate tax haven Conduit OFCs, plus the three general tax haven Sink OFCs (counting the Caribbean &quot;triad&quot; as one major Sink OFC), are replicated at the top 8-10 corporate tax havens of many independent lists, including the Oxfam list, and the ITEP list. (see ).

===Ireland as global leader===

Gabriel Zucman&#x27;s analysis differs from most other works in that it focuses on the total quantum of taxes shielded. He shows that many of Ireland&#x27;s U.S. multinationals, like Facebook, do not appear on Orbis (the source for quantitative studies, including CORPNET&#x27;s) or have a small fraction of their data on Orbis (Google and Apple).

Analysed using a &quot;quantum of funds&quot; method (not an &quot;Orbis corporate connections&quot; method), Zucman shows Ireland as the largest EU-28 corporate tax haven, and the major route for Zucman&#x27;s estimated annual loss of 20% in EU-28 corporate tax revenues. Ireland exceeds the Netherlands in terms of &quot;quantum&quot; of taxes shielded, which would arguably make Ireland the largest global corporate tax haven (it even matches the combined Caribbean triad of Bermuda-British Virgin Islands-the Cayman Islands). See .

==Failure of OECD BEPS Project==
===Reasons for the failure===

The rise of modern corporate tax havens, like the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland and Singapore, contrasts with the failure of OECD initiatives to combat global corporate tax avoidance and BEPS activities. There are many reasons advocated for the OECD&#x27;s failure, the most common being:

It has been noted in the OECD&#x27;s defence, that G8 economies like the U.S. were strong supporters of the OECD&#x27;s IP work, as they saw it as a tool for their domestic corporates (especially IP-heavy technology and life sciences firms), to charge-out US-based IP to international markets and thus, under U.S. bilateral tax treaties, remit untaxed profits back to the U.S. However, when U.S. multinationals perfected these IP-based BEPS tools and worked out how to relocate them to zero-tax places such as the Caribbean or Ireland, the U.S. became less supportive (i.e. U.S. 2013 Senate investigation into Apple in Bermuda).

However, the U.S. lost further control when corporate havens such as Ireland, developed &quot;closed-loop&quot; IP-based BEPS systems, like the capital allowances for intangibles tool, which by-pass U.S. anti-Corporate tax inversion controls, to enable any U.S. firm (even IP-light firms) create a synthetic corporate tax inversion (and achieve 0-3% Irish effective tax rates), without ever leaving the U.S. Apple&#x27;s successful $300 Q1 2015 billion IP-based Irish tax inversion (which came to be known as leprechaun economics), compares with the blocked $160 billion Pfizer-Allergan Irish tax inversion.

The &quot;closed-loop&quot; element refers to the fact that the creation of the artificial internal intangible asset (which is critical to the BEPS tool), can be done within the confines of the Irish-office of a global accounting firm, and an Irish law firm, as well as the Irish Revenue Commissioners. No outside consent is needed to execute the BEPS tool (and use via Ireland&#x27;s global tax-treaties), save for two situations:
===Departure of U.S. and EU===

The 2017-18 U.S. and EU Commission taxation initiatives, deliberately depart from the OECD BEPS Project, and have their own explicit anti-IP BEPS tax regimes (as opposed to waiting for the OECD). The U.S. GILTI and BEAT tax regimes are targeted at U.S. multinationals in Ireland, while the EU&#x27;s Digital Services Tax is also directed at perceived abuses by Ireland of the EU&#x27;s transfer pricing systems (particularly in regard to IP-based royalty payment charges).

For example, the new U.S. GILTI regime forces U.S. multinationals in Ireland to pay an effective corporate tax rate of over 12%, even with a full Irish IP BEPS tool (i.e. &quot;single malt&quot;, whose effective Irish tax rate is circa 0%). If they pay full Irish &quot;headline&quot; 12.5% corporate tax rate, the effective corporate tax rate rises to over 14%. This is compared to a new U.S. FDII tax regime of 13.125% for U.S.-based IP, which reduces to circa 12% after the higher U.S. tax relief.

U.S. multinationals like Pfizer announced in Q1 2018, a post-TCJA global tax rate for 2019 of circa 17%, which is very similar to the circa 16% expected by past U.S. multinational Irish tax inversions, Eaton, Allergan, and Medtronic. This is the effect of Pfizer being able to use the new U.S. 13.125% FDII regime, as well as the new U.S. BEAT regime penalising non-U.S. multinationals (and past tax inversions) by taxing income leaving the U.S. to go to low-tax corporate tax havens like Ireland.

Other jurisdictions, such as Japan, are also realising the extent to which IP-based BEPS tools are being used to manage global corporate taxes.

===U.S. as BEPS winner===

While the IRS has traditionally been seen as the main loser to global corporate tax havens, the 15.5% repatriation rate of the Trump administration Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 changes this calculus.

IP-heavy American corporations are the main users of BEPS tools. Studies show that as most other major economies run &quot;territorial&quot; tax systems, their corporates did not need to profit shift. They could just sell their IP to foreign markets from their home jurisdiction at low tax rates (e.g. 5% in Germany for German corporations). For example, there are no non-U.S./non-U.K. foreign corporates in Ireland&#x27;s top 50 firms by revenues, and only one by employees, German retailer Lidl (whereas 14 of Ireland&#x27;s top 20 firms are American multinationals). The British firms are mainly pre . (discussed here).

Had American multinationals not used IP-based BEPS tools in corporate tax havens, and paid the circa 25% corporation tax (average OECD rate) abroad, the IRS would have only received an additional 10% in tax, to bring the total effective American worldwide tax rate to 35%. However, after the TCJA, the IRS is now getting more tax, at the higher 15.5% rate, and American corporations have avoided the 25% foreign taxes and therefore will have brought more capital back to America as result.

This is at the expense of higher-tax Europe and Asian countries, who received no taxes from American corporations, as the corporations used IP-based BEPS tools from bases in corporate tax havens, while German corporations are charged 5% tax by their regulator.

President Trump did not sign the OECD&#x27;s June 2017 Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, as it felt that it had low exposure to profit shifting. An American official said at a transfer pricing conference that they did not sign the tax treaty inked by 68 [later 70] countries in Paris 7 June 2017 &quot;because the U.S. tax treaty network has a low degree of exposure to base erosion and profit shifting issues.&quot; This beneficial effect of global tax havens to the IRS was predicted by Hines and Rice in 1994 in which the authors said: &quot;some American business operations are drawn offshore by the lure of low tax rates in tax havens; nevertheless, the policies of tax havens may, on net, enhance the U.S. Treasury&#x27;s ability to collect tax revenue from American corporations.&quot;

==Corporate tax haven lists==

===Types of corporate tax haven lists===

Before 2015, many lists are of general tax havens (i.e. individual and corporate). Post 2015, quantitative studies (e.g. CORPNET and Gabriel Zucman), have highlighted the greater scale of corporate tax haven activity. The OECD, who only list one jurisdiction in the world as a tax haven, Trinidad and Tobago, note the scale of corporate tax haven activity. Note that the IMF list of offshore financial centres (&quot;OFC&quot;) is often cited as the first list to include the main corporate tax havens and the term OFC and corporate tax haven are often used interchangeably.

===Ten major corporate tax havens===

Regardless of method, most corporate tax haven lists consistently repeat ten jurisdictions (sometimes the Caribbean &quot;triad&quot; is one group), which comprise: 
Note four of these ten jurisdictions have financial centres that appear in 2017 top 10 Global Financial Centres Index: London, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Zurich. Luxembourg was in the top 15.

Note also from Conduit and Sink OFCs, that the latter groups (ii ex. Switzerland, and iii), rely on the first group (i), to act as a conduit in rerouting corporate untaxed income. In this regard, Ireland, the Netherlands, Singapore and the U.K., are considered the most important corporate tax havens, and the &quot;source&quot; of most global corporate tax avoidance.

Because of their larger size, it is not uncommon to see Switzerland and the United Kingdom dropped from more informal references to the main tax havens, for example:

===Hines Corporate tax havens===

James R. Hines Jr. is a founder of research into tax havens. His area of expertise is the U.S. corporate taxation system, and much of his research is on U.S. multinational use of tax havens. In 2010, Hines produced a table of U.S. multinational investment in havens, and produced the following ranking of the ten largest U.S. corporate tax havens:

===Zucman Corporate tax havens===

Tax haven academic Gabriel Zucman&#x27;s (et alia) June 2018 list calculates the actual quantum of actual taxes shielded (versus counting legal Orbis database connections, or company subsidiaries) by profit shifting. Ireland now exceeds the aggregate Caribbean complex (ex. Bermuda), in terms of being the largest overall global corporate tax haven (see ). Ireland is also the largest EU-28 corporate tax haven. The study estimates Ireland&#x27;s effective tax rate is really 4%. The U.K. is a notable absence. (slide 68).

===CORPNET Corporate tax havens===

From the 2017 investigation, published in &quot;Nature&quot;, into Conduit and Sink OFCs, comes CORPNET&#x27;s top 5 Conduit OFCs (i.e. corporate tax haven proxy), and top 5 Sink OFCs (i.e. traditional tax haven proxy), as calculated by analysing over 71 million global corporate connections on the Orbis database (i.e. it is by number of connections, not specifically by quantum of taxes shielded). Even though the method is different, CORPNET captures all of Zucman&#x27;s list but separated into Conduits and Sinks (and breaks out the Caribbean), however, Zucman&#x27;s list has a different ranking:

Conduit OFCs (by the number of corporate connections), 2017:
Sink OFCs (by the number of corporate connections), 2017:
===ITEP Corporate tax havens===
The first Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy list (Figure 1, page 11), is based on the % of Fortune 500 companies with subsidiaries in the corporate tax haven in 2016. The drawback of the list is that it is a U.S. focused list, and focuses on the number of connections (i.e. or subsidiaries) rather than the scale of taxes shielded. Contains all of Zucman&#x27;s list, but with Mauritius and Panama added as well.

Percentage of Fortune 500 companies with subsidiaries in the jurisdiction, 2016:
The second Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy list (Figure 4, page 16), is based on the reported profits of U.S. Fortune 500 controlled subsidiaries in 2013. It tries to capture the scale of taxes shielded by looking at reported profits as a proxy. Ireland now jumps to 2nd place, only just behind the Netherlands. The Netherlands-Ireland-Bermuda are usually the jurisdictions behind most &quot;double Irish with a Dutch sandwich&quot; BEPS schemes. Identical list to Zucman&#x27;s list but with the Caribbean broken out into individual jurisdictions (the Caymans, Bermuda, Bahamas and the BVI).

Size of profits routed by Fortune 500 companies via subsidiaries in the jurisdiction, 2016:
===Bloomberg Corporate tax inversions===

A simple but effective proxy are the destinations to where U.S. multinationals execute tax inversions (i.e. an important test of the attractiveness of a corporate tax haven). However, cases like inversions to Canada could reflect more of a &quot;relative-tax&quot; view (i.e. Canada offers lower taxes than the U.S. and it is close by and less controversial), than an &quot;absolute-tax&quot; view on the best global locations for a corporate tax haven. The list still captures much of Zucman&#x27;s list, particularly for the EU and the Caribbean. It captures the popularity of Ireland and the rise of the U.K.

Destinations for the 85 U.S. corporate inversions, since the first inversion in 1982, to the most recent inversion in 2016:
==GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy==
One of the simpler, but effective, methods proposed of identifying tax havens (both corporate and traditional) is by tracking the distortion that the tax-driven accounting flows make on national economic flows. This is an effect that is particularly pronounced for corporate tax havens due to the larger scale of accounting flows from the larger and . The following tables of the world&#x27;s top 15 GDP-per-capita jurisdictions are taken from the List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita for 2017 (from the IMF) and 2016 (from the World Bank).
