<text>Alice Malsenior Tallulah-Kate Walker (born February 9, 1944) is an American novelist, short story writer, poet, and social activist. In 1982, she became the first African-American woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, which she was awarded for her novel &quot;The Color Purple&quot;. Over the span of her career, Walker has published seventeen novels and short story collections, twelve non-fiction works, and collections of essays and poetry.

Walker, born in rural Georgia, overcame challenges such as childhood injury and segregation to become a valedictorian and eventually graduated from Sarah Lawrence College. She began her writing career with her first book of poetry, &quot;Once&quot;, and later wrote novels, including her best-known work, &quot;The Color Purple&quot;. As an activist, Walker participated in the Civil Rights Movement, advocated for women of color through the term &quot;womanism,&quot; and has been involved in animal advocacy and pacifism. Additionally, she has taken a strong stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, supporting the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign against Israel.

Walker has faced multiple accusations of antisemitism due to her praise for British conspiracy theorist David Icke and his works, which contain antisemitic conspiracy theories, along with criticisms of her own writings.

==Early life==

Alice Malsenior Walker was born in Eatonton, Georgia, a rural farming town, to Willie Lee Walker and Minnie Tallulah Grant. Both of Walker&#x27;s parents were sharecroppers, though her mother also worked as a seamstress to earn extra money. Walker, the youngest of eight children, was first enrolled in school when she was just four years old at East Putnam Consolidated.

As an eight-year-old, Walker sustained an injury to her right eye after one of her brothers fired a BB gun. Since her family did not have access to a car, Walker could not receive immediate medical attention, causing her to become permanently blind in that eye. It was after the injury to her eye that Walker began to take up reading and writing. The scar tissue was removed when Walker was 14, but a mark still remains. It is described in her essay &quot;Beauty: When the Other Dancer is the Self&quot;.

As the schools in Eatonton were segregated, Walker attended the only high school available to Black students: Butler Baker High School. There, she went on to become valedictorian, and enrolled in Spelman College in 1961 after being granted a full scholarship by the state of Georgia for having the highest academic achievements of her class. She found two of her professors, Howard Zinn and Staughton Lynd, to be great mentors during her time at Spelman, but both were transferred two years later. Walker was offered another scholarship, this time from Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, New York, and after the firing of her Spelman professor, Howard Zinn, Walker accepted the offer. Walker became pregnant at the start of her senior year and had an abortion; this experience, as well as the bout of suicidal thoughts that followed, inspired much of the poetry found in &quot;Once&quot;, Walker&#x27;s first collection of poetry. Walker graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1965.

==Writing career==

Walker wrote the poems that would culminate in her first book of poetry, entitled &quot;Once&quot;, while she was a student in East Africa and during her senior year at Sarah Lawrence College. Walker would slip her poetry under the office door of her professor and mentor, Muriel Rukeyser, when she was a student at Sarah Lawrence. Rukeyser then showed the poems to her literary agent. &quot;Once&quot; was published four years later by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.

Following graduation, Walker briefly worked for the New York City Department of Welfare, before returning to the South. She took a job working for the Legal Defense Fund of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Jackson, Mississippi. Walker also worked as a consultant in Black history to the Friends of the Children of Mississippi Head Start program. She later returned to writing as writer-in-residence at Jackson State University (1968–69) and Tougaloo College (1970–71). In addition to her work at Tougaloo College, Walker published her first novel, &quot;The Third Life of Grange Copeland,&quot; in 1970. The novel explores the life of Grange Copeland, an abusive, irresponsible sharecropper, husband and father.

In 1973, before becoming editor of &quot;Ms.&quot; &quot; magazine, Walker and literary scholar Charlotte D. Hunt discovered an unmarked grave they believed to be that of Zora Neale Hurston in Ft. Pierce, Florida. Walker had it marked with a gray marker stating ZORA NEALE HURSTON / &quot;A GENIUS OF THE SOUTH&quot; / NOVELIST FOLKLORIST / ANTHROPOLOGIST / 1901–1960. The line &quot;a genius of the south&quot; is from Jean Toomer&#x27;s poem &quot;Georgia Dusk&quot;, which appears in his book &quot;Cane&quot;. Hurston was actually born in 1891, not 1901.

Walker&#x27;s 1975 article &quot;In Search of Zora Neale Hurston&quot;, published in &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine and later retitled &quot;Looking for Zora&quot;, helped revive interest in the work of this Afro-American writer and anthropologist.
In 1976, Walker&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Meridian,&quot; was published. &quot;Meridian&quot; is a novel about activist workers in the South, during the civil rights movement, with events that closely parallel some of Walker&#x27;s own experiences. In 1982, she published what has become her best-known work, &quot;The Color Purple&quot;. The novel follows a young, troubled Black woman who is not just fighting her way through a racist white culture, she is also fighting her way through a patriarchal Black culture. The book became a bestseller, and it was subsequently adapted into a critically acclaimed 1985 movie which was directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Oprah Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg, as well as a 2005 Broadway musical totaling 910 performances.

Walker has written several other novels, including &quot;The Temple of My Familiar&quot; (1989) and &quot;Possessing the Secret of Joy&quot; (1992) (which featured several characters and descendants of characters from &quot;The Color Purple&quot;). She has published a number of collections of short stories, poetry, and other writings. Her work is focused on the struggles of Black people, particularly women, and their lives in a racist, sexist, and violent society.

In 1993, Alice Walker coauthored a novel, &quot;Warrior Marks,&quot; alongside feminist activist, Pratibha Parmar. The novel was based on the topic of &quot;Female Genital Mutilation&quot; (FGM) and the Sexual Blinding of Women. The novel takes place in Africa, where the two of them collectively interview several survivors of FGM. The novel seeks to unearth the sociocultural rationale behind the practice by providing a platform to activists who stand in opposition to this issue.

In 2000, Walker released a collection of short fiction, based on her own life, called &quot;The Way Forward Is With a Broken Heart,&quot; exploring love and race relations. In this book, Walker details her interracial relationship with Melvyn Rosenman Leventhal, a civil rights attorney who was also working in Mississippi. The couple married on March 17, 1967, in New York City, since interracial marriage was then illegal in the South, and divorced in 1976. They had a daughter, Rebecca, together in 1969. Rebecca Walker, Alice Walker&#x27;s only child, is an American novelist, editor, artist, and activist. The Third Wave Foundation, an activist fund, was co-founded by Rebecca and Shannon Liss-Riordan. Her godmother is Alice Walker&#x27;s mentor and co-founder of &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine, Gloria Steinem.

In 2007, Walker donated her papers, consisting of 122 boxes of manuscripts and archive material, to Emory University&#x27;s Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library. In addition to drafts of novels such as &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, unpublished poems and manuscripts, and correspondence with editors, the collection includes extensive correspondence with family members, friends and colleagues, early treatment of the film script for &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, syllabi from courses she taught, and fan mail. The collection also contains a scrapbook of poetry compiled when Walker was 15, entitled &quot;Poems of a Childhood Poetess&quot;.

In 2013, Alice Walker published two new books, one of them entitled &quot;The Cushion in the Road: Meditation and Wandering as the Whole World Awakens to Being in Harm&#x27;s Way&quot;. The other was a book of poems entitled &quot;The World Will Follow Joy: Turning Madness into Flowers (New Poems)&quot;.

==Activism==
=== Civil rights ===

Walker met Martin Luther King Jr. when she was a student at Spelman College in the early 1960s. She credits King for her decision to return to the American South as an activist in the Civil Rights Movement. She took part in the 1963 March on Washington with hundreds of thousands of people. Later, she volunteered to register Black voters in Georgia and Mississippi.

On March 8, 2003, International Women&#x27;s Day, on the eve of the Iraq War, Walker was arrested with 26 others, including fellow authors Maxine Hong Kingston and Terry Tempest Williams, at a protest outside the White House, for crossing a police line during an anti-war rally. Walker wrote about the experience in her essay &quot;We Are the Ones We Have Been Waiting For&quot;.

=== Womanism ===

Walker&#x27;s specific brand of feminism included advocacy on behalf of women of color. In 1983, Walker coined the term &quot;womanist&quot; in her collection &quot;In Search of Our Mothers&#x27; Gardens&quot;, to mean &quot;a Black feminist or feminist of color&quot;. The term was made to unite women of color and the feminist movement at &quot;the intersection of race, class, and gender oppression&quot;. Walker states that &quot;&#x27;Womanism&#x27; gives us a word of our own&quot;. because it is a discourse of Black women and the issues they confront in society. Womanism as a movement came into fruition in 1985 at the American Academy of Religion and the Society of Biblical Literature to address Black women&#x27;s concerns from their own intellectual, physical, and spiritual perspectives.&quot; Today, her womanist ideology still persists within several movements including the Black Lives Matter Movement that was formed by Black women in response to overwhelming police brutality against Black males. The philosophy of womanism also served as the fundamental basis for the #MeToo Movement in which women publicly expressed their experiences of sexual abuse and harassment.

=== Feminist advocacy ===
Walker&#x27;s idea of feminist advocacy emerged in her work, &quot;In Search of Our Mothers&#x27; Gardens&quot;, specifically in the essay, &quot;If the Present Looked Like the Past, what would the future Look Like?&quot;. In her piece, she reflects on the modern injustices and historical oppression of the feminist movement. She also touches upon the need for compassion, empathy and awareness on behalf of Black women to overcome the past atrocities such as slavery and colonialism. In the end, the essay provides both a critique on the Black feminist movement and a call to action for readers to liberate themselves from discrimination.

=== Israeli–Palestinian conflict ===

Walker is a judge member of the Russell Tribunal on Palestine, and she also supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel.

In January 2009, Walker was one of over fifty signatories of a letter protesting against the Toronto International Film Festival&#x27;s &quot;City to City&quot; spotlight on Israeli filmmakers, and condemning Israel as an &quot;apartheid regime&quot;. Two months later, Walker and sixty other female activists from the anti-war group Code Pink traveled to Gaza in response to the Gaza War. Their purpose was to deliver aid, meet with NGOs and residents, and persuade Israel and Egypt to open their borders with Gaza. She planned to visit Gaza again in December 2009 to participate in the Gaza Freedom March. On June 23, 2011, she announced plans to participate in an aid flotilla to Gaza that attempted to break Israel&#x27;s naval blockade.

In May 2013, Walker posted an open letter to singer Alicia Keys, asking her to cancel a planned concert in Tel Aviv. &quot;I believe we are mutually respectful of each other&#x27;s path and work,&quot; Walker wrote. &quot;It would grieve me to know you are putting yourself in danger (soul danger) by performing in an apartheid country that is being boycotted by many global conscious artists.&quot; Keys rejected the plea. Walker has refused to allow &quot;The Color Purple&quot; to be translated and published in Hebrew, saying that she finds that &quot;Israel is guilty of apartheid and persecution of the Palestinian people, both inside Israel and also in the Occupied Territories&quot; and noting that she had refused to allow Steven Spielberg&#x27;s film adaptation of her novel to be shown in South Africa until the system of apartheid was dismantled.

===Support for Chelsea Manning and Julian Assange===

In June 2013, Walker and others appeared in a video expressing their support for Chelsea Manning, an American soldier who was imprisoned for releasing classified information. In recent years, Walker has spoken out repeatedly in support of Julian Assange. Founder of Wikileaks, Assange was considered a large threat to U.S. national security during the Obama administration, as he revealed classified intelligence information surrounding war crimes and human rights violations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay. Subsequently, Assange was arrested after attempting to seek refuge in the Ecuador embassy in London. He was later extradited to the U.S. and prosecuted on criminal charges. In light of these developments, Alice Walker published an Opinion Editorial taking aim at the US justice system and calling for the vindication of the charges brought against Assange. Moreover, Walker also took part in a panel discussion in Berkeley, California for the purpose of freeing Assange.

=== Animal advocacy ===
Walker has expressed that animal advocacy is one of her central concerns. Her fiction has increasingly embraced animal ethics over the past four decades, as she works to include animals as both active participants in her novels and as symbols for what she has called &quot;consciousness.&quot; Her earliest fiction represents nonhuman animals inasmuch as they are part of human life – namely as farmed animals, food sources, and absent referents for animalized epithets directed at humans, and her fiction increasingly incorporates the animal experience. She has advocated for greater consciousness in human beings and their relationships with animals, stating: &quot;Encouraging others to love nature, to respect other human beings and animals, to adore this earth, is part of my work in this world.&quot;

===Pacifism===

Walker has been a longtime sponsor of the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom. In early 2015, she wrote: &quot;So I think of any movement for peace and justice as something that is about stabilizing our inner spirit so that we can go on and bring into the world a vision that is much more humane than the one we have dominant today.&quot; She has written several works that convey her pacifist views, those including &quot;The Same River Twice&quot; and &quot;We are the Ones We have been Waiting for: Inner Light in a Time of Darkness.&quot; She discusses the importance for establishing an equitable and peaceful society. 

=== Transgender rights ===
In 2023, Walker publicly defended J. K. Rowling from criticisms of her views regarding trans people. Walker wrote on her website: &quot;I consider J.K. Rowling perfectly within her rights as a human being of obvious caring for humanity to express her views about whatever is of concern to her. As she has done.&quot; She herself expressed the view that women were being &quot;erased&quot; in language, dictionaries and society, and that &quot;confusion&quot; with respect to gender had led to hasty sex reassignment surgeries, at least when minors were concerned. Walker was criticized on social media for taking this position with many referring to her as a TERF. In a subsequent essay, Walker addressed trans people, stating: &quot;I fully understand that your life belongs to you; therefore whatever changes you make, I offer my prayers for a beautiful transformation and complete recovery&quot;, and acknowledged that one of the &quot;most loving and balanced people&quot; she knew was a trans man.

== Accusations of antisemitism and praise for David Icke ==

Since 2012, Walker has expressed appreciation for the works of the British conspiracy theorist David Icke. On BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, she said that Icke&#x27;s book &quot;Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More&quot;, which contains antisemitic conspiracy theories, would be the book she would take to a desert island. The book promotes the theory that the Earth is ruled by shapeshifting reptilian humanoids and &quot;Rothschild Zionists&quot;. Jonathan Kay of the &quot;National Post&quot; described this book (and Icke&#x27;s other books) as &quot;hateful, hallucinogenic nonsense&quot;. Kay wrote that Walker&#x27;s public praise for Icke&#x27;s book was &quot;stunningly offensive&quot; and that by taking it seriously, she was disqualifying herself &quot;from the mainstream marketplace of ideas&quot;. In 2013, the Anti-Defamation League called anti-Zionist essays in Walker&#x27;s book &quot;The Cushion in the Road&quot; &quot;replete with fervently anti-Jewish ideas&quot; and it also stated that Walker was &quot;unabashedly infected with anti-Semitism&quot;.

On her blog in 2017, Walker published a poem which she titled &quot;It Is Our (Frightful) Duty to Study The Talmud&quot;, recommending that the reader should start with YouTube to learn about the allegedly shocking aspects of the Talmud, describing it as &quot;poison&quot;. The poem contained antisemitic tropes and arguments. In it, she also &quot;describes her reaction when a Jewish friend&quot;, later stated to be her ex-husband, accused her &quot;of appearing to be antisemitic&quot;.

In 2018, an interviewer from &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; asked Walker &quot;What books are on your nightstand?&quot; She listed Icke&#x27;s &quot;And the Truth Shall Set You Free,&quot; a book promoting an antisemitic conspiracy theory which draws on &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; and questions the Holocaust. Walker said: &quot;In Icke&#x27;s books there is the whole of existence, on this planet and several others, to think about. A curious person&#x27;s dream come true.&quot; The publication of the interview in the &quot;By the Book&quot; weekly column generated significant criticism of Walker and the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;. The &quot;Review&quot; was criticized for publishing the interview as well as for failing to contextualize &quot;And the Truth Shall Set You Free&quot; as an antisemitic work. Walker defended her admiration for Icke and his book, saying: &quot;I do not believe he is anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish&quot;. Walker argued that any &quot;attempt to smear David Icke, and by association, me, is really an effort to dampen the effect of our speaking out in support of the people of Palestine&quot;. Following the controversy Roxane Gay argued that &quot;Alice Walker has been anti-Semitic for years&quot;. The NYT released a statement that the contents of the interview &quot;do not imply an endorsement by Times editors&quot;.

In 2019, Ayanna Pressley disavowed antisemitism after an uproar ensued following her tweeting of an Alice Walker quote. She tweeted &quot;I fully condemn and denounce anti-Semitism, prejudice and bigotry in all their forms – and the hateful actions they embolden&quot; and said she had been unaware of Walker&#x27;s statements on the issue.

In 2020, after learning about Walker&#x27;s perceived support of anti-Semitism, the host of the &quot;New York Times&quot; podcast &quot;Sugar Calling&quot; described herself as &quot;mortified&quot; for having hosted Walker on her show and she also said: &quot;If I&#x27;d known, I wouldn&#x27;t have asked Alice Walker to be on the show.&quot;

In April 2022, Gayle King of CBS News was criticized for interviewing Walker without challenging her anti-Semitic writings. After the interview, King released a statement, saying: &quot;These are not only legitimate questions, they are mandatory questions. I certainly would have asked her about the criticisms, if I had been aware of them before the interview with Ms. Walker.&quot;

In 2022, Walker was disinvited from the Bay Area Book Festival due to what the organizers referred to as her &quot;endorsement of anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist David Icke&quot;. An invitation for Walker to speak at San Diego Community College District was upheld despite opposition from community groups with the organizers citing their belief in free speech. Walker dismissed the criticism as &quot;a ploy to shut down my webpage blog: alicewalkersgarden.com.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1965, Walker met Melvyn Rosenman Leventhal, a Jewish civil rights lawyer. They were married on March 17, 1967, in New York City. Later that year, the couple relocated to Jackson, Mississippi, becoming the first legally married interracial couple in Mississippi since miscegenation laws were introduced in the state. The couple had a daughter, Rebecca, in 1969. Walker and her husband divorced in 1976.

In the late 1970s, Walker moved to northern California. In 1984, she and fellow writer Robert L. Allen co-founded Wild Tree Press, a feminist publishing company in Anderson Valley, California. Walker legally added &quot;Tallulah Kate&quot; to her name in 1994 to honor her mother, Minnie Tallulah Grant, and paternal grandmother, Tallulah. Minnie Tallulah Grant&#x27;s grandmother, Tallulah, was Cherokee.

Walker has claimed that she was in a romantic relationship with singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman in the mid-1990s: &quot;It was delicious and lovely and wonderful and I totally enjoyed it and I was completely in love with her but it was not anybody&#x27;s business but ours.&quot; Despite Walker&#x27;s claims, Chapman has not publicly commented on the existence of a relationship between herself and Walker and maintains a strict separation between her private and public life.

Walker&#x27;s spirituality has influenced some of her best-known novels, including &quot;The Color Purple.&quot; She has written of her interest in Transcendental Meditation. Walker&#x27;s exploration of religion in much of her writing draws on a literary tradition that includes writers like Zora Neale Hurston.

Walker has never denied that there are some autobiographical dimensions to her stories. When &quot;Advancing Luna—and Ida B. Wells&quot; was first published in &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine, Walker included a disclaimer that &quot;Luna and Freddie Pye are composite characters, and their names are made up. This is a fictionalized account suggested by a number of real events&quot;. John O&#x27; Brien&#x27;s 1973 interview with Walker offers further details.

== Teaching and Feminist Rights Movement ==
Aside from her civil rights activism, Walker would often educate others about the Black feminist movement through her teachings at several different higher education institutions. In the fall of 1972, Walker taught a course in Black Women&#x27;s Writers at the University of Massachusetts Boston. as well as Wellesley College in 1973. Moreover, that same year, she also published her primary collection of short stories &quot;In Love and Trouble: Stories of Black Women,&quot; as well as &quot;Revolutionary Petunias and Other Poems&quot; which served as a second volume of her poetry. In addition, she also taught an American Women studies class at Brandeis University in Waltham. Aside from the schools in Massachusetts at which she taught at, she gave several lectures on the topics of African-American Women Studies at Yale University as well as University of California, Berkeley. Overall, Walker gave several lectures at a variety of different institutions throughout America which allowed her to spread the ideas of the Black feminist movement. 

==Representation in other media==
&quot;Beauty in Truth&quot; (2013) is a documentary film about Walker directed by Pratibha Parmar. &quot;Phalia (Portrait of Alice Walker)&quot; (1989) is a photograph by Maud Sulter from her &quot;Zabat&quot; series originally produced for the Rochdale Art Gallery in England.

Her first novel, &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot;, was published in 1970. The critically acclaimed &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; (1977) brought her national attention and won the National Book Critics Circle Award. In 1988, Morrison won the Pulitzer Prize for &quot;Beloved&quot; (1987); she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993.

Born and raised in Lorain, Ohio, Morrison graduated from Howard University in 1953 with a B.A. in English. Morrison earned a master&#x27;s degree in American Literature from Cornell University in 1955. In 1957 she returned to Howard University, was married, and had two children before divorcing in 1964. Morrison became the first black female editor for fiction at Random House in New York City in the late 1960s. She developed her own reputation as an author in the 1970s and &#x27;80s. Her novel &quot;Beloved&quot; was made into a film in 1998. Morrison&#x27;s works are praised for addressing the harsh consequences of racism in the United States and the Black American experience.

The National Endowment for the Humanities selected Morrison for the Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government&#x27;s highest honor for achievement in the humanities, in 1996. She was honored with the National Book Foundation&#x27;s Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters the same year. President Barack Obama presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom on May 29, 2012. She received the PEN/Saul Bellow Award for Achievement in American Fiction in 2016. Morrison was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2020.

== Early years ==
Toni Morrison was born Chloe Ardelia Wofford, the second of four children from a working-class, Black family, in Lorain, Ohio, to Ramah (née Willis) and George Wofford. Her mother was born in Greenville, Alabama, and moved north with her family as a child. She was a homemaker and a devout member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. George Wofford grew up in Cartersville, Georgia. When Wofford was about 15 years old, a group of white people lynched two African-American businessmen who lived on his street. Morrison later said: &quot;He never told us that he&#x27;d seen bodies. But he had seen them. And that was too traumatic, I think, for him.&quot; Soon after the lynching, George Wofford moved to the racially integrated town of Lorain, Ohio, in the hope of escaping racism and securing gainful employment in Ohio&#x27;s burgeoning industrial economy. He worked odd jobs and as a welder for U.S. Steel. In a 2015 interview Morrison said that her father, traumatized by his experiences of racism, hated whites so much he would not let them in the house.

When Morrison was about two years old, her family&#x27;s landlord set fire to the house in which they lived, while they were home, because her parents could not afford to pay rent. Her family responded to what she called this &quot;bizarre form of evil&quot; by laughing at the landlord rather than falling into despair. Morrison later said her family&#x27;s response demonstrated how to keep your integrity and claim your own life in the face of acts of such &quot;monumental crudeness&quot;.

Morrison&#x27;s parents instilled in her a sense of heritage and language through telling traditional African-American folktales, ghost stories, and singing songs. She read frequently as a child; among her favorite authors were Jane Austen and Leo Tolstoy.

Morrison became a Catholic at the age of 12 and took the baptismal name Anthony (after Anthony of Padua), which led to her nickname, Toni. Attending Lorain High School, she was on the debate team, the yearbook staff, and in the drama club.

==Career==
=== Adulthood, Howard and Cornell years, and editing career: 1949–1975 ===
In 1949, she enrolled at Howard University in Washington, D.C., seeking the company of fellow black intellectuals. She was the first person in her family to attend college, meaning that she was a first-generation college student. Initially a student in the drama program at Howard, she studied theatre with celebrated drama teachers Anne Cooke Reid and Owen Dodson. It was while at Howard that she encountered racially segregated restaurants and buses for the first time. She graduated in 1953 with a B.A. in English and a minor in Classics, and was able to work with key members of the Harlem Renaissance era such as Alain Locke and Sterling Brown. Additionally, she participated in the university&#x27;s theater group, known as the Howard Players, where she had the opportunity to travel the Deep South, which was a defining experience of her life. 

Morrison went on to earn a Master of Arts degree in 1955 from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Her master&#x27;s thesis was titled &quot;Virginia Woolf&#x27;s and William Faulkner&#x27;s treatment of the alienated&quot;. She taught English, first at Texas Southern University in Houston from 1955 to 1957, and then at Howard University for the next seven years. While teaching at Howard, she met Harold Morrison, a Jamaican architect, whom she married in 1958. Their first son was born in 1961 and she was pregnant with their second son when she and Harold divorced in 1964.

After her divorce and the birth of her son Slade in 1965, Morrison began working as an editor for L. W. Singer, a textbook division of publisher Random House, in Syracuse, New York. Two years later, she transferred to Random House in New York City, where she became their first black woman senior editor in the fiction department.

In that capacity, Morrison played a vital role in bringing Black literature into the mainstream. One of the first books she worked on was the groundbreaking &quot;Contemporary African Literature&quot; (1972), a collection that included work by Nigerian writers Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe, and South African playwright Athol Fugard. She fostered a new generation of Afro-American writers, including poet and novelist Toni Cade Bambara, radical activist Angela Davis, Black Panther Huey Newton and novelist Gayl Jones, whose writing Morrison discovered. She also brought to publication the 1975 autobiography of the outspoken boxing champion Muhammad Ali, &quot;The Greatest: My Own Story&quot;. In addition, she published and promoted the work of Henry Dumas, a little-known novelist and poet who in 1968 had been shot to death by a transit officer in the New York City Subway.

Among other books that Morrison developed and edited is &quot;The Black Book&quot; (1974), an anthology of photographs, illustrations, essays, and documents of Black life in the United States from the time of slavery to the 1920s. Random House had been uncertain about the project but its publication met with a good reception. Alvin Beam reviewed the anthology for the Cleveland &quot;Plain Dealer&quot;, writing: &quot;Editors, like novelists, have brain childrenbooks they think up and bring to life without putting their own names on the title page. Mrs. Morrison has one of these in the stores now, and magazines and newsletters in the publishing trade are ecstatic, saying it will go like hotcakes.&quot;

=== First writings and teaching, 1970–1986 ===
Morrison had begun writing fiction as part of an informal group of poets and writers at Howard University who met to discuss their work. She attended one meeting with a short story about a Black girl who longed to have blue eyes. Morrison later developed the story as her first novel, &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot;, getting up every morning at 4 am to write, while raising two children on her own.

&quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; was published by Holt, Rinehart, and Winston in 1970, when Morrison was aged 39. It was favorably reviewed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by John Leonard, who praised Morrison&#x27;s writing style as being &quot;a prose so precise, so faithful to speech and so charged with pain and wonder that the novel becomes poetry ... But &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; is also history, sociology, folklore, nightmare and music.&quot; The novel did not sell well at first, but the City University of New York put &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; on its reading list for its new Black studies department, as did other colleges, which boosted sales. The book also brought Morrison to the attention of the acclaimed editor Robert Gottlieb at Knopf, an imprint of the publisher Random House. Gottlieb later edited all but one of Morrison&#x27;s novels.

In 1975, Morrison&#x27;s second novel &quot;Sula&quot; (1973), about a friendship between two Black women, was nominated for the National Book Award. Her third novel, &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; (1977), follows the life of Macon &quot;Milkman&quot; Dead III, from birth to adulthood, as he discovers his heritage. This novel brought her national acclaim, being a main selection of the Book of the Month Club, the first novel by a Black writer to be so chosen since Richard Wright&#x27;s &quot;Native Son&quot; in 1940. &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; also won the National Book Critics Circle Award.

At its 1979 commencement ceremonies, Barnard College awarded Morrison its highest honor, the Barnard Medal of Distinction.

Morrison gave her next novel, &quot;Tar Baby&quot; (1981), a contemporary setting. In it, a looks-obsessed fashion model, Jadine, falls in love with Son, a penniless drifter who feels at ease with being Black.

Resigning from Random House in 1983, Morrison left publishing to devote more time to writing, while living in a converted boathouse on the Hudson River in Nyack, New York. She taught English at two branches of the State University of New York (SUNY) and at Rutgers University&#x27;s New Brunswick campus. In 1984, she was appointed to an Albert Schweitzer chair at the University at Albany, SUNY.

Morrison&#x27;s first play, &quot;Dreaming Emmett&quot;, is about the 1955 murder by white men of Black teenager Emmett Till. The play was commissioned by the New York State Writers Institute at the State University of New York at Albany, where she was teaching at the time. It was produced in 1986 by Capital Repertory Theatre and directed by Gilbert Moses. Morrison was also a visiting professor at Bard College from 1986 to 1988.

=== &quot;Beloved&quot; trilogy and the Nobel Prize: 1987–1998 ===

In 1987, Morrison published her most celebrated novel, &quot;Beloved&quot;. It was inspired by the true story of an enslaved African-American woman, Margaret Garner, whose story Morrison had discovered when compiling &quot;The Black Book&quot;. Garner had escaped slavery but was pursued by slave hunters. Facing a return to slavery, Garner killed her two-year-old daughter but was captured before she could kill herself. Morrison&#x27;s novel imagines the dead baby returning as a ghost, Beloved, to haunt her mother and family.

&quot;Beloved&quot; was a critical success and a bestseller for 25 weeks. &quot;The New York Times&quot; book reviewer Michiko Kakutani wrote that the scene of the mother killing her baby is &quot;so brutal and disturbing that it appears to warp time before and after into a single unwavering line of fate&quot;. Canadian writer Margaret Atwood wrote in a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Ms. Morrison&#x27;s versatility and technical and emotional range appear to know no bounds. If there were any doubts about her stature as a pre-eminent American novelist, of her own or any other generation, &quot;Beloved&quot; will put them to rest.&quot;

Some critics panned &quot;Beloved&quot;. African-American conservative social critic Stanley Crouch, for instance, complained in his review in &quot;The New Republic&quot; that the novel &quot;reads largely like a melodrama lashed to the structural conceits of the miniseries&quot;, and that Morrison &quot;perpetually interrupts her narrative with maudlin ideological commercials&quot;.

Despite overall high acclaim, &quot;Beloved&quot; failed to win the prestigious National Book Award or the National Book Critics Circle Award. Forty-eight Black critics and writers, among them Maya Angelou, protested the omission in a statement that &quot;The New York Times&quot; published on January 24, 1988. &quot;Despite the international stature of Toni Morrison, she has yet to receive the national recognition that her five major works of fiction entirely deserve&quot;, they wrote. Two months later, &quot;Beloved&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. It also won an Anisfield-Wolf Book Award.

&quot;Beloved&quot; is the first of three novels about love and African-American history, sometimes called the &quot;Beloved&quot; Trilogy. Morrison said they are intended to be read together, explaining: &quot;The conceptual connection is the search for the beloved – the part of the self that is you, and loves you, and is always there for you.&quot; The second novel in the trilogy, &quot;Jazz&quot;, came out in 1992. Told in language that imitates the rhythms of jazz music, the novel is about a love triangle during the Harlem Renaissance in New York City. According to Lyn Innes, &quot;Morrison sought to change not just the content and audience for her fiction; her desire was to create stories which could be lingered over and relished, not &#x27;consumed and gobbled as fast food&#x27;, and at the same time to ensure that these stories and their characters had a strong historical and cultural base.&quot;

In 1992, Morrison also published her first book of literary criticism, &quot;Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination&quot; (1992), an examination of the African-American presence in White American literature. (In 2016, &quot;Time&quot; magazine noted that &quot;Playing in the Dark&quot; was among Morrison&#x27;s most-assigned texts on U.S. college campuses, together with several of her novels and her 1993 Nobel Prize lecture.) Lyn Innes wrote in the &quot;Guardian&quot; obituary of Morrison, &quot;Her 1990 series of Massey lectures at Harvard were published as Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination (1992), and explore the construction of a &#x27;non-white Africanist presence and personae&#x27; in the works of Poe, Hawthorne, Melville, Cather and Hemingway, arguing that &#x27;all of us are bereft when criticism remains too polite or too fearful to notice a disrupting darkness before its eyes&#x27;.&quot;

Before the third novel of the &quot;Beloved&quot; Trilogy was published, Morrison was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993. The citation praised her as an author &quot;who in novels characterized by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality&quot;. She was the first Black woman of any nationality to win the prize. In her acceptance speech, Morrison said: &quot;We die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do language. That may be the measure of our lives.&quot;

In her Nobel lecture, Morrison talked about the power of storytelling. To make her point, she told a story. She spoke about a blind, old, Black woman who is approached by a group of young people. They demand of her, &quot;Is there no context for our lives? No song, no literature, no poem full of vitamins, no history connected to experience that you can pass along to help us start strong? ... Think of our lives and tell us your particularized world. Make up a story.&quot;

In 1996, the National Endowment for the Humanities selected Morrison for the Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government&#x27;s highest honor for &quot;distinguished intellectual achievement in the humanities&quot;. Morrison&#x27;s lecture, entitled &quot;The Future of Time: Literature and Diminished Expectations&quot;, began with the aphorism: &quot;Time, it seems, has no future.&quot; She cautioned against the misuse of history to diminish expectations of the future. Morrison was also honored with the 1996 National Book Foundation&#x27;s Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, which is awarded to a writer &quot;who has enriched our literary heritage over a life of service, or a corpus of work&quot;.

The third novel of her &quot;Beloved&quot; Trilogy, &quot;Paradise&quot;, about citizens of an all-Black town, came out in 1997. The following year, Morrison was on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, making her only the second female writer of fiction and second Black writer of fiction to appear on what was perhaps the most significant U.S. magazine cover of the era.

===&quot;Beloved&quot; onscreen and &quot;the Oprah effect&quot;===
Also in 1998, the movie adaptation of &quot;Beloved&quot; was released, directed by Jonathan Demme and co-produced by Oprah Winfrey, who had spent ten years bringing it to the screen. Winfrey also stars as the main character, Sethe, alongside Danny Glover as Sethe&#x27;s lover, Paul D, and Thandiwe Newton as Beloved.

The movie flopped at the box office. A review in &quot;The Economist&quot; opined that &quot;most audiences are not eager to endure nearly three hours of a cerebral film with an original storyline featuring supernatural themes, murder, rape, and slavery&quot;. Film critic Janet Maslin, in her &quot;New York Times&quot; review &quot;No Peace from a Brutal Legacy&quot;, called it a &quot;transfixing, deeply felt adaptation of Toni Morrison&#x27;s novel. ... Its linchpin is of course Oprah Winfrey, who had the clout and foresight to bring &#x27;Beloved&#x27; to the screen and has the dramatic presence to hold it together.&quot; Film critic Roger Ebert suggested that &quot;Beloved&quot; was not a genre ghost story but the supernatural was used to explore deeper issues and the non-linear structure of Morrison&#x27;s story had a purpose.

In 1996, television talk-show host Oprah Winfrey selected &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; for her newly launched Book Club, which became a popular feature on her &quot;Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. An average of 13 million viewers watched the show&#x27;s book club segments. As a result, when Winfrey selected Morrison&#x27;s earliest novel &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; in 2000, it sold another 800,000 paperback copies. John Young wrote in the &quot;African American Review&quot; in 2001 that Morrison&#x27;s career experienced the boost of &quot;The Oprah Effect, ... enabling Morrison to reach a broad, popular audience.&quot;

Winfrey selected a total of four of Morrison&#x27;s novels over six years, giving Morrison&#x27;s works a bigger sales boost than they received from her Nobel Prize win in 1993. The novelist also appeared three times on Winfrey&#x27;s show. Winfrey said, &quot;For all those who asked the question &#x27;Toni Morrison again?&#x27;... I say with certainty there would have been no Oprah&#x27;s Book Club if this woman had not chosen to share her love of words with the world.&quot; Morrison called the book club a &quot;reading revolution&quot;.

=== Early 21st century ===
Morrison continued to explore different art forms, such as providing texts for original scores of classical music. She collaborated with André Previn on the song cycle &quot;Honey and Rue&quot;, which premiered with Kathleen Battle in January 1992, and on &quot;Four Songs&quot;, premiered at Carnegie Hall with Sylvia McNair in November 1994. Both &quot;Sweet Talk: Four Songs on Text&quot; and &quot;Spirits In the Well&quot; (1997) were written for Jessye Norman with music by Richard Danielpour, and, alongside Maya Angelou and Clarissa Pinkola Estés, Morrison provided the text for composer Judith Weir&#x27;s &quot;woman.life.song&quot; commissioned by Carnegie Hall for Jessye Norman, which premiered in April 2000.

Morrison returned to Margaret Garner&#x27;s life story, the basis of her novel &quot;Beloved&quot;, to write the libretto for a new opera, &quot;Margaret Garner&quot;. Completed in 2002, with music by Richard Danielpour, the opera was premièred on May 7, 2005, at the Detroit Opera House with Denyce Graves in the title role. &quot;Love&quot;, Morrison&#x27;s first novel since &quot;Paradise&quot;, came out in 2003. In 2004, she put together a children&#x27;s book called &quot;Remember&quot; to mark the 50th anniversary of the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; Supreme Court decision in 1954 that declared racially segregated public schools to be unconstitutional.

From 1997 to 2003, Morrison was an Andrew D. White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University.

In 2004, Morrison was invited by Wellesley College to deliver the commencement address, which has been described as &quot;among the greatest commencement addresses of all time and a courageous counterpoint to the entire genre&quot;.

In June 2005, the University of Oxford awarded Morrison an honorary Doctor of Letters degree.

In the spring 2006, &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; named &quot;Beloved&quot; the best work of American fiction published in the previous 25 years, as chosen by a selection of prominent writers, literary critics, and editors. In his essay about the choice, &quot;In Search of the Best&quot;, critic A. O. Scott said: &quot;Any other outcome would have been startling since Morrison&#x27;s novel has inserted itself into the American canon more completely than any of its potential rivals. With remarkable speed, &#x27;Beloved&#x27; has, less than 20 years after its publication, become a staple of the college literary curriculum, which is to say a classic. This triumph is commensurate with its ambition since it was Morrison&#x27;s intention in writing it precisely to expand the range of classic American literature, to enter, as a living Black woman, the company of dead White males like Faulkner, Melville, Hawthorne and Twain.&quot;

In November 2006, Morrison visited the Louvre museum in Paris as the second in its &quot;Grand Invité&quot; program to guest-curate a month-long series of events across the arts on the theme of &quot;The Foreigner&#x27;s Home&quot;, about which &quot;The New York Times&quot; said: &quot;In tapping her own African-American culture, Ms. Morrison is eager to credit &#x27;foreigners&#x27; with enriching the countries where they settle.&quot;

Morrison&#x27;s novel &quot;A Mercy&quot;, released in 2008, is set in the Virginia colonies of 1682. Diane Johnson, in her review in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, called &quot;A Mercy&quot; &quot;a poetic, visionary, mesmerizing tale that captures, in the cradle of our present problems and strains, the natal curse put on us back then by the Indian tribes, Africans, Dutch, Portuguese, and English competing to get their footing in the New World against a hostile landscape and the essentially tragic nature of human experience.&quot;

=== Princeton years ===
From 1989 until her retirement in 2006, Morrison held the Robert F. Goheen Chair in the Humanities at Princeton University. She said she did not think much of modern fiction writers who reference their own lives instead of inventing new material, and she used to tell her creative writing students, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to hear about your little life, OK?&quot; Similarly, she chose not to write about her own life in a memoir or autobiography.

Though based in the Creative Writing Program at Princeton, Morrison did not regularly offer writing workshops to students after the late 1990s, a fact that earned her some criticism. Rather, she conceived and developed the Princeton Atelier, a program that brings together students with writers and performing artists. Together the students and the artists produce works of art that are presented to the public after a semester of collaboration.
Inspired by her curatorship at the Louvre Museum, Morrison returned to Princeton in the fall 2008 to lead a small seminar, also entitled &quot;The Foreigner&#x27;s Home&quot;.

On November 17, 2017, Princeton University dedicated Morrison Hall (a building previously called West College) in her honor.

=== Final years: 2010–2019 ===
In May 2010, Morrison appeared at PEN World Voices for a conversation with Marlene van Niekerk and Kwame Anthony Appiah about South African literature and specifically van Niekerk&#x27;s 2004 novel &quot;Agaat&quot;.

Morrison wrote books for children with her younger son, Slade Morrison, who was a painter and a musician. Slade died of pancreatic cancer on December 22, 2010, aged 45, when Morrison&#x27;s novel &quot;Home&quot; (2012) was half-completed.

In May 2011, Morrison received an Honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Rutgers University–New Brunswick. During the commencement ceremony, she delivered a speech on the &quot;pursuit of life, liberty, meaningfulness, integrity, and truth&quot;.
In 2011, Morrison worked with opera director Peter Sellars and Malian singer-songwriter Rokia Traoré on &quot;Desdemona&quot;, taking a fresh look at William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Othello&quot;. The trio focused on the relationship between Othello&#x27;s wife Desdemona and her African nursemaid, Barbary, who is only briefly referenced in Shakespeare. The play, a mix of words, music and song, premiered in Vienna in 2011.

Morrison had stopped working on her latest novel when her son died in 2010, later explaining, &quot;I stopped writing until I began to think, He would be really put out if he thought that he had caused me to stop. &#x27;Please, Mom, I&#x27;m dead, could you keep going ...?

She completed &quot;Home&quot; and dedicated it to her son Slade. Published in 2012, it is the story of a Korean War veteran in the segregated United States of the 1950s who tries to save his sister from brutal medical experiments at the hands of a white doctor.

In August 2012, Oberlin College became the home base of the Toni Morrison Society, an international literary society founded in 1993, dedicated to scholarly research of Morrison&#x27;s work.

Morrison&#x27;s eleventh novel, &quot;God Help the Child&quot;, was published in 2015. It follows Bride, an executive in the fashion and beauty industry whose mother tormented her as a child for being dark-skinned, a trauma that has continued to dog Bride.

Morrison was a member of the editorial advisory board of &quot;The Nation&quot;, a magazine started in 1865 by Northern abolitionists.

==Personal life==
While teaching at Howard University from 1957 to 1964, she met Harold Morrison, a Jamaican architect, whom she married in 1958. She took his last name and became known as Toni Morrison. Their first son, Harold Ford, was born in 1961. She was pregnant when she and Harold divorced in 1964. Her second son, Slade Kevin, was born in 1965.

Her son Slade Morrison died of pancreatic cancer on December 22, 2010, when Morrison was halfway through writing her novel &quot;Home.&quot; She stopped work on the novel for a year or two before completing it; that novel was published in 2012.

==Death==
Morrison died at Montefiore Medical Center in The Bronx, New York City, on August 5, 2019, from complications of pneumonia. She was 88 years old.

A memorial tribute was held on November 21, 2019, at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. Morrison was eulogized by, among others, Oprah Winfrey, Angela Davis, Michael Ondaatje, David Remnick, Fran Lebowitz, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and Edwidge Danticat. The jazz saxophonist David Murray performed a musical tribute.

== Politics, literary reception, and legacy ==
=== Politics ===

Morrison spoke openly about American politics and race relations.

In writing about the 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton, she claimed that since Whitewater, Bill Clinton was being mistreated in the same way Black people often are:
The phrase &quot;our first Black president&quot; was adopted as a positive by Bill Clinton supporters. When the Congressional Black Caucus honored the former president at its dinner in Washington, D.C., on September 29, 2001, for instance, Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX), the chair, told the audience that Clinton &quot;took so many initiatives he made us think for a while we had elected the first black president&quot;.

In the context of the 2008 Democratic Primary campaign, Morrison stated to &quot;Time&quot; magazine: &quot;People misunderstood that phrase. I was deploring the way in which President Clinton was being treated, vis-à-vis the sex scandal that was surrounding him. I said he was being treated like a black on the street, already guilty, already a perp. I have no idea what his real instincts are, in terms of race.&quot; In the Democratic primary contest for the 2008 presidential race, Morrison endorsed Senator Barack Obama over Senator Hillary Clinton, though expressing admiration and respect for the latter. When he won, Morrison said she felt like an American for the first time. She said, &quot;I felt very powerfully patriotic when I went to the inauguration of Barack Obama. I felt like a kid.&quot;

In April 2015, speaking of the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Walter Scott – three unarmed Black men killed by white police officers – Morrison said: &quot;People keep saying, &#x27;We need to have a conversation about race.&#x27; This is the conversation. I want to see a cop shoot a white unarmed teenager in the back. And I want to see a white man convicted for raping a Black woman. Then when you ask me, &#x27;Is it over?&#x27;, I will say yes.&quot;

After the 2016 election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, Morrison wrote an essay, &quot;Mourning for Whiteness&quot;, published in the November 21, 2016 issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. In it she argues that white Americans are so afraid of losing privileges afforded them by their race that white voters elected Trump, whom she described as being &quot;endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan&quot;, in order to keep the idea of white supremacy alive.

=== Relationship to feminism ===
Although her novels typically concentrate on black women, Morrison did not identify her works as feminist. When asked in a 1998 interview, &quot;Why distance oneself from feminism?&quot; she replied: &quot;In order to be as free as I possibly can, in my own imagination, I can&#x27;t take positions that are closed. Everything I&#x27;ve ever done, in the writing world, has been to expand articulation, rather than to close it, to open doors, sometimes, not even closing the book – leaving the endings open for reinterpretation, revisitation, a little ambiguity.&quot; She went on to state that she thought it &quot;off-putting to some readers, who may feel that I&#x27;m involved in writing some kind of feminist tract. I don&#x27;t subscribe to patriarchy, and I don&#x27;t think it should be substituted with matriarchy. I think it&#x27;s a question of equitable access, and opening doors to all sorts of things.&quot;

In 2012, she responded to a question about the difference between black and white feminists in the 1970s. &quot;Womanists is what black feminists used to call themselves&quot;, she explained. &quot;They were not the same thing. And also the relationship with men. Historically, black women have always sheltered their men because they were out there, and they were the ones that were most likely to be killed.&quot;

W. S. Kottiswari writes in &quot;Postmodern Feminist Writers&quot; (2008) that Morrison exemplifies characteristics of &quot;postmodern feminism&quot; by &quot;altering Euro-American dichotomies by rewriting a history written by mainstream historians&quot; and by her usage of shifting narration in &quot;Beloved&quot; and &quot;Paradise&quot;. Kottiswari states: &quot;Instead of western logocentric abstractions, Morrison prefers the powerful vivid language of women of color ... She is essentially postmodern since her approach to myth and folklore is re-visionist.&quot;

=== Contributions to Black feminism ===
Many of Toni Morrison&#x27;s works have been cited by scholars as significant contributions to Black feminism, reflecting themes of race, gender, and sexual identity within her narratives.

Barbara Smith&#x27;s 1977 essay &quot;Toward a Black Feminist Criticism&quot; argues that Toni Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Sula&quot; is a work of Black feminism, as it presents a lesbian perspective that challenges heterosexual relationships and the conventional family unit. Smith states, “Consciously or not, Morrison&#x27;s work poses both lesbian and feminist questions about Black women&#x27;s autonomy and their impact upon each other&#x27;s lives.&quot;

Hilton Als&#x27;s 2003 profile in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; notes that “Before the late sixties, there was no real Black Studies curriculum in the academy—let alone a post-colonial-studies program or a feminist one. As an editor and author, Morrison, backed by the institutional power of Random House, provided the material for those discussions to begin.”

Toni Morrison consistently advocated for feminist ideas that challenge the dominance of the white patriarchal system, frequently rejecting the notion of writing from the perspective of the &quot;white male gaze.&quot; Feminist political activist Angela Davis notes that “Toni Morrison&#x27;s project resides precisely in the effort to discredit the notion that this white male gaze must be omnipresent.” 

In a 1998 episode of &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;, Toni Morrison responded to a review of &quot;Sula&quot;, stating, “I remember a review of &quot;Sula&quot; in which the reviewer said, &#x27;One day, she,&#x27; meaning me, &#x27;will have to face up &#x27;to the real responsibilities, and get mature, &#x27;and write about the real confrontation &#x27;for black people, which is white people.&#x27; As though our lives have no meaning and no depth without the white gaze, and I have spent my entire writing life trying to make sure that the white gaze was not the dominant one in any of my books.”

In a 2015 interview with &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, Toni Morrison reiterated her intention to write without the white gaze, stating, “What I’m interested in is writing without the gaze, without the white gaze. In so many earlier books by African-American writers, particularly the men, I felt that they were not writing to me. But what interested me was the African-American experience throughout whichever time I spoke of. It was always about African-American culture and people — good, bad, indifferent, whatever — but that was, for me, the universe.”

Regarding the racial environment in which she wrote, Toni Morrison stated, “Navigating a white male world was not threatening. It wasn’t even interesting. I was more interesting than they were. I knew more than they did. And I wasn’t afraid to show it.”

In a 1986 interview with Sandi Russell, Toni Morrison stated that she wrote primarily for Black women, explaining, “I write for black women. We are not addressing the men, as some white female writers do. We are not attacking each other, as both black and white men do. Black women writers look at things in an unforgiving/loving way. They are writing to repossess, re-name, re-own.” 

In a 2003 interview, when asked about the labels &quot;black&quot; and &quot;female&quot; being attached to her work, Toni Morrison replied, &quot;I can accept the labels because being a black woman writer is not a shallow place but a rich place to write from. It doesn’t limit my imagination; it expands it. It’s richer than being a white male writer because I know more and I’ve experienced more.”

In a 1987 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Toni Morrison argued for the greatness of being a Black woman, stating, “I really think the range of emotions and perceptions I have had access to as a black person and as a female person are greater than those of people who are neither. I really do. So it seems to me that my world did not shrink because I was a black female writer. It just got bigger.&quot;

=== National Memorial for Peace and Justice ===

The National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama, includes writing by Morrison. Visitors can see her quote after they have walked through the section commemorating individual victims of lynching.

=== Papers ===
The Toni Morrison Papers are part of the permanent library collections of Princeton University, where they are held in the Manuscripts Division, Department of Rare Books and Special Collections. Morrison&#x27;s decision to offer her papers to Princeton instead of to her alma mater Howard University was criticized by some within the historically black colleges and universities community.

Opening in February 2023, an exhibition titled &quot;Toni Morrison: Sites of Memory&quot;, which was curated from her archives at Princeton University, commemorated the 30th anniversary of her winning the Nobel Prize. Running from the week after her birthday until June 4, the exhibition featured rare manuscripts, correspondence between Morrison and others, and unfinished projects, taking its name from a 1995 essay by Morrison in which she spoke of a &quot;journey to a site to see what remains were left behind and to reconstruct the world that these remains imply.&quot;

=== Day and halls ===

In 2019, a resolution was passed in her hometown of Lorain, Ohio, to designate February 18, her birthday, as Toni Morrison Day. Additional legislation was introduced to also proclaim that date as &quot;Toni Morrison Day&quot; throughout the State of Ohio. The legislation, HB 325, was passed by the Ohio House of Representatives on December 2, 2020, and signed into law by Governor Mike DeWine on December 21.

In 2021, Cornell University opened Toni Morrison Hall, a 178,869 square-foot residence hall and Morrison Dining in 2022, an adjacent dining hall designed by ikon.5 Architects.

During December 2023, the Toni Morrison Collective at Cornell University to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Morrison&#x27;s Nobel win partnered with Calvary Baptist Church to give away free copies of two of Morrison&#x27;s books and hold book talks in various locations. As explained by Anne V. Adams, professor emerita of Africana studies and comparative literature and chair of the Toni Morrison Collective: “The fact that Toni Morrison, during her first year as a master’s student, lodged at a house just a couple of doors up the street from historic Calvary Baptist Church created a perfect context for a collaboration.&quot;

== Documentary films ==
Morrison was interviewed by Margaret Busby in London for a 1988 documentary film by Sindamani Bridglal, entitled &quot;Identifiable Qualities&quot;, shown on Channel 4.

Morrison was the subject of a film titled &quot;Imagine – Toni Morrison Remembers&quot;, directed by Jill Nicholls and shown on BBC One television on July 15, 2015, in which Morrison talked to Alan Yentob about her life and work.

In 2016, Oberlin College received a grant to complete a documentary film begun in 2014, &quot;The Foreigner&#x27;s Home&quot;, about Morrison&#x27;s intellectual and artistic vision, explored in the context of the 2006 exhibition she guest-curated at the Louvre. The film&#x27;s executive producer was Jonathan Demme. It was directed by Oberlin College Cinema Studies faculty Geoff Pingree and Rian Brown, and incorporates footage shot by Morrison&#x27;s first-born son Harold Ford Morrison, who also consulted on the film.

In 2019, Timothy Greenfield-Sanders&#x27; documentary &quot;Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Those featured in the film include Morrison, Angela Davis, Oprah Winfrey, Fran Lebowitz, Sonia Sanchez, and Walter Mosley, among others.

<text>The Color Purple is a 1982 epistolary novel by American author Alice Walker that won the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the National Book Award for Fiction. 

The novel has been the target of censors numerous times, and appears on the American Library Association list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 2000–2010 at number seventeen because of the sometimes explicit content, particularly in terms of violence. In 2003, the book was listed on the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read poll of the UK&#x27;s &quot;best-loved novels.&quot;

The novel has been adapted into various other media, including feature films in 1985 and 2023, a 2005 musical, and a 2008 radio serial on &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; on BBC Radio 4.

== Plot ==

Celie, a poor African-American girl, lives in rural Georgia in the early 1900s. She writes letters to God because her father Alphonso beats and rapes her. Due to the rape, she gives birth to two children, Olivia and Adam, whom Alphonso takes away. A farmer identified as &quot;Mister&quot; (Mr.__) asks to marry her younger sister Nettie, but Alphonso offers him Celie instead. Celie is abused by Mister and mistreated by his prior children. Nettie runs away and stays with Celie, but Mister eventually makes her leave after she refuses his unwanted sexual advances. Nettie promises to write, but Celie never receives any letters, and Celie concludes that she is dead.

Mister&#x27;s son Harpo marries an assertive girl named Sofia. Celie is impressed by Sofia&#x27;s self-esteem, but Mister chides Harpo for what he considers weakness in his treatment of Sofia. In a moment of envy, Celie tells Harpo to beat Sofia. Sofia fights back and confronts Celie, who apologizes and confides in her about Mister&#x27;s abuse.

Shug Avery, a jazz and blues singer and Mister&#x27;s long-time mistress, moves in. Celie takes care of Shug, who is ill. While Shug is initially rude to Celie, the two become friends and Celie becomes infatuated with Shug. Frustrated by Harpo&#x27;s domineering behavior, Sofia moves out, taking her children with her. Several months later, Harpo opens a juke joint where a fully recovered Shug performs nightly. Shug learns that Mister beats Celie, and vows to stay at the house until she is convinced he will stop. Shug and Celie grow closer and the women make love.

Shug tells Celie to go with her and they can be together as girlfriends and live freely. The day of Shug&#x27;s departure arrives and Celie packs her bags and is about to leave with her but she is caught by Mister and Shug leaves while Celie suffers from the departure of her beloved and fears what awaits her now with Mister.

Sofia returns for a visit and gets into a fight with Harpo&#x27;s new girlfriend, Squeak. She has a verbal spat with the mayor&#x27;s wife, Miss Millie, and after the mayor slaps her, she hits him back. She is beaten by the police and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Squeak tricks the warden, her white uncle, into releasing Sofia from prison and having her work as Miss Millie&#x27;s maid. The plan works, but the warden rapes Squeak. Sofia is released from prison and forced to work for Miss Millie, which she detests. Squeak cares for Sofia&#x27;s children, and the two women become friends. 

Shug returns to town, newly married to a man called Grady. Together, they learn that Mister has hidden letters from Nettie for years. In the letters, Nettie says she has befriended a missionary couple, Samuel and Corrine, and gone to Africa with them. Samuel and Corrine had unwittingly adopted Adam and Olivia. Through Samuel&#x27;s story of the adoption, Nettie learns that Alphonso is her and Celie&#x27;s stepfather. Their biological father was lynched, and their mother then suffered a mental collapse that Alphonso exploited. Nettie confesses to Samuel and Corrine that she is the children&#x27;s biological aunt. Corrine, gravely ill, refuses to believe Nettie until Nettie reminds her that she had previously met Celie. Later, Corrine dies, having accepted Nettie&#x27;s story. 

Celie visits Alphonso, who confirms Nettie&#x27;s story. Celie confides to Shug that she is losing faith in God; Shug explains to Celie her own unique religious philosophy. Celie, Shug and Squeak decide to leave town; Celie curses Mister before leaving him. They settle in Memphis, Tennessee; Celie starts a pants-making business.

Alphonso dies. Celie inherits land that rightfully should have been passed down to her and Nettie because it belonged to her biological father and mother. She moves back into her childhood home. Celie is crushed when Shug falls in love with Germaine, a member of her band. Shug travels with Germaine, writing postcards to Celie. Celie pledges to love Shug even if Shug does not love her back. Celie learns that Mister is suffering from a considerable decline in fortunes, and begins calling him by his first name, Albert. Mister proposes that they marry &quot;in the spirit as well as in the flesh&quot;, but Celie declines.

Nettie and Samuel marry and prepare to return to America. Before they leave, Adam marries Tashi, an African girl. Following tradition, Tashi undergoes female genital mutilation and facial scarring. In solidarity, Adam undergoes the same facial scarring ritual.

As Celie realizes that she is content without Shug, Shug returns, having ended her relationship with Germaine. Nettie, Samuel, Olivia, Adam and Tashi arrive at Celie&#x27;s house. Nettie and Celie reunite after 30 years, introducing one another to their respective families.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;The Color Purple&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1983, making Walker the first black woman to win for fiction; in 1950 Gwendolyn Brooks had won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry. Walker also won the National Book Award for Fiction in 1983. Mel Watkins of the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; wrote that it is a &quot;striking and consummately well-written novel&quot;, praising its powerful emotional impact and epistolary structure. It was also named a PBS Great American Read Top 100 Pick.

The book received greater scrutiny amidst controversy surrounding the release of the film adaptation in 1985. The controversy centered around the depiction of black men, which some critics saw as feeding stereotypical narratives of black male violence, while others found the representation compelling and relatable.

On November 5, 2019, the &quot;BBC News&quot; listed &quot;The Color Purple&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

=== Censorship in the United States ===
Though the novel has garnered critical acclaim, it has also been the subject of controversy. The American Library Association placed it on the list of top hundred banned and challenged books in the United States from 1990 to 1999 (17), 2000 to 2009 (17), and 2010 to 2019 (50), as well as the top ten list for 2007 (6) and 2009 (9). Commonly cited justifications for banning the book include sexual explicitness, explicit language, violence, and homosexuality.

==Adaptations==

The novel was adapted into a film of the same name in 1985. It was directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Whoopi Goldberg as Celie, Danny Glover as Albert, and Oprah Winfrey as Sofia. Though nominated for eleven Academy Awards, it won none. This perceived snubbing ignited controversy because many critics, including Roger Ebert, considered it the best picture of the year.

On December 1, 2005, a musical adaptation of the novel and film with lyrics and music by Stephen Bray, Brenda Russell and Allee Willis, and book by Marsha Norman opened at The Broadway Theatre in New York City. The show was produced by Scott Sanders, Quincy Jones, Harvey Weinstein, and Oprah Winfrey, who was also an investor.

In 2008, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a radio adaptation of the novel in ten 15-minute episodes as a &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; serial with Nadine Marshall as Celie, Nikki Amuka-Bird, Nina Sosanya and Eamonn Walker. The script was by Patricia Cumper and in 2009 the production received the Sony Radio Academy Awards Silver Drama Award.

In 2018, Warner Bros. announced that they would be releasing a new film adaptation of &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, based on the musical. Spielberg and Quincy Jones returned to produce this version, along with the stage musical&#x27;s producers Scott Sanders and Oprah Winfrey. The film opened on December 25, 2023.

==Boycotting Israel==
As part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS), the author declined publication of the book in Israel in 2012. This decision was criticized by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, who argued that Walker &quot;resorted to bigotry and censorship against Hebrew-speaking readers of her writings&quot;. In a letter to Yediot Books, Walker stated that she would not allow her book to be published in Israel while the country maintained its system of apartheid.

<text>The Chaetognatha or chaetognaths (meaning &quot;bristle-jaws&quot;) are a phylum of predatory marine worms that are a major component of plankton worldwide. Commonly known as arrow worms, they are mostly nektonic; however about 20% of the known species are benthic, and can attach to algae and rocks. They are found in all marine waters, from surface tropical waters and shallow tide pools to the deep sea and polar regions. Most chaetognaths are transparent and are torpedo shaped, but some deep-sea species are orange. They range in size from .

Chaetognaths were first recorded by the Dutch naturalist Martinus Slabber in 1775. As of 2021, biologists recognize 133 modern species assigned to over 26 genera and eight families. Despite the limited diversity of species, the number of individuals is large.

Arrow worms are strictly related to and possibly belonging to Gnathifera, a clade of protostomes that do not belong to either Ecdysozoa or Lophotrochozoa.

==Anatomy==

Chaetognaths are transparent or translucent dart-shaped animals covered by a cuticle. They range in length between 1.5 mm to 105 mm in the Antarctic species &quot;Pseudosagitta gazellae&quot;. Body size, either between individuals in the same species or between different species, seems to increase with decreasing temperature. The body is divided into a distinct head, trunk, and tail. About 80% of the body is occupied by primary longitudinal muscles. 

===Head and digestive system===
There are between four and fourteen hooked, grasping spines on each side of their head, flanking a hollow vestibule containing the mouth. The spines are used in hunting, and covered with a flexible hood arising from the neck region when the animal is swimming. Spines and teeth are made of α-chitin, and the head is protected by a chitinous armature. 

The mouth opens into a muscular pharynx, which contains glands to lubricate the passage of food. From here, a straight intestine runs the length of the trunk to an anus just forward of the tail. The intestine is the primary site of digestion and includes a pair of diverticula near the anterior end. Materials are moved about the body cavity by cilia. Waste materials are simply excreted through the skin and anus. Eukrohniid species possess an oil vacuole closely associated with the gut. This organ contains wax esters which may assist reproduction and growth outside of the production season for &quot;Eukrohnia hamata&quot; in Arctic seas. Owing to the position of the oil vacuole in the center of the tractus, the organ may also have implications for buoyancy, trim and locomotion.

Usually chaetognaths are not pigmented, however the intestines of some deep-sea species contain orange-red carotenoid pigments. 

===Nervous and sensory systems===
The nervous system is reasonably simple and shows a typical protostome anatomy, consisting of a ganglionated nerve ring surrounding the pharynx. The brain is composed of two distinct functional domains: the anterior neuropil domain and the posterior neuropil domain. The former probably controls head muscles moving the spines and the digestive system. The latter is linked to eyes and the corona ciliata. A putative sensory structure of unknown function, the retrocerebral organ, is also hosted by the posterior neuropil domain. The ventral ganglion is the largest, but nerves extend from all the ganglia along the length of the body. 

Chaetognaths have two compound eyes, each consisting of a number of pigment-cup ocelli fused together; some deep-sea and troglobitic species have unpigmented or absent eyes. In addition, there are a number of sensory bristles arranged in rows along the side of the body, where they probably perform a function similar to that of the lateral line in fish. An additional, curved, band of sensory bristles lies over the head and neck. Almost all chaetognaths have &quot;indirect&quot; or &quot;inverted&quot; eyes, according to the orientation of photoreceptor cells; only some Eukhroniidae species have &quot;direct&quot; or &quot;everted&quot; eyes. A unique feature of the chaetognath eye is the lamellar structure of photoreceptor membranes, containing a grid of 35–55 nm wide circular pores.

A significant mechanosensory system, composed of ciliary receptor organs, detects vibrations, allowing chaetognaths to detect the swimming motion of potential prey. Another organ on the dorsal part of the neck, the corona ciliata, is probably involved in chemoreception.

===Internal organs===
The body cavity is lined by peritoneum, and therefore represents a true coelom, and is divided into one compartment on each side of the trunk, and additional compartments inside the head and tail, all separated completely by septa. Although they have a mouth with one or two rows of tiny teeth, compound eyes, and a nervous system, they have no excretory or respiratory systems. While often said to lack a circulatory system, chaetognaths do have a rudimentary hemal system resembling those of annelids.

The arrow worm rhabdomeres are derived from microtubules 20 nm long and 50 nm wide, which in turn form conical bodies that contain granules and thread structures. The cone body is derived from a cilium.

===Locomotion===
The trunk bears one or two pairs of lateral fins incorporating structures superficially similar to the fin rays of fish, with which they are not homologous. Unlike those of vertebrates, these lateral fins are composed of a thickened basement membrane extending from the epidermis. An additional caudal fin covers the post-anal tail. Two chaetognath species, &quot;Caecosagitta macrocephala&quot; and &quot;Eukrohnia fowleri&quot;, have bioluminescent organs on their fins. 

Chaetognaths swim in short bursts using a dorso-ventral undulating body motion, where their tail fin assists with propulsion and the body fins with stabilization and steering. Muscle movements have been described as among the fastest in metazoans. Muscles are directly excitable by electrical currents or strong K+ solutions; the main neuromuscular transmitter is acetylcholine.

==Reproduction and life cycle==
All species are hermaphroditic, carrying both eggs and sperm. Each animal possesses a pair of testes within the tail, and a pair of ovaries in the posterior region of the main body cavity. Immature sperm are released from the testes to mature inside the cavity of the tail, and then swim through a short duct to a seminal vesicle where they are packaged into a spermatophore.

During mating, each individual places a spermatophore onto the neck of its partner after rupture of the seminal vesicle. The sperm rapidly escape from the spermatophore and swim along the midline of the animal until they reach a pair of small pores just in front of the tail. These pores connect to the oviducts, into which the developed eggs have already passed from the ovaries, and it is here that fertilisation takes place. The seminal receptacles and oviducts accumulate and store spermatozoa, to perform multiple fertilisation cycles. Some benthic members of Spadellidae are known to have elaborate courtship rituals before copulation, for example &quot;Paraspadella gotoi&quot;.

The eggs are mostly planktonic, except in a few species such as &quot;Ferosagitta hispida&quot; that attaches eggs to the substrate. In &quot;Eukrohnia&quot;, eggs develop in marsupial sacs or attached to algae. Eggs usually hatch after 1–3 days. Chaetognaths do not undergo metamorphosis nor they possess a well-defined larval stage, an unusual trait among marine invertebrates; however there are significant morphological differences between the newborn and the adult, with respect to proportions, chitinous structures and fin development. 

The life spans of chaetognaths are variable but short; the longest recorded was 15 months in &quot;Sagitta friderici&quot;.

==Behaviour==
Little is known of arrow worms&#x27; behaviour and physiology, due to the complexity in culturing them and reconstructing their natural habitat. It is known that they feed more frequently with higher temperatures. Planktonic chaetognaths often must swim continuously, with a &quot;hop and sink&quot; behaviour, to keep themselves in the desired location in the water layer, and swim actively to catch prey. They all tend to keep the body slightly slanted with the head pointing downwards. They often show a &quot;gliding&quot; behaviour, slowly sinking for a while, and then catching up with a quick movement of their fins. Benthic species usually stay attached to substrates such as rocks, algae or sea grasses, more rarely on top or between sand grains, and act more strictly as ambush predators, staying still until prey passes by. The prey is detected thanks to the ciliary fence and tuft organs, sensing vibrations – individuals of &quot;Spadella cephaloptera&quot; for example will attack a glass or metal probe vibrating at an adequate frequency. To catch prey, arrow worms jump forward with a strong stroke of the tail fin. Once in contact with prey, they withdraw the hood over the grasping spines, so that it forms a cage around the prey and bring it in contact with the mouth. They swallow their prey whole.

==Ecology==
Chaetognaths are found in all world&#x27;s oceans, from the poles to tropics, and also in brackish and estuarine waters. They inhabit very diverse environments, from hydrothermal vents to deep ocean seafloor, to seagrass beds and marine caves. The majority are planktonic, and they are often the second most common component of zooplankton, with a biomass ranging between 10 and 30% that of copepods. In the Canada Basin, chaetognaths alone represent ~13% of the zooplankton biomass. As such, they are ecologically relevant and a key food source for fishes and other predators, including commercially relevant fishes such as mackerel or sardines. 58% of known species are pelagic, while about a third of species are epibenthic or meiobenthic, or inhabit the immediate vicinity of the substrate. Chaetognaths have been recorded up to 5000 and possibly even 6000 meters of depth. 

The highest density of chaetognaths is observed in the photic zone of shallow waters. Larger chaetognath species tend to live deeper in water, but spend their juvenile stages higher in the water column. Arrow worms however engage in diel vertical migration, spending the day at lower depths to avoid predators, and coming close to the surface at night. Their position in the water column can depend on light, temperature, salinity, age and food supply. They cannot swim against oceanic currents, and they are used as a hydrological indicator of currents and water masses. 

All chaetognaths are ambush predators, preying on other planktonic animals, mostly copepods and cladocerans but also amphipods, krill and fish larvae. Adults can feed on younger individuals of the same species. Some species are also reported to be omnivores, feeding on algae and detritus. 
Chaetognaths are known to use the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin to subdue prey, possibly synthesized by &quot;Vibrio&quot; bacterial species.

==Genetics==
===Mitochondrial genome===
The mtDNA of the arrow worm &quot;Spadella cephaloptera&quot; has been sequenced in 2004, and at the time it was the smallest metazoan mitochondrial genome known, being 11,905 base pairs long (it has now been surpassed by the mitchondrial genome of the ctenophore &quot;Mnemiopsis leidyi&quot;, which is 10,326 bp long). All mitochondrial tRNA genes are absent. The MT-ATP8 and MT-ATP6 genes are also missing. The mtDNA of &quot;Paraspadella gotoi&quot;, also sequenced in 2004, is even smaller (11,403 bp) and it shows a similar pattern, lacking 21 of the 22 usually present tRNA genes and featuring only 14 of the 37 genes normally present. 

Chaetognaths show a unique mitochondrial genomic diversity within individual of the same species.

== Phylogeny ==

===External===
The evolutionary relationships of chaetognaths have long been enigmatic. Charles Darwin remarked that arrow worms were &quot;remarkable for the obscurity of their affinities&quot;. Chaetognaths in the past have been traditionally, but erroneously, classed as deuterostomes by embryologists due to deuterostome-like features in the embryo. Lynn Margulis and K. V. Schwartz placed chaetognaths in the deuterostomes in their &quot;Five Kingdom&quot; classification. However, several developmental features are at odds with deuterostomes and are either akin to Spiralia or unique to Chaetognatha.


Molecular phylogeny shows that Chaetognatha are, in fact, protostomes. Thomas Cavalier-Smith places them in the protostomes in his &quot;Six Kingdom&quot; classification. The similarities between chaetognaths and nematodes mentioned above may support the protostome thesis—in fact, chaetognaths are sometimes regarded as a basal ecdysozoan or lophotrochozoan. Chaetognatha appears close to the base of the protostome tree in most studies of their molecular phylogeny. This may explain their deuterostome embryonic characters. If chaetognaths branched off from the protostomes before they evolved their distinctive protostome embryonic characters, they might have retained deuterostome characters inherited from early bilaterian ancestors. Thus chaetognaths may be a useful model for the ancestral bilaterian.
Studies of arrow worms&#x27; nervous systems suggests they should be placed within the protostomes. According to 2017 and 2019 papers, chaetognaths either belong to or are the sister group of Gnathifera.

===Internal===
Below is a consensus evolutionary tree of extant Chaetognatha, based on both morphological and molecular data, as of 2021.

== Fossil record ==
Due to their soft bodies, chaetognaths fossilize poorly. Even so, several fossil chaetognath species have been described. Chaetognaths first appear during the Cambrian Period. Complete body fossils have been formally described from the Lower Cambrian Maotianshan shales of Yunnan, China (&quot;Eognathacantha ercainella&quot; Chen &amp; Huang and &quot;Protosagitta spinosa&quot; Hu) and the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia (&quot;Capinatator praetermissus&quot;.) A Cambrian stem-group chaetognath, &quot;Timorebestia&quot;, first described in 2024, was much larger than modern species, showing that chaetognaths occupied different roles in marine ecosystems compared to today. A more recent chaetognath, &quot;Paucijaculum samamithion&quot; Schram, has been described from the Mazon Creek biota from the Pennsylvanian of Illinois. 
Chaetognaths were thought possibly to be related to some of the animals grouped with the conodonts. The conodonts themselves, however, have been shown to be dental elements of vertebrates. It is now thought that protoconodont elements (e.g., &quot;Protohertzina anabarica&quot; Missarzhevsky, 1973), are probably grasping spines of chaetognaths rather than teeth of conodonts. Previously chaetognaths in the Early Cambrian were only suspected from these protoconodont elements, but the more recent discoveries of body fossils have confirmed their presence then. There is evidence that chaetognaths were important components of the oceanic food web already in the Early Cambrian.

==History==
The first known description of a chaetognath has been published by Dutch naturalist Martinus Slabber in the 1770s; he also coined the name &quot;arrow worm&quot;. The zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville also briefly mentioned probable chaetognaths but he understood them as pelagic mollusks. The first description of a currently accepted species of chaetognath, &quot;Sagitta bipunctata&quot;, is from 1827. Among the early zoologists describing arrow worms, there is Charles Darwin, who took notes about them during the voyage of the &quot;Beagle&quot; and in 1844 dedicated a paper to them. In the following year, August David Krohn published an early anatomical description of &quot;Sagitta bipunctata&quot;.

The term &quot;chaetognath&quot; has been coined in 1856 by Rudolf Leuckart. He was also the first to propose that the genus &quot;Sagitta&quot; belonged to a separate group: «At the moment, it seems most natural to regard the Sagittas as representatives of a small group of their own that makes the transition from the real annelids (first of all the lumbricines) to the nematodes, and may not be unsuitably named Chaetognathi.»

The modern systematics of Chaetognatha begins in 1911 with Ritter-Záhony and is later consolidated by Takasi Tokioka in 1965 and Robert Bieri in 1991. Tokioka introduced the orders Phragmophora and Aphragmophora, and classified four families, six genera, for a total of 58 species – plus the extinct &quot;Amiskwia&quot;, classified as a true primitive chaetognath in a separate class, Archisagittoidea.

Chaetognaths were for a while considered as belonging or affine to the deuterostomes, but suspects of their affinities among Spiralia or other protostomes were already present as early as 1986. Their affinities with protostomes were clarified in 2004 by sequencing and analysis of mtDNA.

== Infection by giant viruses ==

In 2018, reanalysis of electron microscopy photographs from the 1980s allowed scientists to identify a giant virus (&quot;Meelsvirus&quot;) infecting &quot;Adhesisagitta hispida&quot;; its site of multiplication is nuclear and the virions (length: 1.25 μm) are enveloped. In 2019, reanalysis of other previous studies has shown that structures that were taken in 1967 for bristles present on the surface of the species &quot;Spadella cephaloptera&quot;, and in 2003, for bacteria infecting &quot;Paraspadella gotoi&quot;, were in fact enveloped and spindle-shaped giant viruses with a cytoplasmic site of multiplication. The viral species infecting &quot;P. gotoi&quot;, whose maximum length is 3.1 μm, has been named &quot;Klothovirus casanovai&quot; (&quot;Klotho&quot; being the Greek name for one of the three Fates whose attribute was a spindle, and &quot;casanovai&quot;, in tribute to Pr J.-P. Casanova who devoted a large part of his scientific life to the study of chaetognaths). The other species has been named &quot;Megaklothovirus horridgei&quot; (in tribute to Adrian Horridge, the first author of the 1967 article). On a photograph, one of the viruses &quot;M. horridgei&quot;, although truncated, is 3.9 μm long, corresponding to about twice the length of the bacteria &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. Many ribosomes are present in virions but their origin remains unknown (cellular, viral or only partly viral). To date, giant viruses known to infect metazoans are exceptionally rare.

<doc id="43173" wikidata="Q12902524" url="?curid=43173" title="Marine worm">
<text>Any worm that lives in a marine environment is considered a water worm. Marine worms are found in several different phyla, including the Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Annelida (segmented worms), Chaetognatha, Hemichordata, and Phoronida. For a list of marine animals that have been called &quot;sea worms&quot;, see sea worm.

==Reproduction==
Marine worms exhibit numerous types of reproduction, both sexually and asexually. Asexually many are able to reproduce via budding or regeneration. This regeneration is most notably studied in Plathelminths or Triclad, known for being one of the earliest animals to be studied for its regenerative capabilities. Marine worms will also sexually reproduce, internally and externally, with some releasing spawn into the ocean currents. This is in opposition to the much more internal and invasive method displayed by flat-worms called Penis fencing where hermaphroditic organisms will flight to try and impregnate their opponent while avoiding becoming impregnated. This method is driven by the biological disadvantages (such as resource need and energy expenditure) behind carrying offspring instead of the more prolific gene passage through multiple impregnations.

==Genetics and taxonomy==
Polynoid scale worms are estimated to have arrived in deep sea ecosystems around sixty million years ago. Through the comparison of 120 genes, researchers came to the conclusion that genes related to DNA repair, recombination, and integration were only present in the deep sea polynoidae, which correlates with the idea that they have to adapt to deal with potential hypoxia in deep sea environments.

==Feeding methods==
Marine worms can be herbivores, carnivores, parasites, detritivores, or filter feeders, but many strange examples of feeding are seen in this diverse type of animal. The group of Siboglinidae have developed a relationship with symbiotic bacteria within their gut that often perform chemosynthesis from which the worm benefits. These bacteria reside in a specialized organ called the Trophosome. Some worms have an extendable pharynx or a proboscis for consuming prey, while others have developed jaws.

==Circulation==
Marine worms have a variety of circulation and respiration processes. For example, in platyhelminths this is achieved through diffusion of oxygen (as well as other nutrients) across a moist epithelial layer, whereas annelids have a closed circulatory system with blood vessels lining the body.

Many of these worms have specialized tentacles used for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide which also may be used for reproduction. These specialized tentacles allow for gas exchange, further decreasing oxygen content in dead zones and in shallow water, which encourages plant and algae growth.

This quality is also observed in deeper oceans, where tube worms that use respiratory plumes with tentacles perform gas exchange of hydrogen sulfide and methane around hydrothermal vents. These types of circulatory systems differ from marine worms previously mentioned that can perform gas exchange through their entire bodies. This synapomorphy of gas exchange causes even related terrestrial annelids to be restricted to moist environments.

==Environmental niches==
Marine worms are known to inhabit many different environments, having been found in both fresh and saltwater habitats globally.

Some marine worms are tube worms, of which the giant tube worm lives in waters near underwater volcanoes and can withstand temperatures up to 90 °C (194 °F). They share this space with fellow polychaetas known as &quot;pompeii worms&quot; that can resist 105 °C waters coming out of vents for short periods of time, making them one of the most heat resistant animals ever recorded (Islam and Schulze-Makuch,2007).

Some worms can live in extremely deep oceanic trenches, such as in the Pacific Ocean off the Galápagos Islands.

Marine deep sea polychaetes under the genus &quot;Osedax&quot; will colonize at whale falls in many different oceans, using a symbiont that can digest the bones within the carcasses (Jones et al,2007) This earned them the common name of &quot;boneworms,&quot; and they are speculated to be a keystone species of these types of environments due to lack of organisms in whale falls without observed &quot;Osedax&quot; worms. These whale falls remain undigested for many more years than those observed with marine worm cultivations.

In recent years, marine worms (especially those found in the ocean) have been observed ingesting microplastic particles found in the oceans. This trend is concerning many scientists, as marine worms act as an important food source for many fish and wading birds. Marine worms are often keystone species in an ecosystem, and the introduction of plastic in the oceans not only diminishes the growth rates of the marine worms, but also affects the food chain of that ecosystem.

<doc id="43174" wikidata="Q15104453" url="?curid=43174" title="Cloudinidae">
<text>The cloudinids, an early metazoan family containing the genera Acuticocloudina, Cloudina and Conotubus, lived in the late Ediacaran period about 550 million years ago and became extinct at the base of the Cambrian. They formed millimetre-scale conical fossils consisting of calcareous cones nested within one another; the appearance of the organism itself remains unknown. The name &quot;Cloudina&quot; honors the 20th-century geologist and paleontologist Preston Cloud.

Cloudinids comprise two genera: &quot;Cloudina&quot; itself is mineralized, whereas &quot;Conotubus&quot; is at best weakly mineralized, whilst sharing the same &quot;funnel-in-funnel&quot; construction.

Cloudinids had a wide geographic range, reflected in the present distribution of localities in which their fossils are found, and are an abundant component of some deposits. They never appear in the same layers as soft-bodied Ediacaran biota, but the fact that some sequences contain cloudinids and Ediacaran biota in alternating layers suggests that these groups had different environmental preferences. It has been suggested that cloudinids lived embedded in microbial mats, growing new cones to avoid being buried by silt. However no specimens have been found embedded in mats, and their mode of life is still an unresolved question.

The classification of the cloudinids has proved difficult: they were initially regarded as polychaete worms, and then as coral-like cnidarians on the basis of what look like buds on some specimens. Current scientific opinion is divided between classifying them as polychaetes and regarding it as unsafe to classify them as members of any broader grouping. In 2020, a new study of pyritized specimens from the Wood Canyon Formation in Nevada showed the presence of Nephrozoan type guts, the oldest on record, supporting the bilaterian interpretation.

Cloudinids are important in the history of animal evolution for two reasons. They are among the earliest and most abundant of the small shelly fossils with mineralized skeletons, and therefore feature in the debate about why such skeletons first appeared in the Late Ediacaran. The most widely supported answer is that their shells are a defense against predators, as some &quot;Cloudina&quot; specimens from China bear the marks of multiple attacks, which suggests they survived at least a few of them. The holes made by predators are approximately proportional to the size of the &quot;Cloudina&quot; specimens, and &quot;Sinotubulites&quot; fossils, which are often found in the same beds, have so far shown no such holes. These two points suggest that predators attacked in a selective manner, and the evolutionary arms race which this indicates is commonly cited as a cause of the Cambrian explosion of animal diversity and complexity.

==Morphology==

&quot;Cloudina&quot; varies in size from a diameter of 0.3 to 6.5 mm, and 8 to 150 mm in length. Fossils consist of a series of stacked vase-like calcite tubes, whose original mineral composition is unknown, but inferred to be high-magnesium calcite. Each cone traps a significant pore space beneath it, and stacks eccentrically in the one below. This results in a ridged external appearance. The overall tube is curved or sinuous, and occasionally branches. The tube walls are 8 to 50 micrometers thick, usually lying in the range 10 to 25 μm. Although it used to be thought that the tubes had test-tube like bases, detailed three-dimensional reconstruction has shown that the tubes had an open base. There is evidence that the tube was flexible.

==Classification==
&quot;Cloudina&quot; was originally classified in 1972 as a member of the Cribricyathea, a class known from the Early Cambrian. Glaessner (1976) accepted this classification and also
proposed that &quot;Cloudina&quot; was similar to the annelid worms, particularly serpulid polychaetes. However, Hahn &amp; Pflug (1985) and Conway Morris &quot;et al.&quot;. (1990) doubted both Germs&#x27; and Glaessner&#x27;s suggested relationships, and were unwilling to classify it to anything more than its own family, Cloudinidae. Some specimens of &quot;Cloudina hartmannae&quot; display budding, which implies asexual reproduction. On this basis Grant (1990) classified &quot;Cloudina&quot; as a coral-like cnidarian. Since the tubes had an open base, creating a single living space rather than a series of separate chambers, &quot;Cloudina&quot; is more likely to be a stem group polychaete worm, in other words an evolutionary &quot;aunt&quot; or &quot;cousin&quot; of more recent polychaetes. This interpretation is reinforced by the even distribution of bore-holes made by predators. However, as with so many Ediacaran life forms, there is great debate surrounding its position in the tree of life, and classification between the kingdom and family level may be unwise.
==Ecology==

&quot;Cloudina&quot; is frequently found in association with stromatolites, which are limited to shallow water; their isotopic composition suggests that water temperatures were relatively cool. They have also been found in normal sea-floor sediments, suggesting that they were not only restricted to dwelling on microbial mounds. On the other hand, &quot;Cloudina&quot; has never been found in the same layers as the soft-bodied Ediacara biota, but &quot;Cloudina&quot; and Ediacara biota have been found in alternating layers. This suggests that the two groups of organisms had different environmental preferences.

In many &quot;Cloudina&quot; specimens the ridges formed by the cones are of varying width, which suggests the organisms grew at a variable rate. Adolf Seilacher suggests that they adhered to microbial mats, and that the growth phases represented the organism keeping pace with sedimentation—growing through new material deposited on it that would otherwise bury it. Kinks in the developing tube are easily explained by the mat falling slightly from the horizontal. Because of its small size, &quot;Cloudina&quot; would be expected to be found &quot;in situ&quot; in the microbial mat, especially if, as Seilacher suggests, sedimentation built up around it during its lifetime. But all the many specimens discovered to date have only been found having been washed out of their places of growth. A further argument against Seilacher&#x27;s hypothesis is that the predatory borings found in many specimens are not concentrated at what would be the top end, as one would expect if the animal was mainly buried. An alternative is that the organism dwelt on seaweeds, but until a specimen unquestionably &quot;in situ&quot; is discovered, its mode of life remains open to debate.

The tubes often appear to form colonies, although they are sometimes found in more isolated situations. The frequent appearance of large and sometimes single-species colonies has been attributed to the lack of significant predation. On the other hand, in some locations up to 20% of &quot;Cloudina&quot; fossils contain predatory borings ranging from 15 to 400 μm in diameter. The boreholes are rather evenly distributed along the tube length, and some tubes had been bored multiple times—hence the organism could survive attacks, since predators do not attack empty shells. This may indicate that the animal could vary its position in the tube in response to predation, or that it occupied the full length—but not the full width—of the tube. The even distribution is perhaps difficult to reconcile with an infaunal lifestyle, mainly buried in a microbial mat, and adds weight to Miller&#x27;s suggestion that the animal lived on seaweeds or in a reef environment. If modern-day molluscs are a suitable analogy, the size distribution of the borings suggests that the predator was similar in size to &quot;Cloudina&quot;.

Fossil findings in the Nama Group, Namibia, suggest that &quot;Cloudina&quot; was one of the first reef-building animals, but machine-learning facilitated 3D tomography indicates that the &#x27;reef-forming&#x27; fossils are in fact simply aggregations of solitary individuals.

==Fossil locations==
&quot;Cloudina&quot; occurred in calcium carbonate rich areas of stromatolite reefs. It is found in association with &quot;Namacalathus&quot;, which like &quot;Cloudina&quot; was &quot;weakly skeletal&quot; and solitary, and &quot;Namapoikia&quot;, which was &quot;robustly skeletal&quot; and formed sheets on open surfaces.

First found in the Nama Group in Namibia, &quot;Cloudina&quot; has also been reported in Oman, China&#x27;s Dengying Formation, Canada, Uruguay, Argentina, Antarctica, Brazil, Nevada, central Spain, northwest Mexico and California,
in west and south Siberia. The &quot;Cloudina&quot; fossils found in association with late Precambrian-Early Cambrian anabaritids SSF and tubular agglutinated skeletal fossils &quot;Platysolenites&quot; and &quot;Spirosolenites&quot; in Siberia.
==Paleontological importance==
Although not the first small shelly fossil to be found, &quot;Cloudina&quot; is one of the earliest and most abundant. The evolution of external shells in the Late Ediacaran is thought to be a defence against predators, marking the start of an evolutionary arms race. While predatory borings are common in &quot;Cloudina&quot; specimens, no such borings have been found in &quot;Sinotubulites&quot;, a similar shelly fossil sometimes found in the same beds. In addition, the diameters of borings in &quot;Cloudina&quot; are proportional to the sizes of specimens, which suggests that predators were selective about the size of their prey. These two indications that predators attacked selectively suggest the possibility of speciation in response to predation, which is often postulated as a potential cause of the rapid diversification of animals in the Early Cambrian.

<text>Conodonts (Greek &quot;kōnos&quot;, &quot;cone&quot;, + &quot;odont&quot;, &quot;tooth&quot;) are an extinct group of jawless vertebrates, classified in the class Conodonta. They are primarily known from their hard, mineralised tooth-like structures called &quot;conodont elements&quot; that in life were present in the oral cavity and used to process food. Rare soft tissue remains suggest that they had elongate eel-like bodies with large eyes. Conodonts were a long-lasting group with over 300 million years of existence from the Cambrian (over 500 million years ago) to the beginning of the Jurassic (around 200 million years ago). Conodont elements are highly distinctive to particular species and are widely used in biostratigraphy as indicative of particular periods of geological time.

== Discovery and understanding of conodonts ==
The teeth-like fossils of the conodont were first discovered by Heinz Christian Pander and the results published in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in 1856.

It was only in the early 1980s that the first fossil evidence of the rest of the animal was found (see below). In the 1990s exquisite fossils were found in South Africa in which the soft tissue had been converted to clay, preserving even muscle fibres. The presence of muscles for rotating the eyes showed definitively that the animals were primitive vertebrates.

=== Nomenclature and taxonomic rank ===
Through their history of study, &quot;conodont&quot; is a term which has been applied to both the individual fossils and to the animals to which they belonged. The original German term used by Pander was &quot;conodonten&quot;, which was subsequently anglicized as &quot;conodonts&quot;, though no formal latinized name was provided for several decades. MacFarlane (1923) described them as an order, Conodontes (a Greek translation), which Huddle (1934) altered to the Latin spelling Conodonta. A few years earlier, Eichenberg (1930) established another name for the animals responsible for conodont fossils: Conodontophorida (&quot;conodont bearers&quot;). A few other scientific names were rarely and inconsistently applied to conodonts and their proposed close relatives during 20th century, such as Conodontophoridia, Conodontophora, Conodontochordata, Conodontiformes, and Conodontomorpha.

Conodonta and Conodontophorida are by far the most common scientific names used to refer to conodonts, though inconsistencies regarding their taxonomic rank still persist. Bengtson (1976)&#x27;s research on conodont evolution identified three morphological tiers of early conodont-like fossils: protoconodonts, paraconodonts, and &quot;true conodonts&quot; (euconodonts). Further investigations revealed that protoconodonts were probably more closely related to chaetognaths (arrow worms) rather than true conodonts. On the other hand, paraconodonts are still considered a likely ancestral stock or sister group to euconodonts.

The 1981 &quot;Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology&quot; volume on the conodonts (Part W revised, supplement 2) lists Conodonta as the name of both a phylum and a class, with Conodontophorida as a subordinate order for &quot;true conodonts&quot;. All three ranks were attributed to Eichenberg, and Paraconodontida was also included as an order under Conodonta. This approach was criticized by Fåhraeus (1983), who argued that it overlooked Pander&#x27;s historical relevance as a founder and primary figure in conodontology. Fåhraeus proposed to retain Conodonta as a phylum (attributed to Pander), with the single class Conodontata (Pander) and the single order Conodontophorida (Eichenberg). Subsequent authors continued to regard Conodonta as a phylum with an ever-increasing number of subgroups.

With increasingly strong evidence that conodonts lie within the phylum Chordata, more recent studies generally refer to &quot;true conodonts&quot; as the class Conodonta, containing multiple smaller orders. Paraconodonts are typically excluded from the group, though still regarded as close relatives. In practice, Conodonta, Conodontophorida, and Euconodonta are equivalent terms and are used interchangeably.

== Conodont elements ==
For a long time, the function and arrangement of conodont elements was enigmatic, since the whole animal was soft-bodied, with the sole exception of the mineralized elements. Upon the conodont animal&#x27;s demise, the soft tissues would decompose and the individual conodont elements would separate. However, in instances of exceptional preservation the conodont elements may be recovered in articulation. By closely observing these rare specimens, Briggs &quot;et al&quot;. (1983) were able to for the first time study the anatomy of the complexes formed by the conodont elements arranged as they were in life. Other researchers have continued to revise and reinterpret this initial description.

=== Lone elements ===
Conodont elements consist of mineralised teeth-like structures of varying morphology and complexity. The evolution of mineralized tissues has been puzzling for more than a century. It has been hypothesized that the first mechanism of chordate tissue mineralization began either in the oral skeleton of conodonts or the dermal skeleton of early agnathans.

The element array constituted a feeding apparatus that is radically different from the jaws of modern animals. They are now termed &quot;conodont elements&quot; to avoid confusion. The three forms of teeth, i.e., coniform cones, ramiform bars, and pectiniform platforms, probably performed different functions.

For many years, conodonts were known only from enigmatic tooth-like microfossils (200 micrometers to 5 millimeters in length), which occur commonly, but not always, in isolation and were not associated with any other fossil. Until the early 1980s, conodont teeth had not been found in association with fossils of the host organism, in a konservat lagerstätte. This is because the conodont animal was soft-bodied, thus everything but the teeth was unsuited for preservation under normal circumstances.

These microfossils are made of hydroxylapatite (a phosphatic mineral). The conodont elements can be extracted from rock using adequate solvents.

They are widely used in biostratigraphy. Conodont elements are also used as paleothermometers, a proxy for thermal alteration in the host rock, because under higher temperatures, the phosphate undergoes predictable and permanent color changes, measured with the conodont alteration index. This has made them useful for petroleum exploration where they are known, in rocks dating from the Cambrian to the Late Triassic.

=== Full apparatus ===
The conodont apparatus may comprise a number of discrete elements, including the spathognathiform, ozarkodiniform, trichonodelliform, neoprioniodiform, and other forms.

In the 1930s, the concept of conodont assemblages was described by Hermann Schmidt and by Harold W. Scott in 1934.

==== Element types ====

The arrangement of elements in ozarkodinids and other complex conodonts was first reconstructed from extremely well-preserved taxa by Briggs &quot;et al.&quot; (1983), although loosely articulated conodont elements are reported as early as 1971. Conodont elements are organized into three different groups based upon shape. These groups of shapes are termed S, M, and P elements.

The S and M elements are ramiform, elongate, and comb-like structures. An individual element has a single row of many cusps running down the midline along its top side. These conodont elements are arranged towards the animal&#x27;s anterior oral surface, forming an interlocking basket of cusps within the mouth. Cusp may point out towards the head of the animal, or back towards the tail. The number of S and M elements present as well as the direction they point may vary by taxonomic group. M (makellate) elements have a higher position in the mouth and commonly form a symmetrical shape akin to a horseshoe or pick. S elements are further divided into three subtypes:

* S element - an unpaired symmetrical ramiform structure at the front of the mouth. Sometimes known as an S0 element.
* S element - paired asymmetrical structures
* S element - paired highly asymmetrical, bipennate structures

In P elements, a pectiniform (comb-shaped) row of cusps transitions into a broad flat or ridged platform moving towards the base of the element. Platforms and cusps are only found along one side of the structure. Individual elements oriented vertically and arranged in pairs, with platforms and cusps pointing towards the animal&#x27;s midline. They occur deeper in the throat than the S and M elements. P elements are further divided into two subtypes:

* Pa element - blade-like structures
* Pb element - arched structures

== The conodont animal ==
Although conodont elements are abundant in the fossil record, fossils preserving soft tissues of conodont animals are known from only a few deposits in the world. One of the first possible body fossils of a conodont were those of &quot;Typhloesus&quot;, an enigmatic animal known from the Bear Gulch limestone in Montana. This possible identification was based on the presence of conodont elements with the fossils of &quot;Typhloesus&quot;. This claim was disproved, however, as the conodont elements were actually in the creature&#x27;s digestive area. That animal is now regarded as a possible mollusk related to gastropods. As of 2023, there are only three described species of conodonts that have preserved trunk fossils: &quot;Clydagnathus windsorensis&quot; from the Carboniferous aged Granton Shrimp Bed in Scotland, &quot;Promissum pulchrum&quot; from the Ordovician aged Soom Shale in South Africa, and &quot;Panderodus unicostatus&quot; from the Silurian aged Waukesha Biota in Wisconsin. There are other examples of conodont animals that only preserve the head region, including eyes, of the animals known from the Silurian aged Eramosa site in Ontario and Triassic aged Akkamori section in Japan.

According to these fossils, conodonts had large eyes, fins with fin rays, chevron-shaped muscles and axial line, which were interpreted as notochord or the dorsal nerve cord. While &quot;Clydagnathus&quot; and &quot;Panderodus&quot; had lengths only reaching , &quot;Promissum&quot; is estimated to reach in length, if it had the same proportions as &quot;Clydagnathus&quot;.

== Ecology ==

=== Diet ===
Because they are associated with the oral region of the conodont animal, it is accepted that conodont elements are used in the acquisition of food. Two primary hypotheses have arisen as to how this is accomplished. One hypothesis proposed that elements acted as support structures for filamentous soft-tissues. These small filaments (cilia) would be used to filter small planktonic organisms out of the water column, analogous to the cnidoblast cells of a coral or the lophophore of a brachiopod.

Another hypothesis contests that the conodont elements were used to actively catch and process prey. S and M elements could have been independently movable, allowing prey to be captured in the oral region of the animal. Modern hagfish and lampreys scrape at flesh using keratinous blades supported by a simple but effective pulley-like system, involving a string of muscles around a cartilaginous core. An equivalent system might have been present in conodonts. S and M elements would be able to open and close at will to firmly grasp or pinch at prey, before rotating back to consume the prey element. The blade-like P elements deeper in the throat would process the food by slicing against their counterparts like a pair of scissors, or grinding against each other like molar teeth.

Current consensus supports the latter hypothesis in which elements are used for predation, not suspension feeding. One line of evidence for this includes the isometric growth pattern exhibited by S, M, and P elements. If the conodont animal relied upon a filter feeding strategy then this growth pattern would not provide the necessary surface area needed to support ciliated tissue as the animal grew. There is some evidence for cartilaginous structures similar to those present in modern jawless fish, which are both predators and scavengers. Wear on some conodont elements suggests that they functioned like teeth, with both wear marks likely created by food as well as by occlusion with other elements.

It is possible that multiple feeding strategies may have arisen in different groups of conodonts, as they are a diverse clade. A 2009 paper suggested that the genus &quot;Panderodus&quot; may have utilized venom in the acquisition of prey. Evidence of longitudinal grooves are present on some conodont elements associated with the feeding apparatus of this particular animal. These sorts of grooves are analogous to those present in some extant groups of venomous vertebrates.

=== Lifestyle ===
Studies have concluded that conodonts taxa occupied both pelagic (open ocean) and nektobenthic (swimming above the sediment surface) niches. The preserved musculature suggests that some conodonts (&quot;Promissum&quot; at least) were efficient cruisers, but incapable of bursts of speed. Based on isotopic evidence, some Devonian conodonts have been proposed to have been low-level consumers that fed on zooplankton.

A study on the population dynamics of &quot;Alternognathus&quot; has been published. Among other things, it demonstrates that at least this taxon had short lifespans lasting around a month. A study Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios of a population of conodonts from a carbonate platform from the Silurian of Sweden found that the different conodont species and genera likely occupied different trophic niches.

== Classification and phylogeny ==

=== Affinities ===
, scientists classify the conodonts in the phylum Chordata on the basis of their fins with fin rays, chevron-shaped muscles and notochord.

Milsom and Rigby envision them as vertebrates similar in appearance to modern hagfish and lampreys, and phylogenetic analysis suggests they are more derived than either of these groups. However, this analysis comes with one caveat: the earliest conodont-like fossils, the protoconodonts, appear to form a distinct clade from the later paraconodonts and euconodonts. Protoconodonts are probably not relatives of true conodonts, but likely represent a stem group to Chaetognatha, an unrelated phylum that includes arrow worms.

Moreover, some analyses do not regard conodonts as either vertebrates or craniates, because they lack the main characteristics of these groups. More recently it has been proposed that conodonts may be stem-cyclostomes, more closely related to hagfish and lampreys than to jawed vertebrates.

=== Ingroup relations ===
Individual conodont elements are difficult to classify in a consistent manner, but an increasing number of conodont species are now known from multi-element assemblages, which offer more data to infer how different conodont lineages are related to each other. The following is a simplified cladogram based on Sweet and Donoghue (2001), which summarized previous work by Sweet (1988) and Donoghue et al. (2000):

Only a few studies approach the question of conodont ingroup relationships from a cladistic perspective, as informed by phylogenetic analyses. One of the broadest studies of this nature was the analysis of Donoghue et al. (2008), which focused on &quot;complex&quot; conodonts (Prioniodontida and other descendant groups):

== Evolutionary history ==
The earliest fossils of conodonts are known from the Cambrian period. Conodonts extensively diversified during the early Ordovician, reaching their apex of diversity during the middle part of the period, and experienced a sharp decline during the late Ordovician and Silurian, before reaching another peak of diversity during the mid-late Devonian. Conodont diversity declined during the Carboniferous, with an extinction event at the end of the middle Tournaisian and a prolonged period of significant loss of diversity during the Pennsylvanian. Only a handful of conodont genera were present during the Permian, though diversity increased after the P-T extinction during the Early Triassic.

Diversity continued to decline during the Middle and Late Triassic, culminating in their extinction soon after the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. Much of their diversity during the Paleozoic was likely controlled by sea levels and temperature, with the major declines during the Late Ordovician and Late Carboniferous due to cooler temperatures, especially glacial events and associated marine regressions which reduced continental shelf area. However, their final demise is more likely related to biotic interactions, perhaps competition with new Mesozoic taxa.

<text>Gnathostomulids, or jaw worms, are a small phylum of nearly microscopic marine animals. They inhabit sand and mud beneath shallow coastal waters and can survive in relatively anoxic environments. They were first recognised and described in 1956.

==Anatomy==
Most gnathostomulids measure in length. They are often slender to thread-like worms, with a generally transparent body. In many Bursovaginoidea, one of the major group of gnathostomulids, the neck region is slightly narrower than the rest of the body, giving them a distinct head.

Like flatworms they have a ciliated epidermis, but in contrast to flatworms, they have one cilium per cell. The cilia allow the worms to glide along in the water between sand grains, although they also use muscles, allowing the body to twist or contract, for movement.

They have no body cavity, and no circulatory or respiratory system. The nervous system is simple, and restricted to the outer layers of the body wall. The only sense organs are modified cilia, which are especially common in the head region.

The mouth is located just behind the head, after a rostrum, on the underside of the body. It has a pair of cuticular jaws, supplied by strong muscles, and often bearing minute teeth. A &quot;basal plate&quot; on the lower surface that bears a comb-like structure is also present. The basal plate is used to scrape smaller organisms off of the grains of sand that make up their anoxic seabed mud habitat. This bilaterally symmetrical pharynx with its complex cuticular mouth parts make them appear closely related to rotifers and their allies, together making up the Gnathifera. The ultrastructure of the jaws made of rods with electron dense core in transmission electron microscopy sections also support their close relation with Rotifera and Micrognathozoa. The mouth opens into a blind-ending tube in which digestion takes place; there is no true anus. However, there is tissue connecting the intestine to the epidermis which may serve as an anal pore.

==Reproduction==
Gnathostomulids are simultaneous hermaphrodites. Each individual possesses a single ovary and one or two testes. After fertilization, the single egg ruptures through the body wall and adheres to nearby sand particles; the parent is able to rapidly heal the resulting wound. The egg hatches into a miniature version of the adult, without a larval stage.

==Taxonomy==

There are approximately 100 described species and certainly many more as yet undescribed. The known species are grouped in two orders. The filospermoids are very long and are characterized by an elongate rostrum. The bursovaginoids have paired sensory organs and are characterized by the presence of a penis and a sperm-storage organ called a bursa.

Gnathostomulids have no known fossil record, though there are (debatable) similarities between the jaws of modern gnathostomulids and certain conodont elements. (Ochietti &amp; Cailleux, 1969; Durden et al, 1969)

They appear to be a sister clade to the Syndermata.

<text>Stanley Jordan (born July 31, 1959) is an American jazz guitarist noted for his playing technique, which involves tapping his fingers on the fretboard of the guitar with both hands.

== Music career ==
Jordan was born in Chicago, Illinois, United States. When he was six, he started on piano, then at eleven switched to guitar. He later began playing in rock and soul bands. In 1976, he won an award at the Reno Jazz Festival. At Princeton University, he studied music theory and composition with Milton Babbitt and computer music with Paul Lansky. He also took freshman calculus with Edward Nelson. While at Princeton, he played also with Benny Carter and Dizzy Gillespie.

In 1985, Bruce Lundvall became president of Blue Note Records and Stanley Jordan was the first person he signed. The label released his album &quot;Magic Touch&quot;, which sat at No.1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s jazz chart for 51 weeks, setting a record.

=== Touch technique ===
Normally, a guitarist uses two hands to play each note. One hand presses down a guitar string behind a chosen fret to prepare the note, and the other hand either plucks or strums the string to play that note. Jordan&#x27;s touch technique is an advanced form of two-handed tapping. The guitarist produces a note using only one finger by quickly tapping (or hammering) his finger down on the appropriate fret. The impact causes the string to vibrate enough to sound the note, and the volume can be controlled by varying the force of impact. Jordan taps with both hands, and more legato than is normally associated with guitar tapping. His technique allows the guitarist to play melody and chords simultaneously. It is also possible, as he has demonstrated, to play simultaneously on two different guitars, as well as guitar and piano.

He plays guitar in all-fourths tuning, from bass to treble EADGCF (all in perfect fourths as on the bass guitar) rather than the standard EADGBE. He has stated that all-fourths tuning &quot;simplifies the fingerboard, making it logical&quot;.

Jordan&#x27;s main guitar was built by Vigier Guitars in 1984: it is an Arpege model on which Vigier made a flat fingerboard, allowing it to have a very low action (0.5/0.7mm). The low action facilitates the tapping technique.

=== Recording ===
Among the artists Jordan has worked with are Quincy Jones, Stanley Clarke, Onaje Allan Gumbs, Michal Urbaniak, Richie Cole, The Dave Matthews Band, The String Cheese Incident, Phil Lesh, Moe, and Umphrey&#x27;s McGee.

He has performed at many jazz festivals, including Kool Jazz Festival (1984), Concord Jazz Festival (1985), and the Montreux International Jazz Festival (1985).

In 2004, he released the album &quot;Dreams of Peace&quot; with the Italian band Novecento. The album was produced by Lino Nicolosi and Pino Nicolosi at Nicolosi Productions and was released in the U.S. on Favored Nations. He signed with Mack Avenue Records and released &quot;State of Nature&quot; in 2008 and &quot;Friends&quot; in 2011. The latter was nominated for an NAACP Image Award. He has four Grammy nominations.
Jordan made the startup sound for the Macintosh computer models the Power Macintosh 6100, Power Macintosh 7100, and Power Macintosh 8100.

=== Film and television ===
Jordan made a cameo appearance in the movie &quot;Blind Date&quot; (1987). In 1995 he wrote the score for the short film &quot;One Red Rose&quot;. In 1996 he wrote the score for the ABC TV afternoon special, &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Girl&quot;.

Since the mid-1980s he has performed on numerous television shows, including &quot;The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot; and &quot;the Grammy Awards&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Stanley Jordan was briefly married and has one daughter, Julia Jordan, who is a singer and songwriter.

In a 2023 interview, Jordan praised author and then-presidential candidate Marianne Williamson for &quot;bringing politics into the 21st-century&quot;.

<doc id="43183" wikidata="Q921087" url="?curid=43183" title="Hyolitha">
<text>Hyoliths are animals with small conical shells, known from fossils from the Palaeozoic era. They are at least considered as being lophotrochozoan, and possibly being lophophorates, a group which includes the brachiopods (hyoliths may even be brachiopods themselves), while others consider them as being basal lophotrochozoans, or even molluscs.

==Morphology==
The shell of a hyolith is typically one to four centimeters in length, triangular or elliptical in cross section. Some species have rings or stripes. It comprises two parts: the main conical shell (previously referred to as a ‘conch’) and a cap-like operculum. Some also had two curved supports known as &quot;helens&quot; They are calcareous – probably aragonitic All of these structures grew by marginal accretion.

=== Shell microstructure===
The orthothecid shell has an internal layer with a microstructure of transverse bundles, and an external layer comprising longitudinal bundles.

=== Helens ===
Some hyoliths had helens, long structures that taper as they coil gently in a logarithmic spiral in a ventral direction. The helens had an organic-rich central core surrounded by concentric laminae of calcite. They grew by the addition of new material at their base, on the cavity side, leaving growth lines.

They were originally described by Walcott as separate fossils under the genus name &quot;Helenia&quot;, (Walcott&#x27;s wife was named Helena and his daughter Helen); Bruce Runnegar adopted the name helen when they were recognized as part of the hyolith organism. Encrusting organisms have been found on helens, and also on both sides of the main shell, all of which are therefore supposed to have been raised above the sea bed. The helens have been interpreted as props that supported the feeding organ, the lophophore, above the sea bed.

=== Operculum ===
The operculum closes over the aperture of the shell, leaving (in hyolithids) two gaps through which the helens can protrude. It comprises two parts: the cardinal shield, a flat region at the top of the shell; and the conical shield, the bottom part, which is more conical. The inside of the shell bears a number of protrusions, notably the dorsal cardinal processes and the radially-arranged clavicles.
===Soft tissues===
The soft tissues of the mid-Cambrian hyolith &quot;Haplophrentis&quot;, from the Burgess Shale and Spence Shale Lagerstätten include a gullwing-shaped band below the operculum. This band is interpreted as a lophophore, a feeding organ with a central mouth; it bears 12 to 16 tentacles. From the mouth a muscular pharynx leads to a gut, which loops back and exits beyond the crown of tentacles. Next to the gut are a pair of large kidney-shaped organs of uncertain nature. Under the operculum are muscles. The thin body wall circumscribes the interior of the shell, except the apex. Preserved intestines have been described from the Ordovician hyolith &quot;Girvanolithes thraivensis&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
The hyoliths are divided into two orders, the Hyolithida and the Orthothecida.

Hyolitha have dorso-ventrally differentiated opercula, with the ventral surface of the shell extending forwards to form a shelf termed the ligula.

The Orthothecida are somewhat more problematic, and probably contain a number of non-hyoliths simply because they are so difficult to identify with confidence, especially if their operculum is absent. They have a straight (planar) opening, sometimes with a notch on the bottom side, and sealed with an operculum that has no ligula, clavicles, furrow or rooflets.

&quot;Hyptiotheca&quot; is an unusual hyolithid, in that it lacks clavicles.

Orthothecids fall into two groups: one, the orthothecida &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, is kidney or heart shaped in cross-section due to a longitudinal groove on its ventral surface, and its opercula bear cardinal processes; the other has a rounded cross-section and often lacks cardinal processes, making them difficult to distinguish from other cornet-shaped calcareous organisms. All were sessile and benthic; some may have been filter feeders.

== Phylogenetic position ==

Because hyoliths are extinct and do not obviously resemble any extant group, it has long been unclear which living group they are most closely related to. They have been supposed to be molluscs; or to belong to their own phylum in an unspecified part of the tree of life. Their grade of organization was historically considered to be of the &#x27;mollusc-annelid-sipunculid&#x27; level, consistent with a Lophotrochozoan affinity, and comparison was primarily drawn with the molluscs or sipunculids. Older studies (predating the Lophotrochozoan concept) consider hyoliths to represent a stem lineage of the clade containing (Mollusca + Annelida + Arthropoda).

A secure classification at last became possible in 2017, on the basis of Burgess Shale specimens that preserve lophophores. This diagnostic characteristic demonstrates an affinity with the Lophophorata, a group that contains Brachiopoda, Bryozoa (perhaps), and Phoronida.

A study in 2019 estimated that hyoliths are more likely to be basal members of the lophotrochozoans rather than lophophorates. Meanwhile, a study in 2020 instead concluded that hyoliths belong to Mollusca, as did a different study in 2022.

== Ecology ==
Hyolithids were benthic (bottom-dwellers), using their helens as stilts to hold the opening of their shells above the sea floor. Orthothecids did not have helens, but are presumed to have been sessile and benthic.

In the Cambrian, their global distribution shows no sign of provinciality, suggesting a long-lived planktonic larval life stage (reflected by their protoconchs); but by the Ordovician distinct assemblages were becoming evident.

Some orthothecids are preserved in vertical [life] orientation, suggesting a sessile suspension-feeding habit; hyolithids tend to be flat on the bottom, and their shape and the occurrence of epibionts are consistent with a sessile suspension feeding habit via orientation relative to passive currents.

==Occurrence==
The first hyolith fossils appeared about in the &quot;Purella antiqua&quot; Zone of the Nemakit-Daldynian Stage of Siberia and in its analogue the &quot;Paragloborilus subglobosus–Purella squamulosa&quot; Zone of the Meishucunian Stage of China. Hyolith abundance and diversity attain a maximum in the Cambrian, followed by a progressive decline up to their Permian extinction.

== Similar organisms ==
Due to the simple shape of their shell, hyoliths have been something of a wastebasket taxon, and organisms originally interpreted as hyoliths have sometimes later been recognized as something else – as for example in the case of the cnidarian-like &quot;Glossolites&quot; and &quot;Palaeoconotuba&quot;.

<text>Lobopodians are members of the informal group Lobopodia (), or the formally erected phylum Lobopoda Cavalier-Smith (1998). They are panarthropods with stubby legs called lobopods, a term which may also be used as a common name of this group as well. While the definition of lobopodians may differ between literatures, it usually refers to a group of soft-bodied, marine worm-like fossil panarthropods such as &quot;Aysheaia&quot; and &quot;Hallucigenia&quot;. However, other genera like &quot;Kerygmachela&quot; and &quot;Pambdelurion&quot; (which have features similar to other groups) are often referred to as “gilled lobopodians”. 

The oldest near-complete fossil lobopodians date to the Lower Cambrian; some are also known from Ordovician, Silurian and Carboniferous Lagerstätten. Some bear toughened claws, plates or spines, which are commonly preserved as carbonaceous or mineralized microfossils in Cambrian strata. The grouping is considered to be paraphyletic, as the three living panarthropod groups (Arthropoda, Tardigrada and Onychophora) are thought to have evolved from lobopodian ancestors.

== Definitions ==
The Lobopodian concept varies from author to author. Its most general sense refers to a suite of mainly Cambrian worm-like panarthropod taxa possessing lobopods – for example, &quot;Aysheaia&quot;, &quot;Hallucigenia&quot;, and &quot;Xenusion&quot; – which were traditionally united as &quot;Xenusians&quot; or &quot;Xenusiids&quot; (class Xenusia). Certain Dinocaridid genera, such as &quot;Opabinia&quot;, &quot;Pambdelurion&quot;, and &quot;Kerygmachela&quot;, may also be regarded as lobopodians, sometimes referred to more specifically as &quot;gilled lobopodians&quot; or &quot;gilled lobopods&quot;. This traditional, informal usage of &quot;Lobopodia&quot; treats it as an evolutionary grade, including only extinct Panarthropods near the base of crown Panarthropoda. Crown Panarthropoda comprises the three extant Panarthropod phyla – Onychophora (velvet worms), Tardigrada (waterbears), and Arthropoda (arthropods) – as well as their most recent common ancestor and all of its descendants. Thus, in this usage, Lobopodia consists of various basal Panarthropods. This corresponds to &quot;A&quot; in the image to the left.

An alternative, broader definition of Lobopodia would also incorporate Onychophora and Tardigrada, the two living panarthropod phyla which still bear lobopodous limbs. This definition, corresponding to &quot;C&quot;, is a morphological one, depending on the superficial similarity of appendages (the &quot;lobopods&quot;). Thus, it is paraphyletic, excluding the Euarthropods, which are descendants of certain Lobopodians, on the basis of their highly divergent limb morphology. &quot;Lobopodia&quot; has also been used to refer to a proposed sister clade to Arthropoda, consisting of the extant Onychophora and Tardigrada, as well as their most recent common ancestor and all of its descendants. This definition renders Lobopodia a monophyletic taxon, if indeed it is valid (that is, if Tardigrades and Onychophora are closer to one another than either is to Arthropoda), but would exclude all the Euarthropod-line taxa traditionally considered Lobopodians. Its validity is uncertain, however, as there are a number of hypotheses regarding the internal phylogeny of Panarthropoda. The broadest definition treats Lobopodia as a monophyletic superphylum equivalent in circumscription to Panarthropoda. By this definition, represented by &quot;D&quot; in the image, Lobopodia is no longer treated as an evolutionary grade but as a clade, containing not only the early, superficially &quot;Lobopodian&quot; forms but also all of their descendants, including the extant Panarthropods.

Lobopodia has, historically, sometimes included Pentastomida, a group of parasitic panarthropod which were traditionally thought to be a unique phylum, but revealed by subsequent phylogenomic and anatomical studies to be a highly specialized taxon of crustaceans.

==Representative taxa==

The better-known genera include &quot;Aysheaia&quot;, which was discovered in the Canadian Burgess Shale, and &quot;Hallucigenia&quot;, known from both the Chenjiang Maotianshan Shale and the Burgess Shale. &quot;Aysheaia pedunculata&quot; has a morphology apparently basic for lobopodians — for example, a significantly annulated cuticle, a terminal mouth opening, specialized frontalmost appendages, and stubby lobopods with terminal claws. &quot;Hallucigenia sparsa&quot; is famous for having a complex history of interpretation — it was originally reconstructed with long, stilt-like legs and mysterious fleshy dorsal protuberances, and was long considered a prime example of the way in which nature experimented with the most diverse and bizarre body designs during the Cambrian. However, further discoveries showed that this reconstruction had placed the animal upside-down: interpreting the &quot;stilts&quot; as dorsal spines made it clear that the fleshy &quot;dorsal&quot; protuberances were actually elongated lobopods. More recent reconstruction even exchanged the front and rear ends of the animal: it was revealed that the bulbous imprint previously thought to be a head was actually gut contents being expelled from the anus.

&quot;Microdictyon&quot; is another charismatic as well as the speciose genus of lobopodians resembling &quot;Hallucigenia&quot;, but instead of spines, it bore pairs of net-like plates, which are often found disarticulated and are known as an example of small shelly fossils (SSF). &quot;Xenusion&quot; has the oldest fossil record amongst the described lobopodians, which may trace back to Cambrian Stage 2. &quot;Luolishania&quot; is an iconic example of lobopodians with multiple pairs of specialized appendages. The gill lobopodians &quot;Kerygmachela&quot; and &quot;Pambdelurion&quot; shed light on the relationship between lobopodians and arthropods, as they have both lobopodian affinities and characteristics linked to the arthropod stem-group.

==Morphology==

Most lobopodians were only a few centimeters in length, while some genera grew up to over 20 centimeters. Their bodies are annulated, although the presence of annulation may differ between position or taxa, and sometimes difficult to discern due to their close spacing and low relief on the fossil materials. Body and appendages are circular in cross-section.

=== Head ===
Due to the usually poor preservation, detailed reconstructions of the head region are only available for a handful of lobopodian species. The head of a lobopodian is more or less bulbous, and sometime possesses a pair of pre-ocular, presumely protocerebral appendages – for example, primary antennae or well-developed frontal appendages, which are individualized from the trunk lobopods (with the exception of &quot;Antennacanthopodia&quot;, which have two pairs of head appendages instead of one). Mouthparts may consist of rows of teeth or a conical proboscis. The eyes may be represented by a single ocellus or by numerous pairs of simple ocelli, as has been shown in &quot;Luolishania&quot; (=&quot;Miraluolishania&quot;), &quot;Ovatiovermis&quot;, &quot;Onychodictyon&quot;, &quot;Hallucigenia&quot;, &quot;Facivermis&quot;, and less certainly &quot;Aysheaia&quot; as well. However, in gilled lobopodians like &quot;Kerygmachela&quot;, the eyes are relatively complex reflective patches that may had been compound in nature.

=== Trunk and lobopods ===
The trunk is elongated and composed of numerous body segments (somites), each bearing a pair of legs called lobopods or lobopodous limbs. The segmental boundaries are not as externally significant as those of arthropods, although they are indicated by heteronomous annulations (i.e., the alternation of annulation density corresponding to the position of segmental boundaries) in some species. The trunk segments may bear other external, segment-corresponding structures such as nodes (e.g. &quot;Hadranax&quot;, &quot;Kerygmachela&quot;), papillae (e.g. &quot;Onychodictyon&quot;), spine/plate-like sclerites (e.g. armoured lobopodians) or lateral flaps (e.g. gilled lobopodians). The trunk may terminate with a pair of lobopods (e.g. &quot;Aysheaia&quot;, &quot;Hallucigenia sparsa&quot;) or a tail-like extension (e.g. &quot;Paucipodia&quot;, &quot;Siberion&quot;, &quot;Jianshanopodia&quot;).

The lobopods are flexible and loosely conical in shape, tapering from the body to tips that may or may not bear claws. The claws, if present, are hardened structures with a shape resembling a hook or gently-curved spine. Claw-bearing lobopods usually have two claws, but single claws are known (e.g. posterior lobopods of luolishaniids), as are more than two (e.g. three in &quot;Tritonychus&quot;, seven in &quot;Aysheaia&quot;) depending on its segmental or taxonomical association. In some genera, the lobopods bear additional structures such as spines (e.g. &quot;Diania&quot;), fleshy outgrowths (e.g. &quot;Onychodictyon&quot;), or tubercules (e.g. &quot;Jianshanopodia&quot;). There is no sign of arthropodization (development of a hardened exoskeleton and segmental division on panarthropod appendages) in known members of lobopodians, even for those belonging to the arthropod stem-group (e.g. gilled lobopodians and siberiids), and the suspected case of arthropodization on the limbs of &quot;Diania&quot; is considered to be a misinterpretation.

Differentiation (tagmosis) between trunk somites barely occurs, except in hallucigenids and luolishaniids, where numerous pairs of their anterior lobopods are significantly slender (hallucigenids) or setose (luolishaniids) in contrast to their posterior counterparts.

=== Internal structures ===

The gut of lobopodians is often straight, undifferentiated, and sometimes preserved in the fossil record in three dimensions. In some specimens the gut is found to be filled with sediment. The gut consists of a central tube occupying the full length of the lobopodian&#x27;s trunk, which does not change much in width - at least not systematically. However, in some groups, specifically the gilled lobopodians and siberiids, the gut is surrounded by pairs of serially repeated, kidney-shaped gut diverticulae (digestive glands). In some specimens, parts of the lobopodian gut can be preserved in three dimensions. This cannot result from phosphatisation, which is usually responsible for 3-D gut preservation, because the phosphate content of the guts is under 1%; the contents comprise quartz and muscovite. The gut of the representative &quot;Paucipodia&quot; is variable in width, being widest at the centre of the body. Its position in the body cavity is only loosely fixed, so flexibility is possible.

Not much is known about the neural anatomy of lobopodians due to the spare and mostly ambiguous fossil evidence. Possible traces of a nervous system were found in &quot;Paucipodia&quot;, &quot;Megadictyon&quot; and &quot;Antennacanthopodia&quot;. The first and so far the only confirmed evidence of lobopodian neural structures comes from the gilled lobopodian &quot;Kerygmachela&quot; in Park et al. 2018 — it presents a brain composed of only a protocerebrum (the frontal-most cerebral ganglion of panarthropods) that is directly connected to the nerves of eyes and frontal appendages, suggesting the protocerebral ancestry of the head of lobopodians as well as the whole Panarthropoda.

In some extant ecdysozoan such as priapulids and onychophorans, there is a layer of outermost circular muscles and a layer of innermost longitudinal muscles. The onychophorans also have a third, intermediate, layer of interwoven oblique muscles. Musculature of the gilled lobopodian &quot;Pambdelurion&quot; shows a similar anatomy, but that of the lobopodian &quot;Tritonychus&quot; shows the opposite pattern: it is the outermost muscles that are longitudinal and the innermost layer that consists of circular muscles.

== Categories ==

Based on external morphology, lobopdians may fall under different categories — for example the general worm-like taxa as &quot;xenusiid&quot; or &quot;xenusian&quot;; xenusiid with sclerite as &quot;armoured lobopodians&quot;; and taxa with both robust frontal appendages and lateral flaps as &quot;gilled lobopodians&quot;. Some of them were originally defined under a taxonomic sense (e.g. class Xenusia), but neither any of them are generally accepted as monophyletic in further studies.

=== Armoured lobopodians ===

Armoured lobopodians referred to xenusiid lobopodians which bore repeated sclerites such as spine or plates on their trunk (e.g. &quot;Hallucigenia&quot;, &quot;Microdictyon&quot;, &quot;Luolishania&quot;) or lobopods (e.g. &quot;Diania&quot;). In contrast, lobopodians without sclerites may be referred to as &quot;unarmoured lobopodians&quot;. Function of the sclerites were interpreted as protective armor and/or muscle attachment points. In some cases, only the disarticulated sclerites of the animal were preserved, which represented as component of small shelly fossils (SSF). Armoured lobopodians were suggest to be onychophoran-related and may even represent a clade in some previous studies, but their phylogenetic positions in later studies are controversial. (see text)

=== Gilled lobopodians ===

Dinocaridids with lobopodian affinities (due to shared features like annulation and lobopods) are referred to as &quot;gilled lobopodians&quot; or &quot;gilled lobopods&quot;. These forms sport a pair of flaps on each trunk segment, but otherwise no signs of arthropodization, in contrast to more derived dinocaridids like the Radiodonta that have robust and sclerotized frontal appendages. Gilled lobopodians cover at least four genera: &quot;Pambdelurion&quot;, &quot;Kerygmachela&quot;, &quot;Utahnax&quot; and &quot;Mobulavermis&quot;. &quot;Opabinia&quot; may also fall under this category in a broader sense, although the presence of lobopods in this genus is not definitively proven. &quot;Omnidens&quot;, a genus known only from &quot;Pambdelurion&quot;-like mouthparts and distal parts of the frontal appendages, may also be a gilled lobopodian. The body flaps may have functioned as both swimming appendages and gills, and are possibly homologous to the dorsal flaps of radiodonts and exites of Euarthropoda. Whether these genera were true lobopodians is still contested by some. However, they are widely accepted as stem-group arthropods just basal to radiodonts.

=== &quot;Siberion&quot; and similar taxa ===
&quot;Siberion&quot;, &quot;Megadictyon&quot; and &quot;Jianshanopodia&quot; may be grouped as siberiids (order Siberiida), jianshanopodians or &quot;giant lobopodians&quot; by some literatures. They are generally large — body length ranging between 7 and 22 centimeters (2¼ to 8⅔ inches) — xenusiid lobopodians with widen trunk, stout trunk lobopods without evidence of claws, and most notably a pair of robust frontal appendages. With the possible exception of &quot;Siberion&quot;, they also have digestive glands like those of a gilled lobopodian and basal euarthropod. Their anatomy represent transitional forms between typical xenusiids and gilled lobopodians, eventually placing them under the basalmost position of arthropod stem-group.
== Paleoecology ==
Lobopodians possibly occupied a wide range of ecological niches. Although most of them had undifferentiated appendages and straight gut, which would suggest a simple sediment-feeding lifestyle, sophisticated digestive glands and large size of gilled lobopodians and siberiids would allow them to consume larger food items, and their robust frontal appendages may even suggest a predatory lifestyle. On the other hand, luolishaniids such as &quot;Luolishania&quot; and &quot;Ovatiovermis&quot; have elaborate feather-like lobopods that presumably formed &#x27;baskets&#x27; for suspension or filter-feeding. Lobopods with curved terminal claws may have given some lobopodians the ability to climb on substrances.

Not much is known about the physiology of lobopodians. There is evidence to suggest that lobopodians moult just like other ecdysozoan taxa, but the outline and ornamentation of the harden sclerite did not vary during ontogeny. The gill-like structures on the body flaps of gilled lobopodians and ramified extensions on the lobopods of &quot;Jianshanopodia&quot; may provide respiratory function (gills). &quot;Pambdelurion&quot; may control the movement of their lobopods in a way similar to onychophorans.

==Distribution==

During the Cambrian, lobopodians displayed a substantial degree of biodiversity. One species is known from each of the Ordovician and Silurian periods, with a few more known from the Carboniferous (Mazon Creek) — this represents the paucity of exceptional lagerstatten in post-Cambrian deposits.

==Phylogeny==


The overall phylogenetic interpretation on lobopodians has changed dramatically since their discovery and first description. The reassignments are not only based on new fossil evidence, but also new embryological, neuroanatomical, and genomic (e.g. gene expression, phylogenomics) information observed from extant panarthropod taxa.

Based on their apparently onychophoran-like morphology (e.g. annulated cuticle, lobopodous appendage with claws), lobopodians were originally thought to be present a group of paleozoic onychophorans. This interpretation was challenged after the discovery of lobopodians with arthropod and tardigrade-like characteristics, suggesting that the similarity between lobopodians and onychophorans represents deeper panarthropod ancestral traits (plesiomorphies) instead of onychophoran-exclusive characteristics (synapomorphies). For example, The British palaeontologist Graham Budd sees the Lobopodia as representing a basal grade from which the phyla Onychophora and Arthropoda arose, with &quot;Aysheaia&quot; comparable to the ancestral plan, and with forms like &quot;Kerygmachela&quot; and &quot;Pambdelurion&quot; representing a transition that, via the dinocaridids, would lead to an arthropod body plan. Aysheaia&#x27;s surface ornamentation, if homologous with palaeoscolecid sclerites, may represent a deeper link connecting it with cycloneuralian outgroups. Lobopodians are paraphyletic, and include the last common ancestor of arthropods, onychophorans and tardigrades.

===Stem-group arthropods===

Compared to other panarthropod stem-groups, suggestion on the lobopodian members of arthropod stem-group is relatively consistent — siberiid like &quot;Megadictyon&quot; and &quot;Jianshanopodia&quot; occupied the basalmost position, gilled lobopodians &quot;Pambdelurion&quot; and &quot;Kerygmachela&quot; branch next, and finally lead to a clade compose of &quot;Opabinia&quot;, Radiodonta and Euarthropoda (crown-group arthropods). Their positions within arthropod stem-group are indicated by numerous arthropod groundplans and intermediate forms (e.g. arthropod-like digestive glands, radiodont-like frontal appendages and dorso-ventral appendicular structures link to arthropod biramous appendages). Lobopodian ancestry of arthropods also reinforced by genomic studies on extant taxa — gene expression support the homology between arthropod appendages and onychophoran lobopods, suggests that modern less-segmented arthropodized appendages evolved from annulated lobopodous limbs. On the other hand, primary antennae and frontal appendages of lobopodians and dinocaridids may be homologous to the labrum/hypostome complex of euarthropods, an idea support by their protocerebral origin and developmental pattern of the labrum of extant arthropods.

&quot;Diania&quot;, a genus of armoured lobopodian with stout and spiny legs, were originally thought to be associated within the arthropod stem-group based on its apparently arthropod-like (arthropodized) trunk appendages. However, this interpretation is questionable as the data provided by the original description are not consistent with the suspected phylogenic relationships. Further re-examination even revealed that the suspected arthropodization on the legs of &quot;Diania&quot; was a misinterpretation — although the spine may have hardened, the remaining cuticle of &quot;Diania&quot;&#x27;s legs were soft (not harden nor scleritzed), lacking any evidence of pivot joint and arthrodial membrane, suggest the legs are lobopods with only widely spaced annulations. Thus, the re-examination eventually reject the evidence of arthropodization (sclerotization, segmentation and articulation) on the appendages as well as the fundamental relationship between &quot;Diania&quot; and arthropods.

===Stem-group onychophorans===

While &quot;Antennacanthopodia&quot; is widely accepted as a stem-group onychophoran, the position of other xenusiid genera that were previously thought to be onychophoran-related is controversial — in further studies, most of them were either suggested to be stem-group onychophorans or basal panarthropods, with a few species (&quot;Aysheaia&quot; or &quot;Onychodictyon ferox&quot;) occasionally suggested to be stem-group tardigrades. A study in 2014 suggested that &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; are stem-group onychophorans based on their claws, which have overlapped internal structures resembling those of an extant onychophoran. This interpretation was questioned by later studies, as the structures may be a panarthropod plesiomorphy.

===Stem-group tardigrades===

Lobopodian taxa of the tardigrade stem-group is unclear. &quot;Aysheaia&quot; or &quot;Onychodictyon ferox&quot; had been suggest to be a possible member, based on the high claw number (in &quot;Aysheaia&quot;) and/or terminal lobopods with anterior-facing claws (in both taxa). Although not widely accepted, there are even suggestions that Tardigrada itself representing the basalmost panarthropod or branch between the arthropod stem-group. However, a paper in 2023 found luolishaniids to be the closest relatives of tardigrades using various morphological characteristics. 

===Stem-group panarthropods===

It is unclear that which lobopodians represent members of the panarthropod stem-group, which were branched just before the last common ancestor of extant panarthropod phyla. &quot;Aysheaia&quot; may have occupied this position based on its apparently basic morphology; while other studies rather suggest luolishaniid and hallucigenid, two lobopodian taxa which had been resolved as members of stem-group onychophorans as well.

== Described genera ==

As of 2018, over 20 lobopodian genera have been described. The fossil materials being described as lobopodians &quot;Mureropodia apae&quot; and &quot;Aysheaia prolata&quot; are considered to be disarticulated frontal appendages of the radiodonts &quot;Caryosyntrips&quot; and &quot;Stanleycaris&quot;, respectively. &quot;Miraluolishania&quot; was suggested to be synonym of &quot;Luolishania&quot; by some studies. The enigmatic &quot;Facivermis&quot; was later revealed to be a highly specialized genus of luolishaniid lobopodians.

<text>Archaeocyatha (, &#x27;ancient cups&#x27;) is a taxon of extinct, sessile, reef-building marine sponges that lived in warm tropical and subtropical waters during the Cambrian Period. It is believed that the centre of the Archaeocyatha origin is now located in East Siberia, where they are first known from the beginning of the Tommotian Age of the Cambrian, 525 million years ago (mya). In other regions of the world, they appeared much later, during the Atdabanian, and quickly diversified into over a hundred families.

They became the planet&#x27;s first reef-building animals and are an index fossil for the Lower Cambrian worldwide.

== Preservation ==
The remains of Archaeocyatha are mostly preserved as carbonate structures in a limestone matrix. This means that the fossils cannot be chemically or mechanically isolated, save for some specimens that have already eroded out of their matrices, and their morphology has to be determined from thin cuts of the stone in which they were preserved.

== Geological history ==
Today, the archaeocyathan families are recognizable by small but consistent differences in their fossilized structures: Some archaeocyathans were built like nested bowls, while others were as long as 300mm. Some archaeocyaths were solitary organisms, while others formed colonies. In the beginning of the Toyonian Age around 516 mya, the archaeocyaths went into a sharp decline. Almost all species became extinct by the Middle Cambrian, with the final-known species, &quot;Antarcticocyathus webberi&quot;, disappearing just prior to the end of the Cambrian period. Their rapid decline and disappearance coincided with a rapid diversification of the Demosponges. As for the earliest archaeocyathan, the Ediacaran sponge &quot;Arimasia&quot; from the Nama Group may be within the clade and specifically allied with Monocyathea, however this is unclear.

The archaeocyathids were important reef-builders in the early to middle Cambrian, with reefs (and indeed any accumulation of carbonates) becoming very rare after the group&#x27;s extinction until the diversification of new taxa of coral reef-builders in the Ordovician.

&quot;Antarcticocyathus &quot; was considered the only late Cambrian archaeocyath, but its reinterpretation as a lithisid sponge means that there are now no archaeocyaths post the mid-Cambrian.

==Morphology==
The typical archaeocyathid resembled a hollow horn coral. Each had a conical or vase-shaped porous skeleton of calcite similar to that of a sponge. The structure appeared like a pair of perforated, nested ice cream cones. Their skeletons consisted of either a single porous wall (Monocyathida), or more commonly as two concentric porous walls, an inner and outer wall separated by a space. Inside the inner wall was a cavity (like the inside of an ice cream cup). At the base, these pleosponges were held to the substrate by a holdfast. The body presumably occupied the space between the inner and outer shells (the intervallum).

==Ecology==

Flow tank experiments suggest that archaeocyathan morphology allowed them to exploit flow gradients, either by passively pumping water through the skeleton, or, as in present-day, extant sponges, by drawing water through the , removing nutrients, and expelling spent water and wastes through the pores into the central space.

The size of the pores places a limit on the size of plankton that archaeocyaths could have consumed; different species had different sized pores, the largest large enough to conceivably consume mesozooplankton, possibly giving rise to different ecological niches within a single reef.

Although archaeocyaths have commonly been thought of as stenobionts narrowly adapted to carbonate-dominated marine settings, they were also present in siliciclastic-dominated environments as well.

==Distribution==
The archaeocyathans inhabited coastal areas of shallow seas. Their widespread distribution over almost the entire Cambrian world, as well as the taxonomic diversity of the species, might be explained by surmising that, like true sponges, they had a planktonic larval stage that enabled their wide spread.
==Taxonomy==
Their phylogenetic affiliation has been subject to changing interpretations, yet the consensus is growing that the archaeocyath was indeed a kind of sponge, thus sometimes called a pleosponge. But some invertebrate paleontologists have placed them in an extinct, separate phylum, known appropriately as the Archaeocyatha. However, one cladistic analysis suggests that Archaeocyatha is a clade nested within the phylum Porifera (better known as the true sponges).

True archaeocyathans coexisted with other enigmatic sponge-like animals. Radiocyatha and Cribricyatha were two diverse Cambrian classes comparable to Archaeocyatha, alongside genera such as &quot;Boyarinovicyathus&quot;, &quot;Proarchaeocyathus&quot;, &quot;Acanthinocyathus&quot;, and &quot;Osadchiites&quot;.

The clade Archaeocyatha have traditionally been divided into Regulares and Irregulares (Rowland, 2001):

* Hetairacyathida (incertae sedis)
* Regulares
** Monocyathida
** Capsulocyathida
** Ajacicyathida
* Irregulares
** Thalassocyathida
** Archaeocyathida
** Kazakhstanicyathida

However, Okulitch (1955), who at the time regarded the archaeocyathans as outside of Porifera, divided the phylum in three classes:

*Phylum Archaeocyatha 
**Class Monocyathea 
**Class Archaeocyathea 
**Class Anthocyathea

<text>The Lophophorata (also called Tentaculata; not to be confused with Tentaculata Eschscholtz 1825, a class within the Ctenophora) are a Lophotrochozoan clade consisting of the Brachiozoa and the Bryozoa. They have a lophophore. Molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest that lophophorates are protostomes, but on morphological grounds they have been assessed as deuterostomes. Fossil finds of the &quot;tommotiid&quot; &quot;Wufengella&quot; suggest that they evolved from worm-like animals that resembled annelids.

<text>In music, the tonic is the first scale degree () of the diatonic scale (the first note of a scale) and the tonal center or final resolution tone that is commonly used in the final cadence in tonal (musical key-based) classical music, popular music, and traditional music. In the movable do solfège system, the tonic note is sung as &quot;do&quot;. More generally, the tonic is the note upon which all other notes of a piece are hierarchically referenced. Scales are named after their tonics: for instance, the tonic of the C major scale is the note C.

The triad formed on the tonic note, the tonic chord, is thus the most significant chord in these styles of music. In Roman numeral analysis, the tonic chord is typically symbolized by the Roman numeral &quot;I&quot; if it is major and by &quot;i&quot; if it is minor.

These chords may also appear as seventh chords: in major, as IM7, or in minor as i7 or rarely iM7:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble
 \time 4/4
 \key c \major
 &lt;c e g b&gt;1_\markup { \concat { &quot;I&quot; \raise #1 \small &quot;M7&quot; } } \bar &quot;||&quot;

 \clef treble
 \time 4/4
 \key c \minor
 &lt;c es g bes&gt;1_\markup { \concat { &quot;i&quot; \raise #1 \small &quot;7&quot; } }
 &lt;c es g b&gt;^\markup { &quot;rare&quot; }_\markup { \concat { &quot;i&quot; \raise #1 \small &quot;M7&quot; } } \bar &quot;||&quot;
&lt;/score&gt;

The tonic is distinguished from the root, which is the reference note of a chord, rather than that of the scale.

==Importance and function==
In music of the common practice period, the tonic center was the most important of all the different tone centers which a composer used in a piece of music, with most pieces beginning and ending on the tonic, usually modulating to the dominant (the fifth scale degree above the tonic, or the fourth below it) in between.

Two parallel keys have the same tonic. For example, in both C major and C minor, the tonic is C. However, relative keys (two different scales that share a key signature) have different tonics. For example, C major and A minor share a key signature that feature no sharps or flats, despite having different tonic pitches (C and A, respectively).
The term &quot;tonic&quot; may be reserved exclusively for use in tonal contexts while tonal center or pitch center may be used in post-tonal and atonal music: &quot;For purposes of non-tonal centric music, it might be a good idea to have the term &#x27;tone center&#x27; refer to the more general class of which &#x27;tonics&#x27; (or tone centers in tonal contexts) could be regarded as a subclass.&quot; Thus, a pitch center may function referentially or contextually in an atonal context, often acting as an axis or line of symmetry in an interval cycle. The term &quot;pitch centricity&quot; was coined by Arthur Berger in his &quot;Problems of Pitch Organization in Stravinsky&quot;. According to Walter Piston, &quot;the idea of a unified classical tonality replaced by nonclassical (in this case nondominant) centricity in a composition is perfectly demonstrated by Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot;&quot;.

The tonic includes four separate activities or roles as the principal goal tone, initiating event, generator of other tones, and the stable center neutralizing the tension between dominant and subdominant.

<text>The Mesozoa are minuscule, worm-like parasites of marine invertebrates. Generally, these tiny, elusive creatures consist of a somatoderm (outer layer) of ciliated cells surrounding one or more reproductive cells.

A 2017 study recovered Mesozoa as a monophyletic group that emerged in the Lophotrochozoa as sister of the Rouphozoa.

Some workers previously classified Mesozoa as the sole phylum of the lonely subkingdom Agnotozoa. Cavalier-Smith argued that at least some of the mesozoans are in fact protistans, not animals.

In the 19th century, the Mesozoa were a wastebasket taxon for multicellular organisms which lacked the invaginating gastrula which was thought to define the Metazoa.

== Evolution ==
Mesozoa were once thought to be evolutionary intermediate forms between Protozoans and Metazoans, but now they are thought to be degenerate or simplified metazoa. Their ciliated larvae are similar to the miracidium of trematodes, and their internal multiplication is similar to what happens in the sporocysts of trematodes. Mesozoan DNA has a low GC-content (40%). This amount is similar to ciliates, but ciliates tend to be binucleate. Others relate mesozoa to a group including annelids, planarians and nemerteans.

Orthonectida have a very reduced muscular and nervous system, only consisting of a few cells, but so far no muscle cells or neurons have been found in Dicyemida.

==Groupings==
The two main mesozoan groups are the Dicyemida and the Orthonectida. Other groups sometimes included in the Mesozoa are the Placozoa and the Monoblastozoa.

Monoblastozoans consist of a single description written in the 19th century of a species that has not been seen since. As such, many workers doubt that they are a real group. As described, the animal had only a single layer of tissue.

===Rhombozoan mesozoans===

Rhombozoa, or dicyemid mesozoans, are found in the nephrid tracts of squid and octopuses.
They range from a few millimeters long with twenty to thirty cells that include anterior attachment cells and a long central reproductive cell called an axial cell. This axial cell may develop asexually into vermiform juveniles or it may produce eggs and sperm that self-fertilize to produce a ciliated infusiform larva.

There are three genera: &quot;Dicyema&quot;, &quot;Pseudicyema&quot; and &quot;Dicyemennea&quot;.

Molecular evidence suggests that this phylum are derived from the Lophotrochozoa.

===Orthonectid mesozoans===

Orthonectida are found in the body spaces of various marine invertebrates including tissue spaces, gonads, genitorespiratory bursae. This pathogen causes host castration of different species.

The best known of Orthonectida is the parasite of brittle stars. The multinucleate syncytial stage lives within tissues and spaces of the gonad but can spread into arms. It causes the destruction of starfish ovary and eggs to cause castration (the male gonads are usually unaffected). The stages of the plasmodium develop into more plasmodia by simple fragmentation; at some point, they decide to go sexual. The syncytia are dioecious (either male or female), but young syncytia can fuse to produce both male and female. The males are ciliated and smaller than the females. The females and the males leave the starfish and mate in the sea. Tailed sperm enters the female and fertilizes the numerous oocytes. Each oocyst produces a small ciliated larva which makes its way to another star.

The genome of one of these species – &quot;Intoshia linei&quot; – has been sequenced. The Orthonectids may be degenerate annelid worms.

<text>Nematomorpha (sometimes called Gordiacea, and commonly known as horsehair worms, hairsnakes, or Gordian worms) are a phylum of parasitoid animals superficially similar to nematode worms in morphology, hence the name. Most species range in size from , reaching in extreme cases, and in diameter. Horsehair worms can be discovered in damp areas, such as watering troughs, swimming pools, streams, puddles, and cisterns. The adult worms are free-living, but the larvae are parasitic on arthropods, such as beetles, cockroaches, mantises, orthopterans, and crustaceans. About 351 freshwater species are known and a conservative estimate suggests that there may be about 2000 freshwater species worldwide. The name &quot;Gordian&quot; stems from the legendary Gordian knot. This relates to the fact that nematomorphs often coil themselves in tight balls that resemble knots.

==Description and biology==
Nematomorphs possess an external cuticle without cilia. Internally, they have only longitudinal muscle and a non-functional gut, with no excretory, respiratory or circulatory systems. The nervous system consists of a nerve ring near the anterior end of the animal, and a ventral nerve cord running along the body.

Reproductively, they have two distinct sexes, with the internal fertilization of eggs that are then laid in gelatinous strings. Adults have cylindrical gonads, opening into the cloaca. The larvae have rings of cuticular hooks and terminal stylets that are believed to be used to enter the hosts. Once inside the host, the larvae live inside the haemocoel and absorb nutrients directly through their skin. Development into the adult form takes weeks or months, and the larva moults several times as it grows in size.

The adults are mostly free-living in freshwater or marine environments, and males and females aggregate into tight balls (&quot;Gordian knots&quot;) during mating.
In &quot;Spinochordodes tellinii&quot; and &quot;Paragordius tricuspidatus&quot;, which have grasshoppers and crickets as their hosts, the infection acts on the infected host&#x27;s brain. This causes the host insect to seek water and drown itself, thus returning the nematomorph to water. &quot;P. tricuspidatus&quot; is also remarkably able to survive the predation of their host, being able to wiggle out of the predator that has eaten the host. The nematomorpha parasite affects host &quot;Hierodula patellifera&quot;″s light-interpreting organs so the host is attracted to horizontally polarized light. Thus the host goes into water and the parasite&#x27;s lifecycle completes. Many of the genes the parasites use for manipulating their host have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer from the host genome.

There are a few cases of accidental parasitism in vertebrate hosts, including dogs, cats, and humans. Several cases involving &quot;Parachordodes&quot;, &quot;Paragordius&quot;, or &quot;Gordius&quot; have been recorded in human hosts in Japan and China.

== Community ecology ==
Owing to their use of orthopterans as hosts, nematomorphs can be significant factors in shaping community ecology. One study conducted in a Japanese riparian ecosystem showed that nematomorphs can cause orthopterans to become 20 times more likely to enter water than non-infected orthopterans; these orthopterans constituted up to 60% of the annual energy intake for the Kirikuchi char. Absence of nematomorphs from riparian communities can thus lead to char predating more heavily on other aquatic invertebrates, potentially causing more widespread physiological effects.

==Taxonomy==

Nematomorphs can be confused with nematodes, particularly mermithid worms. Unlike nematomorphs, mermithids do not have a terminal cloaca. Male mermithids have one or two spicules just before the end apart from having a thinner, smoother cuticle, without areoles and a paler brown colour.

The phylum is placed along with the Ecdysozoa clade of moulting organisms that include the Arthropoda. Their closest relatives are the nematodes. The two phyla make up the group Nematoida in the clade Cycloneuralia. During the larval stage, the animals show a resemblance to adult kinorhyncha and some species of Loricifera and Priapulida, all members of the group Scalidophora. The earliest Nematomorph could be &quot;Maotianshania&quot;, from the Lower Cambrian; this organism is, however, very different from extant species; fossilized worms resembling the modern forms have been reported from mid Cretaceous Burmese amber dated to 100 million years ago.

Relationships within the phylum are still somewhat unclear, but two classes are recognised. The five marine species of nematomorph are contained in Nectonematoida. This order is monotypic containing the genus &quot;Nectonema&quot; : adults are planktonic and the larvae parasitise decapod crustaceans, especially crabs. They are characterized by a double row of natotory setae along each side of the body, dorsal and ventral longitudinal epidermal cords, a spacious and fluid-filled blastocoelom and singular gonads.

The approximately 320 remaining species are distributed between two families, within the monotypic class Gordioida. Gordioidean adults are free-living in freshwater or semiterrestrial habitats and larvae parasitise insects, primarily orthopterans. Unlike nectonematiodeans, gordioideans lack lateral rows of setae, have a single, ventral epidermal cord and their blastocoels are filled with mesenchyme in young animals but become spacious in older individuals.

<text>Onychophora (from , , &quot;claws&quot;; and , , &quot;to carry&quot;), commonly known as velvet worms (for their velvety texture and somewhat wormlike appearance) or more ambiguously as peripatus (after the first described genus, &quot;Peripatus&quot;), is a phylum of elongate, soft-bodied, many-legged animals. In appearance they have variously been compared to worms with legs, caterpillars, and slugs. They prey upon other invertebrates, which they catch by ejecting an adhesive slime. Approximately 200 species of velvet worms have been described, although the true number is likely to be much greater.

The two extant families of velvet worms are Peripatidae and Peripatopsidae. They show a peculiar distribution, with the peripatids being predominantly equatorial and tropical, while the peripatopsids are all found south of the equator. It is the only phylum within Animalia that is wholly endemic to terrestrial environments, at least among extant members. Velvet worms are generally considered close relatives of the Arthropoda and Tardigrada, with which they form the proposed taxon Panarthropoda. This makes them of palaeontological interest, as they can help reconstruct the ancestral arthropod. Only two fossil species are confidently assigned as onychophorans: &quot;Antennipatus&quot; from the Late Carboniferous, and &quot;Cretoperipatus&quot; from the Late Cretaceous, the latter belonging to Peripatidae. In modern zoology, they are known for their mating behaviours and the bearing of live young in some species.

==Anatomy and physiology==
Velvet worms are segmented animals with a flattened cylindrical body cross-section and rows of unstructured body appendages known as oncopods or lobopods (informally: stub feet). They reach lengths between depending on species, with the smallest known being &quot;Ooperipatellus nanus&quot; and the largest known is &quot;Mongeperipatus solorzanoi&quot;. The number of leg pairs ranges from as few as 13 (in &quot;Ooperipatellus nanus&quot;) to as many as 43 (in &quot;Plicatoperipatus jamaicensis&quot;). Their skin consists of numerous, fine transverse rings and is often inconspicuously coloured orange, red or brown, but sometimes also bright green, blue, gold or white, and occasionally patterned with other colours. Segmentation is outwardly inconspicuous, and identifiable by the regular spacing of the pairs of legs and in the regular arrangement of skin pores, excretion organs and concentrations of nerve cells. The individual body sections are largely unspecialised; even the head develops only a little differently from the abdominal segments. Segmentation is apparently specified by the same gene as in other groups of animals, and is activated in each case, during embryonic development, at the rear border of each segment and in the growth zone of the stub feet. Although onychophorans fall within the protostome group, their early development has a deuterostome trajectory, (with the mouth and anus forming separately); this trajectory is concealed by the rather sophisticated processes which occur in early development.

===Appendages===

The stub feet that characterise the velvet worms are conical, baggy appendages of the body, which are internally hollow and have no joints. Although the number of feet can vary considerably between species, their structure is basically very similar. Rigidity is provided by the hydrostatic pressure of their fluid contents, and movement is usually obtained passively by stretching and contraction of the animal&#x27;s entire body. However, each leg can also be shortened and bent by internal muscles. Due to the lack of joints, this bending can take place at any point along the sides of the leg. In some species, two different organs are found within the feet:

*Crural glands are situated at the shoulder of the legs, extending into the body cavity. They open outwards at the crural papillae—small wart-like bumps on the belly side of the leg—and secrete chemical messenger materials called pheromones. Their name comes from the Latin &quot;cruralis&quot; meaning &quot;of the legs&quot;.
*Coxal vesicles are pouches located on the belly side of the leg, which can be everted and probably serve in water absorption. They belong to the family Peripatidae and are named from , the Latin word for &quot;hip&quot;.
On each foot is a pair of retractable, hardened (sclerotised) chitin claws, which give the taxon its scientific name: Onychophora is derived from the , , &quot;claws&quot;; and , , &quot;to carry&quot;. At the base of the claws are three to six spiny &quot;cushions&quot; on which the leg sits in its resting position and on which the animal walks over smooth substrates. The claws are used mainly to gain a firm foothold on uneven terrain. Each claw is composed of three stacked elements, like Russian nesting dolls. The outermost is shed during ecdysis, which exposes the next element, which is fully formed and so does not need time to harden before it is used.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1038/nature13576&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This distinctive construction identifies many early Cambrian fossils as early offshoots of the onychophoran lineage. Apart from the pairs of legs, there are three further body appendages, which are at the head and comprise three segments:

* On the first head segment is a pair of slender antennae, which serve in sensory perception. They probably do not correspond directly to the antennae of the Arthropoda, but perhaps rather with their &quot;lips&quot; or labrum. At their base is a pair of simple eyes, except in a few blind species. In front of these, in many Australian species, are various dimples, the function of which is not yet clear. It appears that in at least some species, these serve in the transfer of sperm-cell packages (spermatophores).
* On the belly side of the second head segment is the labrum, a mouth opening surrounded by sensitive &quot;lips&quot;. In the velvet worms, this structure is a muscular outgrowth of the throat, so, despite its name, it is probably not homologous to the labrum of the Arthropoda and is used for feeding. Deep within the oral cavity lie the sharp, crescent-shaped &quot;jaws&quot;, or mandibles, which are strongly hardened and resemble the claws of the feet, with which they are serially homologous; early in development, the jaw appendages have a position and shape similar to the subsequent legs. The jaws are divided into internal and external mandibles and their concave surface bears fine denticles. They move backward and forward in a longitudinal direction, tearing apart the prey, apparently moved in one direction by musculature and the other by hydrostatic pressure. The claws are made of sclerotised α-chitin, reinforced with phenols and quinones, and have a uniform composition, except that there is a higher concentration of calcium towards the tip, presumably affording greater strength.

The surface of the mandibles is smooth, with no ornamentation. The cuticle in the mandibles (and claws) is distinct from the rest of the body. It has an inner and outer component; the outer component has just two layers (whereas body cuticle has four), and these outer layers (in particular the inner epicuticle) are dehydrated and strongly tanned, affording toughness.

===Slime glands===

On the third head segment, to the left and right of the mouth, are two openings called &quot;oral papillae&quot;, with each containing a large, heavily branched slime gland. These slime glands lie roughly in the center of a velvet worm&#x27;s body and secrete a sort of milky-white slime. The slime is used to both ensnare prey and act as a distraction for defensive purposes. In certain species, an organ connected to the slime gland known as the &quot;slime conductor&quot; is broadened into a reservoir, allowing it to hold pre-produced slime.

Velvet worm slime glands and oral papilla are likely modified and repurposed limbs. The glands themselves are probably modified crural glands. All three structures correspond to an evolutionary origin in the leg pairs of the other segments.

===Skin and muscle===
Unlike the arthropods, velvet worms do not possess a rigid exoskeleton. Instead, their fluid-filled body cavity acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, similarly to many distantly related soft-bodied animals that are cylindrically shaped, for example sea anemones and various worms. Pressure of their incompressible internal bodily fluid on the body wall provides rigidity, and muscles are able to act against it. The body wall consists of a non-cellular outer skin, the cuticula; a single layer of epidermis cells forming an internal skin; and beneath this, usually three layers of muscle, which are embedded in connective tissues. The cuticula is about a micrometer thick and covered with fine . In composition and structure, it resembles the cuticula of the arthropods, consisting of α-chitin and various proteins, although not containing collagen. It can be divided into an external epicuticula and an internal procuticula, which themselves consist of exo- and endo-cuticula. This multi-level structure is responsible for the high flexibility of the outer skin, which enables the velvet worm to squeeze itself into the narrowest crevices. Although outwardly water-repellent, the cuticula is not able to prevent water loss by respiration, and, as a result, velvet worms can live only in microclimates with high humidity to avoid desiccation. The surface of the cuticula is scattered with numerous fine papillae, the larger of which carry visible villi-like sensitive bristles. The papillae themselves are covered with tiny scales, lending the skin a velvety appearance (from which the common name is likely derived). It also feels like dry velvet to the touch, for which its water-repellent nature is responsible. Moulting of the skin (ecdysis) takes place regularly, around every 14 days, induced by the hormone ecdysone. The inner surface of the skin bears a hexagonal pattern. At each moult, the shed skin is replaced by the epidermis, which lies immediately beneath it; unlike the cuticula, this consists of living cells. Beneath this lies a thick layer of connective tissue, which is composed primarily of collagen fibres aligned either parallel or perpendicular to the body&#x27;s longitudinal axis. The colouration of Onychophora is generated by a range of pigments. The solubility of these pigments is a useful diagnostic character: in all arthropods and tardigrades, the body pigment is soluble in ethanol. This is also true for the Peripatidae, but in the case of the Peripatopsidae, the body pigment is insoluble in ethanol.

Within the connective tissue lie three continuous layers of unspecialised smooth muscular tissue. The relatively thick outer layer is composed of annular muscles, and the similarly voluminous inner layer of longitudinal muscles. Between them lie thin diagonal muscles that wind backward and forward along the body axis in a spiral. Between the annular and diagonal muscles exist fine blood vessels, which lie below the superficially recognisable transverse rings of the skin and are responsible for the pseudo-segmented markings. Beneath the internal muscle layer lies the body cavity. In cross-section, this is divided into three regions by so-called dorso-ventral muscles, which run from the middle of the underbelly through to the edges of the upper side: a central midsection and on the left and right, two side regions that also include the legs.

===Circulation===
The body cavity is known as a &quot;pseudocoel&quot;, or haemocoel. Unlike a true coelom, a pseudocoel is not fully enclosed by a cell layer derived from the embryonic mesoderm. A coelom is, however, formed around the gonads and the waste-eliminating nephridia. As the name &quot;haemocoel&quot; suggests, the body cavity is filled with a blood-like liquid in which all the organs are embedded; in this way, they can be easily supplied with nutrients circulating in the blood. This liquid is colourless as it does not contain pigments; for this reason, it serves only a limited role in oxygen transport.
Two different types of blood cells (or haemocytes) circulate in the fluid: Amoebocytes and nephrocytes. The amoebocytes probably function in protection from bacteria and other foreign bodies; in some species, they also play a role in reproduction. Nephrocytes absorb toxins or convert them into a form suitable for elimination by the nephridia.

The haemocoel is divided by a horizontal partition, the diaphragm, into two parts: The pericardial sinus along the back and the perivisceral sinus along the belly. The former encloses the tube-like heart, and the latter, the other organs. The diaphragm is perforated in many places, enabling the exchange of fluids between the two cavities. The heart itself is a tube of annular muscles consisting of epithelial tissues, with two lateral openings () per segment. While it is not known whether the rear end is open or closed, from the front, it opens directly into the body cavity.

Since there are no blood vessels, apart from the fine vessels running between the muscle layers of the body wall and a pair of arteries that supply the antennae, this is referred to as an open circulation. The timing of the pumping procedure can be divided into two parts: Diastole and systole. During diastole, blood flows through the ostia from the pericardial sinus (the cavity containing the heart) into the heart. When the systole begins, the ostia close and the heart muscles contract inwards, reducing the volume of the heart. This pumps the blood from the front end of the heart into the perivisceral sinus containing the organs. In this way, the various organs are supplied with nutrients before the blood finally returns to the pericardial sinus via the perforations in the diaphragm. In addition to the pumping action of the heart, body movements also influence circulation.

===Respiration===
Oxygen uptake occurs to an extent via simple diffusion through the entire body surface, with the coxal vesicles on the legs possibly being involved in some species. However, of most importance is gas exchange via fine unbranched tubes, the tracheae, which draw oxygen from the surface deep into the various organs, particularly the heart.

The walls of these structures, which are less than three micrometers thick in their entirety, consist only of an extremely thin membrane through which oxygen can easily diffuse. The tracheae originate at tiny openings, the spiracles, which themselves are clustered together in dent-like recesses of the outer skin, the . The number of &quot;tracheae bundles&quot; thus formed is on average around 75 bundles per body segment; they accumulate most densely on the back of the organism.

Unlike the arthropods, the velvet worms are unable to control the openings of their tracheae; the tracheae are always open, entailing considerable water loss in arid conditions. Water is lost twice as fast as in earthworms and forty times faster than in caterpillars. For this reason, velvet worms are dependent upon habitats with high air humidity.

Oxygen transport is helped by the oxygen carrier hemocyanin.

===Digestion===

The digestive tract begins slightly behind the head, the mouth lying on the underside a little way from the frontmost point of the body. Here, prey can be mechanically dismembered by the mandibles with their covering of fine toothlets. Two salivary glands discharge via a common conductor into the subsequent &quot;throat&quot;, which makes up the first part of the front intestine. The saliva that they produce contains mucus and hydrolytic enzymes, which initiate digestion in and outside the mouth.

The throat itself is very muscular, serving to absorb the partially liquified food and to pump it, via the oesophagus, which forms the rear part of the front intestine, into the central intestine. Unlike the front intestine, this is not lined with a cuticula but instead consists only of a single layer of epithelial tissue, which does not exhibit conspicuous indentation as is found in other animals.

On entering the central intestine, food particles are coated with a mucus-based peritrophic membrane, which serves to protect the lining of the intestine from damage by sharp-edged particles. The intestinal epithelium secretes further digestive enzymes and absorbs the released nutrients, although the majority of digestion has already taken place externally or in the mouth. Indigestible remnants arrive in the rear intestine, or rectum, which is once again lined with a cuticula and which opens at the anus, located on the underside near to the rear end.

In almost every segment is a pair of excretory organs called nephridia, which are derived from coelom tissue. Each consists of a small pouch that is connected, via a flagellated conductor called a nephridioduct, to an opening at the base of the nearest leg known as a nephridiopore. The pouch is occupied by special cells called podocytes, which facilitate ultrafiltration of the blood through the partition between haemocoelom and nephridium.

The composition of the urinary solution is modified in the nephridioduct by selective recovery of nutrients and water and by isolation of poison and waste materials, before it is excreted to the outside world via the nephridiopore. The most important nitrogenous excretion product is the water-insoluble uric acid; this can be excreted in solid state, with very little water. This so-called uricotelic excretory mode represents an adjustment to life on land and the associated necessity of dealing economically with water.

A pair of former nephridia in the head were converted secondarily into the salivary glands, while another pair in the final segment of male specimens now serve as glands that apparently play a role in reproduction.

===Sensation===
The entire body, including the stub feet, is littered with numerous papillae: warty protrusions responsive to touch that carry a mechanoreceptive bristle at the tip, each of which is also connected to further sensory nerve cells lying beneath. The mouth papillae, the exits of the slime glands, probably also have some function in sensory perception. Sensory cells known as &quot;sensills&quot; on the &quot;lips&quot; or labrum respond to chemical stimuli and are known as chemoreceptors. These are also found on the two antennae, which seem to be the velvet worm&#x27;s most important sensory organs.

Except in a few (typically subterranean) species, one simply constructed eye (ocellus) lies behind each antenna, laterally, just underneath the head. This consists of a chitinous ball lens, a cornea and a retina and is connected to the centre of the brain via an optic nerve. The retina comprises numerous pigment cells and photoreceptors; the latter are easily modified flagellated cells, whose flagellum membranes carry a photosensitive pigment on their surface.

The rhabdomeric eyes of the Onychophora are thought to be homologous with the median ocelli of arthropods; this would suggest that the last common ancestor of arthropods may have only had median ocelli.
However, the innervation shows that the homology is limited: The eyes of Onychophora form behind the antenna, whereas the opposite is true in arthropods.

===Reproduction===
Both sexes possess pairs of gonads, opening via a channel called a gonoduct into a common genital opening, the gonopore, which is located on the rear ventral side. Both the gonads and the gonoduct are derived from true coelom tissue.
In females, the two ovaries are joined in the middle and to the horizontal diaphragm. The gonoduct appears differently depending on whether the species is live-bearing or egg-laying. In live-bearing species, each exit channel divides into a slender oviduct and a roomy &quot;womb&quot;, the uterus, in which the embryos develop. The single vagina, to which both uteri are connected, runs outward to the gonopore. In egg-laying species, whose gonoduct is uniformly constructed, the genital opening lies at the tip of a long egg-laying apparatus, the ovipositor. The females of many species also possess a sperm repository called the &quot;receptacle seminis&quot;, in which sperm cells from males can be stored temporarily or for longer periods.

Males possess two separate testes, along with the corresponding sperm vesicle (the vesicula seminalis) and exit channel (the vasa efferentia). The two vasa efferentia unite to a common sperm duct, the vas deferens, which in turn widens through the ejaculatory channel to open at the gonopore. Directly beside or behind this lie two pairs of special glands, which probably serve some auxiliary reproductive function; the rearmost glands are also known as anal glands. A penis-like structure has so far been found only in males of the genus &quot;Paraperipatus&quot; but has not yet been observed in action.

There are different mating procedures: in some species males deposit their spermatophore directly into the female&#x27;s genital opening, while others deposit it on the female&#x27;s body, where the cuticle will collapse, allowing the sperm cells to migrate into the female. There are also Australian species where the male place their spermatophore on top of their head, which is then pressed against the female&#x27;s genitals. In these species the head have elaborate structures like spikes, spines, hollow stylets, pits, and depressions, whose purpose is to either hold the sperm and / or assist in the sperm transfer to the female. The males of most species also secrete a pheromone from glands on the underside of the legs to attract females.

==Distribution and habitat==
===Distribution===

Velvet worms are found in the tropics and in the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere. Members of the family Peripatidae are found the tropical regions of South America, Central America, the Caribbean islands, Gabon, Northeast India, and Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, members of Peripatopsidae are found Chile, Australia, Southern Africa, New Guinea, and New Zealand. When looking at velvet worms as a whole, the majority of are found in Australia and South America.

Fossils have been found in Baltic amber, indicating that they were formerly more widespread in the Northern Hemisphere when conditions were more suitable.

===Habitat===
Velvet worms always sparsely occupy the habitats where they are found: they are rare among the fauna of which they are a part.

All extant velvet worms are terrestrial (land-living) and prefer dark environments with high air humidity. They are found particularly in the rainforests of the tropics and temperate zones, where they live among moss cushions and leaf litter, under tree trunks and stones, in rotting wood or in termite tunnels. They also occur in unforested grassland, if there exist sufficient crevices in the soil into which they can withdraw during the day, and in caves. Two species live in caves, a habitat to which their ability to squeeze themselves into the smallest cracks makes them exceptionally well-adapted and in which constant living conditions are guaranteed. Since the essential requirements for cave life were probably already present prior to the settlement of these habitats, this may be described as exaptation.

Some species of velvet worms are able to occupy human-modified land-uses, such as cocoa and banana plantations in South America and the Caribbean, but for others, conversion of rainforests is likely one of the most important threats to their survival (see Conservation).

Velvet worms are photophobic: They are repelled by bright light sources. Because the danger of desiccation is greatest during the day and in dry weather, it is not surprising that velvet worms are usually most active at night and during rainy weather. Under cold or dry conditions, they actively seek out crevices in which they shift their body into a resting state.

==Slime==

The Onychophora forcefully squirt glue-like slime
from their oral papillae; they do so either in defense against predators or to capture prey. The openings of the glands that produce the slime are in the papillae, a pair of highly modified limbs on the sides of the head below the antennae. Inside, they have a syringe-like system that, by a geometric amplifier, allows for fast squirt using slow muscular contraction. High speed films show the animal expelling two streams of adhesive liquid through a small opening (50–200 microns) at a speed of . The interplay between the elasticity of oral papillae and the fast unsteady flow produces a passive oscillatory motion (30–60 Hz) of the oral papillae. The oscillation causes the streams to cross in mid air, weaving a disordered net; the velvet worms can control only the general direction where the net is thrown.

The slime glands themselves are deep inside the body cavity, each at the end of a tube more than half the length of the body. The tube both conducts the fluid and stores it until it is required. The distance that the animal can propel the slime varies; usually it squirts it about a centimetre, but the maximal range has variously been reported to be ten centimetres, or even nearly a foot, although accuracy drops with range. It is not clear to what extent the range varies with the species and other factors. One squirt usually suffices to snare a prey item, although larger prey may be further immobilised by smaller squirts targeted at the limbs; additionally, the fangs of spiders are sometimes targeted. Upon ejection, it forms a net of threads about twenty microns in diameter, with evenly spaced droplets of viscous adhesive fluid along their length. It subsequently dries, shrinking, losing its stickiness, and becoming brittle. Onychophora eat their dried slime when they can, which seems provident, since an onychophoran requires about 24 days to replenish an exhausted slime repository.

The slime can account for up to 11% of the organism&#x27;s dry weight and is 90% water; its dry residue consists mainly of proteins—primarily a collagen-type protein. 1.3% of the slime&#x27;s dry weight consists of sugars, mainly galactosamine. The slime also contains lipids and the surfactant nonylphenol. Onychophora are the only organisms known to produce this latter substance. It tastes &quot;slightly bitter and at the same time somewhat astringent&quot;. The proteinaceous composition accounts for the slime&#x27;s high tensile strength and stretchiness. The lipid and nonylphenol constituents may serve one of two purposes: They may line the ejection channel, stopping the slime from sticking to the organism when it is secreted; or they may slow the drying process long enough for the slime to reach its target.

==Behaviour==

===Locomotion===

Velvet worms/Onychophora move in a slow and gradual motion that makes them difficult for prey to notice. Their trunk is raised relatively high above the ground, and they walk with non-overlapping steps.
To move from place to place, the velvet worm crawls forward using its legs; unlike in arthropods, both legs of a pair are moved simultaneously. The claws of the feet are used only on hard, rough terrain where a firm grip is needed; on soft substrates, such as moss, the velvet worm walks on the foot cushions at the base of the claws.

Actual locomotion is achieved less by the exertion of the leg muscles than by local changes of body length. This can be controlled using the annular and longitudinal muscles. If the annular muscles are contracted, the body cross-section is reduced, and the corresponding segment lengthens; this is the usual mode of operation of the hydrostatic skeleton as also employed by other worms. Due to the stretching, the legs of the segment concerned are lifted and swung forward. Local contraction of the longitudinal muscles then shortens the appropriate segment, and the legs, which are now in contact with the ground, are moved to the rear. This part of the locomotive cycle is the actual leg stroke that is responsible for forward movement. The individual stretches and contractions of the segments are coordinated by the nervous system such that contraction waves run the length of the body, each pair of legs swinging forward and then down and rearward in succession. &quot;Macroperipatus&quot; can reach speeds of up to four centimetres per second, although speeds of around 6 body-lengths per minute are more typical.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1111/j.1096-3642.1950.tb01699.x&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The body gets longer and narrower as the animal picks up speed; the length of each leg also varies during each stride.

===Sociality===
The brains of Onychophora, though small, are very complex; consequently, the organisms are capable of rather sophisticated social interactions. Behaviour may vary from genus to genus, so this article reflects the most-studied genus, &quot;Euperipatoides&quot;.

The &quot;Euperipatoides&quot; form social groups of up to fifteen individuals, usually closely related, which will typically live and hunt together. Groups usually live together; in drier regions an example of a shared home would be the moist interior of a rotting log. Group members are extremely aggressive towards individuals from other logs. Dominance is achieved through aggression and maintained through submissive behaviour. After a kill, the dominant female always feeds first, followed in turn by the other females, then males, then the young.

When assessing other individuals, individuals often measure one another up by running their antennae down the length of the other individual. Once hierarchy has been established, pairs of individuals will often cluster together to form an &quot;aggregate&quot;; this is fastest in male-female pairings, followed by pairs of females, then pairs of males.

Social hierarchy is established by a number of interactions: Higher-ranking individuals will chase and bite their subordinates while the latter are trying to crawl on top of them. Juveniles never engage in aggressive behaviour, but climb on top of adults, which tolerate their presence on their backs.
Hierarchy is quickly established among individuals from a single group, but not among organisms from different groups; these are substantially more aggressive and very rarely climb one another or form aggregates. Individuals within an individual log are usually closely related; especially so with males. This may be related to the intense aggression between unrelated females.

===Feeding===

Velvet worms are ambush predators, hunting only by night, and are able to capture animals at least their own size, although capturing a large prey item may take almost all of their mucus-secreting capacity. They feed on almost any small invertebrates, including woodlice (Isopoda), termites (Isoptera), crickets (Gryllidae), book/bark lice (Psocoptera), cockroaches (Blattidae), millipedes and centipedes (Myriapoda), spiders (Araneae), various worms, and even large snails (Gastropoda). Depending on their size, they eat on average every one to four weeks. They are considered to be ecologically equivalent to centipedes (Chilopoda).

The most energetically favourable prey are two-fifths the size of the hunting onychophoran. Ninety percent of the time involved in eating prey is spent ingesting it; re-ingestion of the slime used to trap the insect is performed while the onychophoran locates a suitable place to puncture the prey, and this phase accounts for around 8% of the feeding time, with the remaining time evenly split between examining, squirting, and injecting the prey. In some cases, chunks of the prey item are bitten off and swallowed; undigestable components take around 18 hours to pass through the digestive tract.

Onychophora probably do not primarily use vision to detect their prey; although their tiny eyes do have a good image-forming capacity, their forward vision is obscured by their antennae; their nocturnal habit also limits the utility of eyesight. Air currents, formed by prey motion, are thought to be the primary mode of locating prey; the role of scent, if any, is unclear. Because it takes so long to ingest a prey item, hunting mainly happens around dusk; the onychophorans will abandon their prey at sunrise. This predatory way of life is probably a consequence of the velvet worm&#x27;s need to remain moist. Due to the continual risk of desiccation, often only a few hours per day are available for finding food. This leads to a strong selection for a low cost-benefit ratio, which cannot be achieved with a herbivorous diet.

Velvet worms literally creep up on their prey, with their smooth, gradual and fluid movement escaping detection. Once they reach their prey, they touch it very softly with their antennae to assess its size and nutritional value. After each poke, the antenna is hastily retracted to avoid alerting the prey. This investigation may last anywhere upwards of ten seconds, until the velvet worm makes a decision as to whether to attack it, or until it disturbs the prey and the prey flees. Hungry Onychophora spend less time investigating their prey and are quicker to apply their slime. Once slime has been squirted, Onychophora are determined to pursue and devour their prey, in order to recoup the energy investment. They have been observed to spend up to ten minutes searching for removed prey, after which they return to their slime to eat it. In the case of smaller prey, they may opt not to use slime at all. Subsequently, a soft part of the prey item (usually a joint membrane in arthropod prey) is identified, punctured with a bite from the jaws, and injected with saliva. This kills the prey very quickly and begins a slower process of digestion. While the onychophoran waits for the prey to digest, it salivates on its slime and begins to eat it (and anything attached to it). It subsequently tugs and slices at the earlier perforation to allow access to the now-liquefied interior of its prey. The jaws operate by moving backwards and forwards along the axis of the body (not in a side-to-side clipping motion as in arthropods), conceivably using a pairing of musculature and hydrostatic pressure. The pharynx is specially adapted for sucking, to extract the liquefied tissue; the arrangement of the jaws about the tongue and lip papillae ensures a tight seal and the establishment of suction. In social groups, the dominant female is the first to feed, not permitting competitors access to the prey item for the first hour of feeding. Subsequently, subordinate individuals begin to feed. The number of males reaches a peak after females start to leave the prey item. After feeding, individuals clean their antennae and mouth parts before re-joining the rest of their group.

===Reproduction and life-cycle===
Almost all velvet worms reproduce sexually. The sole exception is &quot;Epiperipatus imthurni&quot;, which have no males and reproduce by parthenogenesis. In most cases, velvet worms are sexually dimorphic. Females are usually larger than males and can often have more legs. All velvet worms have internal fertilization, though the way this is done varies widely. For most of them, a package of sperm cells called the spermatophore is placed into female&#x27;s vagina. In many species, fertilization happens only once. Because of this, copulation can happen before reproductive organs are even fully developed. In cases like this, sperm cells are kept in a special reservoir where they can survive for longer.

The detailed process by which this is achieved is in most cases still unknown, a true penis having been observed only in species of the genus &quot;Paraperipatus&quot;. In many Australian species, there exist dimples or special dagger- or axe-shaped structures on the head; the male of &quot;Florelliceps stutchburyae&quot; presses a long spine against the female&#x27;s genital opening and probably positions its spermatophore there in this way. During the process, the female supports the male by keeping him clasped with the claws of her last pair of legs. The mating behavior of two species of the genus &quot;Peripatopsis&quot; is particularly curious. Here, the male places two-millimetre spermatophores on the back or sides of the female. Amoebocytes from the female&#x27;s blood collect on the inside of the site, and both the spermatophore&#x27;s casing and the body wall on which it rests are decomposed via the secretion of enzymes. This releases the sperm cells, which then move freely through the haemocoel, penetrate the external wall of the ovaries and finally fertilize the ova. Why this self-inflicted skin injury does not lead to bacterial infections is not yet understood (though likely related to the enzymes used to deteriorate the skin or facilitate the transfer of viable genetic material from male to female). Velvet worms are found in egg-laying (oviparous), egg-live-bearing (ovoviviparous) and live-bearing (viviparous) forms.

In a recent peer-reviewed paper published in the &quot;Journal of Zoology,&quot; researchers discovered that certain species of Peripatus exhibit a unique form of parental care. Unlike most invertebrates, where parental involvement is minimal, female Peripatus were observed actively guarding their eggs and even providing protection to their offspring after hatching. This finding challenges the conventional understanding of reproductive behavior in invertebrates and highlights the diversity of parenting strategies in the animal kingdom.

*Ovipary occurs solely in the Peripatopsidae, often in regions with erratic food supply or unsettled climate. In these cases, the yolk-rich eggs measure 1.3 to 2.0 mm and are coated in a protective chitinous shell. Maternal care is unknown.
*The majority of species are ovoviviparous: the medium-sized eggs, encased only by a double membrane, remain in the uterus. The embryos do not receive food directly from the mother, but are supplied instead by the moderate quantity of yolk contained in the eggs—they are therefore described as lecithotrophic. The young emerge from the eggs only a short time before birth. This probably represents the velvet worm&#x27;s original mode of reproduction, i.e., both oviparous and viviparous species developed from ovoviviparous species.
*True live-bearing species are found in both families, particularly in tropical regions with a stable climate and regular food supply throughout the year. The embryos develop from eggs only micrometres in size and are nourished in the uterus by their mother, hence the description &quot;matrotrophic&quot;. The supply of food takes place either via a secretion from the mother directly into the uterus or via a genuine tissue connection between the epithelium of the uterus and the developing embryo, known as a placenta. The former is found only outside the American continents, while the latter occurs primarily in America and the Caribbean and more rarely in the Old World. The gestation period can amount to up to 15 months, at the end of which the offspring emerge in an advanced stage of development. The embryos found in the uterus of a single female do not necessarily have to be of the same age; it is quite possible for there to be offspring at different stages of development and descended from different males. In some species, young tend to be released only at certain points in the year.

A female can have between 1 and 23 offspring per year; development from fertilized ovum to adult takes between 6 and 17 months and does not have a larval stage. This is probably also the original mode of development. Velvet worms have been known to live for up to six years.

==Ecology==
The velvet worm&#x27;s important predators are primarily various spiders and centipedes, along with rodents and birds, such as, in Central America, the clay-coloured thrush (&quot;Turdus grayi&quot;). In South America, Hemprichi&#x27;s coral snake (&quot;Micrurus hemprichii&quot;) feeds almost exclusively on velvet worms. For defence, some species roll themselves reflexively into a spiral, while they can also fight off smaller opponents by ejecting slime. Various mites (Acari) are known to be ectoparasites infesting the skin of the velvet worm. Skin injuries are usually accompanied by bacterial infections, which are almost always fatal.

The South African species &quot;Peripatopsis capensis&quot; has been inadvertently introduced to Santa Cruz Island in the Galapagos Islands, where it co-occurs with native velvet worms.

==Conservation==
The global conservation status of velvet worm species is difficult to estimate; many species are only known to exist at their type locality (the location at which they were first observed and described). The collection of reliable data is also hindered by low population densities, their typically nocturnal behaviour and possibly also as-yet undocumented seasonal influences and sexual dimorphism. To date, the only onychophorans evaluated by the IUCN are: 
*&quot;Mesoperipatus tholloni&quot; (Data Deficient)
*&quot;Plicatoperipatus jamaicensis&quot; (Near Threatened)
*&quot;Peripatoides indigo&quot; (Vulnerable)
*&quot;Peripatoides suteri&quot; (Vulnerable)
*&quot;Peripatopsis alba&quot; (Vulnerable)
*&quot;Peripatopsis clavigera&quot; (Vulnerable)
*&quot;Macroperipatus insularis&quot; (Endangered)
*&quot;Leucopatus anophthalmus&quot; (Endangered)
*&quot;Opisthopatus roseus&quot; (Critically Endangered)
*&quot;Peripatopsis leonina&quot; (Critically Endangered)
*&quot;Speleoperipatus spelaeus&quot; (Critically Endangered)

The primary threat comes from destruction and fragmentation of velvet worm habitat due to industrialisation, draining of wetlands, and slash-and-burn agriculture. Many species also have naturally low population densities and closely restricted geographic ranges; as a result, relatively small localised disturbances of important ecosystems can lead to the extinction of entire populations or species. Collection of specimens for universities or research institutes also plays a role on a local scale. There is a very pronounced difference in the protection afforded to velvet worms between regions: in some countries, such as South Africa, there are restrictions on both collecting and exporting, while in others, such as Australia, only export restrictions exist. Many countries offer no specific safeguards at all. Tasmania has a protection programme that is unique worldwide: one region of forest has its own velvet worm conservation plan, which is tailored to a particular velvet worm species.

==Phylogeny and evolution==

=== Internal phylogeny ===

Living velvet worms are divided into two families: Peripatidae and Peripatopsidae. These diverged around 274 million years ago during the Late Devonian and have since diversified. Within Peripatidae, the genera Eoperipatus (found in Southeast Asia) and Mesoperipatus (found in Gabon) were the most basal, while the rest of the group is found in tropical regions of the Americas. On the other hand, Peritpatopsidae can be divided into two main clades. One has members in Southern Africa and Chile, while the others live in Australasia.

Below is a mostly genus-level cladogram of the various types of velvet worm. Note that this phylogeny doesn&#x27;t analyze every species. As of 2023, there are around 232 total living species, meaning this phylogeny should eventually be updated.

=== External phylogeny ===

In their present forms, the velvet worms are probably very closely related to the arthropods, a very extensive taxon that incorporates, for instance, the crustaceans, insects, and arachnids. They share, among other things, an exoskeleton consisting of α-chitin and non-collagenous proteins; gonads and waste-elimination organs enclosed in true coelom tissue; an open blood system with a tubular heart situated at the rear; an abdominal cavity divided into pericardial and perivisceral cavities; respiration via tracheae; and similar embryonic development. Segmentation, with two body appendages per segment, is also a shared feature.

However, the antennae, mandibles, and oral papillae of velvet worms are probably &quot;not&quot; homologous to the corresponding features in arthropods; i.e., they probably developed independently.

Another closely related group are the comparatively obscure water bears (Tardigrada); however, due to their very small size, water bears have no need for—and hence lack—blood circulation and separate respiratory structures: shared characteristics that support common ancestry of velvet worms and arthropods.

Together, the velvet worms, arthropods, and water bears form a monophyletic taxon, the Panarthropoda, i.e., the three groups collectively cover all descendants of their last common ancestor. Due to certain similarities of form, the velvet worms were usually grouped with the water bears to form the taxon Protoarthropoda. This designation would imply that both velvet worms and water bears are not yet as highly developed as the arthropods. Modern systematic theories reject such conceptions of &quot;primitive&quot; and &quot;highly developed&quot; organisms and instead consider exclusively the historical relationships among the taxa. These relationships are not as yet fully understood, but it is considered probable that the velvet worms&#x27; sister groups form a taxon designated Tactopoda, thus:

For a long time, velvet worms were also considered related to the annelids. They share, among other things, a worm-like body; a thin and flexible outer skin; a layered musculature; paired waste-elimination organs; as well as a simply constructed brain and simple eyes. Decisive, however, was the existence of segmentation in both groups, with the segments showing only minor specialisation. The parapodia appendages found in annelids therefore correspond to the stump feet of the velvet worms. Within the Articulata hypothesis developed by Georges Cuvier, the velvet worms therefore formed an evolutionary link between the annelids and the arthropods: worm-like precursors first developed parapodia, which then developed further into stub feet as an intermediate link in the ultimate development of the arthropods&#x27; appendages. Due to their structural conservatism, the velvet worms were thus considered &quot;living fossils&quot;. This perspective was expressed paradigmatically in the statement by the French zoologist A. Vandel:

:&quot;Onychophorans can be considered highly evolved annelids, adapted to terrestrial life, which announced prophetically the Arthropoda. They are a lateral branch which has endured from ancient times until today, without important modifications.&quot;

Modern taxonomy does not study criteria such as &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; states of development or distinctions between &quot;main&quot; and &quot;side&quot; branches—only family relationships indicated by cladistic methods are considered relevant. From this point of view, several common characteristics still support the Articulata hypothesis — segmented body; paired appendages on each segment; pairwise arrangement of waste-elimination organs in each segment; and above all, a rope-ladder-like nervous system based on a double nerve strand lying along the belly. An alternative concept, most widely accepted today, is the so-called Ecdysozoa hypothesis. This places the annelids and Panarthropoda in two very different groups: the former in the Lophotrochozoa and the latter in the Ecdysozoa. Mitochondrial gene sequences also provide support for this hypothesis. Proponents of this hypothesis assume that the aforementioned similarities between annelids and velvet worms either developed convergently or were primitive characteristics passed unchanged from a common ancestor to both the Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa. For example, in the first case, the rope-ladder nervous system would have developed in the two groups independently, while in the second case, it is a very old characteristic, which does not imply a particularly close relationship between the annelids and Panarthropoda. The Ecdysozoa concept divides the taxon into two, the Panarthropoda into which the velvet worms are placed, and the sister group Cycloneuralia, containing the threadworms (Nematoda), horsehair worms (Nematomorpha) and three rather obscure groups: the mud dragons (Kinorhyncha); penis worms (Priapulida); and brush-heads (Loricifera).
Particularly characteristic of the Cycloneuralia is a ring of &quot;circumoral&quot; nerves around the mouth opening, which the proponents of the Ecdysozoa hypothesis also recognise in modified form in the details of the nerve patterns of the Panarthropoda. Both groups also share a common skin-shedding mechanism (ecdysis) and molecular biological similarities. One problem of the Ecdysozoa hypothesis is the velvet worms&#x27; subterminal position of their mouths: Unlike in the Cycloneuralia, the mouth is not at the front end of the body, but lies further back, under the belly. However, investigations into their developmental biology, particularly regarding the development of the head nerves, suggest that this was not always the case, and that the mouth was originally terminal (situated at the tip of the body). This is supported by the fossil record.

The &quot;stem-group arthropod&quot; hypothesis is very widely accepted, but some trees suggest that the onychophorans may occupy a different position; their brain anatomy is more closely related to that of the chelicerates than to any other arthropod. The modern velvet worms form a monophyletic group, incorporating all the descendants of their common ancestor. Important common derivative characteristics (synapomorphies) include, for example, the mandibles of the second body segment and the oral papillae and associated slime glands of the third; nerve strands extending along the underside with numerous cross-linkages per segment; and the special form of the tracheae. By 2011, some 180 modern species, comprising 49 genera, had been described; the actual number of species is probably about twice this. According to more recent study, 82 species of Peripatidae and 115 species of Peripatopsidae have been described thus far. However, among the 197 species, 20 are &quot;nomina dubia&quot;, due to major taxonomic inconsistencies. The best-known is the type genus &quot;Peripatus&quot;, which was described as early as 1825 and which, in English-speaking countries, stands representative for all velvet worms. All genera are assigned to one of two families, the distribution ranges of which do not overlap but are separated by arid areas or oceans:
* The Peripatopsidae exhibit relatively many characteristics that are perceived as original or &quot;primitive&quot;. The number of leg pairs in this family range from 13 (in &quot;Ooperipatellus nanus&quot;) to 29 (in &quot;Paraperipatus papuensis&quot;). Behind or between the last leg pair is the genital opening (gonopore). Both oviparous and ovoviviparous, as well as genuinely viviparous, species exist, although the peripatopsids essentially lack a placenta. Their distribution is circumaustral, encompassing Australasia, South Africa, and Chile.
* The Peripatidae exhibit a range of derivative features. They are longer, on average, than the Peripatopsidae and also have more legs. The number of leg pairs in this family range from 19 (in &quot;Typhloperipatus williamsoni&quot;) to 43 (in &quot;Plicatoperipatus jamaicensis&quot;). The gonopore is always between the leg pair. None of the peripatid species are oviparous, and the overwhelming majority are viviparous. The females of many viviparous species develop a placenta with which to provide the growing embryo with nutrients. Distribution of the peripatids is restricted to the tropical and subtropical zones; in particular, they inhabit Central America, northern South America, Gabon, Northeast India, and Southeast Asia.

=== Genomics ===
As of February 2025, velvet worms have had only two nuclear genomes sequenced. These are of &quot;Euperipatoides rowelli&quot; (a peripatopsid) and &quot;Epiperipatus broadwayi&quot; (a peripatid). The first one is highly fragmented, while the second is less so, but still needs improvement. Velvet worms seem to display genome gigantism, with the more complete assembly (E. broadwayi) having an size of 5.60 giga-base pairs. Around 70.92% of its genome are repeat sequences, something that contributes to the bulk of its size. While less substantial, it also has very large introns, or parts of a gene that do not become proteins.

=== Evolution ===

==== Insights on decay and fossilization ====

Due to being soft-bodied, onychophorans need excellent conditions to fossilize. However, even when this happens, their fossils can be subject to taphonomic bias. Experiments were done with modern velvet worms to analyze their decomposition in various saline solutions. The study also investigated whether they experienced something called stemward slippage. In this phenomenon, animals are falsely categorized as more primitive due to the decay of certain features.

The researchers found that different features decayed at significantly different rates. Salinity and time of moult had little effect on decay, and the way things decomposed remained the same for different species (though it could happen at different speeds). Before any degradation, velvet worms flex into a S, U, or circular shape. Most flexing happens in the first 24 hours, but the process can continue for around two more days. In the early stages of decay, the epidermis and outer cuticle separate, causing a bloated appearance. The elongates while increasing in width by around 10–30%. The limbs do the same, increasing in length and width by around 10–25%. Around the same time, the internal organs begin to degrade. This eventually culminates in the gut rupturing, destroying the other organs. In later stages of decay, the body cuticle shrinks close to its original size. A similar trend was found with the limbs, but it was just short of being statistically significant. It&#x27;s around this time that many external features begin to deteriorate. These include the dermal papillae, leg rings, anus, gonopore, antenna, slime papillae, and eventually eyes. Interestingly, the dermal papillae on the trunk disappear faster than those on the limbs. Even as decay progresses, the body is still recognizable. This stops once the outer cuticle finally ruptures. After that, the animal’s anatomy is extremely difficult to interpret. At this stage, the only identifiable features would be the chitinous jaws and claws.

Onychophorans are unlikely to experience any stemward slippage since their defining features (jaws, feet, and slime papillae) are generally decay-resistant. However, decomposition has a significant impact on fossil anatomy. For starters, the preserved body outline is probably somewhat inaccurate, as this gets bloated in the decay process. A similar thing happens with the limbs, so this needs to be accounted for when analyzing locomotion and/or leg length. While fossilized onychophorans can appear to display patterning, these aren&#x27;t true to life. pigment granules are one of the first things to degrade and can easily move around in the body. Another finding is that characters such as internal organs or the body cavity are highly unlikely to fossilize. If these appear preserved in a fossil, they should be treated with skepticism, especially if they’re unmineralized. When it comes to placement of the mouth, even moderate decay makes it hard to tell if it&#x27;s at the front or underside of the head. Additionally, fossils that lack decay-resistant features probably lacked them in life. This is even more plausible if the fossil preserves decay-prone features, as their presence indicates a better level of preservation. For example, an onychophoran (or related animal) with eyes but no claws likely never had them.

==== Emergence from Lobopods ====

Certain fossils from the early Cambrian bear a striking resemblance to the velvet worms. These fossils, known collectively as the lobopodians, were marine and represent a grade from which arthropods, tardigrades, and Onychophora arose.
Possible fossils of onychophorans are found in the Cambrian, Ordovician (possibly), Silurian and Pennsylvanian periods.

Historically, all fossil Onychophora and lobopodians were lumped into the taxon Xenusia, further subdivided by some authors to the Paleozoic Udeonychophora and the Mesozoic/Tertiary Ontonychophora; living Onychophora were termed Euonychophora. Importantly, few of the Cambrian fossils bear features that distinctively unite them with the Onychophora; none can be confidently assigned to the onychophoran crown or even stem group. Possible exceptions are &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; and related taxa such as &quot;Collinsium ciliosum&quot;, which bear distinctly onychophoran-like claws. It is not clear when the transition to a terrestrial existence was made, but it is considered plausible that it took place between the Ordovician and late Silurian – approximately – via the intertidal zone.

==== Velvet worms and their diversification ====
The low preservation potential of the non-mineralised onychophorans means that they have a sparse fossil record. The lobopodian &quot;Helenodora&quot; from the Carboniferous of North America has been suggested to be a member of Onychophora, but other studies recover it as more closely related to other lobopodians. A Late Carboniferous fossil from Montceau-les-Mines, France, &quot;Antennipatus&quot; has been suggested to have clear onychophoran affinities, likely the first terrestrial onychophoran, but its poor preservation prohibits differentiating between its placement on the stem or crown of the two extant families, or on the onychophoran stem-group.

In 2018, the identification of &quot;Antennipatus&quot; as the oldest onychophoran has been argued by Giribet and colleagues, who suggested that the minimum age of &quot;Antennipatus&quot; would be during the Gzhelian age around , and incorporated the taxon conservatively for the phylogenetic analysis of oncyhophorans based on the uncertainty of its placement within the order. In 2021, Baker and colleagues conducted divergence analyses using molecular dating and treating &quot;Antennipatus&quot; conservatively as a stem-group onychophoran with a minimum age of , resulting in a divergence date of for the crown group onychophorans. Crown group representatives are known only from amber, the oldest being &quot;Cretoperipatus&quot; from Burmese amber during the Cenomanian-Turonian stages of the Late Cretaceous, around 100-90 million years old, assigned to the family Peripatidae. The affinity of amber records from the Cenozoic, like &quot;Tertiapatus,&quot; and &quot;Succinipatopsis&quot;, which form the suggested superfamily termed Tertiapatoidea, has been considered doubtful by other authors.

<text>Nemertea is a phylum of animals also known as ribbon worms or proboscis worms, consisting of about 1300 known species. Most ribbon worms are very slim, usually only a few millimeters wide, although a few have relatively short but wide bodies. Many have patterns of yellow, orange, red and green coloration.

The foregut, stomach and intestine run a little below the midline of the body, the anus is at the tip of the tail, and the mouth is under the front. A little above the gut is the , a cavity which mostly runs above the midline and ends a little short of the rear of the body. All species have a proboscis which lies in the rhynchocoel when inactive but to emerge just above the mouth to capture the animal&#x27;s prey with venom. A highly extensible muscle in the back of the rhynchocoel pulls the proboscis in when an attack ends. A few species with stubby bodies filter feed and have suckers at the front and back ends, with which they attach to a host.

The brain is a ring of four ganglia, positioned around the rhynchocoel near the animal&#x27;s front end. At least a pair of ventral nerve cords connect to the brain and run along the length of the body. Most nemerteans have various chemoreceptors, and on their heads some species have a number of pigment-cup ocelli, which can detect light but can not form an image. Nemerteans respire through the skin. They have at least two lateral vessels which are joined at the ends to form a loop, and these and the rhynchocoel are filled with fluid. There is no heart, and the flow of fluid depends on contraction of muscles in the vessels and the body wall. To filter out soluble waste products, flame cells are embedded in the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels, and remove the wastes through a network of pipes to the outside.

All nemerteans move slowly, using their external cilia to glide on surfaces on a trail of slime, while larger species use muscular waves to crawl, and some swim by dorso-ventral undulations. A few live in the open ocean while the rest find or make hiding places on the bottom. About a dozen species inhabit freshwater, mainly in the tropics and subtropics, and another dozen species live on land in cool, damp places. Most nemerteans are carnivores, feeding on annelids, clams and crustaceans. Some species of nemerteans are scavengers, and a few live commensally inside the mantle cavity of molluscs. 

In most species the sexes are separate, but all the freshwater species are hermaphroditic. Nemerteans often have numerous temporary gonads (ovaries or testes), and build temporary gonoducts (ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted) opening to a gonopore, one per gonad, when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, and others protect their eggs in various ways. The fertilized egg divides by spiral cleavage and grows by determinate development, in which the fate of a cell can usually be predicted from its predecessors in the process of division. The embryos of most taxa develop either directly to form juveniles (like the adult but smaller) or larvae that resemble the planulas of cnidarians. However, some form a pilidium larva, in which the developing juvenile has a gut which lies across the larva&#x27;s body, and usually eats the remains of the larva when it emerges. The bodies of some species fragment readily, and even parts cut off near the tail can grow full bodies.

Traditional taxonomy divides the phylum in two classes, Anopla (&quot;unarmed&quot; – their proboscises do not have a little dagger) with two orders, and Enopla (&quot;armed&quot; with a dagger) also with two orders. However, it is now accepted that Anopla are paraphyletic, as one order of Anopla is more closely related to Enopla than to the other order of Anopla. The phylum Nemertea itself is monophyletic, its main synapomorphies being the rhynchocoel and eversible proboscis. Traditional taxonomy says that nemerteans are closely related to flatworms, but both phyla are regarded as members of the Lophotrochozoa, a very large clade, sometimes viewed as a superphylum that also includes molluscs, annelids, brachiopods, bryozoa and many other protostomes.

==History==

In 1555 Olaus Magnus wrote of a marine worm which was apparently long (&quot;40 cubits&quot;), about the width of a child&#x27;s arm, and whose touch made a hand swell. William Borlase wrote in 1758 of a &quot;sea long worm&quot;, and in 1770 Gunnerus wrote a formal description of this animal, which he called &quot;Ascaris longissima&quot;. Its current name, &quot;Lineus longissimus&quot;, was first used in 1806 by Sowerby. In 1995, a total of 1,149 species had been described and grouped into 250 genera.

Nemertea are named after the Greek sea-nymph Nemertes, one of the daughters of Nereus and Doris. Alternative names for the phylum have included &quot;Nemertini&quot;, &quot;Nemertinea&quot;, and &quot;Rhynchocoela&quot;. The Nemertodermatida are a separate phylum, whose closest relatives appear to be the Acoela.

== Description ==

=== Body structure and major cavities ===

The typical nemertean body is very thin in proportion to its length. The smallest are a few millimeters long, most are less than , and several exceed . The longest animal ever found, at long, may be a specimen of &quot;Lineus longissimus&quot;, Ruppert, Fox and Barnes refer to a &quot;Lineus longissimus&quot; long, washed ashore after a storm off St Andrews in Scotland. Other estimates are about . Zoologists find it extremely difficult to measure this species. For comparison:
* The longest recorded blue whale was .
* The dinosaurs &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot; and &quot;Patagotitan&quot; are estimated at approximately and respectively.
* A specimen of the Arctic giant jellyfish &quot;Cyanea capillata arctica&quot; was long.

&quot;L. longissimus&quot;, however, is usually only a few millimeters wide. The bodies of most nemerteans can stretch a lot, up to 10 times their resting length in some species, but reduce their length to 50% and increase their width to 300% when disturbed. A few have relatively short but wide bodies, for example &quot;Malacobdella grossa&quot; is up to long and wide, and some of these are much less stretchy. Smaller nemerteans are approximately cylindrical, but larger species are flattened dorso-ventrally. Many have visible patterns in various combinations of yellow, orange, red and green.

The outermost layer of the body has no cuticle, but consists of a ciliated and glandular epithelium containing rhabdites, which form the mucus in which the cilia glide. Each ciliated cell has many cilia and microvilli. The outermost layer rests on a thickened basement membrane, the dermis. Next to the dermis are at least three layers of muscles, some circular and some longitudinal. The combinations of muscle types vary between the different classes, but these are not associated with differences in movement. Nemerteans also have dorso-ventral muscles, which flatten the animals, especially in the larger species. Inside the concentric tubes of these layers is mesenchyme, a kind of connective tissue. In pelagic species this tissue is gelatinous and buoyant.

They are unsegmented, but at least one species, Annulonemertes minusculus, is segmented. But this is assumed to be a derived trait. The segmentation does not include the coelom and body wall, and is therefore referred to as pseudosegmentation.

The mouth is ventral and a little behind the front of the body. The foregut, stomach and intestine run a little below the midline of the body and the anus is at the tip of the tail. Above the gut and separated from the gut by mesenchyme is the rhynchocoel, a cavity which mostly runs above the midline and ends a little short of the rear of the body. The rhynchocoel of class Anopla has an orifice a little to the front of the mouth, but still under the front of the body. In the other class, Enopla, the mouth and the front of the rhynchocoel share an orifice. The rhynchocoel is a coelom, as it is lined by epithelium.

=== Proboscis and feeding ===

The proboscis is an infolding of the body wall, and sits in the rhynchocoel when inactive. When muscles in the wall of the rhynchocoel compress the fluid inside, the pressure makes the proboscis jump inside-out along a canal called the rhynchodeum and through an orifice, the proboscis pore. The proboscis has a muscle which attaches to the back of the rhynchocoel, can stretch up to 30 times its inactive length and acts to retract the proboscis.

The proboscis of the class Anopla exits from an orifice which is separate from the mouth, coils around the prey and immobilizes it by sticky, toxic secretions. The Anopla can attack as soon as the prey moves into the range of the proboscis. Some Anopla have branched proboscises which can be described as &quot;a mass of sticky spaghetti&quot;. The animal then draws its prey into its mouth.
In most of the class Enopla, the proboscis exits from a common orifice of the rhynchocoel and mouth. A typical member of this class has a stylet, a calcareous barb, with which the animal stabs the prey many times to inject toxins and digestive secretions. The prey is then swallowed whole or, after partial digestion, its tissues are sucked into the mouth. The stylet is attached about one-third of the distance from the end of the ed proboscis, which extends only enough to expose the stylet. On either side of the active stylet are sacs containing back-up stylets to replace the active one as the animal grows or an active one is lost. Instead of one stylet, the Polystilifera have a pad that bears many tiny stylets, and these animals have separate orifices for the proboscis and mouth, unlike other Enopla. The Enopla can only attack after contacting the prey.

Some nemerteans, such as &quot;L. longissimus&quot;, absorb organic food in solution through their skins, which may make the long, slim bodies an advantage. Suspension feeding is found only among the specialized symbiotic bdellonemerteans, which have a proboscis but no stylet, and use suckers to attach themselves to bivalves.

=== Respiration and circulatory system ===
Nemerteans lack specialized gills, and respiration occurs over the surface of the body, which is long and sometimes flattened. Like other animals with thick body walls, they use fluid circulation rather than diffusion to move substances through their bodies. The circulatory system consists of the rhynchocoel and peripheral vessels, while their blood is contained in the main body cavity. The fluid in the rhynchocoel moves substances to and from the proboscis, and functions as a fluid skeleton in everting the proboscis and in burrowing. The vessels circulate fluid round the whole body and the rhynchocoel provides its own local circulation. The circulatory vessels are a system of coeloms.

In the simplest type of circulatory system, two lateral vessels are joined at the ends to form a loop. However, many species have additional long-wise and cross-wise vessels. There is no heart nor pumping vessels, and the flow of fluid depends on contraction of both the vessels and the body wall&#x27;s muscles. In some species, circulation is intermittent, and fluid ebbs and flows in the long-wise vessels. The fluid in the vessels is usually colorless, but in some species it contains cells that are yellow, orange, green or red. The red type contain hemoglobin and carry oxygen, but the function of the other pigments is unknown.

=== Excretion ===

Nemertea use organs called protonephridia to excrete soluble waste products, especially nitrogenous by-products of cellular metabolism. In nemertean protonephridia, flame cells which filter out the wastes are embedded in the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels. The flame cells remove the wastes into two collecting ducts, one on either side, and each duct has one or more nephridiopores through which the wastes exit. Semiterrestrial and freshwater nemerteans have many more flame cells than marines, sometimes thousands. The reason may be that osmoregulation is more difficult in non-marine environments.

=== Nervous-system and senses ===

The central nervous-system consists of a brain and paired ventral nerve cords that connect to the brain and run along the length of the body. The brain is a ring of four ganglia, masses of nerve cells, positioned round the rhynchocoel near its front end – while the brains of most protostome invertebrates encircle the foregut. Most nemertean species have just one pair of nerve cords, many species have additional paired cords, and some species also have a dorsal cord. In some species the cords lie within the skin, but in most they are deeper, inside the muscle layers. The central nervous-system is often red or pink because it contains hemoglobin. This stores oxygen for peak activity or when the animal experiences anoxia, for example while burrowing in oxygen-free sediments.

Some species have paired cerebral organs, sacs whose only openings are to the outside. Others species have unpaired evertible organs on the front of their heads. Some have slits along the side of the head or grooves obliquely across the head, and these may be associated with paired cerebral organs. All of these are thought to be chemoreceptors, and the cerebral organs may also aiding osmoregulation. Small pits in the epidermis appear to be sensors. On their head, some species have a number of pigment-cup ocelli, which can detect light but not form an image. Most nemerteans have two to six ocelli, although some have hundreds. A few tiny species that live between grains of sand have statocysts, which sense balance.

&quot;Paranemertes peregrina&quot;, which feeds on polychaetes, can follow the prey&#x27;s trails of mucus, and find its burrow by backtracking along its own trail of mucus.

=== Movement ===
Nemerteans generally move slowly, though they have occasionally been documented to successfully prey on spiders or insects. Most nemerteans use their external cilia to glide on surfaces on a trail of slime, some of which is produced by glands in the head. Larger species use muscular waves to crawl, and some aquatic species swim by dorso-ventral undulations. Some species burrow by means of muscular peristalsis, and have powerful muscles. Some species of the suborder Monostilifera, whose proboscis have one active stylet, move by extending the proboscis, sticking it to an object and pulling the animal toward the object.

=== Reproduction and life-cycle ===
Larger species often break up when stimulated, and the fragments often grow into full individuals. Some species fragment routinely and even parts near the tail can grow full bodies. But this kind of extreme regeneration is restricted to only a few types of nemerteans, and is assumed to be a derived feature. All reproduce sexually, and most species are gonochoric (the sexes are separate), but all the freshwater forms are hermaphroditic.

Nemerteans often have numerous temporary gonads (ovaries or testes), forming a row down each side of the body in the mesenchyme. Temporary gonoducts (ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted), one per gonad, are built when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, some lay them in a burrow or tube, and some protect them by cocoons or gelatinous strings. Some bathypelagic (deep sea) species have internal fertilization, and some of these are viviparous, growing their embryos in the female&#x27;s body.

The zygote (fertilised egg) divides by spiral cleavage and grows by determinate development, in which the fate of a cell can usually be predicted from its predecessors in the process of division. The embryos of most taxa develop either directly to form juveniles (like the adult but smaller) or to form planuliform larvae. The planuliform larva stage may be short-lived and lecithotrophic (&quot;yolky&quot;) before becoming a juvenile, or may be planktotrophic, swimming for some time and eating prey larger than microscopic particles. However, many members of the order Heteronemertea and the palaeonemertean family Hubrechtiidae form a pilidium larva, which can capture unicellular algae and which Maslakova describes as like a deerstalker cap with the ear flaps pulled down. It has a gut which lies across the body, a mouth between the &quot;ear flaps&quot;, but no anus. A small number of imaginal discs form, encircling the archenteron (developing gut) and coalesce to form the juvenile. When it is fully formed, the juvenile bursts out of the larva body and usually eats it during this catastrophic metamorphosis. This larval stage is unique in that there are no Hox genes involved during development, which are only found in the juveniles developing inside the larvae.

The species &quot;Paranemertes peregrina&quot; has been reported as having a life span of around 18 months.

== Ecological significance ==
Most nemerteans are marine animals that burrow in sediments, lurk in crevices between shells, stones or the holdfasts of algae or sessile animals. Some live deep in the open oceans, and have gelatinous bodies. Others build semi-permanent burrows lined with mucus or produce cellophane-like tubes. Mainly in the tropics and subtropics, about 12 species appear in freshwater, and about a dozen species live on land in cool, damp places, for example under rotting logs.

The terrestrial &quot;Argonemertes dendyi&quot; is a native of Australia but has been found in the British Isles, in Sao Miguel in the Azores, in Gran Canaria, and in a lava tube at Kaumana on the Island of Hawaii. It can build a cocoon, which allows it to avoid desiccation while being transported, and it may be able to build populations quickly in new areas as it is a protandrous hermaphrodite. Another terrestrial genus, &quot;Geonemertes&quot;, is mostly found in Australasia but has species in the Seychelles, widely across the Indo-Pacific, in Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic, in Frankfurt, in the Canary Islands, in Madeira and in the Azores. &quot;Geonemertes pelaensis&quot; has been implicated in the decline of native arthropod species on the Ogasawara Islands, where it was introduced in the 1980s.

Most are carnivores, feeding on annelids, clams and crustaceans, and may kill annelids of about their own size. They sometimes take fish, both living and dead. Insects and myriapods are the only known prey of the two terrestrial species of &quot;Argonemertes&quot;.
A few nemerteans are scavengers, and these generally have good distance chemoreception (&quot;smell&quot;) and are not selective about their prey. A few species live commensally inside the mantle cavity of molluscs and feed on micro-organisms filtered out by the host.

Near San Francisco the nemertean &quot;Carcinonemertes errans&quot; has consumed about 55% of the total egg production of its host, the dungeness crab &quot;Metacarcinus magister&quot;. &quot;C. errans&quot; is considered a significant factor in the collapse of the dungeness crab fishery. Other coastal nemerteans have devastated clam beds.

The few predators on nemerteans include bottom-feeding fish, some sea birds, a few invertebrates including horseshoe crabs, and other nemerteans. Nemerteans&#x27; skins secrete toxins that deter many predators, but some crabs may clean nemerteans with one claw before eating them. The American &quot;Cerebratulus lacteus&quot; and the South African &quot;Polybrachiorhynchus dayi&quot;, both called &quot;tapeworms&quot; in their respective localities, are sold as fish bait.

==Taxonomy==

Traditional taxonomic classification has divided the group into two classes and four orders:
* Class Anopla (&quot;unarmed&quot;). Includes animals with proboscis without stylet, and a mouth underneath and behind the brain.
** Order Palaeonemertea. Comprises 100 marine species. Their body wall has outer circular and inner length-wise muscles. In addition, &quot;Carinoma tremaphoros&quot; has circular and inner length-wise muscles in the epidermis; the extra muscle layers seem to be needed for burrowing by peristalsis.
** Order Heteronemertea. Comprises about 400 species. The majority are marine, but three are freshwater. Their body-wall muscles are disposed in four layers, alternately circular and length-wise starting from the outermost layer. The order includes the strongest swimmers. Two genera have branched proboscises.
* Class Enopla (&quot;armed&quot;). All have stylets except order Bdellonemertea. Their mouth is located underneath and ahead of the brain. Their main nerve cords run inside body-wall muscles.
** Order Bdellonemertea. Includes seven species, of which six live as commensals in the mantle of large clams and one in that of a freshwater snail. The hosts filter feed and all the hosts steal food from them. These nemerteans have short, wide bodies and have no stylets but have a sucking pharynx and a posterior stucker, with which they move like inchworms.
** Order Hoplonemertea. Comprises 650 species. They live in benthic and pelagic sea water, in freshwater and on land. They feed by commensalism and parasitism, and are armed with stylet(s)
*** Suborder Monostilifera. Includes 500 species with a single central stylet. Some use the stylet for locomotion as well as for capturing prey.
*** Suborder Polystilifera. Includes about 100 pelagic and 50 benthic species. Their pads bear many tiny stylets.

Recent molecular phylogenetic studies divided the group into two superclasses, three classes, and eight orders:
*Superclass Pronemertea
**Class Palaeonemertea
***Order Carinomiformes
***Order Tubulaniformes
***Order Archinemertea
*Superclass Neonemertea
**Class Pilidiophora
***Order Hubrechtiiformes
***Order Heteronemertea
**Class Hoplonemertea (= Enopla)
***Order Polystilifera
***Order Monostilifera (includes Bdellonemertea)
*&quot;incertae sedis&quot;
** Order Arhynchonemertea (provisionally has been separated its own class Arhynchocoela in 1995)

== Evolutionary history ==

=== Fossil record ===

As nemerteans are mostly soft-bodied, one would expect fossils of them to be extremely rare. One might expect the stylet of a nemertean to be preserved, since it is made of calcium phosphate, but no fossil stylets have yet been found. reported nemertean fossils and traces from the Middle Triassic of Germany.

The Middle Cambrian fossil &quot;Amiskwia&quot; from the Burgess Shale has been classed as a nemertean, based on a resemblance to some unusual deep-sea swimming nemerteans, but few paleontologists accept this classification as the Burgess Shale fossils show no evidence of rhynchocoel nor intestinal caeca.

 reported fossils of vermiform organisms with a wide range of morphologies occurring on bedding planes from the Late Ordovician (Katian) Vauréal Formation (Canada). In the specimens preserving the anterior end of the body, this end is pointed or rounded, bearing a rhynchocoel with the proboscis, which is characteristic for nemerteans. The authors attributed these fossils to nemerteans and interpreted them as the oldest record of the group reported so far. However, Knaust &amp; Desrochers cautioned that partly preserved putative nemertean fossils might ultimately turn out to be fossils of turbellarians or annelids.

It has been suggested that &quot;Archisymplectes&quot;, one of the Pennsylvanian-age animals from Mazon Creek in northern and central Illinois, may be a nemertean.
This fossil, however, only preserves the outline of the &quot;worm&quot;, and there is no evidence of a proboscis,
so there is no certainty that it represents a nemertean.

==== Within Nemertea ====

There is no doubt that the phylum Nemertea is monophyletic (meaning that the phylum includes all and only descendants of one ancestor that was also a member of the phylum). The synapomorphies (trait shared by an ancestor and all its descendants, but not by other groups) include the eversible proboscis located in the rhynchocoel.

While treat the Palaeonemertea as monophyletic, regard them as paraphyletic and basal (contains the ancestors of the more recent clades). The Anopla (&quot;unarmed&quot;) represent an evolutionary grade of nemerteans without stylets (comprising the Heteronemertea and the Palaeonemerteans), while Enopla (&quot;armed&quot;) are monophyletic, but find that Palaeonemertea is doubly paraphyletic, having given rise to both the Heteronemertea and the Enopla. treat the Bdellonemertea as a clade separate from the Hoplonemertea, while believe the Bdellonemertea are a part of the Monostilifera (with one active stylet), which are within the Hoplonemertea – which implies that &quot;Enopla&quot; and &quot;Hoplonemertea&quot; are synonyms for the same branch of the tree. The Polystilifera (with many tiny stylets) are monophyletic.

==== Relationships with other phyla ====
English-language writings have conventionally treated nemerteans as acoelomate bilaterians that are most closely related to flatworms (Platyhelminthes). These pre-cladistics analyses emphasised as shared features: multiciliated (with multiple cilia per cell), glandular epidermis; rod-shaped secretory bodies or rhabdites; frontal glands or organs; protonephridia; and acoelomate body organization. However, multiciliated epidermal cells and epidermal gland cells are also found in Ctenophora, Annelida, Mollusca and other taxa. The rhabdites of nemertea have a different structure from those of flatworms at the microscopic scale. The frontal glands or organs of flatworms vary a lot in structure, and similar structures appear in small marine annelids and entoproct larvae. The protonephridia of nemertea and flatworms are different in structure, and in position – the flame cells of nemertea are usually in the walls of the fluid vessels and are served by &quot;drains&quot; from which the wastes exit by a small number of tubes through the skin, while the flame cells of flatworms are scattered throughout the body.
Rigorous comparisons show no synapomorphies of nemertean and platyhelminth nephridia.

According to more recent analyses, in the development of nemertean embryos, ectomesoderm (outer part of the mesoderm, which is the layer in which most of the internal organs are built) is derived from cells labelled 3a and 3b, and endomesoderm (inner part of the mesoderm) is derived from the 4d cell. Some of the ectomesoderm in annelids, echiurans and molluscs is derived from cells 3a and 3b, while the ectomesoderm of polyclad flatworms is derived from the 2b cell and acoel flatworms produce no ectomesoderm. In nemerteans the space between the epidermis and the gut is mainly filled by well-developed muscles embedded in noncellular connective tissue. This structure is similar to that found in larger flatworms such as polyclads and triclads, but a similar structure of body-wall muscles embedded in noncellular connective tissue is widespread among the Spiralia (animals in which the early cell divisions make a spiral pattern) such as sipunculans, echiurans and many annelids.
Nemerteans&#x27; affinities with Annelida (including Echiura, Pogonophora, Vestimentifera and perhaps Sipuncula) and Mollusca make the ribbon-worms members of Lophotrochozoa, which include about half of the extant animal phyla. Lophotrochozoa groups: those animals that feed using a lophophore (Brachiopoda, Bryozoa, Phoronida, Entoprocta); phyla in which most members&#x27; embryos develop into trochophore larvae (for example Annelida and Mollusca); and some other phyla (such as Platyhelminthes, Sipuncula, Gastrotricha, Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, Nemertea, Phoronida, Platyhelminthes, and Rotifera).
These groupings are based on molecular phylogeny, which compares sections of organisms DNA and RNA. While analyses by molecular phylogeny are confident that members of Lophotrochozoa are more closely related to each other than of non-members, the relationships between members are mostly unclear.

Most protostome phyla outside the Lophotrochozoa are members of Ecdysozoa (&quot;animals that molt&quot;), which include Arthropoda, Nematoda and Priapulida. Most other bilaterian phyla are in the Deuterostomia, which include Echinodermata and Chordata. The Acoelomorpha, which are neither protostomes nor deuterostomes, are regarded as basal bilaterians.

<text>A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream is a comedy play written by William Shakespeare in about 1595 or 1596. The play is set in Athens, and consists of several subplots that revolve around the marriage of Theseus and Hippolyta. One subplot involves a conflict among four Athenian lovers. Another follows a group of six amateur actors rehearsing the play which they are to perform before the wedding. Both groups find themselves in a forest inhabited by fairies who manipulate the humans and are engaged in their own domestic intrigue. &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; is one of Shakespeare&#x27;s most popular and widely performed plays.

==Plot ==

The play consists of several interconnecting plots, connected by a celebration of the wedding of Duke Theseus of Athens and the Amazon queen Hippolyta.
Most of the action occurs in the woodland realm of Fairyland, under the light of the moon.

=== Act 1 ===

==== Act 1 Scene 1 ====
The play opens with Theseus and Hippolyta who are four days away from their wedding. Theseus is unhappy about how long he has to wait while Hippolyta thinks it will pass by like a dream. Theseus is confronted by Egeus and his daughter Hermia, who is in love with Lysander, and resistant to her father&#x27;s demand that she marry Demetrius, whom he has arranged for her to marry. Enraged, Egeus invokes an ancient Athenian law before Duke Theseus, whereby a daughter needs to marry a suitor chosen by her father, or else face death. Theseus offers her another choice: lifelong chastity as a nun worshipping the goddess Diana, but the two lovers both deny his choice and make a secret plan to escape into the forest for Lysander&#x27;s aunt&#x27;s house, to run away from Theseus. Hermia tells their plans to Helena, her best friend, who pines unrequitedly for Demetrius, who broke up with her to be with Hermia. Desperate to reclaim Demetrius&#x27;s love, Helena tells Demetrius about the plan and he follows them in hopes of finding Hermia.

==== Act 1 Scene 2 ====
The mechanicals, Peter Quince and fellow players Nick Bottom, Francis Flute, Robin Starveling, Tom Snout and Snug plan to put on a play for the wedding of the Duke and the Queen, &quot;the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe&quot;. Quince reads the names of characters and bestows them on the players. Nick Bottom, who is playing the main role of Pyramus, is over-enthusiastic and wants to dominate others by suggesting himself for the characters of Thisbe, the Lion, and Pyramus at the same time. Quince insists that Bottom can only play the role of Pyramus. Bottom would also rather play a tyrant and recites some lines of Ercles. Bottom is told by Quince that he would play the Lion so terribly as to frighten the duchess and other ladies so much that the Duke and Lords would have the players hanged. Snug remarks that he needs Lion&#x27;s part because he is &quot;slow of study&quot;. Quince assures Snug that the role of the lion is &quot;nothing but roaring.&quot; Quince then ends the meeting by telling his actors &quot;At the Duke&#x27;s oak we meet&quot;.

=== Act 2 ===

==== Act 2 Scene 1 ====

In a parallel plot line, Oberon, king of the fairies, and Titania, his queen, have come to the forest outside Athens. Titania tells Oberon that she plans to stay there until she has attended Theseus and Hippolyta&#x27;s wedding. Oberon and Titania are estranged because Titania refuses to give her Indian changeling to Oberon for use as his &quot;knight&quot; or &quot;henchman&quot; since the child&#x27;s mother was one of Titania&#x27;s worshippers. Oberon seeks to punish Titania. He calls upon Robin &quot;Puck&quot; Goodfellow, his &quot;shrewd and knavish sprite&quot;, to help him concoct a magical juice derived from a flower called &quot;love-in-idleness&quot;, which turns from white to purple when struck by Cupid&#x27;s arrow. When the concoction is applied to the eyelids of a sleeping person, that person, upon waking, falls in love with the first living thing they perceive. He instructs Puck to retrieve the flower with the hope that he might make Titania fall in love with an animal of the forest and thereby shame her into giving up the little Indian boy. He says, &quot;And ere I take this charm from off her sight, / As I can take it with another herb, / I&#x27;ll make her render up her page to me.&quot; Helena and Demetrius enter, with her continuously making advances towards Demetrius, promising to love him more than Hermia. However, he rebuffs her with cruel insults. Observing this, Oberon orders Puck to spread some of the magical juice from the flower on the eyelids of the young Athenian man.

==== Act 2 Scene 2 ====
As Titania is lulled to sleep by her fairies, Oberon sneaks up and places the flower juice on her eyes, exiting the stage afterwards. Lysander and Hermia enter, lost and exhausted from the journey. Hermia rejects Lysander&#x27;s advances to sleep together, and the two lie down on different corners. Puck enters and mistakes Lysander for Demetrius, not having seen either before, and administers the juice to the sleeping Lysander. Helena, coming across him, wakes him while attempting to determine whether he is dead or asleep. Upon this happening, Lysander immediately falls in love with Helena. Helena, thinking Lysander is mocking her, runs away. Lysander follows her. When Hermia wakes up after dreaming a snake ate her heart, she sees that Lysander is gone and goes out in the woods to find him.

=== Act 3 ===

==== Act 3 Scene 1 ====

Meanwhile, Quince and his band of five labourers (&quot;rude mechanicals&quot;, as Puck describes them) have arranged to perform their play about Pyramus and Thisbe for Theseus&#x27;s wedding and venture into the forest, near Titania&#x27;s bower, for their rehearsal. Quince leads the actors in their rehearsal of the play. Bottom is spotted by Puck, who (taking his name to be another word for a jackass) transforms his head into that of a donkey. When Bottom returns for his next lines, the other workmen run screaming in terror: They claim that they are haunted, much to Bottom&#x27;s confusion. Determined to await his friends, he begins to sing to himself. Titania, having received the love potion, is awakened by Bottom&#x27;s singing and immediately falls in love with him. (In the words of the play, &quot;Titania waked, and straightway loved an ass.&quot;) She lavishes him with the attention of her and her fairies, and while she is in this state of devotion, Oberon takes the changeling boy.

==== Act 3 Scene 2 ====

Oberon sees Demetrius still following Hermia. When Demetrius goes to sleep, Oberon condemns Puck&#x27;s mistake and sends him to get Helena while he charms Demetrius&#x27;s eyes. Upon waking, he sees Helena arguing with Lysander, and instantly falls in love with her. Now under the spell, the two men are both in love with her. However, Helena is convinced that her two suitors are mocking her, as neither loved her originally. Hermia finds Lysander and asks why he left her, but Lysander claims he never loved Hermia, instead loving Helena. This soon turns into a quarrel between the two ladies, with Helena chiding Hermia for joining in the mockery session, followed by the latter furiously charging at her for stealing her true love&#x27;s heart and blaming her for the supposed &#x27;mockery&#x27;. Oberon and Puck decide that they must resolve this conflict, and by the morning, none of them will have any memory of what happened, as if it were a dream. Oberon arranges everything so Helena, Hermia, Demetrius, and Lysander will all believe they have been dreaming when they awaken. Puck distracts Lysander and Demetrius from fighting over Helena&#x27;s love by mimicking their voices and leading them apart. Eventually, all four find themselves separately falling asleep in the glade. Once they fall asleep, Puck administers the love potion to Lysander again, returning his love to Hermia again, and cast another spell over the four Athenian lovers, claiming all will be well in the morning. Once they awaken, the lovers assume that whatever happened was a dream and not reality.

=== Act 4 ===

==== Act 4 Scene 1 ====
Having achieved his goals, Oberon releases Titania and orders Puck to remove the donkey&#x27;s head from Bottom. The fairies then disappear, and Theseus and Hippolyta arrive on the scene, during an early morning hunt. They find the lovers still sleeping in the glade. They wake up the lovers and, since Demetrius no longer loves Hermia, Theseus over-rules Egeus&#x27;s demands and arranges a group wedding. The lovers at first believe they are still in a dream and cannot recall what has happened. The lovers decide that the night&#x27;s events must have been a dream, as they walk back to Athens.

==== Act 4 Scene 2 ====
After they exit, Bottom awakes, and he too decides that he must have experienced a dream &quot;past the wit of man&quot;. At Quince&#x27;s house, Quince and his team of actors worry that Bottom has gone missing. Quince laments that Bottom is the only man who can take on the lead role of Pyramus. Bottom returns and the actors get ready to put on &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot;.

===Act 5 ===
In the final scene of the play, Theseus, Hippolyta and the lovers watch the six workmen perform &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot; in Athens. The mechanicals are so terrible at playing their roles that the guests laugh as if it were meant to be a comedy, and everyone retires to bed. Afterwards, Oberon, Titania, Puck, and other fairies enter, and bless the house and its occupants with good fortune. After all the other characters leave, Puck &quot;restores amends&quot; and suggests that what the audience experienced might just be a dream.

==Sources==

It is unknown exactly when &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; was written or first performed, but on the basis of topical references and an allusion to Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Epithalamion&quot;, it is usually dated 1595 or early 1596. Some have theorised that the play might have been written for an aristocratic wedding (for example that of Thomas Berkeley and Elizabeth Carey), while others suggest that it was written for the Queen to celebrate the feast day of St. John, but no evidence exists to support this theory. In any case, it would have been performed at The Theatre and, later, The Globe. Though it is not a translation or adaptation of an earlier work, various sources such as Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; and Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; served as inspiration. Aristophanes&#x27; classical Greek comedy &quot;The Birds&quot; (also set in the countryside near Athens) has been proposed as a source due to the fact that both Procne and Titania are awakened by male characters (Hoopoe and Bottom the Weaver) who have animal heads and who sing two-stanza songs about birds. According to John Twyning, the play&#x27;s plot of four lovers undergoing a trial in the woods was intended as a &quot;riff&quot; on &quot;Der Busant&quot;, a Middle High German poem.

According to Dorothea Kehler, the writing period can be placed between 1594 and 1596, which means that Shakespeare had probably already completed &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and was still in contemplation of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. The play belongs to the author&#x27;s early-middle period, a time when Shakespeare devoted primary attention to the lyricism of his works.

==Date and text==

The play was entered into the Register of the Stationers&#x27; Company on 8 October 1600 by the bookseller Thomas Fisher, who published the first quarto edition later that year. A second quarto was printed in 1619 by William Jaggard, as part of his so-called False Folio. The play next appeared in print in the First Folio of 1623. The title page of Q1 states that the play was &quot;sundry times publickely acted&quot; prior to 1600. According to Sukanta Chaudhuri, editor of the 2017 Arden edition of A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream, &quot;The only firm evidence for the date of Dream is its mention in Francis Meres&#x27;s Palladis Tamia, which appeared in 1598&quot; (p. 283). Chaudhuri&#x27;s exhaustive investigation of its original date of performance points to 1595 or 1596 (likely for the wedding of either William Stanley, sixth Earl of Derby to Elizabeth de Vere, or Thomas Berkeley, son of Henry Lord Berkeley, to Elizabeth Carey) (p. 284-5). Further consolidations of this late Elizabethan date are provided by &quot;Oberon&#x27;s unmissable compliment to Queen Elizabeth (2.1.155-164)&quot; (Chaudhuri), and Titania&#x27;s description of flooded fields and failed crops which occurred through England in the years 1594-1597/8 (2.1.84-121). The first court performance known with certainty occurred at Hampton Court on 1 January 1604, as a prelude to &quot;The Masque of Indian and China Knights&quot;.

==Themes ==

===Lovers&#x27; bliss===
In Ancient Greece, long before the creation of the Christian celebrations of St. John&#x27;s Day, the summer solstice was marked by Adonia, a festival to mourn the death of Adonis, the devoted mortal lover of the goddess Aphrodite. According to Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Aphrodite took the orphaned infant Adonis to the underworld to be raised by Persephone. He grew to be a beautiful young man, and when Aphrodite returned to retrieve him, Persephone did not want to let him go. Zeus settled the dispute by giving Adonis one-third of the year with Persephone, one-third of the year with Aphrodite, and the remaining third where he chose. Adonis chose to spend two-thirds of the year with his paramour, Aphrodite. He bled to death in his lover&#x27;s arms after being gored by a boar. Mythology has various stories attributing the colour of certain flowers to staining by the blood of Adonis or Aphrodite.

The story of Venus and Adonis was well known to the Elizabethans and inspired many works, including Shakespeare&#x27;s own hugely popular narrative poem, &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;, written while London&#x27;s theatres were closed because of plague. It was published in 1593.

The wedding of Theseus and Hippolyta and the mistaken and waylaid lovers, Titania and Bottom, even the erstwhile acting troupe, model various aspects (and forms) of love.

===Carnivalesque===
Both David Wiles of the University of London and Harold Bloom of Yale University have strongly endorsed the reading of this play under the themes of Carnivalesque, Bacchanalia, and Saturnalia. Writing in 1998, David Wiles stated that: &quot;The starting point for my own analysis will be the proposition that although we encounter &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; as a text, it was historically part of an aristocratic carnival. It was written for a wedding, and part of the festive structure of the wedding night. The audience who saw the play in the public theatre in the months that followed became vicarious participants in an aristocratic festival from which they were physically excluded. My purpose will be to demonstrate how closely the play is integrated with a historically specific upper-class celebration.&quot; Wiles argued in 1993 that the play was written to celebrate the Carey-Berkeley wedding. The date of the wedding was fixed to coincide with a conjunction of Venus and the new moon, highly propitious for conceiving an heir.

===Love===

David Bevington argues that the play represents the dark side of love. He writes that the fairies make light of love by mistaking the lovers and by applying a love potion to Queen Titania&#x27;s eyes, forcing her to fall in love with an ass. In the forest, both couples are beset by problems. Hermia and Lysander are both met by Puck, who provides some comic relief in the play by confounding the four lovers in the forest. However, the play also alludes to serious themes. At the end of the play, Hippolyta and Theseus, happily married, watch the play about the unfortunate lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe, and are able to enjoy and laugh at it. Helena and Demetrius are both oblivious to the dark side of their love, totally unaware of what may have come of the events in the forest.

===Problem with time===
There is a dispute over the scenario of the play as it is cited at first by Theseus that &quot;four happy days bring in another moon&quot;. The wood episode then takes place at a night of no Moon, but Lysander asserts that &quot;there will be so much light in the very night they will escape that dew on the grass will be shining like liquid pearls.&quot; Also, in the next scene, Quince states that they will rehearse in moonlight, which creates a real confusion. It is possible that the Moon set during the night allowing Lysander to escape in the moonlight and for the actors to rehearse, then for the wood episode to occur without moonlight. Theseus&#x27;s statement can also be interpreted to mean &quot;four days until the next month&quot;. Another possibility is that, since each month there are roughly four consecutive nights that the Moon is not seen due to its closeness to the Sun in the sky (the two nights before the moment of new moon, followed by the two following it), it may in this fashion indicate a liminal &quot;dark of the moon&quot; period full of magical possibilities. This is further supported by Hippolyta&#x27;s opening lines exclaiming &quot;And then the moon, like to a silver bow New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night of our solemnities.&quot;; the thin crescent-shaped moon being the hallmark of the new moon&#x27;s return to the skies each month. The play also intertwines the Midsummer Eve of the title with May Day, furthering the idea of a confusion of time and the seasons. This is evidenced by Theseus commenting on some slumbering youths, that they &quot;observe The rite of May&quot;.

===Loss of individual identity===

Maurice Hunt, former Chair of the English Department at Baylor University, writes of the blurring of the identities of fantasy and reality in the play that make possible &quot;that pleasing, narcotic dreaminess associated with the fairies of the play&quot;. By emphasising this theme, even in the setting of the play, Shakespeare prepares the reader&#x27;s mind to accept the fantastic reality of the fairy world and its happenings. This also seems to be the axis around which the plot conflicts in the play occur. Hunt suggests that it is the breaking down of individual identities that leads to the central conflict in the story. It is the brawl between Oberon and Titania, based on a lack of recognition for the other in the relationship, that drives the rest of the drama in the story and makes it dangerous for any of the other lovers to come together due to the disturbance of Nature caused by a fairy dispute. Similarly, this failure to identify and to distinguish is what leads Puck to mistake one set of lovers for another in the forest, placing the flower&#x27;s juice on Lysander&#x27;s eyes instead of Demetrius&#x27;.

Victor Kiernan, a Marxist scholar and historian, writes that it is for the greater sake of love that this loss of identity takes place and that individual characters are made to suffer accordingly: &quot;It was the more extravagant cult of love that struck sensible people as irrational, and likely to have dubious effects on its acolytes.&quot; He believes that identities in the play are not so much lost as they are blended together to create a type of haze through which distinction becomes nearly impossible. It is driven by a desire for new and more practical ties between characters as a means of coping with the strange world within the forest, even in relationships as diverse and seemingly unrealistic as the brief love between Titania and Bottom: &quot;It was the tidal force of this social need that lent energy to relationships.&quot;

The aesthetics scholar David Marshall draws out this theme even further by noting that the loss of identity reaches its fullness in the description of the mechanicals and their assumption of other identities. In describing the occupations of the acting troupe, he writes &quot;Two construct or put together, two mend and repair, one weaves and one sews. All join together what is apart or mend what has been rent, broken, or sundered.&quot; In Marshall&#x27;s opinion, this loss of individual identity not only blurs specificities, it creates new identities found in community, which Marshall points out may lead to some understanding of Shakespeare&#x27;s opinions on love and marriage. Further, the mechanicals understand this theme as they take on their individual parts for a corporate performance of Pyramus and Thisbe. Marshall remarks that &quot;To be an actor is to double and divide oneself, to discover oneself in two parts: both oneself and not oneself, both the part and not the part.&quot; He claims that the mechanicals understand this and that each character, particularly among the lovers, has a sense of laying down individual identity for the greater benefit of the group or pairing. It seems that a desire to lose one&#x27;s individuality and find identity in the love of another is what quietly moves the events of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. As the primary sense of motivation, this desire is reflected even in the scenery depictions and the story&#x27;s overall mood.

===Ambiguous sexuality===

In his essay &quot;Preposterous Pleasures: Queer Theories and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;,&quot; Douglas E. Green explores possible interpretations of alternative sexuality that he finds within the text of the play, in juxtaposition to the proscribed social mores of the culture at the time the play was written. He writes that his essay &quot;does not (seek to) rewrite &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; as a gay play but rather explores some of its &#x27;homoerotic significations&#x27; ... moments of &#x27;queer&#x27; disruption and eruption in this Shakespearean comedy.&quot;

Green does not consider Shakespeare to have been a &quot;sexual radical&quot;, but that the play represented a &quot;topsy-turvy world&quot; or &quot;temporary holiday&quot; that mediates or negotiates the &quot;discontents of civilisation&quot;, which while resolved neatly in the story&#x27;s conclusion, do not resolve so neatly in real life. Green writes that the &quot;sodomitical elements&quot;, &quot;homoeroticism&quot;, &quot;lesbianism&quot;, and even &quot;compulsory heterosexuality&quot;—the first hint of which may be Oberon&#x27;s obsession with Titania&#x27;s changeling ward—in the story must be considered in the context of the &quot;culture of early modern England&quot; as a commentary on the &quot;aesthetic rigidities of comic form and political ideologies of the prevailing order&quot;.

===Gender roles===

Male dominance is one thematic element found in the play. In &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, Lysander and Hermia escape into the woods for a night where they do not fall under the laws of Theseus or Egeus. Upon their arrival in Athens, the couples are married. Marriage is seen as the ultimate social achievement for women while men can go on to do many other great things and gain social recognition. In &quot;The Imperial Votaress&quot;, Louis Montrose draws attention to male and female gender roles and norms present in the comedy in connection with Elizabethan culture. In reference to the triple wedding, he says, &quot;The festive conclusion in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; depends upon the success of a process by which the feminine pride and power manifested in Amazon warriors, possessive mothers, unruly wives, and wilful daughters are brought under the control of lords and husbands.&quot; He says that the consummation of marriage is how power over a woman changes hands from father to husband. A connection is drawn between flowers and sexuality. Montrose sees the juice employed by Oberon as symbolising menstrual blood as well as the &quot;sexual blood shed by &#x27;virgins&#x27;&quot;. While blood as a result of menstruation is representative of a woman&#x27;s power, blood as a result of a first sexual encounter represents man&#x27;s power over women.

There are points in the play, however, when there is an absence of patriarchal control. In his book &quot;Power on Display&quot;, Leonard Tennenhouse says the problem in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; is the problem of &quot;authority gone archaic&quot;. The Athenian law requiring a daughter to die if she does not do her father&#x27;s will is outdated. Tennenhouse contrasts the patriarchal rule of Theseus in Athens with that of Oberon in the carnivalistic Faerie world. The disorder in the land of the fairies completely opposes the world of Athens. He states that during times of carnival and festival, male power is broken down. For example, what happens to the four lovers in the woods as well as Bottom&#x27;s dream represents chaos that contrasts with Theseus&#x27; political order. However, Theseus does not punish the lovers for their disobedience. According to Tennenhouse, by forgiving the lovers, he has made a distinction between the law of the patriarch (Egeus) and that of the monarch (Theseus), creating two different voices of authority. This can be compared to the time of Elizabeth I, in which monarchs were seen as having two bodies: the body natural and the body politic. Tennenhouse says that Elizabeth&#x27;s succession itself represented both the voice of a patriarch and the voice of a monarch: (1) her father&#x27;s will, which stated that the crown should pass to her and (2) the fact that she was the daughter of a king.

==Criticism and interpretation==

===Critical history===

====17th century====

Dorothea Kehler has attempted to trace the criticism of the work through the centuries. The earliest such piece of criticism that she found was a 1662 entry in the diary of Samuel Pepys. He found the play to be &quot;the most insipid ridiculous play that ever I saw in my life&quot;. He did, however, admit that it had &quot;some good dancing and some handsome women, which was all my pleasure&quot;.

The next critic known to comment on the play was John Dryden, writing &quot;The Authors Apology for Heroique Poetry; and Poetique Licence&quot; in 1677. He was preoccupied with the question of whether fairies should be depicted in theatrical plays, since they did not exist. He concluded that poets should be allowed to depict things which do not exist but derive from popular belief. And fairies are of this sort, as are pygmies and the extraordinary effects of magic. Based on this reasoning, Dryden defended the merits of three fantasy plays: &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;The Tempest&quot;, and Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;The Masque of Queens&quot;.

====18th century====
Charles Gildon in the early 18th century recommended this play for its beautiful reflections, descriptions, similes, and topics. Gildon thought that Shakespeare drew inspiration from the works of Ovid and Virgil, and that he could read them in the original Latin and not in later translations.

William Duff, writing in the 1770s, also recommended this play. He felt the depiction of the supernatural was among Shakespeare&#x27;s strengths, not weaknesses. He especially praised the poetry and wit of the fairies, and the quality of the verse involved. His contemporary Francis Gentleman, an admirer of Shakespeare, was much less appreciative of this play. He felt that the poetry, the characterisation, and the originality of the play were its strengths, but that its major weaknesses were a &quot;puerile&quot; plot and that it consists of an odd mixture of incidents. The connection of the incidents to each other seemed rather forced to Gentleman.

Edmond Malone, a Shakespearean scholar and critic of the late 18th century, found another supposed flaw in this particular play, its lack of a proper decorum. He found that the &quot;more exalted characters&quot; (the aristocrats of Athens) are subservient to the interests of those beneath them. In other words, the lower-class characters play larger roles than their betters and overshadow them. He found this to be a grave error of the writer. Malone thought that this play had to be an early and immature work of Shakespeare and, by implication, that an older writer would know better. Malone&#x27;s main argument seems to derive from the classism of his era. He assumes that the aristocrats had to receive more attention in the narrative and to be more important, more distinguished, and better than the lower class.

====19th century====

According to Kehler, significant 19th-century criticism began in 1808 with August Wilhelm Schlegel. Schlegel perceived unity in the multiple plot lines. He noted that the donkey&#x27;s head is not a random transformation, but reflects Bottom&#x27;s true nature. He identified the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe as a burlesque of the Athenian lovers. In 1817, William Hazlitt found the play to be better as a written work than a staged production. He found the work to be &quot;a delightful fiction&quot; but when staged, it is reduced to a dull pantomime. He concluded that poetry and the stage do not fit together. Kehler finds the comment to be more of an indication of the quality of the theatrical productions available to Hazlitt, rather than a true indication of the play&#x27;s supposed unsuitability to the stage. She notes that prior to the 1840s, all stage productions of this play were adaptations unfaithful to the original text.

In 1811–1812, Samuel Taylor Coleridge made two points of criticism about this play. The first was that the entire play should be seen as a dream. Second, that Helena is guilty of &quot;ungrateful treachery&quot; to Hermia. He thought that this was a reflection of the lack of principles in women, who are more likely to follow their own passions and inclinations than men. Women, in his view, feel less abhorrence for moral evil, though they are concerned with its outward consequences. Coleridge was probably the earliest critic to introduce gender issues to the analysis of this play. Kehler dismisses his views on Helena as indications of Coleridge&#x27;s own misogyny, rather than genuine reflections of Helena&#x27;s morality.
In 1837, William Maginn produced essays on the play. He turned his attention to Theseus&#x27; speech about &quot;the lunatic, the lover, and the poet&quot; and to Hippolyta&#x27;s response to it. He regarded Theseus as the voice of Shakespeare himself and the speech as a call for imaginative audiences. He also viewed Bottom as a lucky man on whom Fortune showered favours beyond measure. He was particularly amused by the way Bottom reacts to the love of the fairy queen: completely unfazed. Maginn argued that &quot;Theseus would have bent in reverent awe before Titania. Bottom treats her as carelessly as if she were the wench of the next-door tapster.&quot; Finally, Maginn thought that Oberon should not be blamed for Titania&#x27;s humiliation, which is the result of an accident. He viewed Oberon as angry with the &quot;caprices&quot; of his queen, but unable to anticipate that her charmed affections would be reserved for a weaver with a donkey&#x27;s head.

In 1839, the philosopher Hermann Ulrici wrote that the play and its depiction of human life reflected the views of Platonism. In his view, Shakespeare implied that human life is nothing but a dream, suggesting influence from Plato and his followers who thought human reality is deprived of all genuine existence. Ulrici noted the way Theseus and Hippolyta behave here, like ordinary people. He agreed with Malone that this did not fit their stations in life, but viewed this behaviour as an indication of parody about class differences.

James Halliwell-Phillipps, writing in the 1840s, found that there were many inconsistencies in the play, but considered it the most beautiful poetical drama ever written.

In 1849, Charles Knight also wrote about the play and its apparent lack of proper social stratification. He thought that this play indicated Shakespeare&#x27;s maturity as a playwright, and that its &quot;Thesean harmony&quot; reflects proper decorum of character. He also viewed Bottom as the best-drawn character, with his self-confidence, authority, and self-love. He argued that Bottom stands as a representative of the whole human race. Like Hazlitt he felt that the work is best appreciated when read as a text, rather than acted on stage. He found the writing to be &quot;subtle and ethereal&quot;, and standing above literary criticism and its reductive reasoning.

Also in 1849, Georg Gottfried Gervinus wrote extensively about the play. He denied the theory that this play should be seen as a dream. He argued that it should be seen as an ethical construct and an allegory. He thought that it was an allegorical depiction of the errors of sensual love, which is likened to a dream. In his view, Hermia lacks in filial obedience and acts as if devoid of conscience when she runs away with Lysander. Lysander is also guilty for disobeying and mocking his prospective father-in-law. Pyramus and Thisbe also lack in filial obedience, since they &quot;woo by moonlight&quot; behind their parents&#x27; backs. The fairies, in his view, should be seen as &quot;personified dream gods&quot;. They represent the caprices of superficial love, and they lack in intellect, feeling, and ethics.

Gervinus also wrote on where the fairyland of the play is located. Not in Attica, but in the Indies. His views on the Indies seem to Kehler to be influenced by Orientalism. He speaks of the Indies as scented with the aroma of flowers, and as the place where mortals live in the state of a half-dream. Gervinus denies and devalues the loyalty of Titania to her friend. He views this supposed friendship as not grounded in spiritual association. Titania merely &quot;delight[s] in her beauty, her &#x27;swimming gait,&#x27; and her powers of imitation&quot;. Gervinus further views Titania as an immoral character for not trying to reconcile with her husband. In her resentment, Titania seeks separation from him, for which Gervinus blames her.

Gervinus wrote with elitist disdain about the mechanicals of the play and their acting aspirations. He described them as homely creatures with &quot;hard hands and thick heads&quot;. They are, in his view, ignorant men who compose and act in plays merely for financial reward. They are not real artists. Gervinus reserves his praise and respect only for Theseus, who he thinks represents the intellectual man. Like several of his predecessors, Gervinus thought that this work should be read as a text and not acted on stage.

In 1863, Charles Cowden Clarke also wrote on this play. Kehler notes he was the husband of famous Shakespearean scholar Mary Cowden Clarke. Charles was more appreciative of the lower-class mechanicals of the play. He commented favourably on their individualisation and their collective richness of character. He thought that Bottom was conceited but good natured, and shows a considerable store of imagination in his interaction with the representatives of the fairy world. He also argued that Bottom&#x27;s conceit was a quality inseparable from his secondary profession, that of an actor.

In 1872, Henry N. Hudson, an American clergyman and editor of Shakespeare, also wrote comments on this play. Kehler pays little attention to his writings, as they were largely derivative of previous works. She notes, however, that Hudson too believed that the play should be viewed as a dream. He cited the lightness of the characterisation as supporting of his view. In 1881, Edward Dowden argued that Theseus and his reflections on art are central to the play. He also argued that Theseus was one of the &quot;heroic men of action&quot; so central to Shakespeare&#x27;s theatrical works.

Both Horace Howard Furness and Henry Austin Clapp were more concerned with the problem of the play&#x27;s duration, though they held opposing views. Clapp, writing in 1885, commented on the inconsistency of the time depicted in the play, as it should take place in four days and nights and seems to last less than two, and felt that this added to the unrealistic quality of the play. Furness, defending the play in 1895, felt that the apparent inconsistency did not detract from the play&#x27;s quality.

In 1887, Denton Jacques Snider argued that the play should be read as a dialectic, either between understanding and imagination or between prose and poetry. He also viewed the play as representing three phases or movements. The first is the Real World of the play, which represents reason. The second is the Fairy World, an ideal world which represents imagination and the supernatural. The third is their representation in art, where the action is self-reflective. Snider viewed Titania and her caprice as solely to blame for her marital strife with Oberon. She therefore deserves punishment, and Oberon is a dutiful husband who provides her with one. For failing to live in peace with Oberon and her kind, Titania is sentenced to fall in love with a human. And this human, unlike Oberon is a &quot;horrid brute&quot;.

Towards the end of the 19th century, Georg Brandes (1895–6) and Frederick S. Boas (1896) were the last major additions to &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; criticism. Brandes&#x27; approach anticipates later psychological readings, seeing Oberon&#x27;s magic as symbolic and &quot;typifying the sorcery of the erotic imagination&quot;. Brandes felt that in the play, Shakespeare looks inward at the &quot;domain of the unconscious&quot;. Boas eschews the play as ethical treatise or psychological study and instead takes a more historicist and literal approach. To Boas the play is, despite its fantastical and exotic trappings, &quot;essentially English and Elizabethan&quot;. He sees Theseus as a Tudor noble; Helena a mere plot device to &quot;concentrate the four lovers on a single spot&quot;; and the &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot; play-within-the-play a parody of a prominent &quot;topos&quot; of contemporary plays. Summing up their contributions, Kehler writes: &quot;This is recognizably modern criticism.&quot;

====20th century====
The 20th century brought new insights into the play. In 1961, Elizabeth Sewell argued that Shakespeare aligns himself not with the aristocrats of the play, but with Bottom and the artisans. It is their task to produce a wedding entertainment, precisely the purpose of the writer on working in this play. Also in 1961, Frank Kermode wrote on the themes of the play and their literary sources. He counted among them fantasy, blind love, and divine love. He traced these themes to the works of Macrobius, Apuleius, and Giordano Bruno. Bottom also briefly alludes to a passage from the First Epistle to the Corinthians by Paul the Apostle, dealing with divine love.

In 1964, R.W. Dent argued against theories that the exemplary model of love in the play is the rational love of Theseus and Hippolyta. He argued that in this work, love is inexplicable. It is the offspring of imagination, not reason. However the exemplary love of the play is one of an imagination controlled and restrained, and avoids the excesses of &quot;dotage&quot;. Genuine love is contrasted with the unrequited love (and dotage) of Demetrius for Hermia, and with the supposed love (and dotage) of Titania for an unworthy object.

Dent also denied the rationality and wisdom typically attributed to Theseus. He reminded his readers that this is the character of Theseus from Greek mythology, a creation himself of &quot;antique fable&quot;. Theseus&#x27; views on art are far from rational or wise. He cannot tell the difference between an actual play and its interlude. The interlude of the play&#x27;s acting troop is less about the art and more of an expression of the mechanicals&#x27; distrust of their own audience. They fear the audience reactions will be either excessive or inadequate, and say so on stage. Theseus fails to get the message.

Also in 1964, Jan Kott offered his own views on the play. He saw the main themes of the play as being violence and &quot;unrepressed animalistic sexuality&quot;. Both Lysander and Demetrius are, in his view, verbally brutal lovers, whose love interests are exchangeable and objectified. The changeling that Oberon desires is his new &quot;sexual toy&quot;. The aristocrats of the play, both mortal and immortal, are promiscuous. As for the Athenian lovers following their night in the forest, they are ashamed to talk about it because that night liberated them from themselves and social norms, and allowed them to reveal their real selves. Kott&#x27;s views were controversial, and contemporary critics wrote either in favour of or against his ideas, but few ignored them.

In 1967, John A. Allen theorised that Bottom is a symbol of the animalistic aspect of humanity. He also thought Bottom was redeemed through the maternal tenderness of Titania, which allowed him to understand the love and self-sacrifice of Pyramus and Thisbe. In 1968, Stephen Fender offered his own views on the play. He emphasised the &quot;terrifying power&quot; of the fairies and argued that they control the play&#x27;s events. They are the most powerful figures featured, not Theseus as often thought. He also emphasised the ethically ambivalent characters of the play. Finally, Fender noted a layer of complexity in the play. Theseus, Hippolyta, and Bottom have contradictory reactions to the events of the night, and each has partly valid reasons for their reactions, implying that the puzzles offered to the play&#x27;s audience can have no singular answer or meaning.

In 1969, Michael Taylor argued that previous critics offered a too cheerful view of what the play depicts. He emphasised the less pleasant aspects of the otherwise appealing fairies and the nastiness of the mortal Demetrius prior to his enchantment. He argued that the overall themes are the often painful aspects of love and the pettiness of people, which here include the fairies.

In 1970, R. A. Zimbardo viewed the play as full of symbols. The Moon and its phases alluded to in the play, in his view, stand for permanence in mutability. The play uses the principle of &quot;discordia concors&quot; in several of its key scenes. Theseus and Hippolyta represent marriage and, symbolically, the reconciliation of the natural seasons or the phases of time. Hippolyta&#x27;s story arc is that she must submit to Theseus and become a matron. Titania has to give up her motherly obsession with the changeling boy and passes through a symbolic death, and Oberon has to once again woo and win his wife. Kehler notes that Zimbardo took for granted the female subordination within the obligatory marriage, social views that were already challenged in the 1960s.

In 1971, James L. Calderwood offered a new view on the role of Oberon. He viewed the king as specialising in the arts of illusion. Oberon, in his view, is the interior dramatist of the play, orchestrating events. He is responsible for the play&#x27;s happy ending, when he influences Theseus to overrule Egeus and allow the lovers to marry. Oberon and Theseus bring harmony out of discord. He also suggested that the lovers&#x27; identities, which are blurred and lost in the forest, recall the unstable identities of the actors who constantly change roles. In fact the failure of the artisans&#x27; play is based on their chief flaw as actors: they can not lose their own identities to even temporarily replace them with those of their fictional roles.

Also in 1971, Andrew D. Weiner argued that the play&#x27;s actual theme is unity. The poet&#x27;s imagination creates unity by giving form to diverse elements, and the writer is addressing the spectator&#x27;s own imagination which also creates and perceives unity. Weiner connected this unity to the concept of uniformity, and in turn viewed this as Shakespeare&#x27;s allusion to the &quot;eternal truths&quot; of Platonism and Christianity.

Also writing in 1971, Hugh M. Richmond offered an entirely new view of the play&#x27;s love story lines. He argued that what passes for love in this play is actually a self-destructive expression of passion. He argued that the play&#x27;s significant characters are all affected by passion and by a sadomasochistic type of sexuality. This passion prevents the lovers from genuinely communicating with each other. At the same time it protects them from the disenchantment with the love interest that communication inevitably brings. The exception to the rule is Bottom, who is chiefly devoted to himself. His own egotism protects him from feeling passion for anyone else. Richmond also noted that there are parallels between the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe, featured in this play, and that of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

In 1971, Neil Taylor argued that there was a double time-scheme in the play, making it seem to last a minimum of four nights but to also be timeless.

In 1972, Ralph Berry argued that Shakespeare was chiefly concerned with epistemology in this play. The lovers declare illusion to be reality, the actors declare reality to be illusion. The play ultimately reconciles the seemingly opposing views and vindicates imagination. Also in 1972, Thomas McFarland argued that the play is dominated by a mood of happiness and that it is one of the happiest literary creations ever produced. The mood is so lovely that the audience never feels fear or worry about the fate of the characters.

In 1974, Marjorie Garber argued that metamorphosis is both the major subject of the play and the model of its structure. She noted that in this play, the entry in the woods is a dream-like change in perception, a change which affects both the characters and the audience. Dreams here take priority over reason, and are truer than the reality they seek to interpret and transform. Also in 1974, Alexander Leggatt offered his own reading of the play. He was certain that there are grimmer elements in the play, but they are overlooked because the audience focuses on the story of the sympathetic young lovers. He viewed the characters as separated into four groups which interact in various ways. Among the four, the fairies stand as the most sophisticated and unconstrained. The contrasts between the interacting groups produce the play&#x27;s comic perspective.

In 1975, Ronald F. Miller expresses his view that the play is a study in the epistemology of imagination. He focused on the role of the fairies, who have a mysterious aura of evanescence and ambiguity. Also in 1975, David Bevington offered his own reading of the play. He in part refuted the ideas of Jan Kott concerning the sexuality of Oberon and the fairies. He pointed that Oberon may be bisexual and his desire for the changeling boy may be sexual in nature, as Kott suggested. But there is little textual evidence to support this, as the writer left ambiguous clues concerning the idea of love among the fairies. He concluded that therefore their love life is &quot;unknowable and incomprehensible&quot;. According to Bevington, the main theme of the play is the conflict between sexual desire and rational restraint, an essential tension reflected throughout the play. It is the tension between the dark and benevolent sides of love, which are reconciled in the end.

In 1977, Anne Paolucci argued that the play lasts five days.

In 1979, M. E. Lamb suggested that the play may have borrowed an aspect of the ancient myth of Theseus: the Athenian&#x27;s entry into the Labyrinth of the Minotaur. The woods of the play serve as a metaphorical labyrinth, and for Elizabethans the woods were often an allegory of sexual sin. The lovers in the woods conquer irrational passion and find their way back. Bottom with his animal head becomes a comical version of the Minotaur. Bottom also becomes Ariadne&#x27;s thread which guides the lovers. In having the new Minotaur rescue rather than threaten the lovers, the classical myth is comically inverted. Theseus himself is the bridegroom of the play who has left the labyrinth and promiscuity behind, having conquered his passion. The artisans may stand in for the master craftsman of the myth, and builder of the Labyrinth, Daedalus. Even Theseus&#x27; best known speech in the play, which connects the poet with the lunatic and the lover may be another metaphor of the lover. It is a challenge for the poet to confront the irrationality he shares with lovers and lunatics, accepting the risks of entering the labyrinth.

Also in 1979, Harold F. Brooks agreed that the main theme of the play, its very heart, is desire and its culmination in marriage. All other subjects are of lesser importance, including that of imagination and that of appearance and reality. In 1980, Florence Falk offered a view of the play based on theories of cultural anthropology. She argued that the play is about traditional rites of passage, which trigger development within the individual and society. Theseus has detached himself from imagination and rules Athens harshly. The lovers flee from the structure of his society to the &quot;communitas&quot; of the woods. The woods serve here as the &quot;communitas&quot;, a temporary aggregate for persons whose asocial desires require accommodation to preserve the health of society. This is the rite of passage where the asocial can be contained. Falk identified this &quot;communitas&quot; with the woods, with the unconscious, with the dream space. She argued that the lovers experience release into self-knowledge and then return to the renewed Athens. This is &quot;societas&quot;, the resolution of the dialectic between the dualism of &quot;communitas&quot; and structure.

Also in 1980, Christian critic R. Chris Hassel, Jr. offered a Christian view of the play. The experience of the lovers and that of Bottom (as expressed in his awakening speech) teach them &quot;a new humility, a healthy sense of folly&quot;. They realise that there are things that are true despite the fact that they can not be seen or understood. They just learned a lesson of faith. Hassel also thought that Theseus&#x27; speech on the lunatic, the lover, and the poet is an applause to imagination. But it is also a laughing rejection of futile attempts to perceive, categorise, or express it.

Some of the interpretations of the play have been based on psychology and its diverse theories. In 1972, Alex Aronson argued that Theseus represents the conscious mind and Puck represents the unconscious mind. Puck, in this view, is a guise of the unconscious as a trickster, while remaining subservient to Oberon. Aronson thought that the play explores unauthorised desire and linked it to the concept of fertility. He viewed the donkey and the trees as fertility symbols. The lovers&#x27; sexual desires are symbolised in their forest encounters. In 1973, Melvin Goldstein argued that the lovers can not simply return to Athens and wed. First, they have to pass through stages of madness (multiple disguises), and discover their &quot;authentic sexual selves&quot;. In 1979, Norman N. Holland applied psychoanalytic literary criticism to the play. He interpreted the dream of Hermia as if it was a real dream. In his view, the dream uncovers the phases of Hermia&#x27;s sexual development. Her search for options is her defence mechanism. She both desires Lysander and wants to retain her virginity.

In 1981, Mordecai Marcus argued for a new meaning of Eros (Love) and Thanatos (Death) in this play. In his view, Shakespeare suggests that love requires the risk of death. Love achieves force and direction from the interweaving of the life impulse with the deathward-release of sexual tension. He also viewed the play as suggesting that the healing force of love is connected to the acceptance of death, and vice versa.

In 1987, Jan Lawson Hinely argued that this play has a therapeutic value. Shakespeare in many ways explores the sexual fears of the characters, releases them, and transforms them. And the happy ending is the reestablishment of social harmony. Patriarchy itself is also challenged and transformed, as the men offer their women a loving equality, one founded on respect and trust. She even viewed Titania&#x27;s loving acceptance of the donkey-headed Bottom as a metaphor for basic trust. This trust is what enables the warring and uncertain lovers to achieve their sexual maturity. In 1988, Allen Dunn argued that the play is an exploration of the characters&#x27; fears and desires, and that its structure is based on a series of sexual clashes.

In 1991, Barbara Freedman argued that the play justifies the ideological formation of absolute monarchy, and makes visible for examination the maintenance process of hegemonic order.

==Performance history==
===17th and 18th centuries===
During the years of the Puritan Interregnum when the theatres were closed (1642–1660), the comic subplot of Bottom and his compatriots was performed as a droll. Drolls were comical playlets, often adapted from the subplots of Shakespearean and other plays, that could be attached to the acts of acrobats and jugglers and other allowed performances, thus circumventing the ban against drama. When the theatres re-opened in 1660, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; was acted in adapted form, like many other Shakespearean plays. Samuel Pepys saw it on 29 September 1662 and thought it &quot;the most insipid, ridiculous play that ever I saw ...&quot;

After the Jacobean / Caroline era, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; was never performed in its entirety until the 1840s. Instead, it was heavily adapted in forms like Henry Purcell&#x27;s musical masque/play &quot;The Fairy Queen&quot; (1692), which had a successful run at the Dorset Garden Theatre, but was not revived. Richard Leveridge turned the Pyramus and Thisbe scenes into an Italian opera burlesque, acted at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields in 1716. John Frederick Lampe elaborated upon Leveridge&#x27;s version in 1745. Charles Johnson had used the Pyramus and Thisbe material in the finale of &quot;Love in a Forest&quot;, his 1723 adaptation of &quot;As You Like It&quot;. In 1755, David Garrick did the opposite of what had been done a century earlier: he extracted Bottom and his companions and acted the rest, in an adaptation called &quot;The Fairies.&quot; Frederic Reynolds produced an operatic version in 1816.

===The Victorian stage===
In 1840, Madame Vestris at Covent Garden returned the play to the stage with a relatively full text, adding musical sequences and balletic dances. Vestris took the role of Oberon, and for the next seventy years, Oberon and Puck would always be played by women.

After the success of Madame Vestris&#x27; production, 19th-century theatre continued to stage the &quot;Dream&quot; as a spectacle, often with a cast numbering nearly one hundred. Detailed sets were created for the palace and the forest, and the fairies were portrayed as gossamer-winged ballerinas. The overture by Felix Mendelssohn was always used throughout this period. Augustin Daly&#x27;s production opened in 1895 in London and ran for 21 performances.

===20th and 21st centuries===
In 1905 Oscar Asche staged a production at the Adelphi Theatre in London with himself as Bottom and Beatrice Ferrar as Puck.
Herbert Beerbohm Tree staged a 1911 production which featured &quot;mechanical birds twittering in beech trees, a simulated stream, fairies wearing battery-operated lighting, and live rabbits following trails of food across the stage.&quot;

Max Reinhardt staged &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; thirteen times between 1905 and 1934, introducing a revolving set. After he fled Germany he devised a more spectacular outdoor version at the Hollywood Bowl in September 1934. The shell was removed and replaced by a forest planted in tons of dirt hauled in especially for the event, and a trestle was constructed from the hills to the stage. The wedding procession inserted between Acts IV and V crossed the trestle with torches down the hillside. The cast included James Cagney, Olivia de Havilland, Mickey Rooney, Victor Jory, and a corps of dancers that included Butterfly McQueen. The play was accompanied by Mendelssohn&#x27;s music.

On the strength of this production, Warner Brothers signed Reinhardt to direct a filmed version, Hollywood&#x27;s first Shakespeare movie since Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Mary Pickford&#x27;s &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot; in 1929. Jory (Oberon), Rooney (Puck) and De Havilland (Hermia) reprised their roles from the Hollywood Bowl cast. James Cagney starred, in his only Shakespearean role, as Bottom. Other actors in the film who played Shakespearean roles just this once included Joe E. Brown and Dick Powell. Erich Wolfgang Korngold was brought from Austria to arrange Mendelssohn&#x27;s music for the film. He used not only the &quot;Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; music but also several other pieces by Mendelssohn. Korngold went on to make a legendary career in Hollywood, remaining in the United States after Nazi Germany annexed Austria.

Director Harley Granville-Barker introduced in 1914 a less spectacular way of staging the &quot;Dream&quot;: he reduced the size of the cast and used Elizabethan folk music instead of Mendelssohn. He replaced large, complex sets with a simple system of patterned curtains. He portrayed the fairies as golden robotic insectoid creatures based on Cambodian idols. His simpler, sparer staging significantly influenced subsequent productions.

In 1970, Peter Brook staged the play for the Royal Shakespeare Company in a blank white box, in which masculine fairies engaged in circus tricks such as trapeze artistry. Brook also introduced the subsequently common notion of doubling Theseus/Oberon and Hippolyta/Titania, as if to suggest that the world of the fairies is a mirror version of the world of the mortals. British actors who played roles in Brook&#x27;s production included Patrick Stewart, Ben Kingsley, John Kane (Puck) and Frances de la Tour (Helena). Recordings documenting this production survive.

&quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; has been produced many times in New York, including a production by the Theatre for a New Audience, produced by Joseph Papp at the Public Theater, and also several stagings by the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Delacorte Theatre in Central Park. In 1978, the Riverside Shakespeare Company staged an outdoor production starring Eric Hoffmann as Puck, with Karen Hurley as Titania and Eric Conger as Oberon, directed by company founder Gloria Skurski. There have been several variations since then, including some set in the 1980s.

The Maryland Shakespeare Players at University of Maryland staged a queer production in 2015 in which the lovers were same-sex couples and the mechanicals were drag queens.

The University of Michigan&#x27;s Nichols Arboretum&#x27;s programme Shakespeare in the Arb has presented a play every summer since 2001. Shakespeare in the Arb has produced &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; three times. These performances take place in a natural setting, with lush woods, a flowing river, and steep hills. The performance takes place in several places, with actors and audience moving together to each setting. &quot;As one critic commented, &#x27;The actors used the vastness of its Arb[oretum] stage to full advantage, making entrances from behind trees, appearing over rises and vanishing into the woods.&#x27;&quot;

Artistic director Emma Rice&#x27;s first production at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe in 2016 was a version of the play. While not &quot;a production to please the purists&quot;, it received praise. A contemporary reworking, it included gender-switched characters and Bollywood influences.

==Adaptations and cultural references==
===Plays===
&quot;Absurda Comica, oder Herr Peter Squentz&quot; by Andreas Gryphius, which was probably written between 1648 and 1650 and was published in 1657, is evidently based on the comic episode of Pyramus and Thisbe in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

Ken Ludwig&#x27;s 2003 comic play, &quot;Shakespeare in Hollywood&quot;, is set during the production of the 1935 film. Oberon and Puck appear on the scene, and find themselves cast as themselves.

===Literary===
The play was translated into Esperanto (constructed international auxiliary language) by Louise Briggs in 1920.

W. Stanley Moss used the quotation &quot;Ill met by moonlight&quot; as the title of his &quot;Ill Met by Moonlight&quot; (1950), a non-fiction book about the kidnap of General Kreipe during WWII. The book was adapted into a film with the same name in 1957.

Botho Strauß&#x27;s play &quot;The Park&quot; (1983) is based on characters and motifs from &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

Neil Gaiman&#x27;s comic series &quot;The Sandman&quot; uses the play in the 1990 issue &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. In this story, Shakespeare and his company perform the play for the real Oberon and Titania and an audience of fairies. The play is heavily quoted in the comic, and Shakespeare&#x27;s son Hamnet appears in the play as the Indian boy. This issue was the first and only comic to win the World Fantasy Award for Best Short Fiction, in 1991.

Terry Pratchett&#x27;s book &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot; (1992) is a parody of the play.

Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Fools and Mortals&quot; (2017) is about the creation and first performance of the play, as seen by the young actor, Richard Shakespeare, brother of the playwright.

===Musical versions===
&quot;The Fairy-Queen&quot; is an opera from 1692 by Henry Purcell, based on the play.
In 1826, Felix Mendelssohn composed a concert overture, inspired by the play, that was first performed in 1827. In 1842, partly because of the fame of the overture, and partly because his employer King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia liked the incidental music that Mendelssohn had written for other plays that had been staged at the palace in German translation, Mendelssohn was commissioned to write incidental music for a production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; that was to be staged in 1843 in Potsdam. He incorporated the existing Overture into the incidental music, which was used in most stage versions through the 19th century. The best known of the pieces from the incidental music is the famous &quot;Wedding March&quot;, frequently used as a recessional in weddings.

Between 1917 and 1939 Carl Orff also wrote incidental music for a German version of the play, &quot;Ein Sommernachtstraum&quot; (performed in 1939). Given that Mendelssohn&#x27;s parents had been Jews (and despite the fact that they converted to Lutheranism), his music had been banned by the Nazi regime, and the Nazi cultural officials put out a call for new music for the play: Orff was one of the musicians who responded. He later reworked the music for a final version, completed in 1964.

In 1949, a three-act opera by Marcel Delannoy entitled &quot;Puck&quot; was premiered in Strasbourg.

&quot;Over Hill, Over Dale&quot;, from Act 2, is the third of the &quot;Three Shakespeare Songs&quot; set to music by the British composer Ralph Vaughan Williams. He wrote the pieces for a cappella SATB choir in 1951 for the British Federation of Music Festivals, and they remain a popular part of British choral repertoire today.

The play was adapted into an opera, with music by Benjamin Britten and libretto by Britten and Peter Pears. This was first performed on 11 June 1960 at Aldeburgh.

In 1964, a musical adaptation debuted on Broadway as &quot;Babes in The Wood&quot;.

Progressive rock guitarist Steve Hackett, best known for his work with Genesis, made a classical adaptation of the play in 1997. Hans Werner Henze&#x27;s Eighth Symphony, written in 1993, is also inspired by sequences from the play.

The theatre company Moonwork put on a production of &quot;Midsummer&quot; in 1999. It was conceived by Mason Pettit, Gregory Sherman and Gregory Wolfe (who directed it). The show featured a rock-opera version of the play within a play, Pyramus &amp; Thisbe, with music written by Rusty Magee. The music for the rest of the show was written by Andrew Sherman.

&quot;The Donkey Show&quot; is a disco-era experience based on &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, that first appeared off Broadway in 1999.

In 2011, Opera Memphis, Playhouse on the Square, and contemporary a cappella groups DeltaCappella and Riva, premiered Michael Ching&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream: Opera A Cappella&quot;.

In 2015, the plot of &quot;Be More Chill&quot; included a version of the play called &quot;A Midsummer Nightmare (About Zombies)&quot;.

===Ballets===
* Marius Petipa made a ballet adaptation for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg with additional music and adaptations to Mendelssohn&#x27;s score by Léon Minkus. The revival premiered 14 July 1876. 
* George Balanchine&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, his first original full-length ballet, was premiered by the New York City Ballet on 17 January 1962. It was chosen to open the NYCB&#x27;s first season at the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center in 1964. Balanchine interpolated further music by Mendelssohn into his &quot;Dream&quot;, including the overture from &quot;Athalie&quot;. A film version of the ballet was released in 1966.
* Frederick Ashton created &quot;The Dream&quot;, a short (not full-length) ballet set exclusively to the famous music by Félix Mendelssohn, arranged by John Lanchbery, in 1964. It was created on England&#x27;s Royal Ballet and has since entered the repertoire of other companies, notably The Joffrey Ballet and American Ballet Theatre.
* John Neumeier created his full-length ballet &quot;Ein Sommernachtstraum&quot; for his company at the Hamburg State Opera (Hamburgische Staatsoper) in 1977. Longer than Ashton&#x27;s or Balanchine&#x27;s earlier versions, Neumeier&#x27;s version includes other music by Mendelssohn along with the &quot;Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; music, as well as music from the modern composer György Ligeti, and jaunty barrel organ music. Neumeier devotes the three sharply differing musical styles to the three character groups, with the aristocrats and nobles dancing to Mendelssohn, the fairies to Ligeti, and the rustics or mechanicals to the barrel organ.
* Elvis Costello composed the music for a full-length ballet &quot;Il Sogno&quot;, based on &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. The music was subsequently released as a classical album by Deutsche Grammophon in 2004.

===Film adaptations===

&quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; has been adapted as a film many times. The following are the best known.
* A 1925 German silent film &quot;Wood Love&quot; directed by Hans Neumann.
* A 1935 film version was directed by Max Reinhardt and William Dieterle. The cast included James Cagney as Bottom, Mickey Rooney as Puck, Olivia de Havilland as Hermia, Joe E. Brown as Francis Flute, Dick Powell as Lysander, Anita Louise as Titania and Victor Jory as Oberon.

* &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Sex Comedy&quot; (1982) was written and directed by Woody Allen. The plot is loosely based on Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Smiles of a Summer Night&quot;, with some elements from Shakespeare&#x27;s play.
* &quot;Bottom&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1983) was an animated short directed by John Canemaker, showing events of the play from the point of view of Bottom. The film uses selections of Mendelssohn&#x27;s music, lines from the play, and surreal imagery to convey Bottom&#x27;s experience.
* &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; features the play as a production for which Neil Perry tries out and wins the role of Puck, in spite of his father&#x27;s disapproval of his acting aspirations.
* A 1996 adaptation directed by Adrian Noble. The cast included Desmond Barrit as Bottom, Finbar Lynch as Puck, Alex Jennings as Oberon/Theseus, and Lindsay Duncan as Titania/Hippolyta. This film is based on Noble&#x27;s Royal Shakespeare Company production. Its art design is eccentric, featuring a forest of floating light bulbs and a giant umbrella for Titania&#x27;s bower.
* A 1996 French film, &quot;The Apartment&quot; (), directed by Gilles Mimouni, has many references to the play.
* A 1999 film version was written and directed by Michael Hoffman. The cast includes Kevin Kline as Bottom, Rupert Everett as Oberon, Michelle Pfeiffer as Titania, Stanley Tucci as Puck, Sophie Marceau as Hippolyta, Christian Bale as Demetrius, Dominic West as Lysander, Anna Friel as Hermia and Calista Flockhart as Helena. This adaptation relocates the play&#x27;s action from Athens to a fictional &quot;Monte Athena&quot;, located in Tuscany, Italy, although all textual mentions of Athens are retained.
* A 1999 version was written and directed by James Kerwin. The cast included Travis Schuldt as Demetrius. It set the story against a surreal backdrop of techno clubs and ancient symbols.
* &quot;The Children&#x27;s Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (2002), directed by Christine Edzard, was produced by Sands Films at their studio in Rotherhithe, London, using 350 school children from Southwark, between the ages of eight and eleven, all theatrically untrained. The sets and costumes were designed to scale and made on site.
* &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Rave&quot; (2002) directed by Gil Cates Jr. changes the setting to a modern rave. Puck is a drug dealer, the magic flower called love-in-idleness is replaced with magic ecstasy, and the King and Queen of Fairies are the host of the rave and the DJ.
* &quot;Were the World Mine&quot; (2008) features a modern interpretation of the play put on in a private high school in a small town.
* &quot;10ml Love&quot; (2012) by Sharat Katariya reimagines the play in modern-day India.
* &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, an American independent film that relocates the story to modern-day Los Angeles.
* &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, a UK production shot in Austria, set in an alternative near future. Directed by Sacha Bennett, it features Robert Lindsay as Oberon, Juliet Aubrey as Titania, Lee Boardman as Bottom, Harry Jarvis as Lysander, Tamzin Merchant as Helena, Holly Earl as Hermia, Tyger Drew-Honey as Demetrius and Florence Kasumba as Hippolyta.

===TV productions===
* The &quot;play within a play&quot; from Act V, Scene I, &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot;, was performed by members of The Beatles on 28 April 1964 for a British television special, &quot;Around The Beatles&quot;. Paul McCartney appeared as Pyramus, John Lennon as Thisbe, George Harrison as Moonshine, and Ringo Starr as Lion. The performance, before a live audience, was done with great comic intent and included a number of intentional hecklers. This was broadcast in the UK on ITV on 6 May, and in the US on ABC on 15 November.
* The 1981 BBC Television Shakespeare production was produced by Jonathan Miller and directed by Elijah Moshinsky. It starred Helen Mirren as Titania, Peter McEnery as Oberon, Phil Daniels as Puck, Robert Lindsay as Lysander, Geoffrey Palmer as Quince and Brian Glover as Bottom.
* An abbreviated version of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; was made into an animated short (with the same title) by Walt Disney Television Animation in 1999 as part of the &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; series. It was featured in a 2002 episode of &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (&quot;House of Scrooge&quot;, Season 3, Episode 34). The star-crossed lovers are played by Mickey Mouse (Lysander), Minnie Mouse (Hermia), Donald Duck (Demetrius), and Daisy Duck (Helena). The character based on Theseus is played by Ludwig Von Drake, and the character based on Egeus by Scrooge McDuck. Goofy appears as an accident-prone Puck. The story ends with the revelation that it was a dream experienced by Mickey Mouse while sleeping at a picnic hosted by Minnie.
* In 2005 &quot;ShakespeaRe-Told&quot;, the BBC TV series, aired an updated of the play. It was written by Peter Bowker. The cast includes Johnny Vegas as Bottom, Dean Lennox Kelly as Puck, Bill Paterson as Theo (a conflation of Theseus and Egeus), and Imelda Staunton as his wife Polly (Hippolyta). Lennie James plays Oberon and Sharon Small is Titania. Zoe Tapper and Michelle Bonnard play Hermia and Helena.
* In 2006, &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot; released an episode called &quot;A Midsummer&#x27;s Nightmare&quot; where the children are preparing to perform Shakespeare&#x27;s popular work for a school play. This episode was #22 in season two of the show.
* BBC One&#x27;s 2016 production was a 90-minute TV film adaptation by Russell T Davies directed by David Kerr starring Matt Lucas as Bottom, Maxine Peake as Titania, and with a diverse cast including Nonso Anozie as Oberon, Prisca Bakare as Hermia and Hiran Abeysekera as Puck.

===Astronomy===
In 1787, British astronomer William Herschel discovered two new moons of Uranus. In 1852 his son John Herschel named them after characters in the play: Oberon, and Titania. Another Uranian moon, discovered in 1985 by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft, has been named Puck.

<text>Polychaeta () is a paraphyletic class of generally marine annelid worms, commonly called bristle worms or polychaetes (). Each body segment has a pair of fleshy protrusions called parapodia that bear many bristles, called chaetae, which are made of chitin. More than 10,000 species are described in this class. Common representatives include the lugworm (&quot;Arenicola marina&quot;) and the sandworm or clam worm &quot;Alitta&quot;.

Polychaetes as a class are robust and widespread, with species that live in the coldest ocean temperatures of the abyssal plain, to forms which tolerate the extremely high temperatures near hydrothermal vents. Polychaetes occur throughout the Earth&#x27;s oceans at all depths, from forms that live as plankton near the surface, to a 2- to 3-cm specimen (still unclassified) observed by the robot ocean probe &quot;Nereus&quot; at the bottom of the Challenger Deep, the deepest known spot in the Earth&#x27;s oceans. Only 168 species (less than 2% of all polychaetes) are known from fresh waters.

==Description==
Polychaetes are segmented worms, generally less than in length, although ranging at the extremes from to , in &quot;Eunice aphroditois&quot;. They can sometimes be brightly coloured, and may be iridescent or even luminescent. Each segment bears a pair of paddle-like and highly vascularized parapodia, which are used for movement and, in many species, act as the worm&#x27;s primary respiratory surfaces. Bundles of bristles, called chaetae, project from the parapodia.

However, polychaetes vary widely from this generalized pattern, and can display a range of different body forms. The most generalised polychaetes are those that crawl along the bottom, but others have adapted to many different ecological niches, including burrowing, swimming, pelagic life, tube-dwelling or boring, commensalism, and parasitism, requiring various modifications to their body structures.

The head, or prostomium, is relatively well developed, compared with other annelids. It projects forward over the mouth, which therefore lies on the animal&#x27;s underside. The head normally includes two to four pair of eyes, although some species are blind. These are typically fairly simple structures, capable of distinguishing only light and dark, although some species have large eyes with lenses that may be capable of more sophisticated vision, including the Alciopids&#x27; complex eyes which rival cephalopod and vertebrate eyes.

Many species show bioluminescence; eight families have luminous species.

The head also includes a pair of antennae, tentacle-like palps, and a pair of pits lined with cilia, known as &quot;nuchal organs&quot;. These latter appear to be chemoreceptors, and help the worm to seek out food.

===Internal anatomy and physiology===

The outer surface of the body wall consists of a simple columnar epithelium covered by a thin cuticle. Underneath this, in order, are a thin layer of connective tissue, a layer of circular muscle, a layer of longitudinal muscle, and a peritoneum surrounding the body cavity. Additional oblique muscles move the parapodia. In most species the body cavity is divided into separate compartments by sheets of peritoneum between each segment, but in some species it is more continuous.

The mouth of polychaetes is located on the peristomium, the segment behind the prostomium, and varies in form depending on their diets, since the group includes predators, herbivores, filter feeders, scavengers, and parasites. In general, however, they possess a pair of jaws and a pharynx that can be rapidly everted, allowing the worms to grab food and pull it into their mouths. In some species, the pharynx is modified into a lengthy proboscis. The digestive tract is a simple tube, usually with a stomach part way along.

The smallest species, and those adapted to burrowing, lack gills, breathing only through their body surfaces. Most other species have external gills, often associated with the parapodia.

A simple but well-developed circulatory system is usually present. The two main blood vessels furnish smaller vessels to supply the parapodia and the gut. Blood flows forward in the dorsal vessel, above the gut, and returns down the body in the ventral vessel, beneath the gut. The blood vessels themselves are contractile, helping to push the blood along, so most species have no need of a heart. In a few cases, however, muscular pumps analogous to a heart are found in various parts of the system. Conversely, some species have little or no circulatory system at all, transporting oxygen in the coelomic fluid that fills their body cavities.

The blood may be colourless, or have any of three different respiratory pigments. The most common of these is haemoglobin, but some groups have haemerythrin or the green-coloured chlorocruorin, instead.

The nervous system consists of a single or double ventral nerve cord running the length of the body, with ganglia and a series of small nerves in each segment. The brain is relatively large, compared with that of other annelids, and lies in the upper part of the head. An endocrine gland is attached to the ventral posterior surface of the brain, and appears to be involved in reproductive activity. In addition to the sensory organs on the head, photosensitive eye spots, statocysts, and numerous additional sensory nerve endings, most likely involved with the sense of touch, also occur on the body.

Polychaetes have a varying number of protonephridia or metanephridia for excreting waste, which in some cases can be relatively complex in structure. The body also contains greenish &quot;chloragogen&quot; tissue, similar to that found in oligochaetes, which appears to function in metabolism, in a similar fashion to that of the vertebrate liver.

The cuticle is constructed from cross-linked fibres of collagen and may be 200 nm to 13 mm thick. Their jaws are formed from sclerotised collagen, and their setae from sclerotised chitin.

==Ecology==

Polychaetes are predominantly marine, but many species also live in freshwater, and a few in terrestrial environments. They are extremely variable in both form and lifestyle, and include a few taxa that swim among the plankton or above the abyssal plain. Most burrow or build tubes in the sediment, and some live as commensals. A few species, roughly 80 (less than 0.5% of species), are parasitic. These include both ectoparasites and endoparasites. Ectoparasitic polychaetes feed on skin, blood, and other secretions, and some are adapted to bore through hard, usually calcerous surfaces, such as the shells of mollusks. These &quot;boring&quot; polychaetes may be parasitic, but may be opportunistic or even obligate symbionts (commensals).

The mobile forms (Errantia) tend to have well-developed sense organs and jaws, while the stationary forms (Sedentaria) lack them, but may have specialized gills or tentacles used for respiration and deposit or filter feeding, e.g., fanworms.
Underwater polychaetes have eversible mouthparts used to capture prey. A few groups have evolved to live in terrestrial environments, like Namanereidinae with many terrestrial species, but are restricted to humid areas. Some have even evolved cutaneous invaginations for aerial gas exchange.

== Notable polychaetes ==
*One notable polychaete, the Pompeii worm (&quot;Alvinella pompejana&quot;), is endemic to the hydrothermal vents of the Pacific Ocean. Pompeii worms are among the most heat-tolerant complex animals known.
*A recently discovered genus, &quot;Osedax&quot;, includes a species nicknamed the &quot;bone-eating snot flower&quot;.
*Another remarkable polychaete is &quot;Hesiocaeca methanicola&quot;, which lives on methane clathrate deposits.
*&quot;Lamellibrachia luymesi&quot; is a cold seep tube worm that reaches lengths of over 3 m and may be the most long-lived annelid, being over 250 years old. 
*A still unclassified multilegged predatory polychaete worm was identified only by observation from the underwater vehicle &quot;Nereus&quot; at the bottom of the Challenger Deep, the greatest depth in the oceans, near in depth. It was about an inch long visually, but the probe failed to capture it, so it could not be studied in detail.
*The Bobbit worm (&quot;Eunice aphroditois&quot;) is a predatory species that can achieve a length of ), with an average diameter of .
*&quot;Dimorphilus gyrociliatus&quot; has the smallest known genome of any annelid. The species shows extreme sexual dimorphism. Females measure ~1 mm long and have simplified bodies containing six segments, a reduced coelom, and no appendages, parapodia, or chaetae. The males are only 50 μm long and consist of just a few hundred cells. They lack a digestive system and have just 68 neurons, and only live for roughly a week.

==Reproduction==
Most polychaetes have separate sexes, rather than being hermaphroditic. The most primitive species have a pair of gonads in every segment, but most species exhibit some degree of specialisation. The gonads shed immature gametes directly into the body cavity, where they complete their development. Once mature, the gametes are shed into the surrounding water through ducts or openings that vary between species, or in some cases by the complete rupture of the body wall (and subsequent death of the adult). A few species copulate, but most fertilize their eggs externally.

The fertilized eggs typically hatch into trochophore larvae, which float among the plankton, and eventually metamorphose into the adult form by adding segments. A few species have no larval form, with the egg hatching into a form resembling the adult, and in many that do have larvae, the trochophore never feeds, surviving off the yolk that remains from the egg.

However, some polychaetes exhibit remarkable reproductive strategies. Some species reproduce by epitoky. For much of the year, these worms look like any other burrow-dwelling polychaete, but as the breeding season approaches, the worm undergoes a remarkable transformation as new, specialized segments begin to grow from its rear end until the worm can be clearly divided into two halves. The front half, the atoke, is asexual. The new rear half, responsible for breeding, is known as the epitoke. Each of the epitoke segments is packed with eggs and sperm and features a single eyespot on its surface. The beginning of the last lunar quarter is the cue for these animals to breed, and the epitokes break free from the atokes and float to the surface. The eye spots sense when the epitoke reaches the surface and the segments from millions of worms burst, releasing their eggs and sperm into the water.

A similar strategy is employed by the deep sea worm &quot;Syllis ramosa&quot;, which lives inside a sponge. The rear ends of the worm develop into &quot;stolons&quot; containing the eggs or sperm; these stolons then become detached from the parent worm and rise to the sea surface, where fertilisation takes place.

==Fossil record==
Stem-group polychaete fossils are known from the Sirius Passet Lagerstätte, a rich, sedimentary deposit in Greenland tentatively dated to the late Atdabanian (early Cambrian). The oldest found is &quot;Phragmochaeta canicularis&quot;. Many of the more famous Burgess Shale organisms, such as &quot;Canadia&quot;, may also have polychaete affinities. &quot;Wiwaxia&quot;, long interpreted as an annelid, is now considered to represent a mollusc. An even older fossil, &quot;Cloudina&quot;, dates to the terminal Ediacaran period; this has been interpreted as an early polychaete, although consensus is absent.

Being soft-bodied organisms, the fossil record of polychaetes is dominated by their fossilized jaws, known as scolecodonts, and the mineralized tubes that some of them secrete. Most important biomineralising polychaetes are serpulids, sabellids, and cirratulids. Polychaete cuticle does have some preservation potential; it tends to survive for at least 30 days after a polychaete&#x27;s death. Although biomineralisation is usually necessary to preserve soft tissue after this time, the presence of polychaete muscle in the nonmineralised Burgess shale shows this need not always be the case. Their preservation potential is similar to that of jellyfish.

==Taxonomy and systematics==



Taxonomically, polychaetes are thought to be paraphyletic, meaning the group excludes some descendants of its most recent common ancestor. Groups that may be descended from the polychaetes include the clitellates (earthworms and leeches), sipunculans, and echiurans. The Pogonophora and Vestimentifera were once considered separate phyla, but are now classified in the polychaete family Siboglinidae.

Much of the classification below matches Rouse &amp; Fauchald, 1998, although that paper does not apply ranks above family.

Older classifications recognize many more (sub)orders than the layout presented here. As comparatively few polychaete taxa have been subject to cladistic analysis, some groups which are usually considered invalid today may eventually be reinstated.

These divisions were shown to be mostly paraphyletic in recent years.

<text>Priapulida (priapulid worms, from Gr. πριάπος, &quot;priāpos&quot; &#x27;Priapus&#x27; + Lat. &quot;-ul-&quot;, diminutive), sometimes referred to as penis worms, is a phylum of unsegmented marine worms. The name of the phylum relates to the Greek god of fertility, because their general shape and their extensible spiny introvert (eversible) proboscis may resemble the shape of a human penis. They live in the mud, except for a few tropical meiobenthic species which lives in medium- to coarse-grained sands, and in comparatively shallow waters up to deep and no warmer than 12–13°C. Some species show a remarkable tolerance for hydrogen sulfide, anoxia and low salinity. &quot;Halicryptus spinulosus&quot; appears to prefer brackish shallow waters. They can be quite abundant in some areas. In an Alaskan bay as many as 85 adult individuals of &quot;Priapulus caudatus&quot; per square meter has been recorded, while the density of its larvae can be as high as 58,000 per square meter (5,390 per square foot).

Together with Echiura and Sipuncula, they were once placed in the taxon Gephyrea, but consistent morphological and molecular evidence supports their belonging to Ecdysozoa, which also includes arthropods and nematodes. Fossil findings show that the mouth design of the stem-arthropod &quot;Pambdelurion&quot; is identical with that of priapulids, indicating that their mouth is an original trait inherited from the last common ancestor of both priapulids and arthropods, even if modern arthropods no longer possess it. Among Ecdysozoa, their nearest relatives are Kinorhyncha and Loricifera, with which they constitute the Scalidophora clade named after the spines covering the introvert (scalids). They feed on slow-moving invertebrates, such as polychaete worms.

Some analyses suggest that Priapulida may represent a basal lineage within Ecdysozoa, leading to their classification as &quot;living fossils&quot;. Priapulid-like fossils are known at least as far back as the Middle Cambrian. They were likely major predators of the Cambrian period. However, crown-group priapulids cannot be recognized until the Carboniferous. 22 extant species of priapulid worms are known, half of them being of meiobenthic size.

== Anatomy ==
Priapulids are cylindrical worm-like animals, ranging from 0.2 to 0.3 to 39 centimetres (0.08–0.12 to 15.35 in) long, with a median anterior mouth quite devoid of any armature or tentacles. The body is divided into a main trunk or abdomen and a somewhat swollen proboscis region ornamented with longitudinal ridges. The body is ringed and often has circles of spines, which are continued into the slightly protrusible pharynx. Family Priapulidae have species with a tail or a pair of caudal appendages. A slender tail or tail filament is also found in family Tubiluchidae. Appendages are absent in the remaining families. The body has a chitinous cuticle that is moulted as the animal grows. Members of the family Chaetostephanidae also secretes a gelatinous tube, open in both ends, which they live in.

There is a wide body-cavity, which has no connection with the renal or reproductive organs, so it is not a coelom; it is probably a blood-space or hemocoel. There are no vascular or respiratory systems, but the body cavity does contain phagocytic amoebocytes and cells containing the respiratory pigment haemerythrin.

The alimentary canal is straight, consisting of an eversible pharynx, an intestine, and a short rectum. The pharynx is muscular and lined by teeth. Three of the five extant families have gone through a significant miniaturization and become detritivores (Tubiluchidae and Meiopriapulidae) and filter feeders (Chaetostephanidae). The two remaining families Priapulidae and Halicryptidae are larger carnivores that feed on other animals, although some species also consume detritus as larvae. The shape of the teeth reflect these different lifestyles, and seem to be adapted mainly towards grasping prey or raking detritus from the sediment into the mouth. The anus is terminal, although in &quot;Priapulus&quot; one or two hollow ventral diverticula of the body-wall stretch out behind it.

The nervous system consists of a nerve ring around the pharynx and a prominent cord running the length of the body with ganglia and longitudinal and transversal neurites consistent with an orthogonal organisation. The nervous system retains a basiepidermal configuration with a connection with the ectoderm, forming part of the body wall. There are no specialized sense organs, but there are sensory nerve endings in the body, especially on the proboscis.

The priapulids are gonochoristic, having two separate sexes (i.e. male and female). Their male and female organs are closely associated with the excretory protonephridia. They comprise a pair of branching tufts, each of which opens to the exterior on one side of the anus. The tips of these tufts enclose a flame-cell like those found in flatworms and other animals, and these probably function as excretory organs. As the animals mature, diverticula arise on the tubes of these organs, which develop either spermatozoa or ova. These sex cells pass out through the ducts. The perigenital area of the genus Tubiluchus exhibit sexual dimorphism.

=== Reproduction and development ===
For the species &quot;Priapulus caudatus&quot;, the 80 μm egg undergoes a total and radial cleavage following a symmetrical and subequal pattern. Development is remarkably slow, with the first cleavage taking place 15 hours after fertilization, gastrulation after several days and hatching of the first &#x27;lorica&#x27; larvae after 15 to 20 days. The species &quot;Meiopriapulus fijiensis&quot; have direct development. In current systematics, they are described as protostomes, despite having a deuterostomic development. Because the group is so ancient, it is assumed the deuterostome condition which appears to be ancestral for bilaterians have been maintained.

== Fossil record ==

Stem-group priapulids are known from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale, where their soft-part anatomy is preserved, often in conjunction with their gut contents – allowing a reconstruction of their diets. In addition, isolated microfossils (corresponding to the various teeth and spines that line the pharynx and introvert) are widespread in Cambrian deposits, allowing the distribution of priapulids – and even individual species – to be tracked widely through Cambrian oceans. Trace fossils that are morphologically almost identical to modern priapulid burrows (&quot;Treptichnus pedum&quot;) officially mark the start of the Cambrian period, suggesting that priapulids, or at least close anatomical relatives, evolved around this time. Crown-group priapulid body fossils are first known from the Carboniferous.

<text>Vetulicolia is a group of bilaterian marine animals encompassing several extinct species from the Cambrian, and possibly Ediacaran, periods. As of 2023, the majority of workers favor placing Vetulicolians in the stem group of the Chordata, but some continue to favor a more crownward placement as a sister group to the Tunicata. It was initially erected as a monophyletic clade with the rank of phylum in 2001, with subsequent work supporting its monophyly. However, more recent research suggests that vetulicolians may be paraphyletic and form a basal evolutionary grade of stem chordates.

==Etymology==
The taxon name, Vetulicolia, is derived from the type genus, &quot;Vetulicola&quot;, which is a compound Latin word composed of &quot;vetuli&quot; &quot;old&quot; and &quot;cola&quot; &quot;inhabitant&quot;. It was named after &quot;Vetulicola cuneata&quot;, the first species of the group described in 1987.

==Description==
The vetulicolian body plan comprises two parts: a voluminous rostral (anterior) forebody, tipped with an anteriorly positioned mouth and lined with a lateral row of five round to oval-shaped openings on each side, which have been interpreted as gills (or at least orifices in the vicinity of the pharynx); and a caudal (posterior) section that primitively comprises seven body segments and functions as a tail. All vetulicolians lack preserved appendages of any kind, having no legs, feelers or even eye spots. The area where the anterior and posterior parts join is constricted in most genera. Notochord-like structures have been found in some vetulicolian fossils.

== Ecology and lifestyle ==
From their superficially tadpole-like forms, leaf or paddle-shaped tails, and various degrees of streamlining, it is assumed that all vetulicolians discovered to date were swimming animals that spent much, if not all, of their time living in water. Some groups, like the genus &quot;Vetulicola&quot;, were more streamlined (complete with ventral keels) than other groups, such as the tadpole-like Didazoonidae.

Because all vetulicolians had mouths which had no features for chewing or grasping, it is assumed that they were not predators. Since vetulicolians possessed gill slits, many researchers regard these organisms as planktivores. The sediment infills in the guts of their fossils have caused some to suggest that they were deposit feeders. This idea has been contested, as deposit feeders tend to have straight guts, whereas the hindguts of vetulicolians were spiral-shaped. Some researchers propose that the vetulicolians were &quot;selective deposit-feeders&quot; which actively swam from one region of the seafloor to another, while supplementing their nutrition with filter-feeding.

The earliest vetulicolians appear to have lived in shallow water, with the first deeper water specimens appearing in the Balang Biota and possibly in the Qingjiang Biota.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The phylum Vetulicolia was erected in 2001 to group the genera &quot;Vetulicola&quot;, &quot;Didazoon&quot;, and &quot;Xidazoon&quot; (later deemed a junior synonym of &quot;Pomatrum&quot;). Prior to this the class Vetulicolida had been defined in 1997 to group &quot;Vetulicola&quot; with the previously enigmatic genus &quot;Banffia&quot; due to its similar two-part construction, as well as apparent gill slits in a newly discovered specimen. Further work split &quot;Banffia&quot; into a separate class called Banffozoa, which was soon expanded to encompass similar species such as &quot;Heteromorphus&quot;.
While subsequent studies supported the monophyly of Vetulicolia, it has also been noted that this would preclude vetulicolians representing a stepwise development of deuterostome characteristics, as the genus with the most such characteristics, &quot;Vetulicola&quot;, is one of the most derived in the group.

A 2024 phylogenetic analysis by Mussini and colleagues found vetulicolians to be a paraphyletic group of stem-chordates, lying outside a clade formed by &quot;Yunnanozoon&quot;, &quot;Cathaymyrus&quot;, &quot;Pikaia&quot; and crown-chordates. This is in part due to the Cambroernida, which are basal stem-ambulacrarians, being discovered to share characteristics such as a terminal anus with vetulicolians, despite such characteristics previously being believed to be present in the last common ancestor of deuterostomes. However, ascidian larvae have been noted to have endoderm extending to the terminal end, which could suggest that the ancestral tunicate also had a terminal anus.

Other possible placements are suggested by the Centroneuralia hypothesis, which features a paraphyletic Deuterostomia with chordates as the sister-group to protostomes. If proven true, pharyngeal slits would no longer require a deuterostome placement and vetulicolians could prove to be stem protostomes that lost the post-anal tail. In such a scenario, Banffozoa could be a more derived stem protostome group than Vetulicolida.

===Cladograms===
The following cladograms show two possible placements of the Vetulicolia.

First, on the left, a monophyletic Vetulicolia is shown as the sister group to Tunicata, but with all internal relationships unresolved.

Next, on the right, the two proposed classes are shown as the earlier (Banffozoa) and later (Vetulicolida) parts of the vetulicolian grade. Within the Vetulicolida, the family Vetulicolidae as defined by Li &quot;et al.&quot; (2018) is recovered as monophyletic, while the three widely accepted members of the Didazoonidae are in a polytomy with the clade of crownward chordates.

===History of identification===

The current consensus view is that vetulicolians are stem group chordates, although some researchers continue to raise other possibilities. The possible identification of an endostyle bolstered theories of a tunicate affinity, but was later retracted, while the tentative identification of a notochord in &quot;Nesonektris&quot; and &quot;Vetulicola&quot; has further supported overall chordate affinities. Other characters that have been used to support a tunicate affinity include the limiting of the notochord to the tail and the presence of a stiff cuticle (tunic).

Recent research has strengthened the arguments for placing vetulicolians in the chordate stem lineage rather than near the tunicates. Like vetulicolians, members of the basal ambulacrarian clade Cambroernida have a terminal anus rather than a post-anal tail. Since Ambulacraria is the sister-group of the chordates within the deuterostomes, this suggests that the last common ancestor of both groups lacked a post-anal tail. However, ascidian larvae have been noted to have endoderm extending to the terminal end, which could suggest that tunicates also lacked post-anal tails ancestrally.

Some workers have questioned the inclusion of Banffozoa within this group due to their lack of gill slits and apparent gut diverticula, and have theorized that they may fit within Protostomia instead. &quot;Skeemella&quot;, in particular, has been noted as having striking arthropod-like characteristics. However, &quot;Herpetogaster&quot;, the most basal cambroernid, is thought to have non-serialized pores for pharyngial openings. If banffozoans are the most basal vetulicolians, This could explain why they also lack serialized pharyngeal structures. Additionally, a comprehensive review of the Vetulicolia in 2007 did not find evidence of gut diverticula in their material while acknowledging the previous report regarding &quot;Banffia&quot;. &quot;Shenzianyuloma&quot; has been interpreted as a vetulicolian with both a notochord (a definitively deuterostome trait) and gut diverticula. However, this fossil has is of unusual provenance (a &quot;crystal and fossil vendor&quot;), and has not yet been examined by other researchers.

Vetulicolians were thought to be stem arthropods when &quot;Vetulicola&quot; was first discovered, but around 2001 the focus of most theories shifted towards stem deuterostomes due to the discovery of pharyngial gill slits (a deuterostome characteristic), as well as the mounting evidence that vetuicolians have no appendages of any kind. A theory grouping both vetulicolians and vetulocystids with &quot;Saccorhytus&quot; was disproven when the alleged pharyngial openings of &quot;Saccorhytus&quot; were shown to be remnants of spines that had broken off; the saccorhytids are now considered to be ecdysozoans.

<text>Zipf&#x27;s law (; ) is an empirical law stating that when a list of measured values is sorted in decreasing order, the value of the -th entry is often approximately inversely proportional to .

The best known instance of Zipf&#x27;s law applies to the frequency table of words in a text or corpus of natural language:

formula_1

It is usually found that the most common word occurs approximately twice as often as the next common one, three times as often as the third most common, and so on. For example, in the Brown Corpus of American English text, the word &quot;&quot;the&quot; is the most frequently occurring word, and by itself accounts for nearly 7% of all word occurrences (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf&#x27;s law, the second-place word &quot;of&quot; accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by &quot;and&quot;&quot; (28,852). It is often used in the following form, called Zipf-Mandelbrot law:

formula_2 where formula_3 and formula_4 are fitted parameters, with formula_5, and formula_6.

This law is named after the American linguist George Kingsley Zipf, and is still an important concept in quantitative linguistics. It has been found to apply to many other types of data studied in the physical and social sciences.

In mathematical statistics, the concept has been formalized as the Zipfian distribution: A family of related discrete probability distributions whose rank-frequency distribution is an inverse power law relation. They are related to Benford&#x27;s law and the Pareto distribution.

Some sets of time-dependent empirical data deviate somewhat from Zipf&#x27;s law. Such empirical distributions are said to be quasi-Zipfian.

==History==
In 1913, the German physicist Felix Auerbach observed an inverse proportionality between the population sizes of cities, and their ranks when sorted by decreasing order of that variable.

Zipf&#x27;s law had been discovered before Zipf, first by the French stenographer Jean-Baptiste Estoup in 1916, and also by G. Dewey in 1923, and by E. Condon in 1928.

The same relation for frequencies of words in natural language texts was observed by George Zipf in 1932, but he never claimed to have originated it. In fact, Zipf did not like mathematics. In his 1932 publication, the author speaks with disdain about mathematical involvement in linguistics, &quot;a.o. ibidem&quot;, p. 21:
: &quot;... let me say here for the sake of any mathematician who may plan to formulate the ensuing data more exactly, the ability of the highly intense positive to become the highly intense negative, in my opinion, introduces the devil into the formula in the form of&quot; formula_7
The only mathematical expression Zipf used looks like which he &quot;borrowed&quot; from Alfred J. Lotka&#x27;s 1926 publication.

The same relationship was found to occur in many other contexts, and for other variables besides frequency. For example, when corporations are ranked by decreasing size, their sizes are found to be inversely proportional to the rank. The same relation is found for personal incomes (where it is called Pareto principle), number of people watching the same TV channel, notes in music, cells transcriptomes, and more.

In 1992 bioinformatician Wentian Li published a short paper showing that Zipf&#x27;s law emerges even in randomly generated texts. It included proof that the power law form of Zipf&#x27;s law was a byproduct of ordering words by rank.

==Formal definition==
&lt;/math&gt; where &quot;HN,s&quot; is the &quot;N&quot;th generalized harmonic number
| cdf = formula_8
| mean = formula_9
| median = 
| mode = formula_10
| variance = formula_11
| skewness = 
| kurtosis = 
| entropy = formula_12
| mgf = formula_13
| char = formula_14

Formally, the Zipf distribution on elements assigns to the element of rank (counting from 1) the probability:

formula_15 where is a normalization constant: The th harmonic number:

formula_16

The distribution is sometimes generalized to an inverse power law with exponent instead of Namely,

formula_17

where , is a generalized harmonic number

formula_18

The generalized Zipf distribution can be extended to infinitely many items ( = ∞) only if the exponent exceeds In that case, the normalization constant , becomes Riemann&#x27;s zeta function,

formula_19

The infinite item case is characterized by the Zeta distribution and is called Lotka&#x27;s law. If the exponent is or less, the normalization constant , diverges as tends to infinity.

==Empirical testing==

Empirically, a data set can be tested to see whether Zipf&#x27;s law applies by checking the goodness of fit of an empirical distribution to the hypothesized power law distribution with a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, and then comparing the (log) likelihood ratio of the power law distribution to alternative distributions like an exponential distribution or lognormal distribution.

Zipf&#x27;s law can be visuallized by plotting the item frequency data on a log-log graph, with the axes being the logarithm of rank order, and logarithm of frequency. The data conform to Zipf&#x27;s law with exponent to the extent that the plot approximates a linear (more precisely, affine) function with slope . For exponent one can also plot the reciprocal of the frequency (mean interword interval) against rank, or the reciprocal of rank against frequency, and compare the result with the line through the origin with slope 

==Statistical explanations==
Although Zipf&#x27;s Law holds for most natural languages, and even certain artificial ones such as Esperanto and Toki Pona, the reason is still not well understood. Recent reviews of generative processes for Zipf&#x27;s law include Mitzenmacher, &quot;A Brief History of Generative Models for Power Law and Lognormal Distributions&quot;, and Simkin, &quot;Re-inventing Willis&quot;.

However, it may be partly explained by statistical analysis of randomly generated texts. Wentian Li has shown that in a document in which each character has been chosen randomly from a uniform distribution of all letters (plus a space character), the &quot;words&quot; with different lengths follow the macro-trend of Zipf&#x27;s law (the more probable words are the shortest and have equal probability). In 1959, Vitold Belevitch observed that if any of a large class of well-behaved statistical distributions (not only the normal distribution) is expressed in terms of rank and expanded into a Taylor series, the first-order truncation of the series results in Zipf&#x27;s law. Further, a second-order truncation of the Taylor series resulted in Mandelbrot&#x27;s law.

The principle of least effort is another possible explanation:
Zipf himself proposed that neither speakers nor hearers using a given language wants to work any harder than necessary to reach understanding, and the process that results in approximately equal distribution of effort leads to the observed Zipf distribution.

A minimal explanation assumes that words are generated by monkeys typing randomly. If language is generated by a single monkey typing randomly, with fixed and nonzero probability of hitting each letter key or white space, then the words (letter strings separated by white spaces) produced by the monkey follows Zipf&#x27;s law.

Another possible cause for the Zipf distribution is a preferential attachment process, in which the value of an item tends to grow at a rate proportional to (intuitively, &quot;the rich get richer&quot; or &quot;success breeds success&quot;). Such a growth process results in the Yule–Simon distribution, which has been shown to fit word frequency versus rank in language and population versus city rank better than Zipf&#x27;s law. It was originally derived to explain population versus rank in species by Yule, and applied to cities by Simon.

A similar explanation is based on atlas models, systems of exchangeable positive-valued diffusion processes with drift and variance parameters that depend only on the rank of the process. It has been shown mathematically that Zipf&#x27;s law holds for Atlas models that satisfy certain natural regularity conditions.

==Related laws==
A generalization of Zipf&#x27;s law is the Zipf–Mandelbrot law, proposed by Benoit Mandelbrot, whose frequencies are:

formula_20

The constant is the Hurwitz zeta function evaluated at .

Zipfian distributions can be obtained from Pareto distributions by an exchange of variables.

The Zipf distribution is sometimes called the discrete Pareto distribution because it is analogous to the continuous Pareto distribution in the same way that the discrete uniform distribution is analogous to the continuous uniform distribution.

The tail frequencies of the Yule–Simon distribution are approximately

formula_21 for any choice of 

In the parabolic fractal distribution, the logarithm of the frequency is a quadratic polynomial of the logarithm of the rank. This can markedly improve the fit over a simple power-law relationship. Like fractal dimension, it is possible to calculate Zipf dimension, which is a useful parameter in the analysis of texts.

It has been argued that Benford&#x27;s law is a special bounded case of Zipf&#x27;s law, with the connection between these two laws being explained by their both originating from scale invariant functional relations from statistical physics and critical phenomena. The ratios of probabilities in Benford&#x27;s law are not constant. The leading digits of data satisfying Zipf&#x27;s law with satisfy Benford&#x27;s law.
==Occurrences==

===City sizes===

Following Auerbach&#x27;s 1913 observation, there has been substantial examination of Zipf&#x27;s law for city sizes. However, more recent empirical and theoretical studies have challenged the relevance of Zipf&#x27;s law for cities.

===Word frequencies in natural languages===
In many texts in human languages, word frequencies approximately follow a Zipf distribution with exponent close to 1; that is, the most common word occurs about times the -th most common one.

The actual rank-frequency plot of a natural language text deviates in some extent from the ideal Zipf distribution, especially at the two ends of the range. The deviations may depend on the language, on the topic of the text, on the author, on whether the text was translated from another language, and on the spelling rules used. Some deviation is inevitable because of sampling error.

At the low-frequency end, where the rank approaches , the plot takes a staircase shape, because each word can occur only an integer number of times.


In some Romance languages, the frequencies of the dozen or so most frequent words deviate significantly from the ideal Zipf distribution, because of those words include articles inflected for grammatical gender and number.

In many East Asian languages, such as Chinese, Tibetan, and Vietnamese, each morpheme (word or word piece) consists of a single syllable; a word of English being often translated to a compound of two such syllables. The rank-frequency table for those morphemes deviates significantly from the ideal Zipf law, at both ends of the range.

Even in English, the deviations from the ideal Zipf&#x27;s law become more apparent as one examines large collections of texts. Analysis of a corpus of 30,000 English texts showed that only about 15% of the texts in it have a good fit to Zipf&#x27;s law. Slight changes in the definition of Zipf&#x27;s law can increase this percentage up to close to 50%.

In these cases, the observed frequency-rank relation can be modeled more accurately as by separate Zipf–Mandelbrot laws distributions for different subsets or subtypes of words. This is the case for the frequency-rank plot of the first 10 million words of the English Wikipedia. In particular, the frequencies of the closed class of function words in English is better described with lower than 1, while open-ended vocabulary growth with document size and corpus size require greater than 1 for convergence of the Generalized Harmonic Series.

When a text is encrypted in such a way that every occurrence of each distinct plaintext word is always mapped to the same encrypted word (as in the case of simple substitution ciphers, like the Caesar ciphers, or simple codebook ciphers), the frequency-rank distribution is not affected. On the other hand, if separate occurrences of the same word may be mapped to two or more different words (as happens with the Vigenère cipher), the Zipf distribution will typically have a flat part at the high-frequency end.

====Applications====
Zipf&#x27;s law has been used for extraction of parallel fragments of texts out of comparable corpora. Laurance Doyle and others have suggested the application of Zipf&#x27;s law for detection of alien language in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

The frequency-rank word distribution is often characteristic of the author and changes little over time. This feature has been used in the analysis of texts for authorship attribution.

The word-like sign groups of the 15th-century codex Voynich Manuscript have been found to satisfy Zipf&#x27;s law, suggesting that text is most likely not a hoax but rather written in an obscure language or cipher.

<doc id="43221" wikidata="Q207810" url="?curid=43221" title="E number">
<text>E numbers, short for Europe numbers, are codes for substances used as food additives, including those found naturally in many foods, such as vitamin C, for use within the European Union (EU)&lt;ref name=&quot;1333/2008&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Commonly found on food labels, their safety assessment and approval are the responsibility of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The fact that an additive has an E number implies that its use was at one time permitted in products for sale in the European Single Market; some of these additives are no longer allowed today.

Having a single unified list for food additives was first agreed upon in 1962 with food colouring. In 1964, the directives for preservatives were added, in 1970 antioxidants were added, in 1974 emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickeners and gelling agents were added as well.

==Numbering schemes==
The numbering scheme follows that of the International Numbering System (INS) as determined by the &quot;Codex Alimentarius&quot; committee, though only a subset of the INS additives are approved for use in the European Union as food additives. Outside the European continent plus Russia, E numbers are also encountered on food labelling in other jurisdictions, including the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and India.

==Colloquial use==
In some European countries, the &quot;E number&quot; is used informally as a derogatory term for artificial food additives. For example, in the UK, food companies are required to include the &quot;E number(s)&quot; in the ingredients that are added as part of the manufacturing process. Many components of naturally occurring healthy foods and vitamins have assigned E numbers (and the number is a synonym for the chemical component), e.g. vitamin C (E300) and lycopene (E160d), found in carrots. At the same time, &quot;E number&quot; is sometimes misunderstood to imply approval for safe consumption. This is not necessarily the case, e.g. Avoparcin (E715) is an antibiotic once used in animal feed, but is no longer permitted in the EU, and has never been permitted for human consumption. Sodium nitrite (E250) is toxic. Sulfuric acid (E513) is caustic.

==Classification by numeric range==

Not all examples of a class fall into the given numeric range; moreover, certain chemicals (particularly in the E400–499 range) have a variety of purposes.

==Full list==
The list shows all components that have an E-number assigned, &quot;even those no longer allowed in the EU&quot;.

===E100–E199 (colours)===
=== E200–E299 (preservatives) ===
===E300–E399 (antioxidants, acidity regulators) ===
===E400–E499 (thickeners, stabilisers, emulsifiers) ===
===E500–E599 (acidity regulators, anti-caking agents) ===

<doc id="43223" wikidata="Q44980" url="?curid=43223" title="Alex Ferguson">
<text>Sir Alexander Chapman Ferguson (born 31 December 1941) is a Scottish retired football manager and former player, best known for managing Manchester United from 1986 to 2013. He is widely regarded as the greatest manager of all time and has won more trophies (49) than any other manager in the history of football. Ferguson is often credited for valuing youth during his time at Manchester United, particularly in the 1990s with the &quot;Class of &#x27;92&quot;, who contributed to making the club one of the richest and most successful in the world.

Ferguson played as a forward for several Scottish clubs, including Dunfermline Athletic and Rangers. While playing for Dunfermline, he was the top goalscorer in the Scottish league during the 1965–66 season. Towards the end of his playing career, he also worked as a coach, then started his managerial career with East Stirlingshire and St Mirren. Ferguson then enjoyed a highly successful period as manager of Aberdeen, winning three Scottish league championships, four Scottish Cups and both the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and the UEFA Super Cup in 1983. He briefly managed Scotland following the death of Jock Stein, taking the team to the 1986 World Cup.

Ferguson was appointed manager of Manchester United in November 1986. During his 26 years with Manchester United, he won 38 trophies, including 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, and two UEFA Champions League titles. He was knighted in the 1999 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours list for his services to the game. Ferguson is the longest-serving manager of Manchester United, having overtaken Sir Matt Busby&#x27;s record on 19 December 2010. He retired from management at the end of the 2012–13 season, having won the Premier League in his final season.

==Early life==
Alexander Chapman Ferguson was born at his grandmother&#x27;s home on Shieldhall Road in the Govan district of Glasgow on 31 December 1941, the son of Elizabeth (née Hardie) and Alexander Beaton Ferguson. His father was a plater&#x27;s helper in the shipbuilding industry. He grew up in a tenement at 667 Govan Road, which has since been demolished, where he lived with his parents and his younger brother Martin, who also became a footballer. He attended Broomloan Road Primary School and later Govan High School. He began his football career with Harmony Row Boys Club in Govan, before progressing to Drumchapel Amateurs, a youth club with a strong reputation for producing senior footballers. He also took an apprenticeship as a toolmaker at a factory in Hillington, being appointed a union shop steward.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Ferguson&#x27;s playing career began as an amateur with Queen&#x27;s Park, where he made his debut as a striker, aged 16. He described his first match as a &quot;nightmare&quot;, but scored Queen&#x27;s Park&#x27;s goal in a 2–1 defeat against Stranraer. Perhaps his most notable game for Queen&#x27;s Park was the 7–1 defeat away to Queen of the South on Boxing Day 1959 when ex-England international Ivor Broadis scored four of the Queen of the South goals. Ferguson was the solitary Queen&#x27;s Park goalscorer.

Despite scoring 20 goals in his 31 games for Queen&#x27;s Park, he could not command a regular place in the side and moved to St Johnstone in 1960. Ferguson was on a part-time contract with St Johnstone, and he combined working in a Govan shipyard with training at night in Perth. Although he regularly scored goals for St Johnstone, he was unable to command a consistent place in their team. He regularly requested transfers, and even considered emigrating to Canada. St Johnstone&#x27;s failure to sign another forward led the manager to select Ferguson for a match against Rangers, in which he scored a hat-trick in a surprise 3–2 victory at Ibrox.

Dunfermline signed him the following summer (1964), and Ferguson became a full-time professional footballer. In the following season (1964–65) Dunfermline were strong challengers for the Scottish league title and reached the Scottish Cup Final, but Ferguson was dropped for the final after a poor performance in a league game against St Johnstone. Dunfermline lost the final 3–2 to Celtic, then failed to win the League by one point. The 1965–66 season saw Ferguson notch up 45 goals in 51 games for Dunfermline. Along with Joe McBride of Celtic, he was the top goalscorer in the Scottish league with 31 goals.

Ferguson then joined Rangers for £65,000, which was a record fee for a transfer between two Scottish clubs. He performed well in Europe during his two seasons with the club, scoring six goals in nine appearances in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup including two against 1.FC Köln in the 1967–68 competition, and an important strike against Athletic Bilbao in the 1968–69 edition which helped Rangers into the semi-finals, but on both occasions they were knocked out by English opposition. He was blamed for a goal conceded in the 1969 Scottish Cup Final, in a match in which he was designated to mark Celtic captain, Billy McNeill, and was subsequently forced to play for the club&#x27;s junior side instead of for the first team. According to his brother, Ferguson was so upset by the experience that he threw his losers&#x27; medal away.

There have been claims that he suffered discrimination at Rangers due to his marriage to a Catholic, Cathy Holding. Ferguson said in a 2021 documentary film about his life and career (&quot;Sir Alex Ferguson: Never Give In&quot;) that he &quot;assumed&quot; that his exclusion from the first team after the 1969 cup final was due to her religion. His autobiography noted that Rangers had known of his wife&#x27;s religion when he joined the club. In March 2021, he added that when he was signed, a Rangers director had questioned whether the Fergusons had been married in a (Catholic) chapel, and that the director had replied &quot;oh, that&#x27;s okay&quot; when told they had married in a registry office. Ferguson left Rangers reluctantly, as he had grown up locally and had dreamed of succeeding there. He was upset by how newspapers would refer to him as an &quot;ex-Rangers player&quot; after he had left, and rarely attended gatherings of their former players.

The following October, Nottingham Forest wanted to sign Ferguson, but his wife was not keen on moving to England at that time, so he went to Falkirk instead. He remained at Brockville for four years, gaining more league appearances than he had elsewhere; in recognition of his experience he was promoted to player-coach, but when John Prentice became manager he removed Ferguson&#x27;s coaching responsibilities. Ferguson&#x27;s time at Falkirk was soured by this, and he responded by requesting a transfer and moved to Ayr United, where he finished his playing career in 1974.

===International===
Ferguson&#x27;s only involvement with the Scotland national team was during an overseas tour in 1967. For many years none of the tour matches were recognised by the Scottish Football Association as full internationals, and so Ferguson was deemed to have never played for Scotland. A &quot;BBC Sport&quot; article in June 2020 identified him as one of the best Scottish players to have never played a full international. The SFA announced in October 2021 that some of the tour matches would be reclassified as full internationals, which meant that Ferguson was belatedly awarded an international cap.

==Managerial career==

===East Stirlingshire===
In June 1974, Ferguson was appointed manager of East Stirlingshire, at the comparatively young age of 32. It was a part-time job that paid £40 per week, and the club did not have a single goalkeeper at the time. He gained a reputation as a disciplinarian, with club forward Bobby McCulley later saying he had &quot;never been afraid of anyone before but Ferguson was a frightening bastard from the start.&quot;

===St Mirren===
In October 1974, Ferguson was invited to manage St Mirren. While they were below East Stirlingshire in the league, they were a bigger club and although Ferguson felt a degree of loyalty towards East Stirlingshire, he decided to join St Mirren after taking advice from Jock Stein.

Ferguson was manager of St Mirren from 1974 until 1978, producing a remarkable transformation of a team in the lower half of the old Second Division watched by crowds of just over 1,000, to First Division champions in 1977, discovering talent like Billy Stark, Tony Fitzpatrick, Lex Richardson, Frank McGarvey, Bobby Reid and Peter Weir while playing superb attacking football. The average age of the league winning team was 19 and the captain, Fitzpatrick, was 20.

St Mirren have the distinction of being the only club ever to sack Ferguson. He claimed wrongful dismissal against the club at an industrial tribunal but lost and was given no leave to appeal. According to a &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; article on 30 May 1999, the official version is that Ferguson was sacked for various breaches of contract, including unauthorised payments to players. He was counter-accused of intimidating behaviour towards his office secretary because he wanted players to get some expenses tax free. He did not speak to her for six weeks, confiscated her keys and communicated only through a 17-year-old assistant. The tribunal concluded that Ferguson was &quot;particularly petty&quot; and &quot;immature&quot;. It was claimed during the tribunal by St Mirren chairman, Willie Todd, that Ferguson had &quot;no managerial ability&quot;.

In 2008, &quot;The Guardian&quot; published an interview with Todd (then aged 87), who had sacked Ferguson many years earlier. Todd said that the fundamental reason for the dismissal was a breach of contract relating to Ferguson having agreed to join Aberdeen. Ferguson told journalist Jim Rodger of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; that he had asked at least one member of the squad to go to Aberdeen with him. He told the St Mirren staff he was leaving. Todd expressed regret over what happened but blamed Aberdeen for not approaching his club to discuss compensation.

In 1977, Ferguson turned down the manager&#x27;s job at Aberdeen. The role went to Billy McNeill, who returned to Celtic after only a year, leaving the role available for Ferguson once again.

===Aberdeen===

====Late 1970s====
Ferguson joined Aberdeen as manager in June 1978, replacing Billy McNeill who had only managed the club for one season before he was offered the chance to manage Celtic. Although Aberdeen were one of Scotland&#x27;s major clubs they had won the league only once, in 1955 under Dave Halliday. The team had been playing well, however, and had not lost a league match since the previous December, having finished second in the league the previous season. Ferguson had now been a manager for four years, but was still not much older than some of the players and had trouble winning the respect of some of the older ones such as Joe Harper. The season did not go especially well, with Aberdeen reaching the semi-final of the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup Final, but losing both matches and finishing fourth in the league.

Aberdeen lost the 1979–80 Scottish League Cup Final, this time to Dundee United after a replay. Ferguson took the blame for the defeat, saying he should have made changes to the team for the replay.

====1980s and silverware====
Aberdeen had started the 1979–80 season poorly but their form improved dramatically in the new year and they won the Scottish league that season with a 5–0 win on the final day. It was the first time in 15 years that the league had not been won by either Rangers or Celtic. Ferguson now felt that he had the respect of his players, later saying: &quot;That was the achievement which united us. I finally had the players believing in me&quot;.

He was still a strict disciplinarian, though, and his players nicknamed him &quot;Furious Fergie&quot;. He fined one of his players, John Hewitt, for overtaking him on a public road, and kicked a tea urn at the players at half time after a poor first half. He was dissatisfied with the atmosphere at Aberdeen matches, and deliberately created a &quot;siege mentality&quot; by accusing the Scottish media of being biased towards the Glasgow clubs, to motivate the team. The team continued their success with a Scottish Cup win in 1982. Ferguson was offered the manager&#x27;s job at Wolverhampton Wanderers but turned it down as he felt that Wolves were in trouble and his &quot;ambitions at Aberdeen were not even half fulfilled&quot;.

====European success and Scottish national side====
Ferguson led Aberdeen to even greater success the following season, 1982–83. They had qualified for the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup as a result of winning the Scottish Cup the previous season, and impressively knocked out Bayern Munich, who had beaten Tottenham Hotspur 4–1 in the previous round. According to Willie Miller, this gave them the confidence to believe that they could go on to win the competition, which they did, with a 2–1 victory over Real Madrid in the final on 11 May 1983. Aberdeen became only the third Scottish team to win a European trophy and Ferguson now felt that &quot;he&#x27;d done something worthwhile with his life&quot;. This was followed up with victory in the European Super Cup in December 1983, when Hamburger SV, the reigning European Cup champions, were beaten 2–0 over two legs. Aberdeen had also performed well in the league that season, and retained the Scottish Cup with a 1–0 victory over Rangers, but Ferguson was not happy with his team&#x27;s play in that match and upset the players by describing theirs as a &quot;disgraceful performance&quot; in a televised interview after the match, a statement he later retracted.

After a sub-standard start to the 1983–84 season, Aberdeen&#x27;s form improved and the team won the Scottish league and retained the Scottish Cup. Ferguson was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1985 New Year Honours, and was offered the managers&#x27; jobs at Rangers and Arsenal during the season. Aberdeen retained their league title in the 1984–85 season. In 1985–86, Aberdeen won both domestic cups, but finished fourth in the league. Ferguson had been appointed to the club&#x27;s board of directors early in 1986, but that April he told Dick Donald, their chairman, that he intended to leave that summer.

Ferguson had been part of the coaching staff for the Scottish national side during qualifying for the 1986 World Cup, but manager Jock Stein had collapsed and died on 10 September 1985 – at the end of the game in which Scotland qualified from their group for a play-off against Australia. Ferguson promptly agreed to take charge of the Scottish national side against the Australians and subsequently at the World Cup. To allow him to fulfil his international duties he appointed Archie Knox as his co-manager at Aberdeen. However, after Scotland failed to progress past the group stages of the World Cup, Ferguson stepped down as national team manager on 15 June 1986.

Around this time, Tottenham Hotspur offered Ferguson the chance to take over from Peter Shreeves as manager, but he rejected this offer and the job went to Luton Town&#x27;s David Pleat instead. There was also an offer for Ferguson to replace Don Howe as Arsenal manager, but he rejected this offer as well, and fellow Scot George Graham took the post instead. That summer, there had been speculation that he would take over from Ron Atkinson at Manchester United, who had slumped to fourth in the English top flight after a ten-match winning start.

It was not the first time that Ferguson had been linked with a move to England. In February 1982, Wolverhampton Wanderers had approached him about succeeding John Barnwell as manager as they were heading for relegation from the First Division. He rejected this offer, perhaps concerned about the club&#x27;s financial stability, as they were more than £2 million in debt at the time and narrowly avoided going out of business. At the end of the 1984–85 season, it was reported that Ferguson was being considered for the Liverpool manager&#x27;s job after the retirement of Joe Fagan was announced, but the job was quickly accepted by Liverpool striker Kenny Dalglish.

Although Ferguson remained at Aberdeen over the summer, he did eventually join Manchester United when Atkinson was sacked in November 1986.

===Manchester United===

====Appointment and first FA Cup title====
Ferguson was appointed manager at Old Trafford on 6 November 1986. He was initially worried that many of the players, such as Norman Whiteside, Paul McGrath and Bryan Robson were drinking too much and was &quot;depressed&quot; by their level of fitness, but he managed to increase the players&#x27; discipline and United climbed up the table to finish the season in 11th place, having been 21st (second from bottom) when he took over.

His first game in charge was a 2–0 defeat at Oxford United on 8 November, followed seven days later by a goalless draw at newly promoted Norwich City, and then his first win (1–0 at home to Queens Park Rangers) on 22 November. Results steadily improved as the season went on, and by the time they recorded what would be their only away win of the league campaign at title challengers and rivals Liverpool on Boxing Day, it was clear that United were on the road to recovery. The year 1987 began on a high note with a 4–1 victory over Newcastle United and United gradually pulled together in the second half of the season, with relatively occasional defeats on the way, and finished 11th in the final table. Ferguson&#x27;s mother Elizabeth died of lung cancer, aged 64, three weeks after his appointment. Ferguson hired Archie Knox, his assistant at Aberdeen, in the same role at Manchester United in 1986.

In the 1987–88 season, Ferguson made several major signings, including Steve Bruce, Viv Anderson and Brian McClair. The new players made a positive contribution to a United team who finished in second place, nine points behind Liverpool. Liverpool&#x27;s points lead, however, had been in double digits for most of the season and while United had lost only five league games all season, they drew 12 games, leaving some way to go before United could match their northwestern rivals.

During the season, United played two friendly matches in Bermuda against the Bermuda national team and the Somerset Cricket Club. In the match against Somerset, both Ferguson himself and his assistant Archie Knox took to the field, with Knox even getting on the scoresheet. The match was Ferguson&#x27;s only appearance for the Manchester United first team.

United were expected to do well when Mark Hughes returned to the club two years after leaving for Barcelona, alongside Jim Leighton from Aberdeen; but the 1988–89 season was a disappointment for them, finishing 11th in the league and losing 1–0 at home to Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup sixth round. They had begun the season slowly, going on a nine-match winless run throughout October and November (with one defeat and eight draws) before a run of generally good results took them to third place and the fringes of the title challenge by mid February. However, another run of disappointing results in the final quarter of the season saw them fall down to mid-table.

For the 1989–90 season, Ferguson further boosted his squad by paying large sums of money for midfielders Neil Webb, Mike Phelan, and Paul Ince, as well as defender Gary Pallister and winger Danny Wallace. The season began well with a 4–1 win over defending champions Arsenal on the opening day, but United&#x27;s league form quickly turned sour. In September, United suffered a humiliating 5–1 away defeat against fierce rivals Manchester City. Following this and an early season run of six defeats and two draws in eight games, a banner declaring, &quot;Three years of excuses and it&#x27;s still crap ... ta-ra Fergie.&quot; was displayed at Old Trafford, and many journalists and supporters called for Ferguson to be sacked. Ferguson later described December 1989 as &quot;the darkest period [he had] ever suffered in the game&quot;, as United ended the decade just outside the relegation zone.

Following a run of seven games without a win, Manchester United were drawn away to Nottingham Forest in the third round of the FA Cup. Forest were performing well that season and were in the process of winning the League Cup for the second season running, and it was expected that United would lose the match and Ferguson would consequently be sacked, but United won the game 1–0 due to a Mark Robins goal and eventually reached the final. This cup win is often cited as the match that saved Ferguson&#x27;s Old Trafford career. United went on to win the FA Cup, beating Crystal Palace 1–0 in the final replay after a 3–3 draw in the first match, giving Ferguson his first major trophy as Manchester United manager. United&#x27;s defensive frailties in the first match were blamed on goalkeeper Jim Leighton. Ferguson dropped Leighton for the replay, bringing in Les Sealey.

====United&#x27;s European firsts and Ferguson&#x27;s seconds====

Although United&#x27;s league form improved greatly in 1990–91, they were still inconsistent and finished sixth. There were some excellent performances that season, including a 6–2 demolition of Arsenal at Highbury, but results like an early 2–1 loss at newly promoted Sunderland, a 4–0 September hammering by Liverpool at Anfield, and a 2–0 home defeat by Everton in early March (the game where 17-year-old talented prospect Ryan Giggs made his senior debut) showed that United still had some way to go.

Even after the FA Cup victory in the previous season, some still had doubts about Ferguson&#x27;s ability to succeed where all the other managers since Matt Busby had failed – to win the league title. They were runners-up in the League Cup, losing 1–0 to Sheffield Wednesday. However, they won the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, beating that season&#x27;s Spanish champions Barcelona 2–1. It would be United&#x27;s only Cup Winners&#x27; Cup title. After the match, Ferguson vowed that United would win the league the following season, and at long last he seemed to have won over the last of his sceptics after nearly five years in the job.

During the 1991 close season, Ferguson&#x27;s assistant Archie Knox departed to Rangers to become assistant to Walter Smith, and Ferguson promoted youth team coach Brian Kidd to the role of assistant manager in Knox&#x27;s place. He also made two major signings – goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and defender Paul Parker – to bolster his side. There was much anticipation about the breakthrough of the young Ryan Giggs, who had played twice and scored once in the 1990–91 campaign, and the earlier emergence of another impressive young winger in the shape of Lee Sharpe, who despite their youth had made Ferguson feel able to resist plunging into the transfer market and buying a new player to take over from the disappointing Danny Wallace on the left wing. He had also added Soviet midfielder Andrei Kanchelskis to the right wing, giving him a more attacking alternative to older midfielders Mike Phelan and Bryan Robson.

The 1991–92 season did not live up to Ferguson&#x27;s expectations and, in Ferguson&#x27;s words, &quot;many in the media felt that [his] mistakes had contributed to the misery&quot;. United won the League Cup and European Super Cup; both for the first time, but lost out on the league title to rivals Leeds United after leading the table for much of the season. A shortage of goals and being held to draws by teams they had been expected to beat in the second half of the campaign had proved to be the undoing of a United side who had performed so well in the first half of the season. Ferguson felt that his failure to secure the signing of Mick Harford from Luton Town had cost United the league, and that he needed &quot;an extra dimension&quot; to the team if they were to win the league the following season.

During the 1992 close season, Ferguson went on the hunt for a new striker. He first attempted to sign Alan Shearer from Southampton, but lost out to Blackburn Rovers. He also made at least one approach for the Sheffield Wednesday striker David Hirst, but manager Trevor Francis rejected all offers and the player stayed put. In the end, he paid £1 million for 23-year-old Cambridge United striker Dion Dublin – his only major signing of the summer.

After a slow start to the 1992–93 season by sitting 10th at the beginning of November, it looked as though United would miss out on the league title yet again. However, after the purchase of French striker Eric Cantona from Leeds for £1.2 million, the future of Manchester United, and Ferguson&#x27;s position as manager, began to look bright. Cantona formed a strong partnership with Mark Hughes. On 10 April 1993, United were second in the league when they faced Sheffield Wednesday at home. United were losing with four minutes to go before Steve Bruce equalised. After seven minutes of injury time – which was subsequently dubbed &quot;Fergie Time&quot;, alluding to extra minutes allegedly being granted to Ferguson&#x27;s teams to get a goal – Bruce scored the 97th-minute winner, with Ferguson celebrating the goal by running from his dugout on to the touch line, while assistant Brian Kidd ran on to the field. Seen as being a decisive victory, it put United top of the league, where they remained. Winning the title ended United&#x27;s 26-year wait for a league title, and also made them the first Premier League champions. United finished with a ten-point margin over runners-up Aston Villa, whose 1–0 defeat at Oldham Athletic on 2 May 1993 had given United the title. Ferguson was later voted Manager of the Year by the League Managers&#x27; Association.

====1993–95: Double win and loss====
The 1993–94 season brought more success. Ferguson added Nottingham Forest&#x27;s 22-year-old midfielder Roy Keane to the ranks for a British record fee of £3.75 million as a long term replacement for Bryan Robson, who was nearing the end of his career. United led the 1993–94 Premier League table virtually from start to finish. Ferguson was the first winner of the Premier League Manager of the Month award, introduced for the start of the 1993–94 season, when he collected the accolade for August 1993. Cantona was top scorer with 25 goals in all competitions despite being sent off twice in the space of five days in March 1994. United also reached the League Cup final but lost 3–1 to Aston Villa, managed by Ferguson&#x27;s predecessor, Ron Atkinson. In the FA Cup final, Manchester United achieved an impressive 4–0 scoreline against Chelsea, winning Ferguson his second League and Cup Double, following his Scottish Premier Division and Scottish Cup titles with Aberdeen in 1984–85, though the League Cup final defeat meant that he had not yet achieved a repeat of the treble that he had achieved with Aberdeen in 1983.

Ferguson made only one close-season signing, paying Blackburn £1.2 million for David May. There were newspaper reports that Ferguson was also going to sign highly rated 21-year-old striker Chris Sutton from Norwich City, but the player headed for Blackburn instead. 1994–95 was a harder season for Ferguson. Cantona assaulted a Crystal Palace supporter in a game at Selhurst Park, and it seemed likely he would leave English football. An eight-month ban saw Cantona miss the final four months of the season. He also received a 14-day prison sentence for the offence but the sentence was quashed on appeal and replaced by a 120-hour community service order. United paid a British record fee of £7 million for Newcastle United&#x27;s prolific striker Andy Cole, with young winger Keith Gillespie heading to the north-east in exchange. The season also saw the breakthrough of young players Gary Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, who provided excellent cover for the long periods that United were left without some of their more experienced stars. However, the championship slipped out of Manchester United&#x27;s grasp as they drew 1–1 with West Ham United on the final day of the season, when a win would have given them a third successive league title. United also lost the FA Cup final in a 1–0 defeat by Everton.

====1995–98====
Ferguson was heavily criticised in the summer of 1995 when three of United&#x27;s star players were allowed to leave and replacements were not bought. First Paul Ince moved to Internazionale of Italy for £7.5 million, long-serving striker Mark Hughes was sold to Chelsea in a £1.5 million deal, and Andrei Kanchelskis was sold to Everton. Ferguson felt that United had a number of young players who were ready to play in the first team. The youngsters, who would be known as &quot;Fergie&#x27;s Fledglings&quot;, included Gary Neville, Phil Neville, David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, who would all go on to be important members of the team. And so the 1995–96 season began without a major signing, at a time when the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle were making the headlines with big-money signings.

A youthful United team lost 3–1 in their opening league game of the 1995–96 season, against Aston Villa. On &quot;Match of the Day&quot;, pundit Alan Hansen criticised their performance, ending his analysis with the words, &quot;You can&#x27;t win anything with kids.&quot; United won their next five matches and were boosted by the return of Cantona, who made his comeback against Liverpool in October 1995. For much of the season, the team trailed league leaders Newcastle and found themselves ten points behind by Christmas; this later was narrowed to seven points after defeating them on 27 December 1995. The gap increased to 12 points, but a series of wins, coupled with Newcastle dropping points, meant by late March, United moved to the top of the table. In a televised outburst after his team&#x27;s win against Leeds, Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan responded angrily to Ferguson&#x27;s comments: &quot;We&#x27;re still fighting for this title, and he&#x27;s got to go to Middlesbrough... I would love it if we beat them, love it.&quot; A win against Middlesbrough on the final day sealed the title for United and the team beat Liverpool by a goal to nil to win the 1996 FA Cup Final; this was their second double in three years. A week after the cup final, Ferguson agreed a four-year contract to remain at United.

United started the following season thrashing the previous year&#x27;s league runners-up Newcastle 4-0 in the Charity Shield. They went on to win their fourth league title in five seasons at the end of the 1996–97 campaign, made easier by the fact that their rivals were &quot;not up to the job&quot;. Under Ferguson, the team made a better go in the Champions League and reached the semi-final stage for the first time in 28 years. United did not advance any further, after defeat by Borussia Dortmund of Germany. Norwegian signings Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Ronny Johnsen were the notable additions to the squad, with the former ending the season as the club&#x27;s top goalscorer. In May 1997, Cantona informed Ferguson of his decision to retire from football. The player &quot;felt exploited by United&#x27;s merchandising department&quot; and questioned the ambition of the club, reasons which Ferguson understood. Striker Teddy Sheringham was signed as Cantona&#x27;s replacement from Tottenham Hotspur, with Blackburn defender Henning Berg the other significant purchase that summer. In the close season, United appointed Keane as their new captain. Ferguson described him as &quot;the best all-round player in the game&quot; after the team&#x27;s 1997 FA Charity Shield win and believed Keane had &quot;all the right ingredients&quot; to succeed from Cantona.

Defeat by Leeds United in September 1997 was the team&#x27;s first league loss in seven months; Keane during the match injured himself and was subsequently ruled out for the rest of the season with ligament damage. Goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel was placed as captain in his absence. By November, United opened up a four-point lead in the league, which prompted talk of whether any team could catch them. After Arsenal&#x27;s defeat of United in the same month, Ferguson acknowledged a one-horse race was &quot;not good for the game&quot; and admitted his opponents &quot;... deserved to win on their second-half performance&quot;. The fallibilities of Liverpool, Chelsea and Blackburn as league challengers allowed United during the winter to extend their lead by 11 points, albeit with Arsenal having games-in-hand. This was enough for Manchester bookmaker Fred Done to pay out on punters who backed the champions retaining their title.

Arsenal collected maximum points, sealing the title with a win against Everton on 3 May 1998. Ferguson congratulated his opponent Arsène Wenger, who in his first full season at the club, later completed the double: &quot;I think it&#x27;s good for my young players to lose on this occasion. I wholeheartedly acknowledge what Arsenal achieved between Christmas and the end of the season.&quot; United straight after paid £10.75 million for PSV defender Jaap Stam, a new club record fee. Ferguson wanted to strengthen the squad&#x27;s attacking options and identified Aston Villa&#x27;s Dwight Yorke as his main target. Attempts to sign Yorke were rebuffed at first, before Ferguson persuaded Edwards to increase United&#x27;s initial offer of £10 million. A £12.6 million deal was reached a week into the league campaign; Yorke signed minutes before the deadline to submit United&#x27;s squad for the Champions League.

====1998–99: Treble success====
United opened the 1998–99 season with a 3–0 loss to Arsenal in the 1998 FA Charity Shield. The beating did not concern Ferguson, though he described his team&#x27;s defeat by Arsenal in September 1998 as &quot;a lot less tolerable&quot;. In December 1998, Kidd left his role as assistant to become the manager of Blackburn Rovers. Ferguson instructed Eric Harrison and Les Kershaw to find suitable replacements, &quot;in terms of coaching ability and work ethic.&quot; Both recommended Steve McClaren, the assistant to Jim Smith at Derby County. McClaren was Ferguson&#x27;s initial choice and appointed him in February 1999. His first game as assistant was United&#x27;s 8–1 victory over Nottingham Forest.

Ferguson felt United&#x27;s bid to regain the Premier League began indifferently because of their commitments to other competitions. He was willing to &quot;pay for the progress&quot; made in the Champions League; the team finished second in their Champions League &quot;group of death&quot;, behind Bayern Munich and ahead of Barcelona. United&#x27;s win against Liverpool in the FA Cup fourth round was a portent for the remainder of the season. A goal down after three minutes, the team equalised in the 86th minute and scored the winning goal through Solskjær in stoppage time. On reflection, Ferguson said it was &quot;a demonstration of the morale that was to be every bit as vital as rich skill in the five months that lay ahead of United&quot;.
In the final weeks of the league season, Arsenal emerged as a creditable challenger to United. Both clubs were also paired together in the semi-final of the FA Cup, decided by a replay as the original game finished goalless. Keane was sent off in the second half and United conceded a penalty late into the match with the score 1–1. Dennis Bergkamp&#x27;s effort was saved by Peter Schmeichel. Ferguson hoped his team &quot;could at least take it to a penalty shoot-out&quot;, but instead the match was settled in extra time: Giggs ran the length of the pitch and evaded several Arsenal players to score the winning goal. United went on to beat Newcastle United in the FA Cup final and completed the double – a week earlier the team had regained the Premiership title.

United&#x27;s progression in the Champions League was promising compared to previous seasons. The team eliminated Inter Milan at the quarter-final stage and faced Juventus in the last four of the competition. A late goal scored by Giggs in the first leg earned the team a 1–1 draw, but in spite of conceding an away goal, Ferguson was adamant of United&#x27;s chances of reaching the final: &quot;... something tells me we are going to win. The nature of our club is that we torture ourselves so much that the only way to get relief is by winning over there.&quot; At the Stadio delle Alpi, striker Filippo Inzaghi scored twice to put Juventus 3–1 up on aggregate. Keane headed in a Beckham cross to halve the deficit just before half-time, but was later shown a yellow card for a foul on Edgar Davids, which prevented him from playing in the final. Yorke equalised, before Cole added a third to win the match outright. Keane&#x27;s performance merited praise from Ferguson:
Days after the FA Cup final, United travelled to Barcelona, the setting for the UEFA Champions League final. Ferguson contemplated his team selection against Bayern Munich; suspensions to Scholes and Keane ruled both players out of the match. Beckham was positioned in centre midfield, while Giggs moved to the right wing and Blomqvist started on the left – changes the manager felt would prevent the opposition from playing narrow. United conceded in the first six minutes of the final, from a Mario Basler&#x27;s free kick. Sheringham, who came on for Blomqvist, equalised from a corner in the first minute of additional time. McClaren told Ferguson to get the team organised for extra time, to which he replied, &quot;Steve, this game isn&#x27;t finished.&quot; Three minutes into added time, Solskjær scored the winner, which for United completed an unprecedented treble. Ferguson, interviewed moments after, said, &quot;I can&#x27;t believe it. Football, bloody hell. But they never gave in and that&#x27;s what won it.&quot; He and Schmeichel, the stand-in captain, jointly lifted the cup during the trophy presentation.

A crowd of over 500,000 people turned out on the streets of Manchester to greet the players, who paraded through the city in an open-top bus. As European champions, United were invited to play in the Intercontinental Cup. The club also entered the inaugural Club World Championship, which was held in Brazil. This brought about a potential fixture congestion so United accepted the FA&#x27;s recommendation of withdrawing from the FA Cup, the first holders to do so. In later years, Ferguson elaborated on the club&#x27;s decision: &quot;We did it to help England&#x27;s World Cup bid. That was the political situation. I regretted it because we got nothing but stick and terrible criticism for not being in the FA Cup when really, it wasn&#x27;t our fault.&quot;

====1999–2002: Title hat-trick, retirement plan====
Schmeichel&#x27;s decision to leave United after eight seasons prompted Ferguson to bring in replacements: Mark Bosnich from Aston Villa and Italian Massimo Taibi. The latter featured in four matches, the last of which a 5–0 defeat at Chelsea in October 1999; he was not selected again by Ferguson. United ended the 1999–2000 league season as champions, with just three defeats and a record points margin of 18. In December 1999, the club beat Palmeiras in Tokyo to win the Intercontinental Cup, but a month later exited at the group stage of the inaugural Club World Championship, although Ferguson stated the tournament was &quot;fantastic&quot;. United failed to retain the Champions League, as they lost in the quarter-final stage to eventual winners Real Madrid. Ferguson sought to strengthen his squad and signed Fabien Barthez from Monaco for £7.8 million. He also monitored the progress of Ruud van Nistelrooy, &quot;a striker of the highest calibre&quot;. He met the player and his agent in Manchester to discuss formalities and was informed of Van Nistelrooy&#x27;s troubled right knee. Ferguson was not agitated by this; he recalled from experience a similar niggle that did not stop his playing career. Van Nistelrooy, however, failed his medical, but Ferguson reassured him that &quot;we might yet find a way out of the nightmare&quot;. The deal was resurrected in April 2001 for a British record transfer fee of £19 million.

In the 2000–01 season, United retained the league title for a third season, becoming only the fourth side in history to do so. The achievement was overshadowed by reports of a rift between the club&#x27;s board and Ferguson. He told the club&#x27;s television channel MUTV that he was prepared to sever all ties with the club, once his contract ended the following year: &quot;The decision has been taken. I&#x27;m going to leave the club. I&#x27;m disappointed with what has happened because I was hoping something would be sorted out. It hasn&#x27;t happened as I thought it would and that&#x27;s all there is to it.&quot; Both parties eventually reached a compromise which pleased Ferguson: &quot;I am delighted we&#x27;ve settled this. When you have been at the club as long as I have it gets in your blood.&quot; Age was one of the factors in Ferguson&#x27;s decision to retire: reaching 60 acted as a &quot;psychological barrier ... It changed my sense of my own fitness, my health.&quot;

In May 2001, McClaren left to become Middlesbrough manager, with Jimmy Ryan being named assistant to Ferguson for the duration of the campaign. United once more broke their transfer record with the purchase of Juan Sebastián Verón from Lazio for a reported £28.1 million. In August 2001, Stam was transferred to Lazio for £16 million. The player reportedly moved because of claims in his autobiography &quot;Head to Head&quot;; Stam implied that Ferguson illegally contacted him about a move to Manchester United, before informing PSV. Ferguson said he sold the player because the club needed to cut back on its &quot;massive wage bill&quot;. He replaced the defender with Laurent Blanc, a long sought-after target. In an interview with Alastair Campbell eight years after, Ferguson described his biggest mistake at the club was &quot;letting go of Jaap Stam. No question&quot;.

The club endured a poor first half to the season and languished in ninth position after a home defeat by West Ham in December 2001. On the night of Christmas Day, Ferguson shelved his retirement plan. His family convinced him to remain in charge of United and Ferguson informed Watkins of his u-turn the following day.

Once Ferguson publicised his decision to remain in February 2002, United&#x27;s form improved. The team won 13 out of 15 matches, though finished third in the league behind Arsenal and Liverpool. United were unsuccessful in Europe, losing their Champions League semi-final on away goals to Bayer Leverkusen. Early exits from the League Cup and FA Cup meant they ended the season trophyless. Ferguson himself said that the decision to announce his retirement had resulted in a negative effect on the players and on his ability to impose discipline.

====2002–2006: Rebuilding and transition====
In June 2002, Ferguson appointed Carlos Queiroz as his new assistant. The recommendation came from Andy Roxburgh, at a time when United began scouting for southern-hemisphere footballers and wanted a multilingual coach. Ferguson was so impressed with Queiroz after their first meeting, he offered him the job &quot;right away&quot;. In July 2002, United paid £29.3 million for Leeds United defender Rio Ferdinand. The club broke the British transfer record once more, though this did not concern Ferguson: &quot;We have the right to try and improve ourselves and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.&quot;
The 2002–03 season began rather poorly for United; the club made their worst start to a league campaign in 13 years. In a column for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Hansen said Ferguson &quot;will recognise this difficult start to the season for what it is: the greatest challenge of his career&quot;. Ferguson&#x27;s response was typically bullish:
Several players were sent away for surgery in this period, a &quot;minor gamble&quot; Ferguson took in the hope they would return energised. Defeats, such as the one to Manchester City at Maine Road in November 2002, forced United to change their playing style. The team &quot;moved the ball forward more and quicker rather than concentrating on possession ratios,&quot; and the coaching staff tried accommodating Diego Forlán with Ruud van Nistelrooy, before settling with Paul Scholes. United&#x27;s league form improved as the season went on despite defeat by Liverpool in the 2003 Football League Cup Final and they overhauled Arsenal to win the Premier League for an eighth time in May 2003. The team were eliminated in the Champions League quarter-final to Real Madrid over two legs; Ferguson described the second match, a 4–3 win at Old Trafford as &quot;epic&quot;.

After a season at United, Queiroz left to manage Real Madrid in June 2003. Ferguson anticipated his deputy would return – &quot;Three months later, he was wanting to quit Madrid,&quot; and for that reason did not appoint a replacement. In the summer, David Beckham also moved to Real Madrid, while Juan Sebastián Verón joined Chelsea. United in the meantime rebuilt their team: Tim Howard replaced Barthez in goal and Kléberson, Eric Djemba-Djemba and Cristiano Ronaldo came in to bolster the squad. Ronaldinho might have also joined &quot;had he not said yes, then no, to our offer&quot;.

In December 2003, Rio Ferdinand was banned from playing football for eight months after he failed to present himself at a drugs test. Ferguson in his autobiography ten years later blamed the drug testers, who &quot;...didn&#x27;t do their job. They didn&#x27;t go looking for Rio&quot;. The absence of Ferdinand hampered United&#x27;s defence of the Premier League in the 2003–04 season; the team finished third behind Arsenal&#x27;s &quot;Invincibles&quot; and Chelsea. In Europe, they experienced defeat at the hands of eventual winners Porto. Ferguson felt it was possible &quot;not because of the performance of the players but because of the referee&quot;, who disallowed a legitimate Scholes goal that would have been enough to progress. United ended the campaign as FA Cup winners, beating Millwall 3–0 in the 2004 final.

At the beginning of the 2004–05 season, teenage striker Wayne Rooney (the world&#x27;s most expensive teenager at more than £20 million) and Argentine defender Gabriel Heinze joined United while Cristiano Ronaldo continued where he had left off the previous season by putting in more match-winning performances. But the lack of a striker after Ruud van Nistelrooy spent most of the season injured saw the club finish third for the third time in four seasons. In the 2004–05 FA Cup, they lost on penalties to Arsenal in the final. A second-round exit from the Champions League at the hands of Milan and a semi-final exit from the League Cup at the hands of eventual winners Chelsea (who also clinched the Premier League title) meant that 2004–05 was a rare instance of a trophyless season for United. During the season, Ferguson managed his 1,000th game in charge of United in a 2–1 home win against Lyon.

Ferguson&#x27;s preparations for the 2005–06 season were disrupted by a high-profile dispute with major shareholder John Magnier, over the ownership of the racehorse Rock of Gibraltar. When Magnier and business partner J. P. McManus agreed to sell their shares to American business tycoon Malcolm Glazer, it cleared the way for Glazer to acquire full control of the club. This sparked violent protests from United fans, and disrupted Ferguson&#x27;s plans to strengthen the team in the transfer market. In spite of this, United looked to solve their goalkeeping and midfield problems. For this, they signed the Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar from Fulham and Korean star Park Ji-sung from PSV.

The season was one of transition. On 18 November, Roy Keane officially left the club, his contract ended by mutual consent. United failed to qualify for the knock-out phase of the UEFA Champions League. In the January transfer window, Serbian defender Nemanja Vidić and French full-back Patrice Evra were signed, and the side finished in second place in the league, behind runaway winners Chelsea. Winning the League Cup was a consolation prize for lack of success elsewhere. Ruud van Nistelrooy&#x27;s future at Old Trafford was in doubt after not starting in the League Cup final, and he departed at the end of the season.

Before the start of the new season, Ferguson received much criticism, particular in the guise of an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; titled &quot;Shredding his legacy at every turn&quot;.

====Second Champions League trophy====

In 2006, Michael Carrick was signed to take Roy Keane&#x27;s place in the team for a fee that eventually rose to £18 million. United started the season well, and for the first time ever won their first four Premier League games, United&#x27;s best start since 1985. They set the early pace in the Premier League and never relinquished top spot from the tenth match of the 38-game season. The January 2006 signings had a huge impact on United&#x27;s performances – Patrice Evra and Nemanja Vidić came in to form a solid back line along with Rio Ferdinand and skipper Gary Neville. The signing of Carrick brought stability and further creativity in the United midfield, forming an effective partnership with Paul Scholes. Park Ji-sung and Ryan Giggs both underlined their value to the first team squad by adding significant pace and incisiveness in attack with Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Ferguson celebrated the 20th anniversary of his appointment as manager of Manchester United on 6 November 2006. Tributes also came from Ferguson&#x27;s players, both past and present, as well as his old foe, Arsène Wenger. The party was spoiled the following day when United endured a single-goal defeat at the hands of Southend United in the fourth round of the League Cup. On 1 December it was announced that Manchester United had signed 35-year-old Henrik Larsson on loan, a player that Ferguson had admired for many years, and attempted to capture previously. On 23 December 2006, Cristiano Ronaldo scored the club&#x27;s 2,000th goal under Ferguson in a match against Aston Villa.

Manchester United subsequently won their ninth Premier League title but were denied a unique fourth double by Chelsea&#x27;s Didier Drogba scoring a late goal in the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium. In the Champions League, the club reached the semi-finals, recording a 7–1 home win over Roma in the quarter-final second leg, but lost at the San Siro to Milan 3–0 in the second leg of the semi-final after being 3–2 up from the first leg.

For the 2007–08 season, Ferguson made notable signings to reinforce United&#x27;s first team. Long-term target Owen Hargreaves joined from Bayern Munich, young Portuguese winger Nani and Brazilian playmaker Anderson joined soon after, while the last summer signing was West Ham and Argentina striker Carlos Tevez after a complex and protracted transfer saga.

Despite getting some retribution on Chelsea by beating them in the Community Shield, United suffered their worst start to a league season under Ferguson, drawing their first two league games before suffering a 1–0 defeat by local rivals Manchester City. United, however, recovered and began a tight race with Arsenal for the title. After a good run of form, Ferguson claimed that throughout his time at Manchester United, this was the best squad he had managed to assemble thus far.

On 16 February 2008, United beat Arsenal 4–0 in an FA Cup fifth round match at Old Trafford, but were knocked out by eventual winners Portsmouth in the quarter-final on 8 March, losing 1–0 at home. United having had a penalty claim turned down, Ferguson alleged after the game that Keith Hackett, general manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Board, was &quot;not doing his job properly&quot;. Ferguson was subsequently charged by The FA with improper conduct, which he decided to contest. This was the second charge Ferguson faced in the season, following his complaints against the referee after United lost 1–0 at Bolton Wanderers – a charge he decided not to contest.

On 11 May 2008, Ferguson led Manchester United to a tenth Premier League title, exactly 25 years to the day after he led Aberdeen to European glory against Real Madrid in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. Nearest rivals Chelsea – level on points going into the final round of matches, but with an inferior goal difference – could only draw 1–1 at home to Bolton, finishing two points adrift of the champions. United&#x27;s title win was sealed with a 2–0 win over Wigan Athletic, managed by former United captain Steve Bruce.

On 21 May 2008, Ferguson won his second European Cup with Manchester United as they beat Chelsea 6–5 on penalties in the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, following a 1–1 draw after extra time in the first ever all-English UEFA Champions League Final. A penalty miss from Cristiano Ronaldo meant that John Terry&#x27;s spot-kick would have given the trophy to Chelsea if successfully converted, but Terry missed his penalty and in the end it was Edwin van der Sar&#x27;s blocking of a Nicolas Anelka penalty which gave the trophy to Manchester United for the second time under Ferguson and for the third time overall.

====World champions and further league titles ====

Although the team had a slow start to the 2008–09 season, United won the Premier League with a game to spare, making Ferguson the first manager in the history of English football to win the top division three times consecutively, on two separate occasions. Ferguson had now won 11 league titles at Manchester United, and the 2008–09 season title success put them level with Liverpool as league champions on a record 18 occasions in total. They also won the League Cup on penalties after a goalless draw in the final against Tottenham, after becoming the first British club to win the FIFA Club World Cup in December 2008.

They contested the Champions League final against Barcelona on 27 May 2009 but lost 2–0, thus failed to defend the trophy.

In 2009–10 season, Ferguson added another League Cup to his honours list as United defeated Aston Villa 2–1 in the final on 28 February 2010, United&#x27;s first ever successful knockout cup defence. However, his dreams of a third European Cup were ended a few weeks later when United were edged out of the competition in the quarter-finals by Bayern Munich on away goals. And their hopes of a record 19th league title were ended on the last day of the season when Chelsea beat them to the Premier League title by one point, crushing Wigan Athletic 8–0 and rendering United&#x27;s 4–0 win over Stoke City meaningless.

He ended the following season by winning his 12th and Manchester United&#x27;s 19th league title and thus overtaking Liverpool&#x27;s record of 18. Manchester United faced Barcelona again on 28 May 2011 in the 2011 Champions League final, their third in four years, but United lost 3–1. Analyst Alan Hansen stated that he believed Ferguson was &quot;the key component&quot; in United&#x27;s success that season, so key in fact that &quot;[he] would have claimed the crown with any of the other top sides had he been in charge of them&quot;. With Edwin van der Sar, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes all retiring in 2011, Ferguson spent big by signing defender Phil Jones from Blackburn and winger Ashley Young from Aston Villa for around £17 million each, and goalkeeper David de Gea from Atlético Madrid for around £19 million.

The following season United managed to beat rivals Manchester City in the 2011 FA Community Shield and eliminated them in the FA Cup third round, but ended the season below City, who won their first Premier League title on goal difference. This bitter and slim defeat prompted Ferguson to sign star-striker Robin van Persie, who was the Premier League Golden Boot title-holder, from another arch-rival Arsenal on 17 August 2012.

The 2012–13 season saw Ferguson guide United to become league champions for the 20th time, claiming the title with a 3–0 home win over Aston Villa on 22 April 2013 with four matches to spare; Van Persie scored all the goals with a first half hat-trick en route to retain the Golden Boot. His final game in charge, his 1,500th in total, saw United play out a 5–5 draw with West Bromwich Albion. The result meant United finished the season 11 points ahead of runners-up Manchester City. Earlier in the season, on 2 September 2012, Ferguson managed his 1,000th league game with United playing against Southampton. United won the game 3–2 thanks to another hat-trick from Van Persie. Two weeks later, he won his 100th game in the Champions League with a 1–0 win over Galatasaray at Old Trafford.

====Retirement====
On 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he had decided to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador. &quot;The Guardian&quot; announced it was the &quot;end of an era&quot;, while UEFA president Michel Platini referred to Ferguson as &quot;a true visionary&quot;. Former Manchester United players Paul Ince and Bryan Robson agreed that Ferguson would be &quot;a hard act to follow&quot;. Manchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer said, &quot;His determination to succeed and dedication to the club have been truly remarkable.&quot; Ferguson revealed that he had in fact decided that he was going to retire back in December 2012 and that it had been very difficult not to reveal his plans. Ferguson&#x27;s announcement of his decision to retire saw United&#x27;s shares fall 5% on the New York Stock Exchange.

On 9 May 2013, Manchester United announced Everton manager David Moyes would replace Ferguson as the club manager from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract. In Ferguson&#x27;s final match in charge, Manchester United drew 5–5 at West Bromwich Albion, a hat-trick from Romelu Lukaku, later a United player, denying Ferguson a final victory.

Ferguson released his second autobiography in October 2013 called &quot;My Autobiography&quot;. In January 2014, Ferguson was appointed as the UEFA Coaching Ambassador, and said it was &quot;an honour and a privilege&quot; to be given the role. In April 2014, it was announced that Ferguson would be taking up a &quot;long-term teaching position&quot; at Harvard University, where he would be lecturing on a new course titled &quot;The Business of Entertainment, Media and Sports&quot;. This came six months after he revealed his blueprint for success was included in the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; in a series of interviews with Anita Elberse. His book, &quot;Leading: Learning from Life and My Years at Manchester United&quot;, was published in collaboration with billionaire venture capitalist, author and former journalist Michael Moritz in August 2015.

==Controversies==

===Gordon Strachan===
Gordon Strachan was a key player for Ferguson at Aberdeen, but their relationship broke down when Strachan signed an agreement with German club FC Köln without telling Ferguson. Ferguson said that he believed although &quot;there was a cunning streak in Strachan, I had never imagined that he could pull such a stroke on me&quot;. Strachan did not sign for Köln, but instead moved to Manchester United in the summer of 1984. Strachan liked the move because he felt that Ron Atkinson treated him as an adult, unlike Ferguson. Strachan was still with the club when Ferguson was appointed manager in November 1986. Ferguson thought that Strachan did not play for United with the same confidence he had in Scotland and subsequently sold him to Leeds United in 1989. Strachan enjoyed significant success with Leeds as a veteran player, helping them win the 1991–92 English league championship in a title race with Ferguson&#x27;s United.

Their relationship continued to be frosty as Strachan moved into management himself. In his 1999 autobiography, Ferguson stated that Strachan &quot;could not be trusted an inch – I would not want to expose my back to him in a hurry&quot;. Strachan&#x27;s reaction to the attack, in his own autobiography, &quot;My Life in Football&quot;, was one of being &quot;surprised and disappointed&quot;, although he suspected that Ferguson had helped to relegate Strachan&#x27;s Coventry City in 2001 by fielding a weakened Manchester United team in a match against Derby County. By 2006 they appeared to have &quot;declared something of a truce&quot;, ahead of Champions League matches between United and Strachan&#x27;s Celtic.

===David Beckham===
In February 2003, Ferguson was involved in a dressing room argument with Manchester United player David Beckham. Ferguson allegedly kicked a football boot in frustration, which hit Beckham in the face and caused a minor injury. Ferguson apologised to Beckham, who was transferred to Real Madrid later that year.

===Champions League draw fixing===
On 5 April 2003, Ferguson claimed that the Champions League draw was fixed in favour of Spanish and Italian teams. UEFA charged Ferguson for bringing the game into disrepute with his comments. Ferguson apologised for his remarks and wrote a letter to UEFA in explanation, but he was fined 10,000 Swiss francs (£4,600) by the governing body.

===Rock of Gibraltar===
In 2003, Ferguson launched legal action against the then major Manchester United shareholder John Magnier over stud rights for race horse Rock of Gibraltar. Magnier counter-sued Ferguson by filing a &quot;Motion to Comply&quot; requiring Ferguson to substantiate his claim for half of Rock of Gibraltar&#x27;s stud fees. The legal issues were further compounded by Magnier being a significant shareholder in the football club managed by Ferguson at the time. Magnier requested that &quot;99 Questions&quot; be answered over Ferguson&#x27;s transfer dealings, including those of Jaap Stam, Juan Sebastián Verón, Tim Howard, David Bellion, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kléberson. The case was eventually settled out of Court.

===BBC===
Ferguson refused to give interviews to the BBC after a documentary called &quot;Fergie and Son&quot; was shown on BBC Three on 27 May 2004. According to an article in &quot;The Independent&quot;, the documentary had &quot;portrayed his agent son, Jason, as somebody who exploited his father&#x27;s influence and position to his own ends in the transfer market&quot;. The same newspaper article made it clear that Jason was never found guilty of any wrongdoing, and it quoted Alex Ferguson as saying: Subsequent interviews on BBC programmes such as &quot;Match of the Day&quot; were done by his assistants, latterly Mike Phelan.

Under new Premier League rules intended for the 2010–11 season, Ferguson was required to end his BBC boycott. However, he refused to end his boycott and Manchester United said they would pay the resulting fines. No fines were ever issued, as the BBC hoped to resolve the dispute. On 25 August 2011, Ferguson met with BBC director general Mark Thompson and BBC North director Peter Salmon, after which Ferguson agreed to end his seven-year boycott.

===Referees===

Ferguson has received numerous punishments for abusing and publicly criticising match officials when he has perceived them to be at fault:
* 20 October 2003 – Two-match touchline ban and fined £10,000 after using abusive and/or insulting words towards fourth official Jeff Winter.
* 14 December 2007 – Two-match touchline ban and fined £5,000 after using abusive and/or insulting words towards Mark Clattenburg.
* 18 November 2008 – Two-match touchline ban and fined £10,000 after confronting Mike Dean after a game.
* 12 November 2009 – Four-match touchline ban (two suspended) and fined £20,000 for comments made about the fitness of Alan Wiley.
* 16 March 2011 – Five-match touchline ban (three plus the two suspended for the above offence) and fined £30,000 for comments made questioning the performance and fairness of Martin Atkinson.

====&quot;Fergie Time&quot;====
It has also been suggested that Ferguson&#x27;s intimidation of referees resulted in so-called &quot;Fergie Time&quot;: that is, unusually generous injury time being added in matches where Manchester United were behind. The phrase is at least as old as 1998, but the concept first appeared on 10 April 1993 when Steve Bruce scored a 97th-minute goal (seventh minute of injury time added on by the referee) against Sheffield Wednesday to win the game for United: they went top of the league with this win and remained there until the season ended. The term got wider coverage when United came from behind to win the 1999 UEFA Champions League final with two goals in injury time.

The concept cropped up in the media (and by opponents) whenever games seemed to be having more injury time than expected. A statistical analysis by &quot;The Times&quot; suggests that this concept might be valid, though the article points out that other footballing criteria may explain the correlation between extra added time and United being behind. Analysis by Opta Sports of Premier League matches played between 2010 and 2012 found on average that 79 seconds more time was played in matches where Manchester United were losing. This was a greater figure than for other top clubs, although most of these clubs seem to benefit from a &quot;Fergie Time&quot; effect, particularly in their home matches.

==Legacy==
Many of Ferguson&#x27;s former players have gone on to become football managers themselves, including Tony Fitzpatrick, Alex McLeish, Gordon Strachan, Mark McGhee, Willie Miller, Neale Cooper, Bryan Gunn, Eric Black, Billy Stark, Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, Mark Hughes, Roy Keane, Paul Ince, Chris Casper, Mark Robins, Darren Ferguson, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Henning Berg, Andrei Kanchelskis, Michael Appleton, Ryan Giggs, David Healy, Gabriel Heinze, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville, Jaap Stam, Michael Carrick, Wayne Rooney and Phil Neville. Three of these have subsequently managed Manchester United: Giggs (interim player-manager in 2014), Solskjær (2018 to 2021), and Carrick (interim manager in 2021).

The phrase &quot;squeaky-bum time&quot;, coined by Ferguson in reference to the tense final stages of a league competition, was included in the &quot;Collins English Dictionary&quot; and the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

A bronze statue of Ferguson, designed by Scottish sculptor Philip Jackson, was unveiled outside Old Trafford on 23 November 2012. On 14 October 2013, Ferguson attended a ceremony where a road near Old Trafford was renamed from Water&#x27;s Reach to Sir Alex Ferguson Way. In July 2021, Aberdeen commissioned sculptor Andy Edwards to sculpt a bronze statue of Ferguson. This was unveiled at Aberdeen&#x27;s Pittodrie stadium on 25 February 2022, and on the following day Ferguson was presented with a maquette of the statue.

A documentary about Ferguson&#x27;s career titled &quot;Sir Alex Ferguson: Never Give In&quot; was released in UK cinemas on 27 May 2021 and was made available on Amazon Prime Video in the UK and Ireland on 29 May. It includes interviews from Ferguson himself, his family, doctors and former players who he managed throughout his career.

==Personal life==
Ferguson lives in Wilmslow, Cheshire, and was married to Cathy Holding from 1966 until her death in October 2023. They had three sons together: Mark (born 1968); and twins Darren, who was also a professional footballer and currently the manager of Peterborough United; and Jason (born 1972), who runs an events management company. Jason directed the 2021 documentary &quot;Sir Alex Ferguson: Never Give In&quot; about his father.

In 1998, Ferguson was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to the Labour Party. He is a self-described socialist. In January 2011 Graham Stringer, a Labour MP in Manchester and Manchester United supporter, called for Ferguson to be made a life peer. Stringer and fellow Manchester Labour MP Paul Goggins repeated this call after Ferguson announced his retirement in May 2013.

In 2009, Ferguson received an honorary doctorate in business administration from the Manchester Metropolitan University.

As well as having an ambassadorial role at Manchester United and other public speaking and charity engagements in retirement, he is a long-term patron of his childhood team Harmony Row, including a successful campaign for the club to have new facilities (they are now based at Braehead).

In the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Ferguson supported Scotland remaining in the United Kingdom. He criticised the Scottish Government and First Minister Alex Salmond for denying the vote to Scots living in the UK but outside Scotland. He also objected to the self-imposed rule by the Yes Scotland campaign against accepting donations from people living outside Scotland of more than £500, which they urged the No campaign to also adopt.

Ferguson underwent an emergency surgery on 5 May 2018, after having a brain haemorrhage. He made a recovery from the surgery and attended his first match at Old Trafford since then on 22 September 2018.

In 1991, Ferguson became a wine collector after being shown a display of bottles from Château d&#x27;Yquem and Château Pétrus while in Montpellier, France. In 2014, he put part of his vast collection up for auction with Christie&#x27;s, with their head of wine David Elswood describing his taste as &quot;exceptional&quot;, valued at up to £3 million. After the first of three auctions, Ferguson had sold 229 lots for £2.2 million.

After retiring from managing Manchester United in 2013, Ferguson continued to serve as an ambassador and director for the club. In October 2024, it was announced that at the end of the season he will leave his official role as club ambassador.

===Manager===
Ferguson was made an Inaugural Inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 in recognition of his impact on the English game as a manager. In 2003, Ferguson became an inaugural recipient of the FA Coaching Diploma, awarded to all coaches who had at least ten years&#x27; experience of being a manager or head coach. He is the Vice-President of the National Football Museum, based in Manchester, and a member of the Executive Committee of the League Managers Association. On 5 November 2011, the Old Trafford North Stand was officially renamed the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand in honour of his 25 years as manager of Manchester United.

In addition to being the only manager to win the top league honours, and the &#x27;Double&#x27;, north and south of the England–Scotland border (winning the Premier League with Manchester United, and the Scottish Premier Division with Aberdeen), he is also the last manager to win the Scottish league championship with a non Old Firm team, achieving this in the 1984–85 season with Aberdeen.

Ferguson is the second-most decorated manager in European football competitions with seven honours, behind only Carlo Ancelotti. Ferguson won the top division title in England a record 13 times. He is also the first manager in the history of the English league to win three consecutive league titles, which he did twice. Ferguson won 10 Manager of the Year awards, 27 Manager of the Month awards, and managed the most games in the UEFA Champions League (190). In 2017, Ferguson was named among the 10 most influential coaches since the foundation of UEFA in 1954.

<text>The Solent ( ) is a strait between the Isle of Wight and mainland Great Britain; the major historic ports of Southampton and Portsmouth lie inland of its shores. It is about long and varies in width between , although the Hurst Spit which projects into the Solent narrows the sea crossing between Hurst Castle and Colwell Bay to just over .

The Solent is a major shipping lane for passenger, freight and military vessels. It is also an important recreational area for water sports, particularly yachting, hosting the Cowes Week sailing event annually. It is sheltered by the Isle of Wight and has a complex tidal pattern, which has benefited Southampton&#x27;s success as a port, providing a &quot;double high tide&quot; that extends the tidal window during which deep-draught ships can be handled. Spithead, an area off Gilkicker Point near Gosport, is known as the place where the Royal Navy is traditionally reviewed by the monarch of the day.

The area is of great ecological and landscape importance, particularly because of the coastal and estuarine habitats along its edge. Much of its coastline is designated as a Special Area of Conservation. It is bordered by and forms a part of the character of a number of nationally important protected landscapes including the New Forest National Park, and the Isle of Wight AONB.

==Etymology==
The word predates Old English, and is first recorded in 731 as &quot;Soluente&quot; (Bede, &quot;H.E.&quot; 4, 16). This original spelling suggests a possible derivation from the Brittonic element &quot;-uente&quot;, which has endured throughout the history of Hampshire, as in the Roman city of Venta Belgarum (Latinised as &quot;Venta&quot;), the post-Roman kingdom of Y Went, and the modern name of Winchester.

It later appears in Anglo-Saxon records as &quot;Solentan&quot;.

A pre-Celtic and supposedly Semitic root meaning &quot;free-standing rock&quot; has also been suggested as a possible description of the cliffs marking western approach of the strait. This Semitic origin may be a relic of the Phoenician traders who sailed to Britain from the Mediterranean as part of the ancient tin trade.

Another suggestion is that the name may reflect the number of Northern Gannets (previously known as Solans or the Solan Goose) along the coast.

==Geology==
Originally a river valley, the Solent has gradually widened and deepened over many thousands of years. The River Frome was the source of the River Solent, with four other rivers—the Rivers Avon, Hamble, Itchen and Test—being tributaries of it. Seismic sounding has shown that, when the sea level was lower, the River Solent incised its bed to a depth of at least below current Ordnance Datum.

The Purbeck Ball Clay contains kaolinite and mica, showing that in the Lutetian stage of the Eocene water from a granite area, probably Dartmoor, flowed into the River Solent.

Seabed survey shows that when the sea level was lower in the Ice Age the River Solent continued the line of the eastern Solent (Spithead) to a point roughly due east of the east end of the Isle of Wight and due south of a point about west of Selsey Bill, and then south-south-west for about , and then south for about , and then joined the main river flowing down the dry bed of the English Channel.

During the Ice Age, meanders of the Solent&#x27;s tributaries became incised: for example, an incised meander of the River Test is buried under reclaimed land under the Westquay shopping centre, near Southampton docks;

Since the retreat of the most recent glaciation, the South East of England, like the Netherlands, has been steadily slowly sinking through historic time due to forebulge sinking.

In 2008 a new theory—that the Solent was originally a lagoon—was reported in the &quot;Southern Daily Echo&quot; by Garry Momber from the Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology.

The Isle of Wight was formerly contiguous with the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset—the Needles on Wight and Old Harry Rocks on Purbeck are the last remnant of this connection.

Ten thousand years ago a band of relatively resistant chalk rock, part of the Southern England Chalk Formation, ran from the Isle of Purbeck area of south Dorset to the eastern end of Isle of Wight, parallel to the South Downs. Inland behind the chalk were less resistant sands, clays and gravels. Through these weak soils and rocks ran many rivers, from the Dorset Frome in the west and including the Stour, Beaulieu River, Test, Itchen and Hamble, which created a large estuary flowing west to east and into the English Channel at the eastern end of the present Solent. This great estuary ran through a wooded valley and is now referred to as the Solent River.

When glaciers covering more northern latitudes melted at the end of the last ice age, two things happened to create the Solent. Firstly, a great amount of flood water ran into the Solent River and its tributaries, carving the estuary deeper. Secondly, post-glacial rebound after the removal of the weight of ice over Scotland caused the island of Great Britain to tilt about an east–west axis, because isostatic rebound in Scotland and Scandinavia is pulling mantle rock out from under the Netherlands and south England: this is forebulge sinking.

Over thousands of years, the land sank in the south (a process still continuing) to submerge many valleys creating today&#x27;s characteristic rias, such as Southampton Water and Poole Harbour, as well as submerging the Solent. The estuary of the Solent River was gradually flooded, and eventually the Isle of Wight became separated from the mainland as the chalk ridge between The Needles on the island and Old Harry Rocks on the mainland was eroded. This is thought to have happened about 7,500 years ago.

The process of coastal change is still continuing, with the soft cliffs on some parts of the Solent, such as Fort Victoria, constantly eroding, whilst other parts, such as Ryde Sands, are accreting.

The Solent is a comparatively shallow stretch of tidal water. It has an unusual double tide that is both favourable and hazardous to maritime activities with its strong tidal movements and quickly changing sea states.

Coupled with the above, the Solent is renowned for its large volume of vessel usage, thus resulting in one of the highest density of declared lifeboat stations in the world. This includes six RNLI (e.g. Calshot and Cowes) and five independently run stations (e.g. Hamble Lifeboat and Gosport and Fareham Inshore Rescue Service).

==History==
Remains of human habitation have been found from the prehistoric, Roman, and Saxon eras, showing that humans retreated towards progressively higher ground over these periods. Offshore from Bouldnor, Isle of Wight, divers have found at depth the submerged remains of a wooden building that was built there on land around 6000 BC when the sea level was lower and the land was higher.

There is an early Norman period report that much land on the south of Hayling Island was lost to sea flood. South of Hayling Island in the Solent is a deposit of stones, which scuba divers found to be the remains of a stone building, probably a church. There is an old report that this church was formerly in the middle of Hayling Island. If similar amounts of land have been lost on other parts of the Solent shore, the Solent was likely to have been much narrower in Roman times, and it is possible to believe Diodorus Siculus&#x27;s report that in his time men could wade to the Isle of Wight at low tide.

In the early 16th century, Henry VIII of England built an extensive set of coastal defences at each end of the Solent, part of his Device Forts, effectively controlling access to east and west. In 1545, a naval battle was fought in the Solent between English and French naval forces. The battle was inconclusive with no significant losses other than Henry VIII&#x27;s flagship, the &quot;Mary Rose&quot;, which foundered and sank while making a sharp turn. From a total crew of over 400 (some estimates have suggested as many as 700), fewer than 35 survived the sinking. The remains of the &quot;Mary Rose&quot; were discovered at the bottom of the Solent by a salvage project in 1971 and were successfully salvaged in 1982. The remains of the hull and a large number of artefacts can be seen in the Mary Rose Museum located in the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard.

In 1685, King James II narrowly escaped shipwreck while sailing in the Solent. Musician Henry Purcell wrote &quot;They that go down to the sea in ships&quot; to be sung by the extraordinary voice of John Gostling in commemoration of this event. More forts were built on land and at sea in the 19th century. These were generally known as Palmerston Forts.

The Solent was one of two sites for the sailing events at the 1908 Summer Olympics. The Solent became the departure area of the ill-fated ocean liner, &quot;Titanic&quot;, in April 1912.

A bank in the centre of the Solent, Bramble Bank, is exposed at low water at spring tide. This, combined with the unique tidal patterns in the area, makes navigation challenging. There is an annual cricket match on Bramble Bank during the lowest tide of the year, but games are often cut short by rising tide.

According to the BBC, the at Ryde gives a major advantage to hovercraft which can travel right up a beach and the Solent is the only place in Western Europe where there is a regular passenger service. The operator, Hovertravel, claims it is the world&#x27;s only commercial passenger hovercraft. It celebrated 50 years of operation in 2015.

<doc id="43234" wikidata="Q647349" url="?curid=43234" title="Green flash">
<text>The green flash and green ray are meteorological optical phenomena that sometimes occur transiently around the moment of sunset or sunrise. When the conditions are right, a distinct green spot is briefly visible above the Sun&#x27;s upper ; the green appearance usually lasts for no more than two seconds. Rarely, the green flash can resemble a green ray shooting up from the sunset or sunrise point.

Green flashes occur because the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere can cause the light from the Sun to separate, or refract, into different colors. Green flashes are a group of similar phenomena that stem from slightly different causes, and therefore, some types of green flashes are more common than others.

== Observing ==

Green flashes may be observed from any altitude. They usually are seen at an unobstructed horizon, such as over the ocean, but are possible over cloud tops and mountain tops as well. They may occur at any latitude, although at the equator, the flash rarely lasts longer than a second.

The green flash also may be observed in association with the Moon and bright planets at the horizon, including Venus and Jupiter. With an unrestricted view of the horizon, green flashes are regularly seen by airline pilots, particularly when flying westwards as the sunset is slowed. If the atmosphere is layered, the green flash may appear as a series of flashes.

While observing at the Vatican Observatory in 1960, D.J.K. O&#x27;Connell produced the first color photograph of the green flash at sunset.

==Explanation==

Green flash occurs because the atmosphere causes the light from the Sun to separate, or refract, into different frequencies. Green flashes are enhanced by mirages, which increase refraction. A green flash is more likely to be seen in stable, clear air, when more of the light from the setting sun reaches the observer without being scattered. One might expect to see a blue flash, since blue light is refracted most of all and the blue component of the sun&#x27;s light is therefore the last to disappear below the horizon, but the blue is preferentially scattered out of the line of sight, and the remaining light ends up appearing green.

With slight magnification, a green rim on the top of the solar disk may be seen on most clear-day sunsets, although the flash or ray effects require a stronger layering of the atmosphere and a mirage, which serves to magnify the green from a fraction of a second to a couple of seconds.

While simple atmospheric refraction or lensing explains the background gradient of red-amber twilight, the primary potential cause of the bright, verdant discontinuity from that gradient known as the Green Flash may be due to naturally-occurring coherent (laser) light. Part of this phenomenon was recently discovered by researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine, regarding infrared-laser light converting-up (or upconverting) to visible-green laser light, causing what researchers there call &quot;a double hit&quot; of photons on the retina, creating the perception of bright neon green from an originally invisible infrared laser. 

Doubling the wavelength of green light yields roughly 1000-1100 nm infrared light, so the most likely hypothesis is that the Green Flash is coherent upconverted infrared (laser) light that &quot;double-hits&quot; the retina or camera lens, creating the effect of bright green (additionally, this explains why the Green Flash is also sometimes blue or purple; coherent infrared light can upconvert to any color of visible light if the conditions are met).

==Types==

The &quot;green flash&quot; description relates to a group of optical phenomena, some of which are listed below:

The majority of flashes observed are inferior-mirage or mock-mirage effects, with the others constituting only 1% of reports. Some types not listed in the table above, such as the cloud-top flash (seen as the Sun sinks into a coastal fog, or at distant cumulus clouds), are not understood.

===Blue flashes===
On rare occasion, the amount of blue light is sufficient to be visible as a &quot;blue flash&quot;.
===Green rim===


As an astronomical object sets or rises in relation to the horizon, the light it emits travels through Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, which works as a prism separating the light into different colors. The color of the upper rim of an astronomical object could go from green to blue to violet depending on the decrease in concentration of pollutants as they spread throughout an increasing volume of atmosphere. The lower rim of an astronomical object is always red. A green rim is very thin and is difficult or impossible to see with the naked eye. In usual conditions, a green rim of an astronomical object gets fainter when an astronomical object is very low above the horizon because of atmospheric reddening, but sometimes the conditions are right to see a green rim just above the horizon.

The following quote describes what was probably the longest observation of a green rim, which at times could have been a green flash. It was seen on and off for 35 minutes by members of the Richard Evelyn Byrd party from the Antarctic Little America exploration base in 1934:

For the explorers to have seen a green rim on and off for 35 minutes, there must have been some mirage effect present.

A green rim is present at every sunset, but it is too thin to be seen with the naked eye. Often a green rim changes to a green flash and back again during the same sunset. The best time to observe a green rim is about 10 minutes before sunset. That is too early to use any magnification like binoculars or a telescope to look directly at the Sun without potential harm to the eyes. (Of course, a magnified image might be projected onto a sheet of paper for safe viewing.) As the Sun gets closer to the horizon, the green rim becomes fainter due to atmospheric reddening. According to the above, it is probably correct to conclude that although a green rim is present during every sunset, a green flash is rarer because of the required mirage.

==In popular culture==

Jules Verne&#x27;s 1882 novel &quot;The Green Ray&quot; helped to popularize the green flash phenomenon. 

In the 1984 film The Island Closest to Heaven Yuichi Fukaya took Mari, the main character to watch the sunset and told about the green flash after the sun sinks into the sea. According to him those people who saw it will be able to find what they are for looking for.
In Éric Rohmer&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;The Green Ray&quot; (French: &quot;Le rayon vert&quot;), the main character, Delphine, eavesdrops on a conversation about Jules Verne&#x27;s novel and the significance of the green flash, eventually witnessing the phenomenon herself in the final scene.

In &quot;Arthur&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot; from the first season of &quot;Arthur&quot; in 1996, Arthur Read, having never stayed up until midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve before, talks with his friends about what happens when the New Year comes. Despite not actually having stayed up themselves, they each share their take on the matter, Prunella Deegan telling him that there is an amazing green flash at midnight, but if it doesn&#x27;t happen, then it has to stay the same year for another whole year.

In 2002, the City of San Diego installed an art piece titled &quot;The Green Flash&quot; by Malcolm Jones next to the beach boardwalk in Mission Beach. The acrylic and concrete work also includes a plaque that describes the scientific phenomenon. 

Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; 2007 movie &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot; references the green flash as a signal that a soul had returned from the dead.

The episode &quot;Trials and Determinations!&quot; of Pokémon the Series: Sun &amp; Moon references the green flash when Ash&#x27;s Rockruff evolves into Dusk Form Lycanroc after witnessing a green flash at sunset.

<doc id="43236" wikidata="Q7246" url="?curid=43236" title="Unicorn">
<text>The unicorn is a legendary creature that has been described since antiquity as a beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead.

In European literature and art, the unicorn has for the last thousand years or so been depicted as a white horse- or goat-like animal with a long straight horn with spiralling grooves, cloven hooves, and sometimes a goat&#x27;s beard. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it was commonly described as an extremely wild woodland creature, a symbol of purity and grace, which could be captured only by a virgin. In encyclopedias, its horn was described as having the power to render poisoned water potable and to heal sickness. In medieval and Renaissance times, the tusk of the narwhal was sometimes sold as a unicorn horn.

A bovine type of unicorn is thought by some scholars to have been depicted in seals of the Bronze Age Indus Valley civilization, the interpretation remaining controversial. An equine form of the unicorn was mentioned by the ancient Greeks in accounts of natural history by various writers, including Ctesias, Strabo, Pliny the Younger, Aelian, and Cosmas Indicopleustes. The Bible also describes an animal, the re&#x27;em, which some translations render as &quot;unicorn&quot;.

The unicorn continues to hold a place in popular culture. It is often used as a symbol of fantasy or rarity. In the 21st century, it has become an LGBTQ symbol.

== History ==
===Indus Valley civilization===
A creature with a single horn, conventionally called a unicorn, is the most common image on the soapstone stamp seals of the Bronze Age Indus Valley civilization (&quot;IVC&quot;), from the centuries around 2000 BC. It has a body more like a cow than a horse, and a curved horn that goes forward, then up at the tip. The mysterious feature depicted coming down from the front of the back is usually shown; it may represent a harness or other covering. Typically, the unicorn faces a vertical object with at least two stages; this is variously described as a &quot;ritual offering stand&quot;, an incense burner, or a manger. The animal is always in profile on Indus seals, but the theory that it represents animals with two horns, one hiding the other, is disproved by a (much smaller) number of small terracotta unicorns, probably toys, and the profile depictions of bulls, where both horns are clearly shown. It is thought that the unicorn was the symbol of a powerful &quot;clan or merchant community&quot;, but may also have had some religious significance.

In South Asia, the unicorn is only seen during the IVC period, and disappeared in South Asian art after this. Jonathan Mark Kenoyer stated the IVC &quot;unicorn&quot; has no &quot;direct connection&quot; with later unicorn motifs observed in other parts of the world; nonetheless, it remains possible that the IVC unicorn had contributed to later myths of fantastical one-horned creatures in West Asia.

=== Classical antiquity ===
Unicorns are not found in Greek mythology, but rather in the accounts of natural history, for Greek writers of natural history were convinced of the reality of unicorns, which they believed lived in India, a distant and fabulous realm for them. The earliest description is from Ctesias, who in his book &quot;Indika&quot; (&quot;On India&quot;) described them as wild asses, fleet of foot, having a horn a cubit and a half () in length, and colored white, red and black. Unicorn meat was said to be too bitter to eat.
Ctesias got his information while living in Persia. Unicorns or, more likely, winged bulls, appear in reliefs at the ancient Persian capital of Persepolis in Iran. Aristotle must be following Ctesias when he mentions two one-horned animals, the oryx (a kind of antelope) and the so-called &quot;Indian ass&quot; (). Antigonus of Carystus also wrote about the one-horned &quot;Indian ass&quot;. Strabo says that in the Caucasus there were one-horned horses with stag-like heads. Pliny the Elder mentions the oryx and an Indian ox (perhaps a greater one-horned rhinoceros) as one-horned beasts, as well as &quot;a very fierce animal called the monoceros which has the head of the stag, the feet of the elephant, and the tail of the boar, while the rest of the body is like that of the horse; it makes a deep lowing noise, and has a single black horn, which projects from the middle of its forehead, two cubits [] in length.&quot; In &quot;On the Nature of Animals&quot; (, ), Aelian, quoting Ctesias, adds that India produces also a one-horned horse (iii. 41; iv. 52), and says (xvi. 20) that the () was sometimes called (), which may be a form of the Arabic , meaning &#x27;rhinoceros&#x27;.

Cosmas Indicopleustes, a 6th-century Greek traveler who journeyed to India and the Kingdom of Aksum, gives a description of a unicorn based on four bronze figures he saw in the four-towered palace of the King of Ethiopia. He states, from report: They speak of him as a terrible beast and quite invincible and that all its strength lies in its horn. When he finds himself pursued by many hunters and on the point of being caught, he springs up to the top of some precipice whence he throws himself down and in the descent turns a somersault so that the horn sustains all the shock of the fall, and he escapes unhurt.

=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===


Medieval knowledge of unicorns stemmed from biblical and ancient sources, and unicorns were variously represented as a kind of wild ass, goat, or horse.

Several European medieval travelers claimed to have seen unicorns in their travels outside of Europe. For example Felix Fabri claimed to have seen a unicorn in Sinai.

The predecessor of the medieval bestiary, compiled in Late Antiquity and known as (), popularized an elaborate allegory in which a unicorn, trapped by a maiden (representing the Virgin Mary), stood for the Incarnation. As soon as the unicorn sees her, it lays its head on her lap and falls asleep. This became a basic emblematic tag that underlies medieval notions of the unicorn, justifying its appearance in both secular and religious art. The unicorn is often shown hunted, raising parallels both with vulnerable virgins and sometimes the Passion of Christ. The myths refer to a beast with one horn that can only be tamed by a virgin; subsequently, some writers translated this into an allegory for Christ&#x27;s relationship with the Virgin Mary.

The unicorn also figured in courtly terms: for some 13th-century French authors such as Thibaut of Champagne and Richard de Fournival, the lover is attracted to his lady as the unicorn is to the virgin. With the rise of humanism, the unicorn also acquired more orthodox secular meanings, emblematic of chaste love and faithful marriage. It plays this role in Petrarch&#x27;s &quot;Triumph of Chastity&quot;, and on the reverse of Piero della Francesca&#x27;s portrait of Battista Strozzi, paired with that of her husband Federico da Montefeltro (painted 1472–74), Bianca&#x27;s triumphal car is drawn by a pair of unicorns.

However, when the unicorn appears in the medieval legend of &quot;Barlaam and Josaphat&quot;, ultimately derived from the life of the Buddha, it represents death, as the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; explains. Unicorns in religious art largely disappeared after they were condemned by Molanus after the Council of Trent.

The unicorn, tamable only by a virgin woman, was well established in medieval lore by the time Marco Polo described them as &quot;scarcely smaller than elephants. They have the hair of a buffalo and feet like an elephant&#x27;s. They have a single large black horn in the middle of the forehead... They have a head like a wild boar&#x27;s... They spend their time by preference wallowing in mud and slime. They are very ugly brutes to look at. They are not at all such as we describe them when we relate that they let themselves be captured by virgins, but clean contrary to our notions.&quot; It is clear that Marco Polo was describing a rhinoceros.

==== Alicorn ====

The horn itself and the substance it was made of was called alicorn, and it was believed that the horn holds magical and medicinal properties. The Danish physician Ole Worm determined in 1638 that the alleged alicorns were the tusks of narwhals. Such beliefs were examined wittily and at length in 1646 by Sir Thomas Browne in his &quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica&quot;.

False alicorn powder, made from the tusks of narwhals or horns of various animals, was sold in Europe for medicinal purposes as late as 1741. The alicorn was thought to cure many diseases and have the ability to detect poisons, and many physicians would make &quot;cures&quot; and sell them. Cups were made from alicorn for kings and given as a gift; these were usually made of ivory or walrus ivory. Entire horns were very precious in the Middle Ages and were often really the tusks of narwhals.

== Entrapment ==
One traditional method of hunting unicorns involved entrapment by a virgin.

In one of his notebooks Leonardo da Vinci wrote:

The famous late Gothic series of seven tapestry hangings &quot;The Hunt of the Unicorn&quot; are a high point in European tapestry manufacture, combining both secular and religious themes. The tapestries now hang in the Cloisters division of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. In the series, richly dressed noblemen, accompanied by huntsmen and hounds, pursue a unicorn against backgrounds or settings of buildings and gardens. They bring the animal to bay with the help of a maiden who traps it with her charms, appear to kill it, and bring it back to a castle; in the last and most famous panel, &quot;The Unicorn in Captivity&quot;, the unicorn is shown alive again and happy, chained to a pomegranate tree surrounded by a fence, in a field of flowers. Scholars conjecture that the red stains on its flanks are not blood but rather the juice from pomegranates, which were a symbol of fertility. However, the true meaning of the mysterious resurrected unicorn in the last panel is unclear. The series was woven about 1500 in the Low Countries, probably Brussels or Liège, for an unknown patron. A set of six engravings on the same theme, treated rather differently, were engraved by the French artist Jean Duvet in the 1540s.

Another famous set of six tapestries of (&quot;Lady with the unicorn&quot;) in the Musée de Cluny, Paris, were also woven in the Southern Netherlands before 1500, and show the five senses (the gateways to temptation) and finally Love (&quot;&quot; the legend reads), with unicorns featured in each piece. Facsimiles of these unicorn tapestries were woven for permanent display in Stirling Castle, Scotland, to take the place of a set recorded in the castle in a 16th-century inventory.

A rather rare, late-15th-century, variant depiction of the &quot;hortus conclusus&quot; in religious art combined the Annunciation to Mary with the themes of the &quot;Hunt of the Unicorn&quot; and &quot;Virgin and Unicorn&quot;, so popular in secular art. The unicorn already functioned as a symbol of the Incarnation and whether this meaning is intended in many &quot;prima facie&quot; secular depictions can be a difficult matter of scholarly interpretation. There is no such ambiguity in the scenes where the archangel Gabriel is shown blowing a horn, as hounds chase the unicorn into the Virgin&#x27;s arms, and a little Christ Child descends on rays of light from God the Father. The Council of Trent finally banned this somewhat over-elaborated, if charming, depiction, partly on the grounds of realism, as no one now believed the unicorn to be a real animal.

Shakespeare scholars describe unicorns being captured by a hunter standing in front of a tree, the unicorn goaded into charging; the hunter would step aside the last moment and the unicorn would embed its horn deeply into the tree (See annotations of Timon of Athens, Act 4, scene 3, c. line 341: &quot;wert thou the unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury&quot;.)

== Heraldry ==

In heraldry, a unicorn is often depicted as a horse with a goat&#x27;s cloven hooves and beard, a lion&#x27;s tail, and a slender, spiral horn on its forehead (non-equine attributes may be replaced with equine ones). Whether because it was an emblem of the Incarnation or of the fearsome animal passions of raw nature, the unicorn was not widely used in early heraldry, but became popular from the 15th century. Though sometimes shown collared and chained, which may be taken as an indication that it has been tamed or tempered, it is more usually shown collared with a broken chain attached, showing that it has broken free from its bondage.

=== Scotland ===

In heraldry the unicorn is best known as a symbol of Scotland: the unicorn was believed to be the natural enemy of the lion – a symbol that the English royals had adopted around a hundred years before Two unicorns supported the royal arms of the King of Scots and Duke of Rothesay, and since the 1707 union of England and Scotland, the royal arms of the United Kingdom have been supported by a unicorn along with an English lion. Two versions of the royal arms exist: that used in Scotland gives more emphasis to the Scottish elements, placing the unicorn on the left and giving it a crown, whereas the version used in England and elsewhere gives the English elements more prominence. John Guillim, in his book; &quot;A Display of Heraldry&quot;, has illustrated the unicorn as a symbol of power, honor and respect.

Golden coins known as the unicorn and half-unicorn, both with a unicorn on the obverse, were used in Scotland in the 15th and 16th century. In the same realm, carved unicorns were often used as finials on the pillars of Mercat crosses, and denoted that the settlement was a royal burgh. Certain noblemen such as the Earl of Kinnoull were given special permission to use the unicorn in their arms, as an augmentation of honour. The crest for Clan Cunningham bears a unicorn head.

== Queer culture ==
By the beginning of the 21st century, unicorns became a queer icon, second only to the rainbow flag, symbolizing queerness.

The rainbow flag, created by American artist Gilbert Baker in 1978 as a joyous symbol of the diversity of the queer community, became prominent during the gay rights protests of the 1970s and 1980s. Unicorns, which were intrinsically linked to rainbows since the Victorian era, became a symbol of the queer community.

There is no consensus on how the unicorn became a gay icon. Alice Fisher, an editor of Observer Design magazine, notes that the values of a unicorn – as rare and magical – have resulted in the word being used with various connotations. However, she argues that the Victorian association between rainbows and unicorns has resulted in unicorns becoming a queer icon.

When directly asked, queer people give different answers about why they have close personal relationships with unicorns. They often relate to one or more of the following aspects: uniqueness, magical quality, elusiveness and gender fluidity.

Queer individuals tend to relate to the unicorn because of their unique sexual orientation and gender identity. A New Orleans journalist who identifies as queer, Tracey Anne Duncan, described her connection to unicorns when she watched &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; as a child. In the film, the protagonist believed she was one of a kind throughout her life. Tracey was able to relate to that feeling, even though she did not really know what &quot;her kind&quot; was at that time.

The unicorn is an imaginary animal that lives in a world of myths and legends. Queer people, whose existence may seem to blur the lines between societal norms of masculinity and femininity, may feel like they do not fully belong in this world. It explains their interests in mythical creatures such as unicorns, mermaids, and fairies.

Some argue that the gender fluidity of the unicorn makes it a suitable representation of the LGBT community. In ancient myths, the unicorn is portrayed as male, whereas in the modern times, it is depicted as a female creature.

== Similar animals in religion and myth ==
=== Biblical ===
An animal called the &quot;re&#x27;em&quot; () is mentioned in several places in the Hebrew Bible, often as a metaphor representing strength. The allusions to the &quot;re&#x27;em&quot; as a wild, untamable animal of great strength and agility, with mighty horn or horns best fit the aurochs (&quot;Bos primigenius&quot;); this view is further supported by the Assyrian cognate word &quot;rimu,&quot; which is often used as a metaphor of strength, and is depicted as a powerful, fierce, wild mountain bull with large horns. This animal was often depicted in ancient Mesopotamian art in profile, with only one horn visible.

The translators of the Authorized King James Version of the Bible (1611) followed the Greek Septuagint (&quot;monokeros&quot;) and the Latin Vulgate (&quot;unicornis&quot;) and employed &quot;unicorn&quot; to translate &quot;re&#x27;em&quot;, providing a recognizable animal that was proverbial for its untamable nature. The American Standard Version translates this term &quot;wild ox&quot; in each case.

The classical Jewish understanding of the Bible did not identify the &quot;Re&#x27;em&quot; animal as the unicorn. However, some rabbis in the Talmud debate the proposition that the &quot;Tahash&quot; animal (Exodus 25, 26, 35, 36 and 39; Numbers 4; and Ezekiel 16:10) was a domestic, single-horned kosher creature that existed in Moses&#x27; time, or that it was similar to the &quot;keresh&quot; animal described in Marcus Jastrow&#x27;s Talmudic dictionary as &quot;a kind of antelope, unicorn&quot;.

===Chinese mythology===

The &quot;qilin&quot; (), a creature in Chinese mythology, is sometimes called &quot;the Chinese unicorn&quot;, and some ancient accounts describe a single horn as its defining feature. However, it is more accurately described as a hybrid animal that looks less unicorn than chimera, with the body of a deer, the head of a lion, green scales and a long forwardly-curved horn. The Japanese version (&quot;kirin&quot;) more closely resembles the Western unicorn, even though it is based on the Chinese &quot;qilin&quot;. The Quẻ Ly of Vietnamese myth, similarly sometimes mistranslated &quot;unicorn&quot; is a symbol of wealth and prosperity that made its first appearance during the Duong dynasty, about 600 CE, to Emperor Duong Cao To, after a military victory which resulted in his conquest of Tây Nguyên. In November 2012 the History Institute of the DPRK Academy of Social Sciences, as well as the Korea News Service, reported that the Kiringul had been found, which is associated with a kirin ridden by King Dongmyeong of Goguryeo.

Beginning in the Ming dynasty, the &quot;qilin&quot; became associated with giraffes, after Zheng He&#x27;s voyage to East Africa brought a pair of the long-necked animals and introduced them at court in Nanjing as &quot;qilin&quot;. The resemblance to the &quot;qilin&quot; was noted in the giraffe&#x27;s ossicones (bony protrusions from the skull resembling horns), graceful movements, and peaceful demeanor.

&quot;Shanhaijing&quot; (117) mentioned the &quot;Bo&quot;-horse (), a chimera horse with an ox tail, a single horn, a white body, and a sound like a person calling. The creature was said to live at Honest-head Mountain. Guo Pu in his &quot;jiangfu&quot; said that the &quot;Bo&quot;-horse was able to walk on water. Another similar creature, also mentioned in &quot;Shanhaijing&quot; (80) and said to live in Mount Winding-Centre, was the &quot;Bo&quot; (), but it had a black tail, tiger&#x27;s teeth and claws, devoured leopards and tigers.

== Hornless unicorn ==
In &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; tapestry set of (), it has been claimed, the &quot;Taste&quot; tapestry shows a young unicorn without a horn among the animals in the millefleur background, above the two women.

The alabaster burial monument of Henry Manners, 2nd Earl of Rutland shows a hornless unicorn at his feet.
